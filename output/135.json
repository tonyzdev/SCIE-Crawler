    "abstract": "Despite the vicinity of a major road, the rainforests of the South Nguru Mountains in eastern Tanzania were virtually unexplored until 2004, particularly from a herpetological point of view. Several surveys were conducted between 2004 and 2006 with the aim of providing a comprehensive list of the amphibian and reptile species of this overlooked hotspot of biological diversity. The surveys resulted in this assessment of the herpetofaunal diversity, with 92 species recorded, of which 15 represent new records for this area, and the discovery of 16 species new to science, all of which are likely to be strictly endemic to the Nguru Mountains. Pressure on the forests, particularly the lowland forests, remains high. A conservation planning process is now underway that is attempting to address the loss of these critically important forests. These results, documenting the high species richness and the outstanding number of putative endemics of the forests, strongly highlight the biological importance of the South Nguru Mountains and place them among the most important sites for the conservation of herpetofauna in Africa.",

Both females and males were captured in 2008, while only males were recorded in 2000. Females were significantly larger than males. Mean population age was 2.4 ± 0.9 years in 2000. In 2008, the difference in age was not significant between the sexes (Males: 3.0 ± 0.7, n = 21; Females: 2.6 ± 0.9, n = 12), neither between males in 2000 and 2008. The longev - ity in males of 2000 was 6 LAGs and exceeded that of males (5 LAGs) and females (4 LAGs) in 2008. Von Bertalanffy curves showed that the growth coefficient in the males of 2000 (K = 2.97 ± 0.47) was almost double that of females (K = 1.21 ± 0.10) and males (K = 1.01 ± 0.14) of 2008.

Furthermore, infection by parasites might be associated with consider - able deterioration of individual host fitness. While the apicomplexan parasites belonging to the genus Hepatozoon can provoke severe deleterious effects in some mammals, impact on other hosts, such as reptiles, is still unclear. We assessed the effect of Hepatozoon parasites on Podarcis vaucheri flight-initiation distance from a simulated predator, a behaviour that is determinant for a successful escape and is therefore likely to have major implications on a lizard's survival. We found that flight-initiation distance was not dependent on the time of the day or tail condition. Subadults exhibited worse body condition than adults and females had worse body condition than males. Regarding intensity of parasitism, subadults showed higher parasitemia levels. Escape distance was not associated with parasitic load or any of the other studied features, which is indicative of limited impact of the parasite. This negligible effect might explain the remarkably high prevalence (more than 96%) of this parasitic group within this P. vaucheri population.",

The potential influence of this global disaster on wildlife populations is subject to question. I interpolated how seasonal variation in weather patterns influences growth and reproduction in the Blanchard’s cricket frog ( Acris blanchardi ). Then I extrapolated the influence of future climate conditions on these life history characteristics using fuzzy regression. Fuzzy regression was an accurate predictor of growth and reproduction based on the climate conditions present from 1900–2007. It predicted that the climate projections expected for Arkansas by 2100 could reduce total reproductive investment in the Blanchard’s cricket frog by 33–94%. If these results reflect responses by other poikilotherms, climate change could induce major population declines in many species. Because poikilotherms represent the vast majority of vertebrates and significant ecosystem components, it is imperative that we implement strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and circumvent this possible catastrophe.",

In the view, we studied altitudinal variation in body size in the rice frog ( Rana limnocharis ) among populations from Sichuan province located at three altitudes to find if there exist any differences in a relatively small altitudinal range (290-375 m). The results showed that individuals from higher altitudes tended to be larger in body size than lower altitudes, which was consistent with Bergmann’s cline. Moreover, when the effect of age was removed, variation in body size of the frogs across altitudes still remained.

Here, we studied the helminths par - asitizing the Italian edible frog Pelophylax kl. hispanicus, giving special attention to the relationship between parasites and host traits such as sex, snout vent length, weight and body condition. The helminth community was composed of seven species: three trematode species (Diplodiscus subclavatus, Gorgodera cygnoides, Pleurogenes claviger), three nematode species (Icosiella neglecta, Oswaldocruzia filiformis , Rhabdias sp.) and one acanthocephalan species (Pom phorhychus laevis). We found that prevalence was positively correlated with snout-vent length and weight, but did not differ with body condition or sex. We found that prevalence and mean species richness increased with age. Our results show that abundance of Icosiella neglecta was positively correlated with higher values for host body condition. In fact, we found that high prevalence and mean species richness do not necessarily imply poorer body condition in the para- sitized host. In conclusion, our results show that the helminth community in this taxon has great diversity, and this host-parasite system seems to be evolved to low levels of virulence, helminths maintaining a commensal relationship with this frog.",

Three species were affected by railway mortality: Bufo bufo, Rana temporaria and Pelophylax kl. esculentus . Most dead individuals (77%) were adult common toads. The largest number (14) of amphibian breeding sites was located in the most heterogeneous habitats (woodland and rural areas), which coincides with the sectors of highest amphibian mortality (42% of all accidents).

Consequently, citizen science is of increasing importance for large scale data collection. In this study, we described the range boundaries of the four Hynobius species occurring in Korea based on genetic identification and refined their distribution through citizen science data. The genetic identification of individuals was extracted from the literature, while the citizen science data were extracted from iNaturalist through GBIF. Distribution boundary lines were drawn from the genetic data and consistency with citizen science datapoints was assessed through a comparative analysis with the points found beyond the established boundary lines. Depending on the species, 1.43 to 25.00% of the observations extracted from the citizen science data were located beyond the boundaries suggested by the molecular analyses, with average distances ranging from 3.51 ± 2.97 to 51.47 ± 30.87 km (mean ± SD). We considered these variations negligible in the view of the whole distribution of these species. In general, the distributions extracted from iNaturalist were accurate and adequately representative of the distribution of the species, with the exception of the recently split H. quelpaertensis . Additionally, citizen science data highlighted the absence of gaps in the distribution of these species. In conclusion, given the good accuracy of citizen science data, we recommend the publication of molecular based data so that citizen science platforms could help define accurately the range of species for which data is missing or outdated.",

We studied the microhabitat conditions of the sites occupied by several populations of S. algira along an altitudinal gradient, and the use of water bodies for reproduction. The microclimate conditions were analysed at six sites in northern Morocco: one site in Beni Snassen massif ( S. algira spelaea ), two in the Middle Atlas and central Rif mountains ( S. algira splendens ), and three in the western Rif mountains and Peninsula Tingitana ( S. algira tingitana ), where a viviparous population also occurs. The microclimate was characterized using temperature and relative humidity data loggers for a period of two years. We also measured the surface area and depth of the water bodies where we found S. algira larvae. Our results showed an autumn-winter reproductive period for all ovoviviparous populations studied . In most of the aquatic habitats examined, larvae appeared between November and March, although this period could extend to May at higher altitudes. Larval abundance and their size variability did not correlate with water body size or microclimate conditions. The decrease in the number of larvae per water body coincided with the existence of suitable conditions for post-metamorphic dispersal. Salamandra algira occurred in regions with moist conditions (annual average relative humidity greater than 64 %) and with mean annual temperatures of 13.6-18.6 °C, but populations were largely segregated along a gradient of humidity, with some showing higher and more constant values than others. The viviparous population occurs in a region with maritime influence and greater microclimate stability than the other sites studied.",

In tortoises, many studies have estimated individuals’ age by counting growth rings on their scutes, assuming one ring per year (1:1 ratio). However, the accuracy of this method is controversial. The ring deposition pattern can vary depending on species, or even populations, and should be studied comprehensively. We studied the ring deposition pattern of Testudo graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula, using recaptures of 156 individuals between 2004 and 2010. We used a novel approach to explore the ring deposition pattern and to test possible differences between localities and individuals. Our results revealed that most analysed individuals (57.4%) showed a 1:1 ratio, in which rings were deposited during months of activity (spring to autumn). However, we found a trend to count less rings than years, which underestimated 1 year every 3 or 4 years. No differences in the deposition patterns were found among sites, sizes or sexes because the halt in growth during hibernation equally affects all tortoises in all sites. Our results support that the assumed 1:1 ratio in the assignment of individuals’ age is too simplistic. Since ring deposition patterns are complex, the use of statistical approaches capable of handling deviations from the assumed deposition ratios can help to better depict population age structures.",

In addition, we propose a new classification scheme for their acoustic phenological strategies, based on the male’s calling records throughout an entire year. Also, we assessed the temporal and spectral niche overlap by the anuran species recorded. The assemblage was active throughout the entire year, with a higher concentration of calls recorded during the spring-summer season. We describe five distinct Acoustic Breeding Strategies based on the calling patterns of the recorded species. Temporal niche overlap was higher in the spring-summer season and in the lowest study site. The use of a PAM as a tool to monitor the advertisement calls in anurans communities could be a reliable technique to obtain different information about the species’ acoustic phenology and the temporal use of the acoustic communication channel.",

Of special concern are those regions with an exceptionally high salamander diversity such as Italy, where 19 salamander species are present most of which are strictly endemic. In this study, we update the information on the presence of Bsal in Italian wild salamanders, by adding samples from two presumptive outbreak sites, one on the island of Sardinia and one on continental Italy (Liguria). In addition, we reviewed the potential susceptibility of all the Italian salamander species on the basis of laboratory experimental infection trials, or from the tested susceptibility of the phylogenetically nearest species, according to the literature. Overall, 15 skin swabs from three species (Speleomantes sarrabusensis, Speleomantes strinatii and Salamandra salamandra) collected in the two presumptive Bsal outbreak sites were analysed by quantitative molecular methods, but none gave positive results. The majority of Italian salamander species and almost all of the endemic ones showed a high susceptibility to Bsal infection. Therefore, even if the presence of Bsal in Italian salamander populations has not been proven yet, the entire salamander fauna is highly threatened and preventive management actions should be taken. The need for strict biosecurity protocols on the international trade of captive or wild amphibians and for the implementation of preventive measures during field activities to limit the introduction and spread of the Bsal pathogen is again stressed.",

Spatial locations of road mortalities in both species reflected this with the median distances from the road edge greater in P. muralis. Temporal differences in road presence, based on mortality counts and those of live lizards, indicated significantly more lizards were present on roads during late summer and autumn, especially in P. muralis . A significant correlation was found between the monthly presence of live lizards and monthly road mortalities in P. muralis (r = 0.73) but not in L. bilineata (r = 0.64).  Numbers of L. bilineata found on roads bisecting low-density urban areas and roads bordered by hedgerows were higher than expected in relation to the occurrence of these habitats at roadsides. In P. muralis higher than expected numbers were found alongside low-density urban areas and roads bisecting woodland. Generally both species were less commonly seen on roads alongside agricultural areas with no hedgerow border.",

Density of railways in landscape, as well as traffic intensity, is usually much lower than in case of roads. As a consequence, their overall effect on amphibian populations is tacitly assumed to be less negative. To test whether very intensive rail traffic can cause substantial mortality in population of a small amphibian, we investigated a Smooth newt Lissotriton vulgaris population located in the city of Poznan, W Poland, where tram tracks border isolated breeding ponds. We performed controls during the peak of autumn migratory activity along the tracks. Less than 1% of all individuals found during the survey were killed by rail traffic. Observed mortality was very low despite large number of individuals present on the track and intensive tram traffic. As negative effects of traffic are low, rail or tram embankments can provide an important terrestrial habitat for small European newts.",

We here present a new non-invasive method that allows to estimate the body condition of the European cave salamanders (genus Speleomantes) using the tail area as a proxy, since these species usually accumulate fat tissue in their tail. We selected 915 high-quality images of individuals belonging to the eight Speleomantes species. Using the ImageJ program we calculated the tail measurements (length and area) from which we obtained the Fat Tail Index (FTI). The FTI was then correlated with the Scaled Mass Index (SMI) of individuals. We used GLMM to assess whether SMI is correlated to FTI, individual sex, species identity and the type of inhabited environment. We observed a significant correlation between SMI and FTI (R2 = 0.62). The GLMM analysis showed a significant effect on SMI due to sex, species and the type of environment. Females and individuals from surface environments showed the highest SMI. Among species, we observed a significant variability in their body condition and in the correlation between SMI and FTI. This study provided a reliable and non-invasive method that allows to estimate the body condition for terrestrial salamanders of the genus Speleomantes.",

Factors influencing HR size include sex, body size, and diet, with sex and body size being the most significant determinants. The Teratoscincus roborowskii, or Turpan Wonder Gecko, is endemic to the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang, northwestern China, yet its HR during the breeding period remains understudied. This research employed radio-tracking methods to evaluate the HR of T. roborowskii during the breeding season, focusing on influences from sex and body size. Our study involved radio telemetry of 11 individuals from June to July in 2020 and 2021. We quantified total and core HR sizes using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) methods. Results via MCP revealed total and core HR sizes of 7894.06±2672.87 m2 and 4852.41±2045.55 m2, respectively. Males exhibited larger HRs than females; however, the difference was not statistically significant (df=3, p=0.196, n=10). A significant correlation was found between snout-vent length (SVL) and HR size (v=55, p=0.002, n=10), indicating that lizards with larger SVLs occupied larger HRs, regardless of sex. Comparison with mark-recapture methods showed that HR sizes were 4-5 times larger when measured via radio-tracking. This study provides critical insights into the activity range and influencing factors of T. roborowskii during the breeding period, contributing essential data for its conservation efforts.",

We encountered several Kurixalus (Anura: Rhacophoridae) individuals of an unknown species identity in Fujian, China, a province with no previous records of Kurixalus. This genus of frogs, of which many new species have been described in recent years, has been the subject of much historical taxonomic confusion, largely due to conserved morphology. We sequenced two mitochondrial and one nuclear genes (1748 total bp) for three individuals from Fujian and reconstructed their phylogeny including all known lineages of Kurixalus from mainland China, and other East Asia lineages when data was available. Both Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood trees consistently showed that the individuals from Fujian were most closely related to K. inexpectatus, which previously was only known from northern Zhejiang, over 830 km north of this new location. Our results help clarify the identity of the unknown Kurixalus in Fujian and the distribution of Kurixalus, particularly regarding the distribution of K. hainanus, which has previously been confused with other members of the K. odontotarsus species complex. Additionally, we created ecological niche models using Maxent for the clade including both K. inexpectatus and its sister species K. idiootocus to guide future survey efforts.",

Using the stomach-flushing method, we analyzed stomach contents of 45 individuals (21 males and 24 females) from a total of 52 captured frogs because stomachs of six males and one female (13.5%) were empty. The food spectrum of M. menglienica comprises 12 types with a total of 691 prey items (687 invertebrate items and four unidentified items), belonging to six insect orders, larvae and Araneae. Similar to other species of the family Microhylidae, M. menglienica is also identified as an ant (Formicidae) – termite (Rhinotermitidae) eating specialist with distinctly higher percentages of occurrence frequency (F = 65 %), number of prey items (N = 80 %), and importance (Ix = 75 %) than those of remaining types. The Simpson diversity index of 0.939 shows a high abundance of food prey in the wild, and the Evenness index of 0.536 suggests biased consumption of feeding selection for M. menglienica.",

This research aims to fill this gap by using a recently introduced methodology for preparation with a few adjustments, and by describing female snake genitalia for seven previously undescribed species. The methodology is based on employing a two-component condensation silicone into snakes’ genitalia to create internal models for intersexual comparative morphology. We conducted a comprehensive examination of seven Old World snake species - Boidae: Eryx jaculus, Colubridae: Dolichophis caspius, Zamenis longissimus, Elaphe quatuorlineata, Coronella austriaca, and Viperidae: Vipera ammodytes, and V. berus. Our results reveal conspicuous variations in female genitalia morphology, speculating that there is also a significant variation in copulation adjustment between the different types of species’ genitalia.",

    "abstract": "An organism has the ability to evolve and produce different phenotypes in order to respond to local environmental conditions, which is a common adaptation strategy in nature. Besides biotic factors, abiotic factors such as the volume of water and the diversity of food in breeding ponds can also play significant roles in the survival and age at metamorphosis in amphibians. This study experimentally examined the plasticity in growth rate, survival rate, larval mass, age, and SVL at metamorphosis for Bufo gargarizans gargarizans. It specifically focused on different combinations of water volume and food diversity. An interaction between water volume and food diversity had no effect on larval growth and development. However, food diversity had a significant impact on the age at metamorphosis, revealing that the presence of two food resources resulted in a shorter larval period and earlier metamorphosis, particularly in larger water volumes. Our findings demonstrated that single tadpoles reared in larger water volumes had a larger body size at metamorphosis compared to those raised in smaller water volumes. Additionally, single tadpoles raised in larger water volumes exhibited higher growth rates and a shorter larval period than those raised in smaller water volumes. We propose that the increased frequency of physical encounters between tadpoles and vessel walls in smaller volumes leads to stress from crowding or psychological factors, which is the primary factor in hindering larval growth and development.",

Além disso, o esforço reprodutivo feminino na Caatinga deve ser mais qualitativo do que quantitativo, com ninhadas menores, mas com ovócitos maiores. Nas comparações intraespecíficas, usamos variáveis ​​morfométricas e estimamos o número e o volume individual de ovócitos.

Em ambientes úmidos, o período reprodutivo mais prolongado e o comprometimento energético com diversas necessidades podem comprometer o crescimento e gerar custos tão altos quanto os do ambiente semiárido, equalizando os padrões corporais. Apenas L. macrosternum apoiou nossa segunda previsão, com menor número de ovócitos na Caatinga, mas sem maior volume. Não temos certeza de quais fatores influenciaram esse tamanho de oócito, mas eles provavelmente agem cumulativamente para evitar gasto desnecessário de energia, resultando em uma estratégia qualitativa.

Saving local populations needs active species protection measures. Previous studies showed E. orbicularis individuals are vulnerable in all stages of life, but the most exposed are early life stages: incubation of eggs and first overwintering of hatchlings. The aim of this study was to compare hatching success of naturally vs artificially incubated E. orbicularis eggs and further artificially reared hatchlings survival during their first year. Furthermore, a perennial detail description of the main nesting measurements (clutch size, depth) was provided from the small E. orbicularis populations in its northern distribution range, Lithuania. Finally, a detail description of approved artificial egg incubation and further hatchlings rearing methodology is provided. The provided methodologies for artificial E. orbicularis incubation and further rearing may be used to preserve and increase the size of local small E. orbicularis populations in its northern distribution range.",

For example, rattlesnakes using the ambush strategy rely on chemical cues to locate an ambush station, then visual and thermal cues to initiate envenomating strikes, then chemical cues again to track prey. By contrast, many natricine snakes use chemical cues to initiate predation, increasing the rate of tongue flicking regardless of whether visual cues are present. The present study examined the individual and interactive effects of chemical and visual stimuli of prey on the predatory behavior of five snake taxa representing three feeding guilds. Bull snakes ( Pituophis catenifer ), Eastern Corn snakes ( Pantherophis guttatus ), and Midland Rat snakes ( Scotophis spiloides ) have a diet primarily consisting of mammals; Western Fox snakes ( Mintonius vulpina ) prey primarily on bird eggs; and Common Kingsnakes ( Lampropeltis getula ) prey equally on mammals and reptiles. Three patterns of response to chemical and visual stimuli of the test prey ( Mus musculus ) were observed. Mammal specialists responded to chemical cues. Fox snakes responded to visual cues, but not to chemical cues. Kingsnakes exhibited increased rates of tongue flicking in response to both chemical and visual stimuli. This study suggests correlations between the evolution of prey preference, foraging ecology and the utilization of chemical or visual stimuli by snakes.",

    "abstract": "Bone histology is an important tool for the interpretation of life patterns in animals of the past and extant fauna. The crocodylians have been studied as important inferential models for morphophysiological characteristics. We aimed to characterize the osteohistology of captive Caiman latirostris, identifying its microanatomy related to growth rates, ontogeny, and environmental conditions. We analyzed five pairs of humeri (proximal elements of the appendicular skeleton) and ribs (axial skeleton) of females’ caiman. Ribs showed, in general, woven-fibered tissues, with low vascularization and parallel-fibered bone and many resorption and erosion cavities. It presented lines of arrested growth (LAGs) in three individuals, without skeletochronological compatibility. Humeri showed a gradient of woven-fibered to parallel-fibered and lamellar-zonal bone as the individuals aging. We observed compacted coarse cancellous bone (CCCB) and a higher number of LAGs in older specimens. Ribs remodel faster than humerus, showing an intra-individual histovariability. The humeri indicated an evident growth pattern with different ontogeny stages and growth rates in different ages. Fast-growing tissues are uncommon in crocodylians, but basal metabolism and optimal growth conditions can lead to this. Bone histology of C. latirostris shows patterns that can be used as inferential models for extant and extinct groups, but we encourage further studies for a better understanding, under different environmental conditions, such as temperature and food availability.",

Survival of the turtle populations in suboptimal conditions depends heavily on longevity, regular annual breeding and relatively large clutch sizes, but additional unnatural mortality could alter their survival rates. Loss of only single turtle in majority of northern populations could mean a loss of 3-20% of subpopulation. But due to comparative rarity of the road accidents the effects of individual road mortality to the turtle populations might not be recognized. We discuss possible effects of road–associated mortality, and suggest that precautionary measures as setting of the buffer zones with low road density and possibility of lowering of traffic volume must be considered during the planning of the species conservation actions.",

The southern smooth snake ( Coronella girondica ) is likely the most elusive snake species of peninsular Italy, and is therefore well-suited for predicting potential distribution studies. In this paper we predict the potential distribution map of this species in Italy by using MAXENT algorithm, that finds the probability distribution of maximum entropy that is constrained by considered ecological parameters. Presence data for Coronella girondica were gotten from CKmap. The potential distribution model of Coronella girondica showed a very good overall performance (AUC = 0.959), and indicated that high suitability areas correspond mainly to Tyrrhenian north and central regions, including Liguria, western Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, and northern Latium. Southern Italian regions were clearly unsuitable for this snake species. Overall, our study revealed that previous distribution maps indicating the occurrence of Coronella girondica in southern Italy and Sicily were poorly reliable. The conservation and management implications of our study are also addressed.",

This gap of knowledge is worthy of attention, since Sardinia hosts a rich herpetofauna with a large proportion of endemic species, and distribution data are crucial for targeting conservation efforts. In this paper we provide new distribution data for Sardinian reptiles, with the aim of updating our knowledge on their specific distribution. Data were opportunistically recorded during ten years of field research in Sardinia, carried out in more than twenty campaigns from April 1999 to June 2009. All the eighteen reptile species belonging to the Sardinian fauna were recorded. A total amount of 293 faunistic data were collected from 178 different localities covering the entire study area. Within this dataset, 137 faunistic data fall outside known species’ ranges as reported in the Atlas of Italian amphibians and reptiles. In conclusion, data presented here produced a remarkable increase of knowledge on Sardinian reptiles distribution compare to that reported in the last available syntheses. Nevertheless, it should be evidenced that, notwithstanding the present updating, the knowledge of Sardinian reptiles’ distribution is probably still far from being exhaustive. Thus, further investigations are strongly required for obtaining a complete picture and identifying conservation priorities in terms of isolated species/populations and areas of high diversity and endemicity.",

The control group was reared in unchanging water levels. The tadpoles experiencing desiccation threat reached MC earlier than those reared in constant water levels and metamorphosed (Gosner stage 46) at smaller body sizes. Time to reach MC was comparable between the groups of tadpoles experiencing a gradual or rapid decrease in water levels but their size at the completion of metamorphosis varied. They emerged at a significantly smaller size under rapid desiccation threat compared to the gradual desiccation threat. Impact on size at emergence was in proportion to the level of desiccation threat and this accelerated development and led to an early metamorphosis.

The design included predator-naive or predator experienced prey subjects, and presence or absence of a natural shelter. Water scorpion adult individuals ( Laccotrephes species) provided predation threat and also an opportunity to the prey to experience a direct danger of predation. Both previous experience with predators and availability of shelters affected larval survival independently and not conjointly. A prior encounter with predators enabled prey tadpoles to escape predation more effectively with a significant increase in their survival in comparison to the predator-naive subjects. Similarly, access to refuge sites significantly increased survival of predator-naive as well as predator experienced tadpoles compared to that in the absence of shelters. Clearly, ability to sense water borne predacious cues in the vicinity and use refuge sites plays a key role in escaping from predation in the bronze frog tadpoles.",

The species exhibits high levels of polymorphism, especially in colouration and pattern. Recent studies revealed significant morphological differences between the two subspecies from northeastern and western portions of Iran. However, considering limited geographic samplings, taxonomic status of Iranian Macrovipera are controversial. In this study, uni- and multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze geographic variation in 31 morphological characters measured in 117 specimens of Macrovipera lebetina covering its entire range in Iran. Sexual dimorphism was obvious in number of scales across the head and subcaudals. Univariate analyses detected substantial geographic variation in several meristic characters. Pholidosis exhibits a general north-south pattern of variation and most scale counts averaged higher in southern regions. Colouration displayed a pattern of strong clinal variation among three broad areas consisting of the combined western and northwestern, northeastern, and southern highland regions. Also, morphometric characters exhibited a general north-south pattern of geographic variation and some characters averaged lower in southern regions. Populations from the southern regions remained clearly distinct in Principal Component, Cluster and Discriminant analyses. In the light of these differences, it is concluded that the southern Iranian populations should not be identified as belonging to Macrovipera lebetina obtusa (Dwigubsky, 1832), which occurs in northwestern and western regions of the Iranian Plateau.",

In this study we examined habitat use by the spadefoot toads in north-west Italy, where one of the largest remaining populations lives. We used compositional analysis and logistic regression models to elaborate land-use and soil composition in order to determine the habitat preferences of the spadefoot toads. We found that the two main variables predicting the occurrence of spadefoot toads in the study area were the percentages of sandy-loam soil texture and the presence of Entisols. Our results showed that spadefoot toads preferred soils that keep soft and malleable structure: Entisols with sand texture, where sand represents the major component, and mature soils, with a high degree of pedogenesis and a relatively high natural fertility and humidity. Conversely, Pelobates fuscus avoids Inceptisols, probably too hard to be dug by the species. This study demonstrates that, at least in the Italian range, the choice of areas in which to reintroduce P. fuscus , or where re-create favourable habitats for it, must take into account the soil types, which, in intensely cultivated areas, seems to be decisive for the possibility of survival of the species in the medium and long time.",

We compared head shape of 54 specimens belonging to three out of the four clades ( M. insignitus insignitus , M. i. fuscus , and M. monspessulanus monspessulanus ) by means of geometric morphometrics. We found a significant differentiation: the supraocular and frontal area showed the largest amount of variation, being respectively much thinner in M. i. insignitus , a bit less thin in M. i. fuscus and definitely wider in M. m. monspessulanus . Our findings are fully in agreement with the genetic studies and phylogeny explains more than 20% of the observed variation, supporting the taxonomic distinction inside the genus Malpolon . The functional and/or adaptive meaning of the observed differences is not clear, but it seems unlikely that it may be related to diet. Combining morphological data with phylogeography and environmental features, we formulated an explanatory hypothesis that allowed a precise and testable prediction.",

    "abstract": "Copulatory organs are a key trait in reproductive compatibility and sexual isolation. The role of male genitalia in boosting mating success is well known and is often the outcome of behavioural and biological constraints, although no clear and common interpretation about their evolution appears broadly applicable. In snakes, hemipenial morphology has often been described under the perspective of sexual selection, taking into consideration both behavioural and morphological traits of both sexes. We investigated hemipenial morphology and ornamentation in the two subspecies of Hierophis viridiflavus, a male-male combating colubrid, and compared it to the sister species H. gemonensis, to assess intraspecific variation in size of genitalia and ornamentation richness. The male intromitted organ of this species is unilobed and bulbous, with rich ornamentations consisting of basal spines and apical calyculations. We detected no statistically significant difference in hemipenial size, basal spine count, and spine length between the two subspecies, suggesting that no copulatory barrier is present between the two clades. Although hemipenial morphology and anatomy do not seem suitable to assess intraspecific variability as shown in this study, they are often highly variable at the family or genus level, suggesting that the evolution of male genitalia is linked to phylogenetic relationships and that hemipenial divergence might be correlated to lineage splitting despite not being necessarily the main cause. Future studies should be aimed at investigating hemipenial morphology and anatomy across species under the perspective of comparative phylogeny and reproductive behaviours to address thoroughly the constraints of hemipenial evolution and development.",

According to the thermal melanism hypothesis, melanistic phenotypes should provide thermal advantages, thus positively impacting various biological aspects of these individuals. Nevertheless, these benefits seem to be countered by environmental constraints and predatory pressure. Here, we mapped for the first time the distribution of the melanistic phenotypes in the highly polymorphic asp viper (Vipera aspis). We focused our research effort on the Italian peninsula, where this species reaches its highest level of taxonomic diversity with three currently described subspecies. Furthermore, we investigated via bioclimatic niche modelling, the influence of a wide array of bioclimatic variables on the distribution of melanism in Italian asp vipers. In general, our results seem to support the implications of the thermal melanism hypothesis, highlighting the central influence of mean annual temperature and elevation on the geographic distribution of melanistic V. aspis. At the finest scale, our analyses have highlighted a distinction in bioclimatic niches among the three assessed subspecies. However, further fine-scale investigations are needed in order to exclude the potential influence of latitude and elevation on the observed the intersubspecific bioclimatic niche segregation pattern.",

In particular, for five Italian salamander species, risk categories were elevated significantly based on Criterion E, from Vulnerable or lower to Endangered or Critically Endangered. This increased reliance on Criterion E raises concerns regarding its treatment of uncertainty, as these projections depend heavily on assumptions about Bsal spread, environmental suitability, and host dynamics.

Here, the authors hypothesise about times and modes of colonization and discuss the faunistic value of the obtained results. This follows the recent proposal to consider the two clades as two different species. Specimens from the islands of Favignana, Lipari and Vulcano belong to H. carbonarius and probably all belong to putative Sicilian source populations. Conversely, all individuals from the Pontine Islands (Ponza, Palmarola, Ventotene) should be considered to belong to H. viridiflavus . Even if genetically identical to the specimens from the Tyrrhenian Italian coast, these individuals show a darker colouration, very similar to the one usually shown by H. carbonarius specimens. Considering that the Pontine H. viridiflavus populations probably have a very recent origin, the dark livery of these individuals could be the result of a rapid morphological adaptation to insular environments.",

We used in vitro phytohaemoagglutinin (PHA) stimulation in order to assess the effects of temperature on cell mediated adaptive response in male and female Common wall lizards ( Podarcis muralis ). Cell cultures were prepared from blood samples, inoculated with PHA and incubated at 22°C, 25°C, 32°C, and 38°C for three days. PHA stimulation caused proliferation of T-lymphocytes, but the effect depended on the incubation temperature. Lymphocyte proliferation was significantly impaired at both 22°C and 38°C compared to 32°C, which represented the highest levels of activation. Furthermore, lymphocyte activation was more variable in males while females were less immune suppressed than males at low temperatures. Differences between sexes suggest a possible influence of steroid hormones.",

Recent phylogenetic studies suggested that this genus displayed cryptic diversity and was divided into five species: A. anatolica, A. pelasgiana, A. ibrahimi, A. finikensis and A. danfordi. The ecological niche differentiations of these species have not been studied so far. Our aims for this study were to predict the potential suitable habitats for the species nested in genus Anatololacerta, and to examine the niche overlaps and differentiations via identity and background tests. The occurrence data were obtained from literature and our own field surveys. Occurrence records were rarefied and assessed in a 30 arc-second resolution layer, compatible with several bioclimatic and topographic variables. Species distribution analyses were performed using maximum entropy approach and pairwise niche comparisons were evaluated by identity and background tests. Our results demonstrated that the species delimitation among this genus was not only affected by geographic isolation but also that precipitation and temperature influenced the habitat suitability for these species. Predicted suitability usually well matched the actual species distributions. Moreover, the niche overlap (identity test) analyses verified that allopatric Anatololacerta species show clear ecological differentiations. However, a niche overlap between parapatric species A. pelasgiana and A. finikensis, was confirmed by identity and background tests. It has been suggested that these parapatric species could be more affected by microclimatological parameters than the others. The results of our study are in agreement with the latest phylogenetic study within this genus.",

The ascomycete Ophidiomyces ophidiicola (Oo) is the causative agent of ophidiomycosis, an emerging disease with sublethal effects. Skin lesions, such as dysecdysis, edematous, crusty or necrotic scales, swellings, nodules, and ulcers, are the most common clinical manifestation of the disease. The pathogen and its associated disease are well characterized in wild snakes in North America, whereas broad screenings of free ranging wild ophidians in Europe are rare. In 2019, as part of a multi-year snake health monitoring project, all the Cocullo ophidians were carefully examined for integumentary affections and those showing signs consistent with ophidiomycosis were dry swabbed on the skin and on any visible cutaneous lesions with a single applicator. The extracted DNA underwent a broad-range panfungal PCR targeting the D1-D2 region, as well as two conventional PCRs specific to the ITS2 and IGS regions of Oo DNA. Twenty-three out of 129 snakes (13/82 Elaphe quatuorlineata; 7/31 Hierophis viridiflavus; 3/15 Zamenis longissumus; 0/1 Natrix helvetica) resulted clinically affected, but no specific Oo genomic DNA was detected by PCR. The Cocullo ritual celebration provided a unique opportunity for the first systematic testing of a large sample size of a local snake community for the monitoring of this pathogen in Italy.",

    "abstract": "A series of 59 transect surveys was conducted in selected wet forest habitats, along the coast of West Africa, to estimate the density distribution of African Hinge-back tortoises (Kinixys homeana and K. erosa). Line transect data were fed into a simple model to derive a detection function. The parameters estimated by the model produced an elaborate characterisation of tortoise distribution, which proved to be useful in the formulation of hypotheses about tortoise densities. Line transect data were analysed by DISTANCE, with a series of key and the series adjustment: the uniform function, the 1-parameter half-normal function, and the 2-parameter hazard-rate function were considered as key functions; the cosine series, simple polynomials, and Hermite polynomials were considered as series expansions. The detection function was estimated separately for Kinixys homeana and K. erosa, and for transects grouped for each study area by considering all the combinations of the above key functions and series expansions. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was computed for each candidate model and used for model selection. The best model of the detection function, for both the tortoise species was the uniform function with no series expansion. Model results indicated that the density of the two species was inversely related at the local scale, and complementary across the region; such that the density of one species increases from West to East while the other one declines. Overall, the comparison of density estimates between the two tortoises is consistent with a former hypothesis suggesting inter-specific competition and consequent resource partitioning. Other causes may contribute to explain the observed patterns, including the low productivity of rainforest habitats and long-term human perturbation.",

I approached frogs from the front (cranial), back (caudal), and side (lateral) simulating an attacking predator. On average, frogs jumped away at 135.73° (SE = 2.31°) from the direction of attack. I did not distinguish between right and left directions in this study. There were significant differences in the angle of escape among the three attack directions (F 2,87 = 17.64, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in escape angle between frogs that I approached from the front (mean = 130.4°, SE = 2.59°) or the side (mean = 126.3°, SE = 3.75°, Tukey interval: -0.261, 0.626). The angle of escape was not uniform and directional escape was around 120° across all tests. Frontal and side approaches led to escape angles near 120° but attacks from the rear resulted in two modes of escape, at about 180° and 120° from the angle of approach. These frogs have a possible blind spot in the rear of their field of vision that might explain this bimodal escape pattern in rear attacks. The tendency to jump away at an angle rather than strait away from the predator likely represents as an evolutionary compromise between an attempt to maximize angular and linear displacement from the attacking predator. This optimal strategy may demonstrate a fitness and survival advantage.",

Extensive data collection was conducted in Hungary in 2009-2015 from fourteen different areas. Combined data – recent field sampling on sixteen taxa and the examination of archived Bombina spp. specimens – from 1360 individuals were analysed with qPCR. Two sentinel taxa, Bombina variegata and the members of the Pelophylax esculentus complex were marked to monitor the occurrence of Bd in two core areas (Bakony Mts and Hortobagy National Park, respectively) of sampling. Climatic variables were also examined in core areas to test their effect on prevalence and infection intensity. Among the sixteen sampled amphibian taxa seven tested positive for Bd and the overall prevalence in Hungary was 7.46%. Among the ethanol-fixed Bombina spp. individuals Bd was not detected. In the first core area (Bakony Mts) the overall prevalence in B. variegata was 10.32% and juvenile individuals showed significantly higher prevalence than adults. On the other hand there was a significant negative relationship between infection prevalence and monthly mean air temperature. Finally, in the other core area (Hortobagy National Park) the overall prevalence in P. esculentus complex was 13.00%, and no differences were found in prevalence or infection intensity between sexes, sampling years or age classes.",

Features of cutaneous glands involved in this bulk discharge were observed under light and electron microscopes. Furthermore, restoration of depleted glands was followed after 1, 2 and 3 weeks, and compared with serous biosynthesis during larval gland development. Bulk discharge was caused by contraction of myoepithelial cells (mecs) encircling the secretory units. Mec compression dramatically affected the secretory unit, but parts of this syncytial cytoplasm were saved from degeneration and cooperated in gland renewal with stem cells from the gland neck. These adenoblasts underwent proliferation and secretory cytodifferentiation, until merging with the syncytium. Cytoplasm that had resumed secretory activity showed the features typical of larval gland development: the endoplasmic reticulum (rer) cisterns were aligned in close parallel arrangement and Golgi stacks released minute type I granules. Secretory rehabilitation led to increasing amounts of granule content. In the meantime, rough cisterns decreased in number and assumed the less ordered pattern described in control specimens. Data collected in the present study revealed that chemical skin defence in anurans is a multi-factorial mechanism involving specific activities: mechanical from mecs, biosynthetic from secretory syncytium and proliferative from intercalated stem cells.",

In this study we describe the advertisement and release calls from a redbelly toad population from the central Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, based on recordings obtained during the winter season of 2011. The advertisement call consists of a complex call with two segments, the first segment comprising a series of single, unpulsed notes, and the second comprising a multi-pulsed note (a trill) highly variable in duration. The mean dominant frequency of the call is 2668 ± 154 Hz (2261–2932 Hz) and mean call duration is 37.07 ± 23.97 s (6.64–75.20 s). This feature, however, is highly variable depending on the duration of the second segment, which may be notably longer compared to calls of other species of the genus Melanophryniscus . The release call was recorded during amplexus of up to four individuals. It consists of a short trill with a dominant frequency of approximately 2245 Hz, emitted as a series of five to six pulsed notes, each comprising five or six pulses. The advertisement call of Melanophryniscus pachyrhynus is compared with those of four other Melanophryniscus species, and the similarities in habitat requirements and in the temporal pattern of reproduction for species of the M. tumifrons group are discussed .",

    "abstract": "In this study, the age structure and some life history traits were revealed for the first time in a population of Ommatotriton vittatus , living in Tarsus (mid-south part of Turkey), at the western limit of the species’ range. Maximum longevity was recorded to be eight years in both females and males and age at maturity was estimated as three years for males and four years for females. Although mean age did not differ significantly between sexes, males had significantly larger snout-vent length (SVL) than females. Age and body size were positively correlated with each other for both females and males. Since the populations of the Southern Banded Newt in Turkey are in decline, the present study that provides preliminary data on life history traits of this newt could be helpful for future biological studies.",

To date, this hypothesis has mainly been tested in homoeothermic animals and in some ectothermic animals (e.g., fishes and anurans). Here, we undertake a test of the ETH by analyzing the relationship between brain size variation and length of the digestive tract in Hylarana guentheri . After controlling for geographical situation and body size, we did not find a correlation between brain mass and the length of the digestive tract in H. guentheri . Our findings suggest that the variation of brain size did not follow general patterns in this species and that the effect of diet quality cannot play a role in the variation of brain.",

Among them, an important fungal disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ). With an aquatic infectious phase,  Bd  does not survive desiccation for long, but may be transported by non-amphibian carriers. Such mechanism is key to understand amphibian-chytrid dynamics and may contribute to local amphibian conservation action plans. Therefore, we surveyed Bd in reptiles from two different Brazilian rainforests, looking for possible Bd carriers. We sampled 35 individuals belonging to 11 squamate families, five from the Atlantic Forest and 30 from the Amazon. We detected Bd in one adult lizard, Placosoma glabellum . This lizard feeds, shelters, and breeds in the leaf-litter, and moves between Atlantic Forest streams. Hence, it may be carrying Bd from stream to stream, and also spreading the pathogen to direct-developing amphibians, which have no contact with water bodies and are more susceptible to chytridiomycosis than aquatic species. This is the first record of a non-amphibian chytrid carrier in South America. We suggest that additional field and museum samplings will contribute to understand whether Bd can actually infect reptiles, and how reptile carriers can affect chytrid dynamics in the wild.",

In low-dose group, some seminiferous tubules lost their regular shape. Also, the enlargement of interstitial spaces among tubules and germ cell necrosis were determined. A weak hemorrhage was observed among some tubules. In medium-dose group, germ cell necrosis was detected in many seminiferous tubules. This time, a weak hemorrhage was detected within tubules. In the high dose group, an increase in the number of disorganized tubules were observed. Vacuolization and necrosis in germ cells of seminiferous tubules were frequently seen. According to these findings, carbaryl caused dose-related histopathological damage in testis of B. variabilis .

To compare digital image results we also used anatomical topography of autopsied females. Although reproductive females were significantly longer in one locality and larger in the second one, clutch size did not differ between localities. Two main clutches were produced during a year, with occasionally a third one. Shelled eggs were frequent in May, June and July, while follicula were present till August, with a decrease in follicular size especially in July and August. Despite the presence of a number of follicles in late summer and in autumn, a third expected clutch was only an exceptional event, differently from what happens in other sites of the species’ distribution range. The permanence of follicles after the last deposition is interpreted as a possible extra energy source during the very hot and dry summers of coastal central Italy and for the hibernating phase.",

From our study we detected only limited morphometric variation between species. We distinguish the new species using genetics, combined with assessment of morphological features, and their geographical distribution. We highlight the threats to pygmy chameleons in East Africa from habitat change and exporting live specimens for the wildlife trade. Based on our understanding, we note a few species that we consider at risk of decline – mainly based on their narrow distribution and their apparent popularity in the export market. This study also further underlines the extraordinary biological value of the relatively small forest patches (less than 3000 km2) of the Eastern Arc, which contain more species of chameleons than any other area in mainland Africa.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, many reptile species have been introduced outside their native ranges, either accidentally through the transportation of goods and materials (e.g., plants, construction materials), but also intentionally through the pet trade. As a paradigmatic example, the Italian wall lizard, Podarcis siculus, native to the Italian Peninsula, Sicily and the north Adriatic coast, has been introduced in several nearby islands since historical times (Corsica, Sardinia, Menorca). Besides these regions, scattered populations were later reported from the Iberian Peninsula, France, Switzerland, Turkey, Greece, the United Kingdom and North America. Here, we provide molecular evidence regarding the introduction and origin of P. siculus in six new populations outside its native range: Romania (Bucharest and Alba Iulia), inland Croatia (Zagreb and Karlovac), Italy (Lampedusa Island) and Azerbaijan (Baku). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Alba Iulia (Romania) population originated from a single clade (Tuscany), while the population from Azerbaijan is admixed including two distinct clades, one similar to those found in Sicily and the other present across the Tuscany clade. Samples from Bucharest also have admixed origins in Tuscany and the Adriatic clades. Less surprisingly, samples from Zagreb and Karlovac are included in the Adriatic clade while those from Lampedusa originated from Sicily. Overall, our results further demonstrate that P. siculus is able to establish outside of its native range even under different climatic conditions, not particularly from specific clades or source areas. Also, for the first time in this species, our results indicate that repeated human introductions promote lineage admixture and enhance their invasive potential.",

In this study, we provide new information on the distribution and ecology of amphibians and reptiles in the “Cilento, Vallo di Diano e Alburni” (CVDA) National Park in southern Italy. We used a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2465 records obtained from fieldwork, citizen science, and literature to evaluate species’ rarity, habitat preferences and community assemblage. We investigated whether differences in species richness across different habitat types and elevations resulted from species selection of different environmental conditions. We quantified species probability of observation in different habitat types and estimated the significance of species-habitat associations. Species rarity was assessed by considering geographic range, population abundance, and habitat breadth. Collected data substantially improved knowledge of the distribution of numerous species compared to published data. Our findings are generally consistent with the species’ ecological information available in Italy, but we also found some species’ peculiar ecological aspects that are little-known. The CVDA National Park emerges as an effective protected area that ensures good conservation status of the herpetofauna, also in the case of species showing population and range declines at the national scale.",

We present the details of the marking procedure and examine the benefits and drawbacks of the technique considering the fossorial environment. After marking many individuals in a long-term field study, we can ensure that the marks were easily applicable and were not lost over a period of at least four years.

In this study, the reproductive cycle of this species was studied by focusing on oogenesis, from April 5 to October 20, 2011. In total, 70 adult females were obtained from Mazandaran, one of the northern provinces of Iran where the climate is temperate. Ovaries were removed and processed for histological and morphometric studies. The results show that oocyte growth starts in late April and ends in August. Mating starts in spring, especially at the beginning of May, with oviposition occurring from late May to mid August. Females lay 1-2 eggs per clutch with the possibility of producing a secondary clutch later in the season. Maximum reproductive activity occurs in May and peaks in June. There was no significant difference between right and left side of reproductive system. With oogenesis occurring from April through July, C. caspium follows an oogenic cycle typical for temperate species.",

    "abstract": "In male-larger species of animals, males typically continue to grow after the age of female sexual maturation has been reached. Consequently, a switch of energy allocation occurs as the female investment from growth is shifted into egg production. We focus on the transitional period when both sexes heavily invest into anabolic processes; males invest in the development of body tissues while females predominantly invest in egg production. In captive mangrove- dwelling monitor lizards, we found that relative food intakes as well as quantitative estimates of anabolic processes (relative growth and egg production rates) are fairly comparable between the sexes. In spite of this biochemical clini- cal values and body condition indices revealed sex differences suggesting costs of reproduction in females. These results clearly illustrate that growth and egg production still substantially differ in associated physiological costs. This may be attributed to qualitative requirements (nutrients, minerals, etc.) of these processes. Our results correspond well with the higher susceptibility and mortality rates of females than males in many lizard species in captivity.",

Three surveys were conducted in December 2007, December 2009 and April 2010 aimed at generat- ing a comprehensive list of the forest amphibians and reptiles. Using largely timed- species count method, 13 species of amphibians representing eight families and 32 reptiles belonging to 11 families were recorded. Overall species diversity was highest during the 2007 sampling. The richness and abundance of amphibians was highest during the April 2010 sampling period when the amount of rainfall was also high- est. The results of species accumulation curves of the three sampling periods did not plateau demonstrating that more species occur in this forest. Pressure on this for - est fragment from the adjacent local people is high which in addition to the annual floods threatens its long-term survival. For example the distribution and abundance of some forest associated species such as the tree frogs Leptopelis flavomaculatus and Hyperolius puncticulatus appear to fluctuate with flood events and may decline in future. Considering the forest associated herpetofanua recorded, Kitobo forest is zoo- geographically assignable to the East African coastal forest biodiversity hotspot. The documentation of high species richness and diversity in this small forest fragment strongly highlight its biodiversity importance and place it among the most important sites for the conservation of reptiles and amphibians in Kenya.",

While most species of turtle exhibit secondary sexual dimorphisms that can be used to reliably infer sex, there are some species that are very difficult to sex, and even within many dimorphic species, it is not uncommon to encounter individuals that appear to exhibit both male and female secondary sex characteristics. Therefore, we tested the novel method of using a vibrator to sex turtles by stimulating male turtles to evert their penises. We tested this method on males of four species (three families) with known sexual dimorphisms: spiny softshell turtles ( Apalone spinifera ; n = 14), western chicken turtles ( Deirochelys reticularia miaria ; n = 17), Mississippi mud turtles ( Kinosternon subrubrum hippocrepis ; n = 10), and common musk turtles ( Sternotherus odoratus ; n = 9). The method accurately sexed 100% of A. spinifera, 64.7% of D. r. miaria , 80.0% of K. s. hippocrepis , and 55.6% of S. odoratus. Despite the low success rates in some species, there are situations in which this method will be useful for researchers working with species that are difficult to sex using external morphological characteristics.",

Additionally, we also performed a GMYC analysis of molecular assignment that recovered the haplotypes of I. abdita from its type locality and from the new record (Alto Caparao) under the same taxonomical entity. Our bioacoustical analysis revealed two distinct types of calls, herein referred as A and B calls. The A call was observed in both populations, whereas the B call was only recorded at Alto Caparao. Despite the apparent similarity in the A calls from both localities, we observed differences in all traits analyzed. Moreover, each call trait expressed variation within males. The peak frequency never exceeded 5% variation and it was classified as static in both populations. Temporal parameters, such as call duration and interval between calls were classified either as dynamic or intermediate, with variations ranging from 1.8-66.1% within males.

    "abstract": "The gecko Mediodactylus kotschyi is considered rare in mainland Greece, yet it is very abundant on the Aegean islands. It has been thought to be saxicolous throughout much of its range. In a recent survey on the Peloponnese peninsula, however, we encountered it mainly on trees, and with higher frequency than previously reported. We combined our observations of localities in which we detected this gecko, and places where we failed to detect it, with data about its occurrence from the literature and museum collections. We posited two hypotheses as possible causes for the apparent relative scarcity of M. kotschyi in the Peloponnese: that it is associated with low precipitation and that it has an aversion to limestone rock. We predicted that M. kotschyi would be more likely to be found in arid places and where limestone is not the dominant type of rock, since it has been reported that this substrate is less suitable for this species. Moreover, we predicted that geckos occurring in limestone regions would be found on trees rather than under rocks. Geckos were indeed found mainly in the more arid parts of the Peloponnese, but not exclusively so. We found no evidence of limestone avoidance. We suggest that, because M. kotschyi is better known as being mostly saxicolous over most of its range, and exclusively so on the Greek islands, in the Peloponnese the search for this species has been restricted to a single habitat type, i.e. under rocks and not on trees. It may thus inhabit more localities in the Peloponnese and be more abundant there than has previously been thought.",

The developing eggs were opened at 0 (freshly laid), 10, 20, 30, 35, 38, and 40 days of incubation and at hatching (day 41) and subjected to chemical and structural analyses. The oval and flexible-shelled eggs had undergone significant changes in size (40% increase in length, 68% increase in breadth and 315% increase in weight) from laying to hatching. The fresh eggshell contained 2.76 mg (12.51%) calcium whereas the hatched eggshell had only 1.02 mg (7.20%), or a 63% reduction from its original content. The yolk + fluids fraction provides only 0.47 mg to the 1.76 mg of calcium in the hatchling, the rest being resorbed from the eggshell during development. The fresh eggshell (62 µm thick) had a rough granular structure in its calcareous layer with near uniform rectangular/polygonal fields made up of globules of varying sizes. The membrane layer had a multilayered mat of interwoven, irregularly oriented and bifurcated, fibres of uneven thickness. The spherical globules were absent at several places in the hatched eggshell as a result of eggshell calcium utilisation by the developing embryo. Hence, like that of most reptiles, the eggshell of Psammophilus blanfordanus also acts as a secondary source of calcium for the developing embryo. The embryo utilizes the eggshell calcium towards the end of development.",

    "abstract": "Despite the abundant data on habitat use of Vipera ammodytes, most studies are purely descriptive, merely listing the habitats in which the species is most often found. More complete studies evaluating the habitat preference of the species are lacking. The intraspecific variation (i.e., interpopulation or seasonal) in habitat and microhabitat utilization of the species also remains a poorly studied topic. In the current study, we assessed the general patterns of habitat and microhabitat use of V. ammodytes and their interpopulation and seasonal variations, based on habitat/microhabitat availability. To achieve that, we studied five different populations along a latitudinal gradient in western Bulgaria. In all of the studied areas, V. ammodytes showed a clear preference for various stony and rocky habitats and microhabitats, overgrown with herbaceous and shrub vegetation, while it avoided bare habitats, dark deciduous forests as well as cultivated agricultural lands. There were clear interpopulation and seasonal variations in habitat and microhabitat preference and spatial niche utilization. Our results suggest that habitat and microhabitat use of V. ammodytes depends on a combination of many factors such as season, locally specific characteristics like habitat structure and availability, population dynamics, food availability, physical and microclimatic conditions, and possibly on the extent of the interspecific competition",

The different types of land use were determined together with the presence/absence, abundance and size class of the different reptile species. The results showed that areas with high anthropic pressure had a lower diversity of species, as well as a less balanced community structure, that could put at risk the effective recruitment and hence the maintenance of the reptile populations in these areas. The reasons behind the decline in the reptile community are similar to those put forward for explaining the decline in amphibians in the same area.",

    "abstract": "Aposematism is a visual communication system in which bright and contrasted coloured prey warn predators about their unprofitability. The Northern Spectacled Salamander Salamandrina perspicillata, a small terrestrial salamander endemic to Italy, displays a uniform dark dorsal colouration and a contrasted ventral side in which a bright red colour is displayed by coiling the tail over the body. In amphibians, this behaviour, known as “Unkenreflex”, is usually considered to be aposematic. In this study, we used realistic plasticine replicas to test this aposematic hypothesis in the Northern Spectacled Salamander. Of the 199 clay models placed in a natural habitat, 165 (83%) were recovered and 39 (24%) showed some sign of predation. The head of the models was more attacked than expected by chance (P = 0.042), suggesting that potential predators were perceiving models as real prey. However, there were no differences in the proportion of dorsal (18/83 = 22%), and ventral (21/82 = 26%) models attacked by predators. Therefore, contrary to expectations our experiment did not support the aposematic hypothesis. However, predation experiments with clay models have limitations and our results should be considered as preliminary, deserving further research to better understand the Northern Spectacled salamander prey-predator system.",

The objective of this study is to describe the species composition and richness of anurans in urban Cerrado fragments from Campo Grande municipality, Mato Grosso do Sul state, central Brazil. The specimens were sampled in three stages through pitfall traps and visual/acoustic surveys. Seventeen species were recorded (17.7% of anuran species registered in Mato Grosso do Sul), with Leptodactylidae and Hylidae being the most represented families. The existence of a high number of green areas and water bodies in the urban area likely favors anuran species in the region. The anuran communities in urban areas of Campo Grande were dominated by species which use a broad range of habitats. In this study there was the record of a new species of anuran, Proceratophrys dibernardoi , for the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The forest fragments that had the highest similarity for species composition were those with similar environmental conditions. The knowledge of the fauna that occurs in urban areas is important because natural habitats suffer severe fragmentation and degradation and species present in these areas may disappear in a shorter period of time.",

Female reproduction is remarkably seasonal and occurs in the warmer and wetter periods of the year. Secondary vitellogenesis occurs from mid to late spring, whereas gravidity and egg-laying occur in early summer. Mating appears to be synchronized with secondary vitellogenesis, indicating an associated reproductive cycle. We suggest that E. perditus females produce only a single clutch per reproductive season.

Here, we test this hypothesis in an ectothermic species, the dark-spotted frog, Pelophylax nigromaculatus . We found that relative brain size was not correlated with relative sizes of testes, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys or limb muscles within each sex. Moreover, we also failed to find significantly negative correlation among the expensive organs (i.e. testes, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys or limb muscles) in this frog. However, we observed a significantly positive correlation between liver residuals and kidney residuals.

The collections occurred between November 2014 and January 2016 in a preserved area of the subtropical Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. We compared the gastrointestinal content of 109 individuals distributed in the species Physalaemus biligonigerus, P. cuvieri, P. gracilis and P. henselii. We measured the Index of Relative Importance of each prey category and calculated trophic niche breadth using the Levins’ index (Bsta) and trophic niche overlap using the Pianka’s index (Ojk). We also applied compositional analysis to evaluate feeding specializations. Formicidae was the most important prey category for P. biligonigerus (IRI = 88.5%) and P. gracilis (IRI = 39.1%). For P. henselii and P. cuvieri, the most important category was Isopoda (IRI = 51.7% and 57.9%, respectively), followed by Formicidae (IRI = 34.9% and 24.8%). Isopoda was also important in the diet of P. gracilis (IIR = 28.6%), followed by Araneae (IIR = 22.6%). The trophic niche breadth of the four species was narrow, all smaller than 0.32, and the lowest was recorded for P. biligonigerus (0.04). The trophic niche overlap was higher between P. biligonigerus and P. cuvieri (96%), and between P. gracilis and P. henselii (95%). Only P. gracilis presented a significant level of feeding specialization. The differences in their diets suggest different uses of the resources, which could relate to different ways of exploring the microhabitat.",

Host sex also influenced endoparasite abundance, where males were parasitised more than females (Z-value: 6.260; P &lt; 0.001). When comparing the two seasons (dry and rainy), we observed that the greatest endoparasites abundance occurred during the rainy season (Z- value: -2.422; P &lt; 0.05). Regarding the lizards’ diet, we observed a high niche overlap (overlap index of 0.999), which indicates that males and females of S. torquatus consumed practically the same prey during the analysed period. The life cycle of the endoparasites found in S. torquatus was linked to seasonal variation, and the behavioural and physiological differences between sexes may have influenced the variations in endoparasite abundance.",

    "abstract": "The Black-spotted Paddy Frog (Micryletta nigromaculata) was recently discovered from northern Vietnam. Due to its restricted distribution in limestone karst forests and habitat degradation, the endemic species has been listed as “Endangered” in the IUCN Red List. However, knowledge about the natural history of this species is scarce, including data on its dietary ecology. Recent field surveys revealed new populations of M. nigromaculata occurring in Son La Province, northwestern Vietnam based on morphological analysis. Using the stomach-flushing method, we analyzed stomach contents of 45 individuals (21 males and 24 females) from a total of 52 captured frogs because stomachs of six males and one female (13.5%) were empty. The food spectrum of M. nigromaculata comprises 12 types with a total of 691 prey items (687 invertebrate items and four unidentified items), belonging to six insect orders, larvae and Araneae. Similar to other species of the family Microhylidae, M. nigromaculata is also identified as an ant (Formicidae) – termite (Rhinotermitidae) eating specialist with distinctly higher percentages of occurrence frequency (F = 65 %), number of prey items (N = 80 %), and importance (Ix = 75 %) than those of remaining types. The Simpson diversity index of 0.939 shows a high abundance of food prey in the wild, and the Evenness index of 0.536 suggests biased consumption of feeding selection for M. nigromaculata.",

    "abstract": "Effective thermoregulation is of vital importance since body temperature affects virtually all physiological and biochemical processes. Yet, our current knowledge in reptilian thermoregulation is largely based on a few, well-studied taxonomic groups. This is especially true in Europe, where our insights derive primarily from studies on the numerous lacertids of the continent. Skinks on the other hand remain understudied despite being abundant around the Mediterranean. In this paper we examine the thermoregulation effectiveness of the Ocellated Skink, a common lizard whose thermal biology has been overlooked, focusing on a population from a typical Mediterranean habitat in mainland Greece. We recorded body temperatures in the field and the lab and assessed the thermal quality of the habitat through operative temperatures. Our findings suggest that Chalcides ocellatus is a poor thermoregulator that stands very close to thermoconformity. The high thermal quality of the habitat allows the Ocellated Skink to regulate its temperature with less effort and lower accuracy. This indicates that C. ocellatus may have adopted a distinct thermoregulation strategy, most probably due to the particular life style of skinks.",

    "abstract": "The southern part of Montenegro has been identified as an area with high diversity of herpetofauna. However, comprehensive studies of distribution and diversity patterns of reptiles on the country level are still missing. Such studies are essential in designating areas of special conservation importance and nature protection planning in a milieu of increased habitat loss and degradation due to rapid urbanization and tourism development in this small Mediterranean country. To make progress on this problem, we analyzed distribution and diversity patterns of the lizards in Montenegro using a large database consisting of literature data and our unpublished records. We found that fifteen lizard species inhabit Montenegro, and two additional species may be present. The lizards were most diverse in the Maritime biogeographic region of Montenegro, while low diversity was found predominantly along the state borders in the Mountain-valley region. The identified pattern of lizard diversity is at least partly influenced by sampling bias. The eastern mountainous subregion had a distinct species composition compared to all other parts of the country. The East-Mediterranean chorotype was the most dominant, represented by seven species. The great diversity of the lizard fauna of Montenegro can be attributed to its specific topographic position with great influence of Mediterranean climate, heterogeneity of biomes, complex geological history and diverse physiogeographic features. High lizard species richness in the Maritime region and a unique species composition in the eastern subregion of Montenegro indicate that these areas are of high conservation interest.",

    "abstract": "Body injuries on snakes may serve as indices of predation rate, which is otherwise difficult to record by direct methods because of the usual scarcity and shy nature of these reptiles. We studied the incidence of body scarring and tail breakage in a Mediterranean colubrid, Hemorrhois hippocrepis , from south-eastern Spain. This species exhibits two traits that favour tail breakage, a long tail and active foraging tactics. The large sample (n = 328) of individuals acquired also enabled us to determine how the incidence of these injuries varies ontogenetically, between the sexes, in relation to energy stores, and to seek for the possible existence of multiple tail breakage. Overall, the incidence of tail breakage was rather low (13.1%) and similar to that of body scarring (12.7%). However, there was a significant ontogenetic shift in the incidence of tail breakage; such injuries barely appeared in immature snakes but stub-tailed individuals were present in 38.7% of snakes in the upper decile of body size. In contrast to most other studies, our data show a sex difference in the incidence of these injuries, adult male rates quadrupling those of adult females for body scarring and males maintaining larger stubs, probably because of the presence of copulatory organs housed in the base of the tail. Larger individuals did not have shorter tail stubs, a finding that does not support the multiple-tail-breakage hypothesis. Our results also fail to support the idea of a cost of tail breakage or body scarring in terms of body condition.",

Population size in a 1.42-hectare wetland was calculated to be 301 (± SE 5.89) individuals, mainly adults. The adult sex ratio was skewed toward males (3.1:1). Female home range size was larger than that of males, and males moved larger distances between relocation events.

Microhabitat segregation is a way for species to coexist, which reflects the specific habitat selection of coexisting species in a finer spatial scale. Despite quantitative studies have been conducted to investigate the microhabitat segregation of coexisting species, this type of studies was not often performed on tadpoles. In this study, we assessed the habitat selection of two coexisting tadpoles (Quasipaa boulengeri and Leptobrachium boringii) in a stream on Emei Mountain, China. Our results demonstrated that L. boringii and Q. boulengeri tadpoles occupied different microhabitats. Specifically, Q. boulengeri tadpoles preferred deep, narrow, and weak acid stream segments with slow current velocity and low value of conductivity, while L. boringii tadpoles tended to occur in a wide, shallow water bodies with relatively higher pH, conductivity, and current velocity. Overall, our study supported the Hutchinson’s niche concept, showing that at least one dimension of niche differentiation (i.e., microhabitat) occurred between coexisting tadpole species.",

    "abstract": "We here report the unexpected presence of the Italian wall lizard (Podarcis siculus campestris) on Gorgona Island, in the Parco Nazionale Arcipelago Toscano (Tuscan Archipelago, Tyrrhenian Sea, Tuscany, Central Italy). Field observations were carried out in 2020 confirming its presence on the island, where it had never been reported before. We recorded 37 GPS points of the species in three major areas of Gorgona (with 50 lizard records) and about 180 visual counts regarding all age classes (newborns, juveniles and adults). The species was found in the urban area (site of state prison) and in two grassy and bushed areas, around and along olive tree plantations. Seven individuals were captured and their tails were used to assess the sequence variation of the mitochondrial CYB gene. Biometrical parameters were also evaluated for six of these individuals. We detected three distinct CYB haplotypes that were compared to Podarcis siculus CYB sequences available in public databases. They resulted identical or phylogenetically closest to those found in mainland Tuscany. One haplotype, found in three specimens, was identical to one previously detected at Orti Bottagone (WWF Oasis in Piombino), while the other two haplotypes were most similar to haplotypes reported in the Giannella peninsula and Pisa, respectively.",

We provide the first account of inclusion of tonal sounds as part of the vocal repertoire of these species. Pure tones can (1) be long and form the entire call; (2) form prefixes of variable length separated by silence from the advertisement call; (3) be brief and form the onset or the offset of the regular advertisement call. Tonal calls may be an evolutionary novelty and they are not known from other populations of P. olfersii and P. lateristriga . Identification of the mechanism of sound production and of the behavioural role of these unique calls may help elucidate the evolution of call complexity in frogs.",

This code was proved reliable in the sample of 159 individuals from two separate populations and enabled easy and quick recognition of recaptured animals. The proposed method is inexpensive, easily applicable in the field, involves minimum stress for the animals and does not affect their behaviour and the possibility of repeated captures of “marked” (i.e., coded) individuals.

Males and female were recaptured more than 2 and 8 times, respectively. Males and females were recaptured from subsequent positions as far apart as 55 m and 30 m, as close as 0.2 m and 0.1 m. Average neighbor distances on successive capture positions of males recap- tured was 10.1 m, and that of females was 4.2 m, suggesting that there were significant difference in site fidelity between females and males. However, there was not signifi- cant average activity distance between the sexes. For females, small average activity areas were 10.9 ± 14.9 m 2 .",

In this study, CHT was detected in  Caiman latirostris  plasma, and characterized under laboratory controlled conditions of temperature, reaction time, plasma concentration, pH and salinity. The results complement other immunological studies performed in caimans and demonstrate that they possess an efficient and well-developed immune system that resists the attack of some pathogens. Based on the current knowledge of the properties and homologies of CHT, it would be highly valuable to evaluate its possible therapeutic application in the veterinary clinical setting.",

The lack of ecological studies on this species in Iran stimulated the current preliminary research on some basic biological traits. From April to July 2008, a total of fifty five snakes were collected from two stations in the southern part of the Caspian Sea coast, Iran: Gomishan Wetland and Sari. Basic morphometrics were compared between sexes and stations and gonadal development was compared between stations and seasons. At the two stations, adult sex ratio was not different from 1:1 and juveniles composed a predominant portion of the sample. Both sexes had unimodal length class size with a peak at 40-45 cm snout-vent length (SVL). Body sizes were unusually small for the species and no SVL sexual dimorphism was detected although males were relatively heavier than females for the same SVL. Snakes of both sexes attained larger size with better body condition at Sari than in Gomishan. Males and females carried more mature gonads in summer. However, in Sari males developed relatively larger testes earlier in the season and both sexes displayed less synchronic reproduction at this station. These results are best explained by local varia- tions in habitat, trophic availability and degree of environmental disturbance.",

The species has been the subject of several molecular and phylogeographic studies which highlighted the occurrence of distinct genetic lineages in different areas of the species distribution, but scarce cytogenetic data are currently available on the species. In this paper we present a molecular and karyological study performed with several banding, staining methods and NOR-FISH on samples of C. austriaca from different geographical areas (Italy and Greece) of the species distribution. The molecular and phylogenetic analysis unambiguously placed the studied samples in different clades with a clear geographical pattern. The karyotype of the two female samples studied was composed of 2n = 36 chromosomes with 16 macro- and 20 microchromosomes and a mix of plesiomorphic and derivate chromosome features. All macrochromosomes were biarmed with the exception of pair 5 that was telocentric. NORs were detected on a microchromosome pair. In both females, the pair 4 was heteromorphic (and completely heterochromatic after C-banding in the Italian female), representing the first report of a ZZ/ZW sex chromosome system with female heterogamety in C. austriaca. In addition, the W chromosome showed a different morphology between the two female studied (submetacentric and subtelocentric), highlighting the occurrence of a chromosomal diversification among distinct geographical areas of the species distribution and further supporting that the species contains different diverging evolutionary clades.",

Many processes that cause geographic variability in morphology have been proposed: population structure, phenotypic plasticity (environmental effects on development), and natural and/or sexual selection. Several hypotheses can explain patterns of sexual dimorphism in anurans, including natural or intra/inter-sexual selection, and differences in life history strategies between sexes. Limnomedusa macroglossa is considered a habitat specialist restricted to rocky outcrops in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. We evaluated the extent of sexual (size and shape) dimorphism in L. macroglossa from Uruguay based on morphometrics and secondary sexual characteristics, while taking into account geographic variation. Sexual dimorphism in body size of adults was found, but multivariate analyses did not demonstrate the existence of significant differences in shape. There were also significant differences in body size and hind leg measurements among six hydrographic basins as a result from the phenotypic plasticity correlated with local temperature, representing a clinal variation along the latitudinal gradient of Uruguay. The sexual dimorphism found in body size is probably the consequence of higher growth rates and/or late sexual maturity in females, which favors larger body size for accommodating larger ovaries, and thus, higher reproductive output.",

Next, we used APHIS to identify recaptured individuals after manually identifying the locations of intersections of the scales in the pileus and labial regions. In addition, we assessed whether images taken with a hand-held camera or by a smart phone affected the accuracy of APHIS. All recaptured snakes were correctly identified using APHIS from both camera or phone images as validated by our manually derived results.

Causes and consequences of this variation have been largely studied hitherto in controlled environments, but data from natural habitats is clearly less abundant. Here, we present a series of observations on the morphology – mainly tail depth – of three tadpole species from NE Iberian Peninsula across different pond typologies. According to experimental data on tadpole morphology and selective pressures along the pond permanency gradient, we should expect that tadpoles inhabiting ponds with a short hydroperiod – mainly facing desiccation risk – have shallower tail fins than tadpoles from ponds with longer hydroperiod – mainly facing predation risk. Thus, we expected that the link between these complementary selective pressures – predation risk, desiccation risk – and hydroperiod could make possible to detect intraspecific variation in tadpole morphology among different typologies of natural ponds. Morphological differences were found in all studied species, and variation, when present, agreed with theory: tadpoles had deeper fin tails as they were collected in ponds with a longer hydroperiod. Interestingly, in most cases these morphological differences were more marked as tadpoles were larger in size. Although distances among the studied ponds were generally short – posing phenotypic plasticity as the most plausible proximate mechanism – specifically designed studies would be needed to disentangle the relative role of other processes like local adaptation.",

Data of habitat uses and relative abundance were collected during five annual fieldtrips of seven days each one, from April 2010 to June 2014, in a mining zone of Canime Creek Basin, La Jagua de Ibirico, Cesar Department, northeast Colombia. Tadpoles and advertisement call were obtained in La Veguita Creek Basin, Manaure Balcon del Cesar, Cesar. We report six new localities with presence of A. ignotus , all between 7-96 km in straight line to the type locality, from 194-1236 m a.s.l. This species is recorded for the first time in the Tropical Dry Forest Life Zone and in La Guajira Department. Four substrate categories used by A. ignotus were detected (leaf-litter, rocks, naked floor, and lower branches), and differential use was highlighted. The larval morphology of A. ignotus was described, based on 11 specimens between 25-29 stages. Like other Allobates tadpoles, the gap of the second teeth row is “wide”. The advertisement call of A. ignotus is composed by a series of high frequency ascending pulsed notes. Possibly, the high frequency of the call is due to the acoustic disturbance generated by the streamflow noise of the creeks. In 2014, a decrease of relative abundance of A. ignotus in Canime Creek was detected. This, coupled to restricted distribution and loss of habitat quality are sufficient criteria to suggest the category of vulnerable for A. ignotus .",

The species has its known western limit of the distribution in the Veneto region of Italy. It is not known whether the species is really rare in Veneto or whether the area has been insufficiently surveyed. In addition, it is not known whether the westward distribution of the species is limited by a physiographic or by a climatic barrier. During the period 2016-2018, 118 sites were surveyed in the Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige regions. Four new occurrences of Iberolacerta horvathi were discovered in Veneto that: 1) largely fill the gap between the westernmost known site and the closest site to the east; 2) extend further west the known distribution by 9 km. In addition the species was confirmed in three already known sites. A species distribution model was developed with the software MaxEnt, using 100 occurrences from Italy, Austria and Slovenia. The best model shows that the distribution is explained by the asperity of their habitat, the sedimentary bedrock, the aspect, the average temperature of the coldest quarter, the rainfall seasonality and the average summer rainfall. The last variable appears as the most likely responsible for the rarefaction of the species at its western limit. In addition, the species distribution model suggest that the Horvath’s rock lizard might be present in some additional mountain groups where it has so far not been found yet.",

This study aimed at identifying biologically active fractions in the skin secretions of B. bombina, B. variegata, and their hybrid – B.bombina × B.variegata, and to clarify whether their components can modify certain parameters of the hemostasis system. For the skin secretion analysis, we performed ion-exchange chromatography, electrophoresis, and zymography assays. Plasma coagulation tests, chromogenic assays, and platelet aggregation assays were also conducted in vitro. As a result of the fractionation, a number of fractions were identified, where the proteins with miscellaneous molecular weights were revealed. The data also suggested that some fractions have proteolytic enzymes with gelatinolytic, fibrinogenolytic and collagenolytic activities. The proteins present in the fraction #5 of B. variegata and #5 of the hybrid secretions are characterized by the ability to prolong the clotting plug formation in the aPTT. Proteins capable of inducing platelet aggregation in the rabbit PRP are present in the fraction #3 of B. variegata secretions. The ability of dermal components to activate plasma proenzymes is indicative of the fact that the non-protein components of fraction #9 of B. variegata and fraction #7 of hybrid secretions initiated the appearance of thrombin and activated protein C in plasma.",

The influence of prey weight and prey species was tested at a constant temperature. We used three weight classes of each prey species to test the influence of prey weight on GPT. Our results showed that prey species affected GPT in a distinct way: mealworms induced a longer gut passage time compared to house crickets.

We investigated a total of 180 faecal samples of D. praticola s.l. from two locations in Bulgaria, and conducted a comparison between sex and age groups (adult males, adult females, and immatures). In addition, the correlations between the consumed prey and the available resources were also analysed. Food selectivity was analysed by comparing the faecal samples with pit-fall trap samples on the basis of abundance of prey items from particular operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Results indicate that the diet of the Meadow lizard contains mainly arthropods (insects and spiders) and the most abundant prey items belong to Araneae, Auchenorrhyncha, and Coleoptera. According to the used electivity indices none of the OTUs are highly preferred by D. praticola s.l., but Formicidae are the most avoided OTU for all sex/age groups. Differences in food preferences can be found between adults and immatures, while differences among males and females seem to be insignificant. The lack of clear differentiation between males and females could be a result of their similar size and locomotor ability. In conclusion, our results reveal that Darevskia praticola s.l. is a generalist and it shows no food specialization due to its narrow spatial niche.",

Since its introduction in Costa Rica, scarce information is available to understand why and how the habitat in the Turrialba town is suitable for the species. Our goal was to analyze the habitat selection of E. coqui to identify if there are key habitat features that explained its success there. We measured 9 site variables that may affect the habitat selection of E. coqui in 92 survey units of 10 m radius distributed over a 500 m radius from its introduction point. We registered the presence/pseudo-absence data of E. coqui and environmental variables in each survey unit during eight surveys. We ran occupancy models to determine the influence of the variables on the habitat selection and to estimate its detection probability. We found that sites near the introduction point, containing abundant vegetation, bromeliads, and palms have a higher probability to be occupied by E. coqui. The habitat selection in Costa Rica shares characteristics with the populations of Puerto Rico and Hawaii. But, unlike the case in Hawaii, in Costa Rica this species has maintained a limited dispersal because the potentially higher biotic resistance, as well a sedentary behavior. However, the microhabitat conditions used by E. coqui in the study site are common throughout the country. Therefore, active management in new populations and environmental education programs to avoid human transportation of the species is critical to reduce its dispersal.",

Male Sichuan digging frogs first appear at temporary ponds following the first heavy rain of the wet season and initiate calling. Females arrive at ponds shortly after males. Male frogs chorus extensively throughout the wet season during the evenings and nights following rainstorms. Female frogs leave the pond after laying eggs, and likely only lay one clutch annually. Amplexus lasted up to three hours. Females were larger than males in terms of body size, but we found no evidence of size-assortative mating. Clutch size varied from 920 to 2200 eggs, with egg diameter ranging from 1.33 to 1.93 mm. Larger female frogs laid more eggs, and there was no correlation between egg number and egg size. Tadpoles hatched from eggs within 18-20 hours of oviposition, and grew for 30-40 days before complete metamorphosis occurred. The initial body length of tadpoles ranged from 3-5 mm snout-vent length. Growth was fastest immediately after hatching, and declined asymptotically with increasing tadpole body size. Overall, Sichuan digging frogs have a breeding biology characterized by strong male-male competition with prolonged breeding coinciding with the annual wet season. Key w ords .

Although previous works have isolated yeasts from amphibian gastrointestinal tracts and skin, it is questionable whether these yeasts were acquired by ingestion or were commensals on adult individuals. Frog farms, an urban area and protected natural areas were surveyed and all tested positive for yeasts, which shows their ubiquity in both wild and farm-reared frogs. Additionally, the finding of yeasts in five different species of frogs and toads shows that there is a wide spectrum of hosts in this vertebrate group. Our results thus suggest that yeasts are likely to be widespread among amphibians in different habitat types and in a wide range of host species.",

Specifically, we find evidence against the adoption of sneaker mating strategies by small males in H. intermedia , and instead find variation both within and between populations in traits contributing to male conspicuousness.

    "abstract": "Population genetic studies are crucial for evolutionary biologists because the population is the basic substrate on which evolution is forged. However little empirical evidence has been able to demonstrate the role that isolation and gene flow play in maintaining differentiation in populations at short geographic scales. Epidalea calamita exhibits a steep variation in body size and reproductive traits in southwestern Spain, associated with changes in the geological substrate. This implies a decrease of 70.9% of body mass and 28.5% in snout-vent length, on a micro-geographic scale of only 60 km. Previous results from both metamorphic and juvenile common garden experiments showed that genetic differentiation may be a causal determinant of geographic variation in adult. This study tested whether neutral genetic differentiation can explain the geographical variation in the body size observed in E. calamita. It was addressed analyzing the level of genetic structuring and gene flow among populations along the cline, comparing the genetic diversity between and within populations, as well as between ecological environments. The study showed that the geographic variation in body size observed in E. calamita has evolved in absence of geographic isolation, with moderate gene flow connecting the populations. Thus, neutral genetic differentiation cannot explain the geographical variation observed. Future studies are needed on the interaction between the genetic component with the environmental factors and will be necessary to analyze the contribution of the maternal effects in the origin and evolution of the geographical variation in the body size observed in E. calamita from southern Spain.",

Here we assess the phylogenetic position and the population genetic structure of the Critically Endangered Karpathos frog, Pelophylax cerigensis , endemic to Karpathos Island. A total of 42 cytb sequences were examined including specimens from Rhodes Island, and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were generated to investigate the genetic structure and connectivity of the only two known populations on Karpathos. Molecular analyses reveal two major waterfrog lineages in the eastern Mediterranean: Clade A comprises Pelophylax bedriagae from the Middle East and the island of Cyprus, while clade B includes both P. bedriagae from the east Aegean Sea and P. cerigensis . Specimens from Karpathos and Rhodes constitute a single clade, contrasting previous studies, thus indicating the occurrence of Karpathos frog also to the neighboring Rhodes. The AFLP markers revealed low but statistically significant levels of genetic divergence between the two Karpathos’ populations and similar levels of genetic diversity. Our results suggest that the current taxonomy of the species should be re-evaluated. We also strongly recommend the need of conservation actions to maintain the levels of diversity in the declining population of the Karpathos frog.",

This species is a skillful runner that also bears micro spike-like protruding scales on its toepads (toe fringes), an adaptation for locomotion on sand. We worked with three populations living in habitats that differ in substrate type (sand, soil and rock). We measured sprint performance using a race-track with custom substrate platforms replicating the different substrate types. We formulated two hypotheses: first, we anticipated that the three populations would differ in their sprint performance due to the differences in substrate type; second, we expected that each population would perform better on its home substrate. Our results generally refuted the hypothesis that sprint performance would differ on different substrate types. Our results suggest that there is a restricted effect of substrate type on locomotion and indicate a multifactor interplay among alternative underlying parameters.",

    "abstract": "Traditional mark-recapture methods for amphibians and reptiles involve the application of invasive physical markers, such as toe clipping. Photographic identification methods are non-invasive alternative that use natural colouration of individuals for inexpensive, reliable identification. The relatively small species of the Hylidae family are susceptible to toe clipping – so dorsal, ventral, or leg patterns have been used in studies on different hylid species. The present study aims to test the usefulness of the lateral stripe in the Common tree frog Hyla arborea in software-assisted image recognition, which would allow for a reliable and time-efficient individual identification. A total of 258 adult tree frogs from a pond near the village of Oshtava, SW Bulgaria, were captured by hand in twelve sessions throughout the spring (April-May) of 2022 and 2023. The right and left side of each frog was photographed and the animals were released at the site of capture. Images were loaded into Hotspotter – free software for image recognition that has been demonstrated to work very well for several amphibian species. Results revealed 108 recaptures of 46 individual tree frogs (including 11 tree frogs captured more than twice and three recaptures between years). Only 12% of all frogs had similar right and left lateral stripes, with the others displaying significant variations. This study highlights both the applicability of the lateral stripe for individual recognition in this species and the need for consistency in image processing.",

Although several studies describe the diet in populations with only one taxon, there is a lack of data from mixed populations. We studied the diet in mixed populations of edible frogs at three sites for three years. We collected gut contents from 221 adult frogs using the stomach flushing method and identified 1,477 prey items. The diet consisted mainly of insects (88%). For all three taxa, the most frequently consumed prey groups were Hymenoptera (28%), Coleoptera (18%), Lepidoptera (17%) and Diptera (11%). Larger prey (in terms of length and volume) was mainly consumed by P. ridibundus, followed by P. esculentus. The smallest prey were mainly consumed by P. lessonae. However, P. ridibundus consumed fewer prey items than P. lessonae. No significant difference was found between the taxa in the staple diet, while there were differences in the less abundant prey categories, especially between P. ridibundus and P. lessonae. The narrowest trophic niche width was observed in P. lessonae, followed by P. esculentus, and the widest in P. ridibundus. Our results suggest that the diet of the three taxa is diverse and consists of a large number of invertebrate groups. However, the diet was locality-specific, with the dominance of different prey groups in different localities depending on habitat characteristics. These results confirm our expectation that the frogs of the Pelophylax esculentus complex follow an opportunistic foraging strategy, as predicted by optimal foraging theory.",

The experimentation consisted of recording the calling individual previously, during and after an exposure to urban noise. After that, individuals were measured to evaluate the Scaled Mass Index (SMI), and individual and environmental temperatures were taken. Also, considering that individuals of this species present harmonic shifting, we tried to evaluate which factors (individual, acoustic, or environmental) are associated with this phenomenon. We observed that the individuals showed an increase in call activity after exposure to traffic noise, but none of the evaluated aspects here could explain the harmonic shifting in their calls. Considering that this increasing on call activity also means an increasing of individual’s expense of energy, traffic noise is potentially harmful to the communication of A. leucopygius and, consequently, to its permanence in the site.",

Population monitoring through artificial retreat-sites (ARS) was implemented on French’s Grand Rouveau and If islands to study the effects of management measures. We used Generalized Linear Models to identify: (i) the environmental variables (such as substrate, vegetation, and exposure to wind and sun) influencing the maximum number of individuals observed in ARS (studied in both islands); and (ii) the factors influencing ARS daily use (occupancy), including individual attributes such as age and weight, external temperature, and disturbance (Grand Rouveau only). The maximum number of geckos appeared to be determined by the thermal properties of ARS, as mediated by exposure to the dominant wind and sunlight, rather than by the structure of the habitat and nearby vegetation. An individual gecko’s presence in an ARS was positively related to its presence in the same ARS on the previous day and negatively related to its age, the temperature of the previous night, and the number of days of disturbance. These results provide insights into the factors governing the selection and use of ARS by the European leaf-toed gecko and open perspectives on the use of ARS for the monitoring and conservation of this and other elusive terrestrial reptiles.",

This study assesses the impact of climate change on the spatial and temporal patterns of optimal conditions for activity in two burrowing frogs, Smilisca fodiens and S. dentata. Ecological Niche Modeling was used to implement niche seasonality models, with calibration performed during the peak activity (July). These models were then transferred to current and future conditions for the remainder of the year, predicting future scenarios up to 2070 with an intermediate trajectory greenhouse gas concentration of 4.5 W/m2. Climate change transferability was assessed for four potential scenarios: 1) high precipitation and low temperature, 2) high precipitation and high temperature, 3) low precipitation and low temperature, and 4) low precipitation and high temperature. We examined the impact across future projected areas and analyzed geographic change trends based on latitude, longitude, and elevation. For both species, the best scenario would involve increased precipitation in the future. However, the worst-case would be a combination of reduced precipitation and higher temperatures. Due to large area loss, northern populations of S. fodiens may be highly vulnerable. Concerning S. dentata, the outlook is worrisome, with all known populations experiencing losses in most months. Area gains may not help either species since they tend to occur at elevations above their known ranges. Using a seasonal approach in spatio-temporal analysis enhances comprehension of the behavioral adaptations of seasonal species and their vulnerability to current and future climatic variations",

Approximately 43% of all amphibian species are facing extinction due to factors such as habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and emerging diseases. The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) represents one of the major threats, because it is particularly dangerous for European salamanders. Southern Europe is especially vulnerable due to the presence of numerous endemic salamander species. Despite the risks, few studies have screened Italian salamanders for Bsal. We conducted a Bsal screening on 44 Golden Alpine Salamanders (Salamandra atra aurorae) from the Vezzena plateau in the Trentino-Alto Adige region (Northern Italy). Our molecular analysis of skin swabs revealed no presence of Bsal in any of the 44 specimens examined. Additionally, no macroscopic signs of Bsal-related skin damage were observed. The absence of Bsal in our samples is encouraging, suggesting that the investigated sites are currently unaffected by this pathogen. This finding aligns with other studies reporting no evidence of Bsal in Italy. Future research should explore the factors contributing to the absence of Bsal and the effectiveness of current conservation practices. While our findings are reassuring, the threat of Bsal remains a critical concern. Continued vigilance and enhanced conservation efforts are essential to protect salamander diversity and ensure the long-term survival of these important amphibian populations.",

Aiming to test the actual presence of these structures and provide a clearer characterisation of the maxillary dentition of the species, we analysed 17 dry-prepared and disarticulated H. viridiflavus specimens using both scanning electron and optical microscopy. The imaging confirmed the presence of posterior, enlarged maxillary teeth displaying a distal carina, highlighted by shallow longitudinal inflections on the disto-labial and disto-lingual tooth surfaces. Nonetheless, the analysis revealed the consistent absence of the meso-labially placed groove typical of opisthoglyphous taxa.

We tested whether transparent body form of M. ornata tadpoles is a useful attribute against predation by exposing tail fin stained (with the Nile blue) subjects to a naturally occurring predator (Hoplobatrachus tigerinus tadpoles that detect prey using both visual and chemical cues). The study shows that susceptibility of stained M. ornata tadpoles to predation increased significantly compared to the unstained transparent individuals.

We used tadpoles of the stone frog Limnomedusa macroglossa (Alsodidae): (1) to assess the variation in body and tail shape; (2) to examine the effect of streamlet depth and allometry on tadpole shape, and (3) to re-describe and compare the tadpole external morphology with closely related species. We obtained the body shape and size from 150 tadpoles. The re-description was based on 57 qualitative and 24 quantitative characters, from 19 tadpoles between stages 30 and 37 and 31 to 37, respectively. Allometry was the major factor influencing the lateral view of body shape: smaller tadpoles had round bodies and eyes and nostrils positioned more laterally in comparison with larger ones. Thus, the power of ontogenetic variations reported here makes the tadpole developmental “climax” period a questionable concept that deserves additional attention. The depth gradient of streamlets also affected the shape: in shallower environments, the tadpoles presented a decrease in height of the body, fins and tail muscles, and an increase in body width. These results may indicate adaptations allowing better swimming performance in lotic environments with intense water flow. The external morphological characterization of L. macroglossa presented here differed from that previously reported, mainly due to coloration, body shape, nostril, anal tube, tail, shape and position of nostrils and snout. Additionally, we presented unknown traits for this species, making comparisons with closely related species within the Alsodidae family.",

With regards to Italy, to date, only two samples have been analysed both from the Province of Pisa, Tuscany, pointing at that fact that genetic characterisation of Italian populations is still lacking. Accordingly, we have increased the sampling coverage with 19 new samples from northern and central regions of Italy, including two populations, apparently disconnected from the rest of the known range, and analysed their phylogenetic relationships using a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Our results confirm the general phylogenetic arrangement detected in previous studies; specifically for Italian populations, no variability emerged from the Apennine populations, and a slight differentiation could be shown for the Alpine and subalpine ones. This pattern can be explained assuming past spread and recent isolation of C. girondica relict populations in the Alpine region, likely during the Last Glacial Maximum. Later, during the Holocene, the Italian Alps and the Po Plain went through various climatic variations and high anthropization which may have influenced C. girondica distribution through expansion and contraction processes.",

Although the model indicates a wide area of Marche and Abruzzo as suitable for R. temporaria, the actual distribution of the species in northern and central Apennine appears strongly associated with sandstones.

Coverboards offer herpetofauna protection from predators and space to thermoregulate their body temperature. These covers also create microhabitats that differ from their surrounding habitat. We placed plywood and metal coverboards along a transect that crossed from prairie floodplain into upland prairie. Coverboards were checked over a three-week period during the fall season, during morning, afternoon, and dusk. Snake species were identified and counted, and ambient temperatures and humidity were checked under each coverboard. We found four snake species across the habitat gradient, common gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis), plains gartersnake (T. radix), Dekay’s brownsnake (Storeria dekayi), and Western foxsnake (Pantherophis ramspotti). Species richness was greatest in the floodplain habitat and microhabitat associated with metal coverboards. The floodplain habitat was also the habitat predominantly used by common gartersnake and Dekay’s brownsnake. Dekay’s brownsnakes, furthermore, preferred utilizing metal coverboards over wood. The composition of snake species we observed suggests that the restoration efforts on this tallgrass prairie system have attracted some grassland snake species, but the possibility of a greater snake community remains. Our data suggest that using metal coverboards during the cooler active seasons, such as fall and spring, will increase capture success and more efficiently sample snake communities. Studies such as ours to better understand habitat and coverboard use will result in more efficient sampling of herpetofauna for conservation and monitoring efforts.",

The present study aimed to analyze the karyotype of O. americanus, providing a detailed and comparative description of conventional chromosomal markers, with focus on a possible diploidization process operating in this polyploid genome. The individuals were collected in a fragment of Atlantic Forest in the south-central region of Paraná State, Brazil. The analyzed individuals presented the tetraploid pattern, with biarmed chromosomes. The C-banding showed heterochromatic regions restricted to centromeres and telomeres. Among homologous chromosomes of the same quartet, small differences were observed in morphology, possibly the result of differentiation after the polyploidization event. Finally, the 45S rDNA (Nucleolar Organizer Regions) was mapped in the short arm of quartet 11, showing the nucleolus organizing regions active in the four homologous chromosomes. This genome, although structurally polyploid, may be undergoing a process of diploidization, by becoming functionally equivalent to a diploid genome, via chromosomal rearrangements, epigenetic mechanisms, and/or repetitive DNA dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean pond turtle Mauremys leprosa is widely distributed in Morocco. Significant variations could be observed in this species due to the fact that it occupies a vast and environmentally diverse area. Thus, the analysis of population parameters is crucial in elucidating the differences between populations. Differences between individuals may be linked to environmental factors, including many habitat characteristics. In the present study, variation in population structure, body condition, morphology and sexual dimorphism, were examined for the Sahara Desert blue-eyed turtle M. l. saharica in southern Morocco from seven distinct localities distributed in four different drainages in southern Morocco. A total of 224 turtles were captured, sexed, weighed and then measured for their carapace and tail dimensions before being released. Among the studied populations, four were dominated by adult individuals (Taakilt: 96%, Oued Guir: 87%, Oued Ziz: 75%, Sidi ElMehdaoui: 70%), two comprised 100% of adults (Oued Noun and Tarmigt) and one population consisted of 50% adults (Lower Draa). The sex ratio was significantly different between populations, being balanced in two populations (Tarmigt and Sidi El Mehdaoui), male-biased in three populations (Oued Zizi, Oued Noun, Lower Draa) and female-biased in the two remaining populations (Oued Guir and Taakilt). Body Condition Index (BCI, g/cm3) was significantly different among populations but not between sexes, or for the Sex × Locality interaction. The Sexual Size Dimorphism (SSD), females being larger than males, varies among population with the greatest degree observed in Oued Guir population (SSD = 0.41) and the lowest in Sidi El Mehdaoui population (SSD = -0.14). Length-Weight Relation (LWR) shows that M. l. saharica has isometric growth for both male and female of Oued Guir and Tarmigt, for female of Oued Ziz, Taakilt, Oued Noun and lower Draa and hypo-allometric for male of Oued Ziz, Taakilt, Oued Noun, Lower Draa and for both male and female of Sidi El Mehdaoui. Morphological variation of carapace is shown in this species associated with population variation among basins. Increased understanding of population characteristics and their fitness status must be considered in conservation and management action plans for the species and its habitat.",

    "abstract": "The energy storage plays a prominent part in the life histories of many animals inhabiting cold harsh environment, thus anuran amphibians rely on larger residual energy stores from post-hibernation to cope with unfavourable weather conditions before breeding. As the habitat conditions often change in different locations, selective pressure for energy storage could also vary. However, we still have limited knowledge on whether anurans living under different environmental backgrounds would adopt suitable strategies to cope with energy demands during reproduction. Here, we examined patterns of energy storage in spring (after hibernation and before reproduction) in seven plateau brown frog (Rana kukunoris) populations with different climatic conditions in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. After removing the effects of age and body size, liver weights of both sexes and fat body weights in males were negatively correlated with temperature, suggesting that these reserves were critical for this anuran to survive through harsh and extended dormancy period under uncertain environmental conditions. Additionally, reproductive investment in both sexes could partly explain the increase in post-hibernation energy stores with decreasing temperature. Males had relatively heavier liver and fat body weights than females, indicating that males store more energy reserves for breeding activity compared with females. Therefore, we suggest that both the variation of environmental conditions and sexual differentiation of reproductive roles play a prominent role in shaping the energy allocation and reserve patterns in the dormancy and breeding of amphibian species.",

Locomotion, boldness and freezing behavior changed over time, in agreement with a previous study carried out in central Pyrenees, but without highlighting a clear behavioral difference among color morphs.

We found that the size of right testes increased with temperature, but not left testes.

The operational sex ratio did not affect DTA, but there was a positive correlation between DTA and temperature, suggesting that differences in the length of activity period and resources availability across locations may affect the energy budget of this frog, resulting in a gradual change in reproduction energy parallel to increasing temperature.",

    "abstract": "Anuran larvae in aquatic environments are important prey items for several vertebrate and invertebrate species. Besides avoiding predation, there are some strategies that may reduce the physical damage in those tadpoles that survive the predation attempt. For example, the injured tadpole tail can regrow after a predator bite, but few studies have examined the consequences of such injury. We examined the consequences of three levels of injury to the tail and how this influenced development and feeding behavior of tadpoles of the Neotropical elegant treefrog, Dendropsophus elegans. We collected spawns and kept them in the laboratory until tadpoles reached Gosner’s stages 28 to 35. Then, they were separated in four experimental groups: individuals with tail trimmed in 30, 50 or 70 % of its length, and a control group, with no tail removing. We counted the days until metamorphosis, calculated the Scaled Mass Index (SMI) through weight and length of newly-metamorphosed, and evaluated the feeding frequency to evaluate the influence of tail amputation on them. We found that the time until metamorphosis was positively related to the extent of the amputation, but SMI and feeding behavior were not influenced. As the time to metamorphose is related to the survivorship chances of individuals: i.e., if the aquatic environment is with high density of predators, it would be advantageous to rapidly metamorphose out of the water. However, tail injury delays the metamorphose process, which could influence the survival of the individual.",

    "abstract": "Because of their peculiar genomic and chromosomal characteristics, reptiles are extraordinary model organisms to study karyotype and sex chromosome evolution, but despite the growing interest in their evolutionary cytogenetics, only a small fraction of species have a known karyotype. We performed a comparative cytogenetic analysis on Elaphe quatuorlineata and Zamenis lineatus, using classic and molecular techniques. We provide the karyotype of these two species and an assessment of their chromosomal features. Chromosome analysis was performed with standard karyotyping, C-banding, sequential C-banding + CMA3 + DAPI and Ag-NOR staining. On E. quatuorlineata, we also performed CMA3-methyl green staining and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization mapping NOR loci (NOR-FISH). Elaphe quatuorlineata and Z. lineatus show a very similar karyotype of 2n = 36, with 8 macro- and 10 microchromosome pairs, but differ in the morphology of the pair 8, which resulted submetacentric in the former and metacentric in the latter species. By comparing our data to those available from the literature on congeneric species, we analysed the occurrence of primitive and derivate chromosomal characters and provide cytotaxonomic insights, which further support the species status of Z. lineatus. In both species, the 4th pair was identified as the sex chromosome pair (ZZ/ZW) and NORs were localized on a microchromosome pair. We finally highlight in both genera Elaphe and Zamenis different stages of heterochromatinization of the W chromosome, in agreement with the progressive diversification model of sex chromosome as already shown in different reptile taxa.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of most biological processes is temperature dependent and, within physiological limits, on average, warmer is better. This axiom of biology has led to a wide range of adaptations for dealing with temperatures that are outside of an organism’s preferred temperature. Many pond-breeding amphibians lay their eggs during early spring, when water temperatures are near freezing. Communal nest-site selection has been proposed as a mechanism to increase developmental temperatures, and temperatures near the center of egg-mass aggregations are elevated relative to egg-masses on the aggregation’s periphery. It is unclear whether this spatial variation in temperature is due to concentration of metabolic heat, absorption of solar radiation, or both. Here, we explore finer scale spatial variation within egg masses of the wood frog Rana sylvatica, one of the earliest amphibians to breed during the North American spring. We compared peripheral and core temperatures of egg masses that were exposed either to 1) ambient sunlight from above, or 2) sunlight reflected by a mirror from below. We found that differences between core and peripheral temperatures were higher in the control than in the mirror treatment, but core and peripheral temperatures were statistically indistinguishable in both cases. Moreover, the difference in peripheral and internal temperatures increased significantly over the course of development. However, these trends were only significant in ambient sunlight and actually decreased in the mirror group. Our results suggest that the benefits of communal nesting are also experienced by individual egg masses, albeit to a lesser extent. In addition, the lack of effect in shaded egg masses suggests that the thermal advantage is tied to sun exposure and not due to concentration of metabolic heat.",

    "abstract": "Hematological studies in crocodilians are important tools in the evolutionary diagnosis and control of sicknesses, such as anaemia, malnutrition, dehydration, inflammation, and parasitism, among others. We aimed to obtain reference intervals for the hemogram of Caiman latirostris in wild populations that inhabit Recife’s Metropolitan Region, Pernambuco. We obtained blood samples from 42 caimans, from different sexes (22 males and 20 females) and ages classes (eight hatchlings, 24 subadults and 10 adults) in two areas of Atlantic Rainforest domain. We found that hematological parameters were included within the reference intervals for other crocodilian species. It was possible to observe differences between the areas for the mean corpuscular volume values, suggesting a possible difference between adult and juvenile individuals in the two study areas. When comparing sexes, there was no significant difference between the study parameters, but it was possible to observe differences in the mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and hemoglobin in the Estação Ecológica de Tapacurá region. Although small differences have been observed between the two populations, we can infer that the hematological parameters are similar. We can use this information to evaluate animal’s health in nature and for comparations with captive individuals, allowing the establishment of ideal maintenance conditions and assisting in the identification of possible pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Sexual size dimorphism is widespread among snakes and has also been observed in lengths of body appendages such as in tails. Males typically possess longer tails than females and this dimorphism in tail length has generally been attributed to the importance of the tail in mating and reproduction. We used body size measurements, snout-vent length (SVL) and tail length (TL) as well as a body condition index (BCI) as a measure of quality in Caspian Whip Snakes from Hungary, in order to shed light on sexual dimorphism patterns. The SVL of males (1061 ± 133 mm, n = 25) were significantly longer than that of females (887 ± 208 mm, n = 41). However, the proportion of TL to total length was lower in males than in females (0.257 ± 0.018 and 0.274 ± 0.017, respectively). The BCI of females (386 ± 10) was significantly higher than that of males (343 ± 15). Females having proportionally longer tails compared to males seems to be the reverse of the usual trend. Selective pressures on the tails of female snakes are less obvious, as tail length may be linked to more than one function, and hence be simultaneously subjected to more than one type of selective force.",
