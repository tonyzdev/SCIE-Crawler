    "abstract": "In this study, numerical predictions of the scale effect for circular footings supported by partially replaced, compacted, layers on natural clay deposits are presented. The scaleeffect phenomenon was analyzed according to the footing sizes. Numerical analyses were carried out using an axisymmetric, two-dimensional, finite-element program. Before conducting the analysis, the validity of the constitutive model was validated using field tests performed by authors with seven different footing diameters up to 0.90 m and with three different partial replacement thicknesses. It is shown that the behavior of the circular footings on natural clay soil and the partial replacement system can be reasonably well represented by the Mohr Coulomb model. The MohrCoulomb model parameters were derived from the results of conventional laboratory and field tests. After achieving a good consistency between the results of the test and the numerical analysis, the numerical analyses were continued by increasing the footing diameter up to 25 m, considering the partial replacement thickness up to two times the footing diameter. The results of this parametric study showed that the stabilization had a considerable effect on the bearing capacity of the circular footings and for a given value of H/D the magnitude of the ultimate bearing capacity increases in a nonlinear manner with the footing diameter. The Bearing Capacity Ratio (BCR) was defined to evaluate the improved performance of the reinforced system. It was found, based on numerical and field-test results that the BCR of the partially replaced, natural clay deposits increased with an increase in the footing diameter and there was no significant scale effect of the circular footing resting on natural clay deposits.",

These parameters depend primarily on the size of clay minerals, their quantity in soil composition and the interlayer water quantity in expanding clay minerals. This article asserts that there exists also the exactly defined relationship also between the water content and consolidation pressure. In the function describing this relationship, the type of soil is determined by two parameters. They can be expressed depending on the same mineralogical properties of soils as the values of parameters in the function showing the relationship between the water content and the undrained shear strength. These findings allow us to express the ratio between undrained shear strength and consolidation pressure depending on mineralogical properties of soils.",

This contribution was prepared especially for the 12 th Suklje Symposium, and recognises that landslides occur both in mountain regions as well as in lowland regions during and following extreme-rainfall conditions. The Institute (and Professorship) for Geotechnical Engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) has been engaged over several years in projects concerned with the characterisation, monitoring and modelling behaviour of slopes in mainly granular porous media across the full range of altitudes in Switzerland. A link is made to the doyen of the Suklje day and then three case histories are presented and discussed to demonstrate the principal reactions to seasonal rainfall. A small slip was released in two of these cases and the “triggering” factors have been investigated and are discussed in this contribution. It transpires that the mode of inslope drainage influences the way in which the ground saturates and hence the volume of the potentially unstable ground. Simple stability analyses using limit equilibrium and soil parameters that have been amended to account for unsaturated soil behaviour were found to function well for slopes in largely granular media.",

    "abstract": "A new, elasto-plastic, analytical-numerical solution, considering the axial-symmetry condition, for a circular tunnel excavated in a strain-softening and Hoek–Brown rock mass is proposed. To examine the effect of initial stress variations, and also the boundary conditions at the ground surface, the formulations are derived for different directions around the tunnel. Furthermore, the effect of the weight of the plastic zone is taken into account in this regard. As the derived differential equations have no explicit analytical solutions for the plastic zone, the finite-difference method (FDM) is used in this study. On the other hand, analytical expressions are derived for the elastic zone. Several illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution, and to examine the effect of various boundary conditions. It is concluded that the classic solutions, based on the hydrostatic far-field stress, and neglecting the effect of the boundary conditions at the ground surface, give applicable results for a wide range of practical problems. However, ignoring the weight of the plastic zone in the analyses can lead to large errors in the calculations.",

For this purpose, the NLP optimization model OPTINC was developed. The safety factor and the optimal inclination of the soil nails from the horizontal direction depend on the design of the soil-nail wall. Based on these results the ANFIS-INC model was developed for the prediction of the optimal inclination of the soil nail for any design of soil-nail wall. Additionally, an ANFIS-SF model was developed to predict the safety factor for different inclinations of the wall, the slope angle of the terrain, the length of the nails, and the hole diameter. It was found that the inclination of the soil nail should be adjusted to the inclination of wall, the length of nail, the slope angle of the terrain and the hole diameter. With increasing inclination of the wall, the length of the soil nail and the hole diameter, the safety factor is increasing. On the other hand, the safety factor is decreasing with the increasing slope angle of the terrain. The use of nonlinear programming and an Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System allows a comprehensive analysis of the geotechnical problems.",

    "abstract": "A series of 94 laboratory tests were conducted to measure the response of pile foundation when subjected to dynamic loads. Eight tests were conducted on single pile in dry soil at relative density 30 % (loose) and 50 % (medium); 66 tests on group of piles with different spacings and patterns. All tests were carried out under operating frequencies 0.5, 1 and 2 Hz under horizontal shaking. All tests were achieved with one embedment ratio (L/d = 30). These tests were grouped in three different numbers of piles; 2 piles in row and line patterns, 3 piles and 4 piles; and three pile spacing ratios (s/d = 3, 4 and 5). The results of dry soil indicating the mechanism of dynamic response of piles and soil subjected to dynamic horizontal shaking include the variation and distribution of acceleration with time in different states of soil in addition to the vertical and horizontal displacements, end-bearing load, peak acceleration and the peak velocity of foundation. It was concluded that for a dry soil bed, the acceleration amplitudes increase with frequency for both soil relative densities (loose and medium) and different pile patterns (number; single or group and different spacing ratios s/d). The maximum acceleration in the foundation is lower than in the soil bed for all operating shaking frequencies, pile spacing ratios and soil states. The decreasing of the maximum acceleration recorded in the foundation as compared to that in the soil bed is between 10-100 % for loose and medium state of soil, and the decrease in loose state is more than in medium state. This means that there is damping effect or attenuation of vibration waves. The amplitudes of recorded acceleration in the pile cap are much higher than in the soil bed for single pile and pile group with different pile spacing ratios, also these amplitudes are increasing with increase of shaking frequency and relative density of the soil.",

    "abstract": "Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been applied to determine the subsurface karstic features during the construction of the national highway in the south-eastern part of Slovenia. The highway construction is situated mostly in the dinaric karstic region with a high density of karstic features visible on the surface. Ground-penetrating radar prospecting was done in all areas where a slope was cut into the limestone bedrock. The main purpose of the survey was to map potentially hazardous zones in the highway subsurface and to detect and characterize the karst. The ground-penetrating radar method was used because of the heterogeneous nature of the karst. With its high degree of karsticifaction and geological diversity all conventional methods failed. One of GPR’s main advantages is that, while the penetration depth is limited to several meters, the obtained resolution can be on the scale of centimeters and the measured profile is continuous. Because of the ground-penetrating radar’s limitations with respect to depth, the range surveying was done simultaneously with the road construction using 200-MHz bistatic antenna on the level of the highway plane. All the 2D radargrams were constructed in 3D models where the measurements were made in raster with 2 meters between a single GPR profile. This two-meters spacing was determined as the optimal value in which only a minimal resolution-price tradeoff was made. The gathered results were tested and compared to experimental drillings and excavations so that any anomalies and reflections were calibrated.\r\nThe drilling was conducted twice, first to calibrate the radargram reflections and secondly to check and confirm the calibration success. Altogether, over 30 boreholes were drilled at various previously selected locations. The data obtained from the drilling proved to be very helpful with the calibration since anomalies found during the drilling were almost exclusively (over 95%) a result of the propagation of radar waves from the limestone to an air void or from the limestone to a clay pocket.\r\nDrilling test boreholes proved to be a very useful tool for the calibration of the GPR anomalies recorded in 2D radargrams. Such a process showed a near 100 % accuracy with respect to interpreting the subsurface features, with 77% correctly interpreted as caves or clay pockets and 23% wrongly interpreted, where the interpretation was a void but it was indeed partly a clay-filled and partly an air-filled void. The completed survey also showed simultaneous surveying with GPR and road construction is a very efficient and economical way to predict various karstic features and the density of the karstic forms.",

    "abstract": "We present an methodology for a more detailed and less ambiguous spatial structure interpretation of small, shallow landslides. The spatial structure interpretation of this type of landslides bases on both underground and surface models and requires high-density data. This methodology involves the use of ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) techniques. GPR technique, used for the definition of the underground structure model, provides a time-efficient survey that yields high-resolution data, making it suitable for a shallow subsurface analysis. ERT technique was used only to confirm the results obtained by the GPR survey, since it is more time consuming and more convenient for larger and deeper landslides investigations. The surface model is created using TLS technique, which is time- and cost-effective, produces a large amount of data and is favourable for smaller areas, such as the analysed type of landslides.\r\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, existing procedures based on either conventional or non-invasive geophysical methods, observe, almost exclusively, larger and deeper landslides. Their real-time monitoring involves a number of sensors and is hardly applicable to small landslides because of their number, location and dimensions. Considering the benefits of each applied technique and the interpretation of the results obtained from field data, it is clear that the main advantages of the realized application are the efficiency and applicability for small shallow landslides whose number and impact on the environment are dominant. Therefore, it represents a solid basis for landslide mitigation.\r\nThe verification of the methodology was made on a small, shallow landslide in the village of Vinca, near Belgrade, Serbia.",

    "abstract": "Construction Engineers typically avoid the use of expansive soils as construction materials because they are usually difficult to work on and can cause structural failure. This research work investigates how the application of sawdust to tropical clay and bentonite influences their geotechnical properties in order to determine their suitability for use as landfill liner materials for the effective containment of toxic substances from landfills. X-ray diffractometer, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to determine the mineralogical composition, oxide composition and microstructure, respectively, of the clay and bentonite. Series of laboratory tests were conducted to determine the specific gravity, Atterberg limits, compaction, unconfined compressive strength and permeability characteristics of the clay and bentonite for varying proportion of sawdust application. Generally, increasing percentage of sawdust caused a reduction in its specific gravity, maximum dry unit weight and unconfined compressive strength, while it caused an increase in the optimum moisture content and permeability of the modified clay and bentonite. The clay and bentonite both have sufficiently low permeability that satisfies the hydraulic conductivity requirement for use as clay liners. Eight percent (8%) sawdust application to a clay having similar properties as that of this study is recommended as an economic way of modifying it – with the potential of improving its adsorbent property - for use in landfill liner system in order to contain toxic substances from leaching from landfills, thereby protecting the environment and public health.",

    "abstract": "The investigated area around Stara Baska settlement (the Island of Krk, NE channel part of the Adriatic Sea) is in a delicate geodynamic balance. Marine erosion is quite prominent and the recorded cliff retreat between 1966 and 2004 was from 4 to 5 meters. The cliff slopes are formed in talus breccias. Strong waves and formations of wave-cut notches are the main causes of the cliff's instability. The secondary causes are the weathering and erosion of the soil and rocks on the cliff. The slump of the cliff slope can occur in a rock mass with higher strength parameters, where the notches are cut a few meters inward into the toe of the cliff slope. A combined method for the stability analysis of the coastal cliffs was tested ; this incorporates the cantilever- beam model and the structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. This method can provide highly detailed 3D geometrical data of the cliff, which can then be used in the calculations of the stability model. This is particularly important in a stability analysis of lithologically heterogeneous rocks such as breccias with varied geometry, which cannot be easily replaced by a rectangular surface. The simple and useful SfM method overcomes the limitations of traditional surveys in estimating the cliff overhang surface and the notch length.",

    "abstract": "The numerical simulation of intact rock microstructure and its influence on macro-scale behaviour has received a lot of attention in the research community in recent years. Generating a grain-like structure with polygonal area contacts is one of the avenues explored for describing the rock’s microstructure. A Voronoi tessellation implemented in the Universal Distinct-Element Code (UDEC) is used to generate models with a polygonal microstructure that represent intact rock. The mechanical behaviour of the Voronoi polygons is defined by micro-properties, which cannot be measured directly in the laboratory. A numerical calibration procedure is needed to produce the macroscopic response of a model that corresponds to the material behaviour measured during a laboratory experiment. In this research, Brazilian, direct tensile, uniaxial compressive and biaxial test models are constructed to simulate the intact rock behaviour under a standard laboratory stress. An extensive series of parametric sensitivity analyses are executed in order to understand the influence of the input micro-properties on every model test behaviour and predict the relation between the micro-properties and the model’s macro response. The results can be treated as general guidelines for a complete and efficient intact rock calibration procedure. In parallel, a continuum-based model using the Mohr-Coulomb constitutive relationship is running as a benchmark. It has been shown that the Voronoi-based models through their microstructure approach better reproduce the Brazilian to direct tensile strength ratio, and show a better representation of the dilation, crack pattern and post-peak behaviour in comparison to continuum models.",

The pile discontinuity and defects were modelled by reducing the specific finite elements and the elastic modulus of concrete. The wave-propagation response of the pile was analyzed based on a step-by-step numerical integration using the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT) method in the time domain. The concept of a system-response analysis was originally formulated based on the integration of individual reflectograms into a reflectogram surface, which is generated in a 3D cylindrical coordinate system. The use of reflectogram surfaces enables an understanding of wave propagation based on their velocity to a higher level than is usually the case with standard, one-dimensional reflectograms. Changes in the velocity responses on the reflectogram, shifting from a positive to a negative value, point to the locations of discontinuities and defects in the discrete 3D pile model, and there is a clear difference in the reflectograms, depending on the position of the measuring point. The study defines the typological models of the reflectogram: without discontinuities and defects, pile-head defect, defect in the middle of the pile length or a reduced modulus of elasticity in the middle of the pile length, pile-base defect or reduced modulus of elasticity in the pile-base zone and reduced modulus of elasticity in the pile-head zone.",

Field-emission-gun scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis of these residues demonstrated that the hopper ash attains an exceptionally high cation-exchange capacity and $SiO_2/Al_2O_3$ ratios (SAR), which correspond to the formation of major fly ash zeolites as compared to its counterpart.

The bending problem of a cracked beam embedded in Winkler's soil is addressed by means of an analytical approach. The solving of the corresponding differential equation solutions is studied in order to obtain exact analytical expressions for the transverse displacements of the simplified computational model. After the solutions for the displacements of the beam are obtained, the inner bending moment and the shear force distributions within the beam can be calculated, either by using known, established relationships from the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory or by implementing two mechanical equilibrium conditions. Numerical examples covering several load situations are briefly presented in order to support the discussed approach. The results obtained with the presented approach are then further compared with the values from huge 2D finite-element models, where a detailed description of the crack was achieved using the discrete approach. It is evident that any drastic difference in the computational effort is not reflected in the significant differences in the results between the models.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a new analytical method to analyse the behaviour of rigid foundations stabilized by end bearing stone-columns is proposed. The stone column and the surrounding soil are treated in axial symmetric conditions as a unit cell. The stone column is assumed to behave as an Mohr-Coulomb rigid-plastic material with non-associative flow rule according to the Rowe stress dilatancy theory and the soil as an elastic material. These common assumptions, combined with equilibrium and kinematic conditions, lead to the simple analytical closed-form solution for the prediction of the behaviour for rigid footings resting on stone-column reinforced ground. The parametric study is presented to show the effect of dilatancy of the granular material on the deformations and stresses in the ground and its beneficial effect on settlement reduction. The results of the new method are compared with some already known analytical methods and some published field test results and observations.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a 3D analysis (3DA) to evaluate the particle shape and size of silica and calcareous sands. The particles of calcareous sand are found to be less spherical than those of silica and crushed calcareous sands. Furthermore, the results indicate that the average sphericity (SPH) holds an inverse relationship to the particle size. However, in each sample the larger particles have higher SPHs than the smaller particles. In addition, the 3DA yields smaller particles than the sieve analysis (SA). Owing to a variety of particle shapes, causing particle interlocking, especially for calcareous sand, the particles cannot pass through the sieves by their shortest dimension. This paper discusses the effects of particle characteristics on the shear strength properties. Although the calcareous sand shows higher peak and residual shear strength properties, it tends to reach a lower shear strength at a small shear strain and a lower dilation than the silica sand. Moreover, the findings prove that the residual shear strength increases with the mean particle size. The sample with smaller particles shows less dilation under low vertical stress, while high vertical stress yields less compression. The relationship between the particle shape and shear strength properties is discussed based on the 3DA results.",

In this context, the threshold silt content (TSC) is determined from different laboratory tests based on packing density response (emax and emin versus silt content «Sc») and theoretical approaches proposed by several researchers in the specialized published literature using the characteristics of host sand and silt [emax(sand), emin(sand) , emax(silt) , emin(silt) , Gs , Gf and x]. The analysis of the recorded data indicates that the TSC derived from the (emax) curve appears more reliable than that obtained from the (emin) one. Moreover, it is found that the proposed analytical methods are suitable to quantify the threshold silt content (TSC) than that determined experimentally using the packing density (emax and emin). In addition, the test results show that the new introduced ratios [(D50s×As)/(D50f×Af)] and [(Cus×As)/(Cuf×Af)] determined based on particle characteristics (shape and size) appear as appropriate parameters for predicting the threshold silt content (TSC) of sand-silt mixture of the compiled data from the published literature as well as that of the present research related to Chlef sand, Fontainebleau sand and Hostun sand mixed with Chlef silt.",

    "abstract": "In addition to vertical axial loads, the footings of structures are often subjected to eccentric loads caused by the forces of earth pressures, earthquakes, water, wind, etc. Due to eccentric loading, the two edges settle by different amounts, causing the footing to tilt and then the pressure below the footing does not remain uniform. The T-shape is proposed as a footing shape for improving the bearing capacity of shallow footings against the action of eccentric loads. The vertical insertion of the rigid T-shaped footing, into the bearing soil, provides considerable resistance, against both of sliding and overturning, enough to regain the reduction in bearing capacity and increase in settlement. In this study, a series of experimental and numerical results from the ultimate loads and settlement of T-shaped footings are reported. A total of 48 model tests were conducted for investigating the effects of different parameters, such as the problem geometry and soil density. The problem geometry was represented by two parameters, the load eccentricity (e) and the insertion depth (H) of the T-shape into the loose and dense sand soil. After the experimental stage, the numerical analyses were carried out using a plane strain, two-dimensional, finite-element-based computer program. The behaviour of the T-shape footing on sand beds is represented by the hardening soil model. The results of the experimental and numerical studies proved that the ultimate bearing capacity of a footing under eccentric loads could be improved by inserting a vertical central cut-off rigidly connected to the footing bottom. The load settlement curves indicate that the higher load eccentricity results in a decrease in the bearing capacity of the strip footing. It was also proved that the ultimate bearing capacity values can, depending on the soil density, be improved by up to four times that of the loose sand case. This investigation is considered to have provided a useful basis for further research, leading to an increased understanding of the T-shaped footing design.",

The verifications are listed as the overturning, the forward sliding, the bearing capacity, the shears in the stem and the bendings in the stem. The heights of the walls are selected as 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 m in order to investigate the outline of the optimum cross-section and the effect of the wall height on the outline. Additionally, the physical and mechanical properties of the soil are kept constant in order to compare only the effect of the height on the geometry. The upper and lower bounds of the solution space are specified to be as wide as possible and the minimum dimensions suggested for the gravity retaining walls are not taken into account. A common feature of the optimum cross-sections of walls with different heights is to have a very wide lower part like a wall foundation and a slender stem.

Soil classification, modified proctor and CBR tests conforming to the relevant ASTM methods were performed on natural as well as composite sand samples. The laboratory test results indicated that samples used in this research lie in SW, SP and SP-SM categories based on Unified Soil Classification System and in groups A-1-b and A-3 based on the AASHTO classification system. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed on experimental data and correlations were developed to predict the CBR, maximum dry density (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC) in terms of the index properties of the samples. Among the various parameters, the coefficient of uniformity (Cu), the grain size corresponding to 30% passing (D30) and the mean grain size (D50) were found to be the most effective predictors. The proposed prediction models were duly validated using an independent dataset of CBR tests on sandy soils. The comparative results showed that the variation between the experimental and predicted results for CBR falls within ±4% confidence interval and that of the maximum dry density and the optimum moisture content are within ±2%. Based on the correlations developed for CBR, MDD and OMC, predictive curves are proposed for a quick estimation based on Cu , D30 and D50. The proposed models and the predictive curves for the estimation of the CBR value and the compaction characteristics would be very useful in geotechnical & pavement engineering without performing the laboratory compaction and CBR tests.",

    "abstract": "The compression index is one of the important soil parameters that are essential for geotechnical designs. Because laboratory and in-situ tests for determining the compression index (Cc) value are laborious, time consuming and costly, empirical formulas based on soil parameters are commonly used. Over the years a number of empirical formulas have been proposed to relate the compressibility to other soil parameters, such as the natural water content, the liquid limit, the plasticity index, the speciﬁc gravity. These empirical formulas provide good results for a specific test set, but cannot accurately or reliably predict the compression index from various test sets. The other disadvantage is that they tend to use a single parameter to estimate the compression index (Cc), even though Cc exhibits spatial characteristics depending on several soil parameters. This study presents the potential for Genetic Expression Programming (GEP) and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy (ANFIS) computing paradigm to predict the compression index from soil parameters such as the natural water content, the liquid limit, the plastic index, the specific gravity and the void ratio. A total of 299 data sets collected from the literature were used to develop the models. The performance of the models was comprehensively evaluated using several statistical verification tools. The predicted results showed that the GEP and ANFIS models provided fairly promising approaches to the prediction of the compression index of soils and could provide a better performance than the empirical formulas.",

It is based on the limit equilibrium method, but it uses some additional conditions for interaction between the retaining structure and the ground, when referring to the distribution of the mobilized earth pressures on the structure. The greatest benefit of the proposed method is shown in the analysis of structures of layered ground (heterogeneous above the dredge level and homogeneous below it), embedded in frictional and cohesive materials, and in the possibility of considering the influence of surcharge loadings on the active or passive side of the retaining structure. When analyzing such cases in practice, the proposed method gives results which are in better agreement with the results of FEM based elasto-plastic interaction analyses than with the results of currently used methods. At the same time, its results are in accordance with those published for homogeneaus cohesionless ground. Since in practice almost all retaining structures are erected in layered ground (heterogeneaus above the dredge level and homogeneous below it), the proposed method is very convenient and applicable for the analyses and design of cantilever structures under arbitrary geomechanical conditions.",

The aim of this study is to investigate accelerations, lateral (horizontal) and vertical displacements (i.e. settlements) due to earthquake occurrence. The results of dynamic analysis indicate that the performance of the dam is satisfactory for each one of the seismic scenarios considered in this investigation. The maximum settlements at the dam crest is considerably smaller than that of the dam freeboard, with maximum value of 540 mm, which is comparable to recommendation of the Department of Safety of Dams (DSOD). Depth of sliding surfaces is better shown in the Finn model, and the settlements based on the Finn model is about 2.5 times higher than that of Mohr model. In contrast to what is commonly accepted about earthquake acceleration (the increase in earthquake acceleration from the base to the top of the dam), it cannot generalize to all cases, and it can be limited to very strong dams or can be related to poor earthquakes.",

High squeezing ground is often present in underground constructions at great depths, but it is hardly ever researched separately from light and fair squeezing ground. A three-dimensional, static numerical model is developed for a complex underground structure consisting of a shaft, a silo, and a mine roadway at great depth, which is certainly in high squeezing ground. Furthermore, a solution for the entire structure based on shotcrete with incorporated yielding elements is provided. The yielding elements, in general, absorb the strain energy by compressing at a relatively constant stress, but without rebounding. A three-dimensional, static numerical model of a support system with incorporated yielding elements is established in order to demonstrate that the presented forces are under control. Therefore, a failure of the lining is avoided because the stresses in the shotcrete lining are below its load-bearing capacity. It can be concluded that yielding elements incorporated in the shotcrete lining play an important role in the support solution in high squeezing ground.",

These results were employed to define the extent of the fabric anisotropy in terms of an anisotropy coefficient, Ae, as a function of depth. In addition, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) were employed to study the fabric and pore-size distribution of these samples, respectively. Based on these investigations it has been observed that Ae increases with sampling depth, which is indicative of the alteration from flocculated fabric, at shallower depths, to the dispersed fabric, at deeper depths. The study highlights the importance and usefulness of the anisotropy coefficient, Ae, for determining the alteration in the fabric of marine clays, due to self-weight consolidation.",

If geological, urban and other data allow an alternative, the costs should also be considered as an important factor. In geotechnical practise, pile walls are especially used in excavations, in the erection of traffic facilities and in the sanitation of landslides. This paper is aimed at presenting economical differences between cantilever and anchoring pile walls and the impact of different parameters on costs. The optimization method, which uses mathematical programming, gives an optimal solution to geometry, self-manufacturing costs, and other characteristics of the structure in a uniform optimization process. This paper presents the optimization process using the nonlinear programming (NLP) approach for the anchored pile wall. The application presented only serves to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. Therefore, the retaining structure is situated in homogeneous non-cohesive soil at three different soil friction angles of 35°, 30° and 25°. The generalized analytical method, the USA method, which was first introduced by Bowles [3], isused in the application.

The samples were prepared at different initial void ratios and isotropically compressed up to 5 MPa. The bender-element technique was used to determine the dynamic shear modulus ($G_0$) of the soils at very small strains. The multiple bender-element probes were shot at different excitation frequencies in order to increase the reliability of the measurements. The $G_0$ stiffness was determined by using three different techniques: a) the first-time arrival, b) the phase-change method and c) the cross-correlation method. The systematic differences observed between the $G_0$ values, calculated using the three techniques, are discussed. The variation of $G_0$ in the log$G_0$ - log$p'$ plane was evaluated for the Bostanj silty sand and compared with other sands.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the two most significant types of deformation behavior fordynamically loaded, saturated soil. Flow liquefaction and cyclic mobility deserve special attention because of the large deformations that accompany these two phenomena. The submergence of a railway-line embankment due to the newly built Sava-river accumulation reservoir in Bostanj and the large landslide that occurred in the Stože area in the Julian Alps are case histories in Slovenia where flow liquefaction and cyclic mobility were analyzed. The dynamic loading caused by railway traffic and possible seismic activity were taken into account. Material from these two sites, silty sand and lacustrine carbonate silt, were used in extensive laboratory research, with the objective to define a procedure for excess pore-water pressure-generation modeling in dynamically loaded saturated soil.\r\nIt has been found recently that the change of the pore-water pressure is related to the dissipated energy density calculated from the hysteresis loops caused by dynamic loading. Based on the experimental results an empirical equation defining the generation of pore pressure during dynamic loading has been proposed. The equation is divided into two parts: the first part describing the residual pore-water pressure generation, and the second part describing the increment and decrement of pore-water pressure within the load cycle, the so-called temporary pore-water pressure change. The proper effective stresses and thus the stress path of the dynamically loaded soil can be defined by using the proposed energy-based numerical model.\r\nThe proposed pore-pressure model can also be used in deformation-behavior modeling. It was observed from the experimental results that after a few cycles of dynamic loading the saturated soil starts to exhibit a very low stiffness at the beginning of a load cycle, after which it begins to strengthen. The strain developed during this softening phase represents the main share of the total strain. The occurrence and duration of this phase are related to the energy dissipated during the cyclic loading as well, and the relation between the dissipated energy, the excess pore pressure and the short-term flow during cyclic mobility, give us an opportunity for a simple response modeling of the dynamically loaded saturated soils.",

A total of 8450 ovals were generated in a rectangular frame without any overlap. Four dense samples were prepared from the initially generated sparse sample under different confining pressures. The simulated results yield a stress-straindilatancy behaviour similar to that observed in sands under different confining pressures. The evolution of the different microparameters and their inter-relationships are established. When the confining pressure is relatively high, the difference between the coordination number and the effective coordination number is very small; however, the difference is apparent for a low confining pressure. The microtopology of the granular assembly at several important states of shear is also reported. It is noted that the topological distribution of the granular materials is confining- pressure dependent. The normalized void-cell number is a minimum under the lowest confining pressure, whereas the same number is a maximum under the highest confining pressure. A linear relationship is observed between the normalized void-cell number and the effective coordination number, regardless of the confining pressures. The evolution of the deviatoric fabric for different confining pressures is measured and the macro-micro relationship is presented.",

But in some cases, where the number of seismic stations in a local seismic network is very small, an automatic reading of the S-wave arrival is required. An algorithm for the automatic picking of the S wave arrival from three-component seismic data has been developed. Three parameters of the signal are calculated from these data and the S phase arrival is declared when the product of the three parameters increases above a reference level.

A good correlation between the unconfined compression strength test (UCS) and the point load strength (PLS) can be very useful because it allows for faster and cheaper testing than others with the same security to calculate the structures and performances of solid rocks. A preliminary step to implement the correlation is to have a good method to determine resistance to point load. This determination is quite correct if you have a sufficient number of tests on specimens of the same nature, but usually it does not occur and it is necessary to apply a size correction factor, F = (De / 50) α , with α = 0.45. This paper is based on limestone from Comunidad Valenciana (Spain) because it represents a very high percentage of their rocks. The implementation has been conducted over 700 field and laboratory tests of which 255 are PLT test, 45 are UCS test, and the rest are other parameters like: porosity and specific weight, Slake Durability, and ultrasonic velocity, among others.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of stress-strain rock mass behaviour is crucial for many engineering purposes. Rock mass deformations and their influences on construction are observed during construction and even during exploitation phases. These deformations in the exploitation phase are caused by the time-dependent behaviour of the rock mass. A flysch rock mass is categorised as a heterogenic weak rock that has been intensely subjected to weathering processes. Due to weathering processes, the flysch rock mass degrades from fresh rock to residual soil within only a few meters of the geological profile below the surface. Observations of reinforced cuts along the Adriatic motorway near the City of Rijeka, Croatia, were conducted over a time period of seven years of spanning construction and exploitation. Measured displacements reached significant magnitudes during the exploitation period as a consequence of the time-dependent behaviour of the rock mass. The paper presents findings related to flysch rock mass weathering profile and its characteristics based on detailed geotechnical investigations and monitoring results coupled with back analyses. It was found possible to detect the thickness of the flysch rock mass weathering profile by performing detailed geotechnical investigations. Recommendations for the strength, deformation, and creep properties of the weathering profile of a flysch rock mass are given.",

Then a single vertical end bearing and a single skin friction pile under different earth-surface loadings were analyzed and the down-drag force as well as the neutral plane location were studied. Subsequently, the performances of the single end bearing and the friction pile, with different inclination angles between 0 and 30o, were analyzed.\r\nMoreover, the sensitivity analysis was implemented using 2-D models. This showed a satisfactory compatibility with the results of the study of Lee et al. and Comodromos and Bareka. Finally, it was concluded that the drag load of the pile and the neutral plane position depend on the condition of the soil surrounding the pile, the 2D or 3D model type , the earth-surface loading intensity, the type of end-bearing pile or friction pile and the pile’s inclination angle.

    "abstract": "Granular materials such as sand are subjected to different stress paths depending on the in-situ conditions. For example, a granular system under the foundations experiences conventional triaxial compression (CTC), while it experiences plane-strain compression (PSC) in the case of the embankment of roads. Due to the difference in the stress paths, the behavior of granular materials also becomes different. This paper aims at comparing the behavior of granular materials under CTC and PSC conditions using the 3D discrete-element method (DEM). An isotropically compressed dense sample consisting of 8000 spheres was prepared numerically using periodic boundaries. The CTC and PSC tests were simulated using the same isotropically compressed dense sample to compare and explore the macro- and micro-mechanical responses of granular materials without any bias from the initial fabric of the numerical sample. Qualitatively, the simulated stress-strain responses are consistent with that observed in the experimental studies. The dilatancy index is found to be independent of the stress paths used in the present study. The b value (defined as b = (σ2 − σ3)/(σ1 − σ3) where σ1, σ2 and σ3 are the stresses in the x1 -, x2 - and x3 - directions, respectively) - axial strain curve has a close similarity with the stress ratio - axial strain curve for the PSC test. The evolution of the coordination number and the sliding contact fraction is independent of the stress paths. A link between the macro- and micro-quantities is observed and a unique macro-micro relationship is noticed, regardless of the stress paths applied in this study.",

The concept of a massless rock foundation is treated, for which a certain part of the rock is included in the model. The dam-rock interface was modeled by contact elements, which allowed certain relative displacements between the two media of different stiffnesses. The generation of the 3D mathematical model was related to the topology of the terrain, and the nonlinear dynamic response was based on the step-by-step linear-acceleration direct-integration method, making use of the Wilson-θ method. The convergence process was in accordance with the Newton-Raphson method. First, the initial static effective stresses existing in the conditions of the established stationary filtration through the clayey core were defined. The analysis was based on an original FE program for the static and dynamic analyses of rock-fill dams, as well as a FE program for the solution of the stationary filtration process through the clayey core. The dynamic response of the 3D model of the dam was defined for the effect of harmonic excitations. Dynamic analyses in the linear and nonlinear domains were performed for the purpose of comparing the results. The time histories of the linear and nonlinear responses were defined for selected sections and nodes of the model, the tension cut-off zones, the plastic deformations, and the stress-shear strain relationships. The coefficient against the sliding of the potential sliding surfaces was also defined. It can be concluded that 3D analyses as well as a nonlinear material treatment of the soils built in the dam are imperative for a proper assessment of the stability of rock-fill dams situated in narrow canyons.",

The most damaging earthquake occurred in 1917, when Brežice was hit by an ML=5.7 earthquake that had an VIII MSK maximum intensity. Seismic site effects due to Quaternary sediments can be expected in the whole area of the town. Since there is a lack of boreholes and geophysical data to assess the site effects, the microtremor (ambient vibrations) horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) method was applied at 113 free-field measuring points. In general, clear spectral peaks were obtained, but there were also examples of flat spectral ratios indicating a low impedance contrast between the sediments and the bedrock. A map of the sediment resonance frequency was drawn, which shows a frequency range of 1–15 Hz. In the southern part of the town higher frequencies correspond to the thin sediments (the Brežice terrace and the middle Sava terrace) and the high HVSR peak amplitudes indicate a great impedance contrast with the Sarmatian and Badenian bedrock. The northern part is characterized by very low frequencies, indicating thick sediments (Plio-Quaternary gravel) and a small impedance contrast with Pontian marl. The transition between the high and low frequencies is relatively steep. In addition, measurements were performed in 12 characteristic houses to assess the longitudinal and transverse building frequencies. The established building frequency range of 5–10 Hz indicates some areas in the southern part of the town where there is a potential danger of soil-structure resonance. Two buildings show direct evidence of a potential soil-structure resonance. According to this study, more pronounced seismic site effects are expected in the southern part of Brežice.",

Local site effects due to the alluvial soft sediments can play a crucial role in the amplification of seismic-wave ground motions. The shear-wave velocity (VS) is one of the most important parameters for determining dynamic soil properties and ground-response analyses.\r\nThe seismic surface wave method (MASW) is the simplest and a very efficient way of measuring the shear-wave velocity in the field. The Dynamic Probing Heavy (DPH) test is suited to determining the soil strength and the soil deformation properties. However, there are a lack of correlations between the shear-wave velocity and the DPH tests (VS - NDPH) in the literature. In this paper we present empirical correlations between the shear-wave velocity VS and the soil penetration resistance NDPH with: a) raw (original) NDPH data: VS = 97.839·NDPH0.395, (R2 = 0.723); b) a groundwater correction NDPH data: VS = 92.998·NDPH0.363 (R2 = 0.815). From the measured DPH data, the shear-wave velocity (VS), the shear modulus (Go) and the Young’s modulus (Eo and Er) were estimated. Two different approaches (low vs. high strain) were compared, and the results were found to be in good agreement when the relative difference between the velocities is small and smooth.\r\nDynamic probing tests are good for studying a discrete point of interest in a large field area based on preliminary seismic tests. The suggested correlation VS - NDPH can be used for a rough estimation of VS from NDPH (they are site-specific, and so not applicable worldwide). In this way valuable information about dynamic soil properties can be extracted for ground-response analyses and the study of local site effects.",

Currently available charts relating post-liquefaction volumetric strain to relative density were developed for clean sand. Estimation of post-liquefaction settlement of micaceous sands, therefore, may stay on the unsafe side, since there is evidence indicating that mica grains could increase volume change tendency. Influence of mica content on post-liquefaction volumetric strain of sand-mica mixtures is studied in this article. Soil samples were prepared at various relative densities. Influence of fine content that could be present in the field was also investigated on tamped natural field samples recovered from boreholes drilled in a highly populated alluvial site known as the Old Gediz River Delta of Izmir. It was found that increasing mica content at a certain relative density resulted in higher volumetric strains as compared with the data on clean sands. It is deduced that influence of mica grains on sand behavior depends on initial void ratio of sand. Effects of mica grains decrease with increasing of relative density. Simple empirical relationships were derived relating mica content and relative density to volumetric strain. It was also noticed that fine content accelerated and increased post-liquefaction volumetric strains.",

In this paper, we employed a newly developed diametric splitting testing apparatus and particle image velocimetry (PIV) system to study the tensile strength of compacted unsaturated expansive soil with different water contents and initial dry densities. Soil water characteristic curves of compacted expansive soil with different initial dry densities were determined using the filter paper method. Test results show that the tensile strength increases first and then decreases with increasing water content, and there is a critical water content for the peak load vs. water content curve. The diametric splitting test process can be divided into four stages on the basis of the plotted load-displacement curves: a stress contact adjustment stage (I); stress approximately linear increasing stage (II); tensile failure stage (III); and residual stage (IV). Under the same water content, the angle between the major directions of the displacement vector and the major crack decreases with increasing the dry density, especially when the fissure appears. Using the particle image velocimetry technique, the displacement and strain during the test process recorded is helpful for better understanding the soil failure mechanism.",

This paper presents a laboratory study of the influence of relative density on the cyclic behavior of Chlef sand. The experimental program includes undrained, triaxial cyclic tests that were carried out for three different relative densities (Dr = 15, 50 and to 65 %) with various cyclic stress ratios (CSR = 0.15, 0.25 and 0.35). All the samples were consolidated under one initial effective confining pressure σ'c = 100 kPa. The main results show that the increases in the relative density led to significant increases in the shear strength established by an increase in the number of cycles and with an exponential rise. In contrast, it was demonstrated that the number of cycles was decreased when increasing the cyclic stress ratio due to the shearing frequency. The two main effects of the studied parameters did not have the same influence on the cyclic undrained response of the sandy soil submitted to seismic loading: an increase of the deviatoric stress due to the high relative density that participates in the increase of the loading capacity of the compacted soils by minimizing the void ratios, and an increase of the pore-water pressure that has a negative effect on the liquefaction of the soil. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that these two mechanisms led to a global increase of the maximum shearing stress.",

    "abstract": "During the mining operations at the Velenje coal mine, groundwater has been presenting a constant threat to underground works. The hydrogeological setup is so complex that a lot of structural drilling and well-logging operations were needed in the past to clarify it. Above the lignite seam is a Pliocene and Pleisticene multilayer aquifer system, composed mainly of permeable sand layers and impermeable clay layers. In 1981 the Pliocene aquifers were divided into three packages. Based on the water-table data of each aquifer, pumping tests, chemical analyses of the groundwater and the geophysical properties the Pliocene aquifers directly above the seam, together with impermeable layers, were divided into: a) the first water-bearing sands (Pl1), b) the aquifers 2080 m above the coal seam (Pl2) and c) the upper Pliocene aquifers (Pl3). For the mining operations the most important aquifer of saturated sands is Pl1. The hydraulic pressure of the groundwater in these sands directly affects the safety of the mining. These aquifers are mostly affected by the dewatering activities, too. However, the dewatering wells are constructed in such a way as to capture the whole Pl2 and, somewhere, even a part of the Pl3 complex, too. The water pressure in this multilayer aquifer can reach over 35 bars, so a massive program of drawdown activities has been needed and is still in place to decrease the water table in the area related to the mining operations. Special, multilevel observation wells are used to monitor the water level. A number of 3D finite-difference models (FDMs) were used to estimate the regional groundwater drawdown. It was observed that the FDMs performed well when predicting the regional situation, but the model-predicted drawdown was lower than the observed values at observation points in the area where the dewatering operations using “drive-in” filters have taken place in the past. This is a well-known problem of the FDM: the drawdown being rather a function of the cell size than of the flow net. The risk of water inrushes will increase, especially after 2012 and 2017, when a series of surface-drilled wells, connected into the mine’s pumping-line batteries, will be abandoned due to excavation works and mining-subsidence effects. Consequently, the dewatering schemes had to be completely reviewed. The destroyed, first-order dewatering structures will have to be replaced by a series of “drive-in” filters, drilled from the mine roadways in the area of the planned longwall face operations. For the drive-in filter-system design the FDM does not seem to be appropriate. This is especially so if the error in the drawdown and pumping flow prediction is taken into account. That led, in 2007, to the selection of the finite-element method (FEM) for the prediction of the groundwater drawdown and the water pumping rates in the areas were the underground works will encounter the risk of a water inrush. Based on the FEM prediction the sizing and the layout pattern of the “drive-in” filters were made.",

The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) has been usually obtained by finite difference methods (FDM), finite element methods (FEM) and boundary elements methods (BEM). These conventional numerical methods still have some drawbacks. For example, the construction of the mesh in two or more dimensions is a nontrivial problem. Solving PDEs using radial basis function (RBF) collocations is an attractive alternative to these traditional methods because no tedious mesh generation is required. We compare the mesh free method, which uses radial basis functions, with the traditional finite difference scheme and analytical solutions. We will present some examples of using RBFs in geostatistical analysis of radionuclide migration modeling. The advection-dispersion equation will be used in the Eulerian and Lagrangian forms.

    "abstract": "A series of cyclic triaxial tests was performed on snail-soil samples with different porosities. The cyclic loading was performed with a Wykeham Farrance cyclic triaxial system. The investigation was based on a series of tests in which the following conditions were varied: the initial effective pressures (50, 100, and 150 kPa), the void ratio after consolidation (2.0–1.2) and the cyclic loading expressed by the cyclic stress ratio CSR (0.1–1.0). Measurements were made of the stress, the deformation and the pore-water pressure.\r\nThe results of the tests show that interdependency exists between the geomechanical characteristics and the porosity. These relationships can be expressed as functions of the density, the porosity or the water content. It is evident from the results that the changes in the coefficient of permeability, the coefficient of consolidation, and the coefficient of volume compressibility are non-linear with respect to the changes in the porosity. However, the changes at high porosity are much greater than the changes at low porosity, and the changes of the mechanical parameters, such as the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and the friction angle, are indistinct and almost linear at lower changes of porosity, and after that become non-linear.\r\nThe initial void ratio e is extremely high and the snail soil is liquid after consolidation; a volume strain of evol > 16 % is needed for the plastic limit state.\r\nThe chemical and mineral composition, the particle size distribution and the remains of micro-organisms in the snail soil are constants. In addition, the specific surface is independent of the porosity and the density or unit weight, the porosity and the volume strain are in the well-known correlation.\r\nThe performed cyclic triaxial tests show the dynamic characteristics of the snail soil and the influence of the porosity on the cyclic loading strength. The snail soil was recognized as a highly sensitive material. A large strain appears after the initial cycles. The pore pressure, increases already during the first cycle, to the hydrostatic part of the cyclic loading, or more (depending on CSR).\r\nThe damping ratio increases exponentially with strain, after some cycles it reach its maximum value, and after that it decreases to the asymptotic value. The reason for such behaviour is the large deformation. The maximum and asymptotic values of the damping ratio are a changed minimum with a void ratio. There is obviously no influence of the porosity on the damping ratio.\r\nThe shear modulus is described in relation to shear strain. The increasing of the pore pressure is independent of the porosity until it reaches some value of the pore-pressure ratio (>0.7). Similarly, the increasing of the shear strain becomes dependent on the void ratio until it reaches some particular value of the shear strain (>3%).\r\nThe deformation and failure lines for the different porosities are determined from the relationship between the shear stress and the effective stress at some shear strain, after 10 cycles.\r\nThe relationships between the shear stress and the effective stress at some value of the pore-pressure ratio are expressed in a similar way.\r\nTwo kinds of criteria were used to determine the triggering of liquefaction during the cyclic triaxial tests: first, when the pore pressure becomes equal to the effective confining pressure, and, second, when the axial strain reaches 5% of the double amplitude.",

The translational kinematically admissible failure mechanism generalized with a depth of h = 1.0 is considered in the analysis. The mechanism geometry presents a volume of rigid blocks composed of the central body and two lateral rigid bodies, which are connected by a common velocity field. The front surface of the central body interacts with the retaining wall, while the upper surface can be loaded by surcharge loading. The lateral body segments represent four- and three-sided polygons in the cross section of the central body; therefore, they define the polygonal failure surface of the central part. At the outer side, each segment of the lateral body is bounded by infinitesimally spaced rigid half-cones that describe the envelope of a family of half-cones. The numerical results of 3D passive earth pressure limit values are presented by non-dimensional coefficients of passive earth pressure influenced by the soil weight Kpg and a coefficient of passive earth pressure influenced by the surcharge Kpq. This research was intended to improve the lowest values obtained until now using the limit analysis theory. The results are presentedin a graphical form depending on the geometrical parameters and soil properties. A brief description of two world-recognized failure mechanisms based on the limit analysis approach, and the comparison of three failure mechanism results are also presented.",

The objective of the described studies was to determine the quantity and type of deposited material in the reservoir during the selected time period. For this purpose, the mineral and chemical composition, and the concentration and the particle size of the suspended load at the intake of the water into the reservoir and at its outflow were examined. In order to determine the concentration of the suspended load, 24 water samples from the area of the intake and outflow from the reservoir were taken. At the same time the discharge of the Sava River was measured. Solid particles were removed from the water with the help of sedimentation and in the final stage of water evaporation. The results of the studies showed that the concentration of the suspended material was changing in relation to the location and the flow rate of the water. This ratio can be described with an exponential function.\r\nIn suspended load composition carbonates, muscovite/illite and quartz dominate; however, chlorite was also found, as well as small quantities of plagioclase and organic detritus. With regard to the size of the particles the examined samples are classified as silt.\r\nIt was determined that the concentration of the suspended load, at the same flow rate of water, at the intake into the reservoir is larger than at the outflow. The difference is represented by the material that was sedimented in the reservoir due to the decreased speed of the water as a result of the river's impoundment. A comparison of the composition of the samples from both collection sites showed that at the outflow site of the water from the reservoir there is a somewhat smaller share of carbonate grains and heavy minerals than at the intake site, and a higher content of organic detritus and clay particles can also be observed. Considering the actual discharge of water in the period between July 2006 and July 2007 and the examined ratio between the flow rate of the water and the quantity of suspended and deposited material, the total quantity of sedimented material in this period was estimated.",

Furthermore, extending the mixed-type formalism into both of these elements by additionally interpolating the distributed soil-reaction field, the soil-stiffness contributions differ additionally. In this way four different elements are obtained, with one, two, three or four independently interpolated fields, in which the beam stiffness matrix is equal, but the soil stiffness matrices are different.

Some design methods have been developed to assess the performance of these reinforced structures, which are mainly based on the results from small-scale models and numerical simulations. However, the reliability of these methods needs to be validated under full-scale field tests. This paper presents a numerical and analytical study for a full-scale field test of the Fengyang high-speed railway embankment. The results were analyzed and discussed in terms of the settlement of subsoil, the stressconcentration ratio (SCR), the axial force and the frictional stress of the pile. They showed that the settlement of the subsoil, from both the finite-element method (FEM) and the analytical method, were in good agreement with the measurement, and thus was a reliable parameter to assess the performance of the piled embankment with reasonable accuracy. The SCR was overestimated by the modified Terzaghi method, with a difference of 25%, while it was underestimated by the FEM, with a difference of approximately 20%. It was also shown that the tensile force in the reinforcement could be effectively assessed using the proposed analytical method, while it was overestimated by the FEM with a difference of 44%.",

    "abstract": "The validity of some limit state solutions, when strictly applied to the basic corresponding state theorem (Caquot, 1934), is limited and valid only for simpler limit states, where stress vectors are either perpendicular to the boundary surfaces or when the direction of stress eigenvalue trajectories in transformation are preserved (Michalowski, 2001). The theorem of corresponding states allows us, in some cases, to attain solutions belonging to the limit states for cohesive-friction materials with the transformation of the known boundary of elasto-plastic solutions of limit states for pure friction materials. We demonstrated that for the selected kinematically admissible model, in general cases of boundary stresses, the indirect application of the corresponding states theorem in modified form is permitted.To determine this, we applied the kinematic approach of limit state analysis and used the upper-bound theorem for determining passive earth pressures. The results of our analyses show that incautious application of the corresponding state theorem in its basic form and for general cases is in admissible because the results obtained can be correct only coincidentally, depending on the boundary conditions",

    "abstract": "The 2,900-metre double tube tunnel of Trojane forms part of the highway section between Celje and Ljubljana and part of the highway road system connecting Lendava and Koper with adjacent roads. The construction of this section, which is of special importance for the Republic Slovenia, has been going on for almost ten years.\r\nThe highway near Trojane where the tunnel is located, lies on a hilly terrain composed of Permian-carboniferous rocks, which are tectonically badly damaged in some places and marked with broad fault zones, containing tectonically remoulded soil of low strength in terms of deformability properties. Even though the amount of waters coming from the hills during the excavation of the tunnel was relatively small, this water, in combination with extremely damaged weak rock caused the increase of deformations at the construction site.\r\nGeological and geotechnical surveying with geometric monitoring and the analyses of stress and deformation changes in the surrounding rocks and support elements were critical in assessing the actual weak-rock conditions during the course of construction. Since the analyses of deformation processes, which had been modelled with PLAXIS 3D TUNNEL PROGRAM, showed great impact on permanent stability of the tunnel, special care was paid to rheological changes in the surrounding rocks and combined in-built support elements.\r\n3D back analyses with SOFT-SOIL-CREEP (SSC) constitutive model, which takes into account rheological phenomena, were carried out. The calculations of primary and secondary stresses and deformations were made for two characteristic areas and determined on the basis of realistic geological mapping during tunnel construction. The first area represented typical rocks of the Trojane tunnel, i.e. shales and siltstone, while the second one was a tectonic zone where geological and geotechnical conditions during excavation were less favourable. The results of back analyses used provided an acceptable possibility for estimating the stress-strain variation during construction as well as an appropriate basis for analysing vertical displacements at the tunnel roof. The calculation results show good correlation with field measurements.",

In order to reduce the defect theoretically due to the related hypothesis, more rigorous constraints of interslice force are completely considered in light of static equilibrium conditions and energy dissipation principle of the interface between two adjacent slices. Without hypothesis of interslice force, the slope stability analysis is transformed consistently into a non-linear programming problem to be solved. So, a generally improved solution of slice method of limit equilibrium to slope stability is put forward. In particular, influence of the dilation angle of soil on slope stability can be involved in the method. The proposed method can be utilized for any slopes with arbitrary slip surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Structures are often constructed on slopes in hilly regions, which results in a lack of soil support on the sloping side of the footings. This causes a reduction in the bearing capacity of the footings. Though there are number of studies about foundations on slopes, most of these studies are confined to surface footings only (i.e., without the depth of embedment). Furthermore, there is no consensus in the literature over the influence of the setback distance on bearing capacity. This paper presents the results of finite-element analyses on a strip footing resting on stable slopes. A very large number of possible soil slopes with different footing depths were analysed. From the results it is found that the critical setback distance increases with an increase in the internal friction angle of soil, the depth of the footing and the slope gradient. The critical setback distance is varying between 2 to 4 times the footing width for soils with a low internal friction angle, while it is more than 10 times the footing width for soils with a higher internal friction angle. A regression equation is also developed based on the outcomes of the study. The developed equation is able to predict the influence of various parameters affecting the bearing capacity of a footing resting over the slopes. The results are compared with earlier experimental and numerical studies.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, installing piles using the press-in method has gained popularity in urban areas. However, pushing piles into the ground squeezes the surrounding soils and consequently causes a disturbance or even damage to the underground structures and facilities close by. In order to investigate the squeezing effect incurred by press-in piling, a series of model tests were performed. The soil displacement field was captured using a non-contact technique called digital image correlation (DIC), and the horizontal soil stresses were measured by mini pressure cells. Analyses of the soil displacement fields showed that the pile press-in process caused different soil displacement paths at different depths and locations. The development of horizontal soil stresses correlated well with the horizontal and vertical displacements. A thin disturbance layer could be observed along the pile-soil interface and it was about 7.4-11.1 D50 in thickness (D50, median particle size). At the end, the soil displacements caused by pushing the model pile with different pile shoes were analyzed and compared, and the analyses showed that a greater shoe angle resulted in greater disturbance to the surrounding soils. However, the influence of the pile shoe angle became less substantial with the increase of the pile penetration depth.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic loading or PDA test is one of the on-site experiments to estimate the bearing capacity of a pile. This test is based on the wave-propagation theory and can provide a good estimate of the bearing capacity of a pile as well as an assessment of the health of the pile. In this research, using the results of 100 dynamic loading tests carried out with different piles and projects, three types of artificial neural network (ANN) have been used to estimate the load. Initially, the perceptron multi-layer neural network was one of the most used neural networks. Subsequently, the neuro-fuzzy network is used in a combination of neuro-fuzzy networks and, at the end of the radial-based neural network, a successful network was used for non-linear problems. Between the different models of the neural network used by researchers, the multi-layered perceptron network has a better performance. However, other networks used have also proven successful. Finally, different models of the neural networks were compared and the network that has the best performance was identified in both phases. The models based on neural networks, unlike conventional behavioral models, do not explain how the input parameters affect the output. In this research, by analyzing the sensitivity to the optimal structure of the introduced models in each step, we have tried to partly answer this question. Also, the extraction and presentation of the relations governing a neural network model to the user is more reliable in the use of such models, which facilitates the application of such models in engineering works. In this research, four first indicators were used to evaluate and compare the models and structures.",

    "abstract": "This contribution presents the results of the analysis of permanent deformations of gravel in the Mura region under repeated loading. The purpose of the analysis is to forecast the development of permanent normalised axial deformations ▫$/epsilon_1^{p*}$▫ regarding the number of loading cycles N and appurtenant stress states during cycling loading. The analysis used the results of tests performed by ZAG Ljubljana and Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geodesy (FGG) of the University of Ljubljana [1]. The analysis considers five types of stonematerials of different quantity of crushed grains in the mixture and of different water contents. Four types of stone materials are mixtures of different portions of crushed grains larger than 2 mm (Dcr = 87.7 %, 58.9 %, 32.6 % in 0 %), and of the water content around w = wopt - 2%. The stone material with portions of crushed grains larger than 2 mm Dcr= 58.9 % is analysed also for water content w = wopt + 0.7 %. The results of the analysis are deformations expressed as a function of the number of loading cycles N, and a spherical component of the repeated loading p and a distortional component of the repeated loading q. The results can be presentedas deformation surfaces in the ▫$/epsilon_1^{p*}$▫ - p - q space for an arbitrary number of cycles N. The relation between the spherical stress component p and the distortional stress component q, at arbitrary values of axial permanent deformations ▫$/epsilon_1^{p*}$▫, gives a failure envelope, and the so called deformation envelopes in the p - q space. The failure envelopes and deformation envelopes are given separately for five types of stone material. The deformation envelopes are low at small values of the axial permanent deformation ▫$/epsilon_1^{p*}$▫ When permanent axial deformations grow, the permanent deformation approaches the failure envelopes. The failure envelopes for individual types of stone material agree with research results performed by [1]. The analysis of permanent deformations also shows their dependence on the portion of crushed material Dcr in the mixture of crushed and uncrushed stone material. The deformation envelope for uncrushed stone material is situated in the lowest position, regarding the portion of crushed material in the mixture. With an increased portion of crushed material in the mixture of crushed and uncrushed stone material, the deformation envelope is also higher, similarly to the lawfulness of failure envelopes. The relation of failure and deformation envelopes is mathematically established as a function of the portion of crushed grains larger than 2 mm. The comparison of stone material results for different water contents shows that a minimal increase of water content above the optimal one essentially increases deformation.",

    "abstract": "At the Orlica fault in the Krsko basin, combined barasol detectors were buried in six boreholes, two along the fault itself and four on either side of it, to measure and record radon activity, temperature and pressure in soil gas every 60 minutes for four years. Data collected have been analysed in a manner aimed at distinguishing radon anomalies resulting from environmental parameters (air and soil temperature, barometric pressure, rainfall) from those caused solely by seismic events. The following approaches have been used to identify anomalies: (i) ± 2σ deviation of radon concentration from the seasonal average, (ii) correlation between time gradients of radon concentration and barometric pressure, and (iii) prediction with regression trees within a machine learning program. In this paper results obtained with regression trees are presented. A model has been built in which the program was taught to predict radon concentration from the data collected during the seismically inactive periods when radon is presumably influenced only by environmental parameters. A correlation coefficient of 0.83 between measured and predicted values was obtained. Then, the whole data time series was included and a significantly lowered correlation was observed during the seismically active periods. This reduced correlation is thus an indicator of seismic effect.",

    "abstract": "Materials known in literature as Soft Rocks & Hard Soils such as claystones, siltstones, flysh, hard soils, marls, etc. received a lot of attention in research community in recent years. It was demonstrated that some of these materials can be described through general theoretical framework (Cotecchia & Chandler [1]), which takes into account the structure as an intrinsic material property that is present in all natural geological materials. The influence of the structure is manifested as an increase in strength and stiffness in a material. Based on a laboratory results and existent theoretical frameworks, a further step was taken with the development of a conceptual constitutive model for structured materials. A model formulated in strain space named BRICK (Simpson [2]) was chosen as a base model and was further developed with the inclusion of structure and destructuring. The new model was named S_BRICK and was tested on a conceptual level where the results of numerical tests on structured and structure less (reconstituted) materials at different stress paths were compared. The results showed that S_BRICK was able to capture stress-strain behavior typical for structured material and could be potentially used for the modeling of Soft Rocks and Hard Soils.",

    "abstract": "Retaining walls are proposed in many projects, such as bridges, coastal structures, road constructions and wherever lateral support is required for the vertical surface of an excavation. The active lateral pressure coefficient of soil, Ka , is an important parameter for studying the static and dynamic behaviors of these retaining walls. Many studies have evaluated this coefficient in static situations, but in most previous dynamic studies, researchers have worked on the behavior of cohesionless backfill soil or made simplifying assumptions (e.g., pseudo-static status) for cohesive soils as backfill soil. In this study, the size of the active lateral earth pressure coefficient (Ka) was studied in a full dynamic situation (Kae). A retaining wall with cohesive backfill soil is evaluated using the finite-difference method (FDM) and the effects of important soil and loading properties are assessed. The model is based on Mohr-Coulomb failure criteria under seismic loading. The results show that the value of Kae at the top of the wall, where it is highly sensitive to any variation in the soil and loading properties, is greater than one due to the high pressure value induced by the horizontal dynamic acceleration and the presence of tension cracks.",

    "abstract": "The swelling behaviour of expansive soils is significant in geotechnical engineering since it causes severe damage to civil structures. The swelling characteristics need to be well known for satisfactorily safe and economic engineering designs. A direct determination of the swelling characteristics requires considerable time and money, involving serious experimental effort. Alternatively, several indirect estimation techniques developed using empirical regression models available in literature are widely used in practice. These empirical estimation techniques have generally been assessed as a function of the soil properties, i.e., consistency limits, density, moisture content, clay fraction and type, and cation-exchange capacity.\r\nThis paper describes the dependence of the percentage swell (S%) and the swell pressure (σsp) obtained from a free-swell (FS) test and a constant-volume swell (CVS) test, and the primary swell time (PST), in which almost 90% of the swelling occurs as strain, which is considered as a new swelling characteristic in this study, on the hydraulic conductivity (k) controlled by a change in the gradation of compacted expansive soils. In addition, the rate of primary swelling (Cps), which is the primary swelling phase’s slope of the curve of percentage swell vs. log time, and the ratio of (Cps/k) were used to analyse their relationships with the swelling characteristics.\r\nThis study provides the empirical methods that can be utilized to obtain indirect estimations of the percentage swell (S%), swell pressure (σsp) and primary swell time (PST) depending on k, Cps and Cps/k, in addition to, or with, the conventional parameters. The correlation coefficients of the regression analysis, having high performance, and indicating strong relationships between the swelling characteristics and the indices proposed in this study, state that these empirical prediction equations can be used safely in engineering practice.",

    "abstract": "Deep excavations in urban areas impose deformation to adjacent structures; hence the reliability of deformation analysis for the real deep excavation projects is very important to be assessed. In this study a framework is presented for the use of reliability methods in deformation analysis of deep urban excavations. The suggested framework is applied for 5 real deep excavation projects implemented during last 10 years. All studied cases were recognized as projects of high importance in urban areas, and were monitored during the excavation process. A non-probabilistic reliability analysis procedure, Random set method, in combination with finite element numerical modeling is applied to obtain the probability of unsatisfactory performance for each case. The reliability analysis results are confirmed by field observations and measurements. Typical results for the probability of analytical deformations exceeding the acceptable values along with the site observations and measured displacements for 5 real deep excavation projects show that the reliability analysis could be a beneficial tool for designer. It is concluded that applying the suggested framework in the design stage of deep excavation projects may lead to design more appropriate systems compared to common deterministic design methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes research on the prediction of horizontal displacements and internal forces in an anchored wall for the protection of an excavation, using standard field and laboratory tests and a finite-element programme with a soil model that can simulate the key aspects of soil behaviour at a construction site. It is important to be acquainted with the constitutive model incorporated in the programme, and the selection of the appropriate soil parameters for the numerical analysis is a crucial part of the modelling. As a result, it is useful to carry out numerical simulations of standard laboratory tests with well-known soil behaviour in order to select the relevant parameters for the simulation of the actual construction process. It is shown in this paper that the measurements of the shear-wave velocities, which can provide the soil’s stiffness at very small strains, can also be useful for determining the static stiffness at a magnitude of the strains relevant for the geotechnical structure under consideration, for both cohesive and noncohesive soils. The research was carried out by a detailed analysis of a case history involving an anchored, reinforced concrete wall supporting the walls of an excavation in a relatively stiff soil. The wall displacements were monitored using an installed inclinometer. The major part of the paper is devoted to an analysis of the selection of parameters, especially the stiffness parameters. The simulation of the triaxial, consolidated, undrained tests was used in order to assess the reduction of the secant stiffness modulus with an increase of the relative mobilized shear strength for the hard clay layer according to the published empirical evidence. It is shown that by selecting the appropriate stiffness parameters for the soil model used in the numerical analysis, it is possible to get an acceptable prediction of the anchored-wall displacements. This is just one example of a successful analysis, but it is encouraging in the way that it shows how it is possible to make reliable predictions based on standard field and laboratory tests and with the use of an available computer programme with a realistic soil model.",

The method of limit analysis with a set of three-dimensional kinematically admissible hyperbolic translational failure mechanisms is used to determine the critical distribution of the passive pressures along the retaining structurecs height. The intensity of thepassive pressures is gradually determined with the mentioned translational failure mechanisms in the top-down direction. Thus, the critical distribution,the trust point and the resultant of the passive pressures that can be activated at the limit state for the chosen kinematic model are obtained. The results of the analyses show that the total sum of passive pressures, considering the critical distribution, is lower than the comparable values published in the literature. Furthermore, the trust point of the passive pressure resultant is independent of the friction between the retaining structures and the soil.",

To overcome this deficiency and to obtain the necessary coefficients of the pre-face part of the displacement function, the 3D displacement measurements ahead of the face due to tunneling should be performed. Such measurements were performed in the exploratory tunnel of the Sentvid tunnel during the excavation of the main tunnel.

Based on the results of these tests, a constitutive model for structured soils with initial stress-induced anisotropy was formulated. In the proposed model, the initially anisotropic structured soils are regarded as heterogeneous materials composed of bonded blocks and weaker bands. The bonded blocks (denoted as bonded elements) are described as transversely isotropic elastic– brittle materials, while the weaker bands (denoted as frictional elements) are described by the Lade–Duncan model of elastic–plastic materials. Based on the homogenization theorem for heterogeneous materials, and the introduction of structural parameters such as the breakage ratio and the local strain coefficient, the non-uniform distribution of stress and strain within a representative volume element was obtained. Finally, the parameters of the model were determined based on experimental results. The model was verified with test results, demonstrating that it can effectively capture many important features of artificially structured soils with an initial stress-induced anisotropy.",

The compressibility behaviour of soils islargely dependent on the compression index, the properties and the parameters of the soil.

The main objectives of this research were to study the relationships between the compression index (Cc) and the swelling index (Cs), and to investigate the effects of the natural void ratio (e0) and the over-consolidation ratio (OCR) on Cc and Cs, in order to combine them with the pre-compression stress (Pc), the consolidation duration (Tc) and the settlement (Su).Consequently, aconsolidation matrix and a consolidation circle are proposed, which gives us a new method and model to facilitate the calculations of the parameters involved in the soil consolidation, so as to summarize the consolidation phenomenon.",

The main objective of the deformation analysis is to confirm the stabilities of the reference points of a geodetic network, which are used to determine the movements of the control points that are stabilized on the observed objects. The assumption about the stabilities of certain reference points must be based on reasonable grounds, underpinned by measurements and proven by numerical methods. This is one part of the results of the deformation analysis when determining the extent of the movements and deformations. To do this a transformation is used in which a comparison is made between the coordinates of the points for two separate epochs. On the basis of the estimated transformation parameters, possible movements can be concluded within the reference points, i.e., on whether the datum parameters have changed. After confirming the stability of the geodetic network the coordinate differences of identical points measured within the different time windows can be determined as displacements and/or deformations of an object. In this paper one viaduct was assessed through geology and tectonic activities and also a load test of the viaduct was performed. The viaduct is in a quite active region, but the load test showed that the bridge response to the load is as expected.",

This paper reports two comparative field static load tests on an XCC and a CCC single pile of the same cross-sectional area. In addition, corresponding threedimensional numerical back-analyses are performed to provide a fundamental understanding. The measured and computed results reveal that the XCC single pile has an approximately 25% higher ultimate bearing capacity than the CCC single pile. This is because the XCC single pile has an approximately 20% larger total side resistance, which is caused by a 60% larger pile perimeter and a slightly smaller unit side resistance. Lateral soil arching effects are developed, causing a non-uniform effective normal stress and a shear stress across the circumference of the XCC single pile. It is suggested that XCC single piles have a higher efficiency in terms of material saving compared with CCC single piles.",

    "abstract": "The discrete element method (DEM) is an alternative computational tool for augmenting laboratory experiments because of its advantages in detailing macro- and micro-mechanical information. However, it should be noted that the DEM does not usually consider the convergence for each time step, because of the necessity for a huge calculation time. In that case, it indicates that the uniqueness of the solution is not guaranteed, except in the case of a very small strain rate, even though the behavior looks qualitatively reasonable. At first, the influence of strain rate among numerically imaginary input parameters for a non-cohesive material was investigated for monotonic, biaxial shear tests. Then, new findings were obtained from the DEM simulations. Strain rate has a significant influence on the shear behavior, especially after the peak strength of dense specimens. A quasi-static steady state exists, not a static steady state. The “strong” fabric ratio is closely related to the stress ratio. The maximum slip coordination number occurs around the phase-transformation ratio and the shear band appears around the peak strength.",

    "abstract": "The accurate predictions of load- deflection response of the pile group are necessary for a safe and economical design. The behavior of piles under the lateral load embedded in soil, is typically analyzed using the Winkler nonlinear springs method. In this method, the soil-pile interaction is modeled by nonlinear p-y curves in a way that the single pile p-y curve is modified using a p-multiplier (Pm) for each row of piles in the group. The average Pm is called the group reduction factor. The Pm factor depends upon the configuration of pile group and the pile spacing (S). The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of various parameters, such as the pile spacing in the group, different layouts and the lateral load angle (Ѳ) change as a new parameter on the Pm factor and group efficiency based on the 1-g model test. The Pm factor is well comparable with the results of the full-scale test on pile group. However, based on the results, the calculated values of the Pm factor for 3×3 pile groups under 2.5-diameter spacing was estimated about 0.38 and under 3.5-diameter spacing was estimated about 0.52, so the calculated values at S/D=3, obtained from interpolation the values of group reduction factor at S/D=2.5 and S/D=3.5, are close to the AASHTO recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Soft soils have a high compressibility, and low shear strength, and constructions on such soils often require the use of ground-improvement techniques. This paper compares the use of an electrokinetic (EK) treatment of soft soils using the ionic solutions calcium chloride and sodium carbonate. The effects of the ionic-solution type, the EK-treatment duration, the cation exchange capacity (CEC), the specific surface area (Sa), the pH, the electrical conductivity (σ), and the ionic strength (Is) were considered in this study. Examining the parameters and evaluating their effects on soil behavior are difficult and complex. The design of experiments (DOE) software program was used to evaluate the effects of the parameters and determine the significant input factors for the EK treatment on soft soils. The analysis and optimization of the data produced the threshold values using the design-expert® software. In this study, the EK-treated soil with CEC = 4.9 meq 100/g, Sa = 4.5 m2/g , pH = 9.5, σ = 6.0 S/m, Is = 1.55·10-4 mol/L, and electrolyte-type setup of CaCl2-Na2CO3 gave better soil strengthening. The gain in strength is attributed to the flocculation and aggregation of the EK-treated soil particles. The analysis of the data by DOE indicated that it could be used to assess the significant effects of the input factors on the unconfined compressive strength, qu of the EK-treated soft soils.",

The specimens were prepared by a new, remolded method at dry density and consolidated stresses. Tri-axial shear-strength tests were performed to evaluate the pore-water pressure and the shear strength. The test results show that the pore-water pressure increases gradually and is close to the critical values as the axial strain increases. In addition, under isotropic and K0 consolidation, both the c and c' of the soft marine silts were 0 kPa, which means that the silts do not have any shear resistance, just like fluid under a rubble-mound breakwater. Based on the linear-elasticity and the one-dimensional consolidation theory, the model of the settlement and stability was evaluated in SIGMA/W. The results show that the soft marine silts at the breakwater induced a displacement, greatly increasing with the filling rubble-mound loading. The figures and results can be referenced for a stability evaluation of the silt soil deposits under the rubble-mound breakwater. The results are useful for marine silts mechanics and a stability analysis for the planning, design, and related research on near-shore engineering.",

The characterization of physical parameters of marine sediments was based on research methods which permit to describe the parameters defining different types of sediment and zones of sedimentation; to determine fundamental parameters that influence the propagation of the acoustic waves in saturated and porous means; to define quick and indicative methods for characterization of physical parameters of analysed means.

The results of acoustic tests were compared to the grain size curves of the sediments and the propagation characteristics such as velocity, density, porosity and absorption of experimentally determined data. The analyses are based 011 various mathematical models presented in. literature, in order to predict and to describe physical mechanisms of the wave propagation using a simplification of the sediment structure. The target of the study was to determine a new mathematical law that linked the mean grain size to a directly measurable parameter such as the spectral amplitude, and to offer the possibility to obtain the first indicative value of the sediment mean grain size.

    "abstract": "Unsaturated soils are maintaining their importance for researchers and there is still much need to investigate the many engineering aspects of these soils. A new technique is proposed here to predict the variation of the bearing capacity of unsaturated soils with matric suction. The proposed method is an extension of conventional bearing-capacity theories and conceptually based on the logarithmic model of the shear strength of unsaturated soils, which only include one unknown, unsaturated parameter (the airentry value, AEV). The possibility of predicting the unsaturated bearing capacity of soils is shown by the saturated effective shear-strength parameters c' and O' and the AEV from the soil-water retention curve (SWRC). Considering the necessity of validating new methods with other researchers’ data, the proposed equation is tested using the published unsaturated experimental study by the author, in addition to some reported experimental studies on the shear strength for unsaturated soils and also a model footing loading on unsaturated sand under controlled suction conditions. The results of the study indicate that there is a good comparison between the “unsaturated bearing capacities” obtained via predicted and measured unsaturated strength parameters (ctotal , O) and also between the measured/ calculated bearing values of a model footing loading. Consequently, it is shown that, without needing complex unsaturated testing facilities, the proposed equation is capable of predicting the unsaturated bearing capacity for both fine-grained and sandy soils, requiring only one unsaturated parameter, which can be obtained from the SWRC or predicted using the basic soil-index properties.",

They are consecutively evaluated by the proposed three step procedure. First the singularity is extracted. It is further noted that so obtained integrals, after suitably chosen branch cuts and analytic continuation of integrands are introduced, can be evaluated by contour integration for an arbitrary number of layers. They are, therefore, expressed by number of residues at the poles of integrand and the integrals along finite portions of the branch cuts. The latter ones can easily be evaluated to any desired accuracy leading to a closed form solution. Some numerical results corroborating the presented approach are given.",

It is distincltly porous, saturated and in a liquid consistency state. Snail soil was investigated for mineralogical and physical characteristics in the Laboratory of Soil Mechanics, Faculty of Civil Engineering of the University in Maribor. Mineral and chemical composition, visual appearance, specific surface and grain property were determined. Physical characyteristics show that snail soil is saturated in nature, highly porous and almost liquid. Geomechanical characteristics were investigated for their interdependency on physical characteristics. A series of triaxial tests were performed on snail soil samples of different porosity, density and water content. Cylindrical samples of the height of 100 mm and the diameter of 50 mm were tested using three-axial testing apparatus. The results of the tests show that interdependency exists between geomechanical characteristics and porosity. These relationships can be expressed as functions of density, porosity or water content. It is evident from the results that changes of the coefficient of permeability, the coefficient of consolidation, and the coefficient of volume compressibility are nonlinear with respect to changes in porosity. Changes of mechanical parameters, such as Young`s modulus, Poisson`s ratio andfriction angle are indistinct and almost linear at lower changes of porosity.",

    "abstract": "The investigation on designing supporting measures for geotechnical structures consists of the proper selection of the input data for the stress – strain analysis of the excavation process and the selection of retaining measures. In the preliminary phase of investigation the area must be geologically mapped in detail, and discontinuities precisely measured, boreholes and their “in situ” tests listed and samples for laboratory examinations taken. The new method allows rock mass classification for different rock quality, from soft rocks to mixed rock masses, as well as determination of the geological strength index GSI. The limits for using the suggested method are persistent discontinuities in rock mass which lead to translation or rotation failure mechanisms, either in a single plane or as a wedge. In all cases where discontinuities play a significant role, the rock mass structure must be considered and kinematical analyses performed. In other circumstances, a rock may be uniform and reasonably isotropic due to the geometry of discontinuities and their mutual intersections. The value range of GSI is first determined in the beginning of investigation and later in the excavation phase by considering the disturbance factor D, which expresses disturbances caused by excavation methods and rock mass relaxation. The strength and deformability parameters of rocks of different quality are determined by the generalized Hoek-Brown failure criterion and applied to shallow and deep tunnels or slopes. Before the start of excavations work and after establishing the retaining measures, the analysis results are checked by monitoring. New methods include the determination of post peak strength parameters of rock mass after relaxation, and routine measurements. The newest measurement system however allows direct readings of displacements of the rock mass in both the elastic and post-peak states. With back analyses we determine the softening behavior of the rock mass and a possible need for increasing retaining measures. Such a design method enables the optimization of retaining measures and the reduction of investment costs.",

The goal of the static loading test was to determine the bearing capacitiy of the test pile. It was also interesting to determine the share of the axial load distributed on the shaft and pile toe. In order to measure the distribution of the axial force along the pile, a specially made steel canal was built in the pile before concreting. Inside this canal the strain gauges were distributed evenly at the distance of one meter. The strains were measured for each loading phase in all measuring points. The distribution of the axial force was assessed from the obtained results and based on the distribution of the axial force the shaft resistance could be determined. The unexpectedly high bearing capacity of the pile shaft made the obtained results highly interesting. In this paper, measuring methods and measuring results are discussed. Behaviour of the pile and the soil during the loading test were also modelled by axial symmetric and three dimensional models. The calculated and measured results show a very good agreement.",

    "abstract": "Coarse soils can contain flaky grains in addition to rounded or angular grains, along with a varying fines content. Depending on the regional geology, however, the mica grain content can be remarkable, reaching 30 % or higher. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that mica grains would affect the soil behaviour. In this study, soils of a delta deposit that are known to involve mica grains were examined. The river sand was considered as the host material and the mica grain contents were determined by means of the flotation technique. A correlation between the mica content as found using the flotation technique and XRD count numbers obtained using an X-ray diffraction test method for each soil sample was established. The standard penetration test (SPT) blow counts from various boreholes were interpreted from the mica content’s influence point of view. The results showed that the mica grains would reduce the SPT resistance at certain fines-content, host-sand, mica-grain combinations. The reduction in the SPT resistance as a result of the presence of mica grains might reach eight units at depths close to the ground surface. This influence is expressed by means of a dimensionless parameter (MCef); however, it diminished with an increasing effective stress and fines content. The findings of the present study show that the influence of particle shape on the overall soil behaviour deserves further study.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a new approach to optimizing the layout of the geogrid layers to achieve the maximum bearing capacity of the strip footing under different loading conditions (Vertical (V), Horizontal (H) and eccentric (M) loads) using a numerical method. To find the best location of the geogrid layers in the current method, the optimum depth of each layer is obtained separately, which was not considered in previous studies. The effects of parameters such as different loading combinations, numbers and layout of geogrid layers on the ultimate bearing capacity of the strip footing have been studied. The results of the analyses are plotted in the form of dimensionless graphs. For different loading combinations, the optimum layout and number of reinforcing layers have been determined. The results show that the presence of the reinforced layers, at the optimum layout, significantly increases the ultimate bearing capacity of the strip footing, especially in the V and VM loading conditions. The optimum number of geogrid layers was different for different loading conditions. Based on the analyses, 7, 4 and 4 geogrid layers were obtained as the optimum number of reinforcement layers for the V, VH and VM loading conditions, respectively. Also, it was found that the position of each layer depends on the number of layers. In this study, the position of the first layer from the foundation (u/B) was varied by increasing the number of reinforcement layers and the loading conditions. In the VM loading condition, the geogrid reinforcement effect on the bearing capacity is more prominent with respect to the VH loading conditions. The increase of the bearing capacity in the VM loading condition at the optimum layout of reinforcement (N = 4) is about 100 %, compared to the bearing capacity of the unreinforced soil.",

    "abstract": "In this study the behavior of buried pipes under impact loading was investigated by forming protective layers with geosynthetics in various combinations in single and double layers. For this purpose, experiments were performed using a HDPE pipe with a 160 mm outer diameter, which is frequently used in the laboratory. In the experiments, Geocell, Geogrid, Geotextile, and Geonet protective layers at a depth of 120 mm were tested by laying Geosynthetic in single and double layers and then tested under the effects of impact loading by using free-weight dropping test apparatus. In the experimental study, the protective layers' energy absorption capacities were calculated by using acceleration measurements over the pipe and then evaluated together with their costs. In the experiments with a single layer Geosynthetic as a protective layer, Geonet's most successful protection structure was a 72.9 % acceleration-damping capacity. In the experiments with the combination of double-layer reinforcement elements, the most successful performance with 88.0 %, in terms of acceleration damping capacity, was obtained from Geocell and Geonet's combination with a thickness of 1 mm at a depth of 50 mm. When all the experiments with single- and double-layer Geosynthetic protective elements were evaluated as an acceleration damping ratio per unit cost, it was found that the optimum application was achieved when using a single-layer Geogrid.",

The test results indicate that in the temperature range from 20 °C to 50 °C the water content can significantly reduce the mechanical parameters, including the strength and elastic modulus of the mudstone samples. In contrast, the Poisson ratio of the mudstone samples increases with the increase in the water content. In addition, there is little difference between the effects of an immersion time of 7 days and 14 days on the mudstone samples, indicating that the confining pressure plays a protective role on the mudstone samples.",

    "abstract": "In this research a series of experimental tests were performed to investigate the effects of nano TiO2 (NT) on the triaxial behavior of cemented clayey sand (with variable amounts of kaolinite). To reduce the number of experiments, time and cost of research, the design and assessment of the experiments were performed using the response surface method (RSM). The amount of used NT was 0-4 wt% of cement, and the amounts of cement and kaolinite were 3-9 wt% and 10-30 wt% of soil respectively. The consolidated drained (CD) triaxial tests were performed for the confining pressures of 100, 300 and 600 kPa. The results of these tests showed that the amount of kaolinite clay at 20 % has the largest effect on the peak deviator stress and friction angle, but the soil cohesion has an ascending trend at 10-30 % kaolinite clay. The amount of cement in the range of 3-9 % causes an increase in the peak-deviator stress, shear strength parameters and the brittleness index. Also, the use of NT in a desirable amount (2 %) causes an increase in the peak deviator stress and the shear strength parameters.",

    "abstract": "The traditional way of analyzing the behavior of shallow foundations is based on applying the load to the center of the footing, but this is not always the case in practice. The settlement of a strip footing resting on dense sand under eccentrically applied static and cyclic loads is studied in this paper to find out the foundation’s behavior in realistic conditions. During cyclic loading, the shear modulus of the soil is changed, due to which the stiffness of the soil and footing response are greatly affected. Under the influence of cyclic loading, in coarse-grained soil, the strain accumulates depending on the intensity of the cyclic loading. In low-intensity cyclic load conditions, the accumulated strain reaches a constant value after a finite number of load cycles. In this study, the analysis of settlement is carried out with the help of a numerical technique, based on Beam on Nonlinear Winkler Foundation (BNWF). The parameters, namely, static load, the intensity of the cyclic load (qd(max)), the depth of embedment of footing (Df) and the eccentricity ratio (e/B) are varied to observe the effect of the cyclic reversal of the load on the foundation’s response. Using the simulation results of 144 model conditions, an empirical equation is proposed to estimate the total settlement of the footing using Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). The analysis of the numerical results and a parameter-sensitivity study suggest that the settlement under combined eccentric static and cyclic loads is mainly controlled by the existing static load.",
