    "abstract": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several vaccines were developed and rolled out at unprecedented speed, and notwithstanding this rapid pace of development, the results from initial clinical trials involving tens of thousands of adult subjects generally indicated that most vaccines were remarkably effective and safe, with no major safety warnings noted. However, with more than 2 billion vaccination doses administered to date, reports of rare adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are beginning to emerge. In late February 2021, atypical thrombotic events following immunization with the adenoviral vector-based ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine were first reported, and similar events have also been observed in recipients of the adenoviral vector-based Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and the mRNA-based BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines. These manifestations of atypical thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following COVID-19 vaccine immunization are now collectively referred to as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Although the reported incidence remains very low and does not affect the overall benefit of immunization, it is also true that if left untreated, VITT can be debilitating or even fatal. Therefore, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview regarding the incidence, pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of VITT, as well as considerations for special populations, based on the currently available evidence in the literature. It is hoped that this will enhance awareness of this vaccine side effect, so that cases of VITT may be identified and treated in a timely and appropriate manner.",

    "abstract": "Background: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), largely manifested as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI and unstable angina (UA), is a life-threatening disease. ACS can be successfully managed by adherence to established clinical guidelines. This study aimed to evaluate current practices in ACS management, adherence to guidelines and in-hospital outcomes.Methods: This observational, prospective study was conducted at 39 centers in Taiwan. Patients with ACS (≥20 years) who were admitted to participating hospitals within 24 hours and provided written consent, were enrolled. Disease management/outcome data was collected at admission, during the in-hospital stay, at discharge and at one year post-discharge.Results: Of the 3183 patients enrolled, 52.3% were diagnosed with STEMI. Percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting were performed on 84.4% and 3.3% of the analyzed population, respectively. Median door-to-needle and door-to-balloon times for invasive management in the STEMI patients were 65 minutes and 96 minutes, respectively. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was prescribed to 88.2% of the patients acutely and to 74.8% at discharge. At discharge, beta-blockers were prescribed to 53.4% of patients, statins to 60.5% and RAS blockers to 63.0%. Overall in-hospital mortality was 1.8% and this was higher for STEMI patients (2.3%) than for non-STEMI patients (1.0%).Conclusion: Compared to the ACS management recommended guidelines, median door-to-needle and door-to-balloon times were higher, while secondary preventive therapy during the in-hospital stay and at discharge were suboptimal. There is a need to close the gap between the guidelines and the actual ACS clinical management in Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked, rare inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by α-galactosidase A gene variants resulting in deficient or undetectable α-galactosidase A enzyme activity. Progressive accumulation of pathogenic globotriaosylceramide and its deacylated form globotriaosylsphingosine in multiple cell types and organs is proposed as main pathophysiology of FD, with elicited pro-inflammatory cascade as alternative key pathological process. The clinical manifestations may present with either early onset and multisystemic involvement (cutaneous, neurological, nephrological and the cardiovascular system) with a progressive disease nature in classic phenotype, or present with a later-onset course with predominant cardiac involvement (non-classical or cardiac variant; e.g. IVS4+919G>A in Taiwan) from missense variants. In either form, cardiac involvement is featured by progressive cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, various arrhythmias, and heart failure known as Fabry cardiomyopathy with potential risk of sudden cardiac death. Several plasma biomarkers and advances in imaging modalities along with novel parameters, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR: native T1/T2 mapping) for myocardial tissue characterization or echocardiographic deformations, have shown promising performance in differentiating from other etiologies of cardiomyopathy and are presumed to be helpful in assessing the extent of cardiac involvement of FD and in guiding or monitoring subsequent treatment. Early recognition from extra-cardiac red flag signs either in classic form or red flags from cardiac manifestations in cardiac variants, and awareness from multispecialty team work remains the cornerstone for timely managements and beneficial responses from therapeutic interventions (e.g. oral chaperone therapy or enzyme replacement therapy) prior to irreversible organ damage. We aim to summarize contemporary knowledge based on literature review and the gap or future perspectives in clinical practice of FD-related cardiomyopathy in an attempt to form a current expert consensus in Taiwan.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ that produces molecules with important functions in the human body called adipokines. Visfatin can be secreted from various sources, such as macrophages, chondrocytes and amniotic epithelial cells other than adipose tissue. The main effect of visfatin is to promote inflammatory processes. In addition, visfatin has pivotal effects on the entire cardiovascular system, such as endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, plaque rupture and mobilization, myocardial damage, fibrosis and new vessel formation. Vascular pathologies in other tissues also mediate its effects. Visfatin changes in a similar manner to cardiac markers in acute myocardial infarction, and the most cited feature in research studies is that it may be a cardiovascular risk marker. Visfatin is therefore expected to be widely used in cardiovascular pathology in the near future. Visfatin has many target tissues and various effects that occur in relatively complex biological pathways, making it difficult to understand visfatin adequately. In this review, we provide comprehensive information about this promising molecule.",

Heterogeneity of refractoriness and action potential abbreviation resulting from spatially variable parasympathetic enhancement of the acetylcholine-dependent K(superscript +)-current (I(subscript KACh)) underlie vagal AF. Adrenergic influences may also contribute to the occurrence of vagal AF. Cholinergic stimulation may enhance ectopic firing from pulmonary vein cardiomyocytes, which potentially contribute to the occurrence of vagal AF. On the other hand, underlying heart disease modulates cholinergic regulation of atrial myocytes. Careful history taking in AF patients is important for vagal AF management. Vagal denervation may play a role in the efficacy of ablation procedures, but the results are conflicting. Specific I(subscript KACh) channel blockers may become the treatment of choice in the future.",

    "abstract": "Prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is an important issue in clinical practice. Causes of SCD depend on age, gender, ethnicity, and genetics. It can not be overstated that an accurate clinical judgment along with a diligent diagnostic work-up is essential. A history of prior syncope especially more than once, a family history of premature death (e.g., 450 msec) should alert a physician about the risk of SCD. As a rule, physical exertion is prohibited in any patient with active myocardial ischemia associated with atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (ASHD), and total revascularization as early as possible is mandatory for the prevention of SCD. Special consideration should be given to women with ASHD as they often present with atypical symptomatology associated with a worse prognosis. Other cardiac diseases such as various forms of cardiomyopathies, valvular hear disease, congenital heart disease, and electrical disorders such as congenital long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome, particularly in the young, can often be suspected. According to the each individual disease condition, the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be individually tailored. Life style adjustment and/or modification, medical therapy, catheter ablation, device implantation (e.g., pacemaker or implantable cardioverter/defibrillator) or surgical intervention should be appropriately advised. Molecular genetic analysis in autopsy-negative cases (molecular autopsy) is indicated for identifying the likely cause of SCD and this should be extended to the surviving relatives of the SCD victim for risk stratification, for reproductive counseling, and for taking preventive measures in the surviving family members.",

We investigated whether visfatin is associated with occlusion of the infarct-related artery (IRA) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Methods: The plasma visfatin levels of fifty-nine consecutive patients with acute STEMI were measured by a competitive enzyme immunoassay.Results: The plasma visfatin levels at admission were found to be elevated in patients with acute STEMI compared to healthy patients with normal coronary arteries. Patients in the occluded IRA group had higher visfatin levels compared with patients in the patent IRA group. Increasing concentrations of visfatin were independently and significantly associated with a high risk of IRA occlusion. The plasma visfatin levels correlated with the peak CK-MB and peak troponin I levels. The receiver operator characteristics curve of visfatin showed that a visfatin level of＞22.3 ng/mL was associated with IRA occlusion.Conclusion: In addition to the association between visfatin and IRA occlusion, the visfatin levels were positively associated with cardiac enzymes; thus, visfatin level may be closely related to myocardial damage.",

Statins have been described as the principal and most effective class of drugs to reduce serum cholesterol levels and cardiovascular events in patients with or without coronary artery disease. Since the discovery of the first statin nearly 30 years ago, this class of drugs has advanced to become the mainstay of cholesterol-lowering therapy. It was found during recent years that many of statins, positive effects could not be explained simply by lowering of atherogenic lipids. There were shown also to exist non-lipid-modifiable effects of statins called pleiotropic ones, which could be responsible for this additional benefit. The most important positive pleiotropic effects of statins are antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, and antithrombotic ones, improving endothelial dysfunction and others.",

This study sought to assess the prevalence of MetS, and its association with CVD in older hypertensive subjects in Taiwan. We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study of 3,472 hypertensive patients age 55-80 years (1,763 men, 1,709 women), from 38 sites across Taiwan from November 2005-December 2006. MetS was defined using the modified criteria of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Pane III, and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). CVD included a diagnosis of angina pectoris (AP), myocardial infarction (MI) congestive heart failure (CHF), and stroke. The prevalence of MetS based on the modified NCEP criteria was 73.13% (68.29% in men, 78.12% in women). Use of the revised IDF definition significantly decreased the prevalence to 54.67% (46.63% in men, 62.96% in women). Subjects with MetS defined by IDF, or both criteria, had significantly higher odds ratios (ORs) of AP, CHF and all CVD. ORs of AP, MI, stroke, CHF, and all CVD were all significantly increased in subjects with MetS based on NCEP criteria. Those patients who met the NCEP, but not the IDF criteria, had a significantly elevated OR for Ml. In contrast, those who met the IDF, but not the NCEP criteria did not have a significantly elevated OR for any CVD. MetS is highly prevalent in hypertensive patients 55-80 years of age in Taiwan, particularly women. Patients with MetS defined by either criteria have significantly higher ORs for CHF, AP and all CVD than those without MetS. Accordingly, NCEP criteria seems to be more suitable than IDF criteria for estimating cardiovascular risks in this Taiwanese population.",

In general, P wave morphology of surface ECG and intracardiac recordings are important in making an accurate diagnosis of non-PV AF. In clinical practice, left atrial enlargement could predict the presence of left atrial posterior free wall (LAPFW) ectopic beats initiating PAF; increased automaticity and increased trigger activity from the LAPFW might occur in patients with left atrial enlargement. Furthermore, female gender could predict the presence of superior vena cava (SVC) ectopic beats initiating AF; the gender difference in the incidence of SVC ectopic beats initiating PAF might be explained by the gender difference in female hormones and/or autonomic activities. Further studies are needed to define the exact effects of female hormones and autonomic tone on the SVC ectopic beats initiating PAF.",

Results: Twelve patients met the criteria for clinical diagnosis of TCM (0.9%). All except for one were postmenopausal women. The initial presentation was chest pain in 8 patients. Seven patients developed symptoms after physical stress. Although ST-segment elevation was observed in 9 patients (75%) upon initial electrocardiography, all developed T-wave inversion. Nine patients presented with a typical pattern of apical ballooning, whereas 3 presented with atypical midventricular ballooning. All patients recovered from wall motion abnormalities, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 4±10% to 67±6%. Six patients experienced complications such as pulmonary edema or ventricular tachycardia during acute phase; however there were no deaths during hospitalization or follow-up. Conclusion: The prevalence of TCM in our cohort of Taiwanese patients presenting with ACS was 0.9%. The prevalence was markedly higher in women. TCM should be inc1uded in the differential diagnosis of ACS, especially in postmenopausal woman following a stressful trigger.",

    "abstract": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) employs a miniature ultrasound probe positioned at the tip of a coronary catheter to emit ultrasound signal which is reflected from surrounding tissue and then reconstructed into a real-time tomographic gray-scale image. IVUS directly images the vessel inside, allowing measurement of plaque morphology, distribution and exact vessel composition. Recent technical developments enable processing of the backscattered ultrasound radiofrequency signal underlying the gray-scale image. Therefore, IVUS can now provide more accurate measurement of tissue properties than traditional gray-scale images by different methods of tissue characterization. Thin-cap tibroatheroma by virtual histology was a proved risk factor for future cardiac events. Clinical trials disclosed significant improvement in patient outcome and reduced complications by IVUS-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which can also provide more information in angiographic ambiguous lesions. 3-4 mm^2 for non-left main (LM) lesion or 5.9-7.5 mm^2 for LM lesion are considered the cut-off minimal lumen areas to identify significant stenosis. After stenting, in-stent minimal area≥90% of the average reference lumen area or≥100% of the lumen area of the reference segment with the lowest lumen area are IVUS-acceptable. In conclusion, IVUS is a powerful imaging modality which can provide more information before, during and after PCI to facilitate the procedure. Therefore, it should be used more widely in order to improve clinical outcomes and quality of our interventions.",

Methods: Patients who underwent cardiac catheterization for suspected ischemic heart disease and were found to have no hemodynamically significant CAS between January 2000 and December 2004 were enrolled. Provocation testing for coronary vasospasm was undertaken by administering a step-wise dose of intracoronary ergonovine. Coronary vasospasm was defined as a reduction in luminal diameter 70% during the provocation testing which was associated with angina and/or ST-depressive or elevated changes. Results: A total of 454 patients, including 193 with no hemodynamically significant CAS and no coronary vasospasm (control group) and 261 with coronary vasospasm without hemodynamically significant CAS (vasospasm group), were included in the analysis. The incidence of provoked coronary vasospasm was 57%. Patients with coronary vasospasm were more likely to be older, men, current smokers and to have a lower body mass index. The most significant independent predictor of coronary vasospasm was current smoker (odds ratio: 2.796, p＜0.001). No myocardial infarction or death was noted during intracoronary ergonovine testing. Ventricular fibrillation occurred during provocation testing in 3 patients (0.66%), of whom 2 required electric cardioversion and 1 had spontaneous recovery without sequelae. Conclusion: Intracoronary ergonovine provocation testing was not a risky intervention procedure for the diagnosis of coronary vasospasm. Current smoking was the most significant independent predictor of coronary vasospasm.",

    "abstract": "Background: Epidemiological and clinical studies have clearly established the link between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular consequences. All treatment guidelines developed in different countries identify LDL-C as a causative factor for cardiovascular disease and as a target for lipid-lowering therapy. Although it has been a common practice for physicians to prescribe statins for patients with dyslipidemia, there is little data regarding the effectiveness of statin therapy in Taiwanese. At the same time, the pattern of statin prescription by Taiwanese physicians has been obscure. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of dyslipidemic Taiwanese patients receiving statin treatment between Sep. 2002 and Dec. 2004. Clinical information and laboratory parameters were collected by reviewing the medical records. The objective was to evaluate the performance of lipid-lowering therapies with statins. Results: Atotal of 961 dyslipidemic patients receiving steady dose of statins were selected from 6468 patients. The most commonly prescribed statin was simvastatin (31.8, n = 306), and the most commonly used doses of different statins were medium potency such as atorvastatin 10 mg (93.4), fluvastatin 80 mg (96.7), lovostatin 20 mg (96.7), pravastatin 10 mg (84.1) and simvastatin 20 mg (84.3). Among the five statins examined, atorvastatin appeared to be the most effective in terms of lowering LDL-C levels across all CHD risk groups. The proportion of attainment of guideline treatment goal was inversely related to cardiovascular risk, with less likelihood in the high cardiovascular group. Only 13.5 and 31 of high-risk patients attained the treatment goals for total cholesterol and LDL-C level, respectively. Conclusion:Fromthis retrospective review, we conclude that despite the proven efficacy of statin in lipid-lowering therapy, there are still many patients not achieving their recommended LDL-C target levels. The percentage of successful lipid-lowering is lowest among the patients with highest risk (those with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes patients). There exists a big discrepancy between physicians’ perception and the true rate of successful lipid control in Taiwan.",

Several prospective, randomized controlled trials have proven its safety and clinical efficacy. However, most of these trials only enrolled patients in sinus rhythm (SR). The benefits of CRT in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are not yet well evaluated. Methods: Fifty-six patients who received CRT between 2002 and 2008 were divided into two groups, SR and AF. Baseline characteristics were collected at the time of implantation. Echocardiographic examinations were performed in every patient within 2 days before and 6 months after device implantation. Echocardiographic parameters, tissue velocity, and strain images were analyzed. Results: Forty patients were in SR and 16 had either persistent or permanent AF at the time of CRT implantation. Pre-CRT parameters showed no statistical difference between the two groups. Both groups had similar rates of clinical and echocardiographic responders. Six months after CRT, left ventricular ejection fraction of both groups had improved (26 7% to 38 15% in SR, p < 0.001; 27 7% to 34 11% in AF, p < 0.004). Indices of synchronicity (QRS duration, septal-posterior wall motion delay, standard deviation of time to peak tissue velocity, all p < 0.001) were improved in both groups. Conclusion: Both patients in SR and AF showed similar responses to CRT. CRT therapy should be considered in AF patients with persistent HF symptoms and electro-mechanical dyssynchrony after optimal medical therapy.",

However, the clinical usefulness of this sign as a diagnostic tool remains controversial. The aims of our study were: 1) to determine the relationship between subcarinal angle and echo-measured LA volume, and 2) to assess the diagnostic value of measuring subcarinal angle for predicting LA enlargement.Methods: A total of 376 subjects who underwent echocardiography between September 2004 and June 2007 were enrolled in our study. LA volumes data were obtained, and then indexed by body surface areas. LA enlargement was defined as LA volume index (LAVI) ＞ 28 ml/m^2. Subcarinal angles of each subject were calculated using their chest posterior-anterior view, and data were analyzed by statistical methods.Results: Application of Student's t-test disclosed subcarinal angles which were significantly greater in patients in the LA enlargement group than those outside the LA enlargement group (p = 0.0035). Furthermore, linear regression revealed a significant positive correlation between subcarinal angles and LAVI (r = 0.41, p ＜ 0.001). However, ROC curve showed no optimal cut-off value of subcarinal angle which could predict LA enlargement.Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the subcarinal angle measured by chest radiograph significantly correlated with echo-measured LA volume. However, there was no practical upper limit of ”normal” subcarinal angle which was efficacious for detecting LA enlargement.",

    "abstract": "Advances in cancer treatments have led to an increasing number of cancer survivors, but also high rates of short- and long-term cardiovascular (CV) toxicities. The number of new cancer drugs is constantly increasing, and the uncertain CV toxicities of these drugs make long-term care and monitoring difficult. Moreover, traditional type I and type II cardiotoxicities may not be applicable to all of these agents. Multidisciplinary care with expertise in oncology, cardiology and other related specialties is required to mitigate cancer therapeutics-related cardiovascular dysfunction (CTRCD). The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the main CTRCD, risk assessment, early diagnosis, and strategies for the prevention and management of patients receiving cancer therapies. There are still unmet needs for cardio- oncology researchers with regards to early detection measures, better treatment strategies, better follow-up protocols, and better management of CTRCD. Experts in cardiology, oncology, hematology, and radio-oncology should thus work closely in an attempt to foster patient awareness and research in this field, as well as call for support from public and industrial sources to initiate pivotal clinical trials to solve these unmet needs.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hypertension is the key component of the metabolic syndrome (MS). Insulin resistance is regarded as the underlying pathophysiological basis of the clustering metabolic abnormalities associated with the MS. However, some antihypertensive agents may influence the insulin resistant state and the propensity for the development of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is clinically important to determine the relationships between hypertension and other features of the MS. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of the MS in Chinese hypertensive patients. Methods and Results: Four-hundred and twenty-six patients, 210 men and 216 women, taking antihypertensive agents to control blood pressure were analyzed according to the modified Adult Treatment Panel Ⅲ criteria for the MS. The mean age was 65 years (25-95 years). The prevalence of the MS was 47.9%. There was a trend toward female predominance in the prevalence of the MS (52.3% vs 43.3%, p=0.064). Moreover, women had a significantly higher MS score (2.8±1.2 vs 2.4±1.2, p=0.002). The prevalence of abdominal obesity was significantly higher in women than in men (74.1% vs 50.0%, p＜0.001). The prevalence of high triglycerides, low high-density liporprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and high fasting blood sugar or treated diabetes was similar in both sexes. There were no differences in serum levels of creatinine, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-HDL-C, left ventricular mass, and the rate of proteinuria between patients with and without the MS. In female patients, those with the MS had higher serum uric acid levels than those without the MS (6.5±2.2 vs 5.6±1.1mg/dL, p=0.011). This difference was shown as a trend but not statistically significant in male patients (7.1±2.0 vs 6.6±1.7mg/dL, p=0.187). Conclusions: The MS was highly prevalent in Chinese hypertensive patients, especially in females. However, large-scale prospective studies are needed to verify these viewpoints.",

The strain, displacement, rotation, torsion, and twist of LV were calculated by commercial software for different segments of LV.Results: Hemodialysis produced significant decreases in body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, but ejection fraction did not change. The regional torsion increased from 2.I ± 1.2 to 2.7 ± 1.3 degree/cm (p =0.012) after dialysis, though the crude global torsion, longitudinal, radial, circumferential, 3D strain, rotation and twist of LV did not change significantly. The regional torsion correlated with the crude global torsion (r = 0.763, P ＜ 0.00I). The change of ejection fraction after hemodialysis was significantly correlated with changes of circumferential strain (r = -0.858, P ＜ 0.00 I), longitudinal strain (r = -0.516, p= 0.012) and LV area (r = -0.883, P ＜ 0.001).Conclusion: Assessment of LV contractile characteristics by 3D-STE is easy and efficient. The regional torsion, which could only be evaluated by 3D-STE is more sensitive to reduction in preload possibly due to deformation non-uniformity of myocardium in uremic patients.",

The mean durations of ECLS and hospital stay were 173 hours and 50 days, respectively. The 2-year survival rate was 96.3% in discharged patients without major squeal. The mean and median of the estimated total hospital costs were 39,845 USD and 39,262 USD, respectively. Personnel (41%) and blood product (8%) accounted for 50% of the total hospital costs.

Methods: 18 nonagenarians were enrolled. Six had medical management only (NM group) and 12 underwent PCI (NP group). Each patient in the NP group was matched with the next 4 consecutive patients (CP group, n = 48) younger than 90 years old and receiving PCI by the same operator. Results: The nonagenarian patients presented more chronic co-morbid diseases (p ＜ 0.001), acute coronary syndrome (p ＜ 0.001), and an LV ejection fraction ＜ 50% (p ＜ 0.001). Although the incidence of cardiac complications didn’t differ between the NP and CP groups, the NP group did have more non-cardiac complications (p = 0.015) and longer post-PCI length of stay (p = 0.038). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) did not differ between NPand CPgroups in the subsequent 6 months of follow-up. Of note, the in-hospital mortality, MACE and all-cause mortality were higher in NMgroup than in the NPgroup (p = 0.025, 0.004 and 0.031, respectively).

Wiwanitkit proposed a probable reason for the low incidence of dengue myocarditis, that it might represented the rarity of the cases or it might be due to underdiagnosis and neglecting to report. Wiwanitkit also concluded that such myocarditis was very rare and might not be fatal if early diagnosed and treated. However, in another report from Columbia, there was a high incidence of myocarditis. Concerning the manifestation of dengue myocarditis, Horta Veloso et al, reported that cardiac rhythm disorders, such as atrioventricular blocks and ventricular ectopic beats, can appear during infection and are attributed to viral myocarditis. Dengue endocarditis has never been reported. Indeed, the formed immune complex in dengue infection could not be entrapped in the valvular space, therefore, dengue endocarditis could not exist. Dengue pericarditis can be seen but it is very rare and in the form of myopericarditis. The pathogenesis is believed to be the extension of dengue myocarditis into the pericardium rather than circulating immune complex. At present, dengue pericarditis is extremely rare due to early diagnosis of dengue myocarditis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Enlargement of the hilar branches of the pulmonary artery, in particular of the right descending pulmonary artery, has been accepted as a sign of pulmonary hypertension (PH). To clarify its diagnostic value, we investigated the relationship between right descending pulmonary artery diameter (RDPAD) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP). Methods: In a total of 229 subjects enrolled, SPAP was estimated by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. PH was defined as SPAP greater than 30 mmHg. RDPAD was measured on a chest X-ray (postero-anterior view) taken within one month of the echocardiography. We applied two-sample Student’s t-test to test the difference of RDPAD between groups with and without PH. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between SPAP and RDPAD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was done to seek a potential cut-off point of RDPAD that discriminated between PH and non-PH. Results: Two-sample Student’s t-test revealed RDPAD were higher in the PH group than the non-PH group (p = 0.024). Linear regression analysis showed SPAP = 20.9 + 0.53*RDPAD (p = 0.047), which implied a positive association between RDPAD and SPAP. However, ROC curve analysis did not find any satisfactory cut-off point of RDPAD for predicting PH. Even with RDPAD value of mean + 2SD of the non-PH group, its sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, overall accuracy, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood value were 6.7%, 97.9%, 66.8%, 62.3%, 62.5%, 3.1, and 0.95, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated RDPAD on the chest radiographic film significantly correlated with echocardiography-estimated SPAP. But as a diagnostic tool, RDPAD was not good enough to predict PH.",

Outcomes in acute stroke patients with PAD and the value of screening for PAD in stroke patients are not well known.Methods: Hospitalized patients with acute ischemic stroke were screened by measuring the ankle-brachial index (ABI) prospectively. Clinical characteristics, medical histories, cardiovascular risk factors, and the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) were recorded. The Modified Rankin Scale and all clinic al events (including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and death) were recorded at 1 month, 6 months, and at study end.Results: A total of 158 patients were recruited. Forty-one patients (25.9%) had an ABI ＜ 0.9.

Since oxidative stress can increase PV arrhythmogenesis, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether aging may modulate the electrophysiological effects of oxidative stress on PVs. Methods and Results: Conventional microelectrodes were used to record the action potentials (APs) and contractility in isolated aged (age, 3 years) rabbit PV specimens before and after H2O2 administration. H2O2 (0.02 and 0.2 mM) increased the aged PV spontaneous activity rates from 96 12 to 108 12 and 102 12 beats/min (n = 9, p < 0.05), respectively. In contrast, H2O2 (2 mM) decreased aged PV spontaneous activity rates from 96 12 to 72 12 beats/min. H2O2 (0.02, 0.2 and 2 mM) induced PV burst firing (33%, 33%, and 67%) and early afterdepolarizations (11%, 33%, and 44%) in aged PVs with spontaneous activity (n = 6). In the aged PVs without spontaneous activity, H2O2 (0.02, 0.2 and 2 mM) shortened the 90% of AP duration. H2O2 at 2 mM, but not 0.02 or 0.2 mM, increased the contractile force. Conclusion: H2O2 modulates aged PV arrhythmogenesis, which may play a role in the genesis of atrial fibrillation.",

Essential hypertension is generally regarded as a complex genetic trait caused by multiple genes. The polygenic effects on blood pressure are modulated by gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Most investigations for genetic causes of essential hypertension were approached with candidate genes, and a few candidate genes, such as angiotensinogen gene, were reported to be associated with essential hypertension, though the reports from different populations were still conflicting. Genome-wide scans with multiple markers have mapped several loci associated with blood pressure. The loci reported were on chromosomes 2p, 2q, 5q, 6q, 15q, 17, and 18q respectively. However, to date, no genotype had been conclusively linked to essential hypertension. It has long been hoped that genetic research on hypertensive animals, such as rats, will facilitate our understanding of the genetics of human essential hypertension. So far, more than twenty loci were reported to be associated with blood pressure in rats. More understanding of the genetic basis of essential hypertension should be possible in the future and would be expected to help earlier diagnosis, more effective risk factor assessment and more individualized treatment of hypertension. However, the difficulty of genetic analysis for essential hypertension and the possibility of inter-population differences in genetic factors should be kept in mind.",

The survival rate of all OHCA patients is still poor and is estimated to be below 5% from most reports throughout the world. The prevalence of ventricular fibrillation as the initial rhythm recorded is lower in Taipei City compared to western countries. The lower chance of coronary heart disease in Taiwan may account for it. Those OHCA patients with initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation have better prognosis. The community-wide use of automatic external defibrillator was launched in 2000, utilizing the model of biphasic 150 joules of fixed energy. The survival-to-discharge rate of the OHCA patients has been improved after the introduction of automatic external defibrillators in Taipei City. The concepts of treating OHCA patients have been changing recently. The adequate quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, especially effective cardiac compression, has been proved to be the key to improving the outcomes of resuscitated patients. The concept of defibrillation first for patients with prolonged VF has been challenged.

The procedures were performed under hospital guidelines and the patients followed in the outpatient department for at least 1 month after procedures. The characteristics of all fractured Port-A catheters were recorded. The procedure-related clinical status was evaluated.\nResults: The most common location of fractured catheter tip was found between the right atrium and inferior vena cava (11/47). Forty-six of the forty-seven (97.8%) dislodged catheters were successfully retrieval by the transcatheter method. Only one patient received surgical intervention because of failure to retrieve a dislodged catheter. Most of the procedures were performed with standard vascular tools (loop snares and pigtail catheters). In out experience, more sophisticated devices such as grasping forceps, baskets, or flexible triple grasping forceps have the drawback of limited valve compared to loop snare and even carry considerable risk of perforation. The complication rare of this procedure was fairly low (2/47, 4.3%), only one patient develop hematoma at right groin due to concomitant thrombocytopenia, and the other had flail of tricuspid valve damaged by a fragment passing though the valve.\nConclusion: The most frequent location of dislodged Port-A catheter was found to situate between the right atria and inferior vane cave, where it was technically easier to be removed by the endovascular approach, with few complications reported. Therefore retrieval of dislodged Port-A catheters by endovascular approach might be the first choice of treatment because it is both safe and effective.",

The clinical manifestation of acute myocarditis has only rarely been reported. We describe a case of a 46-year-old woman who presented with cardiogenic shock associated with acute pulmonary edema following an upper respiratory infection, which was initially presumed to be acute viral myocarditis. Cardiac function progressively improved after serial management including intra-aortic balloon pump and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation but soon deteriorated two days after weaning off the mechanical support. The episodic high blood pressure, tachycardia and marked fluctuation of cardiac function during hospitalization subsequently led to the correct diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.",

This survey was designed to investigate the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and CHD in an Iranian urban population. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 358 residents (129 men and 229 women) of the 17 th District of Tehran, Iran aged 25-64 years old (mean 44.08 11.77 years) were assessed for ischemic heart disease (IHD) according to the Rose questionnaire and resting electrocardiographic (ECG) analysis by Minnesota code, and CHD risk factors (including serum homocysteine) were compared between ischemic and non-ischemic groups. Results: Crude prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in this population was 53.4%. Mean plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) in men was significantly higher than in women (P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in mean serum vitamin B12, homocysteine and folate between the ischemic and non- ischemic groups (P = 0.31, 0.16 and 0.51, respectively). Conclusion: According to the results, high serum level of tHcy by itself is not a CHD risk factor in a healthy population, but it should be considered for reduction in CHD patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Transradial coronary intervention (TRI) is a widely practiced procedure in Taiwan. Most TRIs are performed using 6 French guiding catheters. Use of smaller-sized vascular sheaths and guiding catheters may further decrease the incidence of vascular access complication, but demand more operator experience and skills in manipulation of the catheter. We report our experience in using 5 French vascular sheaths and guiding catheters for TRI. Methods: One hundred and sixty consecutive patients who underwent transradial coronary intervention were retrospectively analyzed. Patient demographics, lesion characteristics and procedure-related outcomes were recorded. Results: Procedural success rates were 96.3% in the 5 French group (n=81). 92.7% in the 6 French group (n=41) and 92.1% in the 7 French group (n=38), respectively. Four patients in the 5 French group needed to upsize to 6 or 7 French vascular sheaths and guiding catheters. Three of these four patients failed the TRI procedure; one patient obtained procedural success after crossover to transfemoral approach. There was a significant difference in the volume of contrast medium used (211.9 vs. 247.8 vs. 272.9 ml in the 5, 6 and 7 French groups. respectively; p＜0.001) and incidence of acute renal failure (0% vs. 9.8% vs. 5.4% in the 5, 6 and 7 French groups. respectively; p=0.024). There was also a tendency of less post-procedural drop of hemoglobin level (0.5 vs. 0.9 vs. 0, 9 g/dl in the 5, 6 and 7 French groups, respectively; p=0.09) in the 5 French group. The procedural success rate of 5 French TRI showed continuous improvement over the study period. Ninty-five percent of patients in the last quarter of this study period were managed with 5 French sheath. In the late phase of this study, 100% procedural success was obtained in the 5 French group, and more complex lesions could be managed than in the early phase (type B2 or C lesion: 86.5% vs. 56.8% in the late and early phase). Conclusion: Use of 5 French vascular sheath and guiding catheter for TRI is safe and feasible, with procedural success rate comparable with those using 6 or 7 French guiding catheters, and with reduced amount of contrast medium injection and lower incidence of acute renal failure. After a learning curve, most patients can be managed with 5 Fr sheath and guiding catheter with a high success rate.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the role of an intragraft pressure-guided technique (IGT) for salvaging thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs).Methods: Ninety hemodialysis patients with acutely thrombosed AVGs were randomized into two groups: 1) the intragraft pressure-guided technique (IGT) group, and 2) the angiography-guided technique (AGT) group. In IGT, treatment sites were identified by a balloon pullback method, and then selected according to intragraft pressure (IGP) obtained after effective thrombectomy. Whenever possible, IGP was stabilized at 50-100 mmHg by performing outflow and inflow treatments, in case IGP was greater than 100 mmHg and IGP smaller than 50 mmHg, respectively. All AGT treatments were guided by angiography, and technical success was determined by angiography as well. To further ensure the integrity of this study, operating physicians were blinded to technical endpoints.Results: Comparisons of IGT and AGT showed that IGT required significantly fewer angiograms (4.7±1.9 versus 13.1±3.6; p ＜ 0.0001), fewer total angiographic frames (378.0±168.5 versus 1504.6±407.1; p ＜ 0.0001), and shorter procedure time (60.1±20.5 versus 106.3±30.1 minutes; p ＜ 0.0001) with a low complication rate (4.4%) and a high success rate (93.3%). Final IGP is useful in predicting 3-month patency (AUC = 0.77). Patients with final IGP below 80 mmHg compared to those with IGP above 80 mmHg had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of patency at 3 months (72.7% versus 39.1%; p = 0.007 by log-rank test).Conclusion: The IGT is a safe and effective technique that may reduce the need for angiography and shorten the procedure time necessary to salvage AVGs. Final IGP may predict the post-salvage 3-month patency.",

However, it has 110t beel1 well-documented the extent to which systolic blood pressure predicts metabolic syndrome in male adolescents.Methods: We retrospectively studied a total of 614 male adolescents 10 to 15 years of age who received a health examination at a private health screening center from 1999 to 2008 (mean follow-up lime is 2.71years). These examinations included anthropometric, blood pressure, and biochemical measurements such as fasting plasma glucose and lipid profiles. All subjects were normotensive and refrained from taking any medications known to affect MetS components. Only adolescent boys were included in this study because the incidence of MetS for girls in this cohort was considered too low to perform further analysis. We divided our subjects into 3 groups according to base line SBP. Multivariate linear regression analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify the association of anthropometric parameters with the SBP at baseline.Results: Among 614 subjects, the incidence of metabolic syndrome in boys is 3.1%. Boys with baseline SBP≧120 mmHg have a higher risk of developing MetS than boys with baseline SBP ＜ 110 mmHg (odds ratio: 3 1.78; 95% confidence interval for the difference = 4.16-243.07, P ＜ 0.00 1). Age, waist circumference, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, low serum high-density lipoprolein-cho1esterol and high triglyceride correlated significantly with base line SBP (p ＜ 0.001). Among all the parameters, body mass index had the strongest association with base line SBP in male adolescents. Waist circumference was the strongest independent contributor to base line SBP in male adolescents.Conclusion: SBP in male adolescents is an independent predictor for metabolic syndrome in male adolescents and could be included in routine metabolic risk assessment.",

Methods:Non-diabetic patients with either treated or untreated essential hypertension were evaluated if their office systolic BP (SBP) 140 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) 90 mmHg. Serial studies including serum biochemistry, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), and brachial artery ultrasound were conducted. Results: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled into the study.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (CM) is a novel heart syndrome characterized by transient and severe left ventricular (LV) apical ballooning and basal hyperkinesias in acute stage. Because the shape of the LV resembles a round bottom and narrow neck bottle used in Japan for trapping octopus, the disease is called takotsubo CM, derived from the Japanese words tako, meaning octopus, and tsubo, meaning bottle. Doctors also call this disease ampulla or amphora CM. At present, due to the results from many studies the most likely mechanism for this syndrome is activated myocardial adrenergic nervous system stimulated by acute and marked stress in this particular group of patients, with discrepant adrenergic innervations distributed in the apex of LV triggers for this novel cardiac syndrome. In the face of establishing a completely novel disease or syndrome, the diagnostic criteria should be strict, the definition should be narrow sense and it should conclude with gene study. Kawai et al and the Takotsubo CM Study Group in Japan established the first set of guidelines for diagnosis of takotsubo CM and published them in 2007 in the official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society, Circulation Journal, including definition, exclusion criteria and references for diagnosis. The definition of takotsubo CM is a disease exhibiting an acute LV apical ballooning of unknown cause. There is nearly complete resolution of the apical akinesis in the majority of patients within a month. The contraction abnormality occurs mainly in the LV, but involvement of the right ventricle is observed in some cases. A dynamic obstruction of the LV outflow tract with pressure gradient difference, acceleration of blood flow, or systolic cardiac murmurs is also observed. Similar features with known cause should be excluded, i.e., significant organic stenosis or spasm of a coronary artery by emergent coronary angiogram (CAG), cerebrovascular disease, pheochromocytoma, and myocarditis. Patients with known cause such as acute cerebrovascular disease who have an apical systolic ballooning similar to that in takotsubo CM are diagnosed as “cerebrovascular disease with takotsubo-like myocardial dysfunction”. References for diagnosis are as follows: (1) Symptoms: chest pain and dyspnea similar to those in acute coronary syndrome, but it can occur without symptoms; (2) Triggers: emotional or physical stress with predominantly emotional stress in females and physical stress in males, but it can also occur without any apparent trigger; (3) Age and gender difference: higher incidence in elderly females, 7-fold that of males; (4) Ventricular morphology: apical ballooning is seen on LV angiography and echocardiography with rapid improvement; (5) Electrocardiogram (ECG): ST-segment elevations might be observed immediately after the onset. ST-segment elevation persisted for several days in typical cases of takotsubo CM with a longer duration than that in the case of coronary spasm. The ST-segment elevations in Takotsubo CM usually occur in leads V3~6 and often show concave in shape and are lack of reciprocal changes followed by T wave inversion and usually resolve in approximately 2-3 weeks. The T-wave becomes progressively more negative in multiple leads with even giant negative T-wave change and with QT interval prolongation. These changes improve gradually, but the negative T-wave may continue for several months. Abnormal Q wave and QRS voltage changes are not usually seen. However, during the acute stage, abnormal Q-waves and changes in the QRS voltage might be observed; (6) Cardiac biomarkers: in a typical case, there is modest elevation of serum level",

Microelectrode recordings in intact tissue preparations and patch clamps in isolated single myocytes provide abundant information about the action potential morphology and pharmacological interventions in cardiomyocytes. Microelectrode recording, an easily learned procedure, can record the action potential with a longer period and avoid the impact due to isolation procedure. However, cellular interactions and complex electrograms from microelectrode recordings may interfere with the data interpretation. In contrast, single-cell recordings provide more direvidence of action potential and ionic data from current-clamp and voltage-clamp recording. The action potential morphology is caused by the balance of inward and outward currents. Nevertheless, the isolation procedure, cell cu1ture condition and rather short recording period make single-cell recording different from in vivo situations. Through the patch clamp, we can study the ionic mechanism underlying the pacemaker activity of single myocytes. This useful information provides the opportunity to investigate mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmia and develop potential anti-arrhythmia agents.",

Thus far, there had been 22 patients with pulmonary embolism treated with tenecteplase. However, none of the patients was treated during peripartum period. We report its use in a 35-year-old multiparous woman who was referred at 4 hours post partum with cardiogenic shock. She was clinically suspected to have acute pulmonary embolism, and this was confirmed by computed tomography of the pulmonary artery. She was successfully thrombolysed with tenecteplase but suffered bleeding complication. She was resuscitated and remained stable until discharge 1 week later. A repeat computed tomography of the pulmonary artery at day 4 post-thrombolysis showed a significant reduction in the thrombus load. This case illustrates the potential benefit and efficacy of tenecteplase in acute pulmonary embolism in peri-partum women.",

Three days after operation, surviving Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into four groups: MI, Sham, MI+PE, and Sham+PE group. Physiological buffered saline (1 ml/kg) or PE (0.65 mg/kg) were injected into the peritoneal cavity every day for 8 weeks, respectively. Twelve weeks after treatment, p-ATM/ATR substrate and p-Akt expression in myocardium around the infarcted regions were detected by Western blot.Results: Twelve weeks after treatment, p-ATM/ATR substrate and p-Akt expression were detected through Western blot in myocardium around the infarcted regions. The intensity (represented as normalized integrated optical density, IOD) for p-ATM/ATR substrate and p-Akt were (0.59±0.07 and 0.68±0.03) in the MI group, (0.63±0.05 and 0.72±0.04) in the Sham group, (0.99±0.07 and 1.03±0.05) in the MI+PE group and (0.65±0.04 and 0.75±0.04) in the Sham+PE group, respectively. Both presented with significantly increased expression in the MI+PE group as compared with the Sharn+PE group (p＜0.05); and in the MI+PE group as compared with the MI group (p＜0.05). No difference was observed between the MI and Sham groups, or between the Sham+PE and Sham groups (p＞0.05).Conclusion: PE can significantly up-regulate p-ATM/ATR substrate and p-Akt expression and thus might activate ATM/ATR substrate/Akt pathway in myocardium around the infarcted regions. The activated ATM/ATR substrate/Akt pathway might be associated with the attenuation of post-infarction cardiac remodeling, fibrosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure induced by PE.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although coronary artery bypass grafting remains the standard treatment for unprotected left main (LM) coronary artery disease, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the use of stent has become an alternative treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the real-world results of patients with LM disease treated with PCI and compare the impact of significant right coronary artery (RCA) disease on the short-term and long-term outcomes of these patients. Methods and Results: A total of 164 patients were included, with 95 patients (57.9%) with significant RCA stenosis and 69(42.1%) patients without, and were followed tip over a mean period of 2.5 years. EuroSCORE≥6 was noted in 78 patients (47.6%). Within the 30-day period after index procedure, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were observed in 16 (9.9%) patients, including 15 (9.3%) deaths, and 1 non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.6%). Three patients suffered from probable sub-acute stent thrombosis (1.8%). In the stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis, female gender, left ventricular ejection fraction ＜40% and RCA disease were identified as the significant independent predictors of 30-day deaths and MACE. As for the long-term outcomes, the mean follow-up period was 2.5 years (range 1 month to 9.7 years, median 23.4 months). There were 38 deaths (23.6%), and 57 MACE (35.4%). The survival of LM patients with RCA disease remained worse than that of those without (p＜0.01), and concomitant RCA disease remained significant prognostic predictor after being adjusted by other variables. Conclusion: In this real-world practice in a single center, we found that unprotected LM stenting in patients with concomitant significant stenosis of RCA may be associated with worse early and long-term outcomes compared with those without RCA disease.",

This study was designed to elucidate the relationship between the RR (subscript p)/RR(subscript pp) ratio and LV function, and to identify factors which influence the relationship.Methods: Beat-to-beat variation of LV function was determined by biplane Simpson's ejection fraction (EF) over 20 beats in 120 patients with chronic AF. The relationship of normalized EF (y) versus the RR (subscript p)/RR (subscript pp) ratio (x) were analyzed by the regression equation y = a + bx. The relation-slope b describes the steepness of the relationship and is a measure of the sensitivity of LV function to ventricular cycle-length irregularity.Results: Mean EF and mean heart rate were factors affecting the relation slope. Negative correlations between mean EF and the relation slope were similarly present at faster heart rates (≧ 80/min， r=-0.81, p ＜ 0.001) and slower heart rates (＜ 80/min, r = -0.85, p ＜ 0.001). A steeper relationship with faster heart rates was present in patients with normal LV function (r = 0.67, P ＜ 0.001) but not in patients with LV dysfunction (r= 0.23, P = 0.09).Conclusion: Beat-to-beat variation of LV systolic function (LV EF) is more sensitive to ventricular cycle-length irregularity during AF in patients with lower EF or higher heart rate.",

Adiponectin is an abundant plasma protein secreted from adipocytes that elicits protective effects in the vasculature and myocardium. We therefore hypothesized that AngII may induce the expression of adiponectin in cultured human cardiomyocytes (HCM), and adiponectin expression could perhaps be modified by angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) irbesartan.Methods: The HCM were stimulated either with or without AngII, and the inhibitory effects of irbesartan on adiponectin expression were tested. The levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) proteins induced by AngII, and the effects of specific inhibition on the ERK, p38, and JNK pathways on the AngII-induced adiponectin protein expression were also tested.Results: AngII dose-dependently induced adiponectin expression in HCM. Pretreatment with irbesartan significantly blocked the increase of adiponectin protein by the AngII. AngII significantly increased phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and JNK, while PD98059, SB205380, and SP600125 attenuated the phosphorylation of the 3 signaling pathways, respectively, and adiponectin expression induced by AngII.Conclusion: Our study revealed that AngII enhances adiponectin expression in cultured HCM, probably mediated through the ERK, p38, and JNK pathways. The use of ARB irbesartan can inhibit the AngII-induced adiponectin expression.",

However, the effect of statin on myocardin expression due to pressure overloaded cardiac hypertrophy is not well understood.Methods: To evaluate the effect of statin on myocardin expression and cardiac hypertrophy, infrarenal aortic banding was performed for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Atorvastatin (30 mg/kg), valsartan (30 mg/kg), N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 250 mg/kg), and the above three agents combined were given daily after surgery.Results: After aortic banding for 4 weeks, the heart weight, the ratio of heart/body weight, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased significantly. However, echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy after aortic banding. Elevated MAP and increased wall thickness and heart weight were reversed after treatment with atorvastatin, valsartan, NAC, and a combination of the three agents. Myocardin, myosin heavy chain (MHC), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins, myocardin mRNA, angiotensin II (AngII), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expressions were up-regulated in the banding group, which were inhibited by atorvastatin, valsartan, NAC, and the three agents combined. Increased immunohistochemical labelings of myocardin and MHC in the ventricular myocardium were observed in the banding group, and again atorvastatin, valsartan, or NAC reversed the labelings.Conclusion: Myocardin, MHC, BNP proteins, myocardin mRNA, AngII, and SOD expressions were up-regulated in the rat model of pressure-overloaded cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment with atorvastatin, valsartan, NAC, or three agents put together is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of myocardin in the hypertrophic myocardium.",

    "abstract": "Despite monumental progress in both molecular and interventional cardiology, atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the US, claiming more lives than the next 7 causes of mortality combined. Not only is this chronic disease the beginning of many familiar downstream clinical manifestations such as acute myocardial infarction, but research has demonstrated that the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is intricately linked to many other cardiovascular abnormalities, from hyperhomocysteinemia to diabetes mellitus. Inflammation and oxidative stress, for instance, are common mediators for these diseases. Their interrelatedness has elicited much interest in finding a molecular marker with both prognostic and diagnostic values. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is one such molecule, recently gaining wider acceptance as a novel cardiovascular risk factor. As an endogenous competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), ADMA is elevated in the plasma of patients with hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. Not only is plasma ADMA concentration predictive of cardiovascular events, ADMA reduces the production of the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic molecule, nitric oxide. As such, ADMA is both a disease marker and a mediator, whose pathophysiology merits attention. This article reviews the current knowledge of ADMA within the larger context of the NOS pathway.",

Materials & Methods: We collected totally 6,406 adult subjects (41.4% women) from January to December 2001 from the health screening program in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan. High CRP was classified as more than 5.31 mg/L, which was the 90th percentile cutoff value. Components of metabolic syndrome were defined by the modified Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Results: There were 13.5% of the study population with age older than 65 years, with 7.2% abstinence and 17.3% current smokers. The average CRP levels, after adjusting for gender and smoking effects, were 3.43 mg/L in young and 4.64 mg/L in elderly population (p < 0.0001). The prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome was 19.4%, higher in elderly than young age (29.1% vs. 17.9%, p < 0.0001). CRP levels were positively related with smoking status. After adjusting for multiple variables such as gender and smoking status, high CRP levels still strongly associated with metabolic syndrome. Conclusions: CRP was significantly associated with smoking and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation, smoking and atherosclerotic risks were interrelated among healthy population in Taiwan.",

However, little data are available regarding the usage of statin in AMI patients in real-world practice. The present study investigated the current status of statin use and the effect of continuous statin treatment on clinical outcomes in patients with AMI. Methods and Results: Three hundred and twenty-five patients (aged 62±13 years, M/F=258/67) with AMI were enrolled. The administration of statin therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients were classified into 2 groups: patients receiving continuous statin therapy, defined as at least 85% of statin intake throughout the whole study period (adherent group, n = 167, 51%) and patients not taking continuous statin therapy (nonadherent group, n=158, 49%). Continuous statin therapy was independently associated with a reduction in the risk of adverse clinical outcomes (38% versus 68%; P＜0.0001). By Cox proportional hazard analyses, the adjusted odds ratio for the development of adverse events in the adherent group compared with the nonadherent group was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.97, P=0.039). Conclusion: Continuous statin therapy may reduce the risk of adverse clinical outcomes after AMI. However, the relatively low use of statin in the study patients indicates that there remains substantial room to improve implementation of statin therapy to AMI patients in real-world practice.",

In this study, we compare balloon dilatation with surgery in terms of the efficacy of treating native aortic coarctation in patients less than 120 days of age. Methods: Between January 2000 and October 2006, after excluding patients with complex cardiac anomalies, we enrolled 21 patients with native aortic coarctation in this study. Group 1 included 9 patients who accepted balloon dilatation for discrete isthmic stenosis. Group 2 included 12 patients who underwent surgical aortoplasty by end-to-end anastomosis for long segment stenosis. We compared the demographic data, hospital days, complications, residual gradients and restenosis rates between the two groups. Results: There were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of the demographic data, age at procedure, immediate pressure relief, restenosis rate or survival rate. Procedure-related complications occurred more frequently after surgical repair compared with angioplasty (p=0.02). Themedian post-procedure hospital stay was shorter in the angioplasty than in the surgery group: 6 days (range, 3 to 82 days) in the angioplasty group and 27 days (range, 7 to 292 days) in the surgery group (p = 0.005). At a median follow-up of 19 months, two group 1 patients had recoarctation requiring surgery, and three group 2 patients also experienced reintervention due to restenosis or severe residual coarctation. Conclusion: These data suggest that balloon angioplasty may be an acceptable alternative to surgical treatment for native discrete aortic coarctation in neonates and young infants.",

They bear relationship to cardiac-arterial interactions of the various arterial wall properties. Values of pulse wave velocity (PWV), especially the brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) are a practical predictor of the severity of atherosclerosis in adults. However, changes of value of baPWV in health children (8-19 years old) have rarely been assessed. We therefore investigated the changes in values of baPWV in healthy Taiwanese children. Method: Between Oct. 2004 and Dec. 2005, in the Pediatric Cardiovascular Outpatient Department of Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, was measured values of baPWV and other vital measurements in 123 healthy (systolic blood pressure (SBP)≤120 mmHg, body mass index (BMI)≤24 and no underlying heart disease) children (51 boys and 72 girls). The relationship between baPWV and vital measurements was analyzed by linear regression and step-wise multiple linear regression using SPSS 10.0 software. Result: The value of baPWV could be predicted by ankle diastolic pressure (aDBP) and body height (Ht) (baPWV=279.78+5.02(superscript *)aDBP+2.67(superscript *)Ht. p＜0.05). It also increased with age, body weight (Wt), brachial systolic blood pressure (bSBP), and brachial diastolic blood pressure (bDBP), independently. It was not statistically correlated with BMI, heart rate (HR) or ankle systolic blood pressure (aSBP). Conclusion: Based on our results, it is worthwhile to use values of baPWV as indicators of changes in arterial wall properties in healthy Taiwanese children.",

Post-stenting inflammation may be among the major pathogenetic mechanisms in which vascular reactions produce intimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cell migration. The objective of this open-label randomized controlled study was to evaluate the effect of phosphorylcholine-coated stents treated with dexamethasone to prevent TSR. Method: We evaluated 17 discrete coronary lesions with a stenosis diameter＞ 70% from 13 patients. The diameter of the reference vessels ranged from 2.7mm to 3.7 mm (mean 3.18 ± 0.31 mm). Using open-label randomization, 9 lesions were assigned to the control group and implanted with un-coated bare-metal stents. The remaining lesions were treated with dexamethasone-treated phosphorylcholine-coated stents. All patients were followed clinically and/or angiographically. Result: One patient died from a nontreatment-related event one week after the procedure. Four patients, two each in the dexamethasone group and the control group, refused to have a follow-up coronary angiography (CAG), however, three of those patients refusing CAG had a thallium myocardial perfusion study. Of these patients, 2 in control group showed myocardial perfusion impairment. In the remaining 12 lesions in 7 patients, the diameter of the stenosis was smaller in the dexamethasone group versus the control group, although the difference was not significant statistically (0.33 ± 0.22 versus 0.22 ± 0.06 mm, p = 0.352). There was a tendency toward a higher binary restenosis rate in the control group versus the dexamethasone group (33% vs. 0%, p = 0.202). When the angiographic and clinical restenosis rates were combined, the control group had a significantly higher restenosis rate than the dexamethasone group (44.4% vs. 0% p = 0.042). One patient from the control group underwent target lesion revascularization.

    "abstract": "Background: The status of percutancous coronary intervention (PCI) for the treatment of left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease remains undetermined, and relatively few data On Taiwanese population has been published. Method: Between March. 2003 and October, 2008. 121 patients with de-novo significant LMCA disease were included into this study. Eighty-seven patients received coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) for LMCA disease, and 34 patients received PCI for LMCA disease. Significant LMCA disease was defined as at least＞50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery. The differences of clinical outcomes between the two treatment strategies were compared with respect to the in-hospital major adverse events rate and long-term major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) rate. Results: There were no significant differences in terms of baseline characteristics between the two groups. The overall all-cause mortality with MACCE was 32.2% in the CABG group, and 35.3% in the PCI group (p=0.74). The overall mortality throughout the study period was 17.2% in the CABG group, and 5.9% in the PCI group (p=0.09). The CABG group had significantly higher in-hospital major adverse event rates (27.6%) than the PCI group (8.8%) (p=0.02) after adjustment of potential covariates. Long-term cumulative MACCE rates were 15% in the CABG group, and 32.4% in the PCI group. respectively (p=0.02). The lower MACCE rate in the CABG group was mainly due to lower revascularization rate in the CABG group than in the PCI group (8.8% vs. 29.4%; p ＜0.01). Conclusion: The CABG group conferred significantly higher in-hospital major adverse event rate hut significantly lower long-term MACCE rate in patients with significant LMCA disease. The CABG group displayed numerically higher incidence of all-cause mortality throughout the study period. PCI could he considered an alternative option for patients with unprotected LMCA disease.",

However, the mechanism of this correlation is still unknown. There is still no report on the relationship between the variability of anti-platelet effect of aspirin and the changes of sVCAM-1, hs-CRP and platelet monocyte aggregates. Methods: A total of 42 cases, 22 men and 20 women, aged between 41 and 81 years at high cardiovascular risk (because of the presence of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or at least two c1assical cardiovascular risk factors) were enrolled randomly from outpatient c1inics. The patients were in stable condition and under therapy of 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin preparation per day for at least 1 month. Serum levels of markers of inflammation (hs-CRP), endothelial activation (sVCAM-1), platelet activation and platelet monocyte aggregates were measured. In addition, an in vitro cell culture model was used to study the effect of aspirin on platelet-induced VCAM-I mRNA expression and nuc1ear factor (NF)-κB activation in endothelial cells (ECs). Results: High-risk patients taking aspirin were divided into a high 50-percentile group and a low 50-percentile group according to their different degrees of platelet activation. No significant difference was found in hs-CRP and platelet monocyte aggregates between these two groups. However, the high-platelet activation group had significantly higher sVCAM-1 than did the low platelet-activation group. Aspirin not only inhibited platelet activation by adenodiphosphate (ADP), but also decreased the activated platelet-induced VCAM-l expression and NF-κB activation in ECs. Conclusion: Inadequate inhibition of platelet activation by aspirin was associated with higher serum concentration of sVCAM-1 in subjects with high cardiovascular risk.",

    "abstract": "Background: Lesions in the ostial left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery are usually considered an indication for bypass surgery because of possible distal left main (LM) involvement. Percutaneuos coronary intervention for such lesions is considered a high-risk procedure because of high rates of acute complications and later restenosis. The implantation of drug-eluting stents has bee reported to reduce angiographic restenosis and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) compared to bare-metal stent. To date, there is little literature regarding the safety and efficacy of drug-eluting stent implantation in ostial. We sought to investigate the immediate and late clinical outcomes of paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) implantation for such lesions. Methods: From July 2004 to October 2007, PES were implanted in 44 consecutive patients with ostial LAD stenoses in our hospital. We applied two different stenting strategies: (1) precise stent positioning, and (2) stent covering the distal LM coronary in the presence of intermediate distal LM lesions, thus ensuring full lesion coverage. We retrospectively reviewed the charts to assess MACE, which included cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), target lesion revascularization (TLR) or target vessel revascularization. Results: Forty-four patients (30 males, 14 females) with a mean age of 64.4±10.2 years (range 46-83 years) were evaluated. The angiographic as well as procedural success rate was 100%, and none of the patients had in-hospital MACE. Clinical one-year follow-up was available for all patients. Angiographic follow-up was available for seventeen (38.6%) patients. Neither cardiac death nor stent thrombosis occurred in our patients, but one (2.3%) patient had non-fatal MI during the follow-up period. Four patients had clinically-driven angiographic restenosis and underwent TLR subsequently. The cumulative MACE-free survival rate was 88.6% at one year. Conclusions: Paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation in ostial LAD lesions with complete lesion coverage achieves high procedural success rate and acceptable clinical outcomes during the one-year follow-up period.",

Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into group 1 (saline-treated DCM), group 2 (BMDMNC implantation), group 3 (pre-implant SW applied to BMDMNCs), and group 4 (normal control). Rats were euthanized on day 90 following DCM induction. Results: The number of small vessels in implanted area was highest in group 3 (all p＜0.005). Connexin43 (Cx43) protein expression was significantly enhanced in group 3 compared to groups 1 and 2 (all p＜0.0003). While mRNA expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and interleukin-10 were higher in groups 2-4 than in group 1 (all P＜0.05), caspase-3, endothelin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 mRNA expressions were lower in groups 2-4 compared with group 1 (all P＜0.05). LV ejection was higher, while mitochondrial oxidative stress and fibrosis of LV myocardium were lower, in groups 2-4 compared to group 1 (all P＜0.003). Conclusion: Pre-implantation SW treatment of BMDMNCs significantly enhanced myocardial vascularization and Cx43 expression which, however, offered no added improvement in LV function compared with BMDMNC treatment alone in rat dilated cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "Background: Transradial approach is accepted as an alternative method for coronary angiography and angioplasty. The body size and radial artery size in Taiwanese patients are thought to be smaller than those of Western populations. This study assessed the transradial approach in Taiwanese patients.\nMethods: This prospective study enrolled 336 patients who underwent coronary angiography or angioplasty in our hospital during the period from February 2001 to February 2002. Ultrasound examinations were performed 3 times (pre-procedure, early post-procedure, and late post-procedure). The ultrasound examinations included 2-dimensional and Doppler studies. The patients were divided into radial artery occlusion and patent subgroups depending on the ultrasound results after transradial coronary procedure.\nResults: A transradial approach was used to perform coronary angiography in 176 patients as well as coronary angiography plus angioplasty in 160 patients. The mean radial artery inner diameter (RAID) measured by ultrasound was 2.78±0.40 mm pre-procedure. The RAID in males was larger than in females (2.88±0.39 vs. 2.53±0.32 mm, p＜0.001). There was no significant correlation between RAID and age, height, weight, body mass index, and body surface area. The flow volume in men was larger than in women (0.03±0.01 vs. 0.02±0.01L/min, p＜0.001). Radial artery occlusion developed after transradial approach in 36 patients (10.7%), among which recanalization was observed within 3 months in 26 patients. in patients with occlusion of the radial artery after transradial approach the RAID, RAID/sheath outer diameter ratio, and flow volume were smaller than in the patent patients (p ＜0.001). There was no significant difference in RAID, flow velocity and flow volume between pre-procedural, early post-procedural, and late post-procedural ultrasound examinations in patients who did not develop occlusion.\nConclusion: This study found that transradial coronary procedure is a safe and practical alternative approach for Taiwanese patients with a normal Allen test. Ultrasound examination of the radial artery was useful in selecting an access route for coronary procedure, an appropriate size of the sheath, and in the follow-up of vascular complications.",

This report shares our early experience of robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: The robotic-assisted endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting of the left internal thoracic artery to the left anterior descending artery was performed by using the da Vinci robotic system. Two robotic instruments and one endoscopic camera were placed through three small ports. A robotic system was used to harvest the left internal thoracic artery; anastomoses were performed directly through a left anterior minimal thoracotomy under off-pump coronary artery bypass. Results: Between January 2005 and September 2005, the new instrumentation was used in 10 patients. The mean age of the patients was 59 years, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%. Two of the 10 patients received double coronary artery bypass grafts. They had a radial artery graft bridging the left internal thoracic artery to the diagonal branch through a small left anterior thoracotomy. No major complications were encountered in the postoperative period, except for one patient who was admitted because of left-side pleural effusion. The median length of stay in the intensive care unit was 2.2 days. The mdian postoperative hospital stay was 7.1 days. Conclusion: The results from this prospective clinical trial in our hospital showed favorable short-term outcome with no adverse events.

Methods: Fifty patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) were enrolled. They were divided into two groups: a nonsystolic heart failure (NS-CHF) group with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF≥50%, n = 24) and a systolic heart failure (S-CHF) group with reduced LVEF (＜ 50%, n = 26). Plasma NT-proBNP levels and LVEF by bedside echocardiography were measured within 24 hours of admission. Combined adverse cardiac events (death or heart failure) and all-cause mortality were monitored. Results: The levels of plasma NT-proBNP in NS-CHF and S-CHF groups were 6055.7 ± 5039.5 pg/mL and 20343.8 ± 11968.4 pg/mL, respectively (p＜0.001). Patients with lower body mass index (BMI), anemia, and impaired renal function were more frequently found in the high plasma NT-proBNP group (NT-proBNP levels ≥9215 pg/mL). During the follow-up period, the group of patients with higher plasma NT-proBNP levels (≥ 9215 pg/mL) had more adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio 4.967, p = 0.011) and a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio 58.94, p = 0.004). The plasma NT-proBNP level was the only significant independent predictor of combined adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality.

Conclusions: In critical care patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, plasma NT-proBNP level within 24 hours after admission is an independent predictor of combined adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality. The use of ACEI/ARB and beta-blocker also predicts a lower rate of all-cause mortality in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Morbidity and mortality due to heart failure remains high in spite of advances in its medical management. Daring the last decade a new modality has emerged that has now proven to be beneficial in a select group of patients with heart failure. This is the cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), which is based on correcting various types of cardiac dyssynchrony that many patients with heart failure have. Though a large number of trials have demonstrated clinical and hemodynamic benefits of CRT, it is only recent that mortality benefits have been shown. The mortality benefit is further improved when CRT is combated with intracardiac defibrillator in selected patients of heart failure. Based on the existing criteria for selection of heart failure patients for CRT (NYHA Ⅲ or Ⅳ, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction＜35% and presence of left bundle branch block with QRS duration＞120 ms). 30-40% patients do not respond favorably. Newer modalities like speckle tracking imaging and three-dimensional echocardiography are being validated to differentiate responder from nonresponder. This is extremely important in view of the high cost of the device. This review article highlights logic behind CRT, criteria for selection of cases, problems of non response, role of combined CRT -defibrillator and other related issues.",

    "abstract": "Background: Coronary artery perforation is a rare but life-threatening complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. We report our experience of incidence, management, and clinical outcomes of procedure-related coronary artery perforation in 13,888 consecutive patients. Methods and Results: 13,888 patients underwent PCI for coronary artery disease from October 1992 to December 2006. During this period, 21 (0.15%) patients developed coronary artery perforation during PCI. Four patients with Ellis type I coronary artery perforation were treated successfully, including conservative treatment in 2 and device therapy in 2. Out of eight patients with Ellis type II coronary artery perforation, 2 patients received conservative treatment, 5 received device therapy and 1 received surgical ligation. One patient receiving device therapy had late cardiac tamponade and she expired due to aspiration pneumonia resulting from emergent endotracheal intubation. Among the seven patients with Ellis type III coronary artery perforation, 5 received device therapy and 2 received emergent surgical repairs. Additionally, four of them needed emergent pericardiocentesis for immediate cardiac tamponade. One of the 2 patients with Ellis type IV coronary artery perforation was treated with balloon inflation, but he expired due to concomitant pneumonia. The other patient received surgical repair. Conclusion: Management of coronary artery perforation can be tailored according to the classification of coronary artery perforation and the hemodynamic status. Most patients can be treated successfully with non-surgical therapies. However, surgicalinterventionshouldbeprovidedpromptly if non-surgicaltherapiesfail.

    "abstract": "Background Post-dilation with kissing balloon dilation remains controversial in the 1-stent approach, but many technical improvements are possible to refine the final results. This study aimed to evaluate the results of different side-branch (SB) ostial treatments after main vessel stenting, including ostial optimization technique (OOT), simultaneous kissing balloon dilation (KBD) and single balloon dilation (SBD). Methods Three different ostial side branch treatments (OOT, n = 6; KBD, n = 6; SBD, n = 6) were emulated in a synthetic bifurcated phantom using a second-generation sirolimus-eluting stent (Firebird2TM, Microport, Shanghai, China). Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed to assess morphologies. Results Compared to the non-OOT procedures (SBD and KBD), OOT was characterized by the sequential dilation of two snuggling balloons, creating a longer valgus struts length (OOT: 2.13 ± 0.30 mm, SBD: 1.23 ± 0.34 mm, KBD: 1.11 ± 0.39 mm, p < 0.01), broader angulation between the main-branch and valgus struts axes (OOT: 42.72 ± 0.91°, SBD: 25.77 ± 7.81°, KBD: 31.78 ± 1.34°, p < 0.01), shorter neocarina length (OOT: 0.28 ± 0.31 mm, SBD: 0.64 ± 0.38 mm, KBD: 1.11 ± 0.37 mm, p < 0.01), larger SB ostial area (OOT: 6.76 ± 0.17 mm2, SBD: 4.78 ± 0.86 mm2, KBD: 5.87 ± 0.89 mm2, p < 0.01), and lower index of stent cell distortion (OOT: 6.67 ± 3.33%, SBD: 10.67 ± 4.23%, KBD: 20.00 ± 5.29%, p < 0.01). In addition, the rate of severe strut malapposition was lower with the OOT procedure compared with the non-OOT procedures (OOT: 2.22 ± 0.48%, SBD: 10.31 ± 0.66%, KBD: 6.74 ± 1.24%, p < 0.01). Conclusions OOT, consisting of an initial proximal optimizing technique (POT) and sequential snuggling balloon dilation and then re-POT, significantly optimized the results of provisional bifurcation treatment. The physiological and clinical significance of our observations await further clarification.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the predictors and outcome of new-onset AF occurring after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Methods: A total of 307 patients with acute STEMI from May 2007 to June 2009 were included in our study. Of those patients, 57 patients experienced new-onset AF during their hospitalization in the coronary care unit with continuous ECG monitoring. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of AF during the hospitalization. The secondary endpoint was the all-cause mortality during a 12-month follow-up period.Results: Two hundred eighty three patients (92.2%) received revascularization during the hospitalization. The patients with new-onset AF after the acute STEMI were older, with lower diastolic blood pressure, higher initial fasting glucose, lower lipid level, and a higher incidence of coronary artery disease history when compared to those without new-onset AF. In a multivariable analysis, the initial fasting glucose level (p = 0.025, OR = 1.007, 95% CI = 1.001~1.012) was an independent predictor of the occurrence of new-onset AF after acute STEMI. New-onset AF was associated with a higher all-cause mortality rate during the follow-up (p = 0.001).Conclusion: A higher initial fasting glucose level was an independent predictor of the occurrence of AF in patients with acute STEMI, which may be associated with a poor prognosis.",

Clinical features associated with development of congestive heart failure (CHF), aortic valve prolapse (AVP), and aortic regurgitation (AR) were analyzed.Results: CHF was noted in 34 (22.4%) of 152 patients. Patients with CHF had a larger VSD size (p＜0.0001), a higher Qp/Qs ratio (p＜0.0001), and a higher mean pulmonary pressure (p＜0.0001) compared with patients without CHF. AVP was noted in 106 (69.7%) of 152 patients. Patients with AVP had an older operation age (p＜0.0001), a smaller Qp/Qs ratio (p＜0.0001), a higher systolic pressure gradient between the left and right ventricles (p＜0.0001), and a higher diastolic pressure gradient between the aorta and the right ventricle (p=0.022) compared with the patients without AVP. Among 43 (28.3%) patients with AVP and AR, 17 had mild and 4 had moderate-severe AR after surgery. Severe AVP (p=0.0231) and pre-operative AR (p＜0.001) are two risk factors for the presence of postoperative residual AR.Conclusion: Long-term outcome of surgical repairs for outlet-type VSD is excellent in most pediatric patients without severe CHF or moderate-severe AR. AVP and AR are more frequent and severe in patients with delayed surgery, highlighting the importance of early surgical treatment of outlet-type VSD.",

A pump with Ang Ⅱ was embedded in the rat backs in the Ang Ⅱ and Ang Ⅱ+TXL groups, whereas a pump containing physiological saline was emplaced in the sham group. TXL was delivered through a gastric tube in the Ang Ⅱ+TXL group. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nitric oxide (NO) in the plasma were examined 14 days later; the aortic endothelial cells were observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM); the expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), nuclear factor-кB (NF-кB), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. (VCAM-l) were measured via immunohistochemistry assays; apoptotic cells were investigated with DeadEnd(superscript TM) colorimetric TUNEL System; and the NAD(P)H oxidase subunit P22phox mRNA was examined through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Results: The plasma concentrations of ET-l and TNF-α increased significantly in the Ang Ⅱ group in comparison with the sham one, but decreased in the Ang Ⅱ+TXL group. The same observations occurred regarding NF-кB, VCAM-l, apoptosis and P22phox mRNA expressions in the aortic tissues. However, eNOS expression in the aorta produced a reverse response, which was ameliorated significantly by TXL.Conclusion: The findings suggested that TXL could play a potential role in inhibiting the oxidative injury induced by Ang Ⅱ by reducing the inflammation and the apoptotic process via the P22phox pathway.",

This study demonstrates the acute and 3-month outcomes of the first case series of TAVl in Taiwan.Methods: This study enrolled severe symptomatic AS patients who were evaluated by surgeons as having high surgical risk. The procedural and 3-month outcomes were evaluated. The Edwards SAPIEN valves were delivered via the transfemoral (TF) or transapical (TA) approaches.Results: Between May and October 2010, 10 patients received TAVI (4 via TF and 6 via TA approach). The procedures were successful in all cases. No major complications occurred within the first 24 hours after the procedure. At 3-month follow-up, no cardiovascular death occurred. One patient died of pneumonia after the TA procedure. Another TA patient developed myocardial tear 3 days after the procedure. After TAVI, none of the patients had more than grade 2 AR at discharge and 3-month follow-up. The aortic-valve area increased from 0.61±0.19 cm^2 to 1.42±0.20 cm^2 (p＜0.001), and the mean aortic valve gradient decreased from 48±16 mm Hg to 11±2 mm Hg (p＜0.001).Conclusion: The immediate and short-term outcomes were encouraging in our first 10 TAVI cases. Nevertheless, multi-specialty collaboration, pre-procedural evaluation with multimodality imaging, and proper patient selection are the cornerstones of success in treating these high-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Slow coronary flow (SCF) is an angiographic finding characterized by delayed opacification of epicardial coronary arteries in the absence of obstructive coronary disease. Leukocytes and low-grade inflammation play a major role in atherosclerotic vascular processes and may be important in other coronary pathologies. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether there is a positive correlation between leukocyte counts, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and SCF determined by frame rates.Methods: Seventy-seven individuals who underwent coronary angiography with suspected CAD, and had angiographically normal coronary arteries (NCA) of varying coronary flow rates were enrolled. From the original 77 study participants, forty-seven patients with NCA and SCF in all three coronary vessels and 30 sex- and age-matched control participants with NCA but without SCF were investigated. The quantification of the coronary flow was assessed by use of the TIMI frame count method (TFC) in all coronary arteries. The normal flow was defined as TFC ＜ 28 frames and slow flow as TFC≥28 frames.Results: HsCRP was significantly positively correlated with mean TFC (r = 0.522, p ＜ 0.001). In addition, leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes were significantly positively related to mean TFC (r = 0.353, p = 0.002; r = 0.298, p = 0.009 and r = 0.511, p ＜ 0.001, respectively). In multivariate analyses, only hsCRP (βeta: 0.324, p = 0.003) and monocyte count (βeta: 0.354, p = 0.003) were related to SCF as determined by TFC.Conclusion: Our results showed that circulating monocytes and low-grade inflammation are related to SCF. Although we cannot make conclusive assumptions about the underlying pathologic process of SCF, we believe that these findings may be pivotal for further studies which seek to ascertain the specific roles of monocytes and hsCRP on SCF phenomenon in coronary vasculature.",

This study was conducted to identify this group from other NSTEMI. Methods: Two hundred patients underwent coronary angiography for NSTEMI. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) measurements were performed simultaneously. Results: Most subjects had multi-vessel disease except for 13 patients with single-vessel LCX disease. The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and renal insufficiency in the group of single-vessel LCX disease was relatively low. Since left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved in the majority of subjects. the rates of respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock and high left ventricular filling pressure were lower in the group of single-vessel disease than that in the other NSTEMI patients. Therefore, the in-hospital mortality rate differed between these two groups (0% vs. 6%, respectively). By receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, lateral myocardial performance index (MPI) divided by mean MPI was a good indicator of single-vessel LCX disease (lateral MPI/mean MPI＞1.17, with sensitivity 92%, specificity 84%, and p＜0.0001).

Indomethacin has been the initial treatment of choice for PDA in premature neonates despite reports of varying success and the risk of renal insufficiency, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Early surgical therapy has been advocated with variable results. Methods: From January of 1999 to January of 2002, the charts of 57 extremely low birth weight (weighing less than 1000g) neonates who had a PDA were retrospectively reviewed in this series. Of them, 16 were only treated with aggressive medical therapy and 27 received one to two courses of intravenous indomethacin. Surgical ligation was performed in 22 patients in whom indomethacin therapy was contraindicated or failed.\nResults: The overall response rate to indomethacin alone was 70.4 per cent. No mortality was associated with the surgical procedure itself. The incidence of indomethacin-associated morbidity was comparable with that previously reported. The surgical group had higher rate of renal dysfunction than the indomethacin group because many patients in whom indomethacin was contraindicated due to renal problems received surgery. There was no difference in the post-treatment duration intubation, hospital stay, and rate of discharge on oxygen between the two groups.\nConclusion: Surgical ligation of PDA might be considered early in the treatment of extremely low birth weight neonates who have either a lower probability of PDA closure with indomethacin or an increased risk of developing complications from this treatment.",

Patients and Methods: Between June 2000 and November 2001, 20 patients diagnosed as secundum atrial septal defects underwent transcatheter closure of their defects using the Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) device. Indications for 18 patients were larger atrial septal defects with Qp:Qs＞1.5 and transthoracic echocardiography study revealing right heart dilatation and paradoxical interventricular septal motion. All patients were followed up for a period of 6 months to 2 years. Results: Nineteen ASO devices were successfully implanted in 20 patients. One patient was referred for surgery due to implantation failure. The success rate was 95%. The median age of the patients was 10.1 years. Male to female ratiowas 1:1.5. The mean Qp: Qs ratio was 2.5:1 The ASD sizewasmeasuredas 7-26.5mm(mean±SD; 16.5±5.9mm) on transoesophageal echocardiogram, and its diameter 8-29.5mm (19.4±6.5mm) using the balloon-stretched method.

However, clinical data about the prognostic value of CRP levels in patients with chronic stable CHF are spare. We hypothesized that measurement of CRP might provide prognostic information in these patients. Methods: We measured serum levels of CRP in 72 patients with chronic CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ＜50%. Major adverse cardiac events (death or hospitalization with worsening CHF) during a median follow-up period of 449 days were determined. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of major adverse cardiac events. Results: The concentrations of CRP in the sample population were significantly increased with the severity of CHF. The 25 patients who had adverse events had significantly higher CRP levels (p = 0.0065) than the 47 patients who were event-free. We further divided the 72 CHF patients into tertiles on the basis of this sample, with the cutoff points for each tertile being ≤2.69, ＞ 2.69 to ≤ 5.38, and ＞5.38 mg per liter, respectively. The differences between event-free curves were insignificant between tertiles 1 and 2 but were significant between tertiles 1 and 3 and between tertiles 2 and 3 (p = 0.0048, p = 0.0103, respectively). In a multivariate analysis (n =58), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and serum levels of CRP ＞ 5.38 mg per liter were found to be independently significant predictors for major adverse cardiac events in patients with chronic CHF. The CRP levels were significantly correlated with LVEDP (r = 0.26, p = 0.048; n=58). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the levels of CRP are related to clinical outcomes and that measurement of CRP has the potential to play an important role as an adjunct for risk assessment in patients with chronic CHF.",

They had coved-type Brugada ECG, and one of them had positive procainamide provocative test. Both received implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator. One had recurrent events and received ICD discharge within 4 weeks after implantation. Our study showed that Brugada syndrome could occur in the elderly, and its clinical presentations were as severe as those in younger patients.",

Angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis and a guide to therapy, although other noninvasive modalities are increasingly useful. Both surgery and coil embolism are options for correcting this anomaly. The final choice, however, depends on the precise anatomic distribution of the fistula. Here we report a patient who had a giant aneurysm-like right coronary artery resulting from a fistula terminating in the coronary sinus and another fistula arising from the circumflex artery. Surgical ligation was chosen over coil embolism to prevent unintended distal embolism. The patient underwent a successful operation and no longer experienced her previous symptoms.",

The diagnosis is made by detecting the defect between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery while both semilunar valves are fully developed. Based on the anatomical characteristics, APW is classified into four types: proximal (Type 1) defect, distal (Type 2) defect, total (Type 3) defect and intermediate (Type 4) defect. APW is traditionally treated by surgery, and there are a few reports about transcatheter APW closure in infancy. Only defects with adequate superior and inferior rims can be considered for device closure. We describe two cases who underwent transcatheter APW closure with the Amplatzer duct occluder-I (ADO-I).

However, safety and efficacy of using multiple overlapping drug-eluting stents in patients with diffuse coronary artery lesions remain unclear. We reported the clinical and angiographic outcomes of overlapping paclitaxel-eluting stents at 9 months post-implantation in our mstltution. Methods: From April 2004 to November 2007, we evaluated fifty-one consecutive patients who required overlapping pac1itaxel-eluting stents for diffuse, de novo coronary lesions (＞ 20 mm). A retrospective chart review was conducted at the end of9 months to identify any major adverse cardiac events during the 9-month period after the procedure. Result: The study population consisted of fifty-one patients and included 60.8% of the cases with diabetes mellitus (60.8%) and 32 cases with triple-vessel disease (62.7%). The number of stents implanted per patient was 2.1±0.3, and the mean total stent length was 56.5±12.1 mm. Procedural success was achieved in 100% of the cases. No patients had in-hospital Q-wave myocardial infarction, intraprocedural stent thrombosis or death. Forty-five patients (88%) were available for clinical follow-up, and 28 patients (54.9%) had an angiographic follow-up during the 9-month period. One patient died of non-cardiac cause, three patients underwent target lesion revascularization (6.7%) and four patients (8.9%) underwent target vessel revascularization after 9-month clinical follow up. The rate of major adverse cardiac events at 9 months was 8.9%. Conclusion: Overlapping paclitaxel-eluting stents are relatively safe and associated with good midterm c1inical outcomes in patients with diffuse coronary lesions.",

Here, we isolated human sternal MSCs (hMSCs) from patients undergoing cardiac surgery and investigated their growth properties, immortalization and the cardiomyogenic differentiation. Methods: Bone marrow from sternum during cardiac surgery was collected (n=20). hMSCs were isolated through immuno-depletion, density gradient centrifugation and selective adhesion. Their growth properties were determined. Sternal hMSCs were characterized by surface antigens, immortalized by HPV16 E6/E7 retroviral vector and then exposed to 5-azacytidine. Results: Sternal hMSCs showed a gradual loss of ability to proliferate during cell passage, accompanied by a morphological conversion of senescence tendency. They uniformly lacked antigens typically identifying haematopoietic cells. They were positive for CD90, CD44, CD29 and other MSCs markers (SH2, SH3 and SH4). The HPV16 E6/E7 retroviral vector successfully immortalized the sternal hMSCs. After induction of 5-azacytidine, primary culture, early passage and immortalized E6/E7 hMSCs, but not late passaged cells, demonstrated the aborted cardiomyogenic differentiation by activating a cardiac-specific gene, cardiac troponin-1 without a recognizable morphologically differentiated phenotype. Conclusion: Expanded sternal hMSCs from patients undergoing cardiac surgery showed senescent tendency with decreased ability of proliferation and differentiation in cardiomyogenic lineage. Specifically immortalized hMSCs may regain the ability of cardiomyogenic differentiation and serve as a useful cell source for elucidation of cardiomyogcnic differentiation.",

However, the definite benefit and treatment protocols are still under debate. We conducted a tirofiban-based follow-up study to assess the effects of early-invasive strategy in NSTEACS. Methods: This was a prospective, open-label randomized trial. The study had a two-by-two factorial design, combining enoxaparin/unfractionated heparin and early-invasive/early-conservative strategies. The early-invasive arm mandated coronary angiography within 12 hours after randomization, while the counterpart took more than 48 hours. All enrolled patients received tirofiban at admission. The primary endpoint was composed of cardiovascular death, re-hospitalization due to recurrent angina, target vessel revascularization and unscheduled coronary bypass surgery in follow-up. The secondary endpoint concerned the bleeding complications. Results: After a 2-year follow-up of 61 eligible patients, the early-invasive arm did not show benefit over the early-conservative arm (RR=0.522, P=0.318; Kaplan Meier (KM) log-rank P=0.36) and enoxaparin was not superior to unfractionated heparin (RR=0.319, P=0.079; KM log-rank P=0.15). From another viewpoint, updated strategies utilizing either enoxaparin or early catheterization were better than the conventional one, which adopted unfractionated heparin and delayed angiography (RR=0.276, 95% CI 0.101-0.752, P=0.026; KM log-rank P=0.0026). There was no difference in bleeding complications. Conclusion: The updated treatment should be superior to the most conventional protocol in treating NSTEACS But, we cannot conclude that the early-invasive strategy benefits all NSTEACS patients more, especially when optimal adjunctive pharmacologic therapies are applied.",

Patients with previous myocardial infarction or bundle branch block were excluded. Forty cases were enrolled in the study and were divided into two groups according to the IRA, either right coronary artery (RCA) or left circumflex artery (LCX). IRA was determined by the angiographic criteria: the artery supplying the area of asynergy with (1) total or subtotal occlusion, or (2) arteriographic features suggestive of thrombus in arteries with more than 50% luminal stenosis. Ten EKG criteria were used for comparison. There were two useful EKG criteria for predicting the IRA. Isoelectric or elevated ST-segment in lead Ⅰ could predict LCX as the IRA with 87.5% specificity and 63% sensitivity. Greater ST depression in lead aVL than in lead Ⅰ and greater ST elevation in lead Ⅲ than in lead Ⅱ could predict RCA as the IRA with 50% specificity and 97% sensitivity.\nConclusion: Isoelectric or elevated ST-segment in lead Ⅰ suggesting LCX as the IRA and greater ST depression in lead aVL than in lead Ⅰ and greater ST elevation in lead Ⅲ than in lead Ⅱ suggesting RCA as the IRA are two useful EKG criteria for identification of IRA of inferior wall AMI.",

    "abstract": "Background: Prior studies have demonstrated that during atrial fibrillation (AF), beats with equal preceding and pre-preceding R-R intervals, defined as intervals differing less than 5%, could be used to determine the mean values instead of measuring over 20 cardiac cycles. It is not known whether beats with interval difference less than 10% could be used in the same way. Methods: In 120 patients with AF, Doppler aortic flow time-velocity integral was determined for at least 20 consecutive cardiac cycles. The values at beats with interval difference of less than 5% and less than 10% were chosen. These were then compared with the measured average values over all cardiac cycles. Results: Agreement and mean percentage difference analyses revealed that the accuracy of measurements using inter-beat variability less than 10% was similar to that using less than 5% for 2- and 3-beat analyses provided the R-R intervals were longer than 500 milliseconds. The values at beats with cycle lengths shorter than 500 milliseconds were usually far below the average values. The mean percentage differences were not significantly different between methods using interval differences of less than 5% and less than 10% for 3-beat analysis (2.83% vs. 2.97%, p = 0.269). Moreover, it is relatively easy to obtain beats with interval difference less than 10%. The median numbers of beats required finding 3 beats with inter-beat variability of less than 10% and less than 5% were 9 and 16, respectively. Conclusions: Averaging 3 beats with R-R interval difference less than 10% and cycle lengths longer than 500 milliseconds can be applied to accurately estimate Doppler-derived aortic flow for patients with AF.",

Methods: Risk variables from 17,539 Taiwanese (8516 men and 9023 women, aged 30 years and older) randomly selected from a large physical checkup database were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis with principal components method. Results: Factor analysis identified two independent factors for men and women, respectively.

There are several surgical procedures available for this rare disease, including lobectomy, ligation or anastomosis of the anomalous systemic artery. Transarterial embolization is a new and semi-invasive technique compared with surgical treatment. Here we describe one 3 month-old female infant with congestive heart failure and one 13 year-old girl with mitral regurgitation and hemoptysis. Computed tomography and angiography demonstrated anomalous systemic artery supply to the left lower lung without coexistence of pulmonary sequestration in both cases.

Materials and Methods: We found that there were short-term reversible postoperative declines in free thyroxine (T4), total T4, total tri-iodothyronine (TT3) and thyrotropin concentrations. TT3 decreased significantly from preoperative state to 30min after the start of CPB (p=0.007) and 1 day postoperatively (p=0.008). The significant changes of the thyroid hormones in our 20 patients belonged to the euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS). There was no surgical complication and no need for thyroid hormone replacement. All these patients recovered and were discharged home smoothly. Conclusions: We conclude that patients with CHDs under cardiac surgery might present with ESS in postoperative period, but have no need for thyroid hormone replacement and will recover spontaneously within one week.",

    "abstract": "Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and leads to a significant source of morbidity and mortality after the surgery. Due to its involving less manipulation of the atria, off-pump CABG was thought to have a lower incidence of postoperative AF compared with on-pump CABG. Methods: Two hundred and twenty-five patients (154 male) underwent CABG. Preoperative permanent AF patients were excluded (n=12). Group 1 consisted of 78 patients (53 male, 68.6±11.9 years old; 25 female, 70.7±7.9 years old) who received off-pump CABG, and group 2 included 135 patients (93 male, 72.1±10.1 years old; 42 female, 72.3±7.9 years old) who underwent on-pump CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during the same study period. The incidence and predictors of postoperative AF were analyzed. Results: AF developed in 60 cases (28.2%) after CABG. There were higher incidence of myocardial infarction, history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NYHA Fc≧2, β-blocker use, and longer intubation in the on-pump group compared with the off-pump group. However, there was no significant difference relating to the incidence of AF between off-pump (23.1%) and on-pump (31.1%) groups. The predictors of AF were old age (＞65 years, OR: 5.008, 95% CI: 1.4-17.9, p=0.013), history of paroxysmal AF (OR: 7.851, 95%CI: 2.4-25.6, p=0.001) and prolonged postoperative intubation days (＞3 days, OR: 5.303, 95%CI: 2.2-13.1, p＜0.001). Conclusion: In this retrospective study, off-pump CABG surgery did not decrease the incidence of postoperative AF.",

Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial Doppler, echocardiography, 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring and electrophysiological study are tools for detecting cardioembolic sources. Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke and long-term anticoagulation is proved to prevent stroke. Despite knowledge of guidelines, doctors recommend anticoagulant for less than half of patients with AF who have risk factors for cardioembolic stroke and no contraindication for its usage. Direct thrombin inhibitor offers the advantage of not needing prothrombin time controls and dose adjustments, but it needs large clinical trial for confirmation. Any type of anticoagulant by any route should not be used in acute cardioembolic stroke. Stroke after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), although rare, is associated with high mortality. Cardiologist must flush catheters thoroughly, minimize catheter manipulation and use minimal contrast medium during PCI.",

In the present study, we hypothesized the concentrations of NT-proBNP would be increased proportionately with increasing aortic regurgitation (AR) severity due to volume overload. Furthermore, we wanted to explore the value of NT-proBNP as a marker for AR patients with symptoms of congestive heart failure. Method: Eighty-two patients were divided into 3 groups as determinated by the severity of AR and symptoms of congestive heart failure; they included: Non-significant AR (n=30)-the ratio of regurgitant jet width to left ventricular outflow tract diameter (LVOTD)＜45% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I; Asymptomatic significant AR (n=26)-the ratio of regurgitant jet width to LVOTD≥45% and NYHA functional class Ⅰ; Symptomatic significant AR (n=26)-the ratio of regurgitant jet width to LVOTD≥45% and NYHA functional class Ⅱ, Ⅲ, or Ⅳ.An immunoassay method was used for the quantitative determination of NT-proBNP. Result: The level of NT-proBNP was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic significant AR (1534.1±2106.7 pg/ml) than the value in the non-significant AR group (122.6±125.6 pg/ml) and the asymptomatic significant group (299.4±247.7 pg/ml) (p＜0.001 and p=0.001, respectively). An NT-proBNP level≥210 pg/ml was associated with the highest combination of sensitivity (78%) and specificity (68%) for the prediction of significant symptomatic AR. The possibility of missing symptomatic significant AR was low with NT-proBNP level＜110 pg/ml. The possibility of diagnosing symptomatic significant AR was extremely high with NT-proBNP level≥860 pg/ml. Conclusion: NT-proBNP level was strongly related to symptoms of CHF and could be used for predicting symptoms of CHF in patients with significant chronic AR.",

    "abstract": "Background: Seasonality in the occurrence of a disease often suggests the presence of environmental factors in its etiology. Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology that occurs predominantly in infants and young children. KD is characterized by fever, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, skin rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. It is believed to be a multifactorial disease, and its seasonality had never been examined epidemiologically. Aim: We sought to examine the seasonality of KD in Taiwan by using a higher-power statistical method. Method: Epidemiologic data of Kawasaki disease in Taiwan between 1996 and 2002 were taken from a published paper. Basically, the database came from the National Health Insurance data and hospitalized patients who were under 18 years old and met criteria listed for KD (ICD-9-CM code: 446.1) were selected. The data were transformed and analyzed in the form of cumulative distribution curve. Kuiper's test was applied to test the seasonality, and differences were deemed significant at a p value ＜ 0.05. Results: The cumulative distribution curve for KD in Taiwan was developed for each year. The results of Kuiper's test for seasonality in each year between 1996 and 2002 showed statistical significance for all years examined, (p＜0.01) and ascertained the presence of seasonality for KD. Conclusion: Epidemiological analysis of KD patients in Taiwan confirmed the seasonality of this disease. This will support the theory that certain infectious agents may cause KD. Extended survey of the ubiquitous etiology is advised.",

Electrocardiography (ECG) data regarding such a continuous change in pre-hypertension and hypertension subjects and their comparison with hiomarkers are still elusive. Methods and Materials: We studied 364 subjects including 140 normal subjects (mean age 47.6±9.4, 49% female), 136 pre-hypertensives (mean age 50.6±9.6, 32% female) and 88 hypertensives (mean age 58.6±11.5, 44% female). Baseline demographic data and levels of biomarkers [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and N-terminal-pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP)] were collected, with various 12-lead surface ECG criteria analyzed. Echo-derived left ventricular (LV) geometries were assessed through standardized methods. We used nonparametric trend tests for comparing continuous variables across different groups with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves constructed from both ECG and biomarkers for identifying echo-defined ventricular remodeling and hypertrophy. Results: Of all 364 subjects under survey, several ECG-based parameters demonstrated continuous changes in an ordered fashion across different groups (all p＜0.05) which paralleled those observed from biomarkers and echo-derived LV geometric changes and function. NT-ProBNP alone identified echo-derived LV hypertrophy (LVH) better than hs-CRP (AUC: 0.72 vs. 0.62, respectively, both p＜0.05) while neither showed satisfactory result in identifying concentric remodeling. The ROC area under curve in identifying LVH showed comparative result between some electrocardiography (ECG) parameters and NT-ProBNP, with Cornell product revealed to have the highest predictive value (AUC: 0.73, p＜0.05). Conclusion: Surface ECG yielded ability comparable to that of NT-ProBNP in identifying LVH. LV geometric remodeling, when defined by surface ECG, seemed to progress in subjects from normal, pre-hypertension to hypertension. This evidence suggests that aggressive control of blood pressure may he helpful at an earlier stage.",

The clinical outcomes of patients receiving different antithrombitic therapies and the efficacy and safety of two different intensities of warfarin therapy with a target INR of ＜2.0 or a target INR of ≥2.0 were compared.Results: A total of 815 patients were enrolled consecutively, and were followed for an average of 2.5 years. Among them, 226 patients (28%) received warfarin therapy and 512 (63%), antiplatelet therapy whereas, 77 (9%) of the patients received none of the antithrombotic therapy. The overall event rates were 3.6 per 100 person-years with warfarin, 6.0 per 100 person-years with antiplatelet therapy, and 10.1 per 100 person-years with no treatment (p=0.013). Although there was no significant difference in the frequencies of ischemic stroke between the two different intensities of warfarin therapy, noticeably more bleeding episodes occurred to the conventional-intensity group than the low-intensity one.Conclusion: The results of our study clearly demonstrated how Taiwanese patients with high-risk nonvalvular AF benefited from warfarin therapy in reducing adverse clinical outcomes; however, the low-intensity treatment was proved to be as effective as that of conventional-intensity but less likely to cause any bleeding during the treatment.",

Methods: EAT volume was measured using cardiac multi-slice computed tomography. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) was determined by the Agatston Score, and plasma visfatin levels were measured by a competitive enzyme immunoassay. Results: Patients with CAC and coronary atherosclerosis had significantly larger EAT volumes than patients without CAC and coronary atherosclerosis.

Although E/regional e' correlated linearly with LVFP, it was not a sufficient correlation to identify an elevated LVFP in AMI. For purposes of assessing LVFP, average e' was no better than regional e'. Regarding culprit lesions, the correlation between E/regional e' and LVFP was weaker in the single left anterior descending artery (LAD)-culprit AMI than in any other culprit or in multiple- vessel disease. Comparisons of LV ejection fraction (LVEF) revealed weak correlations between LVFP and E/regional e' in patients with LVEF of45-55%. Severe pulmonary edema and respiratory failure were significantly associated with LVEF (for pulmonary edema, OR 0.944, 95% CI 0.908-0.982, p=0.004; for respiratory failure, OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.910-0.993, p=0.022) and LVFP (for pulmonary edema, OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.074-1. 190, P＜0.0001; for respiratory failure, OR 1.077, 95% CI 1.02 1- 1.135, p = 0.006).

For patients diagnosed with PAH, the prognosis is poor, with an approximate 9-15% annual mortality rate. The goal of medical therapy is to improve survival and patients' quality of life. Although PAH is an incurable orphan disease with a high mortality rate, current treatment strategies have led to considerable gains, including exercise capacity, hemodynamic and time to clinical worsening. General disease management options include avoidance of salt in the diet, oxygen, appropriate vaccinations and routine health maintenance, and avoidance of pregnancy. Traditional treatments include warfarin, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers (if patients are deemed ”responders” during cardiac catheterization). Currently, three classes of drugs are approved for the treatment of PAH based on results from clinical trials-prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Clinical practice patterns have shifted in favor of earlier diagnosis, aggressive front line treatment, and upfront versus stepwise combination therapy. Future drug development targeting other molecular pathways of pulmonary vascular disease is essential for advancing our understanding of this disease.

The aim of this study was to investigate the change in costs, patient numbers, and the quality of care before and after reimbursement for the Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO).Methods: In this retrospective time series survey, we searched the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan from 1996 to 2007. Files of inpatient expenditures by admissions were analyzed. The patient numbers, age, comorbidity, lengths of stay and costs were retrieved for analysis.Results: After review of records from 1996 to 2007, we noted that the cases of transcatheter closure dramatically increased in 2004 after NHI began covering the fee for the ASO. However, when the cost of surgery increased 50% during the study period, the transcatheter approach had a 20% reduction of cost. The total expenditure for treating secundum-type ASD increased more than 4 times. The average length of stay decreased from 14.9 days in 1996 to 4.2 days in 2007.Conclusion: In conclusion, when a new minimally invasive technology was introduced into a closed system, patient numbers surged for a short period of time because more patients with uncomplicated heart disease were willing to undergo intervention. The length of stay was dramatically shortened and costs were reduced for individual patients in a basically fee-for-service system.",

    "abstract": "Background: Total repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) during young infancy had been recently advocated, but recent outcomes leave this question undecided.Methods: Between 1992 and 2002, 259 consecutive TOF patients received total repair in our hospital. To avoid confounding by previous shunt operations. we excluded those patients receiving staged shunt operation in the following analysis. Therefore, a total of 217 TOF patients who received one stage total repair before age 3 in 0ur hospital were enrolled (early group: 38 patients 0-6 months old; late group: 179 patients 6months-3 years old). We reviewed the medical records and confirmed the patients' survival status from the National Health Database.Results: Baseline characteristics showed fewer emergent operations (1.7% vs. 13.2%, p = 0.005) and fewer transannular patches required (70.9% vs. 86.8%、p = 0.029) in the late group. However, the early group had longer intubation periods and intensive care stays. After the 1994 patient-years follow-up, the 10-year actuarial survival and reintervention-free survival rate was 97.4% and 89.4%, respectively in the early group, and 95.5% and 93 .5% respectively in late group, which showed no statistically significant difference. The major risk factor for reintervention was small pulmonary artery size. Severe pulmonaly regurgitation correlated with transannular patch, which tended to be higher in the early group.Conclusion: Although patients with TOF repaired within first 6 months of life had prolonged postopcrative recovery and an increased chance of transannular patch usage, outcomes were comparable to those patients with TOF repaired later. Therefore, symptomatic infants can receive total repair of TOF early to avoid the need for use of a palliative shunt. However, when total repair is undertaken on an elective basis, the procedure may be delayed until the patient is older than 6 months of age.",

The goal of this current study is to describe the postoperative respiratory care and the current outcomes of the patients that underwent ASO for TGA at our institute. Method: We retrospectively enrolled 28 patients (23 males and 5 females) with TGA, who underwent ASO in this institution between January 2006 and December 2008, and analyzed some parameters. The outcome measurements were length of ventilator support, re-intervention rate and survival during hospitalization. Results: Ages and body weights at ASO were 17.2 32.3 days (median, 5 days; range, 0-158 days) and 3.1 0.6 kg (median, 3; 1.3-5 kg), respectively. Partial cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) time was 231.8 56.9 (163.0-377.0) minutes, total CPB time 192.8 56.1 (134.0-308.0) minutes and aortic cross-clamp time 125.3 36.0 (62.0-194.0) minutes. In this cohort, the mean ventilator duration was 12.8 14.3 days (median, 7; range, 2-61) for all patients and 11.2 11.3 days (median, 7; range, 3-50) for survivors. Yearly report showed that median ventilator duration was 17.5 days and survival was 73% in 2006, 8.6 days of ventilation and 100% survival in 2007, and 6.4 days of ventilation and 91% survival in 2008. Multivariate analysis showed patients with aortic coarctation had longer ventilation durations, possibly related to increased lung fluid caused by cardiopulmolnary bypass and increased left ventricular afterload. A higher re-intervention rate was found in patients with ventilation support > 14 days (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Ventilation duration shortened and survival rate increased gradually from 2006 to 2008. Patients with aortic coartation had longer ventilator support. Cardiorespiratory investigation or intervention was indicated in patients who required ventilation support more than 14 days postoperatively.",

The present study was aimed to investigate the prevalence of hypertension subtypes, ISH in particular, and also the rates of hypertension awareness, treatment and control in Kinmen County.\nMethod: The fieldwork of a community-based survey was carried out in Kinmen during 1991-1992. A total of 12,396 residents aged 30 years and older were interviewed and their blood pressure measured.\nResults: The prevalence was 35.2% for hypertension and 12.6% for ISH in Kinmen. The most common hypertension subtype was systolic/diastolic hypertension (SDH). The rates of awareness, treatment, and control of high blood pressure were 31.5%, 21.7%, and 4.0%, respectively. The prevalence of ISH in the hypertensive subjects was below 50% until seventh decade. The proportion of SDH dominated in both the untreated and inadequately treated hypertensive individuals until the age of 60 or 70 years, respectively. Sixty-one percent and 37.2% of the inadequately treated elderly (age≥50 years) didn't reach treatment goals for SBP and DBP, respectively. In contrast, 34.6% and 40.9% of the inadequately treated younger individuals (age＜50 years) did not reach treatment target for SBP and DBP, respectively.\nConclusions: ISH was predominant in the elderly, but SDH was the most prevalent subtype of uncontrolled hypertension in Kinmen. The distinct patterns of systolic and diastolic hypertension were probably related to the low awareness, treatment, and control rates of hypertension. More efforts would be required to improve hypertension control in Kinmen.",

Several articles reported prolongation of QT interval or ventricular arrhythmias in patients receiving arsenic trioxide. However, the effects on other electrocardiogram (ECG) have not been determined. Methods: Three-channel ECG (leads II, V1 and V5) was recorded from adult Hartley guinea pigs (400-600gm). The P wave, PR interval and QRS duration were measured at baseline condition just before the administration of various doses (10 mg/Kg, 30 mg/Kg, and 50 mg/Kg) of arsenic trioxide or water (control group) via nasogastric tube, and every 30 minutes until 3 hours. The effect of intravenous arsenic trioxide was also tested. Arsenic trioxide, 0.15 mg/Kg, 0.45 mg/Kg, and 1.5 mg/Kg, were infused for duration of 2 hours. The control group received equivalent volume of saline. The ECG parameters were measured immediately before infusion, at 10 minutes after, and every 30 minutes after infusion for a total of 2 hours. Results: Both oral and intravenous arsenic trioxide increased P wave, PR interval and QRS duration in guinea pigs. The percent increase was dose-dependent, and time-dependent, and was more prominent in PR interval compared with those in the P wave and QRS duration. There was no change in the control group. Atrioventricular block was observed in high-dose group. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that oral and intravenous arsenic trioxide prolonged P wave, PR interval and QRS duration. Routine regular ECG follow-up in patients receiving arsenic trioxide therapy may be indicated, especially in patients who already have prolongation of P wave, PR interval, or bundle branch block, or receiving concomitant administration of sodium channel blockers.",

    "abstract": "Background: Conventional renal artery angioplasty is performed through femoral artery access. Femoral artery access requires several hours of bed rest to ensure hemostasis, and combined vascular complications are frequently encountered. It has been proven that the transradial approach for coronary artery intervention is technically safe and feasible. In this study, we used this alternative approach for percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and stenting (PTRS). Methods: Twenty patients with 21 renal artery stenotic lesions were treated via the left radial artery approach. The intervention was carried out using a 6 French (Fr) system for PTRA and PTRS. Result: The immediate procedural success was 100% (three PTRAs and eighteen PTRSs). Direct stenting was performed in 8/21 stenoses; predilatation was necessary in 10/21. The only major complication was one renal artery perforation with perirenal hematoma requiring transfusion. There was no procedure-related death or cerebrovascular event. One patient with severe coronary artery disease suffered from sudden death 1 month after the intervention. Angiographic follow-up was obtained in 7 patients with 8 renal arteries treated (38.1%) after a mean 11.0±7.8 months. There was one angiographic instent restenosis (12.5%), which required a repeat balloon angioplasty. Clinical follow-up at a mean of 14.3±14.5 months revealed that renal function had improved in 4 (21.0%), had remained stable in 9 (47.4%), and had worsened in 6 (31.6%). Hypertension was found to have reversed in 1 (5.3%), to have improved in 5 (26.3%), and to have remained unchanged in 13 (68.4%). Conclusions: Transradial renal artery intervention is technically feasible and safe. An additional advantage is the ease with which hemostasis is achieved and the elimination of bleeding complications that allow immediate ambulation after the procedure. Therefore, transradial approach can be considered as an alternative to traditional transfemoral approach for renal artery intervention.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measured by conventional Doppler method has been reported to be an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, a clinical device has been developed to measure ABI by an oscillometric method. It is unclear whether ABI measured by this device can serve as a significant predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with CAD. Materials and Methods: We included 82 patients from our outpatient clinic, who had received coronary angiography examination. ABI was determined in all subjects using the ABI-form (Cohn VP1000) device. The lower value of ABI in either of the right or left limbs was used for data analysis. We divided our subjects into two groups with either ABI＜0.9 or ABI≥0.9 and compared basal characteristics between groups. We followed up these patients for 20.0±3.6 months (range 10 to 26). We analyzed the relationship between ABI and cardiovascular events. Then, we used univariate analysis to determine the significant predictors of cardiovascular events. Finally, we utilized multiple logistic regression analysis to identify the independent predictors of cardiovascular events. Results: There were 14 patients with ABI ＜ 0.9 and 68 patients with ABI≥0.9. The patients with ABI ＜ 0.9 were older and had higher plasma level of uric acid. The prevalence of three-vessel CAD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, diuretic use, and the risk of cardiovascular death and cardiovascular events were significantly higher in the group of patients with ABI ＜ 0.9. In a univariate analysis, cardiovascular events were significantly related to ABI ＜ 0.9 (odds ratio: 12.6), three-vessel CAD (odds ratio: 12.5) and DM (odds ratio: 4.7). After a multiple logistic regression analysis, ABI ＜ 0.9 and three-vessel CAD were still significant predictors of cardiovascular events. Conclusions: ABI measured by the automated oscillometric method, like three-vessel CAD, can serve as a useful parameter to predict cardiovascular events in patients with CAD.",

    "abstract": "The premature neonate who has a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with significant left-to-right shunt presents serious problems in management. Pharmacologic closure of the PDA with indomethacin seems to be the preferred initial treatment, with a high degree of success in many reports. However, indomethacin may increase the risk of brain intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis and renal failure. Besides, since indomethacin is not always successful, surgical intervention will be the definite subsequent therapeutic treatment. Many studies have proved that there is no increasing morbidity and mortality of surgical ligation of PDA in premature infants. Moreover, surgical ligation shortens the average duration of intubation period, unstable hemodynamic status, need of digoxin and diuretic and achieved gastrointestinal and renal function sooner after operation, especially in the extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates (< 1000 gm). Dr. Hwang and his colleagues have performed excellent work for the treatment of PDA in premature infants with ELBW. The result is as good as that of many other reports. Although most of those studies have pointed out that surgical intervention will not increase the mortality and morbidity, this study presents four deaths within very short mean duration between postoperative death and surgery (4.3 days) in the group of surgery alone. It’s hard to say there was no correlation with surgery. Whereas, it probably means those premature neonates were quite sick. There was no treatment but surgery. Dr. Trus and his colleagues have suggested that primary surgical ligation may provide the optimal management of PDA in carefully selected patients with extremely low birth weight less than 800 gm and larger LA/AO ratio ( 1.5), who have high failure rate and significant complication in treatment with indomethacin. Since transportation of critically ill, unstable infants from neonatal intensive case unit (NICU) to operation room creates problems, such as body temperature loss, vascular line disconnection, and inadequate ambulatory ventilation, which may increase surgical mortality and morbidity. Many reports have recommended performing the PDA ligation at the bedside of NICU. The studies indicated that it was safer and easier than transport to an operating room. In addition, an experienced team which consisted of a pediatric cardiac anesthesiologist and nurse anesthetist, cardiac operating room nurses, a pediatric cardiac surgeon and a cardiac surgical fellow, could even performed the NICU beside PDA ligation in off-site referring institutes to minimize the risk of the transportation inconvenience. In Dr. Hwang’s study, only one of 22 infants underwent PDA ligation at the NICU bedside, presenting no increased mortality and morbidity compared with the results of the group treated with indomethacin. The impressive outcome means excellent team work. However, what Dr. Hwang didn’t mention is any complication or death caused by the transportation to the operating room. I would like to recommend bedside ligation of PDA to such an outstanding team. The bedside procedure is not only safe and effective but also less costly for hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disorder, caused by immunologic destruction and insufficient compensatory production of platelets. The management and treatment of ITP depends on estimated risks including platelet count, symptomatic severity, and duration of disease.1 One of the more recent second-line therapies for enhancing platelet production in patients with ITP is the use of thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), such as eltrombopag.1 However, some randomized controlled trials have reported severe adverse effects of arterial and venous thromboembolic events from using TPO-RA, but the pathophysiology and risk factors have not been well elucidated.2 Regarding thromboembolic events, a clinical dilemma arises when a patient with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presents with ITP from TPO-RA treatment because a balance must be maintained between bleeding events and thromboembolism. Here, we report a case of recurrent fatal coronary thrombosis in a middle-aged woman with chronic ITP on eltrombopag.",

However, the Achilles heel of heart transplantation is the shortage of organ donors. Thus, nontransplant surgical alternatives are necessary to treat many of the patients who progress to intractable Class III, or especially Class IV, heart failure. Methods: Two hundred and twelve consecutive patients (57 women and 155 men; average age 64 12 years old) who underwent surgical revascularization with or without combined mitral repair (or replacement) and left ventricular reconstruction between 1999 and 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The in-hospital or 30-day mortality rate was 6.60%. At a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 6-88 months), 48.7 % of the patients were alive at 5 years. Conclusion: The results of our study confirm that surgical revascularization with or without combined mitral repair (or replacement) and left ventricular reconstruction for patients with severe LV dysfunction are presently the common and promising surgical approaches, with surprisingly low operative mortality and encouraging intermediate results.",

    "abstract": "Background: The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been well established to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Due to the increasingly high medical expenses in Taiwan, the government has tried several measures to combat this problem. One of the strategies is to promote the utilization of generic drug products. The purpose of this study was to clarify the lipid-lowering effect and cost-effectiveness during conversion of the brand-name simvastatin product (Zocor(superscript ®)) to its generic simvastatin product (Zolotin(superscript ®)) in Taiwanese patients. Method: Electronic data in E-Da Hospital were collected from all patients actively converted from Zocor (20mg/tablet, Merck Sharp & Dohme Pty. Ltd., Australia) to Zolotin(superscript ®) (20mg/tablet, Genelabs Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Taiwan) between January 31, 2005, and July 31, 2006. The dosage of simvastatin remained the same when the Zocor(superscript ®) was converted to Zolotin(superscript ®). The primary effectiveness end point was to compare the preconversion and postconversion low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The annual price per reduction of 1% of LDL-C with Zocor(superscript ®) and Zolotin(superscript ®) was also compared. Result: A total of 83 patients were enrolled in this study. No significant difference was found in the LDL-C level before and after the conversion. The mean LDL-C- lowering efficacies with Zocor(superscript ®) and Zolotin(superscript ®) were -34.7±15.7% and -36.3 ± 17.7%, respectively (P=NS). However, the HDL-C level after treatment was significantly higher with Zocor(superscript ®) (52.8 ± 12.0 mg/dL vs. 49.8 ± 11.9 mg/dL, P=0.0045). There was no patient in this study with elevated transaminase ＞ 3x upper limit of normal (ULN) value or CK ＞ 10x ULN value under both statin treatments. The average annual cost for reduction of 1% of LDL-C with Zocor(superscript ®) and Zolotin(superscript ®) were 541.0 ± 910.0 New Taiwan dollar (TWD) and 557.0 ± 626.6 TWD, respectively (P=NS). Conclusion: There was no significant difference of the LDL-C lowering efficacy after converting the brand-name simvastatin to the generic product in Taiwan. This study also implicated that it might not be more cost-effective to convert brand-name simvastatin to the generic product in Taiwan if the price of generic drug was not lowered significantly.",

Tissue factor (TF) exposure upon plaque rupture can trigger thrombin formation. Thrombin, on the other hand, can induce tissue factor expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells or saphenous vein endothelial cells. The impact of thrombin in the endothelial cells of arterial side was less known. Methods: Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were cultivated and methoxyphenyl tetrazolium inner salt assays were used to determine the non-toxicity of thrombin to endothelial cells. Real-time PCR was used to determine the relative TF mRNA quantity. Western blot was used to determine the relative protein level. TF functional activity was determined by a chromogenic assay. Results: Thrombin was non-toxic to the HAEC. TF mRNA relative quantity was enhanced 390 114 by thrombin (P = 0.034). TF protein relative quantity was enhanced 332 39 by thrombin (P = 0.01). TF activity was enhanced 547 54 by thrombin (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Thrombin is a sufficient stress to induce TF expression in HAEC. The transcriptional control by thrombin causes an increase in TF mRNA. This increase in mRNA is modestly paralleled by an increase in protein level and functional activity.",

Methods: We enrolled 95 patients (19 with corollary arterial disease). All underwent conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging within 30 minutes before and after hemodialysis (H/D). We measured the ratio of the early-diastolic velocity of mitral inflow (E) to the early-diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus (Em) Patients received 4-year follow-up for major events (any-cause mortality and nonfatal cardiovascular events requiring hospitalization). Results: Thirteen deaths and 11 nonfatal major events occurred. The prevalence of underlying coronary arterial disease was higher in patients with major events than in others (33% vs. 7%), as was the degree of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction 46%±10 vs. 52%±8). Baseline E/Em, either pre-dialytic or post-dialytic, was significantly lower in event-free patients (pre-dialytic 9.9±3.0 vs. 12.2±4.0, p=0.01; post-dialytic 9.2±2.9 vs. 12.3±3.6, p=0.002). On Cox regression, factors significantly affecting outcomes were age, LV ejection fraction, LV mass index (hazard ratio [HR]=1.021, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.001-1.039, p=0.021), and post-dialytic E/Em≥12 (HR=3.054, 95% CI 1.118-11.184, p=0.009). Conclusion: Like LV dysfunction and LV mass index, a high post-dialytic E/Em was prognostic of major events.",

    "abstract": "Background: Statin therapy prior to or soon after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with improved clinical outcome in those patients. Recent trials have demonstrated that drug-eluting stent (DES) can reduce stent failure due to restenosis. The objective of this study was to determine whether starting statin treatment prior to PCI with DES reduced periprocedural myonecrosis and improved clinical outcome. Methods: A total of 161 patients (aged 66.2±10.6 years, M/F=116/45) with stable or unstable angina pectoris who underwent PCI with DES were enrolled. Statin therapy was administered at the discretion of the attending physician. We compared the pen-procedural serum levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and MB-fraction of creatine phosphokinase (CK-MB), the incidence of myonecrosis, defined as elevation of peak CK-MB above upper limit of normal within 24 hours after the index procedure, and the major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rates up to 9 months between the statin-treated (statin group; n=63) and non-statin-treated (non-statin group; n=98) patients. Major adverse cardiovascular events were defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, or re-intervention procedure. Results: The baseline and procedural data were similar in both groups. However, statin-treated patients were more likely to have hyperlipidemia (81.0% vs. 62.2%; P=0.01), younger age (61.9 years vs. 69.0 years; P＜0.0001), and longer lesion length (22.07mm vs. 17.30mm; P=0.05) than non-statin-treated patients. Postprocedural peak levels of CK-MB (10.32IU/L vs. 17.05IU/L; P=0.04) and the incidence of myonecrosis (24% vs. 46%; P=0.05) were significant lower in the statin group than those in the non-statin group. Within a 9-month period, receiving statin therapy was not associated with a significant reduction of MACE (log rank test, P=0.44). Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that starting statin therapy before PCI with DES can reduce periprocedural myonecrosis. Whether statin therapy can improve long-term clinical outcome in those patients needs to be confirmed in larger prospective randomized trials.",

The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the prevalence, angiographic characteristics, and the natural history of coronary artery fistulas in Southern Taiwan adult patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization and compare with results from Western countries. Methods and Results: Of 4300 patients who had diagnostic cardiac catheterization, 14(0.3%) had coronary artery fistulas, with totally 20 fistulas in angiograms, with males predominant (12/14, 85.7%). Only one patient was found to have a continuous murmur. Most of the fistulas were single (9/20, 64.2%). Ten fistulas (50%) originated from the left anterior descending artery, 5 from the right, 4 from the circumflex and 1 from the left main coronary artery, respectively. The majority of the fistulas (15/20, 75%) drained into the pulmonary artery. There were one-third of patients (5/14, 35.7%) with occlusive coronary artery disease but with less other congenital anomalies. The men ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow was 1.25±0.15. Neither significant oxygen step-up nor combination of congenital heart abnormalities was noted. During a mean follow-up period of 6.3 years (range from 6 months to 10 years), there were no complications related to coronary artery fistula. Conclusions: In conclusion, the prevalence rate of coronary artery fistulas detected during routine diagnostic coronary angiography is very low in Southern Taiwan. Most of our patients are male in sex. The coronary artery fistulas originate predominantly from the left coronary artery and drain into pulmonary artery. In our series, the fistulas were not associated with hemodynamic abnormalities or other congenital heart diseases. The prognosis of coronary artery fistulas in adults is good.",

    "abstract": "A survey is made to autologous arterial grafts for coronary arterial bypass grafting. Articles were collected by searching MEDLINE database. Search terms included arterial graft and coronary bypass. Reports regarding the commonly used arterial grafts, including the internal mammary artery (IMA), as well as the radial, right gastroepiploic, and inferior epigastric arteries, were screened in order to highlight their morphologic characteristics, patency rates, advantages and drawbacks, while a comprehensive collection was made on those grafts with merely a scattering of cases, such as the subscapular, ulnar, splenic, and lateral costal arteries. The patency rate of pedicled left and right IMAs were similar. Pedicled IMA had a higher patency than free IMA graft. Higher incidence of sternal infection was found in patients with bilateral IMAs bypassed. A skeletonized IMA would supply a better sternal perfusion, but may cause a focal injury during harvest. An increased risk of graft failure of the IMA is associated with grafting low-grade stenosed or non-left anterior descending coronary arteries. The superiority of the IMA over other conduits might be due to its superior endothelial function and flow remodeling. The IMA is elastic, while others are muscular. The patency rates were 88.9% for the IMA at 20-year, 85% for the radial artery at 5-year, 85.7% for the right gastroepiploic artery at 5-year, and 52.2% for the inferior epigastric artery at 21.2-month follow-up, respectively. Other grafts had fewer reports, but showed good results. In the graft selection for coronary bypass, the primary choice is the left IMA; the second choice is the right IMA; and the radial artery is the third choice. Other arteries could be used as additional grafts.",

This case illustrates that the parainfluenza virus might have a causative role in acute myopericarditis in which the clinical course is fulminant.",

In this article, we report on a 12-year-old boy who suffered from recurrent facial palsy as the initial clinical manifestation, which resolved spontaneously within several days of hospital admission. The predisposing factor of the symptom was physical exercise. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed encephalomalacia and multiple cystic changes compatible with an old infarction over the left caudate nucleus, head-body junction and the left put amen. Echocardiography revealed a tumor mass on the left atrium, and surgical intervention was performed. The pathologic al finding revealed cardiac myxoma, and a diagnosis of intracardiac myxoma associated with brain infarction and recurrent facial palsies was made. During the three year follow-up, no residual cardiac myxoma or recurrent facial palsy were noted. Although cardiac myxoma associated with stroke rarely occurs in children, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with paroxysmal neurologic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Cardiovascular disease is prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Additionally, patients with CKD have elevated levels of p-cresylsulfate (PCS), which have been linked to vascular impairment and hypercoagulability in the CKD population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of CKD in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients and to investigate whether a significant correlation exists between CKD, total PCS, and coronary atherosclerotic burden in ACS patients.Methods: 221 consecutive ACS patients and 93 non-coronary artery disease controls were tested to establish total serum PCS concentration levels, which were measured using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). Thereafter, their associations with angiographic indices of the number of diseased vessels and modified Gensini score were estimated. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ＜ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m^2.Results: ACS patients had increased median total serum PCS levels related to patients with normal coronary arteries. When the patients were divided into 4 groups on the basis of their CKD status and total PCS level, patients with high total PCS (＞ 1.26 mg/L) levels and CKD had significantly increased numbers of diseased vessels and Gensini score. By multivariate analysis, high total serum total PCS level and CKD were independently associated with ACS. Furthermore, the odds ratio for stenotic vessel disease in the group with both CKD and high total PCS level was 4.100 relative to the group without CKD and a low total PCS level (p = 0.0003).Conclusion: Our study suggests that total PCS is related to the extent of coronary atherosclerosis, and might play a role in the consequence of plaque vulnerability in ACS patients with low eGFR.",

LVH was defined by the following three sets of sex-specific criteria: left ventricular mass (LVM) indexed to body surface area; LVM indexed to height; and LVM indexed to height^(2.7).Reslllts: In the mild CKD group, LVM indexed to height^(2.7) detected 14 in 15 LVH patients; however, LVM indexed to BSA and height detected 9 and 7 patients, respectively. In the moderate/severe CKD group, LVM indexed to height^(2.7) detected 42 in 43 LVH patients; however, LVM indexed to BSA and height both detected 29 patients. In the moderate/severe CKD group, patients with LVH who fulfilled all three criteria at the same time had lower Em and Am and higher mitral E/Em and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) than those patients without LVH. Among patients without LVH, moderate/severe CKD patients had significantly higher mitral E/Em and longer IVRT than in mild CKD. In multivariable regression analysis, the independent predictors of septal E/Em ＞ 15 were CKD severity (odds ratio = 3.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.64-6.08, P = 0.001) and LVH indexed by height^(2.7) (odds ratio = 4.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.27-1 3.32, P =. 0.019).Conclusion: LVH indexed by height^(2.7) could detect most of the LVH in predialysis CKD patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although hyperuricemia is associated with cardiovascular disease, such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and hypertension, whether or not including it among tradition al risk factors improves the ability to better predict cardiac mortality and total cause of death rates remains controversial.Methods and Remits: This was an observational study based on 57,100 participants without overt cardiovascular disease who were enrolled during routine health examinations at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, The participants' mean age was 52.3 ± 13.4 years. Researchers estimated their scrum concentrations of uric acid, and the study used future cardiac and all-cause death as the primary endpoints. During an average follow-up period of 5.4±3.0years, there were 1,889 deaths, including 231 cardiac deaths among the study subjects. In a multivariable-adjusted analysis with traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratio of cardiac death associated with hyperuriccmia was 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-2.22) and 1.60 (95% CI: 0.95-2.71) respectively, for males and females. The hazard ratio for death from all causes associated with hyperuricemia was 1.12(95% CI: 1.00-1.26) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.17-1.70) for males and females, respectively. The addition of hyperuricemia to the roster of traditional risk factors for cardiac death increased the C statistic from 0.79 (95% CL, 0.76-0.82) to 0.80 (95% CL, 0.77-0 .83) for males, and increased it from 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.92) to 0.89 (95% CL, 0.85-0.92) for females; however, neither had statistical significance. Furthermore, adding hyperuricemia to known risk factors produced an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.009 and -0.0003 respectively, for males and females, with a 4.11% improvement according to net reclassification analysis (p=0.102), and 0.13% improvement according to net reclassification improvement (p=0.484).Conclusion: Our results suggest that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for predicting cardiac or all-cause death, although it had borderline significance for females in cardiac death models. However, adding hyperuricemia to traditional cardiac risk prediction models did not significantly improve the ability of the model to predict the risk of cardiac or all-cause death, regardless of whether we used ROC analysis or reclassification methods. Therefore, hyperuricemia per se should not be designated as a treatment target for reducing cardiac or even all-cause death in the general Taiwanese population.",

Real-time 3D echocardiography (RT30E) may be a superior index for estimating LA volume, compared with traditional M-mode and 20 methods. In this study, we used RT3DE to evaluate phasic LA volumes and functions among different age groups of healthy Taiwanese subjects.Methods: Sixty-eight healthy volunteers were divided into three groups according to age. Group 1: under 40 years old (n = 20); group 2: 40-60 years old (n = 24); and group 3: over 60 years old (n = 24). RT3DE of LA volume was acquired from the apical view. Three phasic LA volumes, including maximal LA volume (LAVmax), minimal LA volume (LAVmin) and LA volume before atrial contraction (LAVpreA) were measured. These phasic LA volumes were used to calculate the emptying volume and emptying fraction at different phases of one heart cycle.Results: There were significantly positive correlations between age and LA volumes (p = 0.639 for LAVmax, p = 0.642 for LAVpreA, p = 0.661 for LAVmin; all p ＜ 0.001). Total LA empty volume (p ＜ 0.001) and active LA empty volume (p = 0.001) also positively correlated with age. In contrast, total, passive and active LA emptying fractions were not significantly different among the three age groups.Conclusion: Aging has a significant effect on phasic LA volumes, but phasic LA empty fractions remain unchanged in healthy Taiwanese adults.",

Whether the combination of these two parameters could also predict the clinical outcomes in de-novo LMCA patients undergoing bypass surgery remains unknown.Method: From April 2003 to June 2008, 86 patients with de-novo LMCA disease undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) were studied. Patients were divided into three subgroups of global risk classification (GRC), low-risk group (n = 44), intermediate-risk group (n = 28), and high-risk group (n = 14) according to their SYNTAX score and EuroSCORE, The baseline characteristics were compared between different risk subgroups of GRC. The differences of clinical outcomes in terms of major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) between different risk subgroups of GRC were compared.Results: Compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk group showed a significantly higher proportion of myocardial infarction (50.0% vs. 18.2%), congestive heart failure (21.4% vs. 2.3%), and cardiogenic shock (7.1 % vs. 0.0%; p = 0.02), higher SYNTAX score (48.7 ± 5.6 vs. 27.5 ± 6.8; p ＜ 0.0 1), higher EuroSCORE (7.7±1.9 vs. 2.7 ± 1.5; p ＜ 0.0 1), a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (85.7% vs. 43.2%; p = 0.02), prior stroke (28.6% vs. 4.6%; p = 0.03), and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (28.6% vs. 2.3%: p ＜ 0.01), and lower ejection fraction (50.8 ± 17.4 vs. 66.5 ± 14. 1, p ＜ 0.01). Using multivariable Cox-regression proportional regression with the forward conditional method, the global risk classification (GRC) predicted long-term cumulative MACCEs (p ＜ 0.01, HR 4.45, 95% CI: 2.48-7.99). The Kaplan-Meier Curve with log-rank test displayed significant differences of long-term MACCEs (p ＜ 0.01; χ^2= 39.08) between different subgroups of GRC.Conclusion: The new GRC system effectively predicts long-term MACCEs of de-novo LMCA disease patients undergoing CABG.",

We sought to investigate the association between ACE I/D polymorphism, and the risk of VTE in a Chinese population living in Taiwan.Methods: 176 patients with VTE and 321 age and sex-matched controls were analyzed for the ACE I/D polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction.Results: The genotype distribution of the ACE 1/D polymorphism was not statistically different between the VTE affected subjects and the group of unaffected subjects (p = 0.057).

Herein, we describe the first case where CAA developed after titanium nitric oxide-coated bioactive stent implantation. Several mechanisms may account for stent-related CAA formation, including mechanical trauma, vessel remodeling, acute myocardial infarction, long or multiple DES stent implantation, DES malapposition and hypersensitivity reaction to polymers.A 53-year-old man presented initially with recent MI and ongoing chest pains. Coronary angiography revealed a 90% occlusion of the middle left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). PCI was performed on the patient, and a titanium nitric oxide-coated bioactive stent was implanted. Due to a positive thallium scan 28 months later, a follow-up coronary angiography scan revealed a true CAA, which was then further confirmed by intravascular ultrasound. Thereafter, the patient remained asymptomatic at subsequent follow-ups, and continued medical treatment without further intervention.

We need an early risk stratification method for this population. A risk score formula to estimate the probability of advanced atherosclerosis using coronary heart disease risk factors was developed for persons 15-34 years of age by the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study. This study's aim was to investigate the relation between PDAY risk score and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and inflammation markers in asymptomatic young FH subjects.Methods: We included 23 heterozygous FH patients (mean age 27) and 22 healthy control subjects (mean age 33). We computed the PDAY risk scores and measured the high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and carotid IMT.Results: In FH subjects, univariate analysis showed PDAY risk score was significant correlated with hsCRP and carotid IMT. Comparing FH subjects with the presence of carotid atheroma plaque (IMT＞1 mm) or without the plaque (IMT＜1 mm), we found significantly higher PDAY risk score and hsCRP value in the presence group. By receiver operating characteristic curve, both hsCRP and PDAY risk score could predict the presence of carotid plaque. The multivariate analysis showed the correlation between PDAY risk score and carotid plaque (odds ratio for a 1-unit increase in the risk score was 1.161, 95% confidence interval: 1.027-1.312, p=0.017).Conclusion: In young heterozygous FH subjects, PDAY risk score is strongly correlated with carotid IMT, and it might be a simple and useful tool for cardiovascular disease risk stratification in this population.",

The clinical presentations are similar but treatment strategies are different between AMI due to thrombotic occlusion of coronary arteries and that secondary to aortic dissection. In the latter, emergency surgery is the first choice and thrombolytic therapy is absolutely contraindicated. We report a 44-year-old man, who suddenly developed acute anterior chest pain. The diagnosis at emergency room was inferior wall AMI and the patient was treated with thrombolysis followed by coronary intervention. However, aortic dissection was suspected during cardiac catheterization and then comfirmed by echocardiography. The patient underwent emergent cardiac surgery to repair the aortic wall and bypass the proximal portion of right coronary artery (RCA). The follow-up coronary angiogram 3 months later showed patent RCA. From this case, we learn that in patients with an AMI, the possibility of aortic dissection should be kept in mind. If there is any suspicion, echocardiography can serve as a safe and quick tool to detect the possibility.",

It is not known whether mutations in this gene are also responsible for Af in common clinical practice. Methods: We enrolled 100 consecutive patients with Af, as well as 50 normal individuals without Af. Total cellular DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes. Polymerase chain reactions were performed to amplify the translated region of the KvLQT1 gene. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography was subsequently used to screen for the presence of heteroduplexes, and DNA sequencing was applied to these heteroduplexes. Results: Among the 100 patients with Af, we identified six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including three intronic SNPs (in introns 1, 12, and 13, respectively), two synonymous SNPs (C435 to T and G1638 to A) and one non-synonymous SNP (C1343 to G with amino acid change P448 to R). Two of the intronic SNPs were present in only one patient with Af (intron 1 and intron 12). The other four SNPs were more common and were also present in normal individuals. The incidences of heterozygocity of the four common SNPs were not significantly different between normal individuals and patients of Af, nor were the incidences significantly different between patients with lone Af and patients with Af associated with organic heart disease. Conclusion: KvLQT1 mutation was not found in 100 patients with Af. Although common SNPs were identified, their incidences were not significantly different among normal individuals, patients with lone Af and patients with organic Af.",

    "abstract": "Regenerative medicine is a term given to varied strategies of repairing or replacing damaged or diseased tissues or organs to restore, maintain, or enhance their function. As the average age of the population is rising with the increasing incidence of age-related degenerative conditions, a pressing need for the products of regenerative medicine is imminent. Regenerative medicine promises a more effective solution than current pharmaceutical and interventional therapy. By far the most well-known areas of regenerative medicine have been tissue engineering and cell therapy. Engineering complex organs ex vivo by knowledge from tissue engineering is still many years away, but the use of cells to rebuild diseased or damaged tissues by delivering a small number of cells may soon be used to treat some of the world most devastating diseases. In this review, we first examine the knowledge of regeneration and tissue stem cells. We provide the most updated information about cardiac stem cells, myocyte death and growth and regeneration in diseased and aging heart. Recent research demonstrates replacement and regeneration of functional cardiac muscle can be achieved by either implanting competent cells or stimulating proliferation of endogenous stem cells. We therefore explore the scientific advances, clinical trials and challenges ahead regarding cell therapy for myocardial regeneration. Our goal is not to provide detailed information about regenerative medicine, but rather, using heart repair as an example, to inform the readership about recent advances in this promising field and encourage their active participation in its further development.",

    "abstract": "Background: Atrial septal defect (ASD) is easily thought to be a round hole in the atrial septum from the image of two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. Even surgeons can not get the true morphology of an atrial septal defect because they only see the defect when the heart is already in a collapsed, non-beating condition. Pediatric interventional cardiologists, on the contrary, need to know the exact morphology in the beating heart so that a therapeutic device can be safely deployed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT-3D Echo) in visualizing the morphological characteristics of ASD and its potential as a new method for selecting the size of the Amplatzer septal occluder. Materials and Methods: Between February 2003 and December 2003, a total of 12 patients with secundum-type ASD underwent simultaneously 2D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and RT-3D Echo during interventional catheterization. The stretched balloon diameter, 2D TEE images, and RT-3D Echo images were recorded and analyzed in detail. Results: Twelve patients, aged from 3.0 to 36.0 years (mean 11.6±8.2 years), safely underwent the interventional catheterization. The mean Qp/Qs was 2.4±1.9 (range 1.6-4.5). The mean size (waist) of the 12 devices was 23.1±9.2 mm (range 7-36 mm). The mean SBD was 19.9±7.6 mm (range 6.0-34.1 mm). The mean 2D-TEE ASD measurement was 19.2±7.1 mm (range 5.4-33.5 mm). The mean RT-3D ASD measurement was 21.2±9.0 mm (range 6.1-34.5 mm). Analyses of the RT-3D Echo imaging showed that the ASD is not a flat hole in the septum. The ASD curves in three dimensions. The curvature varied differently in different directions, thus generating a complex spatial structure. The calculated curvature angles along long axis of defects were 166±5.4 degrees. Good correlations were found between device diameter (waist) and SBD (r=0.995), 2D diameter (r=0.987), and 3D diameter (r=0.997). The best correlation was found between device diameter (waist) and 3D diameter measured by planimetry of RT-3D Echo (r=0.997). Conclusions: The complex 3D nature of the ASD in the beating heart could only be well appreciated by the RT Color 3D Echo. The conventional 2D image provided only partial and thus distorted image of ASD. Thus, the application ofRT-3D Echo provides a useful tool for evaluation of ASD for those patients undergoing interventional transcatheter closure.",

Methods: From 1995 to 2003, a total of 15 patients (12 boys, 3 girls; mean age, 3.3 years) underwent biventricular repair for DORV. Among these patients, 8 patients received palliative procedures before definitive repair. According to the location of the VSD, these patients were divided into four groups: Five patients had subaortic VSD, 6 had subpulmonary VSD (Taussig-Bing type), 2 had doubly committed VSD, and 2 had remote VSD. In the subaortic, doubly committed, and non-committed VSD groups, the intraventricular baffle procedure to direct blood from the left ventricle to the aorta combined with right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction with or without extracardiac conduit implantation was performed. In the Taussig-Bing group, 4 patients underwent VSD closure and the Jatene operation, while 2 patients underwent VSD closure and the Mustard operation. Results: There was one early death, and no late death. One patient in the remote VSD group had complications of complete heart block and underwent pacemaker implantation. Patients were monitored for a mean period of 107.3±31.0 months (range, 66-164 months). Two patients underwent re-operation during the follow-up period.

Methods: From January 1994 to December 2006, a total of 81 infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm patients (14 ruptured aneurysms, 67 electives) were admitted to undergo operation. Patient who had thoraco-abdominal aneurysms, mycotic aneurysms, iatrogenic aneurysms, traumatic aneurysms, or patients who underwent other surgery at the same time were excluded from this study. The research was conducted based on review of medical records and interviews with patients. Results: Our cohort (N=81) had mean age of 71.0±7.6 year, female-to-male ratio of 13:68, follow-up duration of 5.2±3.3 years, and person-time of 420.3 person-years.

    "abstract": "Background: Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is a simple and non-invasive diagnostic tool and has been reported to be an indicator of arterial stiffness. However, it is still unclear whether PWV can accurately predict the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively included 120 patients from our OPD, who had ever received coronary angiography examination. BaPWV was measured in each subject. If the measuring baPWV was greater than the normal reference value (provided by Colin Corporation), the result was defined as positive; otherwise, it was defined as negative. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity and positive & negative predictive value in predicting CAD in all subjects. We also calculated the sensitivity in predicting one-vessel, two-vessel and three-vessel CAD. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between baPWV and other associated variables in patients with CAD. Results: Coronary artery disease defined as at least 50% diameter narrowing of a major coronary artery was present in 83/120 (69%) patients. The sensitivity, positive and negative predictive value of baPWV in predicting CAD in all patients were 62% (52/83), 29% (11/37), 66% (52/78) and 26% (11/42), respectively. The sensitivity in predicting one-vessel, two-vessel and three-vessel CAD were 57%(15/26), 55% (15/27), and 73% (22/30), respectively. After multiple linear regression analysis, age and systolic blood pressure are significantly correlated with the value of baPWV in patients with CAD. Conclusion: Although baPWV measurement is a simple and non-invasive method, the sensitivity and specificity of baPWV in predicting CAD were only 62% and 29% in patients under antihypertensive and antianginal drug treatment. Further large-scale studies which enrolled patients without medication and other associated diseases are necessary to define the more accurate sensitivity and specificity of baPWV in predicting CAD.",

    "abstract": "Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) provides outcomes superior to fibrinolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but no registry or study in Taiwan has demonstrated its use in hospital without on-site cardiac surgery. Objectives: To investigate the safety and outcome of primary PCI for AMI without on-site cardiac surgery. Methods: Between September 2003 and September 2005, 175 patients were diagnosed as AMI in the Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taitung Branch, in which there was no on-site cardiac surgical backup. Of them, those whose electrocardiograms showed ST-elevation or new left bundle branch block (LBBB) presented within 12 hours of symptom onset and treated with primary PCI and fibrinolysis were enrolled into the study. Data of clinical course and angiographic characteristics were recorded and analyzed. Results: There were 38 patients (64±13 years old, 6 females) treated with primary PCI for infarct-related artery (IRA), among which were left anterior descending artery (LAD), 40%, left circumflex artery (LCX), 5%, and right coronary artery (RCA), 55%. The stent rate was 82%, and no emergency coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) was needed. The angiographic success rate was 92%, and the procedural success rate was 97%. All patients survived at least 1 year, except 1 (3%), who died due to sepsis on day 46 of admission. Within 1 year of the PCI, 3 (8%) patients were transferred out for elective CABG, 3 (8%) patients had non-fatal MI, and 7 (18%) patients had re-IRA PCI, including 5 (13%) patients with in-stent restenosis, leaving the clinical success rate 71% at 1 year. There were 5 patients treated with fibrinolysis among which were left main (LM), 20%, LAD, 60%, and RCA, 20%. One of them underwent elective PCI to LAD. All patients survived at least 1 year, except 1 (20%), who had LM disease, was transferred to a tertiary center for emergency CABG at the next day of index MI, and died due to ventricular arrhythmia on day 44 post-operation. Conclusions: Primary PCI for patients with AMI having ST-elevation or new LBBB is a safe and effective strategy in Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taitung Branch, even without on-site cardiac surgery.",

It has been reported that transcatheter coil embolization is appropriate for symptomatic patients with a single fistula, safe accessibility to the feeding coronary artery, and the absence of large branch vessels. In this case report, we present a 4-year-old boy who was found by cardiac catheterization to have a huge isolated right coronary artery-to-right ventricle fistula. The patient initially presented at one year of age with an asymptomatic continuous grade Ⅱ/Ⅵ murmur over the left-lower sternal border. Echocardiography demonstrated a continuous turbulent flow in the right ventricle and a dilated aneurysmal right coronary artery, suggesting the presence of a right coronary artery fistula. As the patient was asymptomatic, he was followed closely without definitive treatment. Over the next three years, he gradually developed mild exertional dyspnea and decreased exercise tolerance. Serial electrocardiograms revealed biventricular hypertrophy, and echocardiography revealed progressive right coronary arterial dilatation. Cardiac catheterization eventually confirmed the diagnosis, and the fistula was occluded by percutaneous transcatheter coil embolization. The boy remained well after the procedure with resolution of his symptoms. In conclusion, coil embolization is a safe alternative for the treatment of coronary artery fistula.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. There is genetic predisposition for the development of AF. Recently, by linkage analysis, several loci have been mapped for monogenetic AF, which include 11p15.5, 21q22, 17q, 7q35-36, 5p13, 6q14-16, and 10q22. Some of these loci encode for subunits of potassium channels (KCNQ1, KCNE2, KCNJ2 and KCNH2 genes), and the remaining are yet unidentified. All of the mutations are associated with a gain of function of repolarization potassium currents, resulting in a shortening of action potential duration and atrial refractory period, which facilitate multiple reentrant circuits in AF. In addition to familial AF, common AF often occurs in association with acquired diseases such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, or heart failure. By genetic association study, some genetic variants or polymorphisms related to the mechanism of AF have been found to be associated with common AF, including genes encoding for subunits of potassium or sodium channels, sarcolipin, rennin –angiotensin -aldosterone system genes, connexin 40 gene, endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene, and interleukin 10 genes. These observations suggest that genes related to ionic channels, calcium-handling protein, fibrosis, conduction and inflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of common AF. The complete elucidation of genetic loci for common AF is still in its infancy. However, the availability of genome-wide scans with hundreds or thousands of polymorphisms will, in the future, make it possible. However, challenges and pitfalls exist in association studies, and consideration of particular features of study design is necessary before making definite conclusions from these studies.",

    "abstract": "Background: Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is encountered in 8% to 10% of all patients with congenital heart defects. In the past, the confirmed diagnosis of CoA relied on angiography, however, this technique uses hazardous radiation, and carries a risk of causing vascular damage at the puncture site, particularly in infants. This study aimed to discover whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was a useful non-invasive tool to estimate the severity of CoA before or after repair. Methods: Ten children (4 boys and 6 girls), aged from 17 days to 7 years (mean, 1.1 years), 6 who had native CoA and 4 who had re-stenosis after repair, underwent MRI and angiography. The diameters of the aortic arch at the left carotid artery branching (AA), as well as the diameters at the narrowest site on the aorta and descending aorta in the diaphragmatic area (DA), were measured and compared using the above-mentioned 2 methods. Linear correlation coefficients were applied to compare the correlation between MRI and angiography. The relative narrowing of CoA was calculated by using CoA / DA 100% between MRI and angiographic measurement. Narrowing of more than 60% was thought to induce a significant pressure gradient that called for surgical intervention. Results: The mean diameters of AA, CoA and DA were, respectively, 6.3 ±1.8 mm, 3.8 ±2.0 mm and 7.2 ±1.4 mm by MRI measurement, and 6.6 ±2.7 mm, 4.0 ±2.1 mm and 7.2 ±l.8 mm by angiography. The mean differences of measured diameters by the 2 methods were AA1.48 mm (SD = l.32 mm), CoA 0.72 mm (SD = 0.78 mm) and DA 0.90 mm (SD = 0.83 mm). The linear correlation coefficient (r value) for the diameter of different locations along the aorta as measured by MRI and angiography was 0.662 at AA, 0.868 at CoA and 0.706 at DA. Using this criteria, there was a consistent, relative narrowing calculated by both MRI and angiography. Conclusion: The mean difference, when taken together with a good linear correlation coefficient of the diameters as measured by MRI and angiography, make this technique acceptable. In addition, MRI proved to be a reliable predictor of the probable severity of coarctation. As a result, we may conclude that MRI is suitable for evaluating the location, size and severity of the coarctation before and after treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: DNA polymorphisms of component genes in RAS were reported to modulate the process of post-PTCA restenosis. This study was designed to assess the influence of eight gene polymorphisms involved at different steps of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) enzymatic cascade on post-percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) restenosis simultaneously. We think systemic analysis of predisposing alleles in RAS will clarify our understanding of mechanisms derived from the conflicting results of previous studies. Methods: This prospective study included 290 Chinese patients who underwent a successful angioplasty procedure and follow-up angiography (mean 42.4±14.5 months) if angina recurred with positive noninvasive stress tests. Restenosis was defined as a more than 50% diameter stenosis at the previously treated vessel site. Results: Among these gene polymorphisms, only ACE D allele was significantly associated with post-PTCA restenosis in univariate (D/D 72.5%, D/I 54.4%, I/I 47.5%, p value test for trend＜0.01) and multivariate (p value test for trend＜0.01) analysis. One novel finding in our study is that the effect of ACE D allele on restenosis is reversed by AGT-M174 allele (p value to test for the interaction term=0.03). Conclusions: Our results indicate ACE D allele increases the risk of post-PTCA restenosis, and this risk is modified by the coexistence of AGT-M174 allele in Chinese patients. Gene-gene interactions have increasing importance in the post-genome era and may explain contradictory results in previous studies.",

Although this technique is generally reliable, results can be inconclusive in some cases. The purpose of this study was to assess whether candidates for coronary angiogram could be better identified with the addition of an electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated myocardial perfusion scan to a thallium scan. Method: A total of 512 patients with suspected coronary artery disease were included in this study and received a thallium scan. In 69 patients, the results were borderline, and 32 of these 69 patients also received an ECG-gated scan and underwent coronary angiogram within one month. Results: We found that 21 of the 32 patients who underwent coronary angiogram had significant coronary artery disease. However, when an ECG-gated perfusion scan was also performed, 25 of the 32 patients had abnormal regional wall motion following the stress test. Twenty-one of these 25 patients were found to have significant coronary artery disease. Statistical analysis revealed that the ECG-gated perfusion scan in combination with the thallium scan was significantly more accurate than the thallium scan alone in borderline cases of myocardial perfusion scan (p = 0.0166), with 100% sensitivity, 63.6% specificity, an 84% positive predictive rate, and a 100% negative predictive rate. Conclusions: The ECG-gated perfusion scan in combination with a thallium scan was more accurate in predicting the presence of coronary artery disease than a thallium scan alone in borderline cases of myocardial perfusion scan.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The outcome after surgical repair of acute type A aortic dissection has been improving in experienced centers. However, there are limited data about the prognosis in community hospitals.\nMethods: Twenty-three consecutive patients (11 men and 12 women) underwent operations for acute type A aortic dissection between January 2002 and June 2006. Patients' ages ranged from 41 to 86 years (mean age 61.0±12.3 years). Surgical procedures included supracoronary ascending aorta (n=16) or hemiarch graft (n=7) replacement, with aortic valve resuspension for commissural detachment (n=22). Cannulation of the femoral artery as the arterial inflow was carried out in all patients except one as well as deep hypothermic circulatory arrest for open distal aortic anastomosis. Retrograde cardioplegia and cerebral perfusion were routinely used. Selective cerebral antegrade perfusion via right axillary artery was used in the last patient in our series. After distal aortic anastomosis, the arterial cannula was inserted into the prosthesis. Cardiopulmonary bypass then resumed with rewarming followed by aortic annuloplasty and proximal anastomosis.\nResults: The surgical and in-hospital mortality was 8.69%(2 of 23 patients), with no late death during a mean follow-up period of 36.5±17.3 months. Mean circulatory arrest duration was 47.0±12.0 minutes. Complications encountered included respiratory failure in 2 patients undergoing tracheostomy and minor stroke in one of them with improvement later. Postoperative bleeding which required reoperation happened in 7 patients. Biological glue was used in late of our series. One patient received reoperation 3 years later for progressive dilatation of descending aortic aneurysm.\nConclusion: Femoral arterial cannulation and retrograde cerebral perfusion continue to be useful selections for acute type A aortic dissection repair. Conservative surgical strategy avoiding the replacement of the aortic arch may be an alternative option for less experienced surgeons in a community hospital.",

    "abstract": "Familial Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome has an autosomal dominant inheritance. Previous genetic linkage studies showed the locus was on Chromosome 7 (7q3), and the gene was identified to be PRKAG2, which encodes for gamma-2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The PRKAG2 mutation has been related to familial WPW syndrome with concomitant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and/or atrio-ventricular nodal disease. There was no data about PRKAG2 mutation and familial WPW syndrome in Taiwan. Therefore, we report the status of PRKAG2 mutation in a family containing 2 siblings with documented WPW syndrome. Neither cardiac hypertrophy nor atrio-ventricular nodal disease was found in this family. Polymerase chain reactions were performed to amplify the translated region of the PRKAG2 gene. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography was subsequently used to screen for the presence of heterodulplexes, and DNA sequencing was applied to these heterodulplexes. No PRKAG2 mutation was identified in these family members, although four intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified (in introns 2, 5, 9, and 16 respectively). In conclusion, this case report shows the absence of association between PRKAG2 mutation and isolated familial WPW syndrome (without concomitant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and/or atrio-ventricular nodal disease).",

Unfortunately, one of the major problems encountered in long-term hemodialysis is vascular access stenosis, leading to poor dialysis and ultimately resulting in thrombosis. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for failing vascular access significantly prolongs the life of access. However, two major problems have not been solved in conventional high pressure balloon angioplasty. One is a strong tendency of reobstruction within a short time; the other problem is balloon-resistant stenosis, which represents the major cause of technical failure and inevitably requires surgical intervention. Development of new device is necessary to overcome such problems. From April to July 2005, we identified 5 cases with severe undilatable lesions, accounting for about 3% of our treatment patients. Four of them were treated by cutting balloon with excellent angiographic results without complication or difficulty, successfully salvaging the dialysis access. Cutting balloon angioplasty should be an essential adjunct treatment modality for those patients with undilatable lesions.",

We hypothesized that functional alterations of the endothelium-derived NO pathway in the presence of the 894G＞T polymorphism of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) gene may be related to circadian variation of blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension.\nMethods: A total of 101 ambulatory patients (49 men, 52 women) with essential hypertension were recruited in this study. Noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and genotyping by polymerase chain reaction amplification of all subjects were performed. The patients were then classified into four groups according to their dipping status: extreme dippers, dippers, non-dippers, and risers. Chi-square test was used for comparison of the allelic and genotypic frequencies among different groups.\nResults: The frequencies of the genotypic and allelic frequencies in the study population were comparable to previous reports. There was a trend of increase of genotypic and allelic frequencies of the 894G＞T polymorphism in the non-dipper group (non-dippers + risers; n=52) as compared to the dipper group (dippers + extreme dippers; n=49), although the difference was not statistically significant. However, a significant increase in the genotypic (p=0.021) frequency and allelic frequency (p=0.028) of the 894G＞T variant in the risers (n=8), compared to those of the dippers (n=45) was noted. After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking status, the presence of 894G＞T variant remained a significant predictor of risers (odds ratio 7.95; 95% C.I.=1.36-46.4; p=0.021).\nConclusions: In this study, a significant association of the 894G＞T variant with circadian variation of BP in patients with essential hypertension was demonstrated.

    "abstract": "Background: To assess timing and suitability for heart transplantation and to tailor treatment regimens to individual patients, identification of patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF) at higher risk of death and of cardiac events is important. Plasma levels of soluble (s) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are elevated in patients with congestive heart failure and may play an important role in its pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma levels of sCAMs could provide prognostic information in these patients. Methods: We measured plasma levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), sP-selectin, and sTNF- in 41 hospitalized patients (32 male, 9 female, aged 59±17 years) with ESHF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)≤30% and in 18 healthy control subjects. Major adverse cardiac events (death, heart transplantation, or hospitalization with worsening heart failure) during a median follow-up period of 325 days were determined. Results: The concentrations of sCAMs and TNF-α in the 41 patients with ESHF were significantly higher than those in the controls. Significantly higher sVCAM-1 and sTNF-α levels were also noted in those patients who had major adverse cardiac events during the follow-up period. By Cox proportional hazards analysis, high sVCAM-1 level and low LVEF were independent significant predictors of adverse outcome in these patients. In addition, the elevation of sVCAM-1 was correlated with sTNF- (r = 0.439, p = 0.004), but was minimally correlated with LVEF (r = 0.025, p = 0.879). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that measurement of sVCAM-1 may have the potential to play an important role for risk assessment in patients with ESHF.",

The outcomes of stent implantation in patients with procedure-induced LMCA dissection are still unclear.\nMethod: From April 2002 to December 2005, 4852 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary artery disease in this institute. During this period, 5 patients (0.1%) developed procedure-induced LMCA dissection during PCI, and they received stent implantation for this complication.\nResult: All of the 5 patients developed procedure-induced LMCA dissection during PCI for stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Procedure-induced dissection of the LMCA developed during manipulation of the guiding catheter in 1, after balloon dilatation for LAD steno sis in 1, and after stent implantation for LAD stenosis in 3 patients. Immediate success of stent implantation for LMCA dissection was achieved in all 5 patients. No major complication was noted during LM stenting. At a mean follow-up period of 43±23 months (range 9 to 66 months), four of the 5 patients (80%) underwent repeated coronary angiography due to recurrent angina. One of 4 patients received PCI for restenosis of LMCA. There were no major cardiac events, including requirement of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, myocardial infarction or death during the follow-up period.\nConclusion: LMCA dissection during PCI could be successfully managed by prompt stent implantation, with acceptable immediate and long-term outcomes.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between brachial artery spasms after transradial cardiac catheterization and coronary artery disease.\nMethods: Two hundred and forty-one patients who received transradial cardiac catheterization for diagnosis of coronary artery disease were enrolled in this study. Brachial artery angiography was performed after cardiac catheterization in order to document brachial artery spasms. Age, sex, coronary risk factors, clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic characteristics were included in our assessment.\nResults: In 241 patients enrolled, 99 patients had coronary artery disease and the others did not. The rate of brachial artery spasm was 9.09% (9/99) in patients with coronary artery disease and 23.94% (34/142) in patients without coronary artery disease (p=0.001). In univariate analysis, factors associated with brachial artery spasms included heart rate, diameter of brachial artery and coronary artery disease. In multivariate analysis, the absence of coronary artery disease (p=0.019) and the diameter of brachial artery (p=0.005) were the independent predictors of brachial\nartery spasms after transradial cardiac catheterization. The patient with coronary artery disease was less likely to have brachial artery spasms after transradial cardiac catheterization.\nConclusion: Our study suggests that brachial artery spasms do not affect the feasibility of transradial coronary intervention in patients with coronary artery disease.

Clinical manifestation and conventional arteriography are the bases of diagnosis. In early phase, inflammation involves all layers of vessels and periaortic tissue to cause aortic wall thickening. Conventional arteriography may not show these mural changes in the great vessels. In late occlusive phase, both the conventional arteriography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may show luminal changes such as stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, collateral branches and dilatation of aorta or pulmonary artery. MR imaging and MR angiography have been used to replace conventional arteriogram for diagnosis and follow-up after treatment due to their non-invasive nature and absence of radiation exposure. Furthermore, MR imaging can detect abnormality in vessel wall in early phase of the disease. In Taiwan, reports on the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis based on MR imaging and MR angiography are rare.

Then cardiac catheterization gradually became a gold standard in the diagnosis of congenital heart diseases as well as valvular heart diseases. In 1953, Gibbon set a milestone for cardiac surgery by invention of cardiopulmonary bypass. Mason Sones performed the first diagnostic coronary angiogram at Cleveland Clinic in 1958. Rene Favaloro did the first coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 1967. From then on, coronary artery diseases (CAD) have had excellent resolution. 1977 saw Andreas Gruentzig change the landscape by doing the first coronary angioplasty on an awake human. Julio Palmaz and Richard Schatz pushed the advance further by invention of balloon expandable stents to address the issues of recoil and restenosis after balloon angioplasty. Cardiologists have modernized myocardial revascularization by much investment and great innovation. Percutaneous coronary intervention started to play a major role in the myocardial revascularization in the last two decades. The advent of new technologies provides many less invasive methods of myocardial revascularization, such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stents, brachytherapy, intravascular ultrasound, rotablator, and drug-eluting stents.",

    "abstract": "Object: To evaluate the effect of different types and regimens of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) on patients with Kawasaki Disease. Patients: From June 1994 to May 2002, 120patients who met the diagnostic criteria of Kawasaki disease (KD) at our institution were reviewed. Of them, 99 who had complete data were enrolled in this study. Before IVIG therapy, 25(25.3%) of 99 patients had coronary artery involvement. Methods: Patients with KE were given a different brand and dosage of IVIG when available in the hospital in random order. They were divided randomly into 4 groups with different types and regimens of high-dose IVIG.. Group I (33 cases)-G regimen, 400 mg/kg/day×5days; Group II (47 cases)-G regimen, 2gm/kg×1dose; Group III(10cases)- I regimen, 400mg/kg/day×5days; Group IV (9 cases)-I regimen, 2 gm/kg×1dose. Patients’ data were collected including: 1. age and sex; 2. symptoms and signs; 3. fever lasting days after IVIG; 4 echocardiographic findings (before IVIG, at acute stage, at convalescent stage, and long term follow-up); 5. retreatment with IVIG. Results: 1. There were some differences in the clinical features, including sex, age, duration of fever before administration of IVIG, and diagnostic criteria of Kawasaki Disease among the 4 groups; 2 The durations of fever lasting after administration of IVIG were 3.9±2.2,2.8±1.4,4.3±2.5, and 2.0±1.3days in Groups I, II , III and IV, respectively; 3. Two-dimensional echocardiographic evidence of coronary arterial dilatation/aneurysm detected before IVIG in Groups I, II, III and IV were, respectively, 3.4%, 40.4%, 30.0%, and 11.1%, at acute stage were 60.6%, 44.7%, 20%, and 22.2%, at convalescent stage were 12.1%, 17.0%, 0%, and 0%, and at long-term follow-up were 12.1%, 12.8%, 0%, and 0%.4. The rates of retreatment with IVIG were 9.1%, 8.5%, 10%, 11.1%in group I, II III and IV, respectively. Conclusions: 1.Treatment of Kawasaki Disease with the regimen of 2 gm/kg × one dose of IVIG had a better effect to shorten the duration of fever than that with 400 mg/kg/day × 5days. 2. G and I regimens seemed to make a difference in prevention of coronary dilation/aneurysm at acute stage, although the difference was without statistical significance; and there were no statistical differences in convalescent stage, long-term follow-up and retreatment, even for different dosages and brands. 3 If the patients with coronary abnormalities before IVIG were excluded, coronary abnormality prevention rates were 50.0%, 49.2%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, by the four different regimens of IVIG.",

    "abstract": "Background. As a beating organ in the human body, the structure and motion of the heart can be depicted best with real-time 3-dimensional (RT-3D) image modality. Traditional M-mode and real-time two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography can be used for diagnosis of complex congenital heart defects, but with these modalities, the type of lesion and its complexity can only be appreciated indirectly, after composition of plane sections of different angles in mind. This study utilized the newly invented echocardiography platform for RT-3D scanning in selected patients with congenital heart diseases and evaluated its clinical applications in those patients.\nMaterials and Methods. Between February 2003 and April 2003, totally 18 patients of 4 different categories of diagnoses (4 cases with double-outlet right ventricle, 5 cases with tetralogy of Fallot, 4 cases with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular sepum and 5 cases with single ventricle) were enrolled in this study. Scanning in these patients was performed with 2D scanner then the Philips SONOS 7500 system equipped with an Matrix probe. Their ages ranged from 10 days to 12 years, and the body weight ranged from 2.5 to 50 kilograms. Two modes of scanning were used in this study to evaluate the feasibility for diagnosis and analysis of the complex lesions in our patients. Comparison of clinical usefulness was also made with 2D echocardiography. \nResults. The time spent for RT-3D scanning (11.4±1.4 min.) was significantly less than that for 2D platform (12.8±1.9 min.) ( p ＜ 0.01). Visceral situs was confirmed in 17 (94.4%) patients with the RT-3D platform and 16 (88.9%) patients with the 2D platform. Cardiac connections were analyzed segmentally, and 14 (77.8%) vs 13 (72.2%), 17 (94.4%) vs 16 (88.9), and 18 (100%) vs 18 (100%) patients were confirmed in their venoatrial, atrioventricular, and ventriculoarterial connections, respectively. Difference was found in confirmation of tricuspid and mitral valves in 13 (72.2%) and 10 (55.6%) with RT-3D and 2D platforms, respectively. One full-volume data set in each of 4 patient groups was used to analyze the 3D relationship of the complex lesions and their surrounding structures, and was demonstrated in this study. \nConclusion: The capability of the new RT-3D system for fast, accurate diagnosis of complex congenital heart lesions was demonstrated in this study. Meanwhile, with the RT-3D system, the examiner can delineate the complex intracardiac morphology and 3D relationships easily and intuitively. More clinical information can be derived from the new system, including that which is required for planning surgery. Improvement in image resolution and operation procedure has made this RT-3D scanning system ready for practically clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Coronary artery disease is the primary cause of death among patients with end-stage renal disease worldwide. Conventional coronary arterial bypass grafting (CABG) under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is still a high-risk procedure. In the past few years, off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting has afforded an alternative way to improve the surgical result. The authors report their experience of performing conventional CABG and off-pump CABG in regular dialysis patients. Methods: From January 1999 to April 2002, we compared retrospectively 25 consecutive uremia patients undergoing CABG. Group I: 14 patients undergoing conventional CABG, and Group II: 11 patients undergoing off-pump CABG. We analyzed the data between these two procedures including age, gender, pre-operative characteristics, intra-operative blood transfusions, operative time, post-operative inotropic use, post-operative bleeding (drainage amount), extubation time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, total hospital stay, and complications. Results: There were statistically significant differences between the two groups. Off-pump CAB procedures resulted in significantly (p ＜ 0.05) lower mean operative time: 260 (200-235) vs. 307.5 (215-502) min, post-operative potassium value: 4 (3.4-5.2) mmol/L vs. 5.05(3.9-6.2) mmol/L, post-operative dopamine: 2.52 (0-5.4) ug/min/kg vs. 5.35 (2.53-15.2) ug/min/kg and dobutamin 0 ug/min/kg vs. 2.8(0-10) ug/min/kg use, ICU stay: 1 (1-5) days vs. 3 (1-24) days, extubation time: 8 (1-456) hours vs. 25.67 (6-543) hours, post-operative bleeding: 610 (375-1135) mL vs. 1443 (335-3877) mL, time of removal of drainage tube: 3.0 (2-4) days vs. 4.5 (3-9) days, postoperative blood transfusion: 0(0-500) mL vs. 500(0-200) mL. Conclusions: Our preliminary experience demonstrates that short-term outcomes in uremia patents undergoing off-pump CABG are better than conventional CABG. Off-pump CABG supplies a safe and effective method to treat uremia patients with coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Background: Complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) and dominant frequency (DF) mapping have been proposed to be promising targets for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. However, the relationship between CFAEs and DF is unknown. This study investigated the regional distribution, electrogram morphology, and spectral characteristics of complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs).Methods: Sixteen patients with paroxysmal AF (age=45±10, male=12) and 18 with persistent AF (age=51±13, male=16) undergoing AF ablation were included in the study. Frequency domain analysis was performed on the intracardiac electrograms (6.82 seconds, I KHz/channel) recorded from each of pulmonary veins (PVs), left atrium (LA), right atrium, and coronary sinus during AF. The largest peak frequency was identified as the DF.Results: Intracardiac atrial bipolar electrograms during AF were classified into 3 types; CFAE-Ⅰ defined as rapid discrete electrograms: CFAE-Ⅱ defined as continuous fractionated electrograms; and other electrograms were defined as non-CFAE. CFAE-Ⅰ were found mostly in PV, while CFAE-Ⅱwere observed more frequently in LA in both persistent and paroxysmal AF. CFAE-Ⅰ were associated with high DF, whereas non-CFAE were associated with the low DF. CFAE-Ⅰ consistently related with high DF in all areas of interest in both AF groups. However, CFAE-Ⅱ was related with high DF only in PV and LA in persistent AF.Conclusion: The disparities found between persistent and paroxysmal AF in morphology, distribution, and DF value may reflect the different roles of CFAEs in AF maintenance observed between both groups.",

Mounting evidence indicates that oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of albuminuria in diabetes and hypertensive patients.

Urinary albumin concentrations were presented as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Oxidative stress was estimated by measuring urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results: During univariate analysis stratified by gender, urinary ACR was significantly positively correlated with blood pressure and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in men and correlated with blood pressure, total cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, LDL-cholesterol level, body mass index and urinary 8-OHdG in women. In the multivariate analysis adjusted for age and smoking, only HOMA-IR (p=0.017) was an important influential factor of urinary ACR in men. On the contrary, urinary 8-OHdG (p=0.010) was positively associated with urinary ACR in women.Conclusion: Oxidative stress may serve as a risk factor for the presence of albuminuria in Taiwanese women.",

However, there was still a lack of information regarding the underlying genetic factors in Taiwanese PAH patients.Methods: A total of 6 patients diagnosed with IPAH were enrolled in this study. The entire protein-coding region and intron/exon boundaries of the BMPR2 and ALK1 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by direct sequencing.Results: We identified 3 patients with BMPR2 heterozygous exonic mutations. One was a missense mutation. R491W. The second was a 2-base pair (bp) TG deletion at position s 1446 and 1447 relative to the translation start site. The third was a 2-bp CA deletion replaced by a single nucleotide T insertion at positions 991 and 992. The latter two mutations arc novel and expected to result in frame shifts and premature termination. None of these 6 patients carried exonic mutation s in the ALK1 gene.Conclusion: A substantial portion of Taiwanese IPAH patients carry BMPR2mutations. Since mutations in BMPR 2 may be heritable and are associated with poor prognosis, genetic screening for BMPR 2 mutation s may be necessary for Taiwanese IPAH patients.",

The longitudinal early diastolic strain rate (SRe) was significantly reduced in FD compared with the controls (1.5±0.3 vs. 2.0±0.1 s^(-1), P=0.001), despite no difference in tissue velocity and other strain measurement s. Longitudinal SRe was lower in male patients than female carriers (1.3±0.3 vs. 1.7±0.2 s^(-1), P=0.006). In female carriers, longitudinal SRe was lower compa red with the controls (1.7 ±0.2 vs. 2.0 ±0.1 S^(-1), P = 0.004). Furth ermore, longitudinal SRc was significantly lower in FD without LVH compared with the control group (1.6±0.3 vs. 2.0±0.1 s^(-1), P=0.002).Conclusion: Early diastolic strain rate is reduced in non-hypertrophied female carriers and pre-hypertrophy male Fabry patients. These data indicates that SRe is a sensitive and early marker of Fabry cardiomyopathy, and suggests a potential role for strain echocardiography in evaluation and management of patients with FD.",

However, CAF complicated with a huge aneurysm does not frequently occur. Determining the optimal management of symptomatic patients with CAF and aneurysm still remains a challenging problem, and has been traditionally considered as an indication for cardiac surgery. The use of transcatheter coil embolization for CAF has emerged as a less invasive strategy, and has recently been considered as an alternative to surgical correction. We reported a 71-year-old male patient with a congenital CAF, originating from the left circumflex artery and draining into the right ventricle, complicated with a giant aneurysm presenting with typical angina pectoris and exertional dyspnea. This patient underwent successful transcatheter closure of both the fistula and aneurysm using a coil embolization technique, and had an uneventful recovery after treatment.",

Patient baseline characteristics and long-term outcomes were recorded and analyzed, and the primary patency rate was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.Results: The 41 patients in our study consisted of 19 males and 22 females with a mean age of 62.8 ± 12.1 years. There were 21 cases of right-sided CVS and 20 cases of left-sided CVS. Of the procedures performed, 12 were arteriovenous grafts and 29 were native arteriovenous fistulas. Initial fistulography revealed 14 occluded lesions (34.1%) and 27 stenotic lesions (65.9%). During intervention, thrombosis was found in 8 cases (19.5%) and CVS was combined with other lesions in 21 cases (51.2%). The TR approach achieved a technique success rate of 90.2%. The median primary patency time was 8.4 months, and the primary patency rates at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 81%, 64%, 57%, and 45%, respectively. There were no adverse events caused by radial artery occlusion.Conclusion: TR intervention is a feasible alternative to conventional intervention in selected CVS cases, particularly those combined with lesions located at arterio-venous or arterio-graft anastomotic areas(within 2 cm to anastomosis).",

Method: We prospectively enrolled men with effort angina and ischemic treadmill exercise test or thallium-201 myocardial scan from outpatient department for coronary angiography (CAG) from 2007 to 2009. Patients with advanced valvular heart disease and poor ejection fraction by echocardiography were excluded. According to the result of CAG, they were divided into two groups: those receiving PCI (PCI group) and those without obvious stenosis syndrome X patients (syndrome X group). CPX was carried out before and after CAG with an interval of 4 weeks. A series of physiological parameters were obtained, including age, BMI, lipid profiles, biochemical tests, heart rate, blood pressure, VO2max, VE/VCO2, anaerobic threshold, exercise duration, cardiac output (CO), cardiac power output (CPO), and cardiac reserve. Results: Totally, 20 men, mean age 51.9 year-old, were enrolled in the study. There were significantly lower levels in cardiac reserve and peak exercise CPO before CAG in the PCI patients, but no significant differences between age, BMI, biochemical tests or other parameters obtained from CPX before and after CAG between groups. Conclusion: By CPX, only peak exercise CPO and cardiac reserve before PCI are significantly lower in men with stable CAD, as compared to those with syndrome X. Whether PCI is able to improve CPX remains unclear after this pilot study.",

We report our treatment results with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe ARDS patients.\nPatients and Methods: From December 2001 through July 2005, there were 10 patients receiving treatment of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for ARDS and/or septic shock in our hospital. There were six male and four female patients. The median age at the time of ECMO support was 4.3 years old (range: 2.1-71). Venoarterial-ECMO was used for the patients with severe desaturation and persistent hypotension, and venovenous-ECMO was used for the patients with severe desaturation but preserved cardiac function.\nResults: Five patients (50%) survived the ECMO. The ECMO survival rate was 20% (1/5) between 2001 and 2002, and was 80% (4/5) between 2003 and 2005. The median ECMO supporting time was 89 hours. The cause of mortality was hypoxic encephalopathy in 2 patients, intra-cranial hemorrhage in 1 patient, deteriorated pulmonary function in 1 patient and uncontrolled sepsis in 1 patient. All the survived patients were discharged from the hospital.\nConclusion: ECMO can rescue more patients with severe ARDS, even in the condition of septic shock. Improved results were reported in the literature, and our series also shows similar trend. For those patients with severe ARDS whose conditions cannot be improved or even deteriorate under conventional therapy, ECMO can provide a chance of survival.",

Methods: This study reviewed the outcomes of 89 consecutive patients who underwent PCI for distal ULMCA stenoses. Restenosis rate, target-lesion revascularization (TLR), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were analyzed. Results: Group Ⅲ displayed the highest overall restenosis rate (75.0%), primarily involving the ostium of the left circumflex artery, while restenosis was observed at the ULMCA per se in 2.6% of patients in Group Ⅰ. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine＞1.4mg/dl) was an independent risk factor predicting overall restenosis (OR: 7.704; p=0.047), and implantation of DES associated with lower restenosis rate (OR: 0.189; p=0.002). Cumulative TLR rate at two years was significantly lower in Group Ⅰ than Group Ⅲ (19.3% vs. 49.5%; p=0.011), but Groups Ⅰ and Ⅱ(25.4%) did not differ significantly. Conclusion: This investigation demonstrated that the debulking strategy with selective DCA from left anterior descending artery to ULMCA before BMS implantation did not achieve better clinical outcomes titan a non-debulking strategy with implantation of either BMS or DES. Implantation of DES resulted in significant reduction of restenosis at ULMCA per se. DES had numerically lower TLR anti MACE than those of BMS, which was statistically insignificant due to the small case number.",

However, pseudocoarctation of the aorta does not have pressure gradient cross the stenotic area, so blood pressure is the same over four extremities. We describe a case of pseudocoarctation of the aorta, which presented unusually as a giant aortic arch aneurysm with asymmetric brachial blood pressure in a 52-year-old male. He was hypertensive and had a history of relatively lower blood pressure in his left arm. A diagnosis of pseudocoarctation of the aorta with giant aortic arch aneurysm was made according to the results of chest X-rays, computed tomography, cardiac echocardiography and catheterization. Under cardiopulmonary bypass, the giant aortic arch aneurysm were resected and replaced with an 18-mm woven graft. Based on a MEDLINE search up to 2007, we believe that this is the first reported case of pseudocoarctation of the aorta presenting with asymmetric brachial blood pressure. Physicians should keep in mind that measurement of blood pressure in the four extremities is necessary in all cases of suspected aortic arch disease with hypertension.",

However, the sequential changes of these parameters in the infarct area and remote zones, which may have tethering effect, after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have not been demonstrated.\nMethods: Sixteen patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction who underwent successful PCI were included in this study. We performed echocardiography soon, 24 hours and 72 hours after primary PCI, to measure the peak systolic strain rate (S(subscript SR)), postsystolic shortening (PSS), peak strain rate in early diastole (E(subscript SR)), late diastole (A(subscript SR)) and peak systolic strain (e) to characterize the myocardial contraction. Follow-up echocardiography or thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging were performed 6 months later to identify patients who showed persistent akinesia or fixed perfusion defect as group 1. Those patients who had imaging examinations implicating viable myocardium were classified as group 2.\nResults: Soon after primary PCI, 5SR was significantly lower in the infarct zones than in remote zones (P＜0.05), with concurrent development of PSS (P＜0.05). Furthermore, the reduction of SSR and development of PSS were observed in group 1, not in group 2. However, the PSS of infarct zones in group 1 recovered after 72 hours (P＜0.05 versus 24 hours after PCI) and reached no significant difference in comparison with that of remote zones when the SSR of the infarct zones remained significantly lower (P＜0.05).\nConclusion: The infarct zones can be precisely detected using strain and strain rate imaging. The more myocardium that has vanished, the more the systolic strain rate changes in the infarct zones. Remodeling process after AMI proceeds and can be observed with strain rate imaging, especially in infarct zones with prominent scar formation. However, the sequential PSS recovery could not serve as a surrogate marker of myocardial viability.",

Methods: Thirty-five patients (40 lesions) with repeat in-stent restenosis were recruited between May 2004 and June 2005. All patients received ELCA+CBA. Coronary angiogram was followed 6 months later. Five patients had received graft stents for previous coronary perforation. Four patients were excluded due to missing angiograms. Results: Left anterior descending artery, left circumflex, and right coronary artery lesions were 22, 8, and 6 in number, respectively. The stent length, stent diameter, and lesion length were 20.03±4.99 mm, 3.17±0.34 mm, and 14.13±8.00 mm, respectively. The minimal lumen diameter increased from 0.79±049 mm before treatment to 1.95±0.52 mm after eccentric ELCA, and 2.65±0.31 mm after CBA, but had declined to 1.25±1.05 at 6 months. The diameter stenosis decreased from 74±16% before intervention to 32±14% after laser surgery, and 16±18% after CBA, but later increased to 60±32%. The overall restenosis rate was 56%. The recurrent restenosis rates in ISR with lesion length＜9 mm and in ISR with lesion length≧9 mm were 23% and 74%, respectively. Excluding graft stent lesions, the overall restenosis rates, was 42%.

Evidence of the relationship of CRP levels to the presence of CAD and subclinical atherosclerotic plaques in stable angina patients were less consistent. Methods: This study included 112 consecutive patients who received coronary angiography for stable angina. Based on coronary angiogram, patients were divided into two groups: with and without significant CAD. Patients Based significant CAD were further subdivided into those with subclinical atherosclerotic plaques and those with normal coronary arteries. The Gensini scaring system was used so describe the extent of CAD. Blood samples for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) measurement were taken for comparison. Results: Sixty-five (58%) patients had significant CAD. Of forty-seven (42%) patients without significant CAD, thirty-six (32%) had insignificant atherosclerotic plaques, and eleven (10%) had normal coronary arteries. The hsCRP levels in CAD patients were higher than those in patients without CAD (p=0.049), but the difference was abolished when excluding patients wish normal coronary arteries. The hsCRP levels in CAD patients wish plaques were higher than in patients with normal coronary arteries (p=0.015). No correlation between hsCRP levels and extent of CAD was noted. In the CAD group hsCRP levels were significantly higher in patients with hyperlipidemia (p=0.011) and lower in patients with statin treatment (p=0.036). However, hyperlipidemia or statin treatment did not influence hsCRP levels in patients without CAD. After adjustment using multivariate regression, hyperlipidemia (p=0.006) and statin (p=0.048) were still independent predictors of hsCRP levels. Conclusion: CRP levels are equivalent between patients with stable CAD and subclinical atherosclerotic plaques. Hyperlipidemia and statin treatment influence CRP levels in patients with CAD but nor in patients without CAD.",

On the other hand, the surgical risk of aortic valve replacement (AVR) also increases for patients with AS and severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk and benefit of AVR for such patients. Methods: From May 1999 to April 2003, 8 consecutive patients with AS and severe LV dysfunction (ejection fraction [HF]≤30%) underwent aortic valve replacement in National Taiwan University Hospital. The myocardial protection was initially achieved with antegrade perfusion and maintained with continuous retrograde cold blood or crystalloid cardioplegia. The indication for aortic valve replacement was severe AS, which was defined as an aortic valve area of≤1.0 cm^2 or a maximum pressure gradient of≥50 mmHg assessed by Doppler echocardiography. The mean age was 67±9 years; and 7 of 8 patients suffered from severe exertional dyspnea (functional class Ⅲ-Ⅳ of New York Heart Association). Respiratory failure developed in 5 patients prior to surgery. Results: The perioperative (30-day) mortality was 0%. During a mean follow-up period of 32±18 months (range 16-61 months), the survival rate was 75%. The clinical symptoms of heart failure improved at least one functional class in all patients. The mean change of LVEF was an increase of 26±18 EF units (p=0.005), and the mean reductions of LV end-systolic dimension and LV end-diastolic dimension were 16±8 (p=0.001) and 11±8mm (p=0.005), respectively. Conclusions: The surgical risk was acceptable for AVR in patients with AS and severe LV dysfunction. Improvements in symptoms, heart size and LV systolic function were observed in most patients.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the majority of cardiac catheter-related deaths occur in patients with: (1) poor condition prior to catheterization, (2) over 50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery (LMCA), and (3) severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. LMCA dissection is a rare but catastrophic complication during a catheter-based procedure. It is usually caused by injury related to manipulation of the catheter and coronary intervention for treating lesions in the LM or other vessels. Previous investigations reported an incidence of procedure-induced LMCA dissection of < 0.1%. Rarely, procedure-induced LMCA dissection will be associated with aortic root dissection. Iatrogenic dissection of the LMCA may compromise the blood supply leading to a large ischemic and lethal myocardial necrosis, and has been identified as a significant risk factor for increased peri-procedural mortality. Reported risk factors for acute procedure-induced LMCA dissection include the presence of atherosclerotic obstructive disease in the LMCA and an unusual location or anatomy of the LMCA that necessitates excessive manipulation of the catheter to achieve entry or results in the catheter tip against the vessel wall. The typical clinical presentations that suggest LMCA dissection include the development of immediate chest pain, which is frequently associated with ischemic electrocardiographic changes, hypotension, and dysrhythmia. The onset of significant ischemia is determined by the rapidity of an expanding hematoma formation, which can critically compromise coronary blood flow. Therefore, the patient may present the symptoms immediately in the catheter laboratory or later in the recovery area/ ward. The angiographic documentation of dissection is also important to earlier identify this complication. The best means of minimizing the possibility of LMCA dissection is through careful evaluation and technique of procedure. Before cardiac catheterization, the identification of higher-risk patients is important. Some evidence demonstrates that the prevalence of LMCA is higher among the older age groups, in middle-aged women presenting with typical anginal symptoms, in the East Asian population, and in patients presenting with severe anginal symptoms who have low tolerance of exercise. Sometimes, the left ventriculogram can provide information on LMCA stenosis before a diagnostic catheter is engaged into LMCA. Currently, 64-slice computed tomography also offers a good screening tool for detecting LMCA stenosis before cardiac catheterization. Additionally, during the procedure, careful selection of a catheter that positions in the same three-dimensional plane as the LMCA is suggested. Use of a superior shaped and soft-as-possible guide wire and catheter is also advised. Furthermore, the guiding catheter, guide wire and balloon catheter should be advanced gently, because the guide wire and balloon catheter may cause trauma to the LMCA while exiting the guiding catheter. The management of LMCA dissection is to restore LM coronary flow before hemodynamic deterioration occurs. Treatment options for this complication include intracoronary stenting and emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). CABG could be a choice of therapy for patients whose clinical and hemodynamic conditions are stable, and where a surgical team is available immediately. However, patients who develop rapid deterioration of hemodynamics often fail to survive even if CABG can be completed. Intracoronary stent implantation has the effect of repairing dissection and achieving rapid restoration of blood flow and hemodynamic stabilization, and can be a life-saving procedure in these circumstances. As we know, intracoronary stenting has been",

    "abstract": "Background: Neurocardiogenic syncope is well known as the most frequent cause of syncope in childhood. The head-up tilt table test (HUTT) is now widely used to evaluate patients with unexplained syncope. Although many reports have reported on children associated with neurocardiogenic syncope, the relationship between the clinical characteristics of those patients and the results of the HUTT remains to be clarified. We therefore studied the children with unexplained syncope who underwent a tilt table test at our institution, to determine their clinical characteristics and the HUTT results. Methods: From July 2001 to March 2006, a total of 17 pediatric patients with unexplained presyncope and syncope that underwent a HUTT at our institution were included. We divided those patients into two groups: Group 1 included five children who had a positive tilt table test, and Group 2 included 12 children who had a negative tilt table test. We compared the demographic, clinical and laboratory data between the two groups. Results: There were no significant differences regarding the age, sex, syncopal episodes or duration of the syncopal history between the two groups. The children with a positive HUTT response often had predisposing factors of syncope and experienced prodromes (5/5 vs. 3/12, p＜0.05). A mixed hemodynamic response predominated (80%) in our positive tilt patients. Conclusion: We concluded that the presence of predisposing factors or prodromes of syncope was closely associated with a positive HUTT.",

There were no significant peritoneal signs. Abdominal CT revealed an aneurysm containing a thrombus in the proximal superior mesenteric artery. At surgery, there was no intestinal perforation or gangrene. The aneurysm was replaced with a synthetic prosthesis. Pathology examination showed inflammation compatible with a mycotic aneurysm, although cultures of the resected aneurysm had no growth. We think the patient's pain was most likely caused by bowel ischemia secondary to acute thrombosis of the superior mesentery artery mycotic aneurysm.",

Among electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms, the effect of volatile anesthetics on U wave has never been studied. The aim of the present observational study was to evaluate the possible effect of desflurane on U wave in anesthetized patients.\nMethods: Pen-operative ECG tracings (lead Ⅱ) were recorded and analyzed from 24 gynecologic patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), class 1). Anesthesia was routinely induced with thiopental, fentanyl and succinylcholine and maintained with desflurane (1 to 1.5 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC)) and O2. U wave amplitude (U(subscript amp) was manually measured from amplified ECG records.\nResults: Discernible U wave in 24 patients varied in amplitude (64±24μV). U wave was three times larger when heart rate increased to maximum during tracheal intubation. Similarly, U(subscript amp) was augmented (285%±58% of the control) in extrasystolic beats elicited by tracheal intubation. Desflurane (1 to 1.5 MAC) significantly and reversibly suppressed U(subscript amp)(a decrease by 60±24μV, n=24, p＜0.05).\nConclusions: The suppressive effect of desflurane on U(subscript amp) might be explained by its inhibitory effects on transmembrane ionic currents, intracellular calcium load and delayed afterdepolarizations. Our results support a contributory role of afterpotentials in the genesis of U wave.",

The use of bilateral internal mammary arteries (IMA) as well as right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA) provides the possibility of complete arterial revascularization in multi-vessel coronary artery disease. We reported the short-term outcome of complete myocardial revascularization with only pedicle arterial grafts. Methods: Between February 1999 and January 2003, 171 patients were planned to receive complete myocardial revascularization with only pedicle arterial grafts. Additional vein grafts were required in 22 patients and the other 149 patients were operated on using the technique. All procedures were performed by using internal mammary and right gastroepiploic arteries. We reviewed perioperative and postoperative data of these patients. Results: A total of 399 arterial grafts were harvested and 434 distal anastomoses were created, an average of 2.9 (range, 1-5) per patient. LIMA was used in all 149 patients, RIMA was used in 131 patients (87.9%), and RGEA was used in 119 patients (79.9%). Thirty-five arterial grafts were used for sequential grafting. Six patients (4.1%) had reoperations for mediastinal bleeding. Two patients (1.4%) experienced perioperative myocardial infarction. Sternal wound infection occurred in 7 patients (4.8%). Three patients (2.1%) died in the hospital within 30 days of operation. Conclusion: Our experience shows that complete arterial revascularization can be safely performed.

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The etiology of arrhythmias are complex, and the molecular mechanisms for these disorders have remained largely unknown. 1 In the past decade, a series of studies on the familial forms of long QT syndrome have identified mutations in various ion channel genes as the primary causes of the inheritable forms of ventricular arrhythmias and unraveled a novel molecular pathway for cardiac arrhythmia. 2 However, there is an incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype, and extensive phenotypic variability can be seen among family members carrying the identical mutations in the channel genes. Within the same kindred, certain members who carry the mutation may die of sudden cardiac death, while others carrying the same primary genetic mutation may never develop any arrhythmias during their lifetime. Thus, a defect in the ion channels alone may be necessary, but not sufficient, to induce arrhythmias, indicating the existence of other modifiers. It is believed that a defect in the ion channel genes may provide the substrate or increase the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias, whereas the presence of other genetic modifiers and/or environmental risk factors for arrhythmias then trigger the disease phenotype. 3 Although the identification of the disease-causing genes for monogenic familiar arrhythmia syndromes in human has provided us with a number of new genes and pathway involved in cardiac arrhythmogenesis, it is still not known whether mutations of the same gene can be responsible for the non-heritable form of cardiac arrhythmia or not.

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease is a common but under-recognized problem. As the disease progresses, the patient might suffer from rest pain and/or ischemic ulceration-critical limb ischemia (CLI). The primary goals for treating the limb symptoms of CLI are to improve functional capacity, exercise performance and qualify of life. Although numerous therapy options can be used for CLI, unfortunately, about 20-30% of patients with CLI cannot be treated successfully and the only option for them is often amputation. For this group of patients, there is a great need for alternative treatment strategies, and several strategies to stimulate new vessel formation are currently being tested. These include gene therapy, angiogenic cytokine therapy, and cell therapy (such as with bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells and endothelial progenitor cells). In preclinical studies, most of these therapies have promoted the development of collateral arteries and demonstrated beneficial effects in patients with CLI. However, a great deal of more clinical experience is needed to resolve safety concerns such as potentiation of pathological angiogenesis (e.g., malignancy) and so-called bystander effects of delivered factors (e.g., effects on kidney or atheroma). These concerns limit their clinical applications at the present time. Currently, extensive clinical trials on angiogenesis are underway in Japan and worldwide. However, most of the studies are neither placebo-controlled nor randomized. The focus of future research on collateral artery growth should shift back from exaggerated enthusiasm to clear, hypothesis-driven studies, hopefully providing better insights into the exact molecular mechanisms of postnatal vessel growth. Despite these hurdles on the way to clinical application, the stimulation of collateral artery growth undoubtedly remains one of the most exciting challenges facing the medical scientific community. Given the large number of patients that will benefit from such therapy, accomplishing this task would be a revolutionary step in cardiovascular medicine.",

Methods: Fifty patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomized to receive either P/I or losartan once daily for a period of 12 weeks after a 2-week run-in phase. After 8 weeks treatment, if the office blood pressure (BP) was 140/9 mmHg or greater, the dose was doubled. Response and normalization rates (systolic blood pressure [SBP] less than 140mmHg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] less than 90mmHg), extent of BP reduction, and proportion of patients necessitating increase of dose were compared both in full set and per protocol set analyses. Results: The baseline characteristics were comparable between the two patient groups. Normalization rate was significantly higher in the P/I group than in the losartan group (69.2% vs 41.7%) (p＜0.05); so was the response rate (80.8% vs 54.2%) (p＜0.05). Mean sitting SBP and sitting DBP fell by 15.2±10.0 and 9.5±4.7mmHg, respectively, in the P/I group (p＜0.001)and by 11.6±12.3 and 6.7±7.4mmHg, respectively, in the losartan group (p＜0.001). The falls were greater with P/I than those with losartan; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Both treatments were well tolerated, and laboratory examinations did not show any significant difference between two groups. Conclusions: A low-dose combination of P/I is more effective than losartan in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension, with similar safety profiles. The results suggest that low-dose combination of P/I can be considered as an alternative for the first-line antihypertensive treatment.",

We report two infant patients with congenital heart disease and apical muscular VSDs communicating between the left ventricular apex and the RV infundibular apex.

Patient B was a 18-day old male who had coaractation of the aorta (CoA), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and multiple VSDs (subarterial doubly committed type VSD with apical muscular type VSDs). Their apical VSDs were closed with separate patches via apical right ventriculotomy. The associated cardiac defects were all corrected during the single operation. Good biventricular contractility without residual VSD were confirmed by 14-month follow-up.

    "abstract": "Currently, the transradial approach to cardiac catheterization and coronary interventions has progressively gained popularity as a method of access since its first introduction by Campeau in 1989 for diagnostic coronary angiography. More recently, transradial coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting using 6-Fr guiding catheters have been performed with high success rates and a low risk of vascular complication, initially by Kiemeneij and Laarman. Although, the radial access site of catheterization is not new (the approach dates back to the 1940s), it has only in the last few years become more widespread, not only in Europe but in America and Asia. Technological advances coalesced in the late 1980s, allowing a new generation of cardiologists to reevaluate the radial approach. However, why bother to replace the femoral artery approach? The femoral approach is the dominant technique and easy to learn, offering a high rate of success in obtaining coronary angiograms and performing interventions. The problems with the femoral artery approach include vascular complications and patient discomfort after the procedure initially because of the prolonged period of groin compression and later because of immobilization. The primary barrier to acceptance of the radial technique by interventional cardiologists has been the earning curve. Moreover, in the methods section of some trials, which reported the number of previous procedures performed via the radial artery, it is evident that trials conducted by experienced operators (e.g. more than 1,000 procedures) showed much lower failure rates than trials in which operators had only limited previous experience in transradial coronary angiography or intervention. (procedure failure in radial vs. femoral approach: odds ratio 22.51, 95% CI 3.01 to 168.42 in ACCESS trial with 7% 21/300 patients vs. OR 1.52, 95% CI 0.06 to 37.70 in CARAFE study with 0.7% 1/140 patients). Transradial approach exhibited a higher number of procedural failures in the early and pioneering trials of the 1990s, such failures were far less common in later studies. Actually, there are several reasons underlying a procedural failure. First, inability to successfully puncture the radial artery. Second, failure to reach the coronary ostia. Third, an inadequate catheter support. In this issue of the journal, Huang et al. prospectively study analyzed 346 patients who underwent coronary angiography or angioplasty, of whom 17 (4.9%) patients had procedural failure (10 patients puncture failure and 7 patients fail to reach coronary), 10 (3%) patients had entry site complications. Indeed, one of the major pitfalls of transradial access is radial artery occlusion due to thrombosis. Its incidence ranged from 3% to 6% in the studies that performed a Doppler ultrasound examination of radial artery after the procedure, whereas a loss of radial pulse was present in 0% to 9% of patients in the other trials. No clinical squeals were signaled after occlusion of the radial artery in these patients. In contrast, Huang et al. study had significantly inferior than the other trials (Hung’s: 3% vs. the other trials: 0.3%). Indeed, transradial catheterization has undergone rapid changes during the last decade as technological advances have allowed procedures to be done that before could only be accomplished through larger equipment placed in the femoral artery. Although the transradial technique is rapidly being refined, there are some common elements to the technique that are applicable to most approaches through the radial artery, However, for the transradial approach, a very interesting trend has occurred because of an evident improvement of all the materials (new hydrophilic sheaths, different kinds of pharmacologic cocktails, novel guiding catheters) to reduce the incidence of radial artery spasm and to simplify the engagement of coronary artery. Another issue is regarding the utilization of devices requiring catheters with a larger inner diameter (7-Fr to 8-Fr or more). Further improvements associated with increased operators",

    "abstract": "Thrombosis has been reported to occur variably from 1 day to more than 10 years after Fontan-type operation. We herein describe a case with heterotaxy syndrome with situs ambiguous, dextrocardia, single ventricle, complete atrioventricular canal defect, malposition of great arteries and bilateral superior vena cava who had received pulmonary artery banding and total cavopulmonary connection at the ages of 2 months and 4 years, respectively. However, he was lost to follow-up. Eleven years after the operation, the patient suffered from acute cerebral infarction of right middle cerebral artery territory, which was documented by brain computed tomography. Multiple venous thrombi were detected by suprasternal approach of two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac angiography during hospitalization. The patient finally expired in spite of aggressive treatment.We suggest that transthoracic and/or even transesophageal echocardiography should be performed as a routine surveillance for cardiac function evaluation as well as for thrombus detection in patients after cavopulmonary connection. In addition, long-term use of oral anticoagulant may be necessary, especially when patients have low cardiac output and/or high atrial pressure.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery fistulas are uncommon abnormalities. Large coronary artery fistulas may result in symptomatic heart failure and require treatment. Coil embolization is an acceptable alternative to surgery for patients with coronary fistula. Its complications include coil migration, hematoma, perforation of the vessel wall by the guidewires, and hemolysis. However, complete atrioventricular (AV) block induced by the procedure was not reported previously. We report a 56 year-old man, who suffered from severe dyspnea. Initially, acute coronary syndrome was suspected. A fistula originating from the left circumflex artery and drain into the coronary sinus was noted during cardiac catheterization. For the fistula, this patient underwent transcatheter embolization with coils. Complete AV block occurred just after embolization and temporary pacing was required. We proposed that coil embolization for coronary artery might influence the flow of normal branches near the fistula. If the AV nodal artery flow is compromised, heart block may develop. To deploy the coils more distally could decrease such complication.",

However, PTCA of vessels other than infarct-related artery (IRA) is still considered be contraindicated in the setting of AMI. This study was to assess the feasibility of double-vessel primary angioplasty in acute inferior MI with critical lesions involving both the right coronary artery (RCA) and the left circumflex (LCX) artery. Methods and Results: We herein describe three patients with acute inferior MI in whom two major coronary arteries (RCA and LCX) were high-grade stenotic simultaneously. These three patients all refused to undergo emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Because we could not identify whether the RCA the LCX was the IRA, we successfully performed primary PTCA on these two coronary arteries with two patients supported by intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Conclusions: In acute inferior MI with non-occlusive high-grade stenotic lesions involving both the RCA and the LCX, double-vessel PTCA especially with stenting may provide an alternative to emergency CABG, and may be useful in selected patients who are poor surgical candidates due to co-morbidity or who refuse to undergo CABG. However, further large-scale randomized studies are needed to confirm these observations.",

    "abstract": "Background: Small-sized mechanical aortic prostheses are proposed to be associated with high trans-prosthetic gradients and consequent patient-prosthesis mismatch. This study aimed to assess the hemodynamic performance of patients with St. Jude aortic mechanical prostheses of various sizes. Methods: Dobutamine infusion was performed in 39 patients with three different sizes of St. Jude Medical aortic prostheses. A graded infusion of dobutamine was administered at increments of 5, 10, and 20 µg/kg/min at 15-minute intervals. Pulse-wave and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiograms were performed at rest and stress. Hemodynamic parameters were measured and calculated. Results: In response to dobutamine infusion, mean blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output were increased by 14%, 50%, and 52%, respectively, at maximum stress. Dobutamine stress produced a similar increase in cardiac output in patients with 21-, 23-, and 25-mm, aortic prostheses. Peak trans-prosthetic pressure gradient of 21-, 23-, and 25-mm prostheses increased from 32.7±12.3, 23.8±5.9, and 20.6±5.8mm Hg, respectively, at rest to 75.3±20.3, 57.2±23.1, and 51.2±20.8 mm Hg, respectively, at maximum stress. Using one-way ANOVA, significantly higher peak trans-prosthectic pressure gradient was shown in 21-mm aortic prostheses at rest and maximum stress (p = 0.004, and 0.03 respectively). Effective orifice area index, discharge coefficient, and performance index were comparable in the three valve sizes at rest and maximum stress (all p values ＞ 0.05). Conclusions: St. Jude Medical 21-mm prosheses carriers had higher peak trans-prosthetic pressure gradients at rest and stress but had comparable effective orifice area and effective orifice area index.",

Multivariate analysis showed independent variables associated with CAA rather than CAE, including hyperlipidemia, smoking, and family history of CAD.5 Within aneurysmal segments, abnormal laminar flow and platelet-endothelial-derived pathophysiologic factors lead to thrombus formation.6 Clinical symptoms range from asymptomatic, effort angina to acute coronary syndrome.4\r\n\r\nThe majority of published studies assessed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes in patients with CAE was under clinical setting of acute myocardial infarction, whereas discussions of asymptomatic patients or elective intervention were only limited small case series.7 The treatment modality of elective intervention (covered stent exclusion, stent-assisted coil embolization, or surgical exclusion) differs according to the shape and extent of the lesion.4 Intracoronary manipulation of CAE has complications of distal embolization, no-reflow phenomenon, stent malapposition, dissection and rupture. Furthermore, iatrogenic CAE was also induced after stenting.4",
