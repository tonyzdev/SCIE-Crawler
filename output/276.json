    "abstract": "In this paper, mechanical and short-term durability properties of fly ash and slag based geopolymer concretes (FAGPC-SGPC) were investigated. The alkaline solution was prepared with a mixture of sodium silicate solution (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) for geopolymer concretes. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete was also produced for comparison. Main objective of the study was to examine the usability of geopolymer concretes instead of the ordinary Portland cement concrete for structural use. In addition to this, this study was aimed to make a contribution to standardization process of the geopolymer concretes in the construction industry. For this purpose; SGPC, FAGPC and OPC specimens were exposed to sulfuric acid (H2SO4), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and sea water (NaCl) solutions with concentrations of 5%, 5% and 3.5%, respectively. Visual inspection and weight change of the specimens were evaluated in terms of durability aspects. For the mechanical aspects; compression, splitting tensile and flexural strength tests were conducted before and after the chemical attacks to investigate the\r\nresidual mechanical strengths of geopolymer concretes under chemical attacks. Results indicated that SGPC (100% slag) is stronger and durable than the FAGPC due to more stable and strong cross-linked aluminasilicate polymer structure. In addition, FAGPC specimens (100% fly ash) showed better durability resistance than the OPC specimens. However, FAGPC specimens (100% fly ash) demonstrated lower mechanical performance as compared to OPC specimens due to low reactivity of fly ash particles, low amount of calcium and more porous structure. Among the chemical environments, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) was most dangerous environment for all concrete types.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents chloride induced corrosion durability of reinforcing steel in geopolymer concretes containing different contents of sodium silicate (<TEX>$Na_2SiO_3$</TEX>) and molarities of NaOH solutions. Seven series of mixes are considered in this study. The first series is ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete and is considered as the control mix. The rest six series are geopolymer concretes containing 14 and 16 molar NaOH and <TEX>$Na_2SiO_3$</TEX> to NaOH ratios of 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5. In each series three lollypop specimens of 100 mm in diameter and 200 mm in length, each having one 12 mm diameter steel bar are considered for chloride induced corrosion study. The specimens are subjected to cyclic wetting and drying regime for two months. In wet cycle the specimens are immersed in water containing 3.5% (by wt.) NaCl salt for 4 days, while in dry cycle the specimens are placed in open air for three days. The corrosion activity is monitored by measuring the copper/copper sulphate (<TEX>$Cu/CuSO_4$</TEX>) half-cell potential according to ASTM C-876. The chloride penetration depth and sorptivity of all seven concretes are also measured. Results show that the geopolymer concretes exhibited better corrosion resistance than OPC concrete. The higher the amount of <TEX>$Na_2SiO_3$</TEX> and higher the concentration of NaOH solutions the better the corrosion resistance of geopolymer concrete is. Similar behaviour is also observed in sorptivity and chloride penetration depth measurements. Generally, the geopolymer concretes exhibited lower sorptivity and chloride penetration depth than that of OPC concrete. Correlation between the sorptivity and the chloride penetration of geopolymer concretes is established. Correlations are also established between 28 days compressive strength and sorptivity and between 28 days compressive strength and chloride penetration of geopolymer concretes.",

    "abstract": "Increasing emphasis on energy conservation and environmental protection has led to the investigation of the alternatives to customary building materials. Some of the significant goals behind understaking such investigations are to reduce the greenhouse gasemissions and minimize the energy required formaterial production.The usage of concrete around the world is second only to water. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is conventionally used as the primary binder to produce concrete. The cement production is a significant industrial activity in terms of its volume and contribution to greenhouse gas emission. Globally, the production of cement contributes at least 5 to 7 % of <TEX>$CO_2$</TEX>. Another major problem of the environment is to dispose off the fly ash, a hazardous waste material, which is produced by thermal power plant by combustion of coal in power generation processes. The geopolymer concrete aims at utilizing the maximum amount of fly ash and reduce <TEX>$CO_2$</TEX> emission in atmosphere by avoiding use of cement to making concrete. This paper reports an experimental work conducted to investigate the effect of curing conditions on the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete prepared by using fly ash as base material and combination of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate as alkaline activator.",

In this paper fly ash based geopolymer concretes with different percentages of alccofine were made by mixing sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate as an alkaline activator and cured at ambient as well as heat environment in an electric oven at <TEX>$90^{\\circ}C$</TEX>. Effects of various parameters such as the percentage of alccofine, curing temperature, a period of curing, fly ash content, was studied on compressive strength as well as workability of geopolymer concrete. The study concludes that the presence of alccofine improves the properties of geopolymer concrete during a fresh and hardened state of concrete. Geopolymer concrete in the presence of alccofine can be used for the general purpose of concrete as required compressive strength can be achieved even at ambient temperature. The 28 days compressive strength of 73 MPa, when cured at 90-degree Celsius, confirmed that it is also very suitable for precast concrete components.",

In order to find economically viable sources with environmentally friendly features, natural pozzolan pumice and blast furnace slag in 10-50% of replacement binary designs have been investigated for experiments on the properties of fresh concrete, mechanical properties, and durability. As a natural pozzolan, pumice does not require advanced equipment to prepare for consumption and only needs to be powdered. Pumice has been the main focus of this research because of simple preparation. Also to validate the results, in addition to the control specimens of each design, fly ash as a known powder has been evaluated. Moreover, ternary mixes of pumice and silica fume were investigated to enhance the obtained results of binary mixes. It was concluded that pumice and slag powders indicated favorable performance in the high percentage of replacement.",

Metakaolin (MK) is one of SCM material is acquired by calcinations of kaolinite. Universally utilised as pozzolanic material in concrete to enhance mechanical and durability properties. This study investigates the fresh and hardened properties of conventional concrete (CC) and self compacting concrete (SCC) by partially replacing cement with MK in diverse percentages. In CC and SCC, partial replacement of cement with MK varies from 5-20%. Fresh concrete properties of CC are conducted by slump test and compaction factor tests and for SCC, slump flow, T500, J-Ring, L-Box, V-Funnel and U-Box tests. Hardened concrete characteristics are investigated by compressive, split tensile and flexural strengths at age of 7, 28 and 90 days of curing under water. Carbonation depth, water absorption and density of MK based CC and SCC was also computed. Fresh concrete test results indicated that increase in MK replacement increases workability of concrete in a constant w/b ratio. Also, outcomes reveal that concrete integrating MK had greater compressive, flexural and split tensile strengths. Optimum replacement level of MK for cement was 10%, which increased mechanical properties and robustness properties of concrete.",

Distinctive outcome from several researches have been demonstrated here, particularly emphasizing on the fresh and hardened properties of concrete when blended with Silica Fume (Micro-silica or Nano-silica). The results showed a substantial enhancement in the mechanical properties of concrete when replaced with SF. The review also presented a brief idea of percentage replacement of SF in case of normal and high-strength concrete. A decreasing trend in workability (slump value) has been identified when there is a increase in percentage replacement of SF. It can be concluded that the optimize percentage of replacement with SF lies in the range of 8-10% particularly for compressive strength. However the variation of blending goes up to 12-15% in case of split tensile and flexure strength of concrete. The study also demonstrates the effect of silica fume on durability parameters like water absorption, permeability, sulphate attack and chloride attack.",

    "abstract": "Concrete surfaces, industrial floors, sidewalks, roads and parking lots are typically subjected to abrasions. Many studies indicated that the abrasion resistance is directly related to the ultimate strength of the cured concrete. Chemical reactions, freeze-thaw cycles, and damages under abrasion are among many factors negatively affecting the concrete strength and durability. One of the major solutions to address the abrasive resistance of the concrete is to use fibers. Fibers are used in the concrete mix to improve the mechanical properties, strength and limit the crack propagations. In this study, implementation of the steel fibers in concrete to enhance the abrasive resistance of the concrete is investigated in details. The abrasive resistance of the concrete with and without steel fibers is studied with the sandblasting technique. For this purpose, different concrete samples are made with various hooked steel fiber ratios and investigated with the sandblasting method for two different strike angles. In total, 144 ASTM verified cube samples are investigated and it is shown that those samples with the highest steel fiber ratios have the highest abrasive resistance. In addition, the experiments determine that there is a meaningful correlation between the steel fiber percentage in the mix, strike angle and curing time which could be considered for improving structural behavior of the fiber-reinforced concrete.",

Subsequently, the sound transmission losses through the samples have been measured at the range of 63 Hz up to 6300 Hz by using impedance tube and the transfer function. The results show specimens containing 15% fine-grained crumbs, the loss of sound transmission were up to 190%, and for samples with 15% coarse-grained rubber, the loss of sound transmission were up to 228%, respectively.

There is a growing awareness that specifications requiring high compressive strength make sense only when there are specific strength design advantages. HPC today employs blended cements that include silica fume, fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag. In typical formulations, these cementitious materials can exceed 25% of the total cement by weight. Silica fume contributes to strength and durability; and fly ash and slag cement to better finish, decreased permeability, and increased resistance to chemical attack.

Results represent that reducing the curing temperature about 15 degrees could result in 20% reduction in ultimate strength; however, decreasing the humidity percentage by 50% could lead to 10% reduction in ultimate strength.

For this purpose, three SCC mixes groups, were produced at a constant water to binder ratio of 0.38. Both fine and coarse recycled aggregates were used as natural aggregates (NA) replacement at different substitution levels of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by volume for each mix group. Each group, included 0, 15% or 30% GGBFS as Portland cement replacement by weight. The SCC properties investigated were self-compactability parameters (i.e., slump flow, T500 time, V-funnel flow time, L-box passing ability and sieve stability), compressive strength, capillary water absorption and water penetration depth. The results show that the combined use of RCA with GGBFS had a significant effect on fresh and hardened SCC mixes. The addition of both fine and coarse recycled aggregates as a substitution up to 50% of natural aggregates enhance the workability of SCC mixes, whereas the addition from 50 to 100% decreases the workability, whatever the slag content used as cement replacement. An enhancement of workability of SCC mixes with recycled aggregates was noticed as increasing GGBFS from 0 to 30%. RCA content of 25% to 50% as NA replacement and cement replacement of 15% GGBFS seems to be the optimum level to produce satisfactory SCC without any bleeding or segregation. Furthermore, the addition of slag to recycled concrete aggregates of SCC mixes reduces strength losses at the long term (56 and 90 days). However, a decrease in the capillary water absorption and water permeability depth was noticed, when using RCA mixes with slag.",

    "abstract": "The quantity of construction and demolition waste has been greatly increasing recently. It causes many problems to the environment. For this reason, demolition waste management becomes inevitable in order to overcome the environmental issues. The present study aims to evaluate the effects of using recycled coarse aggregate, which is generated from construction and demolition waste, on the properties of recycled aggregate concrete. An experimental investigation on the strength characteristics of concrete made with recycled coarse aggregate is presented and discussed in this paper. In this study, Portland Pozzolana Cement (fly ash based) is used instead of ordinary Portland cement. The results of this investigation show the possibility of the use of recycled coarse aggregates in the production of fresh concrete. Use of demolition waste as coarse aggregate will lead to a cleaner environment with a significant reduction of the consumption of natural resources. A comparative study on the strength characteristics of recycled aggregate concrete made with Ordinary Portland Cement and Portland Pozzolana Cement is presented and discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Exterior walls in buildings are exposed to various forms of thermal loads, which depend on the positions of walls.\r\nTherefore, one of the efficient methods for improving the energy competence of buildings is improving the thermal properties of insulation plaster mortar. In this study, lightweight fine aggregate (LWFA) and micro rubber ash (MRA) from recycled tires were used as partial replacements for sand. The flow ability, unit weight, compressive strength, tensile strength, thermal conductivity (K-value), drying shrinkage and microstructure scan of lightweight rubberized mortar (LWRM) were investigated. Ten mixtures\r\nof LWRM were prepared as follows: traditional cement mortar (control mixture); three mixes with different percentages of\r\nLWFA (25%, 50% and 75%); three mixes with different percentages of MRA (2.5%, 5% and 7.5%); and three mixes consisting both types with determined ratios (25% LWFA+5% MRA, 50% LWFA+5% MRA and 75% LWFA+5% MRA). The flow\r\nability of the mortars was 22+-2 cm, and LWRM contained LWFA and MRA. The compressive and tensile strength decreased by approximately 64% and 57%, respectively, when 75% LWFA was used compared with those when the control mix was used. The compressive and tensile strength decreased when 5% MRA was used. By contrast, mixes with determined ratios of LWFA and MRA affected reduced unit weight, K-value and dry shrinkage.",

    "abstract": "Electrical resistivity is a property associated with both the physical and chemical characteristics of concrete. It allows the evaluation of the greater or lesser difficulty with which aggressive substances penetrate the concrete's core before the dissolution of the passive film process and the consequent reinforcement's corrosion begin. This work addresses the capillary absorption of self-compacting concrete (SCC) with various types and contents of additions, correlating it with its electrical resistivity. To that effect, binary and ternary mixes of SCC were produced using fly ashes (FA) and limestone filler (LF). A total of 11 self-compactable mixes were produced: one with cement (C) only; three with C + FA in 30%, 60% and 70% substitution ratios; three with C + LF in 30%, 60% and 70% substitution ratios; four with C + FA + LF in combinations of 10-20%, 20-10%, 20-40% and 40-20% substitution ratios, respectively; and four reference mixes according to the LNEC E 464 specification, which refers to the NP EN 206-1 norm. The evaluation of the capillarity of the mixes produced was made through the determination of the water absorption by capillarity coefficient according to the LNEC E 393 specification. The electrical resistivity was evaluated using the European norm proposal presented by the EU-Project CHLORTEST (EU funded research Project under 5FP GROWTH programme) and based on the RILEM TC-154 EMC technical recommendation. The results indicate that SCC's capillarity is strongly conditioned by the type and quantity of the additions used. It was found that FA addition significantly improves some of the properties studied especially at older ages.",

The study reports the fresh and hardened properties of the geopolymer concrete (GPC) activated using alkaline solution. GPC were prepared using different RHA content (350, 375 and 400 kg/m3), the molarity of the NaOH (8, 12 and 16M). The specimens were cured at 27oC and 90oC. GPC was activated using NaOH, Na2SiO3, and alccofine. Prepared GPC samples were tested for compressive and splitting tensile strengths after 3, 7 and 28 days. \r\nRHA was suitable to produce geopolymer concrete. Results indicate that behavior of GPC prepared with RHA is similar to fly ash based GPC. Workability and strength can be improved by incorporating the alccofine. Further, alccofine and heat curing improve the early age properties of the GPC. Heat curing is responsible for the initial polymerization of GPC which leads to high workability and improved mechanical properties of the GPC. High strength can be achieved by using the high concentration alkaline solution in terms of molarity and at elevated heat curing. Further, RHA based geopolymer concrete has tremendous potential as a substitute for ordinary concrete.",

The tensile behavior of corroded bars with different corrosion patterns was examined carefully, as were two non-corroded bars extracted from a 26-year-old control beam. The results show that corrosion leads to an increase in the ratio of the ultimate strength over the yield strength, but reduces the ultimate strain at maximum force of the reinforcement. Both the corrosion pattern and the corrosion intensity play an important role in the ductile properties. The asymmetrical distribution of the corrosion around the surface is a decisive factor, which can influence the ultimate strain at maximum force more seriously.",

The use of fibres reduces the spalling and explosive failure of steel, basalt and hybrid steel-basalt fibres reinforced concretes oppose to spalling in deeper regions of ordinary control concrete after exposure to above elevated temperatures.

Three mineral admixtures (fly ash, silica fume and lime sludge) were used as a partial replacement of cement in the preparation of blended concrete mix. The durability of ternary blended cement concrete mix was studied by exposing it to acids HCl and H2SO4 at 5% concentration. Acid mass loss factors (AMLF), acid strength loss factor (ASLF) and acid durability factor (ADF) were determined, and the results were compared with the control mix. Chloride ions penetration was investigated by conducting rapid chlorination penetration test and accelerated corrosion penetration test on control mix and ternary blended cement concrete. From the results, it was evident that the usage of these mineral admixtures is having a beneficiary role on the strength as well as durability properties. The results inferred that the utilization of these materials as a partial replacement of cement have significantly enhanced the compressive strength of blended concrete mix in 30 MPa, 50 MPa and 70 MPa by 42.95%, 32.48% and 22.79%. The blended concrete mix shown greater resistance to acid attack compared to control mix concrete.

In the first phase, the composition of the quaternary composite binder compromised CEM I 42.5N (58-70%), Rice Husk Ash (25-37%), quartz sand (2.5-7.5%) and limestone crushing waste (2.5-7.5%) were optimized. And in the second phase, the effect of two fiber types (steel brass-plated and basalt) was investigated on the SCC optimized with the optimum CB as disperse reinforcement at 6 different ratios of 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0% by weight of mix for each type. In this study, the theoretical principles of the synthesis of self-compacting dispersion-reinforced concrete have been developed which consists of optimizing structure-formation processes through the use of a mineral modifier, together with ground crushed cement in a vario-planetary mill to a specific surface area of 550 m2 / kg. The amorphous silica in the modifier composition intensifies the binding of calcium hydroxide formed during the hydration of C3S, helps reduce the basicity of the cement-composite, while reducing the growth of portlandite crystals. Limestone particles contribute to the formation of calcium hydrocarbonate and, together with fine ground quartz sand; act as microfiller, clogging the pores of the cement. Furthermore, the results revealed that the effect of fiber addition improves the mechanical properties of FRSCC. It was found that the steel fiber performed better than basalt fiber on tensile strength and modulus of elasticity; however, both fibers have the same performance on the first crack strength and sample destruction of FRSCC. It also illustrates that there will be an optimum percentage of fiber addition.",

A comparison study was performed considering HSC members and hybrid beams fabricated by HSC and conventional normal concrete (CC). In addition to the experiments on the influence of glass powder on flexural behavior, numerical analysis was implemented using nonlinear finite element approach to simulate the structural performance of the beams. Same constitutive relationships were selected to model the behavior of HSC with waste glass powder or silica fume\r\nto show the matching between the modeling outputs for beams made with these powders. The results showed that the loading\r\ncapacity and ductility index of the HSC beams with waste glass powder demonstrated enhancing ultimate load and ductility compared with those of HSC specimens with silica fume.

It consists of binder and fine aggregate and moreover, it is an essential associate in any reinforced structural construction. The strength of mortar is a special concern to the engineer because mortar is responsible to give protection in the outer part of the structure as well as at a brick joint in masonry wall system. The purpose of this research is to investigate the compressive strength and tensile strength of mortar, which are important mechanical properties, by replacing the cement and sand by stone dust. Moreover, to minimize the increasing demand of cement and sand, checking of appropriateness of stone dust as a construction material is necessary to ensure both solid waste minimization and recovery by exchanging stone dust with cement and sand. Stone dust passing by No. 200 sieve, is used as cement replacing material and retained by No. 100 sieve is used for sand replacement. Sand was replaced by stone dust of 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% and 50% by weight of sand while cement was replaced by stone dust of 3%, 5%, and 7% by weight of cement. Test result indicates that, compressive strength of specimen mix with 35% of sand replacing stone dust and 3% of cement replacing stone dust increases 21.33% and 22.76% respectively than the normal mortar specimen at 7 and 28 days while for tensile it increases up to 13.47%.

The environmental and economic aspects of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) containing concrete have led research studies to investigate the possibility of incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in concrete. Metakaolin (MK) is one SCM with high pozzolanic reactivity generated throughout the thermal activation of high purity kaolinite clay at a temperature ranging from 500oC to 800oC. Although many studies have evaluated the effect of MK on mechanical properties of concrete and have reported positive effects, limited articles are considering the effect of MK on durability properties of concrete. Considering the lifetime assessment of concrete structures, the durability of concrete has become of particular interest recently. In the present work, the influences of MK on mechanical and durability properties of concrete mixtures are evaluated. Various experiments such as slump flow test, compressive strength, water permeability, freeze and thaw cycles, rapid chloride penetration and surface resistivity tests were carried out to determine mechanical and durability properties of concretes. Concretes made with the incorporation of MK revealed better mechanical and durability properties compared to control concretes due to combined pozzolanic reactivity and the filler effect of MK.",

    "abstract": "This concrete is one of the most versatile construction material widely used for almost a century now. It was considered to be very durable material and required a little or no maintenance since long time. The assumption is very true, except when it is subjected to highly aggressive environments. The deterioration of concrete structures day by day due to aggressive environment is compelling engineers to assess the loss in advance so that proper preventive measure can be taken to achieve required durability to concrete structures. The compounds present in cement concrete are attacked by many salt solutions and acids. These chemicals are encountered by almost all concrete structures. The present study has been undertaken to investigate the effect of attack of chlorides and sulphates with varying severity on compressive strength of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) concrete after immersion in salt solution for 28 days. The results indicate that the durability of GGBFS concrete increases with the increase in percentage replacement of cement by GGBFS for 20% and then gradually decreases with increases in percentage of GGBFS with cement (as in the study for 40% and 60%). Also there is increase in strength of GGBFS concrete with increase in age. Thus the durability of concrete improves when GGBFS is added as partial replacement of cement. In this study the strength of GGBFS concrete is less affected by chemicals as compared to conventional concrete when exposed to aggressive environment.",

Numerous tests, which consist of mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), thermosgravi metric (TG) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted. Various characterization techniques which include, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform microscopy along with X-ray diffraction evaluations were conducted on the samples to examine phase formation and crystallinity, morphology and microstructure along with bond formations and functional groups, respectively. During long-term study, the performance of concrete which consisted of limestone and flash-calcined was close to those from standard Portland cement concrete. Traditional classifications and methods of corrosion were widely used for the assessment of steel in concrete which may get employed to concrete which contains LC3 to recalibrate the range of polarization resistance for passitivity condition. For example, there is up to 79.5% and 146% respective flexural and compressive strengths. Moreover, they developed more advance electrical and thermo-mechanical performance with a substantial reduction in absorption of water of close to 400%. These advantages allow this research crucial to evaluate how these methods can be applied. Additionally, the research evaluates developed and more advanced cement preservation and repair techniques. The conclusion suggests concerted efforts by various stakeholders such as policy makers to enable low-carbon rates.",

    "abstract": "The main aim of the current research is to investigate the flexural behavior of the reinforced concrete (RC) slabs strengthened with strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCC) experimentally and numerically. Seven RC slabs were prepared and tested under four-points loading test. One un-strengthened slab considered as control specimen while six RC slabs were strengthened with reinforced SHCC layers. The SHCC layers had different reinforcement ratios and different thicknesses. The results showed that the proposed strengthening techniques significantly increased the ultimate failure load and the ductility index up to 25% and 22%, respectively, compared to the control RC slab. Moreover, a three dimensional (3D) finite element model was proposed to analyze the strengthened RC slabs. It was found that the results of the proposed numerical model well agreed with the experimental responses. The validated numerical model used to study many parameters of the SHCC layer such as the reinforcement ratios and the different thicknesses. In addition, steel connectors were suggested to adjoin the concrete/SHCC interface to enhance the flexural performance of the strengthened RC slabs. It was noticed that using the SHCC layer with thickness over 40 mm changed the failure mode from the concrete cover separation to the SHCC layer debonding. Also, the steel connectors prevented the debonding failure pattern and enhanced both the ultimate failure load and the ductility index. Furthermore, a theoretical equation was proposed to predict the ultimate load of the tested RC slabs. The theoretical and experimental ultimate loads are seen to be in fairly good agreement.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen and phosphorus contained in storm water runoff contaminate both surface and ground waters, causing\r\nproblems for natural aquatic systems and human health. Pervious concrete particularly developed for pollutant removal might be a novel notion to remove nitrate from runoff. In this research, three aggregates were used in pervious concrete as Nano silica, perlite (Pe) and zeolite (Z) which are able to adsorb pollutants. The water absorption, compressive strength, porosity, permeability of aggregate and nitrate removal of concrete samples were evaluated in tests. While adding Nano silica, perlite and\r\nzeolite, experiments have shown that addition of fine grains enhances runoff efficiency and compressive strength, but reduces permeability and porosity. Both adsorbents improved the runoff quality while increasing the additives' ratio. The mechanical properties were density of 879 (Kg/m3), permeability of 1.06 (cm/s), the void rate of 19.7(%), compressive strength of 3.6 (MPa), and nitrate removal of about 75%. While adding perlite with the highest (40%) water absorption, the results showed no reactivity of aggregates in terms of alkali-silica reaction. Considering the Permeability tests, perlite has the minimum (1.4 cm/s)\r\npermeability, and then adding perlite to previous concrete brought the nitrate absorption capacity about 70 ml/g (60%). The best results belonged to samples containing zeolite treatments (with 15% adsorbent and 0, 10, 20% fine-grains) with a maximum pollution decline and improved Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (87.1, 82.6 and 89.3%), Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (88.1, 87.3 and 90.7%) and Total suspended solids (TSS) (75.8, 79.1 and 84.6%). Thus, zeolite has shown effective mechanical characteristics and runoff quality, while perlite and Nano silica has shown a poor and moderate performance among the adsorbents in all tests, respectively.",

Twenty-four slabs and beams were fabricated with respect to the concrete mix and these specimens were tested in impact load experiment. Testing observations revealed that the maximum dynamic deflection or ductility of the member can be achieved with increasing the fiber length.

Indeed, it consists in studying the effect of the sand type on the main properties of sand concrete: fracture and mechanical properties. We particularly insist on the determination of the fracture characteristics of this material which apparently have not been studied. To carry out this study, four different types of sand have been used: dune sand (DS), river sand (RS), crushed sand (CS) and river-dune sand (RDS). These sands differ in mineralogical nature, grain shape, angularity, particle size, proportion of fine elements, etc. The obtained results show that the particle size distribution of sand has marked its influence in all the studied properties of sand concrete since the sand having the highest diameter and the best particle size distribution has given the best fracture and mechanical properties. The grain shape, the angularity and the nature of sand have also marked their influence: thanks to its angularity and its limestone nature, crushed sand yielded good results compared to river and dune sands which are characterized by rounded shape and siliceous nature. Finally, it should further be noted that the sand concrete presents values of fracture and mechanical properties slightly lower than those of ordinary concrete. Compared to mortar, although the mechanical strength is lower, the fracture parameters are almost comparable. In all cases, the sand grains are debonded from the paste cement during the fracture which means that the crack goes through the paste-aggregate interface.",

    "abstract": "Upon completion of new concrete structures, the achieved construction quality always shows a high scatter and variability, and in severe environments, any weaknesses and deficiencies will soon be revealed whatever durability specifications and materials have been applied. To a certain extent, a probability approach to the durability design can take the high scatter and variability into account. However, numerical solutions alone are not sufficient to ensure the durability and service life of concrete structures in severe environments. In the present paper, the basis for a probability-based durability design is briefly outlined and discussed. As a result, some performance-based durability requirements are specified which are used for quality control and quality assurance during concrete construction. The final documentation of achieved construction quality and compliance with the specified durability are key to any rational approach to more controlled and increased durability. As part of the durability design, a service manual for future condition assessment and preventive maintenance of the structure is also produced. It is such a service manual which helps provide the ultimate basis for achieving a more controlled durability and service life of the given concrete structure in the given environment.",

This paper presents the strength characteristics of geopolymer concrete (GPC) developed with fly ash and GGBS as binders, combined Sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) solution as alkaline activators. The parameters considered in this research work are proportions of fly ash and GGBS (70-30 and 50-50), curing conditions (Outdoor curing and oven curing at 600oC for 24 hours), two grades of concrete (GPC20 and GPC50).The mechanical properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength along with durability characteristics were determined. For studying the durability characteristics of geopolymer concrete 5% H2SO4 solutions was used and the specimens were immersed up to an exposure period of 56 days. The main parameters considered in this study were Acid Mass Loss Factor (AMLF), Acid Strength Loss Factor (ASLF) and products of degradation. The results conclude that GPC with sufficient strength can be developed even under Outdoor curing using fly ash and GGBS combination i.e., without the need for any heat curing.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the experimental results of twenty three reinforced concrete beams with rectangular web openings externally strengthened with Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP) composites bonded around openings. All tested beams had the same geometry and reinforcement details. At openings locations, the stirrups intercepted the openings were cut during fabrication of reinforcement cage to simulate the condition of inclusion of an opening in an existing beam. Several design parameters are considered including the opening dimensions and location in the shear zone, the wrapping configurations, and the amount and the type of the FRP composites in the vicinity of the openings. The wrapping configurations of FRP included: sheets, strips, U-shape strips, and U-shape strips with bundles of FRP strands placed at the top and sides of the beam forming a fan under the strips to achieve closed wrapping. The effect of these parameters on the failure modes, the ultimate load, and the beam stiffness were investigated. The shear contribution of FRP on the shear capacity of tested beams with web openings was estimated according to ACI Committee 440-08, Canadian Standards S6-06, and Khalifa et al. model and examined against the test results. A modification factor to account for the dimensions of opening chords was applied to the predicted gain in the shear capacity according to ACI 440-08 and CSA S6-06 for bonded Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) around openings. The analytical results after incorporating the modification factor into the codes guidelines showed good agreement with the test results.",

The performance of SCC in moderate climate is well investigated but few studies are available on the effect of hot environment. In this paper, the effect of initial water-curing period and curing conditions on the performance of SCC is reported. Cement was substituted by GGBFS by weight at two different levels of substitution (15% and 25%). Concrete specimens were stored either in a standard environment (T=20oC, RH=100%) or in the open air in North Africa during the summer period (T=35 to 40oC; R.H=50 to 60%) after an initial humid curing period of 0, 3, 7 or 28 days. Compressive strength at 28 and 90 days, capillary absorption, sorptivity, water permeability, porosity and chloride ion penetration were investigated. The results show that the viscosity and yield stress are decreased with increasing dosage of GGBFS. The importance of humid curing in hot climates in particular when GGBFS is used is also proved. The substitution of cement by GGBFS improves SCC durability at long term. The best performances were observed in concrete specimens with 25% GGBFS and for 28 days water curing.",

For this purpose, concrete mixtures are produced by substituting cement with metakaolin 0, 5, 10 and 20% by weight. The amount of binder for the concrete mixtures are 300 and 400 kg/m3 with a constant water to cement ratio of 0.6. Compressive and bending strengths, freeze-thaw and high-temperature resistances, capillary coefficients and rapid chloride permeability properties were determined and compared each other. Because of all the experiments conducted, it has been found that the use of metakaolin as a pozzolanic additive in concrete have positive effects especially on compressive and bending strengths, capillary, rapid chloride permeability, freeze-thaw resistance, and high temperatures, up to 800oC. The results indicated that the performance of concrete can be enhanced by metakaolin. Particularly, compressive strength and durability properties have found to be improved with increasing metakaolin content which is attributed to pozzolanic activity and filler effect. Furthermore, metakaolin has relatively positive impacts under elevated temperatures and freeze-thaw effects. However, almost all the strengths of entire concrete specimens are lost at 800",

The samples were made from a mixture of water, fine sand and cement, respectively. Concrete samples with a hole at its center was prepared and subjected to tensile loading using the compression to tensile load converter device. A hydraulic load cell applied compressive loading to converter device with a constant pressure of 0.02 MPa per second. Compressive loading was converted to tensile stress on the sample because of the overall test design. The samples have three different configurations related to loading axis; 0, <TEX>$45^{\\circ}$</TEX>, <TEX>$-45^{\\circ}$</TEX>. A series of finite element analysis were done to analyze the effect of hole diameter on stress concentration of the hole side along its horizontal axis to provide a suitable criterion for determining the real tensile strength of concrete. Concurrent with indirect tensile test, Brazilian test and three point loading test were also performed to compare the results from the three methods. Results obtained by this device were quite encouraging and show that the tensile strengths of concrete were similar in different directions because of the homogeneity of bonding between the concrete materials. Also, the indirect tensile strength was clearly lower than the Brazilian test strength and three point loading test.",

The carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) fabrics were used to evaluate the performances of the confined and unconfined ECC specimens under static and cyclic loading in the acidic environment. In addition, the use of CFRP and BFRP fabrics as a rehabilitation technique was also studied for the specimens exposed to the sulphuric acid environment. The polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber with a fraction of 2% was used in the research. Two different PVA-ECC concretes were produced using low lime fly ash (LCFA) and high lime fly ash (HCFA) with the fly ash-to-OPC ratio of 1.2. Unwrapped PVA-ECC specimens were also produced as a reference concrete and all concrete specimens were continuously immersed in 5% sulphuric acid solution (H2SO4). The mechanical performance and the durability of specimens were evaluated by means of the visual inspection, weight change, static and cyclic loading, and failure mode. In addition, microscopic changes of the PVA-ECC specimens due to sulphuric acid attack were also assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to understand the macroscale behavior of the specimens. Results indicated that PVA-ECC specimens produced with low lime fly ash (LCFA) showed superior performance than the specimens produced with high lime fly ash (HCFA) in the acidic environment. In addition, confinement of ECC specimens with BFRP and CFRP fabrics significantly improved compressive strength, ductility, and durability of the specimens. PVA-ECC specimens wrapped with carbon FRP fabric showed better mechanical performance and durability properties than the specimens wrapped with basalt FRP fabric. Both FRP materials can be used as a rehabilitation material in the acidic environment.",

Besides, to make comparison possible, water to binder ratio and the amount of solid contents were kept constant. Four fiber dosages of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2% (by concrete volume) were considered for monotype fiber reinforced mixes, while the total amount of fiber were kept 1% for hybrid fiber reinforced mixes. Three different portions of glass and basalt fiber were considered for hybridization of fibers to show the best cocktail for hybrid basalt-glass fiber. Test results indicated that the fracture energy of mix is highly dependent on both fiber dosage and temperature. Moreover, the hybrid fiber reinforced mixes showed the highest fracture energies in comparison with monotype fiber reinforced specimens with 1% fiber volume fraction. In general, hybridization has played a leading role in the improvement of mechanical properties and fracture behavior of mixes, while compared to monotype fiber reinforced specimens, hybridization has led to lower amounts of compressive strength.",

The results show that corrosion leads to an increase in the ratio of the ultimate strength over the yield strength, but reduces the ultimate strain at maximum force of the reinforcement. Both the corrosion pattern and the corrosion intensity play an important role in the ductile properties. The asymmetrical distribution of the corrosion around the surface is a decisive factor, which can influence the ultimate strain at maximum force more seriously.",

    "abstract": "Post earthquake fire (PEF) can lead to the collapse of buildings that are partially damaged in a prior ground-motion that occurred immediately before the fire. The majority of standards and codes for the design of structures against earthquake ignore the possibility of PEF and thus buildings designed with those codes could be too weak when subjected to a fire after an earthquake. An investigation based on sequential analysis inspired by FEMA356 is performed here on the Life-Safety performance level of structures designed to the ACI 318-08 code after they are subjected to two different earthquake levels with PGA of 0.35 g and 0.25 g. This is followed by a four-hour fire analysis of the weakened structure, from which the time it takes for the weakened structure to collapse is calculated. As a benchmark, the fire analysis is also performed for undamaged structure and before occurrence of earthquake. The results show that the vulnerability of structures increases dramatically when a previously damaged structure is exposed to PEF. The results also show the damaging effects of post earthquake fire are exacerbated when initiated from second and third floor. Whilst the investigation is for a certain class of structures (regular building, intermediate reinforced structure, 3 stories), the results confirm the need for the incorporation of post earthquake fire in the process of analysis and design and provides some quantitative measures on the level of associated effects.",

To assess the fibre reinforcement effectiveness in shallow structural elements failing in bending and in shear, experimental and numerical research were performed. Uniaxial compression and bending tests were executed to derive the constitutive laws of the developed SFRC. Using a cross-section layered model and the material constitutive laws, the deformational behaviour of structural elements failing in bending was predicted from the moment-curvature relationship of the representative cross sections. To evaluate the influence of the percentage of fibres on the shear resistance of shallow structures, three point bending tests with shallow beams were performed. The applicability of the formulation proposed by RILEM TC 162-TDF for the prediction of the shear resistance of SFRC elements was evaluated. Inverse analysis was adopted to determine indirectly the values of the fracture mode I parameters of the developed SFRC. With these values, and using a softening diagram for modelling the crack shear softening behaviour, the response of the SFRC beams failing in shear was predicted.",

India produces approximately 23.75 million tons of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) annually. The natural resources are depleting at a higher rate with the increasing demand of concrete industry. This difficulty can be reduced with the use of RCA in land fill and concrete manufacturing. Use of RCA can provide cost savings and better energy utilization.

In mix design successive recycled concrete aggregate (SRCA) was used in place of natural aggregates (NA) with 100% replacement.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the influence of various mix design parameters on the characteristics of concrete containing recycled coarse aggregates and Nano-Silica using Taguchi method. The present study adopts Water-cement ratio, Recycled Coarse Aggregate (%), Maximum cement content and Nano-Silica (%) as factors with each one having three different levels. Using the above mentioned control parameters with levels an Orthogonal Array (OA) matrix experiments of L9 (34) has selected and nine number of concrete mixes has been prepared. Compressive Strength, Split Tensile Strength, Flexural Tensile Strength, Modulus of Elasticity and Non-Destructive parameters are selected as responses. Experimental results are analyzed and the optimum level for each response is predicted. Analysis of 28 days CS depicts that NS (%) is the most significant factor among all factors. Analysis of the tensile strength results indicates that the effect of control factor W/C ratio is ranked one and then NS (%) is ranked two which suggests that W/C ratio and NS (%) have more influence as compared to other two factors. However, the factor that affects the modulus of elasticity most is found to be RCA (%). Finally, validation experiments have been carried out with the optimal mixture of concrete with Nano-Silica for the desired engineering properties of recycled aggregate concrete. Moreover, the comparative study of the predicted and experimental results concludes that errors between both experimental and predicted values are within the permissible limits. This present study highlights the application of Taguchi method as an efficient tool in determining the effects of constituent materials in mix proportioning of concrete.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the effect of different micro-silica (MS) contents of 5, 10 and 15 wt.% as partial replacement of cement on mechanical and durability properties of high volume fly ash - recycled aggregate concretes (HVFA-RAC) containing 50% class F fly ash (FA) and 35% recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) as partial replacement of cement and natural coarse aggregate (NCA), respectively. The measured mechanical and durability properties are compressive strength, indirect tensile strength, elastic modulus, drying shrinkage, water sorptivity and chloride permeability. The effects of different curing ages of 7, 28, 56 and 91 days on above properties are also considered in this study. The results show that the addition of MS up to 10% improved the early age (7 days) strength properties of HVFA-RAC, however, at later ages (e.g. 28-91 days) the above mechanical properties are improved for all MS contents. The 5% MS exhibited the best performance among all MS contents for all mechanical properties of HVFA-RAC. In the case of measured durability properties, mix results are obtained, where 10% and 5% MS exhibited the lowest sorptivity and drying shrinkage, respectively at all ages. However, in the case of chloride ion permeability a decreasing trend is observed with increase in MS contents and curing ages. Strong correlations of indirect tensile strength and modulus of elasticity with square root of compressive strength are also observed in HVFA-RAC. Nevertheless, it is established in this study that MS contributes to the sustainability of HVFA-RAC significantly by improving the mechanical and durability properties of concrete containing 50%less cement and 35% less natural coarse aggregates.",

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis was carried out for analysing elemental composition of sandstone. There was no sulphur content in sandstone which is a good sign to carry the replacement. Fine aggregate was replaced with sandstone at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by volume and moulds of concrete cubes and cylinders were prepared. Compressive strength of concrete cubes was tested after 3, 7 and 28 days and split tensile & flexural strength was determined after 28 days. The strength was found to be increasing marginally with increase in sandstone content. Fine aggregate that was replaced by 100% sandstone gave highest strength among all the replacements for the compressive, split tensile and flexural strengths. Though increase in strength was marginal, still sandstone can be an effective replacement for sand in order to save the natural resource and utilize the waste sandstone.",

Next, for optimizing the output equation, hybrid genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and grey wolf optimization (GWO) methods have been utilized to find the optimal conclusions. It could be concluded that for both predictions of CS and TS, all models have the coefficient of determination (R2) larger than 0.949 and 0.9138, respectively. Furthermore, between three hybrid algorithms, MARS-PSO could be proposed as the best model to obtain the most accuracy in the prediction of CS and TS.

Hypo sludge, when disposed of as landfill, contributes to the groundwater contamination caused by the leachates. Hence, the utilization of hypo sludge from the paper industry in the construction applications promotes the development of sustainable concrete; reduces landfills, and creates an environment free from harmful wastes. In the present context, this research focused on the partial replacement of cement by hypo sludge. It was observed that even though the addition of 10% of hypo sludge was sufficient to produce sustainable concrete, there was a negative influence on the durability as more water absorption was observed due to the presence of high cellulose fibre content. Hence styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) latex and basalt fibres were added to improve its durability and post cracking behaviour respectively. A significant improvement in the strength and durability was observed when 10% of hypo sludge as a cement replacement is used in combination with 0.25% of basalt fibres and 10% of SBR latex when compared with the conventional concrete. The micro structural studies revealed that SBR latex produced better consistency in the interaction among the phases of concrete.",

    "abstract": "Concrete is the most widely used material of construction. Concrete gained the popularity as a construction material due to the easy availability of its component materials, the easy formability, strength and rigidity upon setting and curing.In construction industry, strength is the primary criterion in selecting a concrete for a particular application. Now a days, the substantial amount of waste materials, containing the properties of the Pozzolana, is being generated from the major industries; and disposal of such industrial wastes generated in abundance is also a serious problem from the environmental and pollution point of view. On this backdrop, efforts are made by the researchers for exploring the possible utilization of such waste materials in making the sustainable construction material. The present paper reports the experimental investigations to study the strength characterization of concrete made from the pozzolanic waste materials. For this purpose, the Pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag were used as a cement replacing materials in conjunction with ordinary Portland cement. Equal amount of these materials were used in eight trial mixes with varying amount of cement. The water cement ratio was also varied. The chemical admixture was also added to improve the workability of concrete. The compressive strengths for 7, 28, 40 and 90 days' were evaluated whereas the flexural and tensile strengths corresponding to 7, 28 and 40 days were evaluated. The study corroborates that the pozzolanic materials used in the present investigation along with the cement can render the sustainable concrete.",

Fly ash (FA) was substituted with GGBFS with the replacement levels being 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% by weight in each SCGC series. Steel fiber (SF) wasn\\'t employed in the assembly of the initial concrete series whereas, within the second concrete series, an SF combination was achieved by a constant additional level of 1% by volume. Fresh properties of mixtures were through an experiment investigated in terms of slump flow diameter, T50 slump flow time, V-funnel flow time, and L-box height ratio. Moreover, the mechanical performance of the SCGCs was evaluated in terms of compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and fracture toughness. Furthermore, a statistical analysis was applied in order to judge the importance of the experimental parameters, like GGBFS and SF contents. The experimental results indicated that the incorporation of SF had no vital impact on the fresh characteristics of the SCGC mixtures whereas GGBFS aggravated them. However, the incorporation of GGBFS was considerably improved the mechanical properties of SCGCs. Moreover, the incorporation of SF with the total different quantity of GGBFS\r\nreplacement has considerably increased the mechanical properties of SCGCs, by close to (65%) for the splitting strength and (200%) for compressive strength.",

In this research, HFFA is studied with the emphasis on the utilization of this waste material in concrete blocks and asphalt concrete mixes. Two types of mixes, one with low and other with high cement content, were studied for concrete blocks. Different mixes having varying percentages of HFFA (0% to 25%), as cement/sand replacement or as an additive, were studied. The performance of concrete blocks is evaluated in terms of compressive strength, water absorption, durability and environmental concerns. The results showed that blocks cannot be cast if more than 15% HFFA is used; also there is a marginal reduction in the strength of all the mixes before and after being exposed to the sulfate solution for a period of ten months. HFFA is studied in asphalt concrete mixes in two ways, as an asphalt modifier (3&5%) and as a filler (50%) replacement, the results showed an improvement in stiffness and fatigue life of mixes. However, the stability and indirect tensile strength loss were found to be high as compared to the control mix due to moisture damage, indicating a need of using antistripping agents. On environmental concerns, it was found that most of the concerned elements are within acceptable limits also it is observed that lower concentration of barium is leached out with the higher HFFA concentrations, which indicates that HFFA may work as an adsorbent for this leaching element.",

The mixtures containing higher ratio of macro steel fiber exhibit numerous micro-cracks and, thus, deflectionhardening response is observed. The mixture containing 1% micro steel fiber shows worst performance in the view of all flexural parameters.

Test results showed that the stress-strain curves of seawater sea sand concrete were steeper than that of ordinary concrete, which indicated that seawater sea sand concrete was slightly more brittle. On the whole, the sea sand replacement rate had no significant effect on the axial compressive properties of sea sand concrete. Under\r\nthe same sea sand replacement rate, the deformation performance of freshwater sea sand concrete (FSC) was slightly greater than that of seawater sea sand concrete (SSC).

    "abstract": "In the present day scenario, concrete construction is rapidly becoming uneconomical and non sustainable practice, due to the scarcity of raw materials and environmental pollution caused by the manufacturing of cement. In this study an attempt has been made to propose recycled aggregates from demolition wastes as coarse aggregate in geopolymer concrete (GPC). Experimental investigations have been conducted to find optimum percentage of recycled aggregates (RA) in GPC by replacing 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of coarse aggregates by RA to produce recycled aggregate geopolymer concrete (RGPC). From the study it has been found that the optimum replacement percentage of recycled aggregates was 40% based on mechanical properties and workability. In order to study and compare the flexural behaviour of RGPC and GPC four beams of size <TEX>$175mm{\\times}150mm{\\times}1200mm$</TEX> were prepared and tested under two point loading. Test results were evaluated with respect to first crack load, ultimate load, load-deflection characteristics, ductility and energy absorption characteristics. Form the experimental study it can be concluded that the addition of recycled aggregate in GPC causes slight reduction in its strength and ductility. Since the percentage reduction in strength and behaviour of RGPC is meager compared to GPC it can be recommended as a sustainable and environment friendly construction material.",

The bamboo strip to be used as\r\nreinforcement inside concrete is first treated with chemical adhesive to make the bamboo surface impermeable. Various surface coatings are explored to understand their water repellant properties. The chemical action at the bamboo concrete interface is studied through different chemical coatings, sand blasting, and steel wire wrapping treatment. Whereas mechanical action at the bamboo concrete interface is studied by developing mechanical interlock. The result of pullout tests revealed a unique combination of surface treatment and grooved bamboo profile. This combination of surface treatment and a grooved bamboo\r\nprofile together enhances the strength of bond. Performance of a newly developed grooved bamboo strip is verified against equivalent plain rectangular bamboo strip. The test results show that the proposed grooved bamboo reinforcement, when treated, shows highest bond strength compared to treated plain, untreated plain and untreated grooved bamboo reinforcement. Also, it is observed that bond strength is majorly influenced by the type of surface treatment, size and spacing of groove. The changes in\r\nbamboo-concrete bond behavior are observed during the experimentation.",

These fine materials also contribute to reducing the construction cost and the consumption of natural resources. Many studies have confirmed the benefits of these mineral admixtures on properties of SCC in standard curing conditions. However, there are few published reports regarding their effects at elevated curing temperatures. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of three different mineral admixtures namely limestone powder (LP), granulated blast furnace slag (GS) and natural pozzolana (PZ) on mechanical properties and porosity of SCC when exposed to different curing temperatures (20, 40, 60 and 80oC). The level of substitution of cement by mineral admixture was fixed at 15%. The results showed that increasing curing temperature causes an improvement in performance at an early age without penalizing its long-term properties. However the temperature of 40oC is considered the optimal curing temperature to make economical and high performance SCC. On the other hand, GS is the most suitable mineral admixture for SCC under elevated curing temperature.",

A methodology is presented to quantify this influence in a Bayesian framework based on prior knowledge with respect to the hyperparameters of concrete strength distributions. An algorithm is presented in order to update prior distributions through numerical integration, taking into account the operating characteristic of the applied conformity criteria, calculated based on Monte Carlo simulations. Different examples are given to derive suitable hyperparameters for incoming strength distributions of concrete offered for conformity assessment, using updated available prior information, maximum-likelihood estimators or a bootstrap procedure. Furthermore, the updating procedure based on direct as well as indirect information obtained by conformity assessment is illustrated and used to quantify the filtering effect of conformity criteria on concrete strength distributions in case of a specific set of conformity criteria.",

To do so, two series of compositions each of which consists of twelve mixes, with water to binder (W/B) ratios of 0.35 and 0.4 were cast. Three different silica fume/binder ratios of 0, 5%, and 10% were considered along with four different polymer/binder ratios of 0, 5%, 10%, and 15%. Afterwards, the rupture modulus, tensile strength, 14-day, 28-day, and 90-day compressive strength, the UPV and the electrical resistance of the mixes were tested. The results indicated that although the use of polymer could enhance the passing and filling abilities, it could lead to a decrease of segregation resistance. In addition, the interaction of the SF and the polymeric contents enhanced the workability. However, the impacts regarding the use of polymeric contents on fresh state properties of SCLC were more prevalent than those regarding the use of SF. Besides the fresh state properties, the durability and mechanical properties of the mixes were affected due to the use of polymeric and SF contents. In other words, the use of the SF and the polymer enhanced the durability and mechanical properties of SCLC specimens.",

Furthermore crack propagation at certain load levels were inspected and visualized for each RCHB mode. The results confirm that RCHBs have different behavior in shear as compared to the prismatic beams. At the same time, different mechanical behavior was observed between the modes of RCHBs. Therefore, RCHBs were classified into three modes according to the inclination shape and mode of failure (Modes A, B and C). However, it was observed that there is no significant difference between RCHBs and prismatic beams regarding flexural behavior. Moreover, a new and unified formula was proposed to predict the critical effective depth of all modes of RCHBs that is very useful to predict the critical section for failure.",

    "abstract": "One of the main applications of FRP composites is confining concrete columns. Hence identifying the cyclic and monotonic stress-strain behavior of confined concrete columns and the parameters influencing this behavior is inevitable. Two significant parameters affecting the stress-strain behavior are aspect ratio and corner radius. The present study aims to scrutinize the effects of corner radius and aspect ratio on different aspects of stress-strain behavior of FRP confined concrete specimens (rectangular, square and circular). Hence 44 FRP confined concrete specimens were tested and the results of the tests were investigated. The findings indicated that for specimens with different aspect ratios, the relationship between the ultimate stress and the corner radius is linear and the variations of the ultimate stress versus the corner radius decreases as a result of an increase in aspect ratio. It was also observed that increase of the corner radius results in increase of the compressive strength and ultimate axial strain and increase of the aspect ratio causes an increase of the ultimate axial strain but a decrease of the compressive strength. Investigation of the ultimate condition showed that the FRP hoop rupture strain is smaller in comparison with the one obtained from the tensile coupon test and also the ultimate axial strain and confined concrete strength are smaller when a prism is under monotonic loading. Other important results of this study were, an increase in the axial strain during the early stage of unloading paths and increase of the confining effect of FRP jacket with the increase and decrease of the corner radius and aspect ratio respectively, a decrease in the slope of reloading branches with cycle repetitions and the independence of this trend from the variations of the aspect ratio and corner radius and also quadric relationship between the number of each cycle and the plastic strain of the same cycle as well as the independence of this relationship from the aspect ratio and corner radius.",

The use of individual activator was ineffective in producing AASB of sufficient fresh and hardened properties, compared to the synergy of both activators. This may be attributed to incomplete dissolution and condensation of oligomers required for gelation of the binder. An inverse relationship was noted among the fresh properties and the NH concentration or NS/NH ratio. This was influenced by the dissolution and condensation of silicate monomers under polymerization process. The maximum 28-day strength of ~45 MPa, setting time of 60 min and flow of 182 mm was obtained with the use of combined activators (10M-NH and NS/NH=2.5). The combined activators at NS/10M-NH=2.5 constituted SiO2/Na2O, H2O/Na2O and H2O/SiO2 molar ratio of 1.61, 17.33 and 10.77, respectively. This facilitated the formation of C-S-H, C/K-A-S-H and C-Mn-S-H in the framework together with an increase in the crystallinity due to more silicate re-organization within the aluminosilicate chain. On comparison of the high concentrated with mild alkali synthesized product, it revealed that the concentration of OHand Si monomers together with alkali metals influenced the dissolution of precursors and embedment of the constituent elements in the polymeric matrix. These factors eventually contributed to the microstructural densification of the mortar prepared with NS/10M-NH=2.5 thereby enhancing the compressive strength.",

One of the major problems is to preserve, maintain, and retrofit these structures. To meet the requirements of construction industry, the basic information on all the mechanical properties of various concretes is essential. This paper presents the details of development of various concretes, namely, normal strength concrete (around 50 MPa), high strength concrete (around 85 MPa) and ultra high strength concrete (UHSC) (around 120 MPa) including their mechanical properties. The various mechanical properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, fracture energy and tensile stress vs crack width have been obtained from the respective test results. It is observed from the studies that a higher value of compressive strength, split tensile strength and fracture energy is achieved in the case of UHSC, which can be attributed to the contribution at different scales viz., at the meso scale due to the fibers and at the micro scale due to the close packing of grains which is on account of good grading of the particles. Micro structure of UHSC mix has been examined for various magnifications to identify the pores if any present in the mix. Brief note on characteristic length and brittleness number has been given.",

    "abstract": "Today, pozzolans are widely used in construction for various reasons such as technical and economic efficiency. In this research, in order to evaluate some of important properties of concrete, silica fume and fly ash have been used as a replacement for cement in different mass percentages. Concrete mixtures were made from a water-cement ratio of (0.45) and cured under similar conditions. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the permeability and mechanical properties of concrete made from binary and ternary cementitious mixtures of fly ash and silica fume. In this study permeability of concrete was studied by evaluating the sorptivity, water absorption, water penetration depth, electrical resistivity and rapid chloride permeability (RCP) tests. Mechanical properties of concrete were evaluated with compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and modulus of elasticity. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the effects of silica fume and fly ash on the pore structure and morphology of concrete with cement based matrix. The results indicated that the incorporation of silica fume and fly ash increased the mechanical strength and improved the permeability of concrete.",

    "abstract": "While recognizing the problem of reinforcement corrosion and premature structural deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) structures as a combined effect of mechanical and environmental actions (carbonation, ingress of chlorides), emphasis is given on the effect of the latter, as most severe and unpredictable action. In this study, a simulation tool, based on proven predictive models utilizing principles of chemical and material engineering, for the estimation of concrete service life is applied on an existing reinforced concrete bridge (<TEX>${\\O}$</TEX>resund Link) located in a chloride environment. After a brief introduction to the structure of the models used, emphasis is given on the physicochemical processes in concrete leading to chloride induced corrosion of the embedded reinforcement. By taking under consideration the concrete, structural and environmental properties of the bridge investigated, an accurate prediction of its service life is taking place. It was observed that the proposed, and already used, relationship of service lifetime- cover is almost identical with a mean line between the lines derived from the minimum and maximum critical values considered for corrosion initiation. Thus, an excellent agreement with the project specifications is observed despite the different ways used to approach the problem. Furthermore, different scenarios of concrete cover failure, in the case when a coating is utilized, and extreme deicing salts attack are also investigated.",

The required input parameters for determining the double-K fracture parameters are derived from the developed fictitious crack model. It is found that the cohesive toughness and initial cracking toughness determined using weight function method and simplified equivalent cohesive force method agree well with those obtained using Gauss-Chebyshev integral method whereas these fracture parameters determined using simplified Green's function method deviates more than by 11% and 20% respectively as compared with those obtained using Gauss-Chebyshev integral method.

Sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide ratio of 1.0 and alkaline liquid to binder (AL/B) ratio of 0.60 is taken. Setting time, compressive, flexural strengths were studied up to the age of 90 days with different concentrations of NaOH. The microstructure of the hybrid geopolymer paste was studied by performing the SEM, EDS, and XRD on the broken samples. RHA based geopolymer paste blended with ultrafine slag resulted in high compressive and flexural strengths and increased setting times of the paste. Strength increased with the increase in NaOH concentration at all ages. The ultra-small particles of the slag acted as a micro-filler into the paste and enhanced the properties by improving the CASH, NASH, and CSH. The maximum compressive strength of 70MPa was achieved at 30% slag content with 16M NaOH. The results of XRD, SEM, and EDS at 30% replacement of RHA with ultra-fine slag densified the paste microstructure.",

    "abstract": "Application of nanotechnology can be used to tailor made cementitious composites owing to small dimension and physical behaviour of resulting hydration products. Because of high aspect ratio and extremely high strength, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are perfect reinforcing materials. Hence, there is a great prospect to use CNTs in developing new generation cementitious materials. In the present paper, a parametric study has been conducted on cementitious composites reinforced by two types of multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) designated as Type I CNT (10-20 nm outer dia.) and Type II CNT (30-50 nm outer dia.) with various concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 0.5% by weight of cement. To evaluate important properties such as flexural strength, strain to failure, elastic modulus and modulus of toughness of the CNT admixed specimens at different curing periods, flexural bending tests were performed. Results show that composites with Type II CNTs gave more strength as compared to Type I CNTs. The highest increase in strength (flexural and compressive) is of the order of 22% and 33%, respectively, compared to control samples. Modulus of toughness at 28 days showed highest improvement of 265% for Type II 0.3% CNT composites. It is obvious that an optimum percentage of CNT could exists for composites to achieve suitable reinforcement behaviour and desired strength properties. Based on the parametric study, a tentative optimum CNT concentration (0.3% by weight of cement) has been proposed. Scanning electron microscope image shows perfect crack bridging mechanism; several of the CNTs were shown to act as crack arrestors across fine cracks along with some CNTs breakage.",

Irregular structures, as a specific case, are more susceptible to sustain earthquake damage than regular structures. The study here is to identify damage states of vertically irregular structures using the well-recognized Park-Ang damage index. For doing this, a regular 3-story reinforced concrete (RC) structure is first designed based on ACI-318 code, and a peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 0.3 g. Some known vertical irregularities such as setback, short column and soft story are then applied to the regular structure. All the four structures are subjected to seven different earthquakes accelerations and different amplitudes which are then analyzed using nonlinear dynamic procedure. The damage indices of the structures are then accounted for using the pointed out damage index. The results show that the structure with soft story irregularity sustains more damage in all the earthquake records than the other structures. The least damage belongs the regular structure showing that different earthquake with different accelerations and amplitudes have no significant effect on the regular structures.",

Indeed, it consists in studying the effect of the sand type on the main properties of sand concrete: fracture and mechanical properties. We particularly insist on the determination of the fracture characteristics of this material which apparently have not been studied. To carry out this study, four different types of sand have been used: dune sand (DS), river sand (RS), crushed sand (CS) and river-dune sand (RDS). These sands differ in mineralogical nature, grain shape, angularity, particle size, proportion of fine elements, etc. The obtained results show that the particle size distribution of sand has marked its influence in all the studied properties of sand concrete since the sand having the highest diameter and the best particle size distribution has given the best fracture and mechanical properties. The grain shape, the angularity and the nature of sand have also marked their influence: thanks to its angularity and its limestone nature, crushed sand yielded good results compared to river and dune sands which are characterized by rounded shape and siliceous nature. Finally, it should further be noted that the sand concrete presents values of fracture and mechanical properties slightly lower than those of ordinary concrete. Compared to mortar, although the mechanical strength is lower, the fracture parameters are almost comparable. In all cases, the sand grains are debonded from the paste cement during the fracture which means that the crack goes through the paste-aggregate interface.",

For a\r\nwhole year, an Energy Plus thermal transfer model has been created and simulated. Simulations were made from the cities in five different areas of climate in China using weather data files. Energy savings were done from natural cold (e.g., outdoor air), and electricity reductions were performed from air-conditioning electricity devices. This research has investigated the relationship between the cost and building energy while finding a strong and positive correlation. This study has used the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) to\r\ncalculate the accurate measurement. Three regression models as Pearson correlation coefficient (r), root mean square (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) was used to calculate the results. Following the results of (R2) and RMSE, ELM has shown its higher performance in predicting the strength, energy, and cost of building materials. Based on the simulation results, for office buildings situated in cold areas, the energy savings resulting from phase change materials (PCM) are more prevalent. The test findings demonstrate that the energy savings from PCM applications for the cool area and hot summers and cold winter office buildings were increased. Simple payback time indicated that PCMBs in inhabited buildings could be used costeffectively in a mild temperature environment.",

A wire brush is used in order to increase the roughness of sample surfaces. The pulloff and slant shear tests have been adopted to assess the bonding strength between the test the old and new concrete. 30 cylindrical samples (7 cm diameter) have been examined by pull-off test, also slant shear test was conducted on 40 samples (10 cmx10 cmx30 cm). The obtained results showed that there is an active role for the bonding material as well as the surface roughness to increase the strength of adhesion between the old and new concrete.

As well, as a result of roughening the surface by brush, the strength of adhesion reaches 4% increase in the pull-off test and 23% in the slant shear test compared with the reference sample for each test, which demonstrates the importance of surface roughness to increase the bonding strength between the old and new concrete.",

Copper slag and ferrous slag are industrial by products obtained from the smelting process of copper and iron respectively. A large quantity of copper slag and ferrous slag end up being disposed as waste in landfills and this poses a serious threat to the environment.

This paper studies the technical feasibility of industrial by-products such as copper slag and ferrous slag to replace the fine aggregate in concrete by evaluating the workability, strength and durability characteristics of concrete. The test results indicate that the strength properties are not affected by 40% or 100% replacement of quarry sand with iron slag or copper slag.

However, the formulation of concrete material model is challenging and entails numerous input parameters that must be obtained through experimentation. This paper presents a damage scale analytical model to characterize concrete material for its pre- and post-peak behavior. To formulate the damage scale model, statistical regression and finite element analysis models were developed leveraging twenty existing experimental data sets on concrete compressive strength. Subsequently, the proposed damage scale analytical model was implemented in the finite element analysis simulation of a reinforced concrete pier subjected to vehicle impact loading and the response were compared to available field test data to validate its accuracy. Field test and FEA results were in good agreement. The proposed analytical model was able to reliably predict the concrete behavior including its post-peak softening in the descending branch of the stress-strain curve. The proposed model also resulted in drastic reduction of number of input parameters required for LS-DYNA concrete material models.",

C&D waste constitutes a major bulk of total solid waste produced in the world. In this work, an attempt is made to study the performance of concrete using water soaked Recycled Coarse Aggregates (RCA) in replacement levels of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% to Natural Coarse Aggregates (NCA). Experiments were designed and conducted to study the performance of RCA based concrete. Further suitable performance enhancement techniques to RCA based concrete were attempted, to achieve compressive strength at least equal to or more than that for no RCA based concrete (control concrete). Performance enhancement study is reported here for 50% and 100% RCA based concretes. All four techniques attempted have given favorable results encouraging use of RCA based concretes with full replacement levels, to adopt RCA based concrete in structural applications, without any kind of concern to the stake holder. Further attempts have also been made to use Recycled Fine Aggregates (RFA) with appropriate modifications to serve as fine aggregates in mortar and concrete. Using RFA blended with river sand fractions as well as RFA with Iron Ore Tailings (IOT) fractions, have given good results to serve as fine aggregates to the extent of 100% replacement levels in mortars and concretes.",

    "abstract": "In the present work, Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS) and Fly ash (FA) were used as partial replacement of\r\nNatural Sand (NS) and Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) by weight. One control mix, one with GBFS, three with FA and three with GBFS-FA combined mixes were prepared. Replacements were 50% GBFS with NS and 20%, 30% and 40% FAwith OPC. Preliminary investigation on development of compressive strength was carried out at 7, 28 and 90 days to ensure sustainability of waste materials in concrete matrix at room temperature. After 90days, thermo-mechanical study was performed on the specimen for a temperature regime of 200o-1000oC followed by furnace cooling. Weight loss, visual inspection along with colour change, residual compressive strength and microstructure analysis were performed to investigate the effect of replacement of GBFS and FA. Although adding waste mineral by-products enhanced the weight loss, their pozzolanicity and formation history at high temperature played a significant role in retaining higher residual compressive strength even up to 800oC. On detail microstructural study, it has been found that addition of FA and GBFS in concrete mix improved the density of concrete by development of extra calcium silicate gel before fire and restricts the development of micro-cracks at high temperature as well. In general, the authors are in favour of combined replacement mix in view of high volume mineral byproducts utilization as fire protection.",

Aggregates play a key role for changes in the fracture behaviour of concrete as they constitute about 60-75 % of the total volume of the concrete. The present study deals with the effect of size and quantity of coarse aggregate on the fracture behaviour of steel fibre reinforced self compacting concrete (SFRSCC). Lower\r\ncoarse aggregate and higher fine aggregate content in SCC results in the stronger interfacial transition zone and a weaker stiffness of concrete compared to vibrated concrete. As the fracture properties depend on the aggregates quantity and size particularly in SCC, three nominal sizes (20 mm, 16 mm and 12.5 mm) and three coarse to fine aggregate proportions (50-50, 45-55, 40-60) were chosen as parameters. Wedge Split Test (WST), a stable test method was adopted to arrive the requisite properties. Specimens without and with guide notch were investigated. The results are indicative of increase in fracture energy with increase in coarse aggregate size and quantity. The splitting force was maximum for specimens with 12.5 mm size which is associated with a brittle failure in the pre-ultimate stage followed by a ductile failure due to the presence of steel fibres in the post-peak stage.",

Fresh properties tests such as slump flow, T500, Vfunnel, J-ring, L-box, U-box, segregation resistance, bleeding, fresh density, and loss of slump flow (with time) were conducted. Compressive strength and percentage of permeable voids were evaluated in the hardened state. All the SCC mixtures exhibited sufficient flowability, passing ability, and resistance to segregation. Besides, all the binary blend SCC mixtures exhibited lower fresh density and bleeding, and better residual slump (up to 50% of GWA) compared to the OPC based control SCC mixture. Binary blend SCC mixture incorporating up to 40% GWA provided higher compressive strength than binary blend control SCC mixture.

The discarded waste glass has caused a series of problems such as resource waste and environmental pollution, so it is urgent to recycle waste glass with high replacement level. Glass powder (GP), as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM), used in cement-based materials has already become one of the important ways to recycle waste glass mainly attributed to its pozzolanic reaction and filling effect, especially to the suppressed ASR expansion. This paper demonstrates an overview of the properties of GP and its effect on the fresh and mechanical properties of cement-based materials. The study found that the influence of GP on the performance of cement-based materials mainly depends on its content, particle size, color and type, curing conditions, and other SCMs. Finally, based on the problems involved in the investigation of concrete containing GP, some corresponding suggestions and efforts are given to further guide the utilization of GP in cement-based materials.",

Four point loading scheme is selectively chosen. A model is developed to implement the material constitutive relationships and non-linearity. Five Slabs were modeled in FEM software using ABAQUS. One slab was unstrengthened control slab and the others were strengthened with steel plates with varying the plate thickness and configuration. In order to verify the accuracy of the numerical model, a comparison was done between the experimental results available in the literature and the proposed equations by ACI 318-11 for the calculation of ultimate load capacities of strengthened slabs, the agreement has proven to be good and FEA attained accurate results compared with ACI code. A parametric study was also carried out to investigate the influence of thickness of steel plate, strength of epoxy layer and type of strengthening plate on the performance of plated slabs. Also, the practical and technical feasibility of splitting the steel plate in strengthening process has been taken into account. For practical use, the author recommended to use bonded steel plate as one unit rather than splitting it to parts, because this saves more effort and reduces the risk of execution errors as in the case of multiple bonded parts. Both techniques have nearly the same effect upon the performance of strengthened slabs.",

    "abstract": "In the design of reinforced concrete structural walls, in order to ensure adequate inelastic displacement behaviour and to sustain deformation demands imposed by strong ground motions, special reinforcement is considered while designing. However, these would lead to severe reinforcement congestion and difficulties during construction. Addition of randomly distributed discrete fibres in concrete improves the flexural behaviour of structural elements because of its enhanced tensile properties and this leads to reduction in congestion. This paper deals with effect of addition of steel fibres on the behavior of high performance fibre reinforced cement concrete (HPFRCC) slender structural walls with the different volume fractions of steel fibres. The specimens were subjected to quasi static lateral reverse cyclic loading until failure. The high performance concrete (HPC) used was obtained based on the guidelines given in ACI 211.1 which was further modified by prof.Aitcin (1998). The volume fraction of the fibres used in this study varied from 0 to 1% with an increment of 0.5%. The results were analysed critically and appraised. The study indicates that the addition of steel fibres in the HPC structural walls enhances the first crack load, strength, initial stiffness and energy dissipation capacity.",

New generation polycarboxylate base water reducing admixture i.e., Cera Hyperplast XR-W40 was used in this study. The results of this research indicate that as w/b decreases, super plasticiser dose need to be increased so as to increase the workability of concrete. The effects of replacing cement by silpozz and RHA on the compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength were evaluated. The concrete mixture with different combination of silpozz and RHA gives higher strength as compared to control specimen for all w/b ratios and also observed that the early age strength of concrete is more as compared to the later age strength. It is also observed that the strength enhancement of concrete mixture prepared with the combination of cement, silpozz and RHA is higher as compared to the concrete mixture prepared with cement and silpozz or cement and RHA.",

    "abstract": "The following paper concentrates on the objective of studying the influences of extent of duration and temperature on the Pozzolanic properties as well as reactivity of locally existing natural clay of Nai Gaj, district Dadu, Sindh Pakistan. The activation of the clay only occurs through heating when temperature in a furnace chamber reaches 600, 700 and 800oC for 1, 2 and 3 hours and at 900 and 1000oC for 1 and 2 hours. Furthermore, the strength activity index (SAI) of advanced pozzolanic material happens to be identified through 20% cement replacement for different samples of calcined clay as per ASTM C-618. The compressive strength test of samples had been operated for 7 and 28-days curing afterwards. The maximum compressive strength had been seen in mix E in which cement was replaced with clay calcined at 700oC for 1 hour that is 27.05 MPa that is 24.31% more than that of control mix. The results gathered from the SAI verdicts the optimal activation temperature is 700oC within a one-hour time period. The SAI at a temperature of 700oC with a one-hour duration at 28 days is 124.31% which happens to satisfy the requirements of the new Pozzolanic material, in order to be applied in mortar/concrete (i.e., 75%). The\r\nEnergy- dispersive spectrometry (EDS) along with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been carried out in means of verifying whether there is silica content or amorphous silica present in metakaolin that has been developed. The findings gathered from the SAI were validated, as the analysis of XRD verified that there is in fact Pozzolanic activity of developed metakaolin. Additionally, based on observation, the activated metakaolin holds a significant influence on the increase in mortar's compressive strength.",

    "abstract": "This study was focused on the use of partial replacement of cement with glass powder in high strength concrete and also copper slag as a partial replacement of coarse sand in concrete. The high strength concrete was prepared with different mineral admixtures like silica fume, fly ash and rice ash husk in different proportions. An experimental investigation has been carried to study about the effect of glass powder on high strength copper slag concrete. The range of glass powder was 10%, 15% and 20% as a replacement of cement. The range of copper slag was 0%, 20%, 40% and 60% as a replacement of natural sand. In addition to the different percentage of fly ash, silica fume, and rice husk ash 5% and 10% was also studied in copper slag concrete. Thus, a total of 51 cubes were casted and compressive strength test was performed on them. The result of the study shows that the value of average compressive strength of concrete after addition of 10%, 15% and 20% of glass powder are 70.47, 72.01 and 73.31 respectively. The value of average compressive strength after addition of 20%, 40% and 60% copper slag as a replacement of sand are 72.18, 74.38 and 73.08 respectively. The value of average compressive strength after addition of 5% and 10% fly ash as a replacement of cement are 71.56 and 73.22. The value of average compressive strength after addition of 5% and 10% silica fume as a replacement of cement are 72.33 and 73.53. The value of average compressive strength after addition of 5% and 10% rice husk ash as a replacement of cement are 72.86 and 69.49. At the level of 20% replacement of cement by glass powder meets maximum strength as compared to that of controlled concrete and copper slag high strength concrete.",

    "abstract": "A variety of polycarboxylate ether (PCE)-based superplasticizers are commercially available. Their influence on the rheological retention and slump loss in respect of concrete differ considerably. Fluidity and slump loss are the cardinal features responsible for the quality of concrete. These are related to the dispersion of cement particles and the hydration process which are greatly influenced by type of polycarboxylate ether (PCE)-based superplasticizers. On the backdrop of relatively less studies in the context of rheological retention of high strength self-consolidating concrete (HS-SCC), the experimental investigations were carried out aiming at quantifying the effect of the six different PCE polymers (PCE 1-6) on the rheological retention of HS-SCC mixes containing two types of Ordinary Portland Cements (OPC) and unwashed crushed sand as the fine aggregate. The tests that were carried out included T500, V-Funnel, yield stress and viscosity retention tests. The supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash (FA) and micro-silica (MS) were also used in ternary blend keeping the mix paste volume and flow of concrete constant. Low water to binder ratio was used. The results reveal that not only the PCEs of different polymer groups behave differently, but even the PCEs of same polymer groups also behave differently. The study also indicates that the HS-SCC mixes containing PCE 6 and PCE 5 performed better as compared to the mixes containing PCE 1, PCE 2, PCE 3 and PCE 4 in respect of all the rheological tests. The PCE 6 is a new class of chemical admixtures known as Polyaryl Ether (PAE) developed by BASF to provide better rheological properties in even in HS-SCC mixes at low water to binder mix. In the present study, the PCE 6, is found to help not only in reduction in the plastic viscosity and yield stress, but also provide good rheological retention over the period of 180 minutes. Further, the early compressive strength properties (one day compressive strength) highly depend on the type of PCE polymer. The side chain length of PCE polymer and the fineness of the cement considerably affect the early strength gain.",

    "abstract": "The rich recipe of ultra high performance concrete (UHPC) offers the higher mechanical, durability and dense microstructure property. The variable like cement/sand ratio, amount of supplementary cementitious material, water/binder ratio, amount of fiber etc. alters the UHPC hardened properties to any extent. Therefore, to understand the effects of these variables on the performance of UHPC, inevitably a stage-wise development is required. In the present experimental study, the effect of sand/cement ratio, the addition of finer material (fly ash and quartz powder) and, hybrid fiber on the fresh, compressive and microstructural property of UHPC is evaluated. The experiment is conducted in three phases; the first phase evaluates the flow value and strength attainment of ingredients, the second phase evaluates the efficiency of finer materials (fly ash and quartz powder) to develop the UHPC and the third phase evaluate the effect of hybrid fiber on the flow value and strength of ultra high performance hybrid fiber reinforced concrete (UHP-HFRC). It has been seen that the addition of fly ash improves the flow value and compressive strength of UHPC as compared to quartz powder. Further, the usage of hybrid fiber in fly ash contained matrix decreases the flow value and improves the strength of the UHP-HFRC matrix. The dense interface between matrix and fiber and, a higher amount of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) in fly ash contained UHP-HFRC is revealed by SEM and XRD respectively. The dense interface (bond between the fiber and the UHPC matrix) and the higher CSH formation are the reason for the improvement in the compressive strength of fly ash based UHP-HFRC. The differential thermal analysis (DTA/TGA) shows the similar type of mass loss pattern, however, the amount of mass loss differs in fly ash and quartz powder contained UHP-HFRC.",

    "abstract": "The applicability of limit analysis methods in design and assessment of concrete structures generally requires a certain plastic deformation capacity. The latter is primarily provided by the ductility of the reinforcement, being additionally affected by the bond properties between reinforcing steel and concrete since they provoke strain localization in the reinforcement at cracks. The bond strength of reinforcing bars is not only governed by concrete quality, but also by construction details such as bar ribbing, bar spacing or concrete cover thickness. For new concrete structures, a potentially unfavorable impact on bond strength can easily be anticipated through appropriate code rules on construction details. In existing structures, these requirements may not be necessarily satisfied, consequently requiring additional considerations. This two-part paper investigates in a theoretical study the impacts of the most frequently encountered construction details which may not satisfy design code requirements on bond strength, steel strain localization and plastic deformation capacity of cracked structural concrete. The first part introduces basic considerations on bond, strain localization and plastic deformation capacity as well as the fundamentals of the Tension Chord Model underlying the further investigations. It also analyzes the impacts of the hardening behavior of reinforcing steel and concrete quality. The second part discusses the impacts of construction details (bar ribbing, bar spacing, and concrete cover thickness) and of additional structure-specific features such as bar diameter and crack spacing.",

    "abstract": "The attack of environmental aggressive agents progressively reduces the structural reliability of buildings and infrastructures and, in the worst exposition conditions, may even lead to their collapse in the long period. A change in the material and sectional characteristics of a structural element, due to the environmental damaging effects, changes its mechanical behaviour and varies both the internal stress redistribution and the kinematics through which it reaches its ultimate state. To identify such a behaviour, the evolution of both the damaging process and its mechanical consequences have to be taken into account. This paper presents a computational approach for the analysis of reinforced and prestressed concrete elements under sustained loading conditions and subjected to given damaging scenarios. The effects of the diffusion of aggressive agents, of the onset and development of the corrosion state in the reinforcement and the corresponding mechanical response are studied. As known, the corrosion on the reinforcing bars influences the damaging rate in the cracking pattern evolution; hence, the damage development and the mechanical behaviours are considered as coupled phenomena.\r\nThe reliability of such an approach is validated in modelling the diffusion of the aggressive agents and the changes in the mechanical response of simple structural elements whose experimental behaviour is reported in Literature.\r\nA second set of analyses studies the effects of the corrosion of the tendons of a P.C. beam and explores potentially unexpected structural responses caused by corrosion under different aggressive exposition. The role of the different types and of the different positions of the damaging agents is discussed. In particular, it is shown how the collapse mode of the beam may switch from flexural to shear type, in case corrosion is caused by a localized chloride attack in the shear span.",

In this work, physical and chemical characterization of recycled polycarbonate from electronic waste was made, through the analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Then cement concrete was made with Portland cement, sand, gravel, water, and this recycled polycarbonate. Specimens without polycarbonate were produced for comparison purposes. The effect of the particle sizes and concentrations of recycled polycarbonate within the concrete, on the compressive strength and density was studied. Results show that compressive strength values and equilibrium density of concrete depend on the polycarbonate particle sizes and its concentrations; particularly the highest compressive strength values were 20% higher than that for concrete without polycarbonate particles. Moreover, morphological, structural and crystallinity characteristics of recycled polycarbonate, are suitable for to be mixed into concrete.",

Rice husk was incinerated at 800oC in a hot air oven. and ground in a ball mill to achieve the required fineness. RHA was partially added in 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 percentages to fly ash with 10% of GGBS to produce geopolymer concrete. Test results exhibit that the substitution of RHA in geopolymer concrete resulted in reduced strength properties during initial curing. In the initial stage, workability of GPC mixes was affected by RHA particles due to the presence of dormant particles in it. It is evident from the\r\nmicrostructural study that the presence of RHA particles densifies the matrix reducing porosity in concrete. This is due to the presence of RHA in geopolymer concrete, which affects the ratio of silica and alumina, resulting in polycondensation reactions products. This study suggests that incorporation of rice husk ash in geopolymer concrete is the solution for effective utilization of waste materials and prevention of environmental pollution due to the dumping of industrial waste and to produce eco-friendly concrete.",

Especially considering on critical importance against blastingthreats and environmental safety, dams have to be examined according to the blast loads. This paper aims to investigate structural response of concrete gravity dams under blast loads. For the purpose Sariyar Concrete Gravity Dam in Turkey is selected for numerical application with its 85 m of reservoir height (H), 255 m of reservoir length (3H), 72 m of bottom and 7 mof top widths. In the study, firstly 3D finite element model of the dam is constituted using ANSYS Workbench software considering dam-reservoir-foundation interaction and a hydrostatic analysis is performed without blast loads. Then, nearly 13 tons TNT explosive are considered 20 m away from downstream of the dam and this is modeled using ANSYS AUTODYN software. After that explicit analyses are performed through 40 milliseconds. Lastly peak pressures obtained from analyses arecompared to empirical equations in the literature and UFC 3-340-02 standard which provide unified facilities criteria for structures to resist the effects of accidental explosions. Also analyses' results such as displacements, stresses and strains obtained from both hydrostatic and blasting analysis models are compared to each other. It is highlighted from the study that blasting analysis model has more effective than the only hydrostatic analysis model. So it is highlighted from the study that the design of dams should be included the blast loads.",

Furthermore, waste plastic and waste rubber has been especially studied in this review. Although concretes containing PET fibre revealed a reduction in compressive strength at low fibre fractions, using PET is resulted to micro-cracking decrement and increasing flexibility and flexural strength. Finally, according to the reviews, the conventional waste fibres are well-suited to mitigated time-induced damages of concrete and waste fibres and aggregates could be a reliable replacement for concrete.",

These shells are stiffened by rings in the tangential direction. For isotropic materials, the physical properties are same everywhere where the laminated and functionally graded materials, they vary from point to point. Here the shell material has been taken as functionally graded material. The influence of the ring supports is investigated at various positions. These variations have been plotted against the locations of ring supports for three values of length-to-diameter ratios. Effect of ring supports with middle layer thickness is presented using the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure with three different conditions. The influence of the positions of ring supports for clamped-clamped is more visible\r\nthan simply supported and clamped-free end conditions.

Due to the reduction of natural non-renewable mineral resources, powder minerals with similar properties are considered as new mineral fillers in asphalt mixtures. This study explored the feasibility of using cement to replace natural limestone powder (LP) in emulsified asphalt concrete modified by styrene-butadiene styrene copolymer. The experimental tests, including compressive strength, Marshall stability as well as moisture susceptibility test, were used to investigate the mechanical properties, the Marshall stability, flow value, as well as the moisture damage. In addition, the influence of material composition on the performance of asphalt concrete is explained by the microstructure evolution of the pore structure, the interface transition zone (ITZ), and the micromorphology. Due to mineralogical reactivity of cement, its replacement part of LP improved the mechanical properties, Marshall stability, but it will reduce the moisture susceptibility and flow value. This is because with the increase of the cement substitution rate, the pore structure of the asphalt concrete is refined, the width of ITZ becomes smaller, and the microstructure is more compact. In addition, asphalt concrete with a larger nominal\r\nparticle size (AC-16) has relatively better performance.",

Many homogenization-based approaches have been proposed to deal with heterogeneous materials in the last years. In this context, a computational homogenization modeling for concrete is presented in this work using the concept of Representative Volume Element (RVE). The material is considered as a three-phase material consisting of interface zone (ITZ), matrix and inclusions-each constituent modeled by an independent constitutive model. The Representative Volume Element (RVE) consists of inclusions idealized as circular shapes symmetrically and non-symmetrically placed into the specimen. The interface zone is modeled by means of cohesive contact finite elements. The inclusion is modeled as linear elastic and matrix region is considered as elastoplastic material. A set of examples is presented in order to show the potentialities and limitations of the proposed modeling. The consideration of the fracture processes in the ITZ is fundamental to capture complex macroscopic characteristics of the material using simple constitutive models at mesoscopic level.",

    "abstract": "The present work investigates about the development of a novel construction material by utilizing Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBS), an industrial waste product, as substitution of natural fine aggregates. For this, experimental work has been carried out to determine the influence of GBS on the properties of concrete such as compressive strength (CS), modulus of elasticity, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), chloride penetration, water absorption (WA) volume of voids (VV) and density. Concrete mixes of water/cement (w/c) ratios 0.45 and 0.5, and incorporating 20%, 40% and 60% of GBS as partial replacement of natural fine aggregate (sand) are designed for this study. The results of the experimental investigation depict that CS of concrete mixes increases with the increasing percentages of GBS. Moreover, the decrease in chloride penetration, WA and VV, and improvement in the modulus of elasticity, UPV, density of concrete is reported with the increasing percentage of GBS in concrete.",

    "abstract": "China accounts for nearly half of the global steel production. As a waste material or a by-product in the manufacture process, a large amount of blast furnace slag is generated every year. The majority of recycled blast furnace slag is used as an additive in low-grade blended cement in China (equivalent to the UK CEM II or CEM III depending on the slag content). The cost of using ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) in such low-grade applications may not be entirely reimbursed based on market research. This paper reports an on-going project at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) which investigates the feasibility of using GGBS in long-span concrete structures by avoiding/reducing the use of crack control reinforcement. Based on a case study investigation, with up to 50% of CEM I cement replaced with GGBS, a beneficiary effect of reduced thermal contraction is achieved in long-span concrete slabs with no significant detrimental effect on early-age strengths. It is believed that this finding may be transferable from China to other Asian countries with similar climates and economic/environmental concerns.",

    "abstract": "Mortar is a masonry product which is matrix of concrete. It consists of binder and fine aggregate and moreover, it is an essential associate in any reinforced structural construction. The strength of mortar is a special concern to the engineer because mortar is responsible to give protection in the outer part of the structure as well as at a brick joint in masonry wall system. The purpose of this research is to investigate the compressive strength and tensile strength of mortar, which are important mechanical properties, by replacing the cement and sand by stone dust. Moreover, to minimize the increasing demand of cement and sand, checking of appropriateness of stone dust as a construction material is necessary to ensure both solid waste minimization and recovery by exchanging stone dust with cement and sand. Stone dust passing by No. 200 sieve, is used as cement replacing material and retained by No. 100 sieve is used for sand replacement. Sand was replaced by stone dust of 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% and 50% by weight of sand while cement was replaced by stone dust of 3%, 5%, and 7% by weight of cement. Test result indicates that, compressive strength of specimen mix with 35% of sand replacing stone dust and 3% of cement replacing stone dust increases 21.33% and 22.76% respectively than the normal mortar specimen at 7 and 28 days while for tensile it increases up to 13.47%. At the end, optimum dose was selected and crack analysis as well as discussion also included.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a case study about the damages on the structural elements of a cast in place reinforced concrete (RC) building after a big fire which was able to be controlled after six hours. The fire broke off at the 2nd basement floor of the building, which has five basements, one ground, and two normal floors. As a result of intensely stocked ignitable materials, it spread out to the all of the upstairs. In visual inspection, most of the typical fire damages were observed (such as spalling, net-like cracks, crumbled plasters, bared or visible reinforcement). Also, failures of the 2nd basement columns were encountered. It has been concluded that the severity failures of the columns at the 2nd basement caused utterly deformation of the building, which is responsible for the massive damages on the beam-column connections. All of the observed damages were categorized related to the types and presented separated regarding the floors. Besides to the visual inspection, the numerical analysis was run to verify the observed damaged on the building for columns, beams, and the connection regions. It is concluded from the study that several parameters such as duration of the fire, level of the temperature influence on the damages to the RC building. Also, it is highlighted by the study that if the damaged building is considered on the overall structural system, it is not able to satisfy the minimum service requirements neither gravity loads nor earthquake conditions.",

In previous years, before computer analysis programs, the parameters of blast effects were calculated with empirical methods, consequently some researchers had proposed equations to find out the phenomenon. In recent year\\'s computer analysis programs have developed already, so detailed solutions can be made numerically. This paper describes the blasting response of the structures using numerical and empirical methods. For the purpose, a reinforced concrete retaining wall is modelled using ANSYS Workbench software, and the model is imported to ANSYS AUTODYN software to perform explicit analyses. In AUTDYN software, a sum of TNT explosive is defined 5,5 m away from the wall and solution is done. Numerical results are compared with those of obtained from empirical equations. Similar study is also considered for equal explosive which is the 4 m away from the wall. The results are represented by graphics and contour diagrams of such as displacements and pressures. The results showed that distance of explosive away from the wall is highly affected the structural response of it.",

The purpose of this shaking table experiment sequence is to assess local behavior and progressive collapse mechanism. Frequency decrease and eigen-vector evolution are directly related to in-plane and out-of-plane bearing capacities of infill wall enclosure with reinforced concrete frame. Firstly, frequency decrease-damage relationship was evaluated on the base of experiment results. Then, frequency decrease and stiffness degradation were evaluated with applied Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) by considering strength deterioration. Lastly, eigenvector evolution-local damage and eigenvector evolution-frequency decrease relationship was investigated. Five modes were considered while evaluating damage and frequency decrease of the tested specimens. The relationship between frequency decrease, stiffness degradation and damage level were presented while comparing with Unreinforced Brick Infill (URB) and Reinforced Infill wall with Bed Joint Reinforcement (BJR) on the base of natural vibration\r\nfrequency.",

Dynamic equilibrium equations of motions obtained from the finite element models of the coupled systems are solved by using Newmark time integration algorithm. The seismic response of the models is evaluated from analyses presenting natural frequencies, mode shapes, displacements and principal stresses. The results show that the L/H ratios considerably affect the seismic response of gravity dams. Also, the model where L/H ratio is 1.00 has more desirable results and most appropriate representation of the seismic response of gravity dams.",

In the experimental study, RPW was used for replacing river sand and manufactured sand (M sand) aggregates in concrete. The replacement level of fine aggregates was ranging from 5% to 20% by volume with an increment of 5%. M40 grade of concrete with water cement ratio of 0.40 was used in this study. Two different types of RPW were used, and they are (i) un-activated RPW and (ii) activated RPW. The activated RPW was obtained by alkali activation of un-activated RPW using NaOH solution. The hardened properties of the concrete determined were dry density, compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). The properties of the concrete with river sand, M sand, activated RPW and un-activated RPW were compared and inferences were drawn. The effect of activation using NaOH solution was investigated using FT-IR study. The micro structural examination of hardened concrete was carried out using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The test results show that the strength of concrete with activated RPW was more than that of un-activated RPW. From the results, it is evident that it is feasible to use 5% un-activated RPW and 15% activated RPW as fine aggregates for making concrete without affecting the strength properties.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an experimental study was conducted on the compressive behavior of steel tube confined concrete (STCC) and concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) columns with active and passive confinement. To create active confinement in the STCC and CFST specimens, an innovative method was used in this study, in which by applying pressure on the fresh concrete, the steel tube was laterally pretensioned and the concrete core was compressed simultaneously. Of the benefits of this technique are improving the composite column behavior, without the use of additives and without the need for vibration, and achieving high prestressing levels. To achieve lower and higher prestressing levels, short and long term pressures were applied to the specimens, respectively. Nineteen STCC and CFST specimens in three groups of passive, short-term active, and longterm active confinement were subjected to axial compression, and their mechanical properties including the compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and axial strain were evaluated. The results showed that the proposed method of prestressing the STCC columns led to a significant increase in the compressive strength (about 60%), initial modulus of elasticity (about 130%) as well as a significant reduction in the axial strain (about 45%). In the CFST columns, the prestressing led to a considerable increase in the compressive strength, a small effect on the initial and secant modulus of elasticity and an increase in the axial strain (about 55%). Moreover, increased prestressing levels negligibly affected the compressive strength of STCCs and CFSTs but slightly increased the elastic modulus of STCCs and significantly decreased that of CFSTs.",

A number of standardized test methods were developed to assess these properties. However, no accelerated test method reliably predicts both workability and static stability of SCC. In the present work, a modified K-slump test method was developed to evaluate workability and static stability of SCC. In order to take implicit mixture variations of SCC constituents that can affect fresh SCC properties, a central composite design was adopted to highlight the effect of gravel to sand ratio (G/S), gravel 3/8 to gravel 8/15 ratio (G1/G2), water to cement ratio (W/C), marble powder to cement ratio (MP/C) and superplasticizer content (SP) on workability measured with slump and flow time (T50) tests and static stability measured with sieve stability test (Pi), segregation test index (SSI), Penetration test (Pd) and the proposed K-slump test (Km). The obtained results show that G/S ratio close to 1 and G1/G2 ratio close to 60% can be considered as optimal values to achieve a good workability while ensuring a sufficient static stability of SCC. Acceptable\r\nrelationships were obtained between Slump flow, Pi, Pd and Km.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effect of recycled glass powder (RGP) on flowing properties of self-compacting mortars (SCMs) containing different ratios of fillers and superplasticizer dosages. Fly ash (FA), nano-silica (NS), micro-silica (MS), metakaolin (MK) and rice husk ash (RHA) are used as fillers and their synergistic effect with RFP is studied. The effects of fillers and high-range water reducer (HRWR) on flowing ability of mortars are primarily determined by slump flow and Vfunnel flow time tests. The results showed that for composites with a higher RGP content, the mortar flowing ability increased but tended to decrease when the composites containing 10% MK or 5% RHA. However, the flowing ability of samples incorporating 5% RGP and 10% SF or 25% FA showed an opposite result that their slump flow spread decreased and then increased with increasing RGP content. For specimens with 3% NS, the influence of RGP content on flowing properties was not significant. Except RHA and MS, the fillers studied in this paper could reduce the dosage of HRWR required for achieving the same followability. Also, the mixture parameters were determined and indicated that the flowability of mixtures was also affected by the content of sand and specific surface area of cement materials. It is believed that excess fine particles provided ball-bearing effect, which could facilitate the movement of coarse particles and alleviate the interlocking action among particles. Also, it can be concluded that using fillers in conjunction with RGP as cementitious materials can reduce the material costs of SCM significantly.",

The effect of curing environment and the initial water curing period on the properties and behavior of SCC such as compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and sorptivity of the SCC specimens were investigated. Three Water/Binder (W/B) ratios (0.32, 0.38 and 0.44) have been used to obtain three ranges of compressive strength. Five curing methods have been applied on the SCC by varying the duration and the conservation condition of SCC. The results obtained on the compressive strength show that the period of initial water curing of seven days followed by maturation in the hot climate is better in comparison with the four other curing methods. The coefficient of sorptivity is influenced by W/B ratio and the curing methods. It is also shown that the sorptivity coefficient of SCC specimens is very sensitive to the curing condition. The SCC specimens cured in water present a low coefficient of sorptivity regardless of the ratio W/B. Furthermore, the results show that there is a good correlation between ultrasonic pulse velocity and the compressive strength.",

In recent times, Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites have substituted the conventional techniques of retrofitting and strengthening of damaged concrete. Most of the research studies related to concrete strengthening using FRP have been performed on undamaged test specimens. This contribution presents the results of an experimental study in which concrete specimens were damaged by mechanical loading and elevated temperature in laboratory prior to application of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) sheets for strengthening. The test specimens prepared using concrete of target compressive strength of 28 MPa at 28 days were subjected to compressive and splitting tensile testing up to failure and the intact pieces of the failed specimens were collected for the purpose of repair. In order to induce damage as a result of elevated temperature, the concrete cylinders were subjected to 400oC and 800",

This study investigates the effectiveness of four different strengthening techniques representing the local and global modifications to improve the seismic performance of a non-ductile RC OGS frame. Steel caging and concrete jacketing methods of column strengthening are considered as the local modification techniques, whereas steel bracing and RC shear wall systems are selected as the global strengthening techniques in this study. Performance-based plastic design (PBPD) approach relying on energy-balance concept has been adopted to determine the required design force demand on the strengthening elements. Nonlinear static and dynamic analyses are carried out on the numerical models of study frames to assess the effectiveness of selected strengthening techniques in improving the seismic performance of OGS frame.. Strengthening techniques based on steel braces and RC shear wall significantly reduced the peak interstory drift response of the OGS frame. However, the peak floor acceleration of these strengthened frames is amplified by more than 2.5 times as compared to that of unstrengthened frame. Steel caging technique of column strengthening resulted in a reasonable reduction in the peak interstory drift response without substantial amplification in peak floor acceleration of the OSG frame.",

This results in a modification of some properties, namely mortar workability, mechanical strength and durability. Three superplasticizers were used; a polynaphthalenesulfonate (PNS), a melamine resin (PMS) and a polycarboxylate (PC). They have been incorporated into various amount in a standardized mortar based on limestone cement. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rheological, mechanical and Calorimeters properties of this mortar. This will select the most compatible product and more able to be used depending on the climate of the country and the cement used. The PNS is incompatible with this type of cement registering a decrease of strength but the PMS and the PC modify the kinetics of hydration with significant heat generation and improved mechanical strength. The measured heat flow is significantly influenced by the type and dosage of superplasticizer especially for low dosage. Hydration heat and compressive strength of the different mixtures can be evaluated by determining their ultimate values and ages to reach these values where the correlation coefficients are very satisfactory.",

There is still a lack of knowledge of the seismic behavior and performance of the precast pile foundation. In this study, a 1/8 scaled model of precast pile foundation with elevated cap is fabricated for quasi-static test. The failure mechanism and responses of the precast pile-soil interaction system are analyzed. It is shown that damage occurs primarily in precast pile-soil interaction system and the bridge pier keeps elastic state because of its relatively large cross-section designed for railways. The vulnerable part of the precast pile with elevated cap is located at the embedded section, but no plastic hinge forms along the pile depth under cyclic loading. Hysteretic curves show no significant strength degradation but obvious stiffness degradation throughout\r\nthe loading process. The energy dissipation capacity of the precast pile-soil interaction system is discussed by using index of the equivalent viscous damping ratio. It can be found that the energy dissipation capacity decreases with the increase of loading displacement due to the unyielding pile reinforcements and potential pile uplift. It is expected to promote the use of precast pile foundation in accelerated bridge construction (ABC) of railways designed in seismic regions.",

Five series of RHA geopolymer specimens were prepared by varying the Si/Al ratio as 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5. The paper focuses on the correlation of microstructure with hardened state parameters like bulk density, apparent porosity, sorptivity, water absorption and compressive strength. XRD analysis peaks indicates quartz, cristobalite and gibbsite for raw RHA and new peaks corresponding to Zeolite A in geopolymer specimens. In general, SEM micrographs show interconnected pores and loosely packed geopolymer matrix except for specimens made with Si/Al of 2.0 which exhibited comparatively better matrix. Incorporation of Al from sodium aluminate were confirmed with the stretching and bending vibration of Si-O-Si and O-Si-O observations from the FTIR analysis of geopolymer specimen. The dense microstructure of SA2.0 correlate into better performance in terms of 28 days maximum compressive strength of 16.96 MPa and minimum for porosity, absorption and sorptivity among the specimens. However, due to the higher water demand to make the paste workable, the value of porosity, absorption and sorptivity were reportedly higher as compared with other geopolymer systems. Correlation regression equations were proposed to validate the interrelation between physical parameters and mechanical strength. RHA geopolymer shows comparatively lower compressive strength as compared to Fly ash geopolymer.",

To promote the use of AAB in construction activities, a practically implementable mix proportion is required. Owing to the several raw ingredients of AAB concrete and their associated uncertainties, partial replacement of PC by AAB may be adopted instead of complete replacement as per industrial requirements. Hence, the present study aims to determine an optimal proportion for partial replacement of PC with AAB and recommend a technique for it based on site conditions. Three modes of partial replacement are followed: combining all the dry ingredients for AAB and PC followed by the addition of the requisite liquids (PAM); combining the PC and the AAB concrete in two horizontal layers (PAH); and two vertical layers (PAV). 28-day old specimens are exposed to 10% v/v solutions of HCl, H2SO4, and HNO3 to evaluate changes in mechanical, physical, and microstructural characteristics through compressive strength, corrosion depth, and microscopy. Based on deterioration in strength and integrity, PAH or PAV can be adopted in absence of acid attack, whereas PAM is recommended in presence of acid attack.",

    "abstract": "Metakaolin, a dehydroxylated product of the mineral kaolinite, is one of the most valuable admixtures for high-performance concrete applications, including constructing reinforced concrete bridges and impact- and fire-resistant structures. Concretes produced using metakaolin become more homogeneous and denser compared to normal-strength concrete. Yet, these changes cause a change of volume throughout hardening, and increase the brittleness of hardened concrete significantly. In order to examine how the use of metakaolin affects the fracture and mechanical behavior of high-performance concrete we produced concretes using a range of water to binder ratio (0.42, 0.35 and 0.28) at three different weight fractions of metakaolin replacement (8%, 16% and 24%). The results showed that the rigidity of concretes increased with using 8% and 16% metakaolin, while it decreased in all series with 24% of metakaolin replacement. Similar effect has also been observed for other mechanical properties. While the peak loads in load-displacement curves of concretes decreased significantly with increasing water to binder ratio, this effect have been found to be diminished by using metakaolin. Pore structure analysis through mercury intrusion porosimetry test showed that the addition of metakaolin decreased the critical pore size of paste phases of concrete, and increasing the amount of metakaolin reduced the total porosity for the specimens with low water to binder ratios in particular. To determine the optimal values of water to binder ratio and metakaolin content in producing high-strength and high-performance concrete we applied a multi-objective optimization, where several responses were simultaneously assessed to find the best solution for each parameter.",

Seven mixes were proportioned and cast without vibration in long beams with 10 mm and 16 mm steel dowels fixed vertically along the flowing path. The beams were then broken into discrete test specimens. A push-put configuration was adopted for conducting the bond test. The variation of the ultimate bond strength along the flowing path for the different mixes was evaluated. The steel-concrete bond adequacy was evaluated based on normalized bond strength. The results showed that the bond strength was reduced due to Portland cement replacement with dolomite powder. The addition of either silica fume or fly ash positively hindered further degradation as the dolomite powder content increased. However, all SCC mixes containing up to 30% dolomite powder still yielded bond strengths that were adequate for design purpose.

The interaction of SCMs with OPC influenced the hydration products, resulting to the formation of ettringite and monocarboaluminate phases. The blended cement paste also showed extensive calcium silicate hydrates and calcium aluminate silicate hydrates but unrefined compared to plain cement paste. In overall, the expected synergistic reaction was significantly hindered due to the low quality of supplementary cementitious materials used.

Experimental test results indicated that using forging process as new bar splicing method can have high effects on increasing ductility and energy dissipation of concrete structures. It also proved that this method increased the flexural rigidity, energy absorption, and ductility of the RC beams. And also this research results showed that the flexural capacity and ductility of the beam with 50% forging were respectively increased up to 10% and 75% comparing to that of reference specimen, but the energy absorption of this beams was decreased up to 27%. The ductility of beam with 50% forging was increased up to 25% comparing the ductility of beam with\r\n100% forging.",

We altered the component materials (binder type, water-binder (W/B) ratio, sand ratio) to assess their effect on the rheological properties experimentally. The results indicated that the W/B and sand ratios had the largest effect on the rheological properties. In particular, when the sand ratio increased, it indicated that\r\nadjusting the sand ratio would facilitate control over the rheological properties. Additionally, we compared the rheological properties with the results of a traditional workability evaluation, namely the table flow test. This indicated the possibility of inferring the rheological properties by using traditional methods. Finally, we evaluated extrusion quantity according to table flow. The extrusion rate was 350 g/s for a flow of 210 mm and 170 g/s for a flow of 130 mm, indicating that extrusion rate\r\nincreased as flow increased; however, we concluded that a flow standard of approximately 140-160 mm is suitable for\r\ncontrolling the actual extrusion quantity and rate.",

The results show that the compressive strength and the flexural strength of PCPC decrease with the increase of porosity. The permeability coefficient and the wear loss of PCPC increase with the increase of the porosity. The compressive strength and the flexural strength of PCPC subjected to 25 freeze-thaw cycles are reduced by 13.7%-17.8% and 10.6%-18.3%, respectively. For PCPC subjected to the same freeze-thaw cycles, the mass loss firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of the porosity.

Developing a probabilistic demand model requires a reliable database that is established in this paper by performing incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) under a set of 20 ground motion records. Next, by employing Bayesian statistical inference drift demand models are developed based on pre-collapse data obtained from IDA. Then, the accuracy and reasonability of the developed models are investigated by plotting diagnosis graphs. This graphical analysis demonstrates probabilistic demand model developed in terms of PGA is more reliable. Afterward, fragility curves according to PGA based-demand model are developed.",

A limited number of studies have been reported in the literature on the strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) beams with basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP). The present experimental work explores the feasibility of using the BFRP strips for shear strengthening of the RC beams. The strengthening schemes include full wrap and U-wrap. A simple mechanical anchorage scheme has been introduced to prevent the debonding of U-wrap as well as to utilize the full capacity of the BFRP composite. The effect of varying shear span-to-effective depth (a/d) ratio on the behavior of shear deficient RC beams strengthened with BFRP strips under different schemes is examined. The RC beams were tested under a four-point loading system. The study finds that the beams strengthened with and without BFRP strips fails in shear for a/d ratio 2.5 and the enhancement of the shear capacity of strengthened beams ranges from 5% to 20%. However, the strengthened beams fail in flexure, and the control beam fails in shear for a higher a/d ratio, i.e., 3.5. The experimental results of the present study have been compared with the analytical study and found that the latter gives conservative results.",

Damage and fragility analyses of the frame subjected to 204 pulse-type motions were then performed using a selected damage model and inter-storey drifts. The results showed that the frame located in near-fault regions is extremely vulnerable to ground motions. The results also showed that the damage model better captures the damage distribution in the frame than inter-storey drifts. The first storey was identified as the most fragile and the inner columns of the first storey suffered most damage as indicated by the damage index. The findings would be helpful in the decision making process prior to the strengthening of buildings in near-fault regions.",

The beam section consists of a GFRP pultruded profile, a CFRP laminate, and a concrete block all wrapped up using filament winding. It was found that the thickness of the concrete block and the confinement by the filament-wound wrapping had a profound effect on the energy dissipation behaviour of the beam. Using a shear punching model, and comparing the predicted results with the experimental ones, it was found that beyond a given value of the concrete block thickness, the deformational behaviour of the beam shifts from brittle to ductile. It was also found that the filament-wound wrap had many benefits such as providing a composite action between the concrete block and the GFRP box, improving the stiffness of the beam, and most importantly, enhancing the load carrying ability through induced confinement of the concrete.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing efforts for improved fracture toughness of engineered cementitious materials address the inherent brittleness of the binding matrix at several different levels of the material\\'s geometric scale through the addition of various types of reinforcing fibers. Crack control is required for crack widths that cover the entire range of the grain size spectrum of the material, and this dictates the requirement of hybrid mixes combining fibers of different size (nano, micro, macro). Use of Carbon Nano-Tubes (CNT) and Carbon Nano-Fibers (CNFs) as additives is meant to extend the crack-control function down to the nano-scale where cracking is believed to initiate. In this paper the implications of enhanced toughness thus attained at the material nanostructure are explored, with reference to the global smeared constitutive properties of the material, through consistent interpretation of the reported experimental evidence regarding the behavior of engineered cementitious products to direct and indirect tension.",

Recovery of waste in Algeria has a considerable delay due to the absence of a policy favorable to the development of waste management. But many researchers have shown the possibility to reuse dredged sediments in road construction. Through Europe, recent research works have been already performed on dam sediments. Present study fits into the context of the valorization of dredged sediments from Fergoug dam. They are found in considerable quantities and mainly composed of mineral phases, organic matters and water. The reservoir sedimentation poses problems for the environment and water storage, dredging becomes necessary. Civil engineering is a common way of recycling for such materials. Dredged sediments have not the required mechanical characteristics recommended by the standards as GTR guide (LCPC-SETRA 1992). So as to obtain mechanical performance, dredged sediment can be treated with cement, lime, or replaced materials like quarry sand. An experimental study has been conducted to determine physical and mechanical characteristics of sediments dredged from dam. Then different mixtures of sediment and/or quarry sand with hydraulic binders are proposed for improving the grain size distribution of the mixes. Finally, according these mixtures, different formulations have been tested as alternative materials with dredged sediments.",

Ten specimens under room conditions and 10 specimens under fire exposure to the Eurocode smouldering slow-growth fire were tested to examine the effects of diameter to thickness D/t ratio and reinforcing bars on residual strength capacity, ductility and stiffness of CFST stub columns. On the other hand, in sixteen among the twenty specimens, three or six reinforcing bars were welded inside the steel tube. The longitudinal strains in the steel tube and load-displacement relationships were recorded throughout the subsequent compressive tests. Corresponding values of residual strength capacity calculated using AISC 360-10 and EC4 standards are presented for comparison purposes with the experimental results of this study. The test results showed that after exposure to 750oC, the residual strength capacity increased for all specimens, while the ductility and stiffness were slightly decreased.

One batch of a control mixture and one batch of a SC mixture were air-cured in the lab to act as non-water-cured samples. The water curing regimes for the control mixture included continuous water curing for 3, 7, and 28 days and periodical moist curing using wetted burlap for 3 and 7 days. Curing regimes for the SC mixtures included 3 days of water curing and periodical moist curing for 3 and 7 days. SC mixtures showed better microstructure development and durability performance than those of the air-cured control mixture. A short water curing period of 3 days significantly improved the performance of the SC mixtures similar to that of the control mixture that was water cured for 28 days. SC concrete represents a step towards sustainable construction due to its lower water demand needed for curing and hence can preserve the limited water resources in many parts of the world.",

The carbonation resistance of metakaolin blended concrete is lower than that of control concrete. Hence, it is critical to consider carbonation durability for rationally using metakaolin in the concrete industry. This study presents microstructure modeling during the carbonation of metakaolin blended concrete. First, based on a blended hydration mo del, the amount of carbonatable substances and porosity are determined. Second, based on the chemical reactions between carbon dioxide and carbonatable substances, the reduction of concrete porosity due to carbonation is calculated. Furthermore, CO2 diffusivity is evaluated considering the concrete composition and exposed environment. The carbonation depth of concrete is analyzed using a diffusion-based model. The proposed microstructure model takes into account the influences of concrete composition, concrete curing, and exposure condition on carbonation. The proposed model is useful as a predetermination tool for the evaluation of the carbonation service life of metakaolin blended concrete.",

    "abstract": "Progressive collapse in a structure occurs when load bearing members are failed and the adjoining structural elements cannot resist the redistributed forces and fails subsequently, that leads to complete collapse of structure. Recently, construction using precast concrete technology is adopted increasingly because it offers many advantages like faster construction, less requirement of skilled labours at site, reduced formwork and scaffolding, massive production with reduced amount of construction waste, better quality and better surface finishing as compared to conventional reinforced concrete construction. Connections are the critical elements for any precast structure, because in past, major collapse of precast structure took place because of connection failure. In this study, behavior of four different precast wet connections with U shaped reinforcement bars provided at different locations is evaluated. Reduced 1/3rd scale precast beam column assemblies having two span beam and three columns with removed middle column are constructed and examined by performing experiments. The response of precast connections is compared with monolithic connection, under column removal scenario. The connection region of test specimens are filled by cast-in-place micro concrete with and without polypropylene fibers. Performance of specimen is evaluated on the basis of ultimate load carrying capacity, maximum deflection at the location of removed middle column, crack formation and failure propagation. Further, Finite element (FE) analysis is carried out for validation of experimental studies and understanding the performance of structural components. Monolithic and precast beam column assemblies are modeled using non-linear Finite Element (FE) analysis based software ABAQUS. Actual experimental conditions are simulated using appropriate boundary and loading conditions. Finite Element simulation results in terms of load versus deflection are compared with that of experimental study. The nonlinear FE analysis results shows good agreement with experimental results.",

However, despite the superior performance of these composite materials in terms of corrosion, the effect of replacing steel reinforcement with GFRP on the seismic performance of concrete structures is not fully covered yet. To address some of the key parameters in the seismic behavior of GFRP-reinforced concrete (RC) structures, two full-scale beam-column joints reinforced with GFRP bars and stirrups were constructed and tested under two phases of loading, each simulating a severe ground motion. The objective was to investigate the effect of damage due to earthquakes on the service and ultimate behavior of GFRP-RC moment-resisting frames. The main parameters under investigation were geometrical configuration (interior or exterior beam-column joint) and joint shear stress. The performance of the specimens was measured in terms of lateral load-drift response, energy dissipation, mode of failure and stress distribution. Moreover, the effect of concrete damage due to earthquake loading on the performance of beamcolumn joints under service loading was investigated and a modified damage index was proposed to quantify the magnitude of damage in GFRP-RC beam-column joints under dynamic loading. Test results indicated that the geometrical configuration significantly affects the level of concrete damage and energy dissipation. Moreover, the level of residual damage in GFRP-RC beam-column joints after undergoing lateral displacements was related to reinforcement ratio of the main beams.",

The compressive strength and durability properties that included depth of water penetration, depth of carbonation, chloride diffusion coefficient, and resistance to reinforcement corrosion and sulfate attack were determined. Results of this study indicate that at all ages, the compressive strength of NP-admixed concrete mixtures was slightly less than that of the concrete containing OPC alone. However, the concrete mixtures containing NP exhibited lower depth of water penetration and chloride diffusion coefficient and more resistance to reinforcement corrosion and sulfate attack as compared to OPC. NP-admixed concrete showed relatively more depth of carbonation than OPC when subjected to accelerated carbonation.

As there is no wellestablished laboratory test method for evaluating the cavitation resistance of concrete, a test set up called \\'cavitation jet\\' was specially established in the present study in order to simulate the cavitation phenomenon experienced in the hydraulic structures. Various mixtures of concrete were designed by varying the grade of concrete, type and quantity of pozzolana, type of aggregates and cement type to develop good cavitation resistant concrete constructed using marginal aggregates. Three types of aggregates having three different Los Angeles abrasion values (less than 30%, between 30% and 50% and more than 50%) were employed in this study. To evaluate the cavitation resistance a total of 60 cylindrical specimens and 60 companion cubes were tested in the laboratory respectively. The results indicate that cavitation resistance of concrete degrades significantly as the L.A. abrasion value of aggregates goes beyond the 30% value. Incorporation of pozzolanic admixtures was seemed to be beneficial to enhance the cavitation resistance of concrete. Influence of other material parameters on the cavitation resistance of concrete was also noted and important observations have been made in the paper.",

This research aims to study the crack width correction equation of precast decks by performing static tests using high strength and normal strength concrete. Based on experimental results, the bending strength of the structural connections of the current precast deck is satisfied. However it is not suitable to calculate and control the crack width of precast loop connections using the current design equation.

    "abstract": "This paper reports on the results of a parametric study, which examines the effects of varying aspect ratios on the dynamic response of cylindrical silos directly supported on the ground under earthquake loading. Previous research has shown that numerical models can provide considerably realistic simulations when it comes to the behavior of silos by using correct boundary conditions, appropriate element types and material models. To this end, a three dimensional numerical model, taking into account the bulk material-silo wall interaction, was produced by the ANSYS commercial program, which is in turn based on the finite element method. The results obtained from the numerical analysis are discussed comparatively in terms of dynamic material pressure, horizontal displacement, equivalent base shear force and equivalent bending moment responses for considered aspect ratios. The effects experienced because of the slenderness of the silo in regards to the seismic response were evaluated along with the effectiveness of the classification system proposed by Eurocode in evaluating the loads on the vertical walls. Results clearly show that slenderness directly affects the seismic response of such structures especially in terms of behavior and the magnitude of the responses. Furthermore the aspect ratio value of 2.0, given as a behavioral changing limit in the technical literature, can be used as a valid limit for seismic behavior.",

The ability of polypropylene (PP) fibres waste used as reinforcement of these concrete materials to enhance their durability is also studied. Crushed sand 0/2 mm which is a fine limestone residue obtained by the crushing of natural rocks in aggregates industry is used for the fabrication of the mortar. The fibres used, which are obtained from the waste of domestic plastic sweeps\\' fabrication, have a length of 20 mm and a diameter ranging between 0.38 and 0.51 mm. Two weight fibres contents are used, 0.5 and 1%. The durability tests carried out in this investigation included the water absorption by capillarity, the mass variation, the flexural and the compressive strengths of the mortar specimens immersed for 366 days in 5% sodium chloride, 5% magnesium sulphate and 5% sulphuric acid solutions. A mineralogical analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a visual inspection are used for a better examination of the quality of tested mortars and for better interpretation of their behaviour in different solutions. The results indicate that the reinforcement of limestone mortar by PP fibres waste is an excellent solution to improve its chemical resistance and durability. Moreover, the presence of PP fibres waste does not affect significantly the water absorption by capillarity of mortar nether its mass variation, when exposed to chloride and sulphate solutions. While in sulphuric acid, the mass loss is higher with the presence of PP fibres waste, especially after an exposure of 180 days. The results reveal that these fibres have a considerable effect of the flexural and the compressive behaviour of mortar especially in acid\r\nsolution, where a reduction of strength loss is observed. The mineralogical analysis confirms the good behaviour of mortar immersed in sulphate and chloride solutions; and shows that more gypsum is formed in mortar exposed to acid environment causing its rapid degradation. The visual observation reveals that only samples exposed to acid attack during 366 days have showed a surface damage extending over a depth of approximately 300 um.",

In many regulations, lateral displacement was limited according to the properties of columns. The design displacement limits may be represented indirectly through the material strain limits and the mechanical properties of columns. EUROCODE-8 and FEMA356 calculate displacement limits by taking into account the mechanical properties of columns. However, Turkey Building Earthquake Code (TBEC) determine displacement limits by taking into account the material strain limits. The aim of this study is to assess the seismic design codes for RC columns through an experimental study. The estimates of seismic design codes have been compared with the experimental results. It is observed that the lateral displacement capacities of columns estimated according to some seismic codes are not in agreement with the experimental results. Also, it is observed that TBEC is conservative in the context of the performance indicator of RC columns, compared to EUROCODE-8 and FEMA356.

The simulations were carried out through finite element program ABAQUS/CAE and the results thus obtained were validated with the experiments available in literature. Six simply supported beams were modelled with two square openings of 200 and 250 mm sides considered as opening at centre, top and bottom of the beam. In order to define the material behaviour of concrete and reinforcing steel bar the Concrete Damaged Plasticity model and Johnson-Cook material parameters available in literature were employed. The numerical results were compared with the experiments in terms of ultimate failure load, displacement and von-Mises stresses. In addition to that, seventeen beams were simulated under static loading for studying the effect of opening location, size and shape of the opening and depth, span and shear span to depth ratio of the deep beam. In general, the numerical results accurately predicted the pattern of deformation and displacement and found in good agreement with the experiments. It was concluded that the structural response of deep beam was primarily dependent on the degree of interruption of the natural load path. An increase in opening size from 200 to 250 mm size resulted in an average shear strength reduction of 35%. The deep beams having circular openings undergo lesser deflection and thus they are preferable than square openings. An increase in depth from 500 mm to 550 mm resulted in 78% reduced deflection.",

Portland cement with w/(c+sf) ratios varying between 0.25 to 0.45 was substituted by 10%, 20% and 30% of SF by mass. A superplasticizer was used to maintain a fluid consistency of the concrete. The heat of hydration was monitored continuously by a semi-adiabatic calorimetric method for 10 days at 20oC. Compressive strengths are tested for each mixture until age of 180 days. The results show that silica fume considerably influences the evolution and the ultimate values of the compressive strengths as well as the hydration heat especially for 10% rate. The w/b ratio has a considerable effect where its decrease modifies compressive strength and hydration heat more than silica fume. The correlation of the obtained results allows deducing of ultimate properties as well as the ages to reach half of their values. The correlation coefficients are close to unity and reflect the judicious choice of these relationships to be used to predict compressive strength and hydration heat.",

Recent developments in the field of high-performance concrete marked a giant step forward in high-tech construction materials with enhanced durability, high compressive strength and high modulus of elasticity particularly for industrial applications. There is a growing awareness that specifications requiring high compressive strength make sense only when there are specific strength design advantages. HPC today employs blended cements that include silica fume, fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag. In typical formulations, these cementitious materials can exceed 25% of the total cement by weight. Silica fume contributes to strength and durability; and fly ash and slag cement to better finish, decreased permeability, and increased resistance to chemical attack. The influences of various mineral admixtures such as fly ash, silica fume, micro silica, slag etc. on the performance of high-strength concrete are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The problem of reducing the self-weight of reinforced concrete structures is very important issue. There are two approaches which may be used to reduced member weight. The first is tackled through reducing the cross sectional area by using voids and the second through using light weight materials. Reducing the weight of slabs is very important as it constitutes the effective portion of dead loads in the structural building. Eleven slab specimens was casted in this research. The slabs are made one way though using two simple supports. The tested specimens comprised three reference solid slabs and eight styropor block slabs having (23% and 29%) reduction in weight. The voids in slabs were made using styropor at the ineffective concrete zones in resisting the tensile stresses. All slab specimens have the dimensions (1100x 600x120 mm) except one solid specimens has depth 85 mm (to give reduction in weight of 29% which is equal to the styropor block slab reduction). Two loading positions or cases (A and B) (as two-line monotonic loads) with shear span to effective depth ratio of (a/d=3, 2) respectively, were used to trace the structural behavior of styropor block slab. The best results are obtained for styropor block slab strengthened by minimum shear reinforcement with weight reduction of (29%). The increase in the strength capacity was (8.6% and 5.7%) compared to the solid slabs under loading cases A and B respectively. Despite the appearance of cracks in styropor block slab with loads lesser than those in the solid slab, the development and width of cracks in styropor block slab is significantly restricted as a result of presence a mesh of reinforcement in upper concrete portion.",

The effect of different Water-to-Solid ratio (W/S) and various replacement percentages of bentonite on the apparent viscosity, bleeding, setting time, and early compressive strength of BCS grout were investigated. The XRD method was used to detect its hydration products. The results showed that both bentonites played a positive role in the stability of BCS grout, increased its apparent viscosity. Na-bent prolonged the setting time of BCS, while 5% of Li-bent shortened the setting time of BCS. The XRD analysis indicated that the hydration products between the mixture containing Na-bent and Li-bent did not differ much. Using bentonite as supplementary cementitious material (SCM) to replace partial cement is a promising way to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions and to produce low-cost, eco-friendly, non-toxic, and water-resistant grout. In addition, Li-bent was superior to Na-bent in improving the strength and the thickening of BCS grouts.",

This work has two objectives to develop the mixing procedure required to create UHPC in large batches and to study the flexural behavior of the prestressed girder. The results demonstrate that a sizeable batch of UHPC can be produced by using a conventional concrete mixing system at any precast factory. In addition, incorporating local aggregates and using conventional mixing systems enables regional widespread\r\nuse. The flexural behavior of a girder made by this UHPC is investigated including flexural strength, cracking pattern and development, load-deflection curve, and strain and neutral axis behaviors through a comprehensive bending test. The experimental data is similar to the theoretical results from analytical methods based on several standards and recommendations of UHPC design.",

    "abstract": "Reduction of disposal of waste materials due to construction demolition has become a great concern in recent decades. The research work presents the hardened properties of concrete where the partial substitution of recycled coarse aggregate with natural aggregate in amount of 0%, 10%, 30% and 50%. By using different mixed proportions, fresh and hardened properties of concrete were conducted for this investigation. These properties were compared with control concrete. It can be seen that all of the hardened properties of concrete were decreased with the increasing percentage of recycled aggregate in concrete mixes. It was noticed that up to 30% recycled aggregate replacement can be yielded the optimum strength when it used in normal concrete. Finally, it can be said that disposed recycled concrete utilizing as a partial replacement in natural aggregate is a great way to reuse and reduce environmental hazards which achieve sustainability approach in the construction industry.",

    "abstract": "Progressive collapse is one of the factors which if not predicted at the time of structure plan; its occurrence will lead to catastrophic damages. Through having a glance over important structures chronicles in the world, we will notice that the reason of their collapse is a minor damage in structure caused by an accident like a terrorist attack, smashing a vehicle, fire, gas explosion, construction flaws and its expanding. Progressive collapse includes expanding rudimentary rupture from one part to another which leads to total collapse of a structure or a major part it. This study examines the progressive collapse of a 5-story concrete building with three column eliminating scenarios, including the removal of the corner, side and middle columns with the ABAQUS software. Then the beams and the bottom of the concrete slab were reinforced by (reinforcement of carbon fiber reinforced polymer) FRP and then the structure was re-analyzed. The results of the analysis show that the reinforcement of carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets is one of the effective ways to rehabilitate and reduce the progressive collapse in concrete structures.",

    "abstract": "The conventional ACI rectangular stress block is developed on the basis of normal-strength concrete column tests\r\nand it is still being used for the design of high-strength concrete members. Many research papers found in the literature indicate that the nominal strength of high-strength concrete members appears to be over-predicted by the ACI rectangular stress block. This is especially true for HSC columns. The general shape of the stress-strain curve of high-strength concrete becomes more likely as a triangle. A triangular stress block is, therefore, introduced in this paper. The proposed stress block is verified using a database which consists of 52 tested singly reinforced high-strength concrete beams having concrete strength above 55 MPa (8,000 psi). In addition, the proposed model is compared with models of various design codes and proposals of researchers found in the literature. The nominal flexural strengths computed using the proposed stress block are in a good agreement with\r\nthe tested data as well as with that obtained from design codes models and proposals of researchers.",

    "abstract": "Essentially, when electrical current flows easily in concrete that has large pores filled with highly connective pore water, this is an indication of a low resistivity concrete. In concrete, the flow of current between anodic and cathodic sites on a steel reinforcing bar surface is regulated by the concrete electrical resistance. Therefore, deterioration of any existing reinforced concrete structure due to corrosion of reinforcement steel bar is governed, to some extent, by resistivity of concrete. Resistivity of concrete can be improved by using SCMs and thus increases the concrete electrical resistance and the ability of concrete to resist chloride ingress and/or oxygen penetration resulting in prolonging the onset of corrosion. After depassivation it may slow down the corrosion rate of the steel bar. This indicates the need for further study of the effect of electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) addition on the concrete resistivity. In this study, concrete specimens rather than mortars were cast with different additions of EAFD to verify the electrochemical results obtained and to try to understand the role of EAFD addition in influencing the corrosion behaviour of reinforcing steel bar embedded in concrete and its relation to the resistivity of concrete. The results of these investigations indicated that the corrosion resistance of steel bars embedded in concrete containing EAFD was improved, which may link to the high resistivity found in EAFD-concrete. In this paper, potential measurements, corrosion rates, gravimetric corrosion weight results and resistivity measurements will be presented and their relationships will also be discussed in details.",

The widened superstructure system consists of a newly built composite steel-concrete girder with concrete deck and steel diaphragms attached to the existing concrete girders. This method has been applied in several bridge widening projects in China, and one of those projects is presented in detail. Due to the higher stiffness-to-weight ratio and the rapid erection of composite girders, this widening method reveals benefits in both mechanical performance and construction. As only a few methods for the design of bridges with different types of girders are recommended in current design codes, a more accurate analytical method of estimating live load distribution on girder bridges was developed. In the analytical model, the effects of span length, girder pacing, diaphragms, concrete decks were considered, as well as the torsional and flexural stiffness of both composite box girders and concrete T girders. The study shows that the AASHTO LRFD specification procedures and the analytical models proposed in this paper closely approximate the live load distribution factors determined by finite element analysis. A parametric study was also conducted using the finite element method to evaluate the potential load carrying capacities of the existing concrete girders after widening.",

The influence of addition of steel fibres on the strength and behaviour of steel fibre reinforced high performance concrete (SFRHPC) interior beam-column-slab joints was investigated experimentally. The specimens were subjected to reverse cyclic loading. The variable considered was the volume fraction of crimped steel fibres i.e., 0%, 0.5% and 1.0%.

Four different curing regimes were adopted during the initial 10 h of curing to evaluate the potential of carbonation curing as an alternative to conventional steam curing in the precast concrete industry from environmental and practical viewpoints. Four combinations of carbonation and steam curing conditions were applied as curing regimes to the samples at an early age. The test results indicated that the samples treated with the combined carbonation and steam curing exhibited higher early strength development compared to the other samples, signifying that carbonation curing can reduce the production time of precast concrete. Furthermore, the CO2 uptake capacity of the samples was calculated and found to be as high as 18% with respect to the mass of the paste samples. Hence, the simultaneous utilization of steam and CO2 for the fabrication of precast concrete members has the potential to make precast concrete greener and more costeffective.",

Currently, the use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) is becoming mandatory due to economic, environmental, and sustainable issues. There is a decreasing trend in pH of CBMs due to incorporation of SCMs. The determination of numerical values of pH is very important for various low and high volume SCMs blended cement mortars for the better understanding of different defects and durability issues during their service life. In addition, the effect of cement hydration and pozzolanic reaction of SCMs on the pH should be determined at initial and later ages. In this study, the effect of low and high-volume fly ash (FA) and ground granulated ballast furnace slag (GGBFS) cement mortars in different curing conditions on their pH values has been determined. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to support the findings from pH measurements. In addition, thermal conductivity (k-value) and strength activity indices of these cement mortars were discussed. The results showed that pH values of all blended cement mortars were less than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) mortar in all curing conditions used. There was a decreasing tendency in pH of all mortars with passage of time. In addition, the pH of cement mortars was not only dependent on the quantity of Ca(OH)2. The effect of adding SCMs on the pH value of cement mortar should be monitored and measured for both short and long terms.",

Two ways were adopted to incorporate the nano silica sand into the mixture: with part of mixing water and with pre-formed foam bubbles. Compared to conventional foam concrete, it was found that using micro silica sand helped in improving strength (169%), reducing absorbed water (38%) and reducing shrinkage (40%) by enhancing both cement paste microstructure and pore structure. This pore structure enhancement was achieved by reducing pores merging leading to making a narrow pore size distribution and more circular pores with large spaces between them. On the other hand, increasing fineness of normal sand and\r\nusing nano silica sand resulted in less enhancing in foam concrete properties compared with using the silica sand as its own (at micro level). It was noticed that incorporating the nano particles into mixture with foam bubbles was more effective than the\r\nconventional way; with mixing water.",

    "abstract": "Commonly used concrete in general, consists of cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate and water. Natural river sand is the most commonly used material as fine aggregate in concrete. One of the important requirements of concrete is that it should be durable under certain conditions of exposure. The durability of concrete is defined as its ability to resist weathering action, chemical attack or any other process of deterioration. Durable concrete will retain its original form, quality and serviceability when exposed to its environment. Deterioration can occur in various forms such as alkali aggregate expansion, freeze-thaw expansion, salt scaling by de-icing salts, shrinkage, attack on the reinforcement due to carbonation, sulphate attack on exposure to ground water, sea water attack and corrosion caused by salts. Addition of admixtures may control these effects. In this paper, an attempt has been made to replace part of fine aggregate by tailing material and part of cement by fly ash to improve the durability of concrete. The various durability tests performed were chemical attack tests such as sulphate attack, chloride attack and acid attack test and water absorption test. The concrete blend with 35% Tailing Material (TM) in place of river sand and 20% Fly Ash (FA) in place of OPC, has exhibited higher durability characteristics.",

A superplasticizer with a ratio of 3% of the cement was used for all productions. 40x40x160 mm prismatic specimens were prepared and tested for flexural and compression. The specimens were exposed to two different curing conditions as autoclave and standard curing condition. Autoclave exposure was performed for 3 hours under a pressure of 2 MPa. It was observed that the compressive strength of concrete, along with the flexural strength exposed to autoclave was quite high compared to the strength of concretes subjected to standard curing. The results obtained indicated that the compressive strength, along with the flexural strength of autoclaved concrete increased as the amount of cement used increases. Approximately 15% increase in flexural strength was achieved with a 4% steel fiber addition. The maximum compressive strength that has been reached is over 210 MPa for reactive powder concrete for the same steel fiber ratio and with a cement content of 960 kg/m3. The relationship between compressive strength and flexural strength of reactive powder concrete exposed to both curing conditions was also identified.",

    "abstract": "Stress-strain models of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) confined concrete have been widely investigated; however, the existing load which is always supported by structures during the retrofitting phase, namely \\'preload\\', has been neglected. Thus, preload effects should be clarified, providing insightful information for FRP retrofitting of structures with preload conditions. Towards this aim, experiments were performed for 27 cylinder concrete specimens with the diameter 150 mm and the height 300 mm. Three specimens were used to test the compressive strength of concrete to compute the preloads 20%, 30% and 40% of the average strength of these specimens. Other 24 specimens were divided into 2 groups; each group included 4 subgroups. Four subgroups were subjected to the above preloads and no preload, and were then wrapped by 2 FRP layers. Similar designation is applied to group 2, but wrapped by 3 FRP layers. All specimens were tested under axial compression to failure. Explosive failure is found to be the characteristic of specimens wrapped by FRP. Experimental results indicated that the preload decreases 12-13% the elastic and second stiffness of concrete specimens wrapped by 2 FRP layers. The stiffness reduction can be mitigated by the increase of FRP layers. Preload negligibly reduces the ultimate force and unclearly affects the ultimate displacement probably due to complicated cracks developed in concrete. A mechanism of preload effects is presented in the paper. Finally, to take into account preload effects, a modification of the widely used model of un-preload FRP confined concrete is proposed and the modified model demonstrated with a reasonable accuracy.",

According to the framework, a new method calculating the reliability was proposed through probability simulation in order to describe a random accumulation of fatigue damage, which combines reliability theory, one-to-one probability density functions transformation technique, cumulative fatigue damage theory and Weibull distribution theory. Then the statistical analysis of flexural fatigue performance of cement concrete tested was carried out utilizing Weibull distribution. Ultimately, the reliability for the tested cement concrete was obtained by the proposed method. Results indicate that the stochastic evolution behavior of concrete materials under fatigue loading can be captured by the established framework. The flexural fatigue life data of concrete at different stress levels is well described utilizing the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The evolution of reliability for concrete materials tested in this study develops by three stages and may corresponds to develop stages of cracking. The proposed method may also be available for the analysis of degradation behaviors under non-fatigue conditions.",

    "abstract": "Substitution of natural fine aggregates with industrial by-products like precious slag balls (PS Balls) offers various advantages like technical, economic and environmental which are very important in the present era of sustainability in construction industry. PS balls are manufactured by subjecting steel slag to slag atomizing Technology (SAT) which imparts them the desirable characteristics of fine aggregates. The main objective of this research paper is to assess the feasibility of producing good quality concrete by using PS balls, to identify the potential benefits by their incorporation and to provide solution for increasing their utilization in concrete applications. The study investigates the effect of PS balls as partial replacement of fine aggregates in various percentages (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) on mechanical properties of concrete such as compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexural strength. The optimum mix was found to be at 40% replacement of PS balls with maximum strength of 62.89 MPa at 28 days curing. Permeability of concrete was performed and it resulted in a more durable concrete with replacement of PS balls at 40% and 100% as fine aggregates. These two specific values were considered as optimum replacement is 40% and also the maximum possible replacement is 100%. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was done and it was found that the PS balls in concrete were unaffected and with optimum percentage of PS balls as fine aggregates in concrete resulted in good strength and less cracks. Hence, it is possible to produce good workable concrete with low water to cement ratio and higher strength concrete by incorporating PS balls.",

A significant number of research studies have been conducted on various types of fibers and their influence on the tensile capacity of concrete. However, as an important property, tensile capacity of fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) is not modelled properly. Therefore, this paper intends to formulate a model based on experiments that show the relationship between the fiber properties such as the aspect ratio (length/diameter), fiber content, compressive strength, flexural strength and splitting strength of FRC. For the purpose of modeling, various FRC mixes only with steel fiber are adopted from the existing research papers. Automated neural network search (ANS) is then developed and used to investigate the effect of input parameters such as fiber content, aspect ratio and compressive strength to the output parameters of flexural and splitting strength of FRC. It is found that the ANS model can be used to predict the flexural and splitting strength of FRC in a sensible precision.",

The contributions to the shear strength from both truss and arch mechanisms are incorporated in the proposed model. The effects of corrosion level of transverse reinforcements are considered in the proposed model through the minimum residual cross-sectional area of transverse reinforcements and the reduction of concrete compressive strength for the cover area.

In this way, a set of 276 cylindrical RCC specimens were prepared with different RAP sizes (i.e., fine, coarse & total) at various ratios (i.e., 10%, 20%, and 40%). Results reveal that incorporation of RAP decreases unconfined compressive strength (UCS), modulus of elasticity (E), and indirect tensile (IDT) strength of RCC. For each RAP size, a regression model was used to maximize RAP content while satisfying the UCS lower limit (27.6 Mpa) mentioned by ACI as a minimum requirement for RCC used in pavement construction. Moreover, UCS of RAP incorporated mixes, dissimilar to that of control mixes, was found to be sensitive and insensitive to the testing temperature and curing time after 7 days, respectively. The results also demonstrate that the higher amounts of RAP, the more flexibility in RCC is. This issue was also proved by the results of modulus of elasticity test. In addition, the toughness index (TI) shows that increase in RAP content leads to up to 43% increase in energy absorbance capacity of RCC.",

Despite the high tensile ductility and high toughness of ECC, transverse steel reinforcement is still necessary to confine ECC for high performance. However, limited research has examined performance of ECC confined with practical amount of transverse reinforcement. This paper presents the results of axial compression tests on 14 square ECC columns and 4 conventional concrete columns (used as control specimens) with transverse reinforcement. The test variables were spacing, configuration (square ties or square and diamond shape ties), and yield strength of stirrups. The test showed that ECC columns confined with steel stirrup had good compressive ductility, and the stirrup spacing had the greatest effect on the compressive performance. The self-confinement effect of ECC results in a more uniform but slower expansion of the whole column compared with CC ones. The test results are then compared against the predictions from a number of existing models for conventional confined concrete. It is indicated that these models fail to predict the axial strains at peak axial stress and the trend of the stress-strain curve of steel stirrups-confined ECC with sufficient accuracy. Several new equations are then proposed for the compressive properties of steel-confined ECC based on test results and potential approaches for future studies are proposed.",

The effectiveness of key parameters, including cement content, water to cement ratio (W/C), aggregate to cement ratio (A/C), and sand replacement was statistically analyzed using paired-samples t-test, Taguchi method and one-way ANOVA. Taguchi analysis determined that in general, the role of W/C was more significant in increasing strength, both compressive and flexural, than cement content and A/C. It was found that increase in replacing percent of coarse aggregate with sand could undermine specimens to percolate water, though one-way ANOVA analysis determined statistically significant increases in values of strength of mixtures. Cost analysis revealed that higher strengths did not necessarily correspond to higher costs; in addition, increasing the cement content was not an appropriate scenario to optimize both strength and cost. In order to obtain the optimal values, response surface method (RSM) was carried out. RSM optimization helped to find out that W/C of 0.40, A/C of 4.0, cement content of about 330 kg/m3 and replacing about 12% of coarse aggregate with sand could result in the best values for strength and cost while maintaining adequate permeability.",

Significant damage can occur in concrete structures due to cracking because of the chemical reactions taking place. Various mineral and chemical additives have been used so far to mitigate ASR and/or to reduce its adverse effects. In this study, ground trachyte and rhyolite provided from Rize-Cagrankaya region, Turkey, were used to investigate their effectiveness in controlling ASR-induced damage by substituting them with cement at certain ratios. In this context, initially the possible use of trachyte and rhyolite as pozzolanas was determined in accordance with BS EN 450-1 and TS 25 standards by considering their pozzolanic activities and then their effectiveness in mitigating the ASR was evaluated as per ASTM C 1567-13.

Tests of their compressive strength and splitting tensile strength were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of fiber type and fiber-volume fraction in lightweight concrete at 28 days and after 90 days. The results indicated that using fibers in lightweight concrete improved both the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength. The addition of fibers in lightweight concrete showed a positive effect, and the effectiveness of PVA fiber at 28 and 90 days (regarding compressive strength and splitting tensile strength) was more pronounced than steel fiber. Overall, it can be concluded that the 1.0% PVA fiber-volume fraction showed good performance in the lightweight concrete.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the experimental results of research into the behavior of shear-enhanced reinforced concrete R.C beams using steel stirrups, Fiber Reinforced Polymers FRP rods, and Fiber Reinforced Polymers FRP strips. This enhancement was accomplished by the Near Surface Mounted technique NSM. The NSM technique contains a groove on the outside surface of the concrete member to adjust the depth to be less than the cover of the member. After cleaning, the epoxy paste was used to fill half of the groove's depth. In the groove, the particular FRP element is then installed. Finally, the groove is filled with epoxy and the outside surface of the concrete is levelled with so much epoxy. This method enables the fiber reinforcement polymer FRP materials is covered completely by epoxy. The objective of this research is to study the effect of NSM technique on shear resistance for stressed beam. 13 experimental studies of half-scale R.C beams were involved in this paper. The experimental program included two specimens strengthened with steel stirrups, eight specimens strengthened with stirrups of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer GFRP rods with the shape of deferent end anchorage and angle, two specimens strengthened with externally bonded GFRP strips. The remaining un-strengthened specimen was allocated for comparison as a control one. The test results included ultimate load of capacity, deflection, cracking, and failure mode. All beams enhanced with GFRP rods showed a capacity improvement ranging from 14% to 85% compared to the reference beam, and compared to the reference beam, beams enhanced with GFRP strips showed a capacity improvement ranging from 7% to 22%.",

Concrete mixes are designed for different combinations of FAC (60%, 80% and 100%), SF (10%, 15% and 20%) and water-binder (W/B) ratio (0.40, 044 and 0.48) and their mechanical and physical properties are evaluated.

The combinations of 15% SF with 80% FAC at 0.44 and 0.40 W/B ratios result in the properties closer to or even better than the normal concrete. Moreover, the environmental impacts of the concrete mixes comprised of high-volume FAC with addition of SF at different W/B ratio reduce in the range 5.37%-18.86% with respect to the normal concrete. Hence, the structural LWC mixes become sustainable, as they are advantageous from both environmental and social considerations.",

In this paper, the behavior of high-volume Class-F fly ash (FA) and slag (SL) incorporated Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) as overlay materials was assessed when they were under cyclic freezing and thawing effect. Silica fume concrete (SFC) was also tested as a control mixture which is generally used for overlaying purposes. Layered ECC/substrate concrete (SC) and SFC/SC beam specimens were produced and subjected to 300 freeze-thaw cycles in accordance with ASTM C666, Procedure A. Laboratory tests performed using the layered specimens were based on the determination changes of (i) residual mechanical properties (flexural strength -mid-span beam deflection curves), (ii) ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), (iii) mass loss, (iv) relative dynamic modulus of elasticity (RDME) and (v) durability factor (DF). Test results show that all layered specimens produced with different ECC mixtures safely survived 300 freeze-thaw cycles without any disturbance between the ECC overlay and SC interface. On the other hand, one out of six tested SFC/SC layered specimens survived 300 freeze-thaw cycles and final failure for five failed specimens took place from the interfacial planes. Significantly better frost resistance of overlaid systems produced with ECCs than those with SFC was also verified with all of the tests proposed. Between different ECC mixtures, those produced with slag performed better than that those with Class-F fly ash.",

Thus, this paper proposes an open polygonal composite stirrup with high strength and high ductility CRB600H reinforced rebar, and seventeen specimens were constructed, and their axial compressive performance was tested. The main parameters considered were the volume-stirrup ratio, the steel tube size, the stirrup type and the stirrup strength. The test results indicated: For the specimens restrained by open octagonal composite stirrups, compared with the specimen of 0.5% volume-stirrup ratio, the compressive bearing capacity increased by 14.6%, 15.7% and 21.5% for volume-stirrup ratio of 0.73%, 1.07% and 1.61%, respectively. For the specimens restrained by open composite rectangle stirrups, compared with the specimen of 0.79% volume-stirrup ratio, the compressive bearing capacity increased by 7.5%, 6.1%, and -1.4% for volume-stirrup ratio of 1.12%, 1.58% and 2.24%, respectively. The restraint ability and the bearing capacity of the octagonal composite stirrup are better than other stirrup types. The specimens equipped with open polygonal composite stirrup not only had a higher ductility than those with the traditional closed-loop stirrup, but they also had a higher axial bearing capacity than those with an HPB300 strength grades stirrup. Therefore, the open composite stirrup can be used in practical engineering. A new calculation method was proposed based on the stress-strain models for confined concrete under different restrain conditions, and the predicted value was close to the experimental value.",

For this purpose, the rheological properties shown by different compositions of cement paste, the most fundamental component of concrete, were assessed, and the correlation between the rheological properties and key performance functions was analyzed. The results of the experiments indicated that the overall properties of a binder have a greater influence on the yield stress than the plastic viscosity. When the performance of a cementitious material for 3D printing was considered in relation with the properties of a binder, a mixture with FA or SF was thought to be more appropriate; however, a mixture containing GGBS was found to be inappropriate as it failed to meet the required function especially, buildability and extrudability. For a simple quantitative evaluation, the correlation between the rheological parameters of cementitious materials and simplified flow performance test results-time taken to reach T-150 and the number of hits required to reach T-150—in consideration of the flow of cementitious materials was compared. The result of the analysis showed a high reliability for the correlation between the rheological parameters and the time taken to reach T-150, but a low reliability for the number of hits needed for the fluid to reach T-150. In conclusion, among several performance functions, extrudability and buildability were mainly assessed based on the results obtained from various formulations from a rheological perspective, and the suitable formulations of composite materials for 3D printing was derived.",

The joint is subjected to surface traction loadings applied at both ends of the concrete substrate layer. By introducing two interfacial shear and normal stress functions on the CFRP-concrete interface, based on Euler-Bernoulli beam idea and static stress equations of equilibrium, the entire stress fields of the joint were determined. The complementary strain energy was minimized in order to solve the governing equation of the joint. This yields an ordinary differential equation from which the interfacial normal and shear stresses were proposed explicitly, satisfying all the multiple traction boundary conditions. Lamination theory for composite materials was also employed to obtain the interfacial stresses. The proposed approach was validated by the analytic models in the literature as well as through a comprehensive computational code generated by the authors. Furthermore, a numerical verification was carried out via the finite element software ABAQUS. In the end, a scaling analysis was conducted to analyze the interfacial stress field dependence of the joint upon effective issues using the devised code.",

In this paper, a particular case study of an operational tunnel structure is presented for the serious cracking and spalling behaviours of concrete lining, focusing on the multi-factors inducing lining failure. An integrated field investigation is implemented to characterize the spatial distribution of damages and detailed site situations. According to results of nondestructive inspection, insufficient lining thickness and cavity behind lining are the coupled-inducement of lining failure bahaviors. To further understanding of the lining structure performance influenced by these multiple construction deficiencies, a reliable numerical simulation based on extended finite element method (XFEM) is performed by using the finite element software. The numerical model with 112 m longitudinal calculation, 100 m vertical calculation and 43 m vertical depth, and the concrete lining with 1450 solid elements are set enrichment shape function for the aim of simulating cracking behavior. The numerical simulation responses are essentially in accordance with the actual lining damaging forms, especially including a complete evolutionary process of lining spalling. This work demonstrates that the serious lining damaging behaviors are directly caused by a combination of insufficient thickness lining and cavity around the surrounding rocks. Ultimately, specific maintenance work is design based on the construction deficiencies, and that is confirmed as an efficient, time-saving and safe maintenance method in the operational railway tunnel.",

Usually in sulphate environment the minimum grade of concrete is M30 and the mix design is done for target mean strength of 39 MPa. Silpozz is manufactured by burning of agro-waste rice husk in designed furnace in between 600o to 700oC which is one of the main agricultural residues obtained from the outer covering of rice grains during the milling process. There are four mix series taken with control mix. The control mix made 0% replacement of FA and silpozz with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). The first mix series made 0% FA and 10-30% replacement of silpozz with OPC. The second mix series made with 10% FA and 10-40% replacement of silpozz with OPC. The third mix series made 20% FA and 10-30% replacement of silpozz with OPC and the fourth mix series made 30% FA and 10-20% silpozz replaced with OPC.

This paper conducted a numerical study to investigate the static behavior of damaged stud shear connectors that were embedded in ultra high performance concrete (UHPC). Parameters included damage degree and damage location. The material nonlinear behavior was characterized by multi-linear stress-strain relationship and damage plasticity model. The results indicated that the shear strength was not sensitive to the damage degree when the damage occurred at 2/3d (d is the stud diameter) from the stud root. An increased stud area would be engaged in resisting shear force as the distance of damage location from stud root increased and the failure section becomes inclined, resulting in a less reduction in the shear strength and shear stiffness. The reduction factor was proposed to consider the degradation of the shear strength of the damaged stud. The reduction factor can be calculated using two approaches: a linear relationship and a square relationship with the damage degree corresponding to the shear strength dominated by the section area and the nominal diameter of the damaged stud. It was found that the proposed method is preferred to predict the shear strength of a stud with initial damage.",

    "abstract": "The influence of temperature on the material of concrete filled columns (CFCs) under axial loading has been quantitatively studied in this research. CFCs have many various advantages and disadvantages. One of the important inefficiency of classic CFCs design is the practical lack of hooped compression under the operational loads because of the fewer variables of Poisson\\'s rate of concrete compared to steel. This is the reason why the holder tends to break away from the concrete core in elastic stage. It is also suggested to produce concrete filled steel tube columns with an initial compressed concrete core to surpass their design. Elevated temperatures have essentially reduced the strengths of steel tubes and the final capacity of CFCs exposed to fire. Thus, the computation of bearing capacity of concrete filled steel tube columns is studied here. Sometimes, the structures of concrete could be exposed to the high temperatures during altered times, accordingly, outcomes have shown a decrement in compressive-strength, then an increase with the reduction of this content. In addition, the moisture content at the minimal strength is declined with temperature rising. According to Finite Element (FE), the column performance assessment is carried out according to the axial load carrying capacities and the improvement of ductility and strength because of limitations. Self-stress could significantly develop the ultimate stiffness and capacity of concrete columns. In addition, the design equations for the ultimate capacity of concrete columns have been offered and the predictions satisfactorily agree with the numerical results. The proposed based model (FE model of PEC column) 65% aligns with the concrete exposed to high temperature. Therefore, computed solutions have represented a better perception of structural and thermal responses of CFC in fire.",

The bearing capacity of specimen decreases as the eccentricity or the CFRP strips spacing increases. The stressstrain relation of specimens undergoes two stages: parabolic and linear stages. In the parabolic stage, the slope of stress-strain curve decreases gradually as the eccentricity of axial loading increases while the CFRP strips spacing has little effect on the slope of stress-strain curve. For the linear stage, the slope of stress-strain curve decreases as the eccentricity of axial load or the CFRP strips spacing increases.

For self-compacted concrete, 48 corbels were rehabilitated with different parameters where 12 corbels were rehabilitated by BFM with and without epoxy injection, 18 heated corbels with three different high-temperature level were rehabilitated by repairing cracks only by epoxy injection, and 18 heated corbels with three different high-temperature level were rehabilitated by repairing cracks by epoxy and wrapping by BFF. All 48 corbels have two values of compressive strength, three values volumetric ratios of SF, and two values of the shear span. Test results indicate that RC corbels rehabilitated by BFM only without injection did not show any increase in the ultimate load capacity. Moreover, For RC corbels that were repaired by epoxy without basalt wrapping, the ultimate load capacities showed an increase depending on the mode of failure of corbels before the rehabilitation. However, the rehabilitation with only crack repairing by epoxy injection is more effective on medium strength corbels as compared to high strength ones. Finally, it can be concluded that use of BFF is an effective and powerful technique for the strengthening of damaged RC corbels.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of horizontal casting joints on the mechanical properties and structural behavior of sustainable self-compacting reinforced concrete beams (SCRCB). The experimental research consisted of two stages. The first stage used four types of concrete mixtures which were produced to indicate the effects of cement replaced with cement waste at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% by weight of cement content on fresh concrete properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) such as, passing ability, filling ability, and segregation resistance. In addition, mechanical properties such as compressive, tensile, and\r\nflexural strength were also studied. The second stage selected the best mixture from the first stage and studied the effect of horizontal casting joints on the structural behavior of sustainable SCRCBs. The effect of horizontal casting joints on the mechanical properties and structural behavior were at the 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of sample height. Load deflection, failure mode, and theoretical analysis were studied. Results indicated that the incorporation of replacement with cement waste by 5% to\r\n10% led to economic and environmental advantages, and the results were acceptable for fresh and mechanical properties. The results indicated that delaying the time for casting the second layer and increasing the cement waste in concrete mixtures had a great effect on the mechanical properties of SCC. The ultimate load capacity of horizontal casting joints reinforced concrete beams slightly decreased compared with the control beam. The maximum deflection of casting joint beams with 75% of samples height is similar with the control beam. The experimental results of reinforced concrete beams were substantially acceptable with the theoretical results. The failure modes obtained the best forced casting joint on the structural behavior at 50% height of casting in the beam.",

The aim of the project was to assess the use of RTSF in everyday construction practice. The Anagennisi partners, Dulex Ltd in collaboration with Gradmont-Gradacac Ltd and University of Zagreb, designed, cast and monitored the long-term shrinkage deformations of the indoor slab-on-grade slab at Gradmont's precast concrete factory in Gradacac, Bosnia and Herzegovina. A hybrid RTSF mix (20 kg/m3 of MSF+10 kg/m3 of RTSF) was used to comply with the design criteria which included a maximum load capacity of 20 kN/m2. The slab was monitored for one year using surveying equipment and visual inspection of cracks. During the monitoring period, the slab exhibited reasonable deformations (a maximum displacement of 3.3\r\nmm for both, horizontal and vertical displacements) whilst after five years in use, the owners did not report any issues and were satisfied with the construction methodology and materials used. This work confirms that RSTF is a viable and sustainable solution for slab-on-grade applications.",

    "abstract": "Self compacting concrete (SCC) has good flowability, passability and segregation resistance because of voluminous cementitious material & high coarse aggregate to fine aggregate ratio, and high free water availability. But these factors make it highly susceptible to shrinkage. Fibers are known to reduce shrinkage in concrete mixes. Until now for conserving cement, only pozzolanic materials are admixed in concrete to yield a SCC. Hence, this study compares the use of wollastonite micro fiber (WMF), a cheap pozzolanic easily processed raw mineral fiber, and flyash in yielding economical SCC for rigid pavement. Microsilica was used as a complimentary material with both admixtures. Since WMF has large surface area (827 m2/kg), is acicular in nature; therefore its use in yielding SCC was dubious. Binary and ternary mixes were constituted for WMF and flyash, respectively. Paste mixes were tested for compatibility with superplasticizer and trials were performed on a normal concrete mix of flexural strength 4.5 MPa to yield SCC. Flexural strength test and restrained shrinkage test were performed on those mixes, which qualified self compacting criteria. Results revealed that WMF admixed pastes have high water demand, and comparable setting times to flyash mixes. Workability tests showed that 20% WMF with microsilica (5-7.5%) is efficient enough in achieving SCC and higher flexural strength than normal concrete at 90 days. Also, stress rate due to shrinkage was lesser and time duration for final strain was higher in WMF admixed SCC which encourages its use in yielding a SCC than pozzolanic materials.",

Fibres under different inclination angles provide different strength contribution of a given crack width. For that the pull-out response of inclined fibres is of great importance to understand SFRC behaviour, particularly in the case of fibres with hooked ends, which are the most widely used. The paper focuses on the numerical modelling of the pull-out response of this kind of fibres from high-strength cementitious matrix in order to study the effects of different inclination angles of the fibres to the load-displacement pull-out curves. The pull-out of the fibres is studied by means of accurate three-dimensional finite element models, which take into account the nonlinearities that are present in the physical model, such as the nonlinear bonding between the fibre and the matrix in the early stages of the loading, the unilateral contact between the fibre and the matrix, the friction at the contact areas, the plastification of the steel fibre and the plastification and cracking of the cementitious matrix. The bonding properties of the fibre-matrix interface considered in the numerical model are based on experimental results of pull-out tests on straight fibres.",

An original and comprehensive design procedure is presented in this paper to aid engineers in designing this new type of PCP-strengthened RC column and to ensure proper strengthening details for desirable performance. The proposed design procedure consists of five parts: (1) the estimation of the ultimate load capacity of the strengthened column, (2) the design of the initial pre-camber displacement of the steel plate, (3) the design of the vertical spacing of the bolts, (4) the design of the bearing ends of the steel plates, and (5) the calculation of the tightening force of the bolts.

The controller of the system design includes different sub-parts such as system initial condition parameters, EB optimal algorithm, fuzzy controller, stability analysis and sensor actuator. The advantage of the design is that for continuous systems with polytypic uncertainties, the integrated H2/Hc robust output strategy with modified criterion is derived by asymptotically\r\nadjusting design parameters. Numerical verification of the time domain and the frequency domain shows that the novel system design provides precise prediction and control of the structural displacement response, which is necessary for the active control structure in the fuzzy model. Due to genetic algorithm (GA), we use a hierarchical conditions of the Hurwitz matrix test technique and the limits of average performance, Hierarchical Fitness Function Structure (HFFS).

Waste glass after grinding was used as a partial replacement of the cement with a percentage of 15%. The plastic waste was cut and introduced as fibers with 1% by the total volume of the mixture. Mechanical and durability tests were conducted for various mixtures of concrete as compressive and flexural strengths, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and acid attack. Also, other in-depth analyses were performed on samples of each variant such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (DSC-TGA), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the addition of glass powder or plastic fibers or a combination of both in concrete improved in the compression and flexural strengths in the long term. The highest compressive strength was obtained in the mix which combines the two wastes about 26.72% of increase compared to the control concrete. The flexural strength increased in the mixture containing the glass powder. Therefore, the mixture with two wastes exhibits better resistance to aggressive sulfuric acid attack, and incorporating glass powder improves the ultrasonic pulse velocity.",

The ambient vibration tests are conducted using initial candidate sensor locations at the beginning of the study. Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition and Stochastic Subspace Identification methods are used to extract experimental dynamic characteristics. Then, measurements are repeated according to optimal sensor locations of the dams. These locations are specified using the Effective Independence Method. To determine the optimal sensor locations, the target mode shape matrices which are obtained from ambient vibration tests of the selected dam with a large number of accelerometers are used. The dynamic characteristics obtained from each ambient vibrations tests are compared with each other. It is concluded that the dynamic characteristics obtained from initial measurements and those obtained from a limited number of sensors are compatible with each other. This situation indicates that optimal sensor placements determined by the Effective Independence Method are useful for dynamic characteristics identification of arch dams.",

The influence of target void and TiO2 content on the void ratio, compressive strength, sound-absorption, and NOx-removal performances of the samples was explored through compressive strength, void ratio, sound-absorption, and NOx-removal performance tests. The test results indicated that the sound-absorption and NOx-removal performances of the concrete samples were greatly influenced by the total void ratio, and the NOx-removal efficiency of the concrete samples was further promoted with an increase in the TiO2 content. These coupled effects were possibly attributed to the fact that the photocatalytic reaction is surface-oriented and can be affected by an increase in the total void ratio, increasing the available number of TiO2 particles on the surface that can facilitate the photocatalytic reaction when exposed to light.",

    "abstract": "Balanced cantilever construction is extensively used in the construction of prestressed concrete (PSC) box-girder bridges. Shear-lag effect is usually considered in finished bridges, while the cumulative shear-lag effect in bridges during balanced cantilever construction is considered only rarely. In this paper, based on the balanced cantilever construction sequences of large-span PSC box-girder bridges, the difference method is employed to analyze the cumulative shear-lag effect of box girders with varying depth under the concrete segments\\' own weight. During cantilever construction, no negative shear-lag effect is generated, and the cumulative shear-lag effect under the balanced construction procedure is greater than the instantaneous shear-lag effect in which the full dead weight is applied to the entire cantilever. Three cross-sections of Jianjiang Bridge were chosen for the experimental observation of shear-lag effect, and the experimental results are in keeping with the theoretical results of cumulative shear-lag effect. The research indicates that only calculating the instantaneous shear-lag effect is not sufficiently safe for practical engineering purposes.",

    "abstract": "Very limited studies have been accomplished concerning the historical structures around Harran area. Collected mortar samples from the historic structures in the area were tested to explore their mechanical, chemical and mineralogical properties. Mortar samples from three different points of each historical structure were taken and specified in accordance with the related standards taking into consideration their mechanical, chemical and mineralogical properties. By means of SEM-EDX the presence of organic fibres and calcite, quartz, plagioclase and muscovite minerals has been examined. Additionally, by means of XRF analysis, oxide (SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3) percentages of mortar ingredients have been specified, also. According to the test results obtained, it was confirmed that the mortars had densities ranging between 1.51-2.10 g/cm3, porosity values ranging between 8.89-35.38% and compressive strengths ranging between 5.02-5.90 MPa. \r\nSpecimen HU, which has the highest durability and lowest water absorption and porosity, was the mortar taken from the most intact building in the mosque complex. This result is most likely due to the very little fine aggregate content of HU. In contrast, HUC mortars with a small amount of fine particles and brick contents yielded slightly lower compressive strengths. The interesting point of this study is the mineralogical analysis results and especially the presence of ettringite in these historic mortars linked to the use of pozzolanic materials. Survival of these historic structures in Harran Area through centuries of use and, also, having been subjected to many earthquakes can probably be explained by these properties of the mortars.",

The steel-concrete composite connections were subjected to combined constant axial load and lateral cyclic displacements. Tests were carried out on four full-scale connections extracted from a real project engineering with different levels of axial force. The effect of steel layouts on the mechanical behavior of the transition connections was evaluated by failure modes, hysteretic behavior, backbone curves, displacement ductility, energy dissipation capacity and stiffness degradation. Test results showed that different steel layouts led to significantly different failure modes. For CFST-RC transition specimens, the circular cracks of the concrete at the RC column base was followed by steel yielding at the bottom of the CFST column. While uncoordinated deformation could be observed between SRC and RC columns in SRC-RC transition specimens, the crushing and peeling damage of unconfined concrete at the SRC column base was more serious. The existences of I-shape steel and steel tube avoided the pinching phenomenon on the hysteresis curve, which was different from the hysteresis curve of the general reinforced concrete column. The hysteresis loops were spindle-shaped, indicating excellent seismic performance for these transition composite connections. The average values of equivalent viscous damping coefficients of the four specimens are 0.123, 0.186 and 0.304 corresponding to the yielding point, peak point and ultimate point, respectively. Those values demonstrate that the transition steel-concrete composite connections have great energy dissipating capacity. Based on the experimental research, a high-fidelity ABAQUS model was established to further study the influence of concrete strength, steel grade and longitudinal reinforcement ratio on the mechanical behavior of transition composite connections.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper, the fiber theory has been employed to model the reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams (DBs)\r\nconsidering the reinforcing steel bar-concrete interaction. To simulate numerically the behavior of materials, the uniaxial materials\\' constitutive laws have been employed for reinforcements and concrete and the bond stress-slip between the reinforcing steel bars and surrounding concrete are taken into account. Because of the high sensitivity of DBs to shear deformations, the Timoshenko beam theory has been applied. The shear stress-strain (S-SS) relationship has been defined by the modified compression field theory (MCFT) model. By modeling about 300 RC panels and employing a produced numerical database, a study has been carried out to show the sensitivity of the MCFT model. This is performed based on the multiple linear regression (MLR) models. The results of this research also illustrate how different parameters such as characteristic compressive\r\nstrength of concrete, yield strength of reinforcements and the percentages of reinforcements in different directions get involved in the shear behavior of RC panels without applying complex theories. Based on the results obtained from the analysis of the MCFT S-SS model, a relatively simplified numerical S-SS model has been proposed. Application of the proposed S-SS model in modeling and analyzing the considered samples indicates that there is a good agreement between the simulated and the experimental test results. The comparison between the proposed S-SS model and the MCFT model indicates that in addition to\r\nthe advantage of better accuracy, the main advantage of the proposed method is simplicity in application.",

The models are based on Fick\\'s second law that is commonly used for chloride diffusion. The latter is based on deterministic analyses involving the most influencing parameters such as distance of the concrete structure from the seaside, depth of steel concrete cover, ambient temperature, relative humidity and the water-cement ratio. However, a realistic corrosion initiation time cannot be estimated because of the uncertainties associated to the different parameters of the models. Therefore a reliability approach using FORM/SORM method has been applied to develop the proposed engineering models integrating a limit state function and a reliability index B. As a result, the corrosion initiation time is expressed by new exponential engineering models where the uncertainties are associated to the model parameters. The main emerging result is a realistic decision tool for corrosion planning inspection.",

    "abstract": "The influence of subsequent curing on the performance of fly ash contained mortar under steam curing was studied.\r\nMortar samples incorporated with different content (0%, 20%, 50% and 70%) of Class F fly ash under five typical subsequent curing conditions, including standard curing (ZS), water curing(ZW) under 25oC, oven-dry curing (ZD) under 60oC, frozen curing (ZF) under -10oC, and nature curing (ZN) exposed to outdoor environment were implemented. The unsteady chloride diffusion coefficient was measured by rapid chloride migration test (RCM) to analyze the influence of subsequent curing condition on the resistance to chloride penetration of fly ash contained mortar under steam curing. The compressive strength was\r\nmeasured to analyze the mechanical properties. Furthermore, the open porosity, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were examined to investigate the pore characteristics and phase composition of mortar. The results indicate that the resistance to chloride ingress and compressive strength of steam-cured mortar decline with the increase of fly ash incorporated, regardless of the subsequent curing condition. Compared to ZS, ZD and ZF lead to poor resistance to chloride penetration, while ZW and ZN show better performance. Interestingly, under different fly\r\nash contents, the declining order of compressive strength remains ZS>ZW>ZN>ZD>ZF. When the fly ash content is blow 50%, the open porosity grows with increase of fly ash, regardless of the curing conditions are diverse. However, if the replacement amount of fly ash exceeds a certain high proportion (70%), the value of open porosity tends to decrease. Moreover, the main phase composition of the mortar hydration products is similar under different curing conditions, but the declining order of the CS-H gels and ettringite content is ZS>ZD>ZF. The addition of fly ash could increase the amount of harmless pores at early age.",

As these different techniques have to be compared on a level playing field, tensile coupon tests have been carried out initially for GFRP, CFRP and ferrocement and the number of layers required in each of these composites in terms of the tensile strength. It was found that for the selected constituents of the composites, one layer of CFRP was equivalent to three layers of GFRP and five layers of wiremesh reinforcement in ferrocement. Rehabilitation of RCC beams using these equivalent laminates shows that all the three composites performed in a similar way and are comparable. The parameters selected in this study were (i) the strengthening material and (ii) the level of pre-distress induced to the beams prior to the rehabilitation. It was noticed that, as the levels of pre-distress decreases, the percentage attainment of flexural capacity and flexural stiffness of the rehabilitated beams increases for all the three selected composites used for rehabilitation. Load-deflection behavior, failure modes, energy absorption capacity, displacement ductility and curvature ductility were compared among these composites and at different distress levels for each composite. The results indicate that ferrocement showed a better performance in terms of ductility than other FRPs, and between the FRPs, GFRP exhibited a better ductility than the CFRP counterpart.",

In this study, an effort was made to produce eco-friendly mortar mixes using geopolymer as binder and recycled fine aggregate (RFA) partially and study the resistance ability of these mortar mixes against the aggressive environments. To form the geopolymer binder, 70% fly ash, 30% ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and alkaline solution comprising of sodium silicate solution and 14M sodium hydroxide solution with a ratio of 1.5 were used. The ratio of alkaline liquid to binder (AL/B) was also considered as 0.4 and 0.6. In order to determine the resistance ability against aggressive environmental conditions, acid attack test, sulphate attack test and rapid chloride permeability test were conducted. Change in mass, change in compressive strength of the specimens after the immersion in acid/sulphate solution for a period of 28, 56, 90 and 120 days has been presented and discussed in this study. Results indicated that the incorporation of RFA leads to the reduction in compressive strength. Even though strength reduction was observed, eco-friendly mortar mixes containing geopolymer as binder and RFA as fine aggregate performed better when it was produced with AL/B ratio of 0.6.",

Four different sizes of river sands were considered. Using river sand instead of micro silica sand increased the flowability, and decreased the yield stress and plastic viscosity in rheological properties, and the effect was higher with larger particle size of river sand. It was demonstrated by analyses based on the packing density. In the results of compressive strength and elastic modulus, even though river sand was\r\nnot as good as micro silica sand, it could provide high strength of over 170 MPa and elastic modulus greater than 40 GPa. The difference in compressive strength depending on the size of river sand was explained with the concept of maximum paste thickness based on the packing density of aggregate. The flexural performance with river sand also presented relatively lower resistance than micro silica sand, and the reduction was greater with larger particle size of river sand. The flexural performance was proven to be also influenced by the difference in the fiber orientation distribution due to the size of river sand.",

Three parameters were considered in this test: (a) high temperatures (i.e., 20oC, 200oC, 400oC, 600oC, 800oC); (b) concrete strength (i.e., C60, C70, C80); (c) anchorage length (i.e., 250 mm, 400 mm). A total of 17 SRHC specimens subjected to high temperatures were designed for push out test. The load-slip curves at the loading end and free end were obtained, the influence of various variation parameters on the ultimate bond strength and residual bond strength was analyzed, in addition, the influence of elevated temperatures on the invalidation mechanism was researched in details. Test results show that the shapes of load-slip curves at loading ends and free ends are similar. The ultimate bond strength and residual bond strength of SRHC decrease first and then recover partly with the temperature increasing. The bond strength is proportional to the concrete strength, and the bond strength is proportional to the anchoring length when the temperature is low, while the opposite situation occurs when the temperature is high. What\\'s more, the bond damage of specimens with lower temperature develops earlier and faster than the specimens with higher temperature. From these experimental findings, the bond-slip constitutive formula of SRHC subjected to elevated temperatures is proposed, which fills well with test data.",

    "abstract": "High performance sandcretes (HPS) are new concretes characterized by particles having a diameter less than 5 mm,\r\nas well as very high mechanical strength and durability. This work consists in finding solutions to make sandcretes with good physico-mechanical and durability properties for this new generation of micro-concrete. However, upgrading ordinary sandcrete into high performance sandcrete (HPS) requires a thorough study of formulation parameters (equivalent water/binder ratio, type of cement and its dosage, kind and amount of super plasticizer, and gravel/sand ratio). This research study concerns the\r\nformulation, characterization and durability, in a sulphate environment, of a high performance sandcrete (HPS), made from local materials. The obtained results show that the rheological properties of fresh concrete and mechanical strength differ with the mineralogy, density and grain size distribution of sands and silica fume used.",

    "abstract": "Several reinforced concrete structures that get deteriorated by rebar corrosion are retrofitted using Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). When rebar comes in direct contact with CFRP, rebar may corrode, as iron is more active than carbon. Progression of corrosion of rebar in strengthened RC structures has been carried out when rebar comes in direct contact with CFRP. The experimentation is carried out in two phases. In phase I, corrosion of bare steel bar is monitored by making its\r\ncontact with CFRP. In phase II, concrete specimens with surface bonded CFRP were casted and subjected to the realistic exposure conditions keeping direct contact between rebar and CFRP. Progression of corrosion has been monitored by various parameters: Half-cell potential, Tafel extrapolation and Linear Polarisation Resistance. On termination of exposure, to find residual bond stress between rebar and concrete, pull-out test was performed. Rebar in contact with CFRP has shown substantially higher corrosion. The level of corrosion will be more with more area of contact.",

The results showed that SDA can defer the reaction of cement hydration and prolong the setting times of cement paste. This was very much pronounced on the flexural and splitting tensile strengths at 90 days of curing which are 36 % and 33 % higher than the control strengths, respectively. The study has proposed strength relations of mortar compressive strength with the flexural and splitting tensile strengths and these are, 5 and 7 times respectively. The flexural strength is 1.5 times that of the splitting tensile. Finally, linear models were developed on these relationships.",

At first, web openings reduce the self-weight of the girder, and also diffuse prestressing tendon anchorages. The reduced end anchoring forces decrease the web thickness of the end sections. Additionally, precast technology help to improve the quality of concrete and to reduce the construction period at the site. For experimentally verification, two 50 m full-scale H-IPC girders are manufactured with different concrete strength of 55 MPa and 80 MPa. The safety, stiffness, ductility, serviceability and crack development of H-IPC girder are measured and compared with each other for different strengths. Both girders show enough strength to carry live load and good stiffness to satisfy the design criteria. The experimental result shows the advantages of using high strength concrete and adopting precast girder. The test data can be used as a criterion for safety control and maintenance of the H-IPC girder.",

In order to improve the efficiency of the new sequence by reducing the number of prestressing stages per span, two solutions are suggested in this study.

Axial column shortening is due to the combined effect of elastic and inelastic deformations, shrinkage and creep. This study aims to investigate the effects of ambient temperature, relative humidity, cement hardening speed and aggregate type on concrete column shortening. The investigation was conducted using a column shortening prediction model which is underpinned by the Eurocode 2. Critical analysis and evaluation of the results showed that the concrete aggregate types used in the concrete have significant impact on column shortening. Generally, aggregates with higher moduli of elasticity hold the best results in terms of shortening. Cement type used is another significant factor, as using slow hardening cement gives better results compared to rapid hardening cement. This study also showed that environmental factors, namely, ambient temperature and relative humidity have less impact on column shortening.",

But it is one of the major CO2 emitters all over the world, during manufacturing (900 kg of CO2 per 1000 kg). Some of the modern construction methods aim at reducing the amount of usage of cement and came out with numerous solutions for replacement of the same. One such supplement in current trend is the Steel dust or the Electric Arc Furnace Dust (EAFD), which is a waste product from the electric arc furnace when the scrap metal is melted. When the concrete containing steel dust is exposed to atmosphere, the environmental oxygen and moisture play role to form rust and ultimately the member becomes harder. As Cement is the binder of conventional concrete, only certain percentage of the same could be replaced by the new material, steel dust. Tests were conducted for the 28 days cube strength of M45 grade (suitable for prestressing) concrete which has 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% steel dust instead cement. From the test, the optimum percentage replacement of steel dust was obtained, for which the beams and overhead poles were cast, prestressed and tested for the failure load and deflections. A conventional concrete beam and overhead pole were also cast, prestressed and tested to compare the results with those of the beam and pole that contained steel dust. The load vs. deflection plot and other results from the test is also discussed.",

Small dosages of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or polypropylene (PP) microfibers; 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2% by weight of cement; were added either separately or simultaneously into cement mortar. The experimental results show the ability of these additives to enhance the mechanical behavior of the mortar. The best improvement in compressive and flexural strengths of cement mortar reaches 28% in the case of adding a combination of 0.1% CNTs and 0.2% PP fibers for compression, and a combination of 0.2% CNTs and 0.2% PP fibers for flexure. Adding CNTs does not change the brittle mode of failure of plain mortar whereas the presence of PP fibers changes it into ductile failure and clearly enhances the fracture energy of the specimens. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of the fracture surfaces highlights the role of CNTs in improving the adhesion between the PP fibers and the hydration products and thus enhance the ability of the fibers to mitigate cracks propagation and to enhance the mechanical performance of the mortar.",

It is an efficient mineral admixture that has activated pozzolanic properties through high-temperature heating and rapid cooling. The purpose of this study is to improve a curb mixture that can reduce NOx outside and investigate durability performance. To this end, mortar curb specimens were manufactured by replacing OPC with ACT. The ACT substitution ratios of 0.0, 10.0, and 25.0% were considered, and mechanical and durability tests on the curb specimens were conducted at 28 and 91 days of age. Steam curing was carried out for three days for the production of curbs, which was very effective to strength development at early ages. The reduction in strength at early ages could be compensated through this process, and no significant performance degradation was evaluated in the tests on chloride attack, carbonation, and freezing and thawing. The mortar curb with an ACT of 10.0~25.0% replacement ratio exhibited clear NOx reduction through photocatalytic (TiO2) treatment. This is due to the increase in physical absorption through surface absorption and the photocatalyst-containing TiO2 coating. In this study, the reasonable range of the ACT replacement ratio for NOx reduction was quantitatively evaluated through a comprehensive analysis of each test.",

The field test was implemented to monitor the secondary lining due to the significant cracking behaviors influenced the stability and health of the tunnel structure. Surface strain gauges were installed for monitoring the status of crack openings, and the monitoring outputs demonstrated that the cracks were still in the developing stage. Additionally, adjacent tunnel and poor condition of surrounding rock were identified as the causes of the lining cracking by systematically characterizing the crack spatial distribution, tunnel site and surrounding rock conditions. Reconstruction of partial lining and reconstruction of the whole secondary lining were designed as the maintenance projects for different cracking regions based on the construction feasibility. For assessing the health conditions of the reinforced lining, embedded strain gauges were set up to continuously measure the strain and the internal force of the reconstructed structures. For the partially reconstructed lining, the outputs show the maximum tensile elongation is 0.018 mm during 227 days, which means the structure has no obvious deformation after maintenance. The one-year monitoring of fullsection was implemented in the other two completely reconstructed cross-sections by embedded strain gauge. The outputs show the reconstructed secondary lining has undertaken the pressure of surrounding rock with the time passing. According to the calculated compressive and tensile safety factors, the completely reconstructed lining has been in reliable and safe condition during the past year after reinforcement. It can conclude that the aforementioned maintenance projects can effectively ensure the stability and health of this tunnel.",

Crumb rubber (CR) from waste tyre is an alternative for sand replacement in low strength\r\napplications. Many researchers have studied CR cement-based materials produced by normal mixing (NM) method and reported a significant decrease in compressive strength due to CR. To compensate this strength loss, this research aims to study the innovative incorporation of CR in cement composite via the preplaced mixing (PM) method. In this investigation, cement composite was produced with NM and PM methods by replacing sand with 0%, 50%, and 100% CR by volume. The test results showed no significant difference in terms of densities of cement composite prepared with both mixing methods. However, cement composite prepared with PM method had lower strength reduction (about 10%) and lowered drying shrinkage (about 20%). In addition, the sound absorption coefficient and noise reduction coefficient of CR cement composite prepared by PM method were in similar range as those prepared with NM method. Overall, the results demonstrate that the PM method is promising, and the maximum replacement level of 50% is recommended for CR in the cement composite.",

These types of concrete elements as prefabricated parts have an abundance of applications in the construction industry which is the most used in the construction of tunnels in squeezing grounds, tunnel passwords from fault zones or swelling soils as soft supports. HDC elements after reaching to compressive yield stress, in nonlinear behavior have hardening combined with increasing strain and compressive strength. The main aim of this laboratory and numerical research is to construct concrete elements with the above properties so the compressive stress-strain behavior of different concrete elements with four categories of mix designs have been discussed and finally one of them has been defined as HDC element mix design. Furthermore, two columns with and without implementing of HDC elements have been made and stress-strain curves of them have been investigated experimentally. An analysis model is presented for columns using finite element method adopted by ABAQUS. The results obtained from the ABAQUS finite element method are compared with experimental data. The main comparison is made for stress-strain curve. The stress-strain curves from the finite element method agree well with experimental results. The results show that the dimension of the HDC samples is significant in the stress-strain behavior. The use of the element greatly increases energy absorption and ductility.",

Furtheremore experimental test and Particle flow code in two dimension (PFC2D) have been used. concrete samples with dimension of 50 mmx50 mmx100 mm were prepared. Tensile strength of model material was 1 MPa. Within the specimen, three Z shape non-persistent notches were provided. The notch length was 1.5 cm. when two upper and lower notch have horizontal direction, the middle joint angle were 45o, 90o and 135o. When dips of two upper and lower notch was 90o, the middle joint angle were 45o, 90o and 135o degree. When dips of two upper and lower notch was 135 degree, the middle joint angle were 45o, 90o and 135o. Totally, 9 different configuration systems were prepared for Z shape non-persistent joints. Also, 37 models with different Z shape non-persistent notch angle were prepared in numerical model. The axial load with rate of 0.005 mm/s was applied to the model. Results indicated that the failure process was mostly governed by the Z shape non-persistent joint angle. The compressive strengths of the specimens were related to the fracture pattern and failure mechanism of the discontinuities. In addition it was shown that the compresssive behaviour of discontinuities is depend on the number of the induced tensile cracks which are increased by increasing the middle joint angle. The middle joint has significant effect on the failure pattern. In fixed upper and lower joints angles, when the middle joint angle is 90o the failure stress has maximum value. On the other hand, it has minimum value when the middle joint angle was 135o. In fixed middle joint angle, the samples have minimum value when the upper and lower joints angles are 135o. At the end, the failure pattern and strength results of the experiential tests and the numerical simulations were similar.",

    "abstract": "This article has been devoted to investigate the dynamic response of a graphene oxide powder (GOP) reinforced\r\nbeam exposed to blast and thermal loads. It is assumed that the blast load has been exerted on the top surface of the beam. The material modeling of GOP-reinforced composite has been performed assuming two types of GOP distribution called uniform and graded in thickness direction. The establishment of the governing equations has been done employing a refined shear deformation beam theory and the consideration of elastic foundation. Finally, the equations have been solved implementing Chebyshev-Ritz method and inverse Laplace transform method. Then, the time history of the beam has been derived and its dependency on GOP percentage, GOP distribution, temperature rise, blast load factor, foundation coefficient band load position.",

    "abstract": "During past decades fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets have been externally bonded to structural elements to\r\nincrease their axial, shear, or bending capacity. FRP bars also have been widely used to replace the steel reinforcements in columns subjected to a harsh environment. In this study, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips were used as the transverse reinforcement for concrete columns. Although FRP bars have already been used as the transverse reinforcement in concrete columns, the efficiency and feasibility of CFRP strips have not been investigated. CFRP strips are flexible; therefore, they can be easily shaped as spirals to confine the concrete core of columns. The efficiency of CFRP strips for the confinement\r\nof the concrete core was examined through a series of quasi-static cyclic tests on four full-scale columns that had similar size\r\nand longitudinal reinforcements. One of the columns was selected as the reference, and steel spirals transversally reinforced it.\r\nCFRP strips transversally reinforced the other three columns with different widths and spacing. The obtained results showed that\r\nthe number of cracks in the CFRP-confined columns was less than the reference column. The length of cracks in the CFRPconfined\r\ncolumns was also relatively shorter. Besides, the CFRP-confined columns had a larger ultimate load, effective yield\r\nstrength, and displacement ductility ratio compared with the reference column.",

It has lot of rewards over ordinary concrete i.e., enrichment in production, cutback in manpower, brilliant retort to load and vibration along with improved durability. In the present study, the mechanical strength of CM-2 (SCC containing 10% of rice husk ash (RHA) as cement replacement and 600 grams of glass fibers per cubic meter) was investigated at various dosages of cement replacement by fly ash (FA) and GGBS. A total of 17 SCC mixtures including two control SCC mixtures (CM-1 and CM-2) were developed for investigating fresh and hardened properties in which, ten ternary cementitious blends of SCC by blending OPC+RHA+FA, OPC+RHA+GGBS and five quaternary cementitious blends (OPC+RHA+FA+GGBS) at different replacement dosages of FA and GGBS were developed with reference to CM-2. For constant water-cement ratio (0.42) and dosage of SP (2.5%), the addition of glass fibers (600 grams/m3) in CM-1 i.e., CM-2 shows lower workability but higher mechanical strength. While fly ash based ternary blends (OPC+RHA+FA) show better workability but lower mechanical strength as FA content increases in comparison to GGBS based ternary blends (OPC+RHA+GGBS) on increasing GGBS content. The pattern for mixtures appeared to exhibit higher workablity as that of the concentration of FA+GGBS rises in quaternary blends (OPC+RHA+FA+GGBS). A decrease in compressive strength at 7-days was noticed with an increase in the percentage of FA and GGBS as cement replacement in ternary and quaternary blended mixtures with respect to CM-2. The highest 28-days compressive strength (41.92 MPa) was observed for mix QM-3 and the lowest (33.18 MPa) for mix QM-5.",

    "abstract": "The overuse level of cement for civil industry has several undesirable social and ecological consequences. Substitution of cement with industrial wastes, called by-products, such as fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, silica fume, metakaoline, rice husk ash, etc. as the mineral admixtures offers various advantages such as technical, economical and environmental which are very important in the era of sustainability in construction industry. The paper presents the experimental investigations for assessing the mechanical properties of the concrete made using the Pozzolanic waste materials (supplementary cementitious materials) such as fly ash and silica fume as the cement replacing materials. These materials were used in eight trial mixes with varying amount of ordinary Portland cement. These SCMs were kept in equal proportions in all the eight trial mixes. The chemical admixture (High Range Water Reducing Admixture) was also added to improve the workability of concrete. The compressive strengths for 7, 28, 40 and 90 days curing were evaluated whereas the flexural and tensile strengths corresponding to 7, 28 and 40 days curing were evaluated. The study corroborates that the Pozzolanic materials used in the present investigation as partial replacement for cement can render the sustainable concrete which can be used in the rigid pavement construction.",

And the main aim of this present paper is to examine the dynamic characteristics and damage evaluation of undamaged and damaged HYFRC beams under free-free constraints. In this experimental work, totally four RC beams were cast and analyzed in order to evaluate the dynamic behavior as well as static load behavior of HYFRCs. Hybrid fiber reinforced concrete beams have been cast by incorporating two different fibers such as steel and polypropylene (PP). Damage of HYFRC beams was obtained by cracking of concrete for one of the beams in each set under four-point bending tests with different percentage variation of damage levels as 50%, 70% and 90% of maximum ultimate load. And the main dynamic characteristics such as damping, fundamental natural frequencies, mode shapes and frequency response function at each and every damage level has been assessed by means of non-destructive technique (NDT) with hammer excitation. The fundamental natural frequency and damping values obtained through dynamic tests for HYFRC beams were compared with control (reference) RC beam at each level of damage which has been acquired through static tests. The static experimental test results emphasize that the HYFRC beam has attained higher ultimate load as compared with control reinforced concrete beam.",

Secondly, pitting factor model of rebar in general descend law with corrosion degree was introduced in terms of existing experimental data. Finally, with the comprehensive numerical simulation, the durability of an existing arch bridge was studied in depth in deterministic way, including diffusion process and sectional strength of typical cross section of arch, crossbeam and deck slab. Evolution of structural capacity considering life-cycle rehabilitation strategy indicated the degradation law of durability of reinforced arch bridges.",

The seismic performance and deformation capacity of three reinforced high-strength concrete filled Polyvinyl Chloride tube (RHCPVCT) short columns and one reinforced high-strength concrete (RHC), under pseudo-static tests (PSTs) with vertical axial force was evaluated. The main design parameters of the columns in the tests were the axial compression ratio, confinement type, concrete strength, height-diameter ratio of PVCT. The failure modes, hysteretic curves, skeleton curves of short columns were presented and analyzed. Placing PVCT in the RHC column could be remarkably improved the ultimate strength and energy dissipation of columns. However, no fiber element models have been formulated for computing the seismic responses of RHCPVCT columns with PVT tubes filled with high-strength concrete. Nonlinear finite element method (FEM) was conducted to predict seismic behaviors. Finite element models were verified through a comparison of FEM results with experimental results. A parametric study was then performed using validated FEM models to investigate the effect of several parameters on the mechanical properties of RHC-PVCT short columns.

    "abstract": "Chloride corrosion has become the main factor of reducing the service life of reinforced concrete structures. The object of this paper is to propose a theoretical model that predicts the service life of chloride-corrosive concrete under fatigue load. In the process of modeling, the concrete is divided into two parts, microcrack and matrix. Taking the variation of mcirocrack area caused by fatigue load into account, an equation of chloride diffusion coefficient under fatigue load is established, and then the predictive model is developed based on Fick\\'s second law. This model has an analytic solution and is reasonable in comparison to previous studies. Finally, some factors (chloride diffusion coefficient, surface chloride concentration and fatigue parameter) are analyzed to further investigate this model. The results indicate: the time to pit-to-crack transition and time to crack growth should not be neglected when predicting service life of concrete in strong corrosive condition; the type of fatigue loads also has a great impact on lifetime of concrete. In generally, this model is convenient to predict service life of chloride-corrosive concrete with different water to cement ratio, under different corrosive condition and under different types of fatigue load.",

    "abstract": "When designing reinforced concrete (RC) members, the rebar is assumed to resist all tensile forces, but the resistance of the concrete in the tension area is neglected. However, concrete can also resist tensile forces and increase the tensile stiffness of RC members, which is called the tension stiffening effect (TSE). Therefore, this study assessed the TSE, particularly after yielding of the steel bars and the effects of the steel ratio on the TSE. For this purpose, RC member specimens with steel ratios of 2.87%, 0.99%, and 0.59% were fabricated for uniaxial tensile tests. A vision-based non-contact measurement system was used to measure the behavior of the specimens. The cracks on the specimen at the stabilized cracking stage and the fracture stage were measured with the image analysis method. The results show that the number of cracks increases as the steel ratio increases. The reductions of the limit state and fracture strains were dependent on the ratio of the rebar. As the steel ratio decreased, the strain after yielding of the RC members significantly decreased. Therefore, the overall ductility of the RC member is reduced with decreasing steel ratio. The yielding plateau and ultimate load of the RC members obtained from the proposed equations showed very good agreement with those of the experiments. Finally, the image analysis method was possible to allow flexibility in expand the measurement points and targets to determine the strains and crack widths of the specimens.",

    "abstract": "The use of spliced reinforcing bars in sustainable concrete members to manage inadequate bars length is a common practical issue which is may be due to some limitations. The lap splicing means two bars overlapped in parallel with specified length called the splice length in order to provide the required bond between the two bars. The bond between sustainable concrete and spliced steel bars is another important issue. The normal strength sustainable concrete specimens of sizes 1700x150x150 mm with tension reinforcement lap spliced were selected according to testing device length limitations. These members were designed to fail in flexure in order to investigate the lap spliced tension bars effect. The selected lap spliced\r\ntension bars were of 10 mm size with smooth and deformed surfaces in order to investigate the surface nature accompanied with the splice nature. The sustainable concrete mechanical properties and mix workability were also studied. This study reveals that the effect of number of spliced bars on the response of beams reinforced with smooth bars is found to be more obvious than deformed one. Finite element modeling in three dimensions was carried out for the tested beams using ABAQUS software. A parametric study is carried out using finite elements on considering the following parameters, concrete compressive strength, load type and opening in cross section (hollow section) for weight reduction purposes.The laboratory and numerical results show good agreements in terms of ultimate load and deflection with an average difference of 10% and 15% in ultimate load and deflection respectively.",

Test results showed that the strain and curvature of the columns increased with time, and concrete forces were gradually transferred to longitudinal bars due to the creep and shrinkage of concrete. The long-term behavior of the columns varied with the test parameters, and long-term effects were more pronounced in the case of using the lower strength concrete, lower strength steel, lower bar ratio, fewer loading-step, higher eccentricity ratio, and higher slenderness ratio. However, in all the columns, no longitudinal bars were yielded under service loads at the final measuring day.

    "abstract": "Employment of the wave propagation approach with the combination of Pasternak foundation equation gives birth\r\nto the shell frequency equation. Mathematically, the integral form of the Lagrange energy functional is converted into a set of three partial differential equations. A cylindrical shell is placed on the elastic foundation of Pasternak. For isotropic materials, the\r\nphysical properties are same everywhere, whereas the laminated and functionally graded materials, they vary from point to point. Here the shell material has been taken as functionally graded material. The influence of the elastic foundation, wave number, length and height-to-radius ratios is investigated with different boundary conditions. The frequencies of length-to-radius and height-to-radius ratio are counter part of each other. The frequency first increases and gain maximum value in the midway of the shell length and then lowers down for the variations of wave number. It is found that due to inducting the elastic foundation of Pasternak, the frequencies increases. It is also exhibited that the effect of frequencies is investigated by varying the surfaces with stainless steel and nickel as a constituent material. MATLAB software is utilized for the vibration of functionally graded\r\ncylindrical shell with elastic foundation of Pasternak and the results are verified with the open literature.",

A 3D finite element (FE) model was built for heat transfer analysis using software ABAQUS. Based on the temperature distribution obtained from the FE analysis, the residual axial compressive load bearing capacity of RC columns was worked out using the section method. Formulas for calculating the residual axial compressive load bearing capacity of the columns after fire exposure and the axial compressive load bearing capacity of postfire columns retrofitted with CFRP sheets were developed. Then the Monte Carlo method was used to analyze the reliability of the axial compressive load bearing capacity of the RC columns retrofitted with CFRP sheets using a code developed in MATLAB. The effects of fire exposure time, load ratio, number of CFRP layers, concrete cover thickness, and longitudinal reinforcement ratio on the reliability of the axial compressive load bearing capacity of the columns after fire were investigated. The results show that within 60 minutes of fire exposure time, the reliability index of the RC columns after retrofitting with two layers of CFRPs can meet the requirements of Chinese code GB 50068 (GB 2001) for safety level II. This method is effective and accurate for the reliability analysis of the axial load bearing capacity of postfire reinforced concrete columns retrofitted with CFRP.",

Improvements in compressive and flexural strengths obtained for HPFRC are moderate and significant, respectively, Empirical equations developed for the compressive strength and flexural strength of HPFRC as a function of fiber volume fraction. A relation between flexural strength and compressive strength of HPFRC with R=0.78 was developed. Due to the complex mix proportions and non-linear relationship between the mix proportions and properties, models with reliable predictive capabilities are not developed and also research on HPFRC was empirical. In this paper due to the inadequacy of present method, a back propagation-neural network (BP-NN) was employed to estimate the 28-day compressive strength of HPFRC mixes. BP-NN model was built to implement the highly non-linear relationship between the mix proportions and their properties. This paper describes the data sets collected, training of ANNs and comparison of the experimental results obtained for various mixtures. On statistical analyses of collected data, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model with R2=0.78 was developed for the prediction of compressive strength of HPFRC mixes, and average absolute error (AAE) obtained is 6.5%. On validation of the data sets by NNs, the error range was within 2% of the actual values. ANN model has given the significant degree of accuracy and reliability compared to the MLR model. ANN approach can be effectively used to estimate the 28-day compressive strength of fibrous concrete mixes and is practical.",

This investigation focuses on the properties of alkali-activated mortar with the different replacement ratios of ceramic tile powder (CTP) by fine soil powder (FSP) (0 to 100)% and different molarities of sodium hydroxide concentrations. The experimental program was conducted by examining the compressive strength, water absorption, and water sorptivity.

Also, minimum water absorption at the age of 90 days was found in the mixes containing 100% fine soil powder. However, fine soil powder replacement had a negative effect on the sorptivity and water absorption values at the age of 120 days.

The steel fiber used is set at 0.5% of the concrete volume. The phenomenon of the test results shows that although the beams were tested to achieve shear failure, the fact that all the tested beams did not encounter any shear failure. It has shown the influence of steel fibers and stirrups that plays a role in determining the mode of collapse. The concrete shear capacity of steel fibrous concrete beams installed with stirrups in altered spacing variations is not significantly different from each other, while beam deformability increases when the space stirrups are reduced.

The objective of this study is to quantify the damage of Shear Wall Reinforced Concrete Frames (SWRCFs) based on pushover analysis as a procedure that can reflect the behavior of structures from elastic to collapse. For this purpose, firstly, several SWRCFs are designed and the capacity spectrum of each one is achieved via pushover analysis. After that, the static damage indices of the designed frames are obtained. Then, nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed on these frames and the Park and Ang damage index as the basis damage criterion is achieved. Afterward, some relations are presented to predict the dynamic damage of these frames via pushover analysis. Eventually, to confirm the validity of the proposed relations, the values of Park and Ang damage index of three new SWRCFs are acquired once utilizing nonlinear dynamic analysis and again applying the introduced relations.

In addition, the relationship between the thixotropy behavior and 3D concrete printing buildability was derived by proposing a measurement method that simulates the 3D concrete printing buildup process. The analysis of the tendency of the thixotropy behavior according to the resting time revealed that the area of the hysteresis loop (AHyst) showed a tendency to increase and then converge as the resting time increased, which means hysteresis loop approach critical resting time for sufficient buildability. In the thixotropy behavior analysis that simulates the 3D concrete printing buildup process, the buildup ratio, which is the recovery rate of the shear stress, showed a tendency to increase and then converge as the resting time increased, which are similar results like hysteresis loop.

This study shows an optimization process that determines the optimal mixture of air-entrained slag blended concrete considering carbonation durability, frost durability, CO2 emission, and materials cost. First, the aim of optimization is set as total cost, which equals material cost plus CO2 emission cost. The constraints of optimization consist of strength, workability, carbonation durability with climate change, frost durability, range of components and component ratio, and absolute volume. A genetic algorithm is used to\r\ndetermine optimal mixtures considering aim function and various constraints. Second, mixture design examples are shown considering four different cases, namely, mixtures without considering carbonation (Case 1), mixtures considering carbonation (Case 2), mixtures considering carbonation coupled with climate change (Case 3), and mixtures of high strength concrete (Case 4). The results show that the carbonization is the controlling factor of the mixture design of the concrete with ordinary strength (the designed strength is 30MPa). To meet the challenge of climate change, stronger concrete must be used. For high-strength slag blended concrete (design strength is 55MPa), strength is the control factor of mixture design.",

In fact, in order to ensure the safety of UHPC during construction and sufficient durability and long-term performance, it is necessary to explore the early behavior of UHPC. The test parameters (test control factors) investigated included the percentage of cement replaced by silica fume (SF), the percentage of cement replaced by ultrafine silica powder (SFP), the amount of steel fiber (volume percent), and the amount of polypropylene fiber (volume percentage). The engineering properties of UHPC in the fresh mixing stage and at the age of 7 days were investigated. These properties include freshly mixed properties (slump, slump flow, and unit weight) and hardened mechanical properties (compressive strength, elastic modulus, flexural strength, and splitting tensile strength). Moreover, the effects of the experimental factors on the performance of the tested UHPC were evaluated by range analysis and variance analysis. The experiment results showed that the compressive strength of the C8 mix at the age of 7 days was highest of 111.5 MPa, and the compressive strength of the C1 mix at the age of 28 days was the highest of 128.1 MPa. In addition, the 28-day compressive strength in each experimental group increased by 13%-34% compared to the 7-day compressive strength. In terms of hardened mechanical properties, the performance of each experimental group was superior to that of the control group (without fiber and\r\nwithout additional binder materials), with considerable improvement, and the experimental group did not produce explosive or brittle damage after the test. Further, the flexural test process found that all test specimens exhibited deflection-hardening behavior, resulting in continued to increase carrying capacity after the first crack.",

Experimental results showed that the AAM concretes had the energy absorption capacity lower than those of the SFC and OPC concretes because the descending parts of the whole stress-strain curves of the AAM concretes referred to the snap back mode different from the strain softening modes of those of the SFC and OPC concretes with the compressive strength graded at 30 or 40 MPa. Among three concretes with equivalent strength grades, the AAM concretes had the lowest elastic Young",

    "abstract": "Reinforced concrete vertical silos are universal structures that store large amounts of granular materials. Due to the asymmetric structure, heavy load, uneven storage material distribution, and the difference between the storage volume and the storage material bulk density, the corresponding earthquake is very complicated. Some scholars have proposed the calculation method of horizontal forces on reinforced concrete vertical silos under the action of earthquakes. Without considering the effect of torsional effect, this article aims to reveal the expansion factor of the silo group considering the torsional effect through experiments. Through two-way seismic simulation shaking table tests on reinforced concrete column-supported group silo structures, the basic dynamic characteristics of the structure under earthquake are obtained. Taking into account the torsional response, the structure has three types of storage: empty, half and full. A comprehensive analysis of the internal force conditions under the material conditions shows that: the different positions of the group bin model are different, the side bin displacement produces a displacement difference, and a torsional effect occurs; as the mass of the material increases, the structure",

However, in most retrofitting cases, the main target is the increase of the energy dissipation capacity. This paper studies numerically the efficiency of a specific strengthening methodology which utilizes a steel link element having a cross-section of various shapes, connected to the RC frame through bracing elements. The energy is dissipated through the yielding of the steel link element. The case studied is a typical one bay, single-storey RC frame, constructed according to older code provisions, which is strengthened through two different types of link elements. The presented numerical models are based on tests which are simulated in order to gain a better insight of the behaviour of the strengthened structures, but also in order to study the effects of different configurations for the link element. The behaviour of the strengthened frames is studied with respect to the one of the original bare frame. Moreover, the numerically obtained results are compared to the experimentally obtained ones, in order to verify the effectiveness of the applied simulation methodology.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the axial compressive performance of the recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) filled glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) tube and profile steel composite columns, static loading tests were carried out on 18 specimens under axial loads in this study, including 7 RAC filled GFRP tube columns and 11 RAC filled GFRP tube-profile steel composite columns. The design parameters include recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) replacement percentage, profile steel ratio, slenderness ratio and RAC strength. The failure process, failure modes, axial stress-strain curves, strain development and axial bearing capacity of all specimens were mainly analyzed in detail. The experimental results show that the GFRP tube had strong restraint ability to RAC material and the profile steel could improve the axial compressive performance of the columns. The failure modes of the columns can be summarized as follow: the profile steel in the composite columns yielded first, then the internal RAC material was crushed, and finally the fiberglass of the external GFRP tube was seriously torn, resulting in the final failure of columns. The axial bearing capacity of the columns decreased with the increase of RCA replacement percentage and the maximum decreasing amplitude was 11.10%. In addition, the slenderness ratio had an adverse effect on the axial bearing capacity of the columns. However, the strength of the RAC material could effectively improve the axial bearing capacity of the columns, but their deformability decreased. In addition, the increasing profile steel ratio contributed to the axial compressive capacity of the composite columns. Based on the above analysis, a formula for calculating the bearing capacity of composite columns under axial compression load is proposed, and the adverse effects of slenderness ratio and RCA replacement percentage are considered.",

    "abstract": "In evaluating explosion-protection capacity, safety distance is broadly accepted as the distance at which detonation of a given explosive causes acceptable structural damage. Safety distance can be calculated based on structural response under blast loading and damage criteria. For the applicability of the safety distance, the minimum required stand-off distance should be given when the explosive size is assumed. However, because of the nature of structures, structural details and material\r\ncharacteristics differ, which requires sensitivity analysis of the safety distance. This study examines the safety-distance sensitivity from structural and material property variations. For the safety-distance calculation, a blast analysis module based on the Kingery and Bulmash formula, a structural response module based on a Single Degree of Freedom model, and damage criteria based on a support rotation angle were prepared. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for the Reinforced Concrete oneway slab with different thicknesses, reinforcement ratios, reinforcement yield strengths, and concrete compressive strengths. It was shown that slab thickness has the most significant influence on both inertial force and flexure resistance, but the compressive strength of the concrete is not relevant.",

Lead-Rubber Bearing (LRB) is one of the most well-known separation systems which can be used in different types of structures. This system mitigates the earthquake acceleration prior to transferring to the structure efficiently. However, the performance of this system in concrete structures with different heights have not been evaluated thoroughly yet. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of LRB separation system\r\nin concrete structures with different heights. For this purpose, three, 16, and 23 story concrete structures are equipped by LRB and exposed to a far-field earthquake. Next, a time history analysis is conducted on each of the structures. Finally, the performance of the concrete structures is compared with each other in the term of their response to the earthquakes and the formation of plastic hinges. The results of the paper show that the rate of change in acceleration response and the ratio of drift along the height of 8 and 23 stories concrete structures are more than those of the 16-stories, and the use of LRB reduces the formation of plastic joints.",

    "abstract": "Geometric nonlinearity can significantly affect load-carrying capacity of slender columns. Dependence of structural stability on columns necessitates the consideration of second-order effects in the design process of columns, appropriately. On the whole, the design codes present a simplified procedure for second order analysis of slender columns. In this approximate method, the end moments of columns resulted from linear analysis (first-order) are multiplied by the recommended moment amplification factors of codes to achieve magnified moments of the second-order analysis. In the other approach, the equilibrium equations are directly solved for the deformed configuration of structure, so the resulting moments and deflections contain the influence of slenderness and increase more rapidly than do loads. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of moment amplification factors of Iranian national building code whose provisions are similar to the ACI requirement. Herein, finite element method is used to achieve magnified end moments of reinforced concrete moment resisting frames, and the outcomes are compared with the moments acquired based on the proposed approximate method by Iranian national building code. The results show that the approximate method of Iranian code for calculating magnified moments has significant errors for both unbraced and braced columns.",

For this purpose, concrete prisms of 100x100 mm cross section and 500 mm length having one central deformed steel re-bar were cast using fibrous and non-fibrous Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) with varying percentages of recycled aggregates (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) and tested under uniaxial tensile load. For all fibrous RAC mixes, polypropylene fibers were used at constant dosage of 3.15 kg/m3. Effect of recycled aggregates and fibers on the compressive strength of concrete was also explored in this study. Through studying tensile load versus global axial deformation of composite and strain development in concrete and steel, it was found that replacement of natural aggregates with recycled aggregates in concrete negatively affected the cracking load, tension stiffening and strain development, and this negative effect was observed to be increased with increasing contents of recycled aggregates in concrete. The results of this study showed that it was possible to minimize the negative effect of recycled aggregates in concrete by the addition of polypropylene fibers. Reinforced concrete element constructed using concrete containing 50% recycled aggregates and polypropylene fibers exhibited cracking behavior, tension stiffening and strain development response almost similar to that of concrete element constructed using natural aggregate concrete without fiber.",

To this end, the candidate components of RMs were selected considering the currently required properties of RMs. Limestone, slag, silica, and kaolin were selected as substitutes for cement, while glycerol and corn syrup were selected as matrix fluids. Moreover, distilled water was used for mixing. To select the combinations of materials that meet all the required properties of RMs, flow characteristics were first analyzed. The results revealed that silica and kaolin exhibited bilateral nonlinearity. When an analysis was conducted over time, slag exhibited chemical reactions, including strength development. Moreover, fungi were observed in all mixtures with corn syrup. On the other hand, the combination of limestone, glycerol, and water exhibited a performance that met all the required properties of RMs. Thus, limestone, glycerol, and water were selected as the components of the RMs. When the influence of each component of the RMs on flow characteristics was analyzed, it was found that limestone affects the yield value, while the ratio of water and glycerol affects the plastic viscosity. Based on this, it was possible to select the mixing ratios for the RMs that can simulate the flow characteristics of cement paste under each mixing ratio. This relationship was established as an equation, which was verified under various mixing ratios. Finally, when the flow characteristics were analyzed under various temperature conditions, cement paste and the RMs exhibited similar tendencies in terms of flow characteristics. This indicated that the combinations of the selected materials could be used as RMs that can simulate the flow characteristics of cement paste with constant quality under various mixing ratio conditions and construction environment conditions.",

The weight ratio and the most probable value were accordingly considered based on the properties of the shortening value analyzed at several points in each construction stage and the distance between these measured points and unmeasured points at which the shortening was predicted. The effective range and shortening value normalization were considered using the column grouping concept. These tools were applied to calculate the error ratio between the predicted and measured values on a floor where a measured point exists, and then determine the estimated error ratio and estimated error value for the unmeasured point using this error ratio. At points on a floor where no measured point exists, the estimated error ratio and the estimated error value were calculated by applying the most probable value considering the weight ratio for the nearest floor where measured points exist. In this manner, the error values and estimated error values can be determined at all points in a structure. Then, the analytical correction value, defined as this error or estimated error value, was applied by adding it to the predicted value.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop reference materials (RMs) for mortar that can simulate the initial flow characteristics with constant quality over a long period. Through the previous research on the development of RMs for cement paste, the combination of limestone, glycerol, and water was used as the basic matrix for developing RMs for mortar in this study. In addition, glass beads of three particle sizes (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm) and ISO standard sand were selected as tentative candidates to derive fine aggregate substitutes. The mixture of glass beads could simulate the initial flow characteristics of mortar, but under the same mixing ratio, replicates showed an unstable tendency to indicate inconsistent values due to the generation of electrostatic properties between materials and equipment. On the other hand, the mixture using ISO standard Sand not only simulates the constant flow characteristics for a long period of time, but also shows stable results with little error in replicates. Therefore, limestone, glycerol, ISO standard sand, and water were finally determined as components that met the required properties of RMs for mortar. The effect of each component on the flow characteristics of RMs was analyzed. It was found that\r\nglycerol increased the cohesion between the particles of standard sand, resulting in a constant increase both in the plastic viscosity and yield stress. Both limestone and standard sand had a dominant effect on the yield stress. The relationships between various mortar mixing ratios and the corresponding mixing ratios of RMs were established. In addition, the results of the verification experiment showed that the rheological properties of the RMs obtained through the relationships correlated with various water/cement ratios and the fine aggregate volume fractions of mortar obtained with same manner. In other words, the RMs for mortar developed in this study can be used as standard samples because they can simulate the initial flow characteristics of mortar of various mixing ratios for a long period without any chemical changes.",

Numerical analysis is performed to find the ultimate strength of HPC beams to compare with experimental results. Nonlinear behaviour of steel reinforcing bars and plain concrete is simulated using appropriate constitutive models and\r\nexperimental results.

    "abstract": "A new type of composite insulated concrete sandwich wall (ICS-wall), which is composed of a triangle truss steel wire network, an insulating layer, and internal and external concrete layers, is proposed. To study the mechanical properties of this new ICS-wall, tensile, compression, and shearing tests were performed on 22 specimens and tensile strength and corrosion resistance tests on 6 triangle truss joints. The variables in these tests mainly include the insulating plate material, the thickness of the insulating plate, the vertical distance of the triangle truss framework, the triangle truss layout, and the connecting mode between the triangle truss and wall and the material of the triangle truss. Moreover, the failure mode, mechanical properties, and bearing capacity of the wall under tensile, shearing, and compression conditions were analyzed. Research results demonstrate that the concrete and insulating layer of the ICS-wall are pulling out, which is the main failure mode under tensile conditions. The ICS-wall, which uses a graphite polystyrene plate as the insulating layer, shows better tensile properties than the wall with an ordinary polystyrene plate. The tensile strength and bearing capacity of the wall can be improved effectively by strengthening the triangle truss connection and shortening the vertical distances of the triangle truss. The compression capacity of the wall is mainly determined by the compression capacity of concrete, and the bonding strength between the wall and the insulating plate is the main influencing factor of the shearing capacity of the wall. According to the tensile strength and corrosion resistance tests of Austenitic stainless steel, the bearing capacity of the triangle truss does not decrease after corrosion, indicating good corrosion resistance.",

Microcracking behavior at critical stress (rcr) region, using seven fiber addition volume of 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, and 2.0% was evaluated, at two aspect ratios (60 and 75). The specimens were loaded up to a specified compressive stress levels (0.70fc–0.96fc), and subsequently subjected to split tensile tests. This was followed by microscopic analyses afterwards. Four compressive stress levels as percentage of fc were selected according to the linearity end point based on stress–time (r-t) diagram under uniaxial compression. It was seen that pre-compression has an effect on the linearity end point as well as fiber addition where it lies within 85-91% of fc. Tensile strength gain was observed in some cases with respect to the 'maiden' tensile strength as oppose to tensile strength loss due to the fiber addition with teething effect. Aggregate cracking was the dominant failure mode instead of bond cracks due to improved matrix quality. The presence of the steel fiber improved the extensive failure pattern of cracks where it changes from 'macrocracks' to a branched network of microcracks especially at higher fiber dosages. The applied pre-compression resulted in hardening effect, but the cracking process is similar to that in concrete without fiber addition.",

Therefore, in order to increase the early-age strength of high replacement (30-70%) low-calcium ultrafine FA blended cement paste, sodium sulfate and calcium sulfate dihydrate were used to improve the reactivity of FA. The results show that sodium sulfate has a significant enhancement effect on the strength of the composite pastes in the early and late ages, while calcium sulfate dihydrate has only a slight effect in the late ages. The addition of sodium sulfate in the cement-FA blended system can enhance the gain rate of non-evaporation water, and can decrease the Ca(OH)2 content. In addition, when the sulfate chemical activators are added, the ettringite content increases, and the surface of the FA is dissolved and hydrated.",

The trial mixes comprise the 25, 50, 75, and 100% replacement of natural coarse aggregate. The compressive strength of the resulting lightweight concrete with full replacement of coarse aggregate by plastic aggregate was 28 MPa. These slabs are considered to have a reduced dead weight due to using lightweight aggregate and due to reducing cross-section through using voids. The samples are tested under two verticals line loads. Several parameters are varied in this study such as; nature of coarse aggregate (natural or recycled), slab line load location, the shape of the core, core diameter, flexural reinforcement ratio, and thickness of the slab. Strain gauges are used in the present study to measure the strain of steel in each slab. The test samples were fourteen one-way reinforced concrete slabs. The slab's dimensions are (1000 mm), (600 mm), (200 mm), (length, width, and thickness). The change in the shape of the core from circular to square and the use of (100 mm) side length led to reducing the weight by about (46%). The cracking and ultimate strength is reduced by about (5%-6%) respectively. With similar values of deflection. The mode of failure will remain flexural. It is recognized that when the thickness of the slab changed from (200 mm to 175 mm) the result shows a reduction in cracking and ultimate strength by about (6% and 7%) respectively.",

It was demonstrated that the type and amount of impurities in mineralogical composition of zeolitic tuffs are significantly effective on their early pozzolanic reactivity. Zeolite mineral content, however, is more determinative on long term reactivity.

It is also considered that the beam is in thermal environment leading to the thermal buckling at elevated temperatures. The first buckling mode shape of the beam has been considered as the\r\ngeometrically imperfect configuration. The calculated post-buckling loads of a GOP-reinforced beam are shown to be dependent on several factors including graphene oxide volume, graphene oxide distribution, geometry imperfectness and also center deflection.",

    "abstract": "Self-compacting concrete used in reinforced concrete structures with high reinforcement ratios such as ports, tall buildings and bridges can bring benefits to the structures. However, the quality of self-compacting concrete is affected by climate conditions and curing methods. Climate conditions are dry and rainy seasons. Curing methods include external and internal curing. External curing by covering the surface of specimens with nylon sheet for zero hour, 4h, 6h and 24h was investigated in this study. Different amounts of lightweight sand to be able to hold water for internal curing were also examined. Results showed that with the combination of internal curing by using 20% lightweight sand to replace traditional sand and external curing by covering with nylon sheet for 24 hours, the compressive strength of self-compacting concrete in the dry season condition is higher than that of self-compacting concrete without lightweight sand ideally cured by soaking under water at laboratory condition.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the earthquake component effects on the seismic performance of Bhakra Gravity Dam in India are investigated. For the purpose, Bhakra Dam is modeled two-dimensionally considering dam-reservoir-foundation interaction. In the finite element modeling, dam and foundation are represented by PLANE182 elements in ANSYS with different material properties, and fluid is considered with FLUID29 elements. This type of element provides translation and pressure degrees of freedom. Linear time history analyses on the dam are performed by considering components of the 1991 Uttarkashi and 1999 Chamoli (NW Himalaya) Earthquakes in India. During the analyses firstly the horizontal component of earthquakes are applied to system and results are obtained, and then both of horizontal and vertical components are applied to the systems together. In the analyses, element matrices are computed using the Gauss numerical integration technique. The Newmark method is used in the solution of the equation of motions. Also, Rayleigh damping is considered. The seismic performance of Bhakra Dam is examined and presented by dynamic characteristics, displacements, principal stresses, and demand-capacity ratios. The results showed that the vertical components of the earthquake significantly affect the response of the dam. The results show that the vertical component with the horizontal component cause biggest tensile stresses compared to only the horizontal component for both earthquakes. However, displacement response is changed depending on the ground motion. As a conclusion of this study it can be said that the vertical component changes the structural response of the dam on both of the good and bad behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Several factors need to be considered in modeling of reinforced concrete beams. Bond-slip is one of the most important factors that play a key role in the behavior of reinforced concrete structures, under static and dynamic loads. A comparison between the results of experimental tests and numerical models show that considering a complete bond (perfect with no slip) instead of real bond-slip phenomenon, in numerical finite element models leads to higher estimations for the stiffness. In this study, the effects of the bond-slip phenomenon on the behavior of the reinforced concrete beams are considered. It is shown that the influence of bond-slip behavior between steel and concrete depends on the compressive strength of concrete, the concrete cover, stirrups and rebar diameter. Subsequently, a method is proposed to consider the effects of the interfacial behavior between concrete and rebar while a complete bond assumption remains and the rebar is introduced as embedded element in concrete. The bond-slip effect is considered by adding an equivalent strain of bond to the strain of steel rebar and then modifying the terms of the modulus of elasticity of steel. Validation model and parametric analyses are conducted to consider the effects of bond-slip properties and other parameters affecting the behavior of reinforced concrete beams.",

    "abstract": "Roller compacted concrete (RCC) used in the island reef airport runway will be subjected to the coupling actions of the fatigue impacts and the salt spray cycles, which will accelerate the deterioration of runway concrete and even threaten the flight safety. A cyclic impact testing machine and a climatic chamber were used to simulate the low-velocity fatigue impact and the salt spray cycles, respectively. The physical properties, the microstructures and the porosity of RCC were investigated. The results show the flexural strength firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of the fatigue impacts and the salt spray cycles. However, the decrease in the flexural strength is significantly earlier than the compressive strength of RCC only subjected to the salt spray cycles. The chlorine, sulfur and magnesium elements significantly increase in the pores of RCC subjected to 30000 fatigue impacts and 300 salt spray cycles, which causes the decrease in the porosity of RCC. The coupling effects of the fatigue impacts and the salt spray cycles in the later period accelerates the deterioration of RCC.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, nano-reinforcing materials are widely utilized in cement composites due to their unique multifunctional properties. This study incorporated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the cementitious composites at ratios of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5%, and investigated their influence on the flowability, mechanical strength, and hydration heat properties. The addition of MWCNTs enhanced the compressive and split tensile strengths approximately by 18-51%. In the semi-adiabatic temperature rise test, the internal hydration heat of the composites reduced by 5%, 9%, and 12% with the increase of MWCNTs in 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5%. This study further performed hydration heat analysis and estimated the adiabatic temperature rise, thermal stress, and thermal crack index. The internal hydration heat of the concrete decreased by 5%, 10%, and 13% with the increase of MWCNTs. The thermal stress of the concrete decreased with increase in the addition of MWCNTs, and the obtained temperature crack index was effective in controlling the thermal cracks.",
