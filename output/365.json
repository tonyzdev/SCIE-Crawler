    "abstract": "Phytotechnologies are ecotechnologies relating to the use of vegetation, to resolve environmental problems in a watershed management, by prevention of landscape degradation, remediation and restoration of degraded ecosystems, kontrol of environmental processes, and monitoring and assessment of environmental quality. They are beginning to offer efficient tools and environmentally friendly solutions for the cleanup of contaminated sites and water, the improvement of food chain safety, and the development of renewable bioenergy, contributing to a sustainable use of water and land. In the framework of COST Action 859, a European-wide integration and expansion of research and development efforts have been established to use phytotechnologies as instruments for management and removal of environmental pollutants, as well as for improving food quality and safety. This network aims to contribute to the implementation, assessment and integration of appropriate and efficient phytotreatments for sustainable land use management, ecosystem restoration and mitigation strategies applicable to different environmental compartments. However, each of these goals requires a sound understanding of how plants can specifically accumulate or exclude essential elements, toxic metals, and organic pollutants. This includes knowledge on the bioavailability of metals and xenobiotics in the rhizosphere, their uptake by roots, translocation to and detoxification/storage in the above-ground parts of the plant, at physiological, biochemical and molecular levels. The purpose of the present position paper, based on recent publications by members of COST Action 859, is to sum up major outlines, outcomes and outlook from the network and to highlight some critical points where significant progress has been made in Europe over the last few years to overcome bottlenecks in the plant removal and detoxification of pollutants. Four topics are developed here, pointing out the specific items addressed by the different Working Groups: environmental pollution and potential of phytoremediation; improving nutritional quality and safety of food crops; plant uptake/exclusion and translocation of nutrients and contaminants; exploiting “omics” approaches in phytotechnologies.",

Two sunflower cultivars (ORI-42B and ORI-48B) were grown under control and saline (150 mM NaCl) conditions. Ten levels (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100 mg L -1 ) of ALA were applied as a foliar spray to 30-day old sunflower plants. Salt stress considerably reduced growth, leaf chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents, water-use efficiency (WUE = A/E), photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (g,) and transpiration (E), while it did not affect chlorophyll a/b ratio, sub-stomatal CO 2 concentration (C 1 ) and C/C a ratio. Although foliar-applied varying levels of ALA significantly improved the root fresh and dry weights, chlorophyll a and b, chlorophyll a/b ratio, carotenoids, A, E, g s and WUE of salt-stressed sunflower plants, they had no significant effect on shoot fresh and dry weights, C 1 and C/C a ratio. Of 10 varying levels of ALA, 40 and 50, 80 and 100 mg L -1 were most effective in enhancing these parameters under saline conditions. Of the two sunflower cultivars, cv. ORI-48B was relatively higher in growth, chlorophyll a and b contents and A, while cv. ORI-42B in chlorophyll a/b ratio and carotenoids. Overall, ALA-induced growth improvement in salt-stressed sunflower plants was found to be associated with increase in chlorophyll pigments and photosynthetic rate.",

    "abstract": "Since more than a century, soils, waters, sediments and the subsurface are facing a massive pollution by a large series of chemicals and by chemo-physical stresses. Microorganisms are the major players in counteracting such stresses and recycling elements by mineralizing or partitioning pollutants, even in environments poor in nutrients or lacking availability of major electron donors and acceptors. In chemical-polluted soils or where salinity and other physical stresses exist, a complex biota that includes microorganisms and plants has to face major challenges for survival and growth. The present review intends to show that an important role for the detoxification processes in the soil environment is played by microorganisms and/or by the interactions between microorganisms and plants where the microbial symbionts promote the plant growth and, in synergy with the host, facilitate plant survival. Here we present some examples of cooperation between different microbial species and between microorganisms and plants highlighting the importance of these interactions. As a first example, the effectiveness of microbial reductive dehalogenation of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) is shown as an emerging important process for remediating groundwater and sediments from recalcitrant halogenated aliphatic and aromatic molecules. As far as with plant microbe interactions, it is shown from the literature that microorganisms can remarkably facilitate plant survival and growth under stressing conditions like those affecting arid and saline soils. It is proposed that in the future the plant ecosystem should be considered in its whole biota complexity in which, besides plants, the plant-associated microorganisms play a key role for crop sustainability and soil remediation. Finally, it is discussed that the understanding of the interactions and the ecological relationships between microorganisms and between microorganisms and plants from both mechanistic and theoretical perspectives is mandatory for addressing the global environmental problems our planet are facing.",

    "abstract": "The nitrogen (N) mineralization characteristics of organic manures, green manures and crop residues in relation to their quality were investigated in a Vertisol. The proportion of N mineralized from different organic materials ranged from -28% in wheat straw to 95% in gliricidia. The N release from good quality materials (green manures & poultry manure) having C:N ratio of 12 to 14:1 was fast. Whereas the organic materials (farmyard manure, soybean and chickpea straw) with intermediate quality having C:N ratio of 29 to 33:1 resulted in immobilization of N during the first 6 weeks of incubation and subsequent release of mineral N from 8 to 16 weeks of incubation. Addition of urea with these materials to raise the N content of the materials to 2%, and narrow the C:N ratio to 18 to 22:1, resulted in net mineralization of N from the first week onwards. Addition of poor quality wheat straw with a C:N ratio of 79:1 resulted in a marked decrease in mineral N, due to immobilization of N, throughout the incubation period. Addition of urea N to bring down the C:N ratio to 22 helped in faster mineralization of N from the wheat straw + urea mixture. Correlations between quality parameters of the organic materials and the proportion of N mineralized at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after incubation showed that N mineralization was strongly influenced by N content and C:N ratio of the organic materials. In contrast, lignin and polyphenol contents had no effect on mineralization, but ratios of lignin/polyphenol, polyphenol/N, and lignin+polyphenol/N had significant negative relationships with N mineralization.",

    "abstract": "Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is the major grain crop in the Pampas. Its productivity strongly depends on soil nitrogen availability and biological nitrogen fixation because nitrogen fertilizers are not usually applied. Scarce local information has been generated about biological nitrogen fixation potential of soybean crops or to the soil nitrogen balance during its growing season. A meta-analysis was performed of locally published results from 10 field experiments in order to estimate average values of nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere, crop yield and soil nitrogen balance in the region and, also, to fit a regression model relating yield and fixed nitrogen. Results were compared with a nitrogen balance calculated using a model fitted to worldwide data. Nitrogen fixation in aboveground biomass was assessed by isotopic methodologies in all the experiments and an estimation of fixed nitrogen in roots was performed. Grain yield varied from 662 kg of dry matter (DM) ha -1 for non nodulating isolines to 4260 kg DM ha -1 for commercial varieties. Nitrogen fixation accounted for 20 to 55% of the plant nitrogen. In average, 40% of the soybean nitrogen was fixed from the atmosphere, rounding 109 kg N ha -1 . Shoot biomass and grain yield were positively correlated to fixed nitrogen (R 2 0.69, P = 0.05). The slope of the regression of the amount of fixed nitrogen against yield showed that, in average, the crop fixed from the atmosphere 52 kg of N t -1 DM grain produced. By harvest approximately 60 kg of N t -1 DM were extracted from the agricultural system. Consequently, the apparent soil nitrogen balance was slightly negative and as higher the yield, the more negative the nitrogen balance. For an average soybean yield in the Pampas (2600 kg ha -1 , 14% water) the soil nitrogen balance can be estimated to be -18 kg N ha -1 yr -1 . Estimation of fixed nitrogen with the model adjusted to worldwide data was higher than with the local model and the calculated nitrogen balance turned to positive, so this later model seemed not to be applicable to pampean conditions. Future research is needed for the evaluation and the development of management practices and crop rotations for minimizing the negative soil nitrogen balance of the region.",

The aim of the study was to assess the concentration of heavy metals and microelements in different environmental matrixes, namely: soil, leaf tissues of coniferous and deciduous trees, mosses (spp. Hypnum cupressiforme) and grass, and washed-leaves water. The concentration of heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cu. Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn) was detected using an ICP-OE Spectrometer. For sampling point of Massari park in Ferrara city (FE-M1) and of Giardini Margherita park in Bologna city (BO-M3) heavy metals concentrations exceeded the threshold values established by the current Italian laws for soils of public, residential and private areas (D.Lgs 152/2006). The correlation between the concentration values of top- and subsoil highlights that some elements, such as Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, have an anthropic origin and are mainly linked to the deposition of airborne pollutants, while other elements (Co, Cr and Ni) have a lithologic origin. The study of mosses, grass and the washed-leaves water made it possible to identify seasonal variations of pollutants deposition and, furthermore, to calculate the enrichment coefficient and the accumulation of heavy metals over time.",

Fe3O4 NPs, 6 nm diameter, were dispensed at doses ranging from 2.01 to 33.5 mg/l to carrot in vitro cultures at different times, along the stages of cell growth and embryogenic differentiation. Moreover, the mitotic index of cell cultures under treatments has been cytologically determined. The results demonstrated that Fe3O4 NPs exposure from 2.01 to 6.70 mg/l slightly affected growth, mitotic index, and de-differentiation. At the dose of 20.10 mg/l cell growth and relative mitotic index dropped dramatically, and stopped completely at 33.5 mg/l. Moreover, these higher doses, entirely blocked embryo formation when treatments were done along somatic embryogenesis induction. Therefore, this model system seems well suited to check NPs impact on developmental processes.",

The performance of the QTK was also checked for linearity, accuracy, precision and potential interferences. The work demonstrated that the test for NO 3 - can be successfully applied to all the types of samples under investigation, while for Pi determination high sulphate concentrations in the sample should be avoided. By contrast, the test for NH 4 + resulted inappropriate, presumably because of the interference by NO 3 - .",

At optimum conditions, the maximum removal of lead was observed to be 85% by dried biomass and 80% by cellulose for a 10 mg L ' solution of lead (II) ions. The sorption process obeyed a heterogeneous adsorptin model (Freundlich Isotherm) rather than a monolayer one (Langmuir Isotherm).

Calcite addition induced variations in the pore volumes, which were purely addictive and depended on the porosity characteristics of the silicate plus organic fraction and CaCO 3 . In the Calcisol samples, the removal of carbonates increased the pore volumes, but the mechanism cannot be explained by a simple additive effect. The < 2 nm pores were affected by the non-carbonate soil fraction, the 2-50 nm size class was the most affected by calcification, while the infilling of the larger pores depended on the size and on carbonate contents. The largest pores are infilled only when CaCO3 concentration is around 30%, while the smallest class determined with Hg intrusion is affected at about 15% of carbonates.",

    "abstract": "S!#$%. – Weather conditions which characterize heat waves (e.g. high temperatures, severe drought, increased solar radiation, stagnation of air masses, increased presence of biogenic volatile compounds) are highly conductive to the formation and persistence of photochemically-produced tropospheric ozone. However, it is the actual dose of ozone uptake through stomata rather than mere exposure that determines the ozone impact to vegetation. There are evidences that drought protects plants from ozone injury by stomatal closure, which restricts ozone influx into the leaves. Conversely, in natural ecosystems and in non-irrigated crops dry deposition of ozone, which is mainly due to stomatal absorption, is curtailed. As a consequence, during heat wave episodes more ozone is produced and less ozone is depleted by dry deposition: the positive contribute of vegetation to improve air quality fails when we need it most! So, ozone is a major risk factor for living organisms (especially human beings) during extreme summer weather conditions. In addition, ozone is a powerful greenhouse gas and its increase contributes to further air warming. The paper reports some ozone data captured in Tuscany during the summer of 2012 and the results of biomonitoring campaigns performed during the same period. More frequent (and intense) exceedances of dangerous ground level ozone thresholds would be expected in Southern Europe at the current emission levels if summer weather conditions such as those of 2003 and 2012 will become a rule in the coming decades.

Its concentrations in the troposphere increased dramatically during the last century and show worldwide relevant peak values in urban, suburban and remote areas (K<=% et al. , 1999). Today more than 95% of the total European Union urban population is exposed to ozone levels above World Health Organizations guidelines. Ozone is formed in the troposphere by the interaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and the UV radiation from the sun. NO 2 absorbs UV radiation to decompose the molecule into nitrogen monoxide (NO) and an activated oxygen atom (O ∙- ). On contact with molecular oxygen (O 2), ozone (O 3) is formed.

    "abstract": "NaCl-stress caused a great reduction in sucrose accumulation and yield, and biomass production by roots of sugarbeet plants grown for 6 months in greenhouse. Irrigating plants with saline water (100 and 200 mM) reduced the leaf concentration of total carbohydrates and proteins, particularly at 200 mM NaCl. In contrast, soluble sugars and proteins, and total free amino acids (TAA), including proline, were progressively accumulated as NaCl level increased. 100 mM NaCl induced a marked increase in the activity of sucrose-degrading enzymes [alkaline and acid invertases (IV s ), and sucrose synthase (SS)] and hexose concentration in the storage roots, but a reverse trend was noticed at 200 mM NaCl. However, sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) activity and sucrose accumulation were progressively suppressed as salinity level increased. Applying ascorbic acid, especially with 4 mM, to sugarbeet has alleviated the adverse effects by increasing the salt-tolerance of the plant. This counteraction was associated with no change in SS activity, but with a distinct increase in all other test characters, except leaf proline and root hexose accumulation, and IV activities that were evidently retarded. This response may indicate a specific role of ascorbic acid in sucrose and protein metabolism. It may also explain the role of soluble sugars, proteins, TAA and proline in osmotic adjustment. Results showed also a negative correlation between sucrose accumulation in roots, and IV and SS activities that, in turn, were positively correlated with hexose concentration. Conversely, SPS activity was directly correlated with sucrose accumulation confirming a decisive role of this enzyme with IV s in the regulation of sugar storage by sugarbeet roots. Possible regulation and energetic differences between all sucrose-metabolizing enzymes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A 34-year long-term fertilizer experimental (LTFE) site on a Typic Haplustept at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (New Delhi) was used for the present study. The objective was to investigate the effect of six fertilizer and farmyard manure (FYM) treatments (Control, N, NP, NPK, NPK + S, NPK + FYM) and three physiological stages (tillering, flowering and dough) of wheat crop on the pattern of mineral N (NH 4 + and NO 3 - ), mineralizable N and Olsen-P dynamics in soil, and concentration of N and P in wheat crop during November 2004 to April 2005. A balanced application of NPK (i.e. 100% NPK) + farmyard manure (FYM) showed highest values of the above observations and control (0 NPK) showed the lowest. Growth stages of wheat crop affected the studied parameters significantly (p < 0.05), being highest at tillering followed by flowering and dough stages. A significant positive interactive effect of fertiliser treatments and stages of wheat growth was also recorded for N and P availability in soil and their uptake by wheat crop. Stepwise regressions have revealed that grain yield of wheat was significantly associated with mineralizable N at tillering (R 2 = 0,80), NO 3 -N at flowering (R 2 = 0.73), and Olsen-P and Plant-P (R 2 = 0.87) at dough stage of wheat growth. The results indicate that in the background of long-term fertility management regimes, crop growth (rhizospheric feed back) stages have signigicant impact on the nutrient dynamics in soil and nutrient concentration in growing plants.",

In both conventional and organic farming, we assessed copper accumulation in soil, grapes and leaves, microbiological activity, soil physical-chemical characteristics, and wine quality. The results gave higher copper concentrations in soil and plants of organic vineyards. For both farming regimes the highest copper concentrations were found in leaves whilst fruits gave lower concentrations. As for copper residues in wine, they always were in compliance with the current law limit (1 mg L -1 ). The microbiological activity was lower in soil subjected to traffic in both management. In conventional soil, the lesser demand of machinery passages induced a lesser penetration resistance and a higher shear strength. Finally, no differences were found as grapes yield, although the biological wine gave a better organoleptic quality.",

    "abstract": "A pot experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that decomposition of organic matter in sewage sludge and the consequent formation of dissolved organic compounds (DOC) would lead to an increase in the bioavailability of the heavy metals. Two Brown Earth soils, one with clayey loam texture (CL) and the other a loamy sand (LS) were mixed with sewage sludge at rates equivalent to 0, 10 and 50 t dry sludge ha - 1 and the pots were sown with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The organic matter content and heavy metal availability assessed with soil extractions with 0.05 M CaCl 2 were monitored over a residual time of two years, while plant uptake over one year, after addition of the sludge. It was found that the concentrations of Cd and Ni in both the ryegrass and the soil extracts increased slightly but significantly during the first year. In most cases, this increase was most evident especially at the higher sludge application rate (50 t ha - 1 ). However, in the second year metal availability reached a plateau. Zinc concentrations in the ryegrass did not show an increase but the CaCl 2 extracts increased during the first year. In contrast, organic matter content decreased rapidly in the first months of the first year and much more slowly in the second (total decrease of 16%). The concentrations of DOC increased significantly in the more organic rich CL soil in the course of two years. The pattern followed by the decomposition of organic matter with time and the production of DOC may provide at least a partial explanation for trend towards increased metal availability.",

The nitrogen applied to maize significantly influenced grain protein and N uptake in maize; yield, grain protein and N uptake in winter barley, whereas no significant difference between N fertilised plots in both species were found. Postanthesis N uptake were significantly higher in N treatments for maize and winter barley, whereas no significant difference between N fertilised plots and control for N retranslocation were observed. Soil mineral N deficit at the end of cropping system was higher in the intermediate N fertilization level then in the highest one, indicating that only the 100 kg N ha - 1 treatment utilised all applied and mineralised N. Therefore, the intermediate N level seems to ensure a good balance among yield, quality and N utilisation of maize and barley, with smaller risks of nitrogen leaching.",

It was shown that reddening of cotton leaves was related to an increased formation of anthocyanin pigments, mainly cyanidin glycosides, while cinnamic acid derivatives and flavonoids were not significantly changed. The plausible protective role of anthocyanins is discussed, particularly taking into account the shift from malvidin to cyanidin aglycones, i.e. to o-dihydroxy substitution in the B-ring of the anthocyanins during cotton leaf reddening that may determine a higher antioxidant and antiradical capacity.",

The copper concentrations were found to exceed the zinc concentrations in all soils and particle size fractions studied. Worth special note was the sand fraction, which contained much higher Cu and Zn concentrations than the fractions of smaller particle size. Also, the Cu content in the sand fraction was significantly correlated with the amount of soluble Cu in water (r = 0.69, p < 0.01). Organically bound Cu and residual Zn constituted the most important fractions in the three aggregate sizes studied.",

We examined a hilly basin in Gallura (Sardinia) where it is possible to observe an ecological progression from an intensive agricultural practice (vineyard with traditional tillage) to a conservative condition (cork oak forest) through intermediate steps (grassy vineyard, temporary grassland, pasture). A molecular analysis of the total eubacterial population was carried out by electrophoretic separation performed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of amplified cDNA fragments obtained from 16S rRNA. UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Mathematical Average) analysis revealed the presence of separate clusters of eubacteria depending on soil management. Our results indicate that soil management influences the activity of microbial communities. Intensive agricultural practices reduce the biodiversity of active microbial species while low environmental impact managements, such as pasture and forest, increase biodiversity. In autumn, the differences among managements are less marked then in spring even though clustering is still present.",

    "abstract": "- The main sources of boron (B) in the diet are drinking water (which varies considerably among geographical locations), milk and dairy products, juices and beverages. Animal products (meats, poultry, fish, etc.) contain very little boron but milk and dairy products are major contributors to total boron intake because of the large quantities consumed. Boron contents were determined in samples of the bovine milk chain (soil, crops, beverage and irrigation water) and milk from lactating dairy cows collected in 2003 and 2004 in Italian dairy farms at national (60 farms) and regional (10 farms, in Latium region) level. At national level the average total boron content in beverage water was 111.7 μg L - 1 , in the allowable limit of European and Italian Law (1000 μg L -1 ); only a value overtakes the fixed parameter (1003 μg L -1 ). In milk the total boron ranged from 108 to 574 μg L -1 , in unifeed from 5.06 to 65.9 mg kg ', in silage from 2.64 to 38.8 mg kg -1 ; the higher values in unifeed could be explained by frequently added alimentary integrator, containing minerals and trace elements that are necessary to animals. At regional level the average total boron contents in beverage (111.34 μg L') and irrigation water (109.6 ug L -1 ) were lower than to the legal limits in force for drinking water, in milk ranged from 95 to 468 μg L ', while in unifeed and silage the values were similar to the national level; the total boron levels in soils were normal, ranged from 16.85 to 87.06 mg kg '. The cow's biotransfer factors (BTFs, day L ') for boron in milk at national level were up to 14.31 x 10 -4 and 24.49 x 10 -4 (Cuneo province, for unifeed and silage, respectively), related to large quantity of beverage water by lactating cows; at regional level were lower, up to 8.73 x 10 -4 for unifeed and 7.92 x 10 -4 for silage. However, as the boron doesn't magnify through the food chains and its relatively rapid excretion in the urine, in bovine milk chain in Italian farms the boron levels do not constitute a problem.",

In addition, a soil incubation experiment was performed with samples collected immediately after the application of the fire retardant and microbial indices were determined at different time intervals (3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks). Results of laboratory assay were congruent with field data indicating that the addition of the fire retardant to soil did not change significantly the microbial parameters analysed. Based on these results, it appears that this synthetic polymer can be used in fire control since it does not appear to have a negative influence on soil microbial population.",

In this study, the precision of the Tiulin method for soil wet aggregate stability index (WASI) was evaluated through an inter-laboratory test, according to the validation procedure proposed by ISO 5725. Precision was expressed in terms of repeatability (s r ) and reproducibility (S R ) standard deviations with related limits (r and R). Six different soils, collected from three Italian agricultural areas, with different organic matter and clay contents, were chosen and six measurement replicates were carried out for each combination of soil and laboratory. The values of S r and S R , obtained after the detection of outliers according to the Grubbs (outliers in the means) and Cochran tests (outliers in the variances), ranged from 0.92 to 2.93 and from 1.42 to 12.31, respectively. The corresponding r and R ranged from 2.57 to 8.22 and from 3.98 to 34.48. No significant correlations were found either between WASI and r or between WASI and R. On the contrary the relative standard deviation of repeatability was inversely correlated (R 2 = 0.88, **p < 0.01) with soil organic matter. The precision is within the range of other chemical and biological methods and can be considered satisfactory. The results obtained in this study have demonstrated the suitability of the Tiulin method as a standard method for monitoring soil physical quality.",

Efforts were made to study the effects of recommended levels of N and P with or with out K fertilizers on K balance, contribution and release kinetics of non-exchangeable K in a sandy loam (Typic Natrustalf) gypsum amended alluvial alkali soil under a long-term fertilizer experiment on rice (Oryza sativa L.) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) initiated in 1974. Soil profile samples were collected in 2003 after the harvest of rice from treatments: control (no fertilizer), nitrogen (N), nitrogen + phosphorus (NP), nitrogen + phosphorus + potassium (NPK). Use of NPK resulted in higher contents of water soluble, exchangeable, non-exchangeable and total K in soil compared to N and NP treatments but the contents were at par with control. Crop K uptake exceeded added K indicating depletion of native K in the order: NP > N > NPK > control. Addition of optimum level of N or NP fertilizers in rice-wheat cropping system for 30 years resulted in to 13 and 41% higher mining of soil K compared to NPK fertilization. Depletion of exchangeable K ranged from 85 to 157 mg kg -1 , due to initial native high status the contents were not reduced to a level where deletion of K fertilizer could influence crop yields. To meet the crop K requirement, non-exchangeable sources contributed on an average about 95% in absence of applied K and 65% with added K. The kinetics of non-exchangeable K in 0.01 M CaC12 medium were best described by first order equation as evidenced by the highest coefficient of correlation (r = -0.985 to -0.988) and the lowest value of standard error of estimate (SE = 0.153 to 0.172). Continuous cropping for 30 years with N and NP fertilizers resulted in reduction of cumulative K release compared to no fertilization. Addition of K assisted in maintenance of release of non-exchangeable K. Continuous intensive rice - wheat cropping with N and P fertilizers alone would deplete soil K more and more and may require K addition to sustain soil K fertility.",

The proposed method foresees, on 10 g of soil, a saturation step with use of IN NH 4 OAc, followed by washing with deionized water, contact with a solution of 0.4N NaCl and re-extraction of Na + with the IN NH 4 OAc solution. The exchangeable bases were determined in the supernatant after the I st saturation step and CEC by measuring the concentration of Na + removed by NH 4 + and collected in the 2 nd step. For both measurements optical emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES) was used. For the trials two soil profiles of Vertisols were chosen, collected in the experimental farm 124 in Foggia (Italy), both with seven diagnostic horizons, with the amount of carbonates expressed as CaCO 3 %, ranging from 10% (topsoil) to 30% (subsoil). The proposed method is well correlated with the official method for single and the sum of exchangeable bases; but not for CEC.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the research was to verify the influence of the depth and quality of ground water on soil salinity within the different micro-topographical contexts of the San Vitale Pinewood, in the Ravenna Province (Italy). To this purpose four Entisols, representative of the different local geomorphological positions, were studied. Meteorological data was recorded and soils and ground water were monitored for one year, as to salinity-related aspects and electrical conductivity (EC). The water table depth and salinity have undergone remarkable oscillations with respect to seasonal weather conditions. The electrical conductivity of the ground water (ECw) differently affected the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECe), depending on the distance of the horizons from the water table. In the spring and autumn, when most of the precipitation occurred, both the water table depth and ECw decreased and this provoked an homogeneity in soils horizon ECe values. In summer, due to high temperature and minimum precipitation, a general lowering of the water table was detected to which an jncrease of surface horizons ECe corresponded. The intensity of such surface soluble salt accumulation depends on the water table depth and is independent from ground water ECw. Both soils located in inter-dune depressions, with a surface water table, but characterized by a different ground water ECw value, presented in summer a significant increase of surface horizons ECe, even if at different values (PZ1 and PZ3). The summer ECe increase in top horizons didn't occur when the water table lay at more than 1 m beneath the surface, even if strongly saline (PZ4). When the water table was present at an intermediate depth, a slight ECe increase was observed in surface horizons (PZ7). In the PZ4 profile, using a statistical analysis, a relationship was established between the soil ECe and some environmental parameters.",

A comparison of aqua regia and H 2 SO 4 + HNO 3 mixture as soil digestion procedures, in moist and dry soil samples, was performed. Both methods were valid in Cu determination, giving comparable results for this soil. Differently, a 21 % lower Cu concentration was found in moist samples with both methods. Two sequential procedures were used to chemically fractionate total Cu. The first one separated exchangeable, sorbed, organically bound, and precipitated forms. The second one separated water soluble, exchangeable, Fe and Mn and organic matter bound fractions. Despite the intrinsic differences of the sequential extractions, Cu concentrated mostly in the Fe and Mn and organically bound forms. Cu distribution in particle-size fractions revealed a high concentration of this heavy metal in silt and clay. From the results obtained we confirm the essential role of soil organic matter (SOM) in decreasing Cu toxicity, in particular through the adsorption of the metal on humified SOM and clay-SOM complexes. Pain symptoms shown by herbaceous crops could be attributable to the presence of available Cu forms, still phytotoxic after more than 20 years from land use change.",

Such phenom-ena are frequently triggered by flash flood events, i.e. extremely intense rainfall, and enhanced by discontinuities in structure and strength along the soil profile. The objective of this work was to assess soil consistency in the study area, then estimate soil liquid limit (LL) and plastic limit (PL) from routine analyses, for Alpine soils vulnerable to severe instability phenomena (solifluxion, liquefaction, debris flow, surface erosion). We considered relevant chemical and physical properties and obtained equations for liquid and plastic limit estimation, for surface and subsurface samples, with satisfactory goodness of fit. The equations, involving variables related with texture and aggregation, could help individuate potential areas showing strong profile discontinuities, and to rank them according to a preliminary vulnerability scale.",

The time evolutions of the concentrations of the various phenolic compounds in the must/wine are described as function of only two functional parameters (the kinetic constant and the maximum extractable amount) by introducing kinetic equations. A significant difference of anthocyanins concentration in the cryomacerated wine compared to the traditional one was observed due to the fact that a more efficient extraction occurred and because CO 2 protected wines against oxidation.",

    "abstract": "Olive cakes are a by-product of the olive oil industry. Their possible valorization in animal feeds requires the knowledge of their chemical composition. Whatever the mode of extraction of the olive oil, whether traditional, or with three phases or with two phases, the olive cakes present a variable chemical composition which is different from that of other oleaginous sources. The analysis of olive cake samples from different types of mills and collected in different areas of Lebanon shows that they present relatively high amounts of crude fiber (44-58%) and fat content (7-17%) and low amount of proteins (3-5%) and ash (2%). The polyphenols do not exceed 0.5% of the dry matter. More advanced analysis on the parietal fraction, by the method of Van Soest, made it possible to deduce the amounts of cellulose (32-37%), hemicelluloses (20-23%) and lignin (19-24%). The parameter most significantly varying as a function of the mill type is fat content. This result is confirmed by a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) based on the compositional variables. The olive cakes resulting from traditional mills are richer in fat contents than those resulting from mills with two or three phases. Lastly, the composition of the parietal components presents a slight, not very significant, variation for the different samples analyzed. This can lead to the conclusion that it is the same variety of olive which is treated with different extraction processes.",

The values of the activation energy (E a ) and temperature coefficient (Q 10 ) for each enzyme did not differ much among soils. Less difference was observed in Ea and Q 10 values than in kinetic parameters within the studied range of temperature suggesting that, the fluctuation of temperature affected more kinetic rather than thermodynamic behaviors of soil hydrolases.",

In comparison with the control, leaves showed higher amounts of B and TBARS and lower contents of glutathione as well as decreased GR and APX activities. Moreover, with time control leaves showed decreases in TBARS and reduced glutathione (GSH) contents and increases in oxidised glutathione (GSSG) amount and GR and APX activities. In contrast, nutritional value of tomato berries did not change with the treatment since both antioxidant activity and major antioxidants amounts remained constant.",

Uptake and translocation of Cd, as well as tolerance to Cd is a complex phenomenon including various biochemical and physiological processes. Important and not very well studied is the relation between the structure of root, as an organ of Cd uptake and characteristics of plants in reaction to Cd. Impregnation of cell walls of peripheral root tissues by suberin and lignin, formation of root apoplasmic barriers, exodermis and endodermis, affect radial transport of Cd into vascular tissues. Examples of aquatic plants differing in Cd uptake and translocation and also differing in the root structure are shown. Specific peri-endodermal layer in root of hyperaccumulator Thlaspi (Noccaea) caerulescens is absent in closely related non-accumulator T. arvense. The difference in the structure of maize primary seminal root and thin lateral roots indicate different role of these two root types.",

Application of a general linear model to experimental data revealed the limes to be more effective than the sugar foams in decreasing the amount of exchangeable Al in the soil and in raising its pH. On the other hand, the sugar foams were found to more effective in increasing the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of the soil and, in general, the base content in the exchange complex. The sugar foam-based treatments proved more efficient in raising the Ca, Mg, K, Cu and Zn levels in dry matter, and also in increasing forage production.",

Our experiments were conducted on potted plants in a greenhouse, using spiked soil with cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc. The root and aerial biomasses were recorded, and then the entire plant was digested with acids to determine the nutrients and heavy metal concentrations. Most nutrients and heavy metals concentrations increased in all species. Concentration of nutrients was generally within normal ranges in all species o slightly low. Except Cu the heavy metal concentrations were in excessive or toxic ranges when plants were grown in spiked treatments. The aerial and root biomasses of P. hortorum were unaffected as the soil concentration of metals increased, while the biomasses of the other three species were significantly reduced. From the studied species only P. hortorum can be suggested for cultivation on heavy metals contaminated soils.",

Classical biochemical, ecophysiological (BIOLOG) and molecular methods (DGGE) were used. Samplings were performed just before treatments (Tl), with plants still in the field, after 6 months (T2) and 12 months (T3). A significant difference in microbial respiration and diversity among GM plots and controls was observed in Tl but after 6 and 12 months such differences disappeared, suggesting a strong correlation between plants and microorganisms, as well as a short-term impact.",

The soil was a coarse-loamy over sandy, mixed, mesic Fluventic Ustochrept (Soil Taxonomy) or a Calcaric Cambisol (FAO). The experimental design was a split-plot with four replicates; the main factor was the soil management system (conventional tillage, CT, and no-tillage, NT), while the secondary factor was the rate of applied nitrogen (N0 = 0 and N 1 = 270 kg N ha -1 ). At the end of the third year soil samples were taken at four depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20 cm). For these samples, pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter, total N, available P, exchangeable K, cation exchange capacity and carbonates were determined. Water aggregate stability was determined only for the 0-20 cm layer. Statistical analysis shows that no-till positively influenced all the indicators except for carbonates and CEC, whereas N fertilization had no significant effects. There were no significant interactions for any of the indices. As regards the 0-20 cm layer, which is the most interesting from an agronomic point of view, the most important results are as follows. The OM content in NT plots was significantly higher than in CT plots (31.6 vs 29.5 g kg -1 ), as was the total N (2.03 vs 1.92 g kg -1 ). NT had a very clear effect on the available P content, which for NT was 59% higher than CT. As for the exchangeable K, this was 33% higher in the untilled plots compared to ploughed plots, but not significantly so. The most remarkable result was found for WAS: for NT the value was almost 2.5 times that for CT (34.1 vs 14.1%).",

    "abstract": "Pyrimethanil (PYR) is widely used to control Botrytis cinerea, Ventunria inaequalis, and V. pirina. When used on crops a great quantity of this fungicide is introduced into the soil where it can accumulate if it is adsorbed in great quantities and there is little degradation. Previous works showed that PYR is strongly adsorbed on soil which consequently limits its bioavailability. Although some degradation tests on soil reported in literature produced half-life times values for this compound, no information is available regarding its degradability when a commercial product is used. Given the current lack of information regarding the persistence of PYR in the soil, this work highlights its behaviour in two soils and concentrates on how the commercial product behaved rather than the pure active ingredient. Degradation tests were also carried out in sterile water with different pH (4, 7 and 9) and in two water samples taken from the Simeto River (Sicily, Italy). The half-life times found were lower than those reported in the literature. Degradation time was lower in the soil containing the largest amount of organic matter, thus confirming the important role played by the micro-organisms it contains in the degradation of the molecule. The commercial product behaved differently both as regards adsorption and degradation. In fact, a weak adsorption was accompanied by faster degradation. PYR did not degrade in sterile water at any of the pHs tested. The same result was obtained from natural water even when the samples were added with glucose to encourage the development of micro-organisms, demonstrating the incapacity of the microflora present in water to degrade the molecule..",

Three levels of Jift and Zebar soil treatment, as well as chemical fertilizer and animal manure, were assigned randomly in a randomized complete block design, at three replications. Treatment of Jift with soil at ratio 1:12, and treatment with Zebar at a rate of 41 m 2 increased grain yield and total biomass of wheat crop. Early heading was observed in the Jift ratio 1:12 and in the Zebar rate 21 m 2 treatments, at 58 and 57 days respectively, compared to untreated control. Chemical analysis for inorganic nutrient elements in the foliage of crop revealed that both treatments, Jift and Zebar, resulted in an increased in nitrogen content, potassium, zinc, and iron concentration. But there was no significant difference in the phosphorus concentration of treated plants compared to the control. There was no significant difference in the harvest index between treated plants and untreated control. Phenological traits were sensitive to a high rate of treatment of Jift and Zebar with soil.",

We noticed that most fatty acid compounds were insensitive to regional variations which emphasize the nutraceutical use of seeds. Besides, essential oils were extracted from seeds by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC and GC/MS. Chromatographic analysis revealed the identification of forty five compounds. The major constituents were camphor (33,8%), α-pinene (48,0%), and octane (27,4%) in samples collected from Sabelet Ben Ammar, Sers and Somâa, respectively.

In experiment 1 the plants were grown in aerated or not aerated nutrient solution, while in experiment 2 three nutrient solutions containing 2.0 (control), 25 or 50 mmol/l NaCl were tested. Dissolved oxygen content averaged 7.8 mg/l and 3.2 mg/l in aerated and not-aerated nutrient solution, respectively. The plants were harvested at full bloom and RA was quantified in both root and leaf tissues. Floating raft system provides a suitable growing method of sweet basil for agroindustrial production of RA.

On the basis of analysis of some physicochemical parameters and sensory evaluations, it is possible to discern the best storage conditions: 24°C temperature, 70% RH, 100% CO 2 .

The interrelationships between 30 survey variables of nominal, ordinal and continuous nature, including agronomic and soil variables, were analysed using Optimal Scaling and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover the structure of the variables in the system and detect the relationships between them. 210 olive groves were surveyed in the study period. In this work, we used the Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA) as an Optimal Scaling procedure to quantify nominal and ordinal variables, and also, as an exploratory method for selecting the most representative variables of the system. Subsequently, the factorial model was refined by means of a classical PCA. Seven components were extracted, and these accounted for 74% of the total variance. PC1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 are related to agronomic and climatic parameters, and PC3 and 4 are related to soil parameters. PCA confirmed the expert impression of high consistency with farmer's knowledge (agronomic and pedological) reflected in surveys. The Clustering of the soils based on user knowledge gave rise to 3 large clusters or user groups. The latter are differentiated by several user soil parameters: soil depth, hardened layer depth, stoniness and mean slope. Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA) showed that farmers discriminated the most contrasted soil map units as Litosols (that farmers perceived as shallow) and Fluvisols and Luvisols (that farmers perceived as flat). This suggests that user knowledge could be used by soil scientists.",

Seed priming (a pre sowing treatment in water on osmotic solution that allows seeds proceed to the first stage of germination but prevents radical protrusion through the seed coat) has been shown to improve crop germination and establishment. Laboratory and green house experiments were conducted to determine the effects of seed priming on Canola (Opera cultivar) germination and emergence index under non stress and drought stress conditions. Results from these experiments showed that seed priming enhanced germination and emergence index. Seeds primed in water and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) led to higher emergence and germination index than control seeds (check) under both conditions whereas KCl had a negative effect and decreased these traits compared to the check. The results obtained from this study indicated that seed priming has potential for improving seed germination and stand establishment of canola under stress and non stress conditions.",

Salt stress had no negative effect on growth parameters and photosynthetic pigments. Lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage, H 2 O 2 content and lipoxygenase (LOX) activity remained unaffected, but the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) was enhanced by salt stress. On the contrary, PEG decreased growth parameters and photosynthetic pigments and increased oxidative stress and all antioxidant enzymes activity. However, ASA pre-treatment, especially at 1 μM, improved growth parameters and photosynthetic pigments, reduced lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage, H 2 O 2 content and LOX activity and enhanced the activity of SOD, GPOD, APX, CAT and GR enzymes under stresses and to a lesser extend under non-stress conditions. Pre-treatment of ASA appeared to induce preadaptive responses to salt and water stresses leading to promote protective reactions to the photosynthetic pigments and maintain the membranes integrity in this wild species of potato, which were reflected in improving the plant growth.",

    "abstract": "Spatial variability of microelements can help analyze the factors and processes controlling their availability to plants in a field. The objectives of this study were to analyze spatial structure of plant available micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and B) in a large alluvial field (45 ha) under different crop patterns, map plant available micronutrients using geostatistical methods, and evaluate the factors and processes controlling the variability of micronutrients. A geostatistical sampling scheme was adopted, and 188 soil samples were taken from topsoils (0-20 cm) and subsoils (20-40 cm). DTPA extracted Cu showed the lowest variation (CV = 25.89% for topsoil and CV = 27.48% for subsoil), and Mn showed the highest variation (CV = 47.56% for topsoils and CV = 60.62% for subsoil). Geostatistical range varied from 102 m (Mn) to 406 m (B) in top- soil. Cupper had the shortest (80 m), and B had the longest range (408 m) in subsoils. Iron content showed the strongest spatial dependency, and the rest of the micronutrients studied exhibited a moderate spatial dependency based on nugget/sill ratio. Kriging maps of micronutrients revealed that Zn was deficient in the both topsoil and subsoil of the whole field.",

Organic management resulted mainly to affect the labile C pools of soil organic matter, increasing both soluble and living fractions, and without influencing total organic C. A 4 year period of organic management was not enough to stabilize C compounds. The deep tillage generated a strong soil disturbance reducing both microbial biomass C and N, and inducing a net loss of organic matter.",

Soil samples were treated with solutions at variable Cu concentration (0 up to 50 mg L - 1 ) at a constant level of DOC, or with solutions of constant Cu content (50 mg L - 1 ) and variable DOC. Copper sorption capacity decreased for all soils in the presence of DOC, and more so in the calcareous soil (C). In the Calcaric Cambisol and the Eutric Fluvisol, less Cu was desorbed in the presence of DOC, than in the acidic soils. As the pH increased, the decrease in Cu sorption due to interaction with DOC was more marked. Conversely, without addition of DOC, Cu sorption increased with pH. Freundlich type equations described well Cu sorption (R 2 >98%). Copper was mainly specifically adsorbed and bonded to the fulvic acid fraction of DOC.",

The mean height of eggplant transplants was significantly enhanced by the 50% MSSC medium, while the tomatoes one by the medium containing 75% of MSSC. Main stem diameter of both species was greatest for those grown in peat, followed for eggplant by a medium containing 50% of MSSC and for tomato by a medium containing 75% of MSSC. Above ground fresh and dry biomass weight of eggplant transplants were the highest when grown in medium containing 50% of MSSC, while for tomato transplants the highest biomass production was for a medium containing 75% of MSSC. Concentration of heavy metals in transplants and fruits of both species was low for all percentages of MSSC used. These findings indicated that the material tested was not an environment polluting factor and was suitable for healthy vegetables production. Therefore it is assumed that MSSC can be used as an alternative low cost organic component in growing media and decrease the Greek dependency on imported materials necessary for vegetable transplants growth.",

The percentages of mineralized S were always higher in GWCtreated soil (1.3%-8.5%) than in CM-treated soil (0.9%-3.8%). In three of the six soils, particularly for CM, an immobilization of sulphur was observed. Cattle manure stimulated the arylsulphatase activity at a greater extent than green waste compost.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION. – Industrial leather processing involves a series of unit operations that can be classified into three groups: i) pretanning operations, which clean the hides or skins; ii) tanning, which permanently stabilizes the skin or hide matrix; and iii) post-tanning and finishing operations, where aesthetic value is added (THANIKAIVELAN et al., 2004). At each stage, various chemicals, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium hypochiorite, enzymes, lime, chlorides, sulphuric acid, formic acid, ammonium salts, kerosene, and other compounds are used and a variety of materials are expelled as liquid effluents and solid wastes (CABEZA et al., 1998). One ton of wet salted hides yields 200 kg of leather, along with about 250 kg of tanned solid waste and about 350 kg of nontanned waste (ALEXANDER et al., 1991). About 75% of the solid waste is produced when the tanned hide is shaved to a uniform thickness. These shavings are small particles, in a variety of shapes, mainly consisting of collagen cross-linked with metal complexes (SIMENOVA and DALEV, 1996). The most widespread tanning method is chrome tanning, in which light and inexpensive leathers of high thermal and bacterial resistance are produced using basic chromium sulphate as the tanning agent. Although chromium is a perfect tanning agent in terms of leather performance, three negative attributes pose serious challenges to continued reliance on Cr-tanning: i) it is a limited natural resource, ii) its safety record is cautionary and iii) uncontrolled emission can have a serious environmental impact (Haroun et al., 2006). Recently, titanium has been proposed as a tanning agent, being abundant in nature, easily obtainable, non-toxic even in large doses and it Agrochimica, Vol. LII N. 2 May-June 2008",

    "abstract": "Echinacea angusiifolla DC var. angustifolia is an important medicinal plant which is collected from the wild or cultivated for the roots. However, open-field cultivation is quite difficult and there is increasing interest towards the greenhouse hydroponic culture. In this work, the effect of nitrogen (N) nutrition was investigated on the growth and the root content of selected caffeic acid derivatives (CADs; caftaric acid, chlorogenic acid, echinacoside, caffeic acid, cynarin, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and cichoric acid) in E. angustifolia plants grown in water culture (floating raft system). The plants were fed with nutrient solutions differing for the nitrate/ammonium (N0 3 /NH 4 + ) molar ratio (1:0, 3:1, 1:1) with a total N concentration of 8 mmol L'. Hydroponic culture allowed large root biomass production, which was significantly reduced in the presence of NH 4 + . The roots contained significant amounts of the CADs chlorogenic acid, cynarin and echinacoside. Anyway, in all N treatments the echinacoside level remained well below the minimum quality standard (1% on a dry weight basis) for the production of E. angustifolia extracts.",

An experiment was conducted in 2004 and 2005 in a vineyard located in Spain. Compared with the controls, ethephon-treated plants soon after fruit-set significantly reduced the sprouting of lateral buds, leaf area development, leaf chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis rate as measured at veraison. The reduction of lateral growth in treated plants was compensated by higher growth of principal shoots, keeping total pruning weight unaltered. The application of ethephon after fruit-set did not significantly influence yield or grape composition parameters. In 2004, ethephon spraying at veraison affected must composition by increasing pH, the content of tartaric acid and total acidity.",

Microalgae-derived agar to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural conversion paves the route for algal biomass to liquid fuel transformation. Ionic liquid played a major role in direct conversion of agar to liquid fuel-additive 5-ethoxymethyl-furfural.

    "abstract": "The mineralogical composition of mixed topsoil samples (0-20 cm) from different sites, Mbalmayo (Mb), Mengang (Me) and Nkolbisson (Nk), located in the forest zone of Central Cameroon was determined in order to draw inferences related to chemical fertility. The chemical fertility was assessed on the basis of CEC, nutrient reserves (Ca, Mg and It) in the mineral fraction and P adsorption isotherms. Quartz is the major component in sand and silt fractions while the clay fraction of all soils studied is dominated by kaolinite and Fe oxides (goethite). Weatherable minerals still present are: diopside, enstatite, feldspars and mica. The dominance of kaolinite and Fe oxides is responsible for the low CEC. Nutrient release by the mineral fraction follows the order Ca>Mg>K, although the soils are poor in Ca-bearing minerals. Phosphorus adsorption becomes more important with an increase in clay content and DCB extractable Fe. Adsorption maxima range from 1100 to 2160 mu g P/g. Since in this area, agricultural utilization of lime and P fertilizers is financially prohibitive for the small farmer which is the main crop producer, improvement of the chemical fertility of these soils requires a management strategy that allows the increase of CEC, Ca and P supply possibly through the use of wood industry by-products (wood ash or pulp).",

In response to treatment with three doses of Pr (recommended field dose -f.d.-, half f.d. and double f.d.) significant decreases of total soluble carbohydrates, starch and total protein, which were proportional to the applied dosage, were observed in the shoots during a 16 day period following treatment. This was correlated to reductions in the extractable activity of ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39) as well as of glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) and glutamate synthase (EC 1.4.1.14), which were monitored as parameters of C02 and ammonia-N assimilation, respectively. Despite these effects, the seedlings managed to survive with an almost negligible reduction in dry weight. This seems to be due to the herbicide-induced activity of glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18), which was checked as a parameter of the capacity of the plant to detoxify the herbicide through conjugation with glutathione or homoglutathione.",

Soil samples of 1.4 g were weighed in 25 mL glass tubes and desiccated in an oven at 40, 60, 80 and 1000 C using 2 different moisture levels: dry and wet. A total of 10 treatments were carried out with two replicates per treatment. Soil variables analyzed were: extractable phosphorus (Pe), organic phosphorus (Po), pH, organic carbon (OC), soil microbial activity (SMA), CaCO 3 and texture (sand, silt and clay %). A marked increase in Pe was observed through the combined effect of moisture and temperature. Medium and fine textured soils showed higher Pe increments than coarser textured soils. Whereas in medium textured soils (loam) the increment in Pe varied between 4 mg kg -1 and 8 mg kg 1 as a result of the effect of temperature and temperature plus moisture, respectively, in the case of fine and coarse textured soils (clay loam and loamy sand) the increment was between 1 mg kg' and 6 mg kg 1 . The soil variable analysis did not show any statistically significant relationships for Pe. However, high correlations were found between Po and SMA (r = 0.73, P < 0.0 1) and between SMA and silt content (r = 0.86, P < 0.01). Thus, the results infer that soil microorganisms play an active role in the process of Po mineralization and the consequent increase in Pe.",

MCP addition exerted a negative effect on most of the enzyme activities, and the effect was dependent on the GM rate and incubation period. Our findings confirmed that soil enzyme activities, after the different incubation periods with or without MCP addition, which will benefit GM rational application as soil enzymes are generally considered to be soil quality indicators.",

The study showed an interactive effect between the rate of application of the residues and additional N. Without additional N, the mineral N in soil was completely immobilized within two weeks irrespective of the rate of application; initial net immobilization was limited by the availability of N and was independent of residue rate. When additional N was supplied, initial net immobilization was dependent on the rate of application of the residue. We used the APSIM SoilN module to simulate N mineralization from high C:N ratio crop residues, and compared the predictions with the observed data from our incubation study. Model performance was generally satisfactory, and the model was able to simulate the observed interaction between rate of application of residue and added N. The modelling efficiency, a measure of goodness of fit between the simulation and observed data, was 0.82 for the treatments in the incubation study. The major discrepancy between the model and the observed data was a tendency for the model to underestimate the initial rate of immobilization.",

    "abstract": "Sustained growth and yield can be achieved when adequate quantities of nutrients are regularly returned to the soil. The effects of wood ash and lime on the dynamics of soil nutrients were studied in the laboratory using columns of mixed samples of topsoils from three tropical acid soils (Kandiudult). Amendments were applied to attain 80% base saturation and at amount corresponding to I and 2 times the content of exchangeable Al. The soil columns were leached for a period of 90 days with an amount of deionised water equivalent to the annual rainfall. Available nutrients in the soil was measured with NH(4)OAcEDTA pH 4.65 extract. In general, wood ash affected leachate composition more than lime. Application of wood ash led to increases in concentrations of DOG, NO3, SO4, Ca, Mg and K in the leachates and losses increased with wood ash application rates. Available Ca in the soil subsequent to leaching increased with both wood ash and lime, while available Mg and K increased with wood ash but was not affected with lime. Increases in the leached and available Ca, Mg and K were significant with wood ash application compared to liming. In this particular experimental conditions, an annual maintenance dressing with wood ash of 4.6 t.ha(-1) in soil Mb, 5.7 t.ha(-1) in soil Me and 4.3 t.ha(-1) in soil Nk would provide enough Ca to compensate losses. However, when taking into account simultaneous additions of Mg and K with wood ash, only their leaching losses can be recovered. Therefore, adequate supplementation with ME and K fertilisers is still needed to obtain maximum crop yield for the next growth cycle.",

The grapes were from Falanghina which is a relevant autochthonous vineyard of Southern Italy. To stress results, the analysis considered two different years (2002 and 2003), characterised by very contrasting climatic conditions in terms of both rain and temperature. Differences in the mean values of grape characteristics from one year to another were statistically evaluated using the usual student t-test. Relationships between soil properties and 2002-2003 grape variables were then simultaneously evaluated using the explorative OMCIA-PLSR statistics. OMCIA-PLSR is a new multivariate statistical method for making predictive models and belonging to the class of the explorative data analysis. Titratable acidity (TAc) and malic acid (Mal) were positively correlated to soil total nitrogen (N), exchangeable potassium (K), and organic carbon (OC), whereas tartaric acid (Tar) was negatively related with soil exchangeable calcium (Ca), pH and carbonates (CaCO 3 ). Statistical analysis revealed that the mean weight of cluster and berry did not change during the investigated period, as well as the structure of relationships between soil and grape variables was highly comparable and consistent from one year to another. Contrastingly, the values of grape compositional compounds, as TAc, Mal, tartaric acid (Tar), soluble solids (Brix) and grape pH (GpH) varied significantly from 2002 to 2003 vintage. Results showed that soil and climate independently affect quantitative and qualitative grape features, respectively.",

Moderate use of organic amendments, i.e. sewage sludge, can supply available N and reduce the accelerating use of conventional fertilizers, which may lead to slower nitrate leaching. The aim of this study was to examine nitrate mobility in Mediterranean soils of low organic matter content using soil leaching columns amended with sewage sludge and inorganic fertilizer. Eight soil samples from the Gulf of Kalloni, Lesvos Island, which typically bear the above mentioned characteristics, were used. It was found that sludge application at 10 t ha -1 increased nitrate retention capacity of soils either by rendering a smaller amount of nitrates available to leaching or by reducing the rate of NO 3- N release. Average NO 3- N leaching was 0.016 in control, 0.092 in sludge treatment, and 0.130 in fertilizer treatment (units in mg N kg -1 soil mm -1 eluted water). After about 100 mm of added water, cumulative leaching of NO 3- N reached a plateau in most soils, but nitrate recovery was a fraction of the added, probably due to denitrification- and immobilization- related N losses.",

After a two-week permanence of roots in solution a further decrease of pH occurred with Cr levels between 19 and 57 mg L -1 . In all plant parts the Cr concentration increased with increasing Cr supply, but the Cr concentrations of roots and rhizomes always exceeded by a 100 factor that of the shoot.

    "abstract": "- The aim of the present research was to investigate in the halophyte Hordeum maritimum the production of lipid and antioxidative signals as early response to K + deprivation. In contrast to leaves, roots showed a decrease in K + content which reached a minimum value after 6 hours of treatment. At the end of the experiment, K + content was 25% lower than the control. Phosphatidylation of butanol has been used for an in vivo assay of phospholipase D (PLD) in plant tissues. In the roots, phosphatidylbutanol (PTBut) showed a biphasic trend with two peaks after 2 and 24 hours of potassium deprivation while in the leaves no PTBut formation was observed. In the roots hydrogen peroxide (H 2 Ο 2 ) content increased during K + deprivation with a maximum after 6 hours, decreasing thereafter. The leaves showed a similar trend, although the changes in H 2 Ο 2 were smaller. On the contrary, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity decreased, reaching the minimum value at 6 hours, increasing thereafter. In the leaves after a decrease at 2 hours of treatment, the activity of the enzyme increased slightly. Deprivation of K + behaves as an oxidative stress bringing to the production of H 2 Ο 2 . The secondary activation of PLD at 24 hours of treatment could be due to structural changes of GAPDH, following inactivation by H 2 O 2, which allows PLD to be activated.",

Although a significant increase in NH 4 + -N, protein-N and TN contents was obtained concurrently with a significant greater decrease in NO 3 - -N and TSN contents of the salinized plants fortified with phosphorein, yet addition of nitrobein to the saline culture media induced an additive increase in the contents of all N fractions determined, in relation to respective saline control levels. Furthermore, either an additive significant increase or significant decrease in all P fractions determined was obtained in response to treatment with phosphorein or nitrobein, respectively. The activities of nitrate reductase (NR), asparaginase (AS), glutamine synthetase (GS) and acid phosphatase showed, in general, significant variable increases in response to treatment with phosphorein, as compared with the activities in salinized lettuce plants. On the other hand, these enzyme activities in lettuce plants treated with NaCl in combination with nitrobein biofertilizer, showed additive significant decreases, throughout the entire period of the experiment. The present results with lettuce plants are discussed in relation to applicability of two biofertilizers to sodic salty soils in Egypt.",

    "abstract": "Cadmium and zinc show similarities in their chemistry, geochemistry and environmental properties. Whereas Cd is a phytotoxic non-essential element, Zn is an essential trace element for plant growth and development. Zinc plays a fundamental role in several key cellular functions, such as protein metabolism, gene expression, chromatin structure, photosynthetic carbon metabolism and indole acetic acid metabolism (Vallee and Falchuk, 1993; Marschner, 1995; Bonnet et al., 2000; Cakmak and Braun, 2001). Zinc is also an important component of many enzymes and proteins (Broadley et al., 2007). Cadmium can readily inhibit most of the Zn-dependent processes by binding to the membrane and to enzyme active sites, thus inactivating their functions (Aravind and Prasad, 2005). However, increasing Zn concentrations can replace such wrongly bound Cd (Van Assche and Clijsters, 1990; Shaw et al., 2004). Cadmium has been shown to cause many morphological, physiological, biochemical and structural changes in plants, such as growth inhibition, reduction in photosynthesis, transpiration or water imbalance (Sanita di Toppi and Gabbrielli, 1999; Schutzendubel et al., 2001; Benavides et al., 2005; Mishra et al., 2006). Cadmium and high zinc concentration affect plant growth and metabolism, but the intensity of their toxic effects depends on plant species and the way and duration of metal exposure. Plants called hyperaccumulators are able to tolerate and accumulate extraordinary levels of trace elements in their above-ground tissue without developing any toxicity symptoms (Baker and Brooks, 1989; Reeves and Baker, 2000). Their high metal accumulation capability makes them interesting for the decontamination technique called phytoextraction, which uses plants for environmental clean-up (Salt et al., 1998). However, their low biomass production strongly limits the real application of this soil decontamination strategy. The ideal plant for phytoextraction should provide both a high biomass and a high tolerance and metal accumulation (Schwitzguebel et al., 2002). High biomass producing plants with improved tolerance to trace elements and with an enhanced metal accumulation capacity should be good candidates for metal removal from contaminated area. Previous studies have shown enhanced tolerance and metal accumulation properties in transgenic tobacco plants (Pomponi et al., 2006; Gorinova et al., 2007; Wojas et al., 2008). However, the main disadvantage of genetic engineering is still public acceptance and free-land application. In vitro breeding techniques have also been successfully used to obtain tobacco lines with a considerably enhanced Cd, Zn and Cu tolerance and metal accumulation (Herzig et al., 1997; Guadagnini et al., 1999; Herzig et al., 2003). In addition, the chemical mutagen ethyl methane sulphonate has been used to develop new sunflower lines with a significantly enhanced biomass and metal uptake on a metal contaminated field (Nehnevajova et al., 2007, 2009). Although these field experiments have revealed the potential of sunflower mutants for metal phytoextraction, their tolerance to trace elements and the effect of Cd and Zn on growth and photosynthetic pigments were not studied within previous free-land experimentation. The aim of the present work was thus to assess the tolerance to Cd and excess Zn of selected sunflower mutant lines with improved biomass and metal uptake capacity, by measuring different physiological parameters. For such a purpose, sunflower seedlings of eight selected mutant lines were cultivated under hydroponic conditions in the presence and in the absence of Cd and Zn to study the effect of these trace elements on (1) growth parameters, such as root elongation, root and shoot dry mass; (2) chlorophyll content; (3) carotenoid content; (4) Cd and Zn accumulation capacity of sunflower mutants; and (5) a possible correlation between Cd and Zn accumulation in sunflower shoots and roots.",

    "abstract": "After the application of a pesticide, only a part of it has an effect on the target, while other part of the pesticide circulates in different environments turning into an environmental risk. In Chile, one of the pesticides widely used is chlorpyrifos (CLP), where the highest percentage is traded at the VI Region. The objective of this study was to quantify the biodegradation of CLP in two Soil Series (Fluventic Haploxerolls) from the VI Region, using a labeled chlorpyrifos with 14 Carbon ( 14 C-CLP) in the molecular structure. The biodegradation of CLP was measured for a soil incubation period of 69 days for the Serie O'Higgins (S 1 ), and 57 days for Serie Rancagua (S 2 ). Every three days the 14 Co 2 produced was quantified, also the total 14 C-CLP bound and extractable residues in the soil were measured during the process. The results showed that 50 % of the biodegradation was attained after 40 days of incubation for S 1 , and 24 days in S 2 , while at the end of the total period 59.5 % and 61.3 % of pesticide were biodegraded for S 1 and S 2 , respectively. As an approach the GUS index was assessed assuming the 50 % of the CLP biodegradation as the CLP half life, representing a value of 1.38 for S 1 and 0.79 for S 2 . These indexes indicate CLP as a non leachable product and a low potential risk of groundwater contamination.",

Besides this, other (heavy and light) metals are absorbed by plants both from aerosol deposited on leaves and via the roots. Since the uptake rates of different metals are linked by biochemical factors, it should be feasible to correlate magnetic signals from leaves/needles which are due to magnetite to the burden of other, toxic heavy metals. If this be proven, there are ramifications for biomonitoring escaping the need and expenses of traditional analytics. In this paper, thermodynamic and biochemical (bioinorganic) requirements for magnetite formation and doing this kind of biomonitoring are discussed.",

The results from different biochemical analyses showed that increase in NaCl concentration in the growth medium reduced the activities of a-amy-lase and protease in the germinating seeds of all three rice cultivars examined, however, the reduction in enzymatic activities was more pronounced in cv. 38/88 than that in the other cultivars. A decrease in the concentration of reducing and non-reducing sugars in the germinating seeds of all cultivars was observed, particularly during the period from 24 to 72 h. The decrease in sugar content in the germinating seeds was found to be attributable to salt-induced reduction in a-amylase activity. Similarly, as a result of salt-induced reduction in protease activity, a decrease in the breakdown of reserve proteins and accumulation of amino acids were recorded in the germinating seeds of all cultivars. Under saline conditions cv. IRRI-6 followed by NIAB-IRRI-9 was the highest, whereas cv. 38/88 the lowest in germination, growth, α-amylase and protease activities, reduc-ing and non-reducing sugars. Overall, the three rice cultivars, known for their different degree of salt tolerance at the adult stage, maintained their respective salt tolerance potential at the germination stage.",

There was a decrease in dry matter yield due to phytotoxic effect of Pb as a result of its application. The rate of Pb application, at which significant decline in dry matter yield of root and shoot occurred, varied depending on the vegetable. It was 120 and 80 mg Pb kg ' soil in both roots and shoots for pig-weed and brinjal respectively. Both pig-weed and brinjal exhibited toxicity symptoms of Pb in the form of interveinal chlorosis with necrosis and scorching at the margin of the leaves in treatments receiving 160 mg Pb kg -1 and above. The reduction in root and shoot growth was in agreement with the amounts of extractable Pb in the soils. The total content of Pb in crops increased gradually with graded rates of applied Pb and roots accumulated much higher amount than shoot. The relationship of Pb with Zn and Mn was antagonistic in both roots and shoots while in case of Fe, it was synergistic in roots and antagonistic in shoots for both crops. The relationship of Cu with Pb was very weak.",

Puis durant la phase de maturation, les quantites de la fraction echangeable de Pb et de Cu continuent a baisser, alors que celle de Zn et de Cd augmentent.",

    "abstract": "The ammonia losses under field conditions vary widely and these nitrogen losses can decrease crops yield. However, experiment with wheat in the Argentinean Pampas showed that yields are not related to the volatilization losses of several nitrogen fertilizers. We hypothesize that ammonia volatilization from urea was compensated with higher apparent soil mineralization rate and then, even with high ammonia volatilization from urea, wheat yields were not affected. We evaluated ammonia volatilization, apparent nitrogen mineralization, apparent nitrogen uptake efficiency, and their effects on wheat yields. The experiment was carried out with wheat grown in a no-till Typic Hapludoll, using urea, UAN and IBDU. Ammonia losses were 17.1% and 4.7% of N applied as urea and UAN, respectively; IBDU and control were low. Wheat yields were not affected by ammonia losses. The N uptake and N export was greater in fertilized treatments. For urea, the highest volatilization rate was compensated by the highest soil mineralization rate. From the sustainable agriculture point of view, the volatilization would be dangerous because the soil could tend to compensate that loss, thus impoverishing itself in native nitrogen.",

This study was conducted to determine the relationship between soil chemical and microbial properties, root growth, and platycodin D content in the roots of Platycodon grandiflorum . Our results showed that available P, exchangeable Na, and soil microbial properties have significant correlation with the root growth of P. grandiflorum ; while total C, exchangeable Na, and soil microbial properties have significant correlation with the platycodin D content in P. grandiflorum roots. Significant correlations between chemical and microbial properties in P. grandiflorum soils at different plant growth stages were also determined. Establishment of the relationship between soil chemical and microbial properties with the root growth and platycodin D content in P. grandiflorum roots is important to understand the factors affecting nutrient availability in soils which may have an overall effect on the growth and quality of P. grandiflorum .",

The production ethylene is generally higher in tomato than in kiwifruits. A specific goal of the experiment as to elucidate the possible interaction between cutting damage and low storage injuries on tissue deterioration over time at both chilling temperature (4 ° C) and no-chilling temperature. (15°C) in the two species. The experiments were conducted using closed or holed containers. Closed containers were used to allow ethylene and CO 2 accumulation in the internal atmosphere over time. Electrolyte leakage was affected by cutting operation to produce tomato slices but not for kiwifruit slices upon storage at 4 ° C. When temperature was 15°C in both the species an increase in electrolyte leakage was observed at the end of storage. Cutting stimulates ethylene production in tissue derived from slices of kiwifruit and tomato that in turns lead to an increase in the hormone concentration inside the containers. Ethylene accumulation and membrane leakage are two independently consequences of cutting and the hormone accumulation do not exacerbate loss of membrane integrity. Moreover, low storage temperature (4°C) reduces loss of membrane integrity of fresh-cut tomato and enhances quality of fresh-cut kiwifruit compared to storage at no chilling temperature.",

Corn (Zea mays L.) was used as a plant-test for the pot experiment. Plants were harvested four weeks after sowing. The dry matter, P uptake as well as soil extractable P were determined. Phosphorus adsorption was investigated on soil samples of the pot experiment. Application of a P-fertilizer increased extractable P and decreased the P adsorption capacity of the soil. This resulted in increased P uptake by plants. The beneficial effects brought about wood ash, notably the increased pH neutralisation of exchangeable Al in the soil, enhanced P response similar to that found in non acid soils. In these conditions, P uptake was correlated positively to extractable P and negatively to P adsorption maxima. The close relationships obtained between P adsorption maxima and extractable P can be used as a means of estimating P- fertilizer recommendations. This presumes a positive response to P-fertilizers in tropical acid soils after slash and burn. Field studies must be undertaken to confirm this findings and to determine the influence of some factors.",

The results indicated that NPK (+S) applied for 13 years at 50%, 100% and 150% of optimum recommended rates and 100% NPK (+S) with farmyard manure (FYM) increased the organic C and total N status of soil as compared to control and their initial status. Intensive cropping with continuous use of 100% NPK without S resulted in depletion of total, organic and inorganic S concentrations by 10.7, 10.3 and 19.4%, respectively over control while in plots that received graded rates of S with NPK and NPK plus FYM their status got improved. Phosphate extractable inorganic S was found to be a better index of soil S mineralisation than organic and inorganic S fractions extracted by NaHCO 3 and NaOH. Cumulative amounts of S mineralised during 14 week incubation period in various treatments varied between 5.6 and 31.5 mg S kg - 1 soil and increased with increase in the rates of S applied along with NPK fertilisers. Incorporation of FYM with 100% NPK(+S) resulted in greater cumulative mineralised S over 100% NPK(+S) alone. The cumulative mineralised S showed a quadratic relationship with the duration of incubation in all the treatments.",

Genetic diversity of all landraces estimated by Nei's genetic diversity ranged from 0.000 to 0.498 and Shannon diversity index ranged from 0.000 to 0.691. The clustering algorithm divided the varieties into three major groups. Results revealed that RAPD markers could be efficiently used to quickly differentiate local landraces obtained from different locations.

Regression equation showed that 71, 64, 62, 62, 59 and 39 per cent variations in WS-B, HWS-B, HCC-B, HCI-B, Mann-B and ABDTPA-B contents were governed by soil texture and organic carbon alone while more than 95 per cent variation was due to combined effect of all the soil properties. HWS-B and HCC-B contributed 1.61 to 6.84 and 1.75 to 6.03 per cent respectively towards total B pool in soils.",

    "abstract": "Sunflower plants (cv. Katharina) were grown in lysimeters (1 m 3 ) and irrigated with fresh water as a control, and with increasing sea water concentrations, 16 and 33%, with LF1 and LF2 as leaching fractions, respectively. Sunflower leaves were harvested at the 15 th leaf formation (stage I), crown opening-flowering starting (stage II) and full flowering-achenes formation (stage III). The increases in Na + and Cl - induced by sea water treatments may be a direct consequence of their higher uptake and translocation due to the highest salt concentration in the soil. Nonetheless the increase in Ca 2+ contents counterbalanced the deleterious effects of Na + . Salinity also induced a significant decrease of NO 3 - contents. The Na + /Ca 2+ and Cl - /NO 3 - ratios increased significantly with the increase in salinity. Following sea water treatments, the contents of total nitrogen and protein decreased during plant growth; on the contrary, proline content increased suggesting its possible contribute in sunflower protection against salinity.",

Salt stress was induced by sodium chloride in WPM medium (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 160 mM). Salinity affected water and mineral content of organs analyzed for P. imperialis and P. fortunei. Leaf areas, as well as fresh and dry weight, were reduced by increments of salt conditions in both species. P. imperialis and P. fortunei contain high Na* in leaves, stems, and roots with increasing NaCl concentrations. The concentrations of K + , Ca ++ and Mg ++ decreased significantly in P. imperialis. The concentrations of k + and Ca ++ decreased in the aerial part of the plant, while Mg ++ did not change at 15 days with the increments of NaCl concentrations in P. fortunei. These results indicate that both species grow at 60 mM NaCl, but higher NaCl concentrations cause necroses and death. These results indicate that both Paulownia species are slightly tolerant to Na + salinity.",

The soil samples, collected after a triennial lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv Bacio) cultivation, were equilibrated using six B concentrations (0, 1, 5, 20, 50, 100 mg B L -1 , as H 3 BO 3 ). Sorption processes were fitted to linear forms of the Freundlich, Langmuir and Temkin equations. Boron adsorption data were well described by Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, while the Temkin showed a lowest fit. All fertilized plots showed higher intensity of adsorption (Freundlich 1/n range 0.617-0.765 L kg -1 ), and applications of distiller's residue plus anaerobic digestate and organic-mineral fertilizer to soils increased the maximum adsorption and buffering capacity, with the Langmuir and Temkin models, respectively. The Freundlich intensity of adsorption 1/n was positively correlated with the Langmuir maximum adsorption Xm and Temkin buffering capacity b. Boron desorption data fitted well with the Freundlich isotherm (high R 2 values), and the desorption intensity coefficients, 1/n 1 , increased with the application of fertilizers. Comparison of desorption to adsorption Freundlich isotherms showed that there was a total reversibility of adsorbed boron for all fertilized plots, well explained by the desorption index values <1. Freundlich isotherm proved more effective in describing B desorption in soils as compared to Langmuir and Temkin equations.",

    "abstract": "No reliable soil test is currently available to assess the potassium (K) status of calcareous soils of Iran. Therefore, the relative efficiency of 10 extractants to predict potentially available K to lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) was evaluated in 27 calcareous soils. The extracting capacity of the extractants was quite different, being highest for HNO 3 and lowest for CaCl 2 . The amounts of K extracted were highly correlated among chemical soil tests; the only exception was a non-significant relationship between HNO 3 -K and CaCl 2 -K. The variability in the soil K displaced by the extractants was best explained by cation exchange capacity (CEC) and silt content followed by calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE). The coefficients of determination among extractable K and rice shoot dry weight and K uptake were significant. However, K extracted by each soil test was more closely correlated with plant K uptake than with dry weight. The highest correlation was observed among K uptake and Sr-citrate-K and modified Kelowna-K, and the lowest with HNO 3 -K. Inclusion of soil properties improved the prediction power of plant-available K. Furthermore, the silt content had the most influential role in the prediction capability of K soil test. The results show that modified Kelowna, Sr-citrate and DTPA-NH 4 HCO 3 are appropriate extractants to estimate potentially available K for paddy rice in highly calcareous soils of Iran. However, relatively high variability in soil characteristics justifies an urgent need for more correlation and field calibration studies to improve K availability indices.",

The comparisons between management systems showed that organic matter content (OM) was notably higher at Al site (1.84%). On the other hand, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and clay contents were greater at A2 site (35 cmol kg -1 , 56%) while A3 site contained elevated levels of sand (29%) and CaCO 3 (21%) due to variable soil surface erosion at different land use. The trace metal contents (Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn) were higher at Al and A2 sites, but A3 and A4 sites showed a gradual decrease. The higher Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn contents in Al and A2 sites could be attributed to variable rates of fertilizer and pesticides applications and limited surface erosion.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationships between the antioxidant capacity and the microbial activity in a soil amended with different organic materials.In a 1year laboratory incubation, biochar, green compost and vermicompost were added to soil at the dose of 2.5% w/w.Antioxidant capacity (TEAC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), water-and alkali-soluble phenols and microbial activity, as measured by the fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA), were monitored during incubation.Greater TEAC was in green compost and vermicompost than in biochar treated soil and it was directly related on the TEAC values of the added materials.The application of organic materials caused a marked increase of DOC and water-and alkali-soluble phenols, with values reflecting the amount of these compounds present in the amendments.The relationships between values of TEAC and phenols in the treatments suggest that these substances may be involved in determining the antioxidant capacity of soil.Compared to control, FDA was not influenced by B at each sampling time, probably because the inhibiting activity of TEAC of the material.The two types of compost, particularly vermicompost, stimulated FDA throughout the whole experimental period.Any possible inhibition of the microbial activity induced by TEAC of vermicompost and green compost could have been masked by the considerable supply of organic soluble compounds of composts, that may have stimulated strongly the microorganisms.These results suggest that the",

About 90% of total phosphorus losses in runoff over the study period were in the fine-particle-associated phosphorus fraction. Since 89% of total bioavailable phosphorus losses in runoff (by extraction with 0.11 M NaOH) were in particulate form, particle-associated-phosphorus clearly makes a major contribution to diffuse pollution. Vegetation cover was a key factor: once cover exceeded 70-80%, fine particle erosion in runoff dropped below the detection limit (0.01 g 1 - 1 ). As a consequence, the benefits of phosphate application can be considered to outweigh the disadvantages.",

Short-time repeated applications of linuron and metolachlor caused enhanced degradation of the two chemicals. The effect was stable for linuron and transient for metolachlor. In soil samples receiving from one to five short-time repeated treatments of metolachlor or linuron, no significant decrease of biomass C with respect to control soil was observed. A decrease of soil biomass C was observed in soil samples receiving an additional metolachlor or linuron treatment which was done 160 days from the previous one. This study suggests that degradation of two different herbicides can be forced to accelerate rates by repeated short-time applications of the same active ingredient, although magnitude and persistence of the phenomenon depends on the type of herbicides.",

A higher C.O.D. concentration in the irrigation water also resulted in an overall increase of the dry matter yield and metal concentrations in the plant tissue. Addition of 5% clay to the acidic soil reduced these effects. The clay content of the soil was by far the most important factor in controlling plant growth and metal uptake.",

Soil boron has been determined according to the hot water method and fractioned in five distinct fractions.

The > and > fractions are negligible and represent together 1.18% of total boron. The residual fraction constitutes the most important fraction and represents 78.75%. Intermediate fractions represent together 20.08%, of which 8.04% is bound to oxydes and 12.04% is bound to organic matter. \r\nThe soil characteristics that most influenced the different forms of soil boron are cation exchange capacity, texture, organic matter and pH. Highly significant correlations have been observed between these soil characteristics and some forms of soil boron. \r\nBoron uptake by barley was higher than the quantities of boron corresponding to the > and > fractions. This means that other forms, including organic matter bound-form and probably also oxydes bound-form, participated in boron nutrition of the plants.",

    "abstract": "During recent years many golf courses have been constructed along the Mediterranean coast. More are still planned in spite of water resources being insufficient for other existing essential uses. Water demand for such courses (quantity and frequency) depends on the hydraulic properties of the soil in addition to the climatic characteristics of the locality and type of vegetation introduced. For this reason it is considered essential as a water saving strategy to specifically determine the hydraulic properties of the substrates that are most often used to build golf greens. For the efficient management of irrigation on golf courses it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the soil moisture characteristics. These are intrinsically related to the matrix where water is retained. The behaviour of water in the soil, and its availability to be extracted by the plants, is mainly determined by the pF curves which mainly depend on soil composition, texture and organic matter content. The behaviour of soil moisture characteristic curves for sands are tested for differing amounts of peat content, often used as substrate for building green's golf courses. Siliceous sand with a 20% (v/v) of peat is shown to have the highest amount of water reserve available for grass development.",

The observed increase varied from 22.7 to 192.8%, 19.8 to 82.1%, and 3.2 to 15.1% for iron, zinc and manganese respectively. \r\nThe behaviour of copper was different from that of iron, zinc and manganese, in that the addition of manure associated with that of copper induced a significant decrease in copper concentration in the plant which varied from 7.1 to 50.0%. However, when no copper was added, manure applications induced an increase in plant copper concentration which varied from 11.7 to 58.8%.",

Des differences quantitatives ont ete relevees en comparant les extraits phenoliques de 7 cultivars etudies pour leur degre d'attraction ou de repulsion vis-a-vis de l'insecte ravageur. Globalement, les jeunes pousses et les grappes florales des cultivars les plus repulsifs presentent des teneurs elevees en phenols par rapport aux cultivars les plus attractifs vis-a-vis de l'insecte. Parmi les nombreux composes phenoliques mis en evidence, le 3,4 dihydroxyphenylethanol parait etre positivement relie a la repulsion des cultivars. Par ailleurs, il ressort que l'attraction preferentielle de l'insecte par les grappes florales durant la periode de floraison peut etre expliquee, en partie, par leur teneur 2 a 3 fois plus faible en phenols par comparaison aux jeunes pousses. De meme, ce travail revele que les degâts les plus importants (chute des jeunes pousses, des grappes florales et des jeunes fruits) ont lieu durant la periode ou le materiel vegetal presente une faible teneur en phenols. L'importance des composes phenoliques dans le phenomene d'attraction ou de repulsion de l'insecte par les cultivars d'Olivier est discutee.",

    "abstract": "A field experiment was conducted using furrow-irrigated Burley tobacco (cv. C104) to compare two deficit irrigation treatments with a full irrigation treatment (control). Two deficit irrigation treatments (50% ETC), imposed either using every row deficit irrigation (DI 50 ) or partial root-zone drying (PRD 50 ), were compared with a full irrigation treatment (100% ETC, FI control). In the DI 50 treatment plants received half of the volume of water uniformly applied to both sides of the row, whereas in the PRD 50 treatment one-half of the root zone was wetted while the other half was maintained dry, thereby the half amount of irrigation water was applied; in particular, the wetted and dry zones were interchanged in two subsequent irrigations. The yield of cured leaves of DI 50 and PRD 50 treatments was 69 and 90% of that of the control, respectively. The dry matter at commercial harvest of DI 50 and PRD 50 was 56 and 88% of the control, respectively. The irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of DI 50 and PRD 50 treatments, expressed as kg of cured leaves ha -1 mm -1 of water applied, was 136 and 179% of the control, respectively. At commercial harvest, N accumulated by both DI 50 and PRD 50 plants was 40% or negligible less, respectively, than that accumulated by FI plants. PRD 50 plants showed a greater accumulation of NO 3 -N than plants of other treatments in the second part of growth, although differences were significant with respect to DI 50 but not to FI plants. Considering leaves only, NO 3 -N content showed a trend similar to that reported for the whole plant. Deficit irrigation practice, and PRD 50 in particular, appears an interesting method to supply and save water for Burley tobacco grown in semi-arid areas.",

These strains were collected from the roots of alders and willows located along waterways in regions of the Walloon area of Belgium where there is a low anthropogenic Cd contamination or where there is a naturally high background of Cd of geological origin. Using an in vitro test is practical for screening quickly several ECM fungal strains. The ECM fungal strains studied here showed a variability of responses to the presence of Cd. Most of the strains did not seem to be affected by Cd. In addition, most of the sensitive strains showed a significantly reduced biomass production with increasing Cd concentrations and these came from the soils of Hainaut and Namur. This observation would suggest that elevated Cd concentrations in soils of origin might play a role in selection pressure in the ECM fungal community.",

Livestock based land-use (FSl), Forestry (FS2), Agriculture (FS3), Agri-horti- silvipastoral (FS4) and Natural fallow (FS5) regularly receiving/not receiving fertilizer P and manure was studied after 17 years of their establishment on an acid Alfisol on hilly slopes. The soils of various land-use systems varied widely in their P sorption behaviour with variable P built up in different systems. The P sorption was higher in the soils of natural fallow land-use system and progressively decreased with the application of manures/P + manures in livestock, agri-horti-silvipastoral and agriculture land-use. Phosphate sorption data fitted well to the classical Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation. Different land-use systems had no effect on adsorption maxima (b) while, bonding energy (k), maximum phosphate buffering capacity (MPBC) and standard P requirement (SPR) were highest for natural fallow followed by forestry land use. In contrast, livestock, agri-horti-silvipastoral and agriculture land-use recorded lower values of these P adsorption parameters indicating higher P availability in these systems. The P fractionation before and after equilibrium with added P showed a wide variation in the build up of various forms of P in different land-use systems which reflected in the variable adsorption of P in these land-use systems under study.",

These soils were fertilized with pig slurry for three consecutive years, in different periods, at a constant rate of 0.6 t N ha -1 year -1 in experi- mental plots cropped with maize (Zea mays L.). The increases of soil K.,ch observed for soil 3 (clay with △ MAX exch estimated 162.6 mg kg -1 ) showed values significantly (P < 0.01) greater than the other two soils (soil 2 silty-clay-loam with a value estimated for △ max exch 72.6 mg kg -1 and soil 1 silt-loam with estimated △ Max ;K exch , 38.1 mg kg -1 ). The difference in the estimated cumulated amounts of exch among the three soil types is due to the higher clay content and C.E.C. of soil 3, and to the higher slope values present in soils 1 and 2 respect to soil 3. For soil 3 only a sig-nificant inverse correlation (P < 0.01 and r = -0.945) was observed between △K exch and applied with slurry. The amounts of taken up by the crops were only slightly cor-related with the applied K: soil 2 (r = 0.804; tot. rec. = 33.3% K), soil 1 (r = 0.785; tot. rec. = 35.6% K) and soil 3 (r = 0.581 ; tot. rec. = 39.8% K). The values of unaccounted-for were, on average, significantly lower (P < 0.01) for soil 3 (17.4%) compared to soil 1 (58.3%) and soil 2 (59.5%).

As a whole, COM and MT soils exhibit the best structure. In COM a noticeable percentage of elongated transmission pores is mostly represented, probably related to high humic fraction amounts. In T low macroporosity values point out the occurrence of compact soil.",

Soil chemical properties such as sulphate formation, pH, soil electrical conductivity (EC), total and extractable organic carbon (TOC and TEC), and biochemical parameters such as microbial biomass carbon content (MBC) and total hydrolytic capacity (FDA-hydrolysis), arylsulphatase (ArS-ase) and o-diphenoloxidase (o-DPO), were monitored. Commercial parameters of yield and quality production of sugar beet (yield of roots, % of polarization, extractable saccharose content and purity of thick juice) were also determined. All soil chemical and biochemical properties and commercial parameters of sugar beet were monitored in plots treated with 1 (S1), 5 (S5) and 10 (S10) t ha -1 of sulphur by-product and compared with untreated plots (SO). In S1, 60 days after amendment the highest values of sulphate formed (310 mg kg -1 ) and the EC (1596 μS cm -1 ), were observed. In S5, the sulphate formed was 2583 mg kg' and soil EC was 4138 μS cm -1 after 210 days, while in S10 the amount of sulphur added probably exceeded soil oxidation capacity since it continued more slowly till the end of the experiment. After 210 days, soil pH reached the lowest value in all the treated plots and it was 7.75, 7.52 and 7.26 in S1, S5 and S10, respectively. No significant modifications were made on soil biochemical parameters tested by the different amounts of sulphur added. A decrease in the production yield of sugar beet (27.2%) was found only when the highest amount of sulphur was applied. In contrast, no worsening of main commercial parameters was observed.",

It was found in chemical fractionation that aluminum phosphate (Al-P) was the main reaction product in MAP and MCP treatments; but in DAP treatment, water soluble P (We-P) was the dominant fraction. Compared with the broad interpretation of P forms in chemical fractionation, FTIR-PAS combined with partial least square (PLS) regression model can give us deep sight about the mineral phase of P in each broad fraction.

Specific respiration was calculated as BR/C mic . BR varied through growth season in the both ecosystems and native pasture generally had greater BR than long-term cultivated soil. The highest BR was observed in October at native pasture. However, qCO 2 was generally greater in long-term cultivated soil compared to native pasture. qCO 2 and C mic were negatively correlated at all layers of both management systems. There was not a significant dependency between soil water content and BR in Fluvaquentic Haplustolls. Thus, long-term cultivation increased qCO 2 which varied through growth season.

Trees that were fertilized with 24.5 nitrogen (N) units (kg 0.1 ha -1 ) showed very high soil total N concentrations. When 15.5 and 20.5 N units were applied in forms of 21-8-11 and 15-15-15 slow release fertilizers, soil total N concentrations were found within the sufficiency range. Fruit weight was lower when 24.5 N units applied compared to 20.5 and 15.5 N units. The lowest preharvest fruit drop was recorded at 15.5 N units, whereas high percentages were measured at 24.5 N units. The length of shoots at the 24.5 N units was excessive, leading to shading of the lower branches. Significant correlations were computed between total soil N of the sampling of August of 2007 and leaf N (r 2 = 0.71, significant at P<0.001 ), fruit weight (r 2 = -0.57, significant at P<0.001), leaf chlorophyll content (r 2 = 0.66, significant at P<0.001), shoot length (r 2 = 0.59, significant at P<0.001), fruit firmness (r 2 = -0.51, significant at P<0.001) and total soluble solids (r 2 = 0.48, significant at P<0.001). In conclusion, application of 15.5 N units supported by 15-15-15 and 26-0-0 slow release fertilizers, contributes for having adequate N during the whole vegetative period for tree growth and development and the attainment of high productivity.",

The concentration of the organic acids determined was always higher in the roots of P-deficient plants as compared to +P plants. The root total malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity was similar in P-deficient and control plants up to 18 days of growth. On the other hand, the activity of the mitochondrial isoforms in -P plants was lower than in the control.

The aim of this work was to study the physiological and molecular characteristics of fast-growing rhizobia strain under different osmolarity, pH and aeration conditions. In addition, the symbiotic performance of strain under greenhouse conditions has been taken into consideration. Initial values of pH 6, aeration of 367 O 2 .l-1.h-1, and osmolarity of 100 mM NaCl were chosen as combined stress conditions for the cultivation of the strain. High concentration of cell suspensions was obtained after their adaptation to different stress conditions, reaching values of 109cfu/ml approximately. It was established that - under such conditions - cell LPSs profiles were not modified. However, the concentration of biosynthesized EPS increased under adverse conditions of growth (pH 6 and osmolarity of 50-100 mM) contrarily to what happened with the controls (pH 7 and 2 mM NaCl). Moreover, the symbiotic potential of fast-growing soybean rhizobia, obtained in adverse conditions for bacterial growth, has been evaluated. None of the rhizobia produced nodules with the American soybean cultivar under greenhouse, because these cellular suspensions did not meet the conditions required for them to be used as inoculants. On the other hand, soybean plants inoculated with the reference fast-growing strains SMH12 demonstrated good nodulation (170 nodules /pot). Even though statistic analysis did not show significant differences in data obtained from % dry weight and % nitrogen, plants showed, nevertheless, a great development and high nitrogen content in all the tests in which they had been inoculated, as compared with the non-inoculated control this was produced independently of the condition in which the bacterial strain was obtained we can conclude that the tests performed with s.fredii usda205 show a pgpr (growth promoting) effect on soybean plantS instead of a nitrogen fixation symbiotic relationship, evidenced by the absence of nodulation in all of the tests.",

The samples were leached periodically with CaCl 2 and N-free nutrient solution and the concentration of NH + 4- N and NO - 3- N was determined in the leachates. NO - 3- N was the predominant fraction. The mineralized nitrogen (Nm) can be described by a first order kinetics model obtained by a non linear regression analysis. The amount of Nm produced, was greater in KAL sludge, followed by LAR and KAT. The potentially mineralizable nitrogen (No) follows the order NoKAT<NoLAR< NoKAL, which was probably attributed to the degree of polymerization of the organic matter and the percent of total nitrogen and of humic acid's N.",

Statistically higher biomass yield was recorded in CSLT12, CSLT9 and CSLT13 as compared to other germplasms. However, oil yield in CSLT13 was almost double than in CSLT9 and CSLT12, thus indicating that the higher herbage yield does not always result in a higher oil yield. CSLT5 was of the linalool chemotype (European type) yielding more than 60% linalool in its oil whereas CSLT13 and CSLT9 could be classified as methyl chavicol chemotypes (Reunion types) yielding 68% and 56% of methyl chavicol, respectively. The accessions CSLT12 and CSLT12-1 were found as Bulgarian types which yielded more than 41% of methyl chavicol and 29% of linalool with appreciable content (> 5.00%) of methyl cinnamate. The presence of other important mono- and sesqui- terpenes in these genotypes was also investigated and discussed.

An evaluation of some enzyme activities and soil basal respiration as biological soil parameters to monitor soil status and quality during the decontamination process from total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) was carried out. Three samples were used: S (control, uncontaminated soil), CS (contaminated soil), SCS (sterilized contaminated soil). The relationships between soil parameters and the levels of TPH residues were investigated. Results showed large loss of TPH, ranging between 28% and 40%, due to volatilization in all treatments during the first 10-d incubation period. The most effective biodegradation ability was in organic and coarse-textured soils. TPH strongly inhibited enzyme activities, mainly lipase and dehydrogenase. The soil respiration dynamics was reproduced satisfactorily by a kinetic model able to fit a flush of C mineralization followed by a stabilization phase. β-glucosidase activity and basal respiration were the best biochemical parameters for monitoring soil status and quality during the bioremediation process.",

The I:E ratio is the ratio between a fixed depth of irrigation water and cumulative pan evaporation from Class A open pan, less rainfall since previous irrigation. Yield components and pod yield were significantly affected by both irrigation depth and I:E ratio. Water use efficiency was higher in the 2nd year. The higher I:E ratio proved to be inferior in terms of water use efficiency. I:E ratio of 0.75 was recommended for cv. SB XI as the optimum irrigation index for potential yield and water use efficiency in the prevailing agroclimatic conditions. To ensure adequate moisture in the effective root zone, 6 cm net irrigation was considered to be the best irrigation depth",

Three treatments were carried out: uncontaminated soil (S) (control), soil contaminated with 10,000mg of diesel oil kg -1 of soil (CS), and contaminated soil plus surfactant Tween 80 at 3% w/w (CSS). Microbial respiration, seed germination index, and dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, and lipase enzyme activities were monitored during incubation. The relationships between soil biological parameters and the TPH levels of the total were investigated. Results indicate that the extent of TPH degradation, of about 50% either in CS and CSS, resulted positively related with microbial respiration and negatively with soil lipase activity. The hydrocarbons depressed seed germination index, while the addition of the surfactant showed a positive effect, counterbalancing the negative influence of TPH. The addition of the surfactant increased the degradation rate of hydrocarbons, microbial respiration and dehydrogenase and lipase activities, as well as germination index, while it had no effect on β-glucosidase activity. The best biochemical parameters for testing hydrocarbon degradation and for monitoring the contamination of diesel oil polluted soil were lipase activity and soil respiration.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present research was to study the effect of B toxicity on seasonal accumulation of nutrients in leaves of kiwifruit vines. Two experimental orchards (A and B) were used. Orchard (A) was irrigated withhigh B water (3.2 mg B L - 1 ) while orchard (B) which served as control was irrigated with good quality water (0.3 mg B L - 1 ). The seasonal patterns for the various macro and micronutrients could be broadly grouped into four types. The first of these patterns was for potassium. Potassium concentration of leaves declined steadily throughout the season in both orchards. The second pattern was for nitrogen, phosphorus and zinc, where the high concentrations in the leaves during the first sampling date declined rapidly during the following 3 sampling dates to reach values which remained relatively constant for the remainder of the season for both orchards. The third pattern was for magnesium, iron and manganese. The concentrations of these elements in leaves declined during the first and the second sampling date but then increased for the remainder of the season. The fourth pattern was for boron and calcium. The concentrations of these elements in leaves increased steadily throughout the season. With regards to the effect of B toxicity on the concentration of the rest nutrients, it was found that leaf K, N, P, Mg and Zn concentrations were not significantly affected, whereas Ca and Mn concentrations decreased indicating that B toxicity affects Ca and Mn absorption and/or transport.",

The results obtained showed that the different parts of sunflower (leaves, steam, head, roots) were affected by the decrease of water availability. The reductions observed vary from 2.5 to 50.3%, 4.8 to 31.7% and 4.8 to 65.3%, for dry matter, boron concentration and boron uptake respectively. The different parts of sunflower reacted with the same intensity. The mean reductions observed in the dry matter were 21.7%, 23.1%, 23.9% and 23.9% for the leaves, the steam, the head and the roots respectively. Those observed in boron uptake were 32.8%, 34.9%, 32.5% and 36.1% for the leaves, the steam, the head and the roots respectively. This decrease was more important for the calcareous soil compared to the non-calcareous soil. Boron translocation from roots to shoots varied from 45.4 to 57.0%, 17.3 to 21.1% and 17.0 to 22.2% for the leaves, the steam and the head respectively.",

    "abstract": "The study of the complexation of calcium by humic substances (SH) extracted from a natural peat (TN) and from a peat treated with nitrogen oxides (TT) was followed by conductimetry and potentiometry with pH variable and pH constant. The complexing capacity increases as the pH rises: complexed calcium is 130 cmol kg*[-1) SH (TN) and 135 cmol kg*[-1) SH (TT) with pH 5, and 330 cmol kg*[-1) SH (TN) and 410 cmol kg*[-1) SH (TT) with pH 9. These reactions involve various functional groupings of pKa1 < 4 for TN and TT, pKa2 = 5.9 for TN and pKa2 = 6.2 for TT; in all cases, the medium has exhibited an increase in acidity. The complexation of calcium by HS extracted from TT could then enhance the efficiency of the phosphatic nutrition of plants.",

Lo zolfo delle radici non presentava alcuna correlazione con il tipo di estraente. La produzione di sostanza secca era correlata con lo zolfo estratto con KH2PO4 e con S riducibile con HI.
