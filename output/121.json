    "abstract": "The aim of the English NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme is to reduce the risk of sight loss amongst people with diabetes by the prompt identification and effective treatment if necessary of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy, at the appropriate stage during the disease process. In order to achieve the delivery of evidence-based, population-based screening programmes, it was recognised that certain key components were required. It is necessary to identify the eligible population in order to deliver the programme to the maximum number of people with diabetes. The programme is delivered and supported by suitably trained, competent, and qualified, clinical and non-clinical staff who participate in recognised ongoing Continuous Professional Development and Quality Assurance schemes. There is an appropriate referral route for those with screen-positive disease for ophthalmology treatment and for assessment of the retinal status in those with poor-quality images. Appropriate assessment of control of their diabetes is also important in those who are screen positive. Audit and internal and external quality assurance schemes are embedded in the service. In England, two-field mydriatic digital photographic screening is offered annually to all people with diabetes aged 12 years and over. The programme commenced in 2003 and reached population coverage across the whole of England by 2008. Increasing uptake has been achieved and the current annual uptake of the programme in 2015-16 is 82.8% when 2.59 million people with diabetes were offered screening and 2.14 million were screened. The benefit of the programme is that, in England, diabetic retinopathy/maculopathy is no longer the leading cause of certifiable blindness in the working age group.",

Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic.Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions. Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise.Due to prolonged viral shedding, quarantine in obese subjects should likely be longer than normal weight individuals.",

This strategy is not efficient and new paradigms should be found. The wide analysis of the genome cannot predict or explain more than 10-20% of the disease, whereas changes in feeding and social behavior have certainly a major impact. However, the molecular mechanisms linking environmental factors and genetic susceptibility were so far not envisioned until the recent discovery of a hidden source of genomic diversity, i.e., the metagenome. More than 3 million genes from several hundreds of species constitute our intestinal microbiome. First key experiments have demonstrated that this biome can by itself transfer metabolic disease. The mechanisms are unknown but could be involved in the modulation of energy harvesting capacity by the host as well as the low-grade inflammation and the corresponding immune response on adipose tissue plasticity, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and even the secondary cardiovascular events. Secreted bacterial factors reach the circulating blood, and even full bacteria from intestinal microbiota can reach tissues where inflammation is triggered. The last 5 years have demonstrated that intestinal microbiota, at its molecular level, is a causal factor early in the development of the diseases. Nonetheless, much more need to be uncovered in order to identify first, new predictive biomarkers so that preventive strategies based on pre- and probiotics, and second, new therapeutic strategies against the cause rather than the consequence of hyperglycemia and body weight gain.",

CircRNAs in the peripheral blood from six healthy individuals and six T2DM patients were collected for microarray analysis, and an independent cohort study consisting of 20 normal cases, 20 pre-diabetes patients and 20 T2DM patients was conducted to verify the five chosen circRNAs. We then tested hsa_circ_0054633 in a third cohort (control group, n = 60; pre-diabetes group, n = 63; and T2DM group, n = 64) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). In total, 489 circRNAs were discovered to be differentially expressed between the two groups, and of these, 78 were upregulated and 411 were downregulated in the T2DM group. Five circRNAs were then selected as candidate biomarkers and further verified in a second cohort. Hsa_circ_0054633 was found to have the largest area under the curve (AUC). The diagnostic capacity of hsa_circ_0054633 was tested in a third cohort. After introducing the risk factors of T2DM, the hsa_circ_0054633 AUCs for the diagnosis of pre-diabetes and T2DM slightly increased from 0.751 (95% confidence interval [0.666–0.835], P < 0.001) to 0.841 ([0.773–0.910], P < 0.001) and from 0.793 ([0.716–0.871], P < 0.001) to 0.834 ([0.762–0.905], P < 0.001), respectively.

We are herein discussing a possible novel therapeutic tool for COVID-19.Virus binds to the cell surface receptor ACE2; indeed, recent evidences suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be using as co-receptor, when entering the cells, the same one used by MERS-Co-V, namely the DPP4/CD26 receptor. The aforementioned observation underlined that mechanism of cell entry is supposedly similar among different coronavirus, that the co-expression of ACE2 and DPP4/CD26 could identify those cells targeted by different human coronaviruses and that clinical complications may be similar.The DPP4 family/system was implicated in various physiological processes and diseases of the immune system, and DPP4/CD26 is variously expressed on epithelia and endothelia of the systemic vasculature, lung, kidney, small intestine and heart. In particular, DPP4 distribution in the human respiratory tract may facilitate the entrance of the virus into the airway tract itself and could contribute to the development of cytokine storm and immunopathology in causing fatal COVID-19 pneumonia.The use of DPP4 inhibitors, such as gliptins, in patients with COVID-19 with, or even without, type 2 diabetes, may offer a simple way to reduce the virus entry and replication into the airways and to hamper the sustained cytokine storm and inflammation within the lung in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.",

Methods Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity are metabolic disorders whose prevalence has significantly increased in recent decades and is expected to increase every year, to pandemic proportions. These two pathologies often coexist and have substantial public health implications. The term “diabesity” defines the pathophysiological connection between overweight and T2DM. The gut microbiota affects many aspects of the host. Beyond the regulation of intestinal functions and the activation of immune responses, the gut microbiota plays a role in central nervous system functions (i.e., mood, and psychiatric conditions associated with stress and memory) and is a central regulator of metabolism and appetite. Results The MGBA involves pathways such as the autonomic and enteric nervous systems, the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal axis, the immune system, enteroendocrine cells, and microbial metabolites. Notably, the vagus nerve plays an essential role in eating behavior by modulating appetite and learning nutritional preferences. Conclusions Because of its enteroendocrine cell-mediated interaction with the gut microbiota, the vagus nerve may provide a potential pathway through which gut microorganisms influence host feeding behavior and metabolic control of physiological and pathological conditions.",

AID significantly increased TIR (Mean difference, MD 7.01%, 95% CI 3.72–10.30) and reduced time in hyperglycaemia &gt; 140 mg/dL and &gt; 180 mg/dL (MD – 5.09%, 95% CI – 9.41 to – 0.78 and MD – 2.44%, 95% CI – 4.69 to – 0.20, respectively). Additionally, glycaemic variability was significantly reduced (MD – 1.66%, 95% CI – 2.73 to – 0.58). Other outcomes did not differ significantly. Conclusion AID systems effectively improve glycaemic control during pregnancy in women with T1DM by increasing TIR and reducing hyperglycaemia without any observed adverse short-term effects on maternal and fetal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a significant public health burden on the basis of its increased incidence, morbidity, and mortality. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of inadequate glycaemic control and its correlates in a large multicentre survey of Brazilian patients with diabetes. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a consecutive sample of patients aged 18 years or older with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, attending health centres located in ten large cities in Brazil (response rate = 84%). Information about diabetes, current medications, complications, diet, and satisfaction with treatment were obtained by trained interviewers, using a standardized questionnaire. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in a central laboratory. Patients with HbA(1c) > or = 7 were considered to have inadequate glycaemic control. Overall 6,701 patients were surveyed, 979 (15%) with type 1 and 5,692 (85%) with type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of inadequate glycaemic control was 76%. Poor glycaemic control was more common in patients with type 1 diabetes (90%) than in those with type 2 (73%), P < 0.001. Characteristics significantly associated with improved glycaemic control included: fewer years of diabetes duration, multi professional care, participation in a diabetes health education program, and satisfaction with current diabetes treatment. Despite increased awareness of the benefits of tight glycaemic control, we found that few diabetic patients in Brazil met recommended glycaemic control targets. This may contribute to increased rates of diabetic complications, which may impact health care costs. Our data support the public health message of implementation of early, aggressive management of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Until early 2000, permanent and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), defined as diabetes with onset within 6 weeks from birth that requires insulin therapy for at least 2 weeks, were considered exceedingly rare conditions, with a global incidence of 1:500,000–1:400,000 live births. The new definition of NDM recently adopted, that includes patients with diabetes onset within 6 months of age, has prompted studies that have set the incidence of the permanent form alone between 1:210,000 and 1:260,000 live births. Aim of the present work was to ascertain the incidence of NDM (i.e. permanent + transient form) in Italy for years 2005–2010. Patients referred to the Italian reference laboratory for NDM between years 2005 and 2010 and screened for mutations in common NDM genes (KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS) and for uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 (UDP6) were reviewed. A questionnaire aimed at identifying NDM cases investigated in other laboratories was sent to 54 Italian reference centers for pediatric diabetes. Twenty-seven patients with NDM born between 2005 and 2010 were referred to the reference laboratory. In this group, a mutation of either KCNJ11, ABCC8 or INS was found in 18 patients, and a case with UDP6 was identified. Questionnaires revealed 4 additional cases with transient neonatal diabetes due to UDP6. Incidence of NDM was calculated at 1:90,000 (CI: 1:63,000–1:132,000) live births. Thus, with the definition currently in use, about 6 new cases with NDM are expected to be born in Italy each year.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the impact of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), treatment satisfaction (TS) medical resource use, and indirect costs in the SWITCH study. SWITCH was a multicentre, randomized, crossover study. Patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 153) using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) were randomized to a 12 month sensor-On/Off or sensor-Off/On sequence (6 months each treatment), with a 4-month washout between periods. HRQOL in children and TS in adults were measured using validated questionnaires. Medical resource utilization data were collected. In adults, TS was significantly higher in the sensor-On arm, and there were significant improvements in ratings for treatment convenience and flexibility. There were no clinically significant differences in children's HRQOL or parents' proxy ratings. The incidence of severe hypoglycaemia, unscheduled visits, or diabetes-related hospitalizations did not differ significantly between the two arms. Adult patients made fewer telephone consultations during the sensor-On arm; children's caregivers made similar numbers of telephone consultations during both arms, and calls were on average only 3 min longer during the sensor-On arm. Regarding indirect costs, children with >70 % sensor usage missed fewer school days, compared with the sensor-Off arm (P = 0.0046) but there was no significant difference in the adults days of work off. The addition of CGM to CSII resulted in better metabolic control without imposing an additional burden on the patient or increased medical resource use, and offered the potential for cost offsets.",

    "abstract": "The human gut is a home for more than 100 trillion bacteria, far more than all other microbial populations resident on the body's surface. The human gut microbiome is considered as a microbial organ symbiotically operating within the host. It is a collection of different cell lineages that are capable of communicating with each other and the host and has an ability to undergo self-replication for its repair and maintenance. As the gut microbiota is involved in many host processes including growth and development, an imbalance in its ecological composition may lead to disease and dysfunction in the human. Gut microbial degradation of nutrients produces bioactive metabolites that bind target receptors, activating signalling cascades, and modulating host metabolism. This review covers current findings on the nutritional and pharmacological roles of selective gut microbial metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, methylamines and indoles, as well as discussing nutritional interventions to modulate the microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gut microbiota and its metabolites have been shown to influence multiple physiological mechanisms related to human health. Among microbial metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are modulators of different metabolic pathways. On the other hand, several studies suggested that diet might influence gut microbiota composition and activity thus modulating the risk of metabolic disease, i.e. obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Among dietary component, dietary fibre may play a pivotal role by virtue of its prebiotic effect on fibre-fermenting bacteria, that may increase SCFA production. The aim of this review was to summarize and discuss current knowledge on the impact of dietary fibre as modulator of the relationship between glucose metabolism and microbiota composition in humans. More specifically, we analysed evidence from observational studies and randomized nutritional intervention investigating the relationship between gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids and glucose metabolism. The possible mechanisms behind this association were also discussed.",

    "abstract": "A variety of basal insulin preparations are used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to summarize scientific evidence on relative efficacy and safety of insulin glargine (IGlar) and other insulins in T2DM. A systematic review was carried out in major medical databases up to December 2012. Relevant studies compared efficacy and safety of IGlar, added to oral drugs (OAD) or/and in combination with bolus insulin, with protamine insulin (NPH) or premixed insulin (MIX) in the same regimen, as well as with insulin detemir (IDet), in T2DM. Target HbA1c level without hypoglycemic events was considered the primary endpoint. Twenty eight RCTs involving 12,669 T2DM patients followed for 12–52 weeks were included in quantitative analysis. IGlar + OAD use was associated with higher probability of reaching target HbA1c level without hypoglycemia as compared to NPH + OAD (RR = 1.32 [1.09, 1.59]) or MIX without OAD (RR = 1.61 [1.22, 2.13]) and similar effect as IDet + OAD (RR = 1.07 [0.87, 1.33]) and MIX + OAD (RR = 1.09 [0.86, 1.38]). IGlar + OAD demonstrated significantly lower risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia as compared to NPH + OAD (RR = 0.89 [0.83, 0.96]), MIX + OAD (RR = 0.75 [0.68, 0.83]) and MIX without OAD(RR = 0.75 [0.68, 0.83]), but not with IDet + OAD (RR = 0.99 [0.90, 1.08]). In basal-bolus regimens, IGlar demonstrated similar proportion of T2DM patients achieving target HbA1c as compared to NPH (RR = 1.14 [0.91, 1.44]) but higher than MIX (RR = 1.26 [1.12, 1.42) or IDet (RR = 1.38 [1.11, 1.72]). The risk of severe hypoglycemia was lower in IGlar than in NPH (RR = 0.77 [0.63, 0.94]), with no differences in comparison with MIX (RR = 0.74 [0.46, 1.20]) and IDet (RR = 1.10 [0.54, 2.25]). IGlar + OAD has comparable safety profile to NPH, with less frequent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation than MIX + OAD (RR = 0.41 [0.22, 0.76]) and IDet + OAD (RR = 0.40 [0.24, 0.69]). Also severe adverse reactions were less common for IGlar + OAD when compared to MIX + OAD (RR = 0.71 [0.52; 0.98]). For the majority of examined efficacy and safety outcomes, IGlar use in T2DM patients was superior or non-inferior to the alternative insulin treatment options.",

    "abstract": "The COronaVirus DISease 19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older age and presence of comorbidities, including diabetes, were shown to be associated with a more severe course and a higher fatality rate. Studies from the most affected countries, including China, United States and Italy, seem to indicate that prevalence of diabetes among patients affected by COVID-19 is not higher than that observed in the general population, thus suggesting that diabetes is not a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, a large body of evidence demonstrate that diabetes is a risk factor for disease progression towards critical illness, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation or admission to intensive care unit, and ultimately death. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes remain to be elucidated. In particular, it is still unresolved whether is diabetes per se, especially if poorly controlled, or rather the various comorbidities/complications associated with it that predispose patients with COVID-19 to a worse prognosis. In fact, conditions that cluster with diabetes in the context of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity and hypertension, or complicate chronic hyperglycemia, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, have also been associated with poor prognosis in these individuals and the available studies have not consistently shown that diabetes predict disease severity independently of them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diabetes and sepsis are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and diabetic patients represent the largest population experiencing post-sepsis complications and rising mortality. Dysregulated immune pathways commonly found in both sepsis and diabetes contribute to worsen the host response in diabetic patients with sepsis. The impact of diabetes on mortality from sepsis is still controversial. Whereas a substantial proportion of severe infections can be attributed to poor glycemic control, treatment with insulin, metformin and thiazolidinediones may be associated with lower incidence and mortality for sepsis. It has been suggested that chronic exposure to high glucose might enhance immune adaptation, leading to reduced mortality rate in septic diabetic patients. On the other hand, higher risk of acute kidney injury has been extensively documented and a suggested lower risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome has been recently questioned. Additional investigations are ongoing to confirm the protective role of some anti-diabetic treatments, the occurrence of acute organ dysfunction, and the risk/benefit of less stringent glycemic control in diabetic patients experiencing sepsis. Based on a MEDLINE/PubMed search from inception to December 31, 2020, the aim of this review is therefore to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of current knowledge on the interplay between diabetes and sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims The aim of the present study was to evaluate, by means of a meta-analysis approach, whether new available data, appeared on qualified literature, can support the effectiveness of an association of HbA1c variability with the risk of macro- and/or micro-vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods The meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA Statement guidelines and considered published studies on T2DM, presenting HbA1c variability as standard deviation (SD) or its derived coefficient of variation (CV). Literature search was performed on PubMed in the time range 2015–July 2022, with no restrictions of language. Results Twenty-three selected studies fulfilled the aims of the present investigation. Overall, the analysis of the risk as hazard ratios (HR) indicated a significant association between the HbA1c variability, expressed either as SD or CV, and the complications, except for neuropathy. Macro-vascular complications were all significantly associated with HbA1c variability, with HR 1.40 (95%CI 1.31–1.50, p &lt; 0.0001) for stroke, 1.30 (95%CI 1.25–1.36, p &lt; 0.0001) for transient ischaemic attack/coronary heart disease/myocardial infarction, and 1.32 (95%CI 1.13–1.56, p = 0.0007) for peripheral arterial disease. Micro-vascular complications yielded HR 1.29 (95%CI 1.22–1.36, p &lt; 0.0001) for nephropathy, 1.03 (95%CI 0.99–1.08, p = 0.14) for neuropathy, and 1.15 (95%CI 1.08–1.24, p &lt; 0.0001) for retinopathy. For all-cause mortality, HR was 1.33 (95%CI 1.27–1.39, p &lt; 0.0001), and for cardiovascular mortality 1.25 (95%CI 1.17–1.34, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions Our meta-analysis on HbA1c variability performed on the most recent published data since 2015 indicates positive association between HbA1c variability and macro-/micro-vascular complications, as well as mortality events, in T2DM, suggesting that this long-term glycaemic parameter merits further attention as a predictive, independent risk factor for T2DM population.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies demonstrated an association between hospital admission blood glucose and mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Because stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) has been suggested as a more reliable marker of stress hyperglycemia this study investigated to what extent SHR in comparison with admission blood glucose is associated with short- and long-term mortality in diabetic and non-diabetic AMI patients.The analysis was based on 2,311 AMI patients aged 25-84 years from the population-based Myocardial Infarction Registry Augsburg (median follow-up time 6.5 years [IQR: 4.9-8.1]). The SHR was calculated as admission glucose (mg/dl)/(28.7 × HbA1c (%)-46.7). Using logistic and COX regression analyses the associations between SHR and admission glucose and mortality were investigated.Higher admission glucose and higher SHR were significantly and nonlinearly associated with higher 28-day mortality in AMI patients with and without diabetes. In patients without diabetes, the AUC for SHR was significantly lower than for admission glucose (SHR: 0.6912 [95%CI 0.6317-0.7496], admission glucose: 0.716 [95%CI 0.6572-0.7736], p-value: 0.0351). In patients with diabetes the AUCs were similar for SHR and admission glucose. Increasing admission glucose and SHR were significantly nonlinearly associated with higher 5-year all-cause mortality in AMI patients with diabetes but not in non-diabetic patients. AUC values indicated a comparable prediction of 5-year mortality for both measures in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.Stress hyperglycemia in AMI patients plays a significant role mainly with regard to short-term prognosis, but barely so for long-term prognosis, underlining the assumption that it is a transient dynamic disorder that occurs to varying degrees during the acute event, thereby affecting prognosis.",

Current clinical guidelines acknowledge the therapeutic strength of exercise intervention. This paper reviews the wide pathophysiological problems associated with Type 2 diabetes and discusses the benefits of exercise therapy on phenotype characteristics, glycemic control and cardiovascular risk profile in Type 2 diabetes patients. Based on the currently available literature, it is concluded that Type 2 diabetes patients should be stimulated to participate in specifically designed exercise intervention programs. More attention should be paid to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning as well as motivational factors to improve long-term treatment adherence and clinical efficacy. More clinical research is warranted to establish the efficacy of exercise intervention in a more differentiated approach for Type 2 diabetes subpopulations within different stages of the disease and various levels of co-morbidity.",

    "abstract": "The Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group of India (DIPSI) guidelines recommend the non-fasting 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as a single-step screening and diagnostic test for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The aim of this study was to compare the DIPSI criteria with the World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 and the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria for GDM. A total of 1,031 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in urban and rural Tamil Nadu, India, underwent a 75-g OGTT in both non-fasting and fasting states, 2-3 days apart. Venous plasma glucose was measured using an autoanalyser, and GDM was diagnosed by DIPSI, WHO 1999 and IADPSG criteria. Of the 83 women identified to have GDM by WHO 1999 criteria, only 23 were diagnosed by DIPSI criteria. Of the 106 women diagnosed to have GDM by the IADPSG criteria, only 24 were diagnosed by DIPSI. The DIPSI non-fasting OGTT 2-h VPG cut point of 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) had a very low sensitivity when compared to the WHO 1999 criteria (sensitivity 27.7 %, specificity 97.7 %) and IADPSG criteria (sensitivity 22.6 %, specificity 97.8 %). The DIPSI non-fasting OGTT criteria cannot be recommended for diagnosis of GDM due to its low sensitivity. Thus, as a single-step diagnostic test for GDM, the fasting OGTT needs to be done. When this is not possible, the well-established two-step procedure using the 50-g glucose challenge test as an initial screening test, followed by the diagnostic fasting OGTT, can be continued.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is associated with a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which cannot be explained only by known risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, and atherogenic dyslipidemia, so other factors, such as advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and oxidative stress, may be involved. In this frame, hyperglycemia and an increased oxidative stress (AGE formation, increased polyol and hexosamine pathway flux, and protein kinase C activation) lead to tissue damage, thus contributing to the onset of cardiovascular complications. Several studies have identified in various cell systems, such as monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells, specific cellular receptors (RAGE) that bind AGE proteins. The binding of AGEs on RAGE induces the production of cytokines and intracellular oxidative stress, thus leading to vascular damage. Soluble RAGE levels have been identified as hypothetical markers of CVD, but, in this regard, there are sparse and conflicting data in the literature. The purpose of this review was to examine all the available information on this issue with a view to clarifying or at least highlighting the points that are still weak, especially from the point of clinical view.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have identified neuroretinal abnormalities in persons affected by diabetes mellitus, before the onset of microvascular alterations. However, the role of glycemic variability (GV) on early retinal neurodegeneration is still not clarified. To explore the relationship between glycemic control and neuroretinal characteristics, 37 persons with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (Type 1 DM) divided into two groups with no signs (noRD) and with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) compared to 13 healthy control participants (C) were recruited. All persons underwent an optical coherence tomography with automatic segmentation of all neuroretinal layers. Measurements of mean of nasal (N)/temporal (T)/superior (S)/inferior (I) macular quadrants for individual layer were also calculated. Metabolic control was evaluated by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and indexes of GV were calculated from continuous glucose monitoring. The difference among the three groups in terms of RNFL thickness was significantly dependent on quadrant (F(6;132) = 2.315; p = 0.037). This interaction was due to a specific difference in RNFL-N thickness, where both Type 1 DM groups showed a similar reduction versus C (−3.9 for noDR and −4.9 for NPDR), without any relevant difference between them (−1.0). Inner nuclear layer (INL) was increased in all quadrants in the two Type 1 DM groups compared to C (mean difference = 7.73; 95% CI: 0.32–15.14, p = 0.043; mean difference = 7.74; 95% CI: 0.33–15.15, p = 0.043, respectively). A negative correlation between RNFL-N and low blood glucose index (r = −0.382, p = 0.034) and positive correlation between INL and continuous overall net glycemic action −1, −2, −4 h (r = 0.40, p = 0.025; r = 0.39, p = 0.031; r = 0.41, p = 0.021, respectively) were observed in Type 1 DM patients. The triglycerides were positively and significantly correlated to INL (r = 0.48, p = 0.011), in Type 1 DM subjects. GV and triglycerides resulted both independent predictors of increased INL thickness. No correlation was found with HbA1c. Early structural damage of neuroretina in persons with Type 1 DM patients is related to glucose fluctuations. GV should be addressed, even in the presence of a good metabolic control.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic patients have multiple risk factors for colonisation with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a nosocomial pathogen associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the prevalence of MRSA among diabetic patients. The MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published up to May 2018 that reported primary data on the prevalence of MRSA in 10 or more diabetic patients. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted the data. The main outcomes were the pooled prevalence rates of MRSA colonisation and infection among diabetic populations. Eligible data sets were divided into three groups containing data about the prevalence of MRSA colonisation or in diabetic foot or other infections. From 23 data sets, the prevalence of MRSA colonisation among 11577 diabetics was 9.20% (95% CI, 6.26–12.63%). Comparison of data from 14 studies that examined diabetic and non-diabetic patients found that diabetics had a 4.75% greater colonisation rate (P < 0.0001). From 41 data sets, the prevalence of MRSA in 10994 diabetic foot infection patients was 16.78% (95% CI, 13.21–20.68%). Among 2147 non-foot skin and soft-tissue infections, the MRSA prevalence rate was 18.03% (95% CI, 6.64–33.41). The prevalence of MRSA colonisation among diabetic patients is often higher than among non-diabetics; this may make targeted screening attractive. In the UK, many diabetic patients may already be covered by the current screening policies. The prevalence and impact of MRSA among diabetic healthcare workers requires further research. The high prevalence of MRSA among diabetic foot infections may have implications for antimicrobial resistance, and should encourage strategies aimed at infection prevention or alternative therapies.",

    "abstract": "No study explores the association between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and glucose metabolism in general women. We aim to investigate whether the variation of FSH is associated with prediabetes and diabetes in postmenopausal women. Our data were from survey on prevalence in East China for metabolic diseases and risk factors in 2014. Thousand six hundred and ten postmenopausal women at the age of 55–89 who were not using hormone replacement therapy were selected. Prediabetes and diabetes were defined according to American Diabetes Association 2014 criteria. FSH, luteinizing hormone, total testosterone and estradiol were measured by chemiluminescence. Multinomial logistic analyses were used for the association of FSH with prediabetes and diabetes, and linear regression for the association of FSH with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c. Among the participants, 778 (48.3 %) had prediabetes and 121 (7.5 %) had newly diagnosed diabetes. In linear regression, after full adjustment for demographic variables, metabolic factors, E2 and LH, FSH was associated with FPG and HbA1c (P < 0.05). In logistic regression, increased quartiles of FSH were associated with significantly decreased odds ratios of prediabetes and diabetes (P for trend <0.01). This association was attenuated by waist circumference and HOMA-IR, but persisted in fully adjusted model (P for trend <0.05) in which, for the lowest compared with the highest quartile of FSH, the odds ratios of prediabetes and diabetes were 1.93 (95 % CI 1.21–3.08; P < 0.01) and 3.02 (95 % CI 1.10–8.31; P < 0.05), respectively. Low FSH was associated with prediabetes and diabetes in postmenopausal women. The associations might be partially explained by adiposity and insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1) down-regulation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been associated with epigenetic markers of oxidative stress. We herein aim to evaluate whether an increase in SIRT-1 expression affects histone 3 acetylation at the 56 lysine residue (H3K56ac) in T2DM patients randomly selected to receive either resveratrol (40 mg or 500 mg) or a placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome is changes in the H3K56ac level by variation in SIRT-1 expression and the secondary outcome is the evidence of association between SIRT-1 level, antioxidant markers (TAS), and metabolic variables. Methods and results At baseline, peripheral blood mononuclear cell H3K56ac values among the SIRT-1 tertiles did not differ. At trial end, SIRT-1 levels were significantly higher in patients receiving 500 mg resveratrol. At follow-up, patients were divided into tertiles of delta (trial end minus baseline) SIRT-1 value. Significant reductions in H3K56ac and body fat percentage were found in the highest tertile as were increased TAS levels. A multiple logistic regression model showed that the highest delta SIRT-1 tertile was inversely associated with variations in H3K56ac (OR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.44–0.99), TAS (OR = 1.01; 95% CI 1.00–1.02), and body fat percentage (OR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.58–0.96). Conclusions We provide new knowledge on H3K56ac and SIRT-1 association in T2DM. These data suggest that boosting SIRT-1 expression/activation may impact redox homeostasis in these patients.

    "abstract": "Billions of people have been under lockdown in an attempt to prevent COVID-19 spread. Lifestyle changes during lockdown could lead to deterioration of glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the glycemic control of pediatric patients with T1D.This observational real-life study from the AWeSoMe Group assessed continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics of 102 T1D patients (52.9% males, mean age 11.2 ± 3.8 years, mean diabetes duration 4.2 ± 3.8 years) who used Dexcom G5. The data were accessed without any interface between patients, caregivers, and the diabetes team. Study variables from CGM metrics were: mean glucose level, time-in-range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dL; 3.9-10 mmol/L), hypoglycemia (< 54 mg/dL; < 3 mmol/L), hyperglycemia (> 250 mg/dL; > 13.3 mmol/L), coefficient of variation (CV), and time CGM active before and during lockdown. Delta-variable = lockdown variable minus before-lockdown variable.The mean TIR was 60.9 ± 14.3% before lockdown, with no significant change during lockdown (delta-TIR was 0.9 ± 7.9%). TIR during lockdown was significantly correlated with TIR before lockdown (r = 0.855, P < 0.001). Patients with improved TIR (delta-TIR > 3%) were significantly older than patients with stable or worse TIR (P = 0.028). Children aged < 10 years had a significantly higher CV before lockdown and during lockdown than children aged ≥ 10 years (P = 0.02 and P = 0.005, respectively). Among children aged < 10 years, a multiple linear regression model revealed associations of age and lower socioeconomic cluster with delta-TIR (F = 4.416, P = 0.019) and with delta-mean glucose (F = 4.459, P = 0.018).CGM metrics in pediatric patients with T1D were relatively stable during a nationwide lockdown. Intervention plans should focus on younger patients with lower socioeconomic position.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is known to be associated with high BMI and waist circumference (WC). These measures do not discriminate well between skeletal muscle (SM) and body fat (BF), which may have opposite influences. We conducted a secondary analysis of population-based data from 58,128 aged 18–85 yrs from Scottish Health Surveys (2003, 2008–2011) and Health Surveys for England (2003–2006, 2008–2013), excluding pregnant women and insulin-treated diabetes. Logistic regression was used to assess associations of known T2D, and of screened HbA1c > 48 mmol/mol (> 6.5%), with sex-specific quintiles of BMI, WC, and BF% and SM% estimated by validated anthropometric equations, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, ethnicity, country, and survey year. As expected, ORs for having known T2D rose with quintiles of BMI (1, 1.5, 2.3, 3.1, and 6.5) and WC (1, 1.8, 2.5, 3.5, and 8.7). Compared to the lowest BF% quintile, OR for having T2D in highest BF% quintile was 11.1 (95% CI = 8.4–14.6). Compared to the highest SM% quintile, OR for having T2D in lowest SM% quintile was 2.0 (1.7–2.4). Of 72 adults with T2D/HbA1c > 6.5% in the lowest quintile of BF%, 27 (37.5%) were in quintile 1 of SM%. Similar patterns of OR were observed for having HbA1c > 6.5% in those without known T2D. Estimated BF% associates strongly with T2D. Low SM% also has a significant association, suggesting a neglected aspect of aetiology within T2D. These two simple measures with biological relevance, available from data collected in most health surveys, may be more useful than the purely statistical terms BMI.",

Early detection and treatment are necessary to forestall vision loss from DR. Methods A working group of ophthalmic and diabetes experts was established to develop a consensus on the key principles of an effective DR screening program. Recommendations are based on analysis of a structured literature review. Results The recommendations for implementing an effective DR screening program are: (1) Examination methods must be suitable for the screening region, and DR classification/grading systems must be systematic and uniformly applied. Two-field retinal imaging is sufficient for DR screening and is preferable to seven-field imaging, and referable DR should be well defined and reliably identifiable by qualified screening staff; (2) in many countries/regions, screening can and should take place outside the ophthalmology clinic; (3) screening staff should be accredited and show evidence of ongoing training; (4) screening programs should adhere to relevant national quality assurance standards; (5) studies that use uniform definitions of risk to determine optimum risk-based screening intervals are required; (6) technology infrastructure should be in place to ensure that high-quality images can be stored securely to protect patient information; (7) although screening for diabetic macular edema (DME) in conjunction with DR evaluations may have merit, there is currently insufficient evidence to support implementation of programs solely for DME screening. Conclusion Use of these recommendations may yield more effective DR screening programs that reduce the risk of vision loss worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims The global epidemic of diabetes mellitus continues to expand, including its large impact on national health care. Measuring diabetes outcomes and their causes of variation highlights areas for improvement in care and efficiency gains; large registries carry this potential. By means of a systematic review, we aimed to give an overview of national registries worldwide by quantifying their data and assessing their influence on diabetes care. Methods The literature on MEDLINE up to March 31, 2020, was searched, using keywords diabetes mellitus, national, registry, registration, and/or database. National disease-specific registries from corresponding articles were included. Database characteristics and clinical variables were obtained. All registries were compared to the ICHOM standard set of outcomes. Results We identified 12 national clinical diabetes registries, comprising a total of 7,181,356 diabetic patients worldwide. Nearly all registries recorded weight, HbA1c, lipid profile, and insulin treatment; the recording of other variables varied to a great extent. Overall, registries corresponded fairly well with the ICHOM set. Most registries proved to monitor and improve the quality of diabetes care using guidelines as a benchmark. The effects on national healthcare policy were more variable and often less clear. Conclusions National diabetes registries confer clear insights into diagnostics, complications, and treatment. The extent to which registries influenced national healthcare policy was less clear. A globally implemented standard outcome set has the potential to improve concordance between national registries, enhance the comparison and exchange of diabetes outcomes, and allocate resources and interventions where most needed.",

    "abstract": "The first preparation of insulin extracted from a pancreas and made suitable for use in humans after purification was achieved 100 years ago in Toronto, an epoch-making achievement, which has ultimately provided a life-giving treatment for millions of people worldwide. The earliest animal-derived formulations were short-acting and contained many impurities that caused adverse reactions, thereby limiting their therapeutic potential. However, since then, insulin production and purification improved with enhanced technologies, along with a full understanding of the insulin molecule structure. The availability of radio-immunoassays contributed to the unravelling of the physiology of glucose homeostasis, ultimately leading to the adoption of rational models of insulin replacement. The introduction of recombinant DNA technologies has since resulted in the era of both rapid- and long-acting human insulin analogues administered via the subcutaneous route which better mimic the physiology of insulin secretion, leading to the modern basal-bolus regimen. These advances, in combination with improved education and technologies for glucose monitoring, enable people with diabetes to better meet individual glycaemic goals with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. While the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise globally, it is important to recognise the scientific endeavour that has led to insulin remaining the cornerstone of diabetes management, on the centenary of its first successful use in humans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hyperglycemia strongly affects endothelial function and activation, which in turn increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Among pharmacotherapies aimed at lowering blood glucose levels, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) represent a class of drugs involved in the improvement of the endothelium damage and the progression of cardiovascular diseases. They show antihypertensive and antiatherosclerotic actions due at least in part to direct favorable actions on the coronary vascular endothelium, such as oxidative stress reduction and nitric oxide increase. However, cumulative peripheral indirect actions could also contribute to the antiatherosclerotic functions of GLP-1/GLP-1R agonists, including metabolism and gut microbiome regulation. Therefore, further research is necessary to clarify the specific role of this drug class in the management of cardiovascular disease and to identify specific cellular targets involved in the protective signal transduction. In the present review, we provide an overview of the effects of GLP-1RAs treatment on cardiovascular disease with particular attention on potential molecular mechanisms involving endothelium function on formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaque.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims To expand the evidence base for the clinical use of metformin, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy and safety of metformin versus insulin with respect to short-term neonatal outcomes. Methods A comprehensive search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) was performed. Two reviewers extracted the data and calculated pooled estimates by use of a random-effects model. In total, 24 studies involving 4355 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the quantitative analyses. Results Unlike insulin, metformin lowered neonatal birth weights (mean difference − 122.76 g; 95% confidence interval [CI] − 178.31, − 67.21; p &lt; 0.0001), the risk of macrosomia (risk ratio [RR] 0.68; 95% CI 0.54, 0.86; p = 0.001), the incidence of neonatal intensive care unit admission (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.61, 0.88; p = 0.0009), and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.52, 0.81; p = 0.0001). Subgroup analysis based on the maximum daily oral dose of metformin indicated that metformin-induced neonatal birth weight loss was independent of the oral dose. Conclusions Our meta-analysis provides further evidence that metformin is a safe oral antihyperglycemic drug and has some benefits over insulin when used for the treatment of gestational diabetes, without an increased risk of short-term neonatal adverse outcomes. Metformin may be particularly useful in women with gestational diabetes at high risk for neonatal hypoglycemia, women who want to limit maternal and fetal weight gain, and women with an inability to afford or use insulin safely.",

Estimating the incidence rate of childhood type 1 diabetes will allow to aid in adequate planning of health care resources. The study’s aim was to assess the incidence rate of type 1 diabetes in children below 15 years of age from Greater Poland (Poland) between 2006 and 2018, and then to compare obtained data to records collected between 1998 and 2003 in pediatric population aged 0–14 years from the same area. Methods In this cohort study covering the period from January 1998 to December 2018, data were collected for children and adolescents below 14 years of age with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes living in Greater Poland. The overall population size was taken from the Statistical Office of Poland. Total, sex-, and age-specific incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated for each calendar year. Results Over a 20-year period, the incidence rate of type 1 diabetes in children aged 0–14 years rose around 3.6-fold, from 8.4/100,000 in 1998 to 30.8/100,000 in 2018, with the peak incidence recorded in last year of the study. A clear male predominance of type 1 diabetes was seen in all ages. The rate of type 1 diabetes incidence growth was comparable between all age groups, while the highest incidence rate was mostly observed in children aged 5–9 and 10–14 years. Conclusions The incidence of type 1 diabetes in children aged 0–14 years is rapidly increasing in Greater Poland.",

This review critically evaluates preclinical and clinical evidence on FMT in type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Studies suggest that FMT can restore microbial diversity, improve glycemic control, and modulate immune responses, with varying effects across diabetes subtypes. In T1D, preclinical models demonstrate that FMT influences regulatory T-cell expansion and β-cell preservation, though clinical translation remains limited. In T2D, FMT has shown transient improvements in insulin sensitivity, with sustained effects observed only in patients with specific microbiome signatures. However, heterogeneity in patient responses, donor variability, and methodological limitations complicate its clinical application. This review highlights the interplay between FMT, immune modulation, and microbial metabolism, advocating for phenotype-stratified trials and multi-omics integration to enhance therapeutic precision.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate usefulness of capillary blood glucose (CBG) for diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in resource-constrained settings where venous plasma glucose (VPG) estimations may be impossible. Consecutive pregnant women (n = 1031) attending antenatal clinics in southern India underwent 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Fasting, 1- and 2-h VPG (AU2700 Beckman, Fullerton, CA) and CBG (One Touch Ultra-II, LifeScan) were simultaneously measured. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated for different CBG cut points using the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria for the diagnosis of GDM as gold standard. Bland–Altman plots were drawn to look at the agreement between CBG and VPG. Correlation and regression equation analysis were also derived for CBG values. Pearson's correlation between VPG and CBG for fasting was r = 0.433 [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.596, p < 0.001], for 1H, it was r = 0.653 (ICC = 0.776, p < 0.001), and for 2H, r = 0.784 (ICC = 0.834, p < 0.001). Comparing a single CBG 2-h cut point of 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) with the IADPSG criteria, the sensitivity and specificity were 62.3 and 80.7 %, respectively. If CBG cut points of 120 mg/dl (6.6 mmol/l) or 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) were used, the sensitivity improves to 78.3 and 92.5 %, respectively. In settings where VPG estimations are not possible, CBG can be used as an initial screening test for GDM, using lower 2H CBG cut points to maximize the sensitivity. Those who screen positive can be referred to higher centers for definitive testing, using VPG.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of myocardial dysfunction (MD) and heart failure (HF) in long-lasting (≥10 years) type 1 diabetes without cardiovascular disorders or with hypertension or coronary heart disease (CHD). The study included 1,685 patients with type 1 diabetes (mean baseline age, 51 years; diabetes duration, 36 years). In all patients, echocardiography was performed, NT-proBNP levels were measured, and clinical symptoms were evaluated. A 7-year follow-up was conducted to monitor systolic and diastolic manifestations of MD and HF. At the end of the follow-up period, the prevalence of HF in the entire group was 3.7 %, and the incidence was 0.02 % per year. The prevalence of MD was 14.5 % and the incidence -0.1 % per year. MD and HF were observed only in hypertensive or CHD patients. At baseline, subjects with diastolic HF constituted 85 % of the HF population and those with systolic HF the remaining 15 %. Baseline HF predictors included age, diabetes duration, HbA1c levels, CHD, systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg, and GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). In patients with type 1 diabetes, MD and HF occurred only when diabetes coexisted with cardiovascular disorders affecting myocardial function. The prevalence and incidence of HF in patients with hypertension and CHD were relatively low. While the cause of this observation remains uncertain, it could probably be explained, at least partially, by the cardioprotective effect of concomitant treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective To evaluate the effect of a 1-year hybrid closed-loop (HCL) system on glycemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) previously treated with multiple daily injections (MDI). Methods This was a 1-year observational study, as a continuation of the previous 3 months prospective study of pediatric patients with T1D conducted at Sidra Medicine in Qatar. The study enrolled individuals aged 7–18 years with T1D &gt; 1 year, on MDI with self-monitoring of blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring, with no prior pump experience, and with an HbA1c level &lt; 12.5% (&lt; 113 mmol/mol). After the first 3 months of HCL use, patients were followed at 6, 9 and 12 months, where HbA1c was obtained and pump data were collected. Results All 30 participants (age 10.24 ± 2.6 years) who initiated HCL completed 12 months of HCL system use in Auto Mode. The participants used the sensor 88.4 ± 6.5% of the time with Auto Mode usage 85.6 ± 7.4% during 12 months of HCL system use. HbA1c decreased from 8.2 ± 1.4% (66 ± 15.3 mmol/mol) at baseline, to 6.7 ± 0.5% (50 ± 5.5 mmol/mol) at 3 months ( p = 0.02) and remained stable to 7.1 ± 0.6 (54 ± 6.6 mmol/mol) at 12 months ( p = 0.02). TIR (70–180 mg/dL) increased from 46.9% at baseline to 71.9% at 1 month and remained above 70% during the 12 months of HCL use. Conclusion HCL system (MiniMed 670G) in children and adolescents previously treated with MDI significantly improves glycemic outcomes (HbA1c and Time in Ranges) immediately during the first month. This improved glycemic control was maintained over the 1 year following Auto Mode initiation.",

Using the largest accelerometer cohort to date, we aimed to investigate whether there is an association between disease status and accelerometer variables after a 5-year follow-up.106,053 UK Biobank participants wore a wrist-worn GENEactiv monitor. Those with acceptable wear time (> 3 days) were split into 4 cardio-metabolic disease groups based on self-report disease status which was collected 5 ± 1 years prior. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate associations, controlling for confounders and stratified for gender.Average daily acceleration was lower in men ('healthy'-42 ± 15 mg v 'Type 2 diabetes + cardiovascular disease (CVD)'-31 ± 12 mg) and women ('healthy'-44 ± 13 mg v 'Type 2 diabetes + CVD'-31 ± 11 mg) with cardio-metabolic disease and this was consistent across both week and weekend days. Men and women with the worst cardio-metabolic disease perform around half of moderate to vigorous physical activity on a daily basis compared to healthy individuals, and spend almost 7 h per day in 30 min inactivity bouts. Significant associations were seen between cardio-metabolic disease and accelerometer variables 5 years on when controlling for confounders.In the largest accelerometer cohort to date, there are significant associations between cardio-metabolic disease and physical activity variables after 5 years of follow-up. Triaxial accelerometers provide enhanced measurement opportunities for measuring lifestyle behaviours in chronic disease.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated whether adipose tissue insulin resistance (IR) is affected by the degree of obesity during the fasting and post-prandial state, independent of glucose tolerance among obese children and adolescents. We also tested whether systemic subclinical inflammation is associated with adipose tissue IR. Subjects were recruited to the Yale Pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes in Youth Study (NCT01967849). An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed to establish glucose-tolerance status and blood samples were drawn for measurement of free fatty acids (FFAs), to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of FFA. Adipose tissue insulin resistance was calculated as the product of insulin and FFA concentrations. In total, 671 children and adolescents (58.6% females) were included with a mean age of 13.3(2.7) years and BMI Z score of 2.45(0.31). The degree of obesity emerged as an independent predictor of both fasting and post-prandial adipose IR, p < 0.0001. Higher degree of obesity was associated with greater AUC FFA (lower suppression) compared to lower degree of obesity, p = 0.01. Furthermore, higher levels of IL-6 were positively associated with post-prandial adipose tissue IR, p = 0.02. The degree of obesity in childhood and adolescence is strongly associated with adipose tissue IR independent of glucose tolerance. This is reflected not only in calculated indices of adipose IR but also in lower suppression of FFAs during the OGTT regardless of glucose tolerance or fasting adipose tissue IR. Furthermore, markers of subclinical inflammation such as IL-6 are associated with adipose tissue IR, independent of other factors.",

However, the vast majority of studies are representative of Asian and Caucasian population and fewer represent an African-American population.In this single-center, retrospective observational study, we included all adult patients (> 18 years old) admitted to Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients were classified according to having a known diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Demographic and clinical data, comorbidities, outcomes and laboratory findings were obtained.Our sample included a total of 355 patients. 70% were African-American, and 47% had diabetes. Patients with diabetes had higher peak inflammatory markers like CRP 184 (111-258) versus 142 (65-229) p = 0.012 and peak LDH 560 (384-758) versus 499 (324-655) p = 0.017. The need for RRT/HD was significantly higher in patients with diabetes (21% vs 11% p = 0.013) as well as the need for vasopressors (28% vs 18% p = 0.023). Only age was found to be an independent predictor of mortality. We found no significant differences in inpatient mortality p = 0.856, need for RRT/HD p = 0.429, need for intubation p = 1.000 and need for vasopressors p = 0.471 in African-Americans with diabetes when compared to non-African-Americans.Our study demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 and diabetes tend to have more severe disease and poorer clinical outcomes.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. Blood samples were obtained from 122 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with or without DR. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the association between plasma TMAO and DR. The diagnostic value of plasma TMAO was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Results In the T2DM patients, plasma levels of TMAO were significantly higher in patients with DR compared with those without DR ( P = 0.001). As logarithmic (ln) transformation of TMAO increased per standard deviation (SD), there was higher probability to have DR [odds ratio (OR) = 2.31; P = 0.005]. As ln-transformed TMAO increased per SD, the severity of DR was more likely to get worse (OR = 2.05; P = 0.004). In the diagnostic model, the addition of TMAO contributed to the improvement in AUROC from 0.646 to 0.734 ( P = 0.043), and the IDI was 10.7% ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Elevated levels of plasma TMAO were associated with higher odds and worse severity of DR in T2DM patients, and further investigation is required for the causality of this association.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide since the beginning of 2020, placing the heavy burden on the health systems all over the world. The population that particularly has been affected by the pandemic is the group of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. Having taken the public health in considerations, we have decided to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of diabetes mellitus on in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. A systematic literature review (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane) including all published clinical trials or observational studies published till December 10, 2020, was performed using following terms \"diabetes mellitus\" OR \"diabetes\" OR \"DM\" AND \"survival\" OR \"mortality\" AND \"SARS-CoV-2\" OR \"COVID-19\". Nineteen studies were included out of the 7327 initially identified studies. Mortality of DM patients vs non-DM patients was 21.3 versus 6.1%, respectively (OR = 2.39; 95%CI: 1.65, 3.64; P < 0.001), while severe disease in DM and non-DM group varied and amounted to 34.8% versus 22.8% (OR = 1.43; 95%CI: 0.82, 2.50; P = 0.20). In the DM group, the complications were observed far more often when compared with non-DM group, both in acute respiratory distress (31.4 vs. 17.2%; OR = 2.38; 95%CI:1.80, 3.13; P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (22.0% vs. 12.8%; OR = 2.59; 95%CI: 1.81, 3.73; P < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (19.1 vs. 10.2%; OR = 1.97; 95%CI: 1.36, 2.85; P < 0.001). Based on the findings, we shall conclude that diabetes is an independent risk factor of the severity of COVID-19 in-hospital settings; therefore, patients with diabetes shall aim to reduce the exposure to the potential infection of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the English NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) is to reduce the risk of sight loss amongst people with diabetes by the prompt identification and effective treatment if necessary of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy, at the appropriate stage during the disease process, with a long-term aim of preventing blindness in people with diabetes. For the year 2009–2010, diabetic retinopathy (DR) was no longer the leading cause of blindness in the working age group. There have been further reductions in DR certifications for WHO severe vision impairment and blindness from 1,334 (5.5% of all certifications) in 2009/2010 to 840 (3.5% of all certifications) in 2018/2019. NHS DESP is a major contributor to this further reduction, but one must also take into account improvements in glycaemic and blood pressure control, timely laser treatment and vitrectomy surgery, improved monitoring techniques for glycaemic control, and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor injections for control of diabetic macular oedema. The latter have had a particular impact since first introduced in the UK in 2013. Current plans for NHS DESP include extension of screening intervals in low-risk groups and the introduction of optical coherence tomography as a second line of screening for those with screen positive maculopathy with two dimensional markers. Future challenges include the introduction of automated analysis for grading and new camera technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a new class of antidiabetic drugs, are nephroprotective in case of diabetes, but whether a similar beneficial effect may be detectable also in case of chronic non-diabetic kidney diseases remains still unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of empagliflozin, a SGLT-2 inhibitor, on the progression of cyclosporine nephropathy, in the absence of diabetes. Methods Sprague Dawley rats ( n = 27) have been fed with low-salt diet starting 10 days before the beginning and finished at the end of the experimental period. Cyclosporine-A (CsA, 15 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal injection, n = 8) and CsA plus empagliflozin (Empa, 10 mg/kg/day, per os, n = 7) were administered for 4 weeks. The control groups were treated with placebo (Control, n = 7) or empagliflozin (Control + Empa, n = 5). Blood pressure (plethysmographic method) was measured at the beginning and at the end of the experimental period. At the end of the experimental protocol, the kidneys were excised for histomorphometric analysis of renal fibrosis and for immunohistochemical evaluation of inflammatory infiltrates (monocytes/macrophages), type I and type IV collagen expression, and tyrosine hydroxylase expression, used as marker of sympathetic nerve activity. Results CsA-treated rats showed a significant increase ( p &lt; 0.01) in blood pressure, which was reduced by administration of empagliflozin ( p &lt; 0.05). CsA administration caused an increase in glomerular and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis ( p &lt; 0.05), renal inflammatory infiltrates ( p &lt; 0.05), type I and type IV collagen expression ( p &lt; 0.01), and tyrosine hydroxylase expression ( p &lt; 0.01) as compared to the control rats and control + Empa-treated rats. Treatment with empagliflozin in CsA-treated rats reduced glomerular ( p &lt; 0.01) and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis ( p &lt; 0.05), type I and type IV collagen expression ( p &lt; 0.01), inflammatory cell infiltration ( p &lt; 0.01) and tyrosine hydroxylase expression ( p &lt; 0.05), as compared to rats treated with CsA. Conclusion Empagliflozin administration caused a reduction in blood pressure in CsA-treated rats and showed a protective effect on CsA nephropathy by decreasing renal fibrosis, type I and type IV collagen expression, macrophage infiltration and tyrosine hydroxylase expression. These data suggest that empagliflozin promotes nephroprotection also in non-diabetic kidney disease.",

Here, we evaluate the association between s-Klotho levels, glycemic control and renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).This is a cross-sectional study including 2989 patients with T2D and available s-Klotho measurements from the 2007-2016 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (mean ± SE, age: 60.0 ± 0.2 years, BMI 33.3 ± 0.2 kg/m2, 46.7 ± 1.3% female). Determination of s-Klotho concentrations was performed with a sandwich ELISA test.Patients with higher s-Klotho levels were younger, more frequently female and had a lower prevalence of CKD and higher HbA1c levels. In multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age, race-ethnicity and BMI, both estimated glomerular filtration rate (B = 2.21, 95% CI 1.41-3.01, p < 0.001) and hemoglobin A1c (B = 37.38, 95% CI 28.91-45.86, p < 0.001) were positively associated with s-Klotho, while no significant association was found with cardiovascular disease. Results were confirmed when analyses were performed in men and women separately. No significant differences were identified between patients with an albuminuric or non-albuminuric CKD phenotype.s-Klotho levels are dependent on kidney function and glycemic control in patients with T2D. Additional studies elucidating the mechanisms linking glycemic control and s-Klotho levels and exploring their predictive ability of clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with diabetes are needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims This study aims to compare the performance of a handheld fundus camera (Eyer) and standard tabletop fundus cameras (Visucam 500, Visucam 540, and Canon CR-2) for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema screening. Methods This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study that included images from 327 individuals with diabetes. The participants underwent pharmacological mydriasis and fundus photography in two fields (macula and optic disk centered) with both strategies. All images were acquired by trained healthcare professionals, de-identified, and graded independently by two masked ophthalmologists, with a third senior ophthalmologist adjudicating in discordant cases. The International Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy was used for grading, and demographic data, diabetic retinopathy classification, artifacts, and image quality were compared between devices. The tabletop senior ophthalmologist adjudication label was used as the ground truth for comparative analysis. A univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the relationship of each independent factor in referable diabetic retinopathy. Results The mean age of participants was 57.03 years (SD 16.82, 9–90 years), and the mean duration of diabetes was 16.35 years (SD 9.69, 1–60 years). Age ( P = .005), diabetes duration ( P = .004), body mass index ( P = .005), and hypertension ( P &lt; .001) were statistically different between referable and non-referable patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a positive association between male sex (OR 1.687) and hypertension (OR 3.603) with referable diabetic retinopathy. The agreement between devices for diabetic retinopathy classification was 73.18%, with a weighted kappa of 0.808 (almost perfect). The agreement for macular edema was 88.48%, with a kappa of 0.809 (almost perfect). For referable diabetic retinopathy, the agreement was 85.88%, with a kappa of 0.716 (substantial), sensitivity of 0.906, and specificity of 0.808. As for image quality, 84.02% of tabletop fundus camera images were gradable and 85.31% of the Eyer images were gradable. Conclusions Our study shows that the handheld retinal camera Eyer performed comparably to standard tabletop fundus cameras for diabetic retinopathy and macular edema screening. The high agreement with tabletop devices, portability, and low costs makes the handheld retinal camera a promising tool for increasing coverage of diabetic retinopathy screening programs, particularly in low-income countries. Early diagnosis and treatment have the potential to prevent avoidable blindness, and the present validation study brings evidence that supports its contribution to diabetic retinopathy early diagnosis and treatment.",

The sample included both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Each patient received a 50°, macula centered, non-mydriatic fundus photography and, after pupil dilation, a complete fundus examination by an experienced retina specialist. All images were after analyzed by a skilled operator and by the AI algorithm. The results of the three procedures were then compared.The agreement between the operator-based fundus analysis in bio-microscopy and the fundus photographs was of 100%. Among the DR patients the AI algorithm revealed signs of DR in 121 out of 125 subjects (96.8%) and no signs of DR 122 of the 126 non-diabetic patients (96.8%). The sensitivity of the AI algorithm was 96.8% and the specificity 96.8%. The overall concordance coefficient k (95% CI) between AI-based assessment and fundus biomicroscopy was 0.935 (0.891-0.979).The Aurora fundus camera is effective in a first line screening of DR. Its in-built AI software can be considered a reliable tool to automatically identify the presence of signs of DR and therefore employed as a promising resource in large screening campaigns.",

GDM is a risk factor of adverse perinatal outcomes, with the incidence rate increasing proportionally to the level of maternal dysglycaemia. Therefore, glycaemic control plays an important role in management of GDM. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of flash glucose monitoring (FGM) in GDM. Materials and methods This was a non-blinded, randomised controlled trial, that recruited 100 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation at the 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical University of Warsaw. After meeting the inclusion criteria patients were randomly allocated to the study group (FGM, n = 50) or control group (self-monitoring of blood glucose—SMBG, n = 50). Clinical and laboratory results were assessed at four follow-up visits. The primary outcome was mean fasting and postprandial glycaemia. The secondary outcomes were perinatal outcomes. Results There was no significant difference in mean glycaemia between the groups ( p = 0.437) Compared to the control group, the study group significantly reduced their fasting ( p = 0.027) and postprandial glycaemia ( p = 0.034) during the first 4 weeks following GDM diagnosis, with no significant difference in progression to insulin therapy (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.47–2.57) . Incidence of fetal macrosomia was significantly higher in SMBG as compared to FGM group (OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.16–27.22). Conclusions Study results indicate that FGM has an impact on glycaemic control, dietary habits and incidence of fetal macrosomia in patients with GDM.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims To explore the predictive value of ferroptosis-related (FR) biomarkers for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods This prospective observational study enrolled patients with T2DM at the Second Hospital of Jilin University between December 2021 and March 2022. DKD was measured by the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of ferroptosis-related biomarkers for DKD.The risk factors for massive proteinuria were performed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Finally, 118 patients (53.0 ± 12.2 years, 76 males) were enrolled, 52 of them without DKD (had normal proteinuria), while 66 with DKD. (Forty-one had microproteinuria, and 25 had massive proteinuria.) FR biomarkers, including acyl-CoA synthase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), were significantly higher in the massive proteinuria group than in the other groups, while glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was significantly lower (all P &lt; 0.05). The area under the ROC of the combination of GPX4, ACSL4, MDA, and ROS for predicting DKD was 0.804 (P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the course of disease and ferritin levels were independent risk factors for massive proteinuria, while high serum iron, transferrin, and GPX4 levels were independent protective factors for massive proteinuria in patients with T2DM (all P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The GPX4, ACSL4, MDA, and ROS combination might have a good predictive value for DKD. Additionally, the course of disease, ferritin levels, serum iron, transferrin, and GPX4 were independently associated with massive proteinuria.",

Methods A comprehensive review of international diabetes guidelines and a search of medical literature was performed to identify studies presenting data on the use of metformin in pregnancy. The document was approved by the councils of the two scientific societies. Results In condition affecting the fertility, as PCOS, metformin use in pre-conception or early in pregnancy may be beneficial for clinical pregnancy, even in ART treatment, and in obese-PCOS women may reduce preterm delivery. In obese women, even in the presence of GDM or T2DM, metformin use in pregnancy is associated with a lower gestational weight gain. In pregnancy complicated by diabetes (GDM or T2DM), metformin improves maternal glycemic control and may reduce insulin dose. Neonatal and infant outcomes related to metformin exposure in utero are lacking. Metformin use in women with GDM or T2DM is associated with lower birth weight. However, an increased tendency to overweight–obesity has been observed in children, later in life. Conclusions Metformin may represent a therapeutic option in selected women with obesity, PCOS, GDM, T2DM, and in women undergoing ART. However, more research is required specifically on the long-term effects of in utero exposition to metformin.",

    "abstract": "The role of the gut microbiota in the induction of metabolic diseases has now been increasingly recognized worldwide. Indeed, a specific gut microbiota has been shown to characterize lean versus obese phenotypes both in humans and mice. We have also recently demonstrated that a precise gut microbiota is associated with the host's responsiveness to a high-fat diet. Therefore, we hypothesized that insulin resistance in humans could also be linked to a specific gut microbiota. To this aim, microbial DNA and RNA were extracted from the appendix contents of insulin-resistant versus insulin-sensitive obese subjects, matched for body mass index and age, and analyzed by DNA- and RNA-DGGE. Microbial DNA analysis showed that the patients fully segregated according to their degree of insulin action. Conversely, microbial RNA investigation showed that some degree of homology still existed between insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant patients. Quantitative trait analysis, ordinary least squares regression, principal components regression, partial least squares, canonical correlation analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis also showed a net separation of the two phenotypes analyzed. We conclude that a specific gut microbial profile is associated with insulin action in humans.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined the clinical conditions and predictors of death in non-diabetic patients with pre-hospital severe hypoglycemia.From January 2006 to March 2012, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records to assess the patients with pre-hospital severe hypoglycemia at a national center in Japan. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as the presence of any hypoglycemic symptoms requiring the medical assistance of another person. The patients were followed up for 90 days after the severe hypoglycemia episode.A total of 59,602 consecutive cases that visited the emergency room were screened, and 530 patients with severe hypoglycemia were included in the subsequent analysis. The mean blood glucose levels in the non-diabetes (non-DM, n = 163) and diabetes (DM, n = 367) groups were 42.9 and 33.7 mg/dL, respectively. The incidence of extremely abnormal QT prolongation (corrected QT interval ≥0.50 s) was high in both groups [22.1 vs. 14.7 % (P = 0.11)]. Mortalities within 90 days after severe hypoglycemia were significantly higher in the non-DM group than in the DM group [20.3 vs. 1.6 % (P < 0.001)]. In addition to patient age, preexisting advanced liver disease and cancer, and the coexistence of sepsis, a blood glucose level of <40 mg/dL was identified as a strong predictor of death in the non-DM group using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models (hazard ratio 3.75; 95 % confidence interval 1.52-9.27; P = 0.004).Death in non-diabetic patients with severe hypoglycemia was independently associated not only with age, advanced liver disease, cancer, and sepsis, but also with the blood glucose level upon arrival.",

    "abstract": "To examine differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between patients with and without diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and whether these differences can be explained by functional deficits.This was a cross-sectional study of 160 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 80 with DPN and 80 without. Assessments included HRQoL (health utility score derived from EQ-5D-5L), functional status measurements [muscle strength, timed up and go (TUG), five times sit-to-stand (FTSTS), functional reach, body sway velocity] and self-reported balance confidence [Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale].Mean utility scores were 0.67 ± 0.14 and 0.77 ± 0.16 in patients with and without DPN, respectively (p < 0.001). Patients with DPN had lower great toe extensor strength (6.4 ± 1.8 vs 7.6 ± 2.8 lbs, p = 0.001), greater body sway velocity (2.40 ± 1.31 vs 1.90 ± 0.52 mm/s, p = 0.002), slower TUG (12.1 ± 4.6 vs 10.1 ± 2.3 s, p < 0.001) and FTSTS (15.8 ± 5.8 vs 13.9 ± 5.4 s, p = 0.03) scores, and lower ABC score (73.4 ± 21.3 vs 82.6 ± 16.9, p = 0.003), compared to those without DPN. On stepwise multiple regression, DPN status, FTSTS, body sway velocity, BMI, diabetes duration, pain, and gender explained 38% of HRQoL variance. Addition of ABC score into the model explained 45% of variance. Results from structural equation modelling showed that DPN had direct effects on HRQoL and indirect effects through FTSTS, body sway velocity, and ABC score, with χ 2 = 8.075 (p = 0.044), root mean square error of approximation = 0.103 (lower bound 0.015, upper bound 0.191), Comparative Fit Index = 0.966, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.887, and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.053.Patients with DPN have worse HRQoL compared to patients without DPN, partly mediated by functional status parameters. Effective interventions targeting functional status may be beneficial in improving HRQoL in these patients.",

Selected diabetes-related autoantibodies such as GAD-ab, IA2-ab, ZnT8-ab were tested before the initiation of insulin therapy. Diabetic ketoacidosis was defined as glucose concentration > 13.9 mmol/l, pH < 7.30, concentration of HCO3 < 15 mmol/l, presence of ketone bodies in the blood and urine.The autoantibodies pattern differs in both study groups. Children were mostly positive for two (37.8%) and three (49.5%) autoantibodies, whereas adults for one (32.2%) and two (30.7%). The most frequently detected autoantibodies in youth were ZnT8-ab (81.1%) and IA2-ab (80.7%), while in adults GAD-ab (74.8%). ZnT8-ab (p < 0.0001) titers were significantly higher in children, but adults had higher titer of GAD-ab (p < 0.0001) and IA2-ab (p < 0.0001). Children developed more frequently diabetic ketoacidosis (28.4 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.0002). ZnT8-ab (p = 0.002) and IA2-ab (p = 0.008) were reported mostly in individuals with ketoacidosis. A correlation between the number of positive antibodies and the severity of ketoacidosis was observed (Rs - 0.129 p = 0.014). ZnT8-ab were associated with a greater risk of ketoacidosis independent of gender, age group and the autoantibodies number [OR = 2.44 (95% CI 1.0-5.94), p = 0.04].Children are at greater risk of ketoacidosis at the diagnosis of diabetes. ZnT8-ab and IA2-ab are commonly detected in children, while adults have frequently higher titer of GAD-ab. ZnT8-ab are associated with more acute diabetes onset.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) face the daily task of implementing self-management strategies to achieve their glycaemic goals. The UK COVID-19 lockdown has had an impact on day-to-day behaviour, which may affect diabetes self-management and outcomes. We assessed whether sensor-based outcomes pre- and during lockdown periods were different in a cohort of glucose sensor users with T1D. Methods Data were collected from Freestyle Libre (FSL) or Dexcom G6 sensor users who remotely shared their data with the diabetes clinic web platform. Sensor metrics according to international consensus were analysed and compared between pre-lockdown period and 2 and 3 weeks into lockdown (periods 1 and 2). Results Two hundred and sixty-nine T1D patients (baseline HbA1c 57 ± 14 mmol/mol) were identified as FSL ( n = 190) or Dexcom G6 ( n = 79) users. In patients with sensor use &gt; 70% ( N = 223), compared to pre-lockdown period percentage TIR 3.9–10 mM (TIR) significantly increased during period 1 (59.6 ± 18.2 vs. 57.5 ± 17.2%, p = 0.002) and period 2 (59.3 ± 18.3 vs. 57.5 ± 17.2%, p = 0.035). The proportion of patients achieving TIR ≥ 70% increased from 23.3% pre-lockdown to 27.8% in period 1 and 30.5% in period 2. A higher proportion also achieved the recommended time below and above range, and coefficient of variation in periods 1 and 2. Dexcom G6 users had significantly lower % time below range (&lt; 3.9 mM) compared to FSL users during both lockdown periods (period 1: Dexcom G6 vs. FSL: 1.8% vs. 4%; period 2: 1.4% vs. 4%, p &lt; 0.005 for both periods). Conclusion Sensor-based glycaemic outcomes in people with T1D in the current cohort improved during COVID-19 lockdown, which may be associated with positive changes in self-management strategies. Further work is required to evaluate long-term sustainability and support.",

Methods Meta-analysis of observational studies reporting measures of glucose control and variability before and during and/or after periods of confinement caused by COVID-19 in 2020 and/or 2021. Results We included 27 studies on T1DM. No significant change in Hba1c was observed after lockdown (WMD − 1.474 [− 3.26; 0.31] mmol/mol, I 2 = 93.9). TIR significantly increased during and after lockdown (WMD: 2.73 1.47; 4.23 %, I 2 = 81% and 3.73 [1.13; 5.33] %, I 2 = 85%, respectively).We retrieved nine studies on T2DM patients. No significant variation in HbA1c was detected (WMD − 1.257 − 3.91; 1.39 mmol/mol, I 2 = 98.3%). HbA1c had a more favourable trend in studies performed in Asia than in Europe ( p = 0.022 between groups). Conclusion Lockdown showed no significant detrimental effect on HbA1c in either T1DM or T2DM. Conversely, home confinement led to a reduction in mean glucose and glucose variability in T1DM, although with a high heterogeneity of results.",

    "abstract": "A family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) markedly increases an individual's lifetime risk of developing the disease. For gestational diabetes (GDM), this risk factor is less well characterized. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between family history of T2DM in first- and second-degree relatives in women with GDM and the differences in metabolic characteristics at early gestation.This prospective cohort study included 1129 pregnant women. A broad risk evaluation was performed before 16 + 0 weeks of gestation, including a detailed family history of the different types of diabetes and a laboratory examination of glucometabolic parameters. Participants were followed up until delivery and GDM assessed according to the latest diagnosis criteria.We showed that pregnant women with first- (FHD1, 26.6%, OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.16 to 3.16, p = 0.005), second- (FHD2, 26.3%, OR 1.88, 95%CI 1.16 to 3.05, p = 0.005) or both first- and second-degree relatives with T2DM (FHD1 + D2, 33.3%, OR 2.64, 95%CI 1.41 to 4.94, p < 0.001) had a markedly increased risk of GDM compared to those with negative family history (FHN) (n = 100, 15.9%). The association was strongest if both parents were affected (OR 4.69, 95%CI 1.33 to 16.55, p = 0.009). Women with FHD1 and FHD1 + D2 had adverse glucometabolic profiles already in early pregnancy.Family history of T2DM is an important risk factor for GDM, also by applying the current diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, we showed that the degree of kinship plays an essential role in quantifying the risk already at early pregnancy.",

Methods This was a retrospective observational study conducted in a diabetes clinic. Changes in HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG), weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, and number of antihypertensive drugs at 32 weeks (T1) after the first prescription of semaglutide (T0) were analyzed. Furthermore, at T1 patients were asked to fill-in the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) and the Control of Eating Questionnaire (COEQ). Results Overall, 104 patients were identified (mean age 63.6 ± 10.4 years, 58.7% men, diabetes duration 12.7 ± 8.7 years). After 32 weeks of treatment with semaglutide, HbA1c levels were reduced by 1.38%, FBG by − 56.53 mg/dl, weight by 6.03 kg. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total, HDL-, LDL-, and non –HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides significantly improved. The number of glucose-lowering and antihypertensive drugs also decreased. At T1, DTSQ score was 32.23 ± 1.44, whereas COEQ indicated low levels of hunger and good control of eating. Conclusions The study documented benefits of semaglutide on metabolic control and multiple CV risk factors, simplification of therapeutic schemes and high satisfaction with diabetes treatment, and eating behaviors indicative of healthy diet and reduced food intake.",

Methods Data were collected from 692 patients (47.5% female, with a median age of 47.4 years) who used FGM systems daily and recorded their clinical variables and device data. Results Logistic regression models showed that performing more than 12 scans per day was associated with improved T1D control (OR = 4.22, p &lt; 0.001) and a reduction in HbA1c (7.6 vs 7.0%, 60–53 mmol/mol p &lt; 0.001). However, those performing less than 6 scans showed no improvement in HbA1c (7.9 vs 7.8%, 63–61 mmol/mol p = 0.514). Thirteen daily scans were determined as the optimal cutoff point for predicting optimal glycemic control using a maximally selected rank algorithm. Significant reductions were observed in mean glucose (&lt; 0.001), coefficient of variation (&lt; 0.001), HbA1c (&lt; 0.001), and an increase in TIR (&lt; 0.001) in patients who performed more than 12 daily scans. Conclusions The results suggest that a higher frequency of daily scans by T1D patients using FGM systems leads to improved chronic glycemic control. The minimum recommended frequency for optimal control is 13 scans per day, and more than 6 daily scans are needed to improve HbA1c.",

Our aim is to assess efficacy and effectiveness of the currently available live-attenuated zoster vaccine (LZV) and recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in adults with DM. Methods A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of clinical trials and observational studies comparing incidence of HZ and its complications in vaccinated and unvaccinated people with DM was performed, on PubMed, Cochrane, Clinical Trials.gov and Embase databases, up to January 15th, 2023. Risk of bias was assessed through the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. The protocol was registered on the PROSPERO website (CRD42022370705). Results Only three observational studies reported LZV efficacy and effectiveness in people with DM. A lower risk for HZ infection (MH-OH Ratio 95% CI = 0.52 [0.49, 0.56] was observed, for unadjusted analysis, and 0.51 [0.46, 0.56] for adjusted analysis, both with P &lt; 0.00001 and no heterogeneity). No data on LZV safety were reported. A pooled analysis of two trials comparing RZV and placebo, showed a reduced risk for HZ incidence: (95% CI Odds Ratio: 0.09 [0.04–0.19]), with no difference in severe adverse events and mortality. Conclusions In our meta-analysis of three observational studies LZV showed a 48% effectiveness in reducing HZ incidence in adults with diabetes whereas in a pooled analysis of two RCTs, RZV showed a 91% efficacy. No data are available on the effects of vaccination on the incidence and severity of HZ-related complications among subjects with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) allows a large degree of treatment individualization and intensification in children with diabetes. The study's aim was to evaluate the impact of treatment with CSII on glycated haemoglobin level (HbA1c) in children with diabetes and investigate whether introduction of CSII is associated with an increased risk of acute complications of diabetes. Patients treated throughout the recruitment period exclusively with multiple daily injections (MDI) were matched for duration of diabetes and HbA1c level at baseline with patients treated exclusively with CSII in a 1:1 group ratio (n = 223 and 231 for MDI and CSII, respectively). The CSII group showed lower HbA1c after the observation period (7.98 ± 1.38 vs. 7.56 ± 0.97; P = 0.002). HbA1c variability measured as standard deviations of average values was also lower in the CSII group (0.73 ± 0.45 vs. 0.84 ± 0.54; P = 0.049). The rate of hospitalization due to acute events was similar in both groups (14.7/100 vs. 14.0/100 person/years in the MDI and CSII group, P = 0.72). Duration of hospital stay per year was on average 1.25 days shorter in the CSII group (P = 0.0004), but the risk of acute complications resulting in hospitalization did not differ between the groups (hazard ratio (HR) 1.16; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.68-1.63). The most significant risk factor for hospitalization due to acute complications was baseline HbA1c concentration (HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14-1.37). In conclusion, CSII treatment may improve glycemic control and reduce its variability. Change of MDI to CSII does not alter the risk of hospitalization and may reduce the annual duration of hospitalization in children with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether basal insulin as first-line treatment in recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) can improve glucose control, microvascular function and preserve insulin secretion in comparison with metformin (MET). In this open-label, randomized, prospective 36-week study, 75 patients (44 m, 31 f, mean age 60.7 ± 9.2 year) were allocated to treatment with either MET 1,000 mg b.i.d. (n = 36) or insulin glargine (GLA) at bedtime (n = 39). At baseline and study end, we performed a continuous glucose monitoring for assessment of interstitial glucose (IG) and measured microvascular function using Laser-Doppler fluxmetry. GLA versus MET treatment resulted in a more pronounced reduction in FPG (Δ: 3.1 ± 2.5 vs. 1.4 ± 1.5 mmol/l; p < 0.001) and overall IG (Δ AUC. 671 ± 507 vs. 416 ± 537 mmol/l min; p = 0.04). Postprandial PG and IG differences after a standardized test meal did not reach significance. Proinsulin/C-peptide and HOMA B as marker of endogenous insulin secretion were significantly more improved by GLA. Microvascular blood flow improved only in MET-treated patients. Early basal insulin treatment with GLA in T2D patients provided a better control of FPG, overall IG load and biomarker of beta-cell function compared to the standard treatment with MET. MET treatment resulted in an improvement of microvascular function. Studies of longer duration are needed to evaluate the durability of glucose control and β cell protection with early GLA treatment.",

    "abstract": "Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes is prevalent in China, in contrast to childhood-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus. Islet autoantibodies are the most important immune biomarkers to diagnose autoimmune diabetes. We assayed four different islet autoantibodies in recently diagnosed adult non-insulin-requiring diabetes Chinese subjects to investigate the best antibody assay strategy for the correct diagnosis of these subjects.LADA China study is a nation-wide multicenter study conducted in diabetes patients from 46 university-affiliated hospitals in China. Non-insulin-treated newly diagnosed adult diabetes patients (n = 2388) were centrally assayed for glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADA), protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 autoantibody (IA-2A), and zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8A) by radioligand assay and insulin autoantibody (IAA) by microtiter plate radioimmunoassay. Clinical data were determined locally.Two hundred and six (8.63 %) subjects were autoantibody positive, of which GADA identified 5.78 % (138/2388) of the total, but only 67 % (138/206) of the autoimmune cases. IA-2A, ZnT8A, and IAA were found in 1.51, 1.84, and 1.26 % of the total study subjects, respectively. When assaying three islet autoantibodies, the most effective strategy was the combination of GADA, ZnT8A, and IAA, which could identify 92.2 % (190/206) autoimmune diabetes patients. The clinical data showed that those subjects with positive GADA had lower random C-peptide than autoantibody negative subjects (P < 0.05).As with Europeans, GADA is the dominant autoantibody in this form of autoimmune diabetes in China, but in contrast to Europeans, screening should include other diabetes-associated autoantibodies.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of diabetes and diabetes treatment with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.Histologically confirmed incident cases of postmenopausal breast (N = 916) cancer were recruited from 23 Spanish public hospitals. Population-based controls (N = 1094) were randomly selected from primary care center lists within the catchment areas of the participant hospitals. ORs (95 % CI) were estimated using mixed-effects logistic regression models, using the recruitment center as a random effect term. Breast tumors were classified into hormone receptor positive (ER+ or PR+), HER2+ and triple negative (TN).Diabetes was not associated with the overall risk of breast cancer (OR 1.09; 95 % CI 0.82-1.45), and it was only linked to the risk of developing TN tumors: Among 91 women with TN tumors, 18.7 % were diabetic, while the corresponding figure among controls was 9.9 % (OR 2.25; 95 % CI 1.22-4.15). Regarding treatment, results showed that insulin use was more prevalent among diabetic cases (2.5 %) as compared to diabetic controls (0.7 %); OR 2.98; 95 % CI 1.26-7.01. They also showed that, among diabetics, the risk of developing HR+/HER2- tumors decreased with longer metformin use (ORper year 0.89; 95 % CI 0.81-0.99; based on 24 cases and 43 controls).This study reinforces the need to correctly classify breast cancers when studying their association with diabetes. Given the low survival rates in women diagnosed with TN breast tumors and the potential impact of diabetes control on breast cancer prevention, more studies are needed to better characterize this association.",

    "abstract": "It has in recent years been established that epigenetic changes contribute to β-cell dysfunction and type 2 diabetes (T2D). For example, we have showed that the expression of histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) is increased in pancreatic islets of individuals with T2D and that increased levels of Hdac7 in β-cells impairs insulin secretion. The HDAC inhibitor MC1568 rescued this secretory impairment, suggesting that inhibitors specific for HDAC7 may be useful clinically in the treatment of T2D. The aim of the current study was to further explore HDAC7 as a novel therapeutic target in T2D.Hdac7 was overexpressed in clonal β-cells followed by the analysis of insulin secretion, mitochondrial function, as well as cell number and apoptosis in the presence or absence of MC1568. Furthermore, the effect of MC1568 on insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets from non-diabetic donors and donors with T2D was also studied.Overexpression of Hdac7 in clonal β-cells significantly reduced insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP content, while it increased apoptosis. These impairments were all rescued by treatment with MC1568. The inhibitor also increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets from donors with T2D, while having no effect on islets from non-diabetic donors.HDAC7 inhibition protects β-cells from mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, and increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets from human T2D donors. Our study supports specific HDAC7 inhibitors as novel options in the treatment of T2D.",

Methods Prospective observational analysis as part of the Finnish diabetic nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study with a mean follow-up time of 10.7 years was performed. A total of 1612 individuals with type 1 diabetes were recruited, and LTPA was assessed at baseline using a validated self-report questionnaire. Severe diabetic retinopathy was defined as the initiation of laser treatment due to severe nonproliferative, proliferative retinopathy or diabetic maculopathy (identified from the Care Register for Health Care). Results A total of 261 patients received laser treatment during the follow-up. Higher frequency of LTPA was associated with a lower incidence of severe diabetic retinopathy ( p = 0.024), a finding that remained significant after adjustment for gender, duration, age at onset of diabetes, kidney function, BMI, triglycerides and systolic blood pressure. However, when HbA 1c and smoking were added to the Cox regression model the association was no more significant. Conclusions Frequent LTPA is associated with a lower incidence of severe diabetic retinopathy during the follow-up. The total amount or the other components of LTPA (intensity or duration of a single session) were not associated with severe diabetic retinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Despite improvement in diabetic care over the years, the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is still very high. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine risk factors for PE in women with T1DM.This study was a prospective, nested case-control study on a population of 165 women with T1DM. Women were divided into 3 subgroups: normotensive (N = 141), gestational hypertension (GH) (N = 8), and PE (N = 16). Clinical data were collected in the first trimester (< 12th week), in mid-pregnancy (20-24th weeks), and just prior to delivery (34-39th weeks). IR in the first trimester was quantified using the estimated glucose disposal rate formula (eGDR, milligrams/kilogram/minute). Simple logistic regression was used to search for factors associated with PE and GH. For multivariate comparisons, we used multiple logistic regression with stepwise selection.All preeclampsia cases were diagnosed in primiparae. The presence of vasculopathy was the strongest determinant of PE (OR 10.8, 95% CI 3.27-35.97, P = 0.0001), followed by a history of chronic hypertension (6.05, 1.75-20.8, P = 0.004) and the duration of diabetes (1.11, 1.03-1.12, P = 0.009). However, chronic hypertension and duration of diabetes were no longer associated with PE after adjustment for the presence of vasculopathy. Higher gestational weight gain (GWG) was associated with PE, and this association remained significant after adjustment for first trimester body mass index (1.14, 1.02-1.28, P = 0.02). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure assessed in the first trimester were significant determinants of PE; however, this association was no longer observed after adjustment for the presence of chronic hypertension. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels from all 3 trimesters were significantly associated with PE (first trimester: 1.38, 1.01-1.87, P = 0.04; second trimester: 2.76, 1.43-5.31, P = 0.002; third trimester: 2.42, 1.30-4.51, P = 0.005). There was a negative association between eGDR and PE (0.66, 0.50-0.87, P = 0.003). Among lipids, triglycerides (TG) in all 3 trimesters were positively associated with PE, and this association was independent of HbA1c levels (first trimester: 5.32, 1.65-17.18, P = 0.005; second trimester: 2.52, 1.02-6.26, P = 0.05; third trimester: 2.28, 1.39-3.74, P = 0.001. We did not find any predictors of GH in the regression analysis among all analyzed factors.Primiparity and diabetic vasculopathy seem to be the strongest risk factors for PE in women with type 1 diabetes. However, preexisting hypertension and higher GWG were also associated with PE in women with T1DM. Among laboratory results, higher HbA1c and TG levels in all 3 trimesters were associated with PE. The association between higher IR and PE in women with T1DM needs further study.",

Methods The study was carried out between June 2018 and May 2019 on 324 patients (162 females, 162 males) with type 2 diabetes. To measure the levels of self-care, the Self-Care of Diabetes Index (SCODI) questionnaire was used. Adherence to treatment was assessed with the Adherence in Chronic Diseases Scale (ACDS). Results The highest scores of health behaviour were on the subscale of adherence with the mean value of 68.37, and the lowest results on the subscale of blood sugar self-monitoring, with the mean of 56.05. We found that low adherence to treatment was present in 52.47% of respondents, the moderate level in 39.20%, while only 8.33% of patients showed the high level. There were significant positive correlations between the ACDS and SCODI subscales ( p &lt; 0.05): self-care maintenance (0.436), self-care management (0.413), self-care monitoring (0.384), and self-care confidence (0.453). Conclusions Self-care affects on adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes. The higher self-efficacy in each of the areas of functioning, the higher the level of adherence to treatment. We found that demographic variables such as female sex, education and employment status can influence self-care in managing chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes.",

Methods In total, 500,973 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes of all ages registered in the diabetes patient follow-up (DPV) were included. Analysis was stratified by age (≤ / &gt; 20 years) and by manifestation/follow-up. Patients were categorized into three groups: HHS or DKA—during follow-up according to the most recent episode—or ND. Results At onset of diabetes, HHS criteria were met by 345 (68.4% T1D) and DKA by 9824 (97.6% T1D) patients. DKA patients had a lower BMI(-SDS) in both diabetes types compared to ND. HbA1c was higher in HHS/DKA. During follow-up, HHS occurred in 1451 (42.2% T1D) and DKA in 8389 patients (76.7% T1D). In paediatric T1D, HHS/DKA was associated with younger age, depression, and dyslipidemia. Pump usage was less frequent in DKA patients. In adult T1D/T2D subjects, metabolic control was worse in patients with HHS/DKA. HHS and DKA were also associated with excessive alcohol intake, dementia, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and depression. Conclusions HHS/DKA occurred mostly in T1D and younger patients. However, both also occurred in T2D, which is of great importance in the treatment of diabetes. Better education programmes are necessary to prevent decompensation and comorbidities.",

Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for risk factors for complications (age, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, HbA1c and duration of type 2 diabetes) were used to analyze the incidence of microvascular complications in men and women.The incidence of microalbuminuria was significantly higher in men (HR microalbuminuria 1.64 [CI 1.21-2.24], p = 0.002). Additionally, men are more likely to develop two or three microvascular complications compared to women (OR 2.42 [CI 1.69-3.45], p < 0.001).This study shows that men with type 2 diabetes are more likely to develop microvascular complications, especially microalbuminuria. Furthermore, men seem to have a higher chance of developing multiple microvascular complications. Our results highlight that men and women may not benefit to a similar extent from current treatment approaches to prevent diabetes-related microvascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Since 2010, more than half of World population lives in Urban Environments. Urban Diabetes has arisen as a novel nosological entity in Medicine. Urbanization leads to the accrual of a number of factors increasing the vulnerability to diabetes mellitus and related diseases. Herein we report clinical-epidemiological data of the Milano Metropolitan Area in the contest of the Cities Changing Diabetes Program. Since the epidemiological picture was taken in January 2020, on the edge of COVID-19 outbreak in the Milano Metropolitan Area, a perspective addressing potential interactions between diabetes and obesity prevalence and COVID-19 outbreak, morbidity and mortality will be presented. To counteract lock-down isolation and, in general, social distancing a pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility and efficacy of tele-monitoring via Flash Glucose control in a cohort of diabetic patients in ASST North Milano. Methods Data presented derive from 1. ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics of Italy), 2. Milano ATS web site (Health Agency of Metropolitan Milano Area), which entails five ASST (Health Agencies in the Territories). A pilot study was conducted in 65 screened diabetic patients (only 40 were enrolled in the study of those 36 were affected by type 2 diabetes and 4 were affected by type 1 diabetes) of ASST North Milano utilizing Flash Glucose Monitoring for 3 months (mean age 65 years, HbA1c 7,9%. Patients were subdivided in 3 groups using glycemic Variability Coefficient (VC): a. High risk, VC &gt; 36, n. 8 patients; Intermediate risk 20 &lt; VC &lt; 36, n. 26 patients; Low risk VC &lt; 20, n. 4 patients. The control group was constituted by 26 diabetic patients non utilizing Flash Glucose monitoring. Results In a total population of 3.227.264 (23% is over 65 y) there is an overall prevalence of 5.65% with a significant difference between Downtown ASST (5.31%) and peripheral ASST (ASST North Milano, 6.8%). Obesity and overweight account for a prevalence of 7.8% and 27.7%, respectively, in Milano Metropolitan Area. We found a linear relationship ( R = 0.36) between prevalence of diabetes and aging index. Similarly, correlations between diabetes prevalence and both older people depending index and structural dependence index ( R = 0.75 and R = 0.93, respectively), were found. A positive correlation ( R = 0.46) with percent of unoccupied people and diabetes prevalence was also found. A reverse relationship between diabetes prevalence and University level instruction rate was finally identified ( R = − 0.82). Our preliminary study demonstrated a reduction of Glycated Hemoglobin ( p = 0.047) at 3 months follow-up during the lock-down period, indicating Flash Glucose Monitoring and remote control as a potential methodology for diabetes management during COVID-19 lock-down. Hypothesis and discussion The increase in diabetes and obesity prevalence in Milano Metropolitan Area, which took place over 30 years, is related to several environmental factors. We hypothesize that some of those factors may have also determined the high incidence and virulence of COVID-19 in the Milano area. Health Agencies of Milano Metropolitan Area are presently taking care of diabetic patients facing the new challenge of maintaining sustainable diabetes care costs in light of an increase in urban population and of the new life-style. The COVID-19 pandemic will modify the management of diabetic and obese patients permanently, via the implementation of approaches that entail telemedicine technology. The pilot study conducted during the lock-down period indicates an improvement of glucose control utilizing a remote glucose control system in the Milano Metropolitan Area, suggesting a wider utilization of similar methodologies during the present “second wave” lock-down.",

We aim to evaluate the impact of organizational aspects of care on lower extremity amputation rates among people with type 2 diabetes affected by foot ulcers. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature published between 1999 and 2019, using the following key terms as search criteria: people with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcer, treated with specific processes and care pathways, and LEA as primary outcome. Overall results were reported as pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals obtained using fixed and random effects models. Results A total of 57 studies were found eligible, highlighting the following arrangements: dedicated teams, care pathways and protocols, multidisciplinary teams, and combined interventions. Among them, seven studies qualified for a meta-analysis. According to the random effects model, interventions including any of the four arrangements were associated with a 29% reduced risk of any type of lower extremity amputation (OR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.52–0.96). The effect was larger when focusing on major LEAs alone, leading to a 48% risk reduction (OR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.30–0.91). Conclusions Specific organizational arrangements including multidisciplinary teams and care pathways can prevent half of the amputations in people with diabetes and foot ulcers. Further studies using standardized criteria are needed to investigate the cost-effectiveness to facilitate wider implementation of improved organizational arrangements. Similarly, research should identify specific roadblocks to translating evidence into action. These may be structures and processes at the health system level, e.g. availability of professionals with the right skillset, reimbursement mechanisms, and clear organizational intervention implementation guidelines.",

Our aim was to evaluate the effect of PCSK9-i on inflammatory biomarkers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio (MHR), and on early atherosclerosis damage analyzed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) in a cohort of FH subjects. Methods In this prospective observational study, we evaluated 56 FH subjects on high-intensity statins plus ezetimibe and with an off-target LDL-C. All subjects were placed on PCSK9-i therapy and obtained biochemical analysis as well as PWV evaluation at baseline and after six months of PCSK9-i therapy. Results After six months of add-on PCSK9-i therapy, only 42.9% of FH subjects attained LDL-C targets. As expected, a significant reduction of LDL-C (− 49.61%, p &lt; 0.001) was observed after PCSK9-i therapy. Neutrophil count (NC) and MHR were reduced by PCSK9-i (-13.82% and -10.47%, respectively, p value for both &lt; 0.05) and PWV significantly decreased after PCSK9-i therapy (− 20.4%, p &lt; 0.05). Finally, simple regression analyses showed that ∆ PWV was significantly associated with ∆ LDL-C ( p &lt; 0.01), ∆ NC and ∆ MHR ( p value for both &lt; 0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, PCSK9-i therapy significantly improved lipid and inflammatory profiles and PWV values in FH subjects; our results support the positive effect of PCSK9-i in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The first reports of a link between thiamine and diabetes date back to the 1940s. Some years later, a role for thiamine deficiency in diabetic neuropathy became evident, and some pilot studies evaluated the putative effects of thiamine supplementation. However, the administration of thiamine and its lipophilic derivative benfotiamine for the treatment of this complication gained consensus only at the end of the '90 s. The first evidence of the beneficial effects of thiamine on microvascular cells involved in diabetic complications dates to 1996: from then on, several papers based on in vitro and animal models have addressed the potential use of this vitamin in counteracting diabetic microangiopathy. A few pilot studies in humans reported beneficial effects of thiamine administration on diabetic nephropathy, but, despite all promising proofs-of-concept, the possible role of thiamine in counteracting development or progression of retinopathy has not been addressed until now. Thiamine is a water-soluble vitamin, rapidly expelled from the body, with no issues of over-dosage or accumulation; unfortunately, it is non-patentable, and neither industry nor independent donors are interested in investing in large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials to investigate its potential in diabetes and its complications. Consequently, science will not be able to disprove a promising hypothesis and, more importantly, diabetic people remain deprived of a possible way to ameliorate their condition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Dyslipidemia in pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes as elevated triglycerides might be considered as a risk factor for hyperglycemia and gestational diabetes. As only a few studies have addressed the association between maternal triglycerides and glucose metabolism, we aimed to explore the pathophysiologic associations of moderate hypertriglyceridemia and maternal glucose metabolism in pregnancy. Methods Sixty-seven pregnant women received a detailed metabolic characterization at 12+0–22+6 weeks of gestation by an extended 2h-75g OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test); with measurements of glucose, insulin and C-peptide at fasting and every 30 min after ingestion and assessment of triglycerides at fasting state. All examinations were repeated at 24+0–27+6 weeks of gestation. Results Elevated triglycerides in early gestation were associated with insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. Mean glucose concentrations during the OGTT in early pregnancy were already higher in women with hypertriglyceridemia as compared to women with triglycerides in the normal range. A higher degree of insulin resistance and increased OGTT glucose levels were also observed when metabolic assessments were repeated between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. Of note, elevated triglycerides at early gestation were associated with development of gestational diabetes by logistic regression (odds ratio: 1.16, 95%CI: 1.03–1.34, p =0.022 for an increase of 10 mg/dl). Conclusions Hypertriglyceridemia at the start of pregnancy is closely related to impaired insulin action and β -cell function. Women with hypertriglyceridemia have higher mean glucose levels in early- and mid-gestation. Pregnant women with elevated triglycerides in early pregnancy are at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: To estimate the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a Danish cohort comparing the current Danish versus the WHO2013 diagnostic criteria, and to evaluate adverse pregnancy outcomes among currently untreated women in the gap between the diagnostic thresholds. METHODS: Diagnostic testing was performed by a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks' gestation in a cohort of pregnant women. GDM diagnosis was based on the current Danish criterion (2-h glucose ≥ 9.0 mmol/L, GDM DK) and on the WHO2013 criteria (fasting ≥ 5.1, 1 h ≥ 10.0 or 2 h glucose ≥ 8.5 mmol/L, GDM WHO2013). Currently untreated women fulfilling the WHO2013 but not the Danish diagnostic criteria were defined as New-GDM-women (GDM WHO2013-positive and GDM DK-negative). Adverse outcomes risks were calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: OGTT was completed by 465 women at a median of 25.7 weeks' gestation. GDM DK prevalence was 2.2% (N = 10) and GDM WHO2013 21.5% (N = 100). New-GDM was present in 19.4% (N = 90), of whom 90.0% had elevated fasting glucose. Pregnancies complicated by New-GDM had higher frequencies of pregnancy-induced hypertension (13.3% vs 4.1%, p = 0.002), large-for-gestational-age infants (22.2% vs 9.9%, p = 0.004), neonatal hypoglycaemia (8.9% vs 1.9%, p = 0.004) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (16.7% vs 5.8%, p = 0.002) compared to pregnancies without GDM. CONCLUSIONS: GDM prevalence increased tenfold when applying WHO2013 criteria in a Danish population, mainly driven by higher fasting glucose levels. Untreated GDM in the gap between the current Danish and the WHO2013 diagnostic criteria resulted in higher risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

In patients with T2DM, DKD was assessed by glomerular filtration rate (&lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration algorithm), proteinuria (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g), or both. Weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate the independent association between dietary live microbe and DKD. Results The study included 3836 participants, of whom 1467 (38.24%) had DKD for the diagnosis. Our study demonstrated that participants in the high dietary live microbe group were more likely to be older, female, non-Hispanic White, have higher education levels, have a lower prevalence of smoking, have a high poverty-income ratio, have higher energy intake, lower haemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum creatinine levels, and lower risk of progression. After adjustment for covariates, patients in the high dietary live microbe group had a low prevalence of DKD, whereas no significant association with DKD was found between the medium and low dietary live microbe groups. No statistically significant interaction was observed in all subgroup analyses except for HbA1c ( p for interaction &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Our results indicate that high dietary live microbe intake was associated with a low DKD prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims One of the primary pathological features in the early stages of diabetic nephropathy is mesangial cell (MC) hypertrophy in the glomerulus. Considering the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulating MC hypertrophy, the aim of this study was to identify the functional ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 5 (UBR5) during MC hypertrophy under high glucose conditions. Methods Human MCs (HMCs) transduced with UBR5 silencing or overexpression vector were treated with high glucose, AKT inhibitor, or glycolysis inhibitor. Cell proliferation, cell cycle, hypertrophy and glycolysis were evaluated in the HMCs after indicated treatment. m6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation were performed to determine the regulation of UBR5 by Wilms tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP)/insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) induced m6A modification. Western blot was performed to determine the protein expression levels. Results UBR5 expression was upregulated in db/db mice and in high glucose-induced HMCs. UBR5 silencing inhibited high glucose-induced HMC cell cycle arrest, cell hypertrophy, and glycolysis. UBR5 facilitated HMC hypertrophy and glycolysis by promoting the phosphorylation levels of AKT. Additionally, the promoting effect of glycolysis on cell hypertrophy were also elucidated. Further investigation into upstream regulators revealed that WTAP promoted m6A modification of UBR5 through the m6A reader IGF2BP1. Conclusions Our study unveils a novel mechanism involved in high glucose-induced cell hypertrophy, offering new insights into the understanding and treatment of early pathological mechanisms in diabetic nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims This study evaluates the contribution of common variants in Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) genes on type 1 diabetes (T1D), using a polygenic score (PGS) approach. Methods 485 children and youth diagnosed with T1D from at least 1 year and 271 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Personal information (i.e. age, sex, height, weight) were collected for each participant, and clinical information (i.e. age at diagnosis, disease duration, presence of autoantibodies and ketoacidosis at onset (DKA)) were also obtained for T1D subjects. Participants were genotyped using Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array. PGS based on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 MODY genes were developed. The association of this PGS with T1D susceptibility and clinical disease characteristics was assessed by regression analysis. Results A PGS including 335 SNPs in MODY genes discriminates T1D from HC (AUC = 60.1%, AIC = 787.6). This PGS was significantly higher in T1D compared to HC (p-value = 0.0004, pseudo-R2 = 2.85%). Moreover, regression analysis between PGS and T1D clinical characteristics showed higher PGS values in T1D subjects with zinc transporter 8 autoantibodies (ZnT8A) compared with T1D subjects without ZnT8A (p-value = 0.04). A similar trend was also observed for antibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), although the association did not reach statistical significance (p-value = 0.06). Conclusions Our study suggests that a polygenic approach based on MODY genes may discriminate T1D from HC and may contribute to patient stratification, helping to better understand T1D heterogeneity.",

From a total of 200 patients, half (n = 100) were treated with insulin (66% were females, age 52.1 ± 7.4-group A), the remaining 100 received oral treatment (74% females, age 63.3 ± 8.3-group B). For self-assessment of QoL, the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire was used. In group A, we found a negative influence of increased level of glycemia and occurrence of coexisting diseases in the somatic domain . In the psychological domain, frequent checkups showed a positive influence while circulatory failure produced negative results. For social domain, disobeying of recommended diet was strongly negative as well as increased levels of glycemia and coexisting disease for environmental domain. In group B, for somatic domain, correct values of glycemia and place of residence had positive influence. Incorrect values of BMI, WHR, and co-existing disease influenced the same domain negatively. In the psychological domain, a positive influence had place of residence but a negative BMI, ischemic heart disease, clinical complications. For environmental domain, a positive influence had correct values of glycemia but a negative BMI, ischemic heart disease and clinical complications. Finally, the social domain for group B was negatively influenced by BMI, ischemic heart disease, clinical complications, and lack of regular supervisions of glycemia level. A higher assessment of quality of life was found in the group of patients treated with oral hypoglycemic medicines in somatic and environmental domains, and in the group of patients treated with insulin in psychological domain.",

    "abstract": "Patients with diabetes caused by single-gene mutations generally exhibit an altered course of diabetes. Those with mutations of the glucokinase gene (GCK-MODY) show good metabolic control and low risk of cardiovascular complications despite paradoxically lowered high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. In order to investigate the matter, we analyzed the composition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and HDL subpopulations in such individuals. The LipoPrint(©) system (Quantimetrix, USA) based on non-denaturing, linear polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to separate and measure LDL and HDL subclasses in fresh-frozen serum samples from patients with mutations of glucokinase or HNF1A, type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and healthy controls. Fresh serum samples from a total of 37 monogenic diabetes patients (21 from GCK-MODY and 16 from HNF1A-MODY), 22 T1DM patients and 15 healthy individuals were measured in this study. Concentrations of the small, highly atherogenic LDL subpopulation were similar among the compared groups. Large HDL percentage was significantly higher in GCK-MODY than in control (p = 0.0003), T1DM (p = 0.0006) and HNF1A-MODY groups (p = 0.0246). Patients with GCK-MODY were characterized by significantly lower intermediate HDL levels than controls (p = 0.0003) and T1DM (p = 0.0005). Small, potentially atherogenic HDL content differed significantly with the GCK-MODY group showing concentrations of that subfraction from control (p = 0.0096), T1DM (p = 0.0193) and HNF1A-MODY (p = 0.0057) groups. Within-group heterogeneity suggested the existence of potential gene-gene or gene-environment interactions. GCK-MODY is characterized by a strongly protective profile of HDL cholesterol subpopulations. A degree of heterogeneity within the groups suggests the existence of interactions with other genetic or clinical factors.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the levels of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) can reduce glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and increase beta-cell apoptosis, two causes of islet dysfunction and progression to type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within miRNA genes can affect their expression. We sought to determine whether miRNAs, with a known role in beta-cell function, possess SNPs within the pre-miRNA structure which can affect their expression. Using published literature and dbSNP, we aimed to identify miRNAs with a role in beta-cell function that also possess SNPs within the region encoding its pre-miRNA. Following transfection of plasmids, encoding the pre-miRNA and each allele of the SNP, miRNA expression was measured. Two rare SNPs located within the pre-miRNA structure of two miRNA genes important to beta-cell function (miR-34a and miR-96) were identified. Transfection of INS-1 and MIN6 cells with plasmids encoding pre-miR-34a and the minor allele of rs72631823 resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) higher miR-34a expression, compared to cells transfected with plasmids encoding the corresponding major allele. Similarly, higher levels were also observed upon transfection of HeLa cells. Transfection of MIN6 cells with plasmids encoding pre-miR-96 and each allele of rs41274239 resulted in no significant differences in miR-96 expression. A rare SNP in pre-miR-34a is associated with increased levels of mature miR-34a. Given that small changes in miR-34a levels have been shown to cause increased levels of beta-cell apoptosis this finding may be of interest to studies looking at determining the effect of rare variants on type 2 diabetes susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between hormones involved in bone remodeling and glucose metabolism alterations in prediabetes.Individuals (n = 43) with NGT (BMI = 31.1 ± 1.1 kg/m2) and individuals (n = 79) with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) (BMI = 31.9 ± 1.2 kg/m2) including subjects with IFG, IGT, and IFG-IGT underwent OGTT and DXA. Osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and PTH levels were measured at fasting. Beta-cell function was calculated using C-peptide deconvolution. Dynamic indexes of insulin sensitivity were calculated from OGTT. A subgroup underwent to a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with 3-3H-glucose to estimate the endogenous glucose production (EGP) and insulin-mediated body glucose disposal (TGD/SSPI).OPN was higher in IGR compared to NGT (5.3 ± 0.5 vs. 3.3 ± 0.2 μg/mL; p = 0.008) and in isolated IGT compared to IFG and IFG-IGT (6.3 ± 0.5 vs. 4.5 ± 0.3 and 5.4 ± 0.5 μg/mL; p = 0.02). OCN was similar in IFG and NGT but lower in IGT and IFG-IGT compared to NGT (7.2 ± 0.3 and 5.4 ± 0.2 vs. 8.3 ± 0.3 ng/mL; p < 0.01). OPN was positively correlated with HbA1c, fasting and 2 h plasma glucose and PTH. OCN was negatively correlated with body fat, 2 h plasma glucose, insulin and positively correlated with Stumvoll index. OPG correlated with TGD/SSPI (r = - 0.29; p < 0.05), EGP, and hepatic insulin resistance index in IGR (r = 0.51, r = 0.43; p < 0.01). There was no correlation between PTH and insulin sensitivity or Beta-cell function parameters.In prediabetes, hormones known to be involved in bone remodeling may affect glucose metabolism before overt T2DM occurs with tissue-specific mechanisms.",

A 12-month, retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study, including DME patients with baseline visual acuity (VA) ≤ 0.1 logMAR (≥ 20/25 Snellen) and central subfield thickness (CST) > 250 µm with intra- and/or subretinal fluid seen on optical coherence tomography. A total of 249 eyes were included, of which 155 were treated and 94 were non-treated during follow-up. Most eyes maintained vision (VA gain or VA loss < 5 letters) at 12 months (treated: 58.1%; non-treated: 73.4%). In non-treated eyes with stable VA within the first 6 months, VA was maintained throughout the follow-up in most cases (86.3%). In non-treated eyes with VA loss ≥ 5 letters within 6 months (36.7%), further observation led to worse visual outcome than treatment (− 4.2 vs. − 7.8 letters, p = 0.013). In eyes in which treatment was initiated at baseline (n = 102), treatment with 8–12 anti-VEGF injections led to better visual outcome compared to treatment with less injections (− 0.3 ± 3.6 letters vs. − 3.8 ± 6.2 letters, p = 0.003). In a real-world setting, the majority of DME patients with very good VA maintained vision at 12 months, regardless of whether the DME was treated or not. This study supports close observation of eyes with DME and very good VA with consideration of treatment when a one line drop in vision is observed.",

This study compared outcomes of patients with DME switched directly to an FAc implant, versus indirectly via dexamethasone, after anti-VEGF therapy failure.This is a retrospective, single-center chart review. Patients were assigned to Group A (switched to FAc after anti-VEGF) or Group B (switched to dexamethasone and then to FAc after > 4 months). Charts were reviewed for best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataract development.Forty-nine eyes were included. BCVA increased and CMT decreased with anti-VEGF (both groups), and dexamethasone (Group B only), but regressed after stopping treatment. With FAc, BCVA increased rapidly and significantly: increases were maintained up to 36 months (P < 0.001), except at 18 and 9 months in Groups A and B, respectively. Significant CMT reductions (P < 0.001) were evident after 3 months and maintained up to 36 months in both groups. IOP increase > 21 mmHg occurred in 14 patients (nine in Group A, five in Group B): all were sufficiently treated with IOP-lowering drops. Nineteen phakic eyes (73.1%) developed cataract: seven underwent phaco-emulsification (two in Group A, five in Group B).Similar functional and anatomical improvements occurred in FAc-treated eyes, regardless of whether they first received dexamethasone or switched directly to FAc after anti-VEGF. Safety signals were consistent with corticosteroid class effects. Early switch to FAc could benefit patients who respond insufficiently to anti-VEGF.",

Methods An open-label single-arm, single-center, clinical investigation in children aged 7–18 years on MDI following a structured protocol: 2 days, HCL system assessment; 5 days, HCL system training (2-h sessions on 5 consecutive days with groups of 3–5 participants and families); 3 days, Manual Mode use of HCL system; 84 days, Auto Mode use of the HCL system, cumulating in 10 days from MDI to Auto Mode activation. Results A total of 30 children (age 10.24 ± 2.6 years) were enrolled in the study, and all completed the planned 84 days on Auto Mode. The participants used the sensor for a median of 92% of the time and spent a median of 89% in Auto Mode. The mean HbA1c decreased from 8.2 ± 1.4% (66 ± 15.3 mmol/mol) at baseline to 6.7 ± 0.5% (50 ± 5.5 mmol/mol) at the end of the study ( p = 0.017). Time in range (70–180 mg/dL) increased from 46.9 ± 18.5% at baseline to 75.6 ± 6.9% in Auto Mode ( p &lt; 0.001). This was achieved while spending 2.8% of the time below 70 mg/dL and without any severe hypoglycemia or DKA. Conclusion Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes on MDI therapy can successfully initiate the HCL system, using a concise structured 10-day protocol.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is now very prevalent in China. Due to the lower rate of controlled diabetes in China compared to that in developed countries, there is a higher incidence of serious cardiovascular complications, especially acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this study was to establish a potent risk predictive model in the economically disadvantaged northwest region of China, which could predict the probability of new-onset ACS in patients with T2DM.Of 456 patients with T2DM admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 2018 to January 2019 and included in this study, 270 had no ACS, while 186 had newly diagnosed ACS. Overall, 32 demographic characteristics and serum biomarkers of the study patients were analysed. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to select variables, while the multivariate logistic regression was used to establish the predictive model that was presented using a nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the discriminatory capacity of the model. A calibration plot and Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used for the calibration of the predictive model, while the decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate its clinical validity.After random sampling, 319 and 137 T2DM patients were included in the training and validation sets, respectively. The predictive model included age, body mass index, diabetes duration, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum uric acid, lipoprotein(a), hypertension history and alcohol drinking status as predictors. The AUC of the predictive model and that of the internal validation set was 0.830 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.786-0.874] and 0.827 (95% CI 0.756-0.899), respectively. The predictive model showed very good fitting degree, and DCA demonstrated a clinically effective predictive model.A potent risk predictive model was established, which is of great value for the secondary prevention of diabetes. Weight loss, lowering of SBP and blood uric acid levels and appropriate control for DBP may significantly reduce the risk of new-onset ACS in T2DM patients in Northwest China.",

This is associated with epidemiological data regarding the high incidence of heart failure (HF) in diabetic patients. To investigate the detrimental effects both of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, a lot of preclinical models were developed. However, the evidence of pathogenic and histological alterations of the so-called diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is still poorly understood in humans. Here, we provide a stringent literature analysis to investigate unique data regarding human DCM. This approach established that lipotoxic-related events might play a central role in the initiation and progression of human DCM. The major limitation in the acquisition of human data is due to the fact of heart specimen availability. Postmortem analysis revealed the end stage of the disease; thus, we need to gain knowledge on the pathogenic events from the early stages until cardiac fibrosis underlying the end-stage HF.",

Herein we review randomized trials and meta-analyses published during the last 20 years on the results of bariatric/metabolic surgery in obese patients with type 2 diabetes with the aim of highlighting the scientific evidence available. Several studies and RCTs in the last 20 years have showed outstanding results of bariatric/metabolic surgery on Type II diabetes and comorbidities in patients with either BMI &gt; 35 kg/m 2 or BMI &lt; 35 kg/m 2 . They have established that bariatric procedures are superior to non-surgical interventions for inducing weight loss and amelioration of type 2 diabetes, even in patients with a BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m 2 . The physiopatologic changes that improve glucose homeostasis after bariatric surgery remain unclear but glycemic control is improved after sleeve gastrectomy, duodenal-jejunal bypass, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, gastric banding, One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass, and biliopancreatic diversion. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the various gastrointestinal procedures may have different effects and mechanisms of action. Metabolic surgery will help integrate knowledge and multidisciplinary expertise to provide a combination of conservative and surgical treatments for Type II diabetes. These treatments must be considered as complementary options and not alternative strategies, with the same goal of controlling diabetes and achieving cure.",

    "abstract": "Children with chronic diseases were unable to receive their usual care during COVID-19 lockdown. We assessed the feasibility and impact of telehealth visits on the time-in-range (TIR) of paediatric individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). An observational multicentre real-life study. Patients scheduled for an in-clinic visit during the lockdown were offered to participate in a telehealth visit. Sociodemographic, clinical, continuous glucose monitor and pump data were recorded 2 weeks prior and 2 weeks after telehealth visit. The primary endpoint was change in relative-TIR, i.e. change in TIR divided by the percent of possible change (∆TIR/(100-TIRbefore)*100). The study group comprised 195 individuals with T1D (47.7% males), mean±SD age 14.6 ± 5.3 years, and diabetes duration 6.0 ± 4.6 years. Telehealth was accomplished with 121 patients and their parents (62.0%); 74 (38.0%) did not transfer complete data. Mean TIR was significantly higher for the two-week period after the telehealth visit than for the two-week period prior the visit (62.9 ± 16.0, p < 0.001 vs. 59.0 ± 17.2); the improvement in relative-TIR was 5.7±26.1%. Initial higher mean glucose level, lower TIR, less time spent at <54 mg/dl range, longer time spent at 180–250 mg/dl range, higher daily insulin dose, and single-parent household were associated with improved relative-TIR. Multiple regression logistic analysis demonstrated only initial lower TIR and single-parent household were significant, odds ratio: −0.506, (95%CI −0.99,−0.023), p=0.04 and 13.82, (95%CI 0.621, 27.016), p=0.04, respectively. Paediatric and young adult patients with T1D benefited from a telehealth visit during COVID-19. However, this modality is not yet suitable for a considerable proportion of patients.",

    "abstract": "Dysglycemia, including the three domains hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and increased glycemic variability (GV), is associated with high mortality among critically ill patients. However, this association differs by diabetes status, and reports in this regard are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between the three dysglycemia domains and mortality in critically ill patients by diabetes status and determined the contributing factors for dysglycemia.This retrospective study included 958 critically ill patients (admitted to the ICU) with or without DM. Dysglycemia was defined as abnormality of any of the three dimensions. We evaluated the effects of the three domains of glucose control on mortality using binary logistic regression and then adjusted for confounders. The associations between dysglycemia and other variables were investigated using cumulative logistic regression analysis.GV independently and similarly affected mortality in both groups after adjustment for confounders (DM: odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.08; p <0.001; non-DM: OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.11; p = 0.002). Hypoglycemia was strongly associated with ICU mortality among patients without DM (3.12; 1.76-5.53; p <0.001) and less so among those with DM (1.18; 0.49-2.83; p = 0.72). Hyperglycemia was non-significantly associated with mortality in both groups. However, the effects of dysglycemia seemed cumulative. The factors contributing to dysglycemia included disease severity, insulin treatment, glucocorticoid use, serum albumin level, total parenteral nutrition, duration of diabetes, elevated procalcitonin level, and need for mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy.The association between the three dimensions of dysglycemia and mortality varied by diabetes status. Dysglycemia in critical patients is associated with excess mortality; however, glucose management in patients should be specific to the patient's need considering the diabetes status and broader dimensions. The identified factors for dysglycemia could be used for risk assessment in glucose management requirement in critically ill patients, which may improve clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims The burden and health costs of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus continue to increase globally and prevention strategies in at-risk people need to be explored. Previous work, in both animal models and humans, supports the role of zinc in improving glucose homeostasis. We, therefore, aimed to test the effectiveness of zinc supplementation on glycaemic control in pre-diabetic adults. Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across 10 General Practitioner (GP) practices in NSW, Australia. The trial is known as Zinc in Preventing the Progression of pre-Diabetes (ZIPPeD)Study. Pre-diabetic (haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 5.7–6.4%, 39–46 mmol/mol) men and women ( N = 98) were all assigned to a free state government telephone health coaching service (New South Wales Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service) and then randomised to either daily 30 mg zinc gluconate or placebo. Blood tests were collected at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months for the primary outcomes (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG)); secondary outcomes included Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA 2) parameters, lipids, body weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure and pulse. Results The baseline-adjusted mean group difference at 6 months, expressed as treatment–placebo, (95% CI) was −0.02 (−0.14, 0.11, p = 0.78) for HbA1c and 0.17 (−0.07, 0.42; p = 0.17) for FBG, neither of which were statistically significant. There were also no significant differences between groups in any of the secondary outcomes. Zinc was well tolerated, and compliance was high (88%). Conclusion We believe our results are consistent with other Western clinical trial studies and do not support the use of supplemental zinc in populations with a Western diet. There may still be a role for supplemental zinc in the developing world where diets may be zinc deficient. Trial registration Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12618001120268.

Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis and meta-regression was to assess the impact of volume and intensity of aerobic exercise on glycaemic control. Methods Medline, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched up until 15 December 2020 for the terms “aerobic exercise AND glycaemic control”, “type 2 diabetes AND exercise”, and “exercise AND glycaemic control AND Type 2 diabetes AND randomised control trial”. We included (i) randomised control trials of ≥ 12 weeks, (ii) trials where participants had type 2 diabetes and were aged 18 or over, and (iii) the trial reported HbA1c concentrations pre- and post-intervention. Two reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Data are reported as standardised mean difference (SMD) and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Results A total of 5364 original titles were identified. Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Aerobic exercise reduced HbA1c versus control (SMD = 0.56 (95% CI 0.3–0.82), p &lt; 0.001). There were also significant reductions in BMI (SMD = 0.76 (95% CI 0.25–1.27), p &lt; 0.05). There was no dose–response relationship between improvement in HbA1c and the intensity and volume of the intervention ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions Twelve-week or longer aerobic exercise programmes improve glycaemic control and BMI in adults with type 2 diabetes. Longer or more intense interventions appear to confer no additional benefit on HbA1c.",

    "abstract": "Aims: A nationwide diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening program has been established in Denmark since 2013. We aimed to perform an evaluation of adherence to DR screenings and to examine whether non-adherence was correlated to DR progression. Methods: The population consisted of a register-based cohort, who participated in the screening program from 2013 to 2018. We analyzed age, gender, marital status, DR level (International Clinical DR severity scale, none, mild-, moderate-, severe non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR)), comorbidities and socioeconomic factors. The attendance pattern of patients was grouped as either timely (no delays > 33%), delayed (delays > 33%) or one-time attendance (unexplained). Results: We included 205,970 patients with 591,136 screenings. Rates of timely, delayed and one-time attendance were 53.0%, 35.5% and 11.5%, respectively. DR level at baseline was associated with delays (mild-, moderate-, severe NPDR and PDR) and one-time attendance (moderate-, severe NPDR and PDR) with relative risk ratios (RRR) of 1.68, 2.27, 3.14, 2.44 and 1.18, 2.07, 1.26, respectively (P < 0.05). Delays at previous screenings were associated with progression to severe NPDR or PDR (hazard ratio (HR) 2.27, 6.25 and 12.84 for 1, 2 and 3+ delays, respectively). Any given delay doubled the risk of progression (HR 2.28). Conclusions: In a national cohort of 205,970 patients, almost half of the patients attended DR screening later than scheduled or dropped out after first screening episode. This was, in particular, true for patients with any levels of DR at baseline. DR progression in patients with delayed attendance, increased with the number of missed appointments.",

Urinary metabolites were analyzed by targeted metabolome profiling and inflammatory cytokine IL-18 were measured by ELISA. Differentially expressed metabolites were selected and mediation analysis was carried out.Seven potential metabolite biomarkers (i.e., S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine, propionic acid, oxoadipic acid, leucine, isovaleric acid, isobutyric acid, and indole-3-carboxylic acid) were identified using the discovery and validation design. In the pooled analysis, propionic acid, oxoadipic acid, leucine, isovaleric acid, isobutyric acid, and indole-3-carboxylic acid were markedly and independently associated with DKD. The composite index of 7 potential metabolite biomarkers (CMI) mediated 32.99% of the significant association between the inflammatory IL-18 and DKD. Adding the metabolite biomarkers improved the discrimination of DKD.In T2D, several associated urinary metabolites were identified to improve the prediction of DKD. Whether interventions aimed at reducing CMI also reduce the risk of DKD especially in patients with high IL-18 needs further investigations.",

However, their influence on the retinal neurovascular unit remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the GLP-1 RA lixisenatide on diabetic retinopathy. Methods Vasculo- and neuroprotective effects were assessed in experimental diabetic retinopathy and high glucose-cultivated C. elegans, respectively. In STZ-diabetic Wistar rats, acellular capillaries and pericytes (quantitative retinal morphometry), neuroretinal function (mfERG), macroglia (GFAP western blot) and microglia (immunohistochemistry) quantification, methylglyoxal (LC–MS/MS) and retinal gene expressions (RNA-sequencing) were determined. The antioxidant properties of lixisenatide were tested in C. elegans. Results Lixisenatide had no effect on glucose metabolism. Lixisenatide preserved the retinal vasculature and neuroretinal function. The macro- and microglial activation was mitigated. Lixisenatide normalized some gene expression changes in diabetic animals to control levels. Ets2 was identified as a regulator of inflammatory genes. In C. elegans, lixisenatide showed the antioxidative property. Conclusions Our data suggest that lixisenatide has a protective effect on the diabetic retina, most likely due to a combination of neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of lixisenatide on the neurovascular unit.",

    "abstract": "Renal Denervation (RDN) is an interventional, endovascular procedure used for the management of hypertension. The procedure itself aims to ablate the renal sympathetic nerves and to interrupt the renal sympathetic nervous system overactivation, thus decreasing blood pressure (BP) levels and total sympathetic drive in the body. Recent favorable evidence for RDN resulted in the procedure being included in the recent European Guidelines for the management of Hypertension, while RDN is considered the third pillar, along with pharmacotherapy, for managing hypertension. Sympathetic overactivation, however, is associated with numerous other pathologies, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome and glycemic control, which are linked to adverse cardiovascular health and outcomes. Therefore, RDN, via ameliorating sympathetic response, could be also proven beneficial for maintaining an euglycemic status in patients with cardiovascular disease, alongside its BP-lowering effects. Several studies have aimed, over the years, to provide evidence regarding the pathophysiological effects of RDN in glucose homeostasis as well as investigate the potential clinical benefits of the procedure in glucose and insulin homeostasis. The purpose of this review is, thus, to analyze the pathophysiological links between the autonomous nervous system and glycemic control, as well as provide an overview of the available preclinical and clinical data regarding the effect of RDN in glycemic control.",

    "abstract": "Little information is available on the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) in regular clinical practice, prior to and at the point of initiating treatment with insulin. The INSTIGATE study provides a description of the clinical profile of the patient with DM2 who begins treatment with insulin in both primary and secondary care. A total of 224 patients who had been diagnosed with DM2, were not responding to oral treatment, and began receiving insulin were included in the INSTIGATE study in Spain. Demographic data were collected, as well as data on macro- and microvascular complications of diabetes and comorbidities, past medical history of diabetes and oral treatment administered, the clinical severity of diabetes (HbA1c concentration) and insulin treatment initiated. Mean age of the sample was 65.4 years and 56.7% were men. There were 87% of patients who had a diagnosis of at least one significant comorbidity, notably hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient profile for metabolic syndrome was met by 75.1% of the patients. There was a higher incidence of macrovascular complications (38.4%) than microvascular complications (16.1%). Prior to insulin initiation, the most recent mean HbA1c was 9.2%. The majority of patients had been treated in the last 12 months with sulfonylureas and/or metformin (69.6 and 57.6%). The most common treatment prior to insulinization was the co-administration of two oral antidiabetics (OADs) (37.5%). Patients with DM2 observed in the study presented with elevated mean HbA1c and body mass index levels, comorbidities and complications related to diabetes at the time of insulin initiation. Changes and adjustments in treatment from diagnosis of diabetes occur when HbA1c levels are far above those recommended by the IDF (International Diabetes Federation), a factor which could be contributing to the development of both macrovascular and microvascular complications in the patient profile described in the study.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance might be associated with an impaired ability of insulin to stimulate glucose oxidation and inhibit lipid oxidation. Insulin action is also inversely associated with TNF-α system and positively related to adiponectin. The aim of the present study was to analyze the associations between serum adiponectin, soluble TNF-α receptors concentrations and the whole-body insulin sensitivity, lipid and glucose oxidation, non-oxidative glucose metabolism (NOGM) and metabolic flexibility in lean and obese subjects. We examined 53 subjects: 25 lean (BMI < 25 kg × m−2) and 28 with overweight or obesity (BMI > 25 kg × m−2) with normal glucose tolerance. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and indirect calorimetry were performed. An increase in respiratory exchange ratio in response to insulin was used as a measure of metabolic flexibility. Obese subjects had lower insulin sensitivity, adiponectin and higher sTNFR1 (all P < 0.001) and sTNFR2 (P = 0.001). Insulin sensitivity was positively related to adiponectin (r = 0.49, P < 0.001) and negatively related to sTNFR1 (r = −0.40, P = 0.004) and sTNFR2 (r = −0.52, P < 0.001). Adiponectin was related to the rate of glucose (r = 0.47, P < 0.001) and lipid (r = −0.40, P = 0.003) oxidation during the clamp, NOGM (r = 0.41, P = 0.002) and metabolic flexibility (r = 0.36, P = 0.007). Serum sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were associated with the rate of glucose (r = −0.45, P = 0.001; r = −0.51, P < 0.001, respectively) and lipid (r = 0.52, P < 0.001; r = 0.46, P = 0.001, respectively) oxidation during hyperinsulinemia, NOGM (r = −0.31, P = 0.02; r = −0.43, P = 0.002, respectively) and metabolic flexibility (r = −0.47 and r = −0.51, respectively, both P < 0.001) in an opposite manner than adiponectin. Our data suggest that soluble TNF-α receptors and adiponectin have multiple effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in obesity.",

However, noticeable species variations in basal pancreatic uptake as well as uptake reduction degree due to selective beta cell ablation were observed.In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography studies of pancreas were performed using [177Lu]Lu-DO3A-VS-Cys40-Exendin4, in order to investigate the mechanism of uptake as well as the islet uptake contrast in mouse, rat, pig, and non-human primate. The autoradiography results were compared to the in vivo pancreatic uptake as assessed by [68Ga]Ga-DO3A-VS-Cys40-Exendin4 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in the same species. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo data formed the basis for calculating the theoretical in vivo contribution of each pancreatic compartment.[177Lu]Lu-DO3A-VS-Cys40-Exendin4 displayed the highest islet-to-exocrine pancreas ratio (IPR) in rat (IPR 45) followed by non-human primate and mouse at similar levels (IPR approximately 5) while pigs exhibited negligible IPR (1.1). In vivo pancreas uptake was mainly GLP-1R mediated in all species, but the magnitude of uptake under basal physiology varied significantly in decreasing order: non-human primate, mouse, pig, and rat. The theoretical calculation of islet contribution to the total pancreatic PET signal predicted the in vivo observation of differences in pancreatic uptake of [68Ga]Ga-DO3A-VS-Cys40-Exendin4.IPR as well as the exocrine GLP-1R density is the main determinants of the species variability in pancreatic uptake. Thus, the IPR in human is an important factor for assessing the potential of GLP-1R as an imaging biomarker for pancreatic beta cells.",

    "abstract": "Although the polymorphisms of PTPN22 and the variants of CTLA-4 have been reported to be the susceptibility genes, which increased risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), the results remained inconclusive. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between the polymorphisms of two genes and LADA. We performed a systematic review by identifying relevant studies and applied meta-analysis to pool gene effects. Data from ten studies published between 2001 and 2013 were pooled for two polymorphisms: rs2476601 in the PTPN22 gene and rs231775 in the CTLA-4 gene. Data extraction and assessments for risk of bias were independently performed by two reviewers. Fixed-effect model and random-effect model were used to pool the odds ratios; meanwhile, heterogeneity test, publication bias and sensitive analysis were explored. The minor T allele at rs2476601 and the minor G at rs231775 carried estimated relative risks (odds ratio) of 1.52 (95 % CI 1.29–1.79) and 1.39 (95 % CI 1.11–1.74), respectively. These alleles contributed to an absolute lowering of the risk of all LADA by 4.88 and 14.93 % when individuals do not carry these alleles. The estimated lambdas were 0.49 and 0.63, suggesting a codominant model of effects was most likely for two genes. In summary, our systematic review has demonstrated that PTPN22 rs2476601 and CTLA-4 rs231775 are potential risk factors for LADA. An updated meta-analysis is required when more studies are published to increase the power of these polymorphisms and LADA.",

    "abstract": "Insulin gene mutations, either dominant or recessive, can cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (INS/PNDM), which is defined as diabetes with onset within 6 months of birth [1, 2]. More rarely, INS dominant mutations give rise to diabetes that presents during infancy [3]. In most patients with heterozygous, dominant INS mutations, C-peptide is in the normal-low range at diabetes outset, but over time declines to undetectable levels as a consequence of ongoing apoptosis of the pancreatic beta cells. This process is triggered by the sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [2] induced by misfolding of mutant insulin trapped inside the beta cell. Thus, at least in principle, strategies aimed at relieving ER stress of beta cells may help to preserve endogenous insulin production from the normal allele.\r\n\r\nDuring the last 8 years, we identified a total of 16 cases with dominant INS gene mutations from 13 different Italian centers [2–4]. Thirteen were diagnosed with INS/PNDM (or with diabetes with onset during infancy) (2–4 and FB unpublished observations) before year 2010 and were treated with standard insulin therapy. Currently, all of them show undetectable C-peptide values. Instead, the three patients diagnosed with a dominant INS mutation after year 2010 were started on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) within a week after diagnosis. The three patients carried the novel INS mutation c.149A>G, p.Tyr50Cys (patient 1) and the already described c.94G>A p.Gly32Ser (patient 2) and c.314T>C p.Leu105Pro (patient 3). Diabetes onset was at 1 month of age for patient 1, 7 months for patient 2, and 5 months and a half for patient 3.\r\n\r\nIn patient 1, CSII was integrated with continuous (i.e., 24 h a day) glucose monitoring (CGM). CGM was set with alarms for hypoglycemia, with a 2-h automatic interruption of insulin delivery by the pump if glucose sensor detected a value ≤4.44 mmol/l (80 mg/dl), and for hyperglycemia, with increased insulin infusion over basal level (“correction factor”) of 0.025 U for every 5.55 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) above the glucose value of 8.33 mmol/l (150 mg/dl), in order to obtain the narrowest plasma glucose fluctuations possible.\r\n\r\nPatient 1 was discharged from the hospital after 1 month, patient 2 after 18 days, and patient 3 after 12 days. Informed consent was obtained from parents of patients. C-peptide was evaluated in patients 1 and 2 by two-site chemiluminescent immunometric assay. Assay employed for patient 1 (Liaison C-peptide, Diasorin, Saluggia, Italy) has a reported limit of detection of 0.01 ng/ml (0.003 nmol/l) and functional sensitivity of 0.03 ng/ml (0.01 nmol/l); for patient 2, the assay (Immulite 2000 C-Peptide, Siemens) has a reported limit of detection and functional sensitivity of 0.08 ng/ml (0.03 nmol/l). Blood samples for C-peptide determination were drawn after an overnight fast, without suspension of basal insulin infusion.\r\n\r\nAt follow-up as outpatients, no allergic reaction, lipo-atrophy, or -hypertrophy at the site of catheter insertion were observed; in addition, no episodes of ketosis or severe hypoglycemia requiring new hospitalization were reported for any patient.\r\n\r\nHbA1c is not a reliable method to evaluate metabolic control below the age of 6 months, because of the interfering effect of fetal hemoglobin: consequently, we do not report on patient 1’s glycated hemoglobin during the first semester of CSII. HbA1c values determined in patients 1 and 2 six months after diabetes onset were nevertheless comparable: 50 mmol/mol (6.7 %) for patient 1 (age 7 months) and 48 mmol/mol (6.5 %) for patient 2 (age 13 months) (Table 1). At follow-up, HbA1c values 12, 18, and 24 months after diabetes onset were declining in patient 1, while patient 2 showed a more irregular pattern (Table 1). Of note, insulin dose used for patient 2 was much lower for the entire period of CSII treatment (Table 1), suggesting that patient 2 may be more insulin-sensitive than patient 1. At strong variance with patients 1 and 2, patient 3 showed very high HbA1c from diabetes onset and never reached optimal metabolic control (Table 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\n\r\nInsulin dose and HbA1c in the three patients during 24-month period of treatment with CSII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterestingly, C-peptide was measurable at diabetes onset (1.04 ng/ml or 0.35 nmol/l), but became undetectable in patient 2 (CSII only) after 12 and 24 months from diabetes diagnosis, consistent with other reports showing this pattern in patients with INS proteotoxic mutations [2, 3]. In contrast, after the initial decrement recorded the first month after diabetes presentation, C-peptide of patient 1 (integrated system CSII/CGM) increased with a current value at 24 months of age of 0.26 nmol/l (Fig. 1). However, it has to be noticed that because of different sensitivities between C-peptide assays utilized, a direct comparison of these two patients cannot be easily made. Nevertheless, this was a surprising finding that has no easy explanation. From the clinical standpoint, the effect of the p.Tyr50Cys mutation seemed more pronounced than p.Gly32Ser, because patient 1 had an earlier diabetes presentation combined with a higher plasma glucose at onset (509 vs 293 mg/dl of patient 2). Interestingly, five patients previously described who bear INS/G23S mutation had diabetes onset at 6 months of age or beyond [1, 3]. On the other side of the token, patient 1 had no HbA1c fluctuations (Table 1), and it is tempting to speculate that the reduction in patient’s glycemic excursions obtained with CSII/CGM integrated system may have led to a substantial reduction in beta cell apoptosis consequent to the alleviation of endoplasmic reticulum crowding [5].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1\r\n\r\nC-peptide plasma level of patient 1 during the 24-month period of integrated CSII–CGM system. Numbers below each point are glucose values (mg/dl) at the time of blood drawing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results presented here indicate that CSII alone as well as sensor-augmented CSII is a feasible—and safe—therapeutic strategy for neonates or infants with diabetes, not only in the hospital setting, but at home. Moreover, CSII–CGM integrated system may be superior to CSII only, though we acknowledge that more cases must be studied to draw any robust conclusion. This may be probably obtained only through an international collaborative study, taking into consideration that PNDM is a rare condition (1:200,000 live births in countries with low rate of consanguineous marriages) [4].",

    "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are involved in the development and homeostasis of multiple organs and tissues. There has been a significant focus on understanding the role of BMPs in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our objective was to investigate the relationship between BMP6 and glucose homeostasis.Ob/ob mice were treated with BMP6 for 6 days and analyzed for insulin release, body weight, lipid parameters and glucose tolerance. Quantitative real-time PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation and glucose output assays were used to assess BMP6 effect on gluconeogenesis in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. Specificity of BMP6 receptors was characterized by the utilization of various receptor Fc fusion proteins in luciferase reporter gene and glucose output assays in INS1 and H4IIE cells.Treatment of ob/ob mice with BMP6 for 6 days resulted in a reduction of circulating glucose and lipid levels, followed by a significantly elevated plasma insulin level in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, BMP6 improved the glucose excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test, lowering the total glycemic response by 21%. In rat H4IIE hepatoma cells, BMP6 inhibited gluconeogenesis and glucose output via downregulation the PepCK expression. Moreover, BMP6 inhibited glucose production regardless of the presence of cAMP, antagonizing its glycogenolytic effect. BMP6 acted on pancreatic and liver cells utilizing Alk3, Alk6 and ActRIIA serine/threonine kinase receptors.Collectively, we demonstrate that BMP6 improves glycaemia in T2D mice and regulates glucose metabolism in hepatocytes representing an exciting prospect for future treatments of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "TIMI risk score and GRACE risk model are widely available and accepted scores for risk assessment in STEMI patients and include predictors of poor outcomes. CHA2DS2-VASc is a validated score for predicting embolic/stroke risk in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Its components contribute to the worse prognosis following myocardial infarction. The advantage of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in comparison with other risk scores is that it provides a comprehensive, fast, and simple method for physicians in risk evaluation that requires no calculators or computers. Therefore, we have set out to examine the prognostic significance of CHA2DS2-VASc score following STEMI in diabetic patients without AF. A total of 472 patients with diabetes mellitus and STEMI undergoing primary PCI were enrolled. Based on the estimated CHA2DS2-VASc score, the study population was divided into three groups: group 1 (N = 111) with a moderate CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or 3; group 2 (N = 257) with a high CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4 or 5; and group 3 (N = 104) with a very high CHA2DS2-VASc score of 6 or higher. In diabetic patients with STEMI, the median of CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4 (interquartile range 3–5). In-hospital mortality rate was similar across three groups. CHA2DS2-VASc score was not a risk factor of in-hospital mortality. ROC analysis revealed good diagnostic value of CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting long-term mortality (AUC 0.62 95 % CI 0.57–0.66 P = 0.0003) and stroke (AUC 0.75 95 % CI 0.71–0.79 P = 0.0003), but no value in predicting long-term myocardial infarction. CHA2DS2-VASc score was an independent predictor of 12-month mortality and stroke. One-point increment in CHA2DS2-VASc score was associated with an increase in the risk of 12-month death by 24 % and for 12-month stroke by 101 %. In diabetic patients with STEMI and no previous AF, median CHA2DS2-VASc score was high (4 points) and predicted 12-month death and stroke. However, it failed to predict in-hospital death and 12-month MI. CHA2DS2-VASc score had a similar discrimination performance in predicting 12-month mortality as TIMI risk score and a better discrimination performance in predicting 12-month stroke than TIMI risk score. Thus, it can serve as an additive tool in identifying high-risk patients that require aggressive management.",

    "abstract": "Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the most commonly used test when diagnosing peripheral vascular disease and is considered a marker for cardiovascular risk. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), a test associated with microvascular function, has in several studies shown better correlation with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) healing. Whether a low TcPO2 could be a marker for mortality in the high-risk population of DFU patients has not been evaluated before. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of TcPO2 in comparison with ABI and toe blood pressure (TBP) on 1-year mortality in type 2 diabetes patients with DFU.Type 2 diabetes patients aged ≤ 90 years, with one DFU who attended our multidisciplinary DFU-unit during year 2013-2015 and were screened with TcPO2, ABI and TBP were retrospectively evaluated. One-year mortality was assessed from the national death register in Sweden.A total of 236 patients (30% women) with a median age of 76 (69-82) years were evaluated in this study. Within 1 year, 14.8% of the patients died. TcPO2 < 25 mmHg was associated with a higher 1-year mortality compared with TcPO2 ≥ 25 mmHg (27.7 vs. 11.6%, p = 0.003). TBP and ABI did not significantly influence 1-year mortality. In a Cox regression analysis adjusted for confounders, TcPO2 was independently predicting 1-year mortality with a hazard ratio for TcPO2 < 25 mmHg of 2.8 (95% CI 1.34-5.91, p = 0.006).This study indicates that a low TcPO2 is an independent prognostic marker for 1-year mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes and DFU.",

Consecutive hospitalized DM patients were divided into well glycemic control group (HbA1c < 7.0%, group WGC, n = 100) and poor glycemic control group (HbA1c ≥ 7.0%, group PGC, n = 100), 100 hospitalized patients without DM served as control group (group C). All subjects underwent blood biochemistry test, treadmill exercise testing and 24-h Holter monitoring. HRR and HRV parameters were significantly lower in group WGC and PGC than in group C. Standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), standard deviation of all 5-min average NN intervals (SDANN), very low frequency (VLF) values were significantly lower in group PGC than in group WGC. HbA1c level was negatively correlated with HRR1, SDNN, SDANN, VLF, low frequency and high frequency. Logistic regression analysis showed that lower SDNN, SDANN and VLF values were risk factors for high HbA1c levels in DM patients after adjusting for gender, age and beta-blocker use in the model 1, and for gender, age, beta-blocker use, coronary artery disease and hypertension in the model 2. Present results indicate that sympathetic and vagal functional status are impaired independent of HbA1c level, while poor glycemic control is related to more significant neurocardiac dysfunction in DM patients.",

    "abstract": "Spain has been one of the worst affected countries by the COVID-19 pandemic. A very strict lockdown at home was imposed with a tough restriction of mobility. We aimed to evaluate the impact of this exceptional scenario on glucose profile of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) prone to hypoglycaemia using sensor-augmented pump (SAP).Patients with T1D prone to hypoglycaemia using SAP (640G Medtronic-Minimed®) for at least 6 months under the funding of a National Health Service were included in an observational, retrospective study. Data were collected in two periods: pre-lockdown (PL), February 23rd-March 7th and within lockdown (WL), April 1st to 14th 2020. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of time in target glucose range of 70-180 mg/dL (TIR). Additional glucometric data and total daily insulin were also analysed.Fifty-nine patients were included: 33 women, age 46.17 ± 13.0 years and disease duration of 30.2 ± 12.0 years. TIR 70-180 mg/dL (67.6 ± 11.8 vs. 69.8 ± 12.0%), time > 180 (28.1 ± 13.6 vs. 25.5 ± 13.1%), time > 250 (6.9 ± 6.1 vs. 5.1 ± 4.8) and estimated HbA1c (6.94 ± 0.8 vs. 6.75 ± 0.7%) significantly improved (PL vs. WL, respectively, p < 0.05). Time in hypoglycaemia, coefficient of variation, sensor usage and total daily insulin dose remained unchanged.Lockdown conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic may be managed successfully in terms of glycaemia control by population with DT1 prone to hypoglycaemia using SAP. The strict daily routine at home could probably explain the improvement in the time in glycemic target without increasing the time hypoglycaemia.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DATS on inhibition of high glucose-induced endothelial cell apoptosis and the underlying molecular events. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with DATS (100 μM) for 30 min and then cultured in high-glucose medium (HG, 33 mM) for 24 h for assessment of apoptosis, glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and gene expression using the terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL), flow cytometry, caspase-3 activity, ROS, SOD, and western blot assays as well as JC-1 and MitoTracker Red staining, respectively. DATS treatment significantly inhibited high glucose-induced HUVEC apoptosis by blockage of intracellular and mitochondrial ROS generation, maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and suppression of high glucose-induced dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression. Furthermore, DATS blockage of high glucose-induced mitochondrial fission and apoptosis was through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation-inhibited Drp1 expression in HUVECs. DATS demonstrated the ability to inhibit high glucose-induced HUVEC apoptosis via suppression of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in an AMPK-dependent fashion.",

Methods Ninety-one patients were included in this cross-sectional study and were divided into the NDM group (20 patients), DM group (25 patients), NPDR group (21 patients) and PDR group (25 patients). Basic information and samples of serum, aqueous fluid and vitreous fluid were collected before vitrectomy or intravitreal injection. The transcription and levels of ANRIL and other related factors were detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. Statistical Package for Social Sciences software was used for statistical analysis. Results ANRIL expression varied among different groups and body fluids. There was no difference in ANRIL expression between the NDM and DM groups, but the level of ANRIL was significantly lower in the DM group than in the NPDR and PDR group. In vitreous fluid, ANRIL expression was positively correlated with Ang II, p65 and VEGF expression in the PDR group. The expression of ANRIL in serum was not significantly correlated with age or the random blood sugar but was positively correlated with diabetic duration and HbAc1 level. Conclusions Levels of lncRNA-ANRIL are higher in DR patient and correlated with the progression of DR that may be used as an indicator to predict the development of DR. The activation of the RAS and the NF-κB pathway may be closely related to the upregulation of ANRIL. Clinical trial number ChiCTR1800017500. Registry Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.",

International Classification of Diseases codes (ICD-9 and ICD-10) and unique NHF codes were used to identify DM type 1 and type 2 patients, DR and treatment procedures including laser photocoagulation, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), anti-VEGF and steroid intravitreal injections. Results The overall registered prevalence of DR in the entire population of Poland was 0.81%. The mean prevalence of DR was 20.01% in the population with type 1 DM and 9.70% in the population with type 2 DM. In the study period, women represented 56.36% of all individuals registered with DR and 55.09% of all DM patients. In Poland, only 6.34% of all DM patients with DR received specific treatment with laser photocoagulation of the retina (82.32%), PPV (11.56%), anti-VEGF or steroid injections (5.15% and 0.97%, respectively). Cox regression hazard analysis showed that the risk of DR was associated with DM treatment only by GPs, female sex, coexisting systemic diseases and urban residence in both type 1 and type 2 DM. Conclusions A 5-year retrospective analysis reveals the mean prevalence of DR in the population with type 1 and type 2 DM in Poland was rather low.",

Methods Analyses use pooled data of the population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) studies ( n = 5312 observations aged ≥ 38 years without diabetes). Prediabetes was defined through either impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or elevated HbA1c according to thresholds of the American Diabetes Association. Explanatory variables were regressed on prediabetes using generalized estimating equations. Results Mean age was 58.4 years; 50% had prediabetes (33% had IFG, 16% IGT, and 26% elevated HbA1c, 10% fulfilled all three criteria). Age, obesity, hypertension, low education, unemployment, statutory health insurance, urban residence and physical inactivity were associated with prediabetes. Male sex was a stronger risk factor for IFG (OR = 2.5; 95%–CI: 2.2–2.9) than for IGT or elevated HbA1c, and being unemployed was a stronger risk factor for IGT (OR = 3.2 95%–CI: 2.6–4.0) than for IFG or elevated HbA1c. Conclusions The overlap of people with IFG, IGT and elevated HbA1c is small, and some factors are associated with only one criterion. Knowledge on sociodemographic and socioeconomic risk factors can be used to effectively target interventions to people at high risk for type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that poor glycemic control in diabetic individuals is associated with poor coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia outcomes and influences chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations. This study aimed to explore the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) and glycemic control on chest CT manifestations, acquired using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based quantitative evaluation system, and COVID-19 disease severity and to investigate the association between CT lesions and clinical outcome.A total of 126 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study. According to their clinical history of DM and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, the patients were divided into 3 groups: the non-DM group (Group 1); the well-controlled blood glucose (BG) group, with HbA1c < 7% (Group 2); and the poorly controlled BG group, with HbA1c ≥ 7% (Group 3). The chest CT images were analyzed with an AI-based quantitative evaluation system. Three main quantitative CT features representing the percentage of total lung lesion volume (PLV), percentage of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV) and percentage of consolidation volume (PCV) in bilateral lung fields were used to evaluate the severity of pneumonia lesions.Patients in Group 3 had the highest percentage of severe or critical illness, with 12 (32%) cases, followed by 6 (11%) and 7 (23%) cases in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.042). The composite endpoints, including death or using mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), were 3 (5%), 5 (16%) and 10 (26%) in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (p = 0.013). The PLV, PGV and PCV in bilateral lung fields were significantly different among the three groups (all p < 0.001): the median PLVs were 12.5% (Group 3), 3.8% (Group 2) and 2.4% (Group 1); the median PGVs were 10.2% (Group 3), 3.6% (Group 2) and 1.9% (Group 1); and the median PCVs were 1.8% (Group 3), 0.3% (Group 2) and 0.1% (Group 1). In the linear regression analyses, which were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities, HbA1c remained positively associated with PLV (β = 0.401, p < 0.001), PGV (β = 0.364, p = 0.001) and PCV (β = 0.472, p < 0.001); this relationship was also observed between fasting blood glucose (FBG) and the three CT quantitative parameters. In the logistic regression analyses, PLV [OR 1.067 (1.032, 1.103)], PGV [OR 1.076 (1.034, 1.120)] and PCV [OR 1.280 (1.110, 1.476)] levels were independent predictors of the composite endpoints, as well as the areas under the ROC (AUCs) for PLV [AUC 0.796 (0.691, 0.900)], PGV [AUC 0.783 (0.678, 0.889)] and PCV [AUC 0.816 (0.722, 0.911)]; the ORs were still significant for CT lesions after adjusting for age, sex and poorly controlled diabetes.Increased blood glucose level was correlated with the severity of lung involvement, as evidenced by certain chest CT parameters, and clinical prognosis in diabetic COVID-19 patients. There was a positive correlation between blood glucose level (both HbA1c and FBG) on admission and lung lesions. Moreover, the CT lesion severity by AI quantitative analysis was correlated with clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease in high-income countries. The strict control of glycemic oscillations is the principal therapeutic target, but this could be hard to achieve in uremic patients due to their unpredictable insulin sensitivity. Currently, the evaluation of the glycemic profile relies on serum markers (glycated hemoglobin HbA1c, glycated albumin, and fructosamine), capillary glucose blood control (self-monitoring of blood glucose), and interstitial glucose control (continue glucose monitoring). We conducted a systematic review of published articles on continue glucose monitoring in hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes, which included 12 major articles. Four studies found significant fluctuations in glucose levels during hemodialysis sessions. All studies reported a higher mean amplitude of glucose variations on the hemodialysis day. Three studies agreed that continue glucose monitoring is better than glycated hemoglobin in detecting these abnormalities. Moreover, continue glucose monitoring was more accurate and perceived as easier to use by patients and their caregivers. In patients with type 2 diabetes on hemodialysis, glucose levels show different variation patterns than the patients on hemodialysis without diabetes. Considering manageability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness, continue glucose monitoring could be the ideal diagnostic tool for the patient with diabetes on hemodialysis.",

    "abstract": "In previous reports, cardiotocographic (CTG) fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring has shown only limited benefits in decreasing adverse perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether an association exists between the recently reported ZigZag pattern (FHR baseline amplitude changes of > 25 bpm with a duration of 2-30 min) and asphyxia-related neonatal outcomes in GDM pregnancies.Intrapartal CTGs were recorded in a one-year cohort of 5150 singleton childbirths. The following CTG changes were evaluated: ZigZag pattern, saltatory pattern, late decelerations, episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia, reduced variability, and uterine tachysystole. The cohort was divided into three groups: women with GDM, women with normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and women with no OGTT performed. Umbilical artery (UA) blood gases, Apgar scores, neonatal respiratory distress, and neonatal encephalopathy were used as outcome variables.GDM was diagnosed in 624 (12.1%), OGTT was normal in 4115 (79.9%), and OGTT was not performed in 411 (8.0%) women. Hypoxia-related ZigZag patterns (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.64-2.34) and late decelerations (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.27-2.13) of FHR, as well as a greater risk of fetal asphyxia (UA pH < 7.10 and/or UA BE < -12.0 meq/L and/or Apgar scores < 7 at 5-min) (OR 6.64, 95% CI 1.84-12.03) were observed in those with GDM compared with those without GDM.GDM is associated with intrapartal ZigZag pattern and late decelerations, cord blood acidemia and low 5-min Apgar scores at birth indicating increased occurrence of fetal hypoxia in GDM pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Depression in type 2 diabetes may heavily affect the course of the disease. In this study, we investigated, among new cases with type 2 diabetes, the incidence and clinical predictors of depression and determined the extent to which depression constitutes a risk factor for acute and long-term diabetes complications and mortality.In this population-based retrospective cohort study, incident cases of type 2 diabetes without a prior history of depression were identified from the administrative databases of the Emilia-Romagna Region, Italy, between 2008 and 2017 and followed up until 2020. Logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of depression. Cox regression models were used to estimate the risk of acute complications over three years, and the risk of long-term complications and mortality over ten years.Incident cases with type 2 diabetes were 30,815, of whom 5146 (16.7%) developed depression. The predictors of depression onset were as follows: female sex, age > 65 years, living in rural areas and comorbid diseases. Depression in type 2 diabetes was associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing acute complications, 1.6-fold risk of developing long-term complications and 2.8-fold mortality risk.Our findings highlight that depression is associated with an increased risk for complications in type 2 diabetes and mortality and should not be neglected. Therefore, it is important to promote screening activities and introduce targeted and personalized treatment for depression in order to reduce the risk of poor short- and long-term outcomes of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in both men and women. Type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM1 and DM2) are well-known risk factors for CVD. In addition, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a female sex-specific risk factor for CVD. Here, we measure circulating concentrations of cardiac troponin T (cTNT), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) during pregnancy—a window of time often referred to as a cardiovascular stress test for women. Methods This study utilized data from 384 pregnant women: 64 with DM1, 16 with DM2, 35 with GDM and 269 euglycemic controls. Blood was predominantly sampled within a week before delivery. Cardiovascular biomarker concentrations were measured in serum using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Result Circulating cTnT levels were higher in women with DM1, DM2 and GDM as compared to controls, whereas NT-proBNP and GDF-15 levels were only increased in women with DM1. Glucose dysregulation, assessed by third trimester HbA1c levels, positively correlated with all three CVD biomarker levels, whereas pregestational body mass index correlated negatively with GDF-15. Conclusions Our results support the presence of myocardial affection in women with diabetic disorders during pregnancy. Although pregestational DM1 in this study was associated with the most adverse CVD biomarker profile, women with GDM displayed an adverse cTnT profile similar to what we found in women with pregestational DM2. This supports that women with GDM should be offered long-term intensified cardiovascular follow-up and lifestyle advice following delivery, similarly to the well-established CV follow-up of women with pregestational DM.",

Methods DIAGNODE-1: Samples were collected from 12 patients after 30 months who had received 3 injections of 4 μg GAD-alum into a lymph node with one-month interval. DIAGNODE Extension study: First in human, a fourth booster dose of autoantigen (GAD-alum) was given to 3 patients at 31.5 months, who were followed for another 12 months. C-peptide was measured during mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTTs). GADA, IA-2A, GADA subclasses, GAD 65 -induced cytokines, PBMCs proliferation and T cells markers were analyzed. Results After 30-month treatment, efficacy was still seen in 8/12 patients (good responders, GR). Partial remission (IDAA1c &lt; 9) had decreased compared to 15 months, but did not differ from baseline, and HbA1c remained stable. GAD 65 -specific immune responses induced by the treatment started to wane after 30 months, and most changes observed at 15 months were undetectable. GADA subclasses IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 were predominant in the GR along with IgG1. A fourth intra-lymphatic GAD-alum dose to three patients after 31.5 months gave no adverse events. In all three patients, C-peptide seemed to increase the first 6 months, and thereafter, C-peptide, HbA1c, insulin requirement and IDAA1c remained stable. Conclusion The effect of intra-lymphatic injections of GAD-alum had decreased after 30 months. Good responders showed a specific immune response. Administration of a fourth booster dose after 31.5 months was safe, and there was no decline in C-peptide observed during the 12-month follow-up.",

The present study addresses the comparison of individuals with diabetes and non-diabetic individuals in depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms, and health-related quality of life. Furthermore, mediator effect of BMI and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) on the association between diabetes, depression, and generalized anxiety was analyzed. Methods In this cross-sectional study, the three questionnaires PHQ-9, GAD-7, EQ-5D-5L were measured in a representative sample of the German population (N = 2386). In addition, the presence of diabetes and BMI were assessed via self-report. Results There were higher values in depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as lower score in HRQOL in individuals with diabetes compared to non-diabetic individuals. Obese individuals with diabetes showed the highest rates in depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety as well as lowest score in HRQOL. With regard to the mediator analyses, association between diabetes, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms is partially mediated by the BMI and fully mediated by the HRQOL. Conclusions In conclusion, individuals with diabetes have an increased risk in the development of depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as lower health-related quality of life. Future research and strategies in the public health policies among individuals with diabetes should take into account that the association between diabetes, depression, and anxiety is mediated by BMI and HRQOL.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim Recently, the relationship between diabetes and mental health has been widely studied. With the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), some researchers have been interested in exploring the association between glucose-related metrics and psychological aspects. These studies have primarily relied on self-report questionnaires which present some limitations. Therefore, the present multicenter study aims at testing potential associations between CGM metrics and affective processes derived from narratives about using a CGM sensor. Methods An exploratory correlational design was used. Fifty-eight adults with type 1 diabetes using CGM were enrolled and invited to complete an online survey, where they replied to an open-ended question regarding their personal experience with the CGM sensor. Texts derived from the answers were analyzed through Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, a widely used text analysis tool that can automatically identify and quantify linguistic patterns related to various psychological dimensions. Psycholinguistic measures were correlated with CGM metrics. Results Higher levels of sadness/depression correlated with lower %TIR ( r = − 339; p &lt; .01) and higher %TAR ( r = .342; p &lt; .01). Conclusions The study highlights the relationship between CGM metrics and psychological variables derived from patients' narratives. In particular, it is possible to hypothesize a positive role of %TIR in reducing depressive feelings in individuals with diabetes, as well as a negative role of depressive feelings in achieving desirable CGM outcomes. Additionally, there is a potential role of glycemic variability, particularly hyperglycemia, in the expression of depressive and sad feelings, which has been less studied compared to the effects of hypoglycemia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims This study aimed to investigate branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods Wild-type and db/db mice were fed BCAAs (5 or 10 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks, and hyperglycemia-exposed Müller cells were treated with BCAAs (2 or 5 mmol/L) for 24 and 48 h. BCAA levels were measured using MS/MS. Western blotting was performed to detect proteins. Flow cytometry, oxygen consumption rate, and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays were used to evaluate Müller cell viability. Each experiment was conducted at least thrice. Results BCAAs and branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) were increased in the retina and systemic tissues of diabetic mice, and these changes were further enhanced to approximately 2-fold by extra BCAAs compared to wild-type group. In vitro, BCAAs and BCKAs were induced in hyperglycemic Müller cells, and augmented by BCAA supplementation. The aberrant BCAA catabolism was accompanied by mTORC1 activation and subsequently induced TNF-ɑ, VEGFA, GS, and GFAP in retinas and Müller cells under diabetic conditions. The cell apoptosis rate increased by approximately 50%, and mitochondrial respiration was inhibited by hyperglycemia and BCAA in Müller cells. Additionally, mTORC1 signaling was activated by leucine in Müller cells. Knockdown of Sestrin2 or LeuRS significantly abolished the leucine-induced mTORC1 phosphorylation and protected Müller cell viability under diabetic conditions. Conclusions We found that BCAA catabolism is hindered in DR through mTORC1 activation. Leucine plays a key role in inducing mTORC1 by sensing Sestrin2 in Müller cells. Targeting Sestrin2 may ameliorate the toxic effects of BCAA accumulation on Müller cells in DR.",

    "abstract": "Islet equivalent (IE), the standard estimate of isolated islet volume, is an essential measure to determine the amount of transplanted islet tissue in the clinic and is used in research laboratories to normalize results, yet it is based on the false assumption that all islets are spherical. Here, we developed and tested a new easy-to-use method to quantify islet volume with greater accuracy. Isolated rat islets were dissociated into single cells, and the total cell number per islet was determined by using computer-assisted cytometry. Based on the cell number per islet, we created a regression model to convert islet diameter to cell number with a high R2 value (0.8) and good validity and reliability with the same model applicable to young and old rats and males or females. Conventional IE measurements overestimated the tissue volume of islets. To compare results obtained using IE or our new method, we compared Glut2 protein levels determined by Western Blot and proinsulin content via ELISA between small (diameter≤100 μm) and large (diameter≥200 μm) islets. When normalized by IE, large islets showed significantly lower Glut2 level and proinsulin content. However, when normalized by cell number, large and small islets had no difference in Glut2 levels, but large islets contained more proinsulin. In conclusion, normalizing islet volume by IE overestimated the tissue volume, which may lead to erroneous results. Normalizing by cell number is a more accurate method to quantify tissue amounts used in islet transplantation and research.",

    "abstract": "The extract of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort, SJW) and its component hyperforin (HPF) were previously shown to inhibit cytokine-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 and nuclear factor κB and prevent apoptosis in a cultured β-cell line. Objective of this study was to assess the protection exerted by SJW and HPF on isolated rat and human islets exposed to cytokines in vitro. Functional, ultrastructural, biomolecular and cell death evaluation studies were performed. In both rat and human islets, SJW and HPF counteracted cytokine-induced functional impairment and down-regulated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory target genes, such as iNOS, CXCL9, CXCL10, COX2. Cytokine-induced NO production from cultured islets, evaluated by nitrites measurement in the medium, was significantly reduced in the presence of the vegetal compounds. Noteworthy, the increase in apoptosis and necrosis following 48-h exposure to cytokines was fully prevented by SJW and partially by HPF. Ultrastructural morphometric analysis in human islets exposed to cytokines for 20 h showed that SJW or HPF avoided early β-cell damage (e.g., mitochondrial alterations and loss of insulin granules). In conclusion, SJW compounds protect rat and human islets against cytokine effects by counteracting key mechanisms of cytokine-mediated β-cell injury and represent promising pharmacological tools for prevention or limitation of β-cell dysfunction and loss in type 1 diabetes.",

In order to study retinopathy in this model, changes in retinal vasculature were analyzed by quantitative morphometry and related to retinal expression of 46 selected genes that were analyzed by microfluidic card PCR technology. At 3 months of age, obese animals had developed stable hyperglycemia (20.7 ± 1.3 mmol/L plasma glucose vs. 6.5 ± 0.1 mmol/L in lean). Hyperinsulinemia initially presented in obese rats at 2 months (10.5 ± 0.7 μg/L plasma insulin vs. 0.2 ± 0.04 μg/L in lean) and decreased at 3 months (3.9 ± 0.6 vs. 0.5 ± 0.09 μg/ml in lean). At 8 months of age, animals had developed microvascular complications. An increased number of acellular capillaries in obese (24 ± 5/mm(2)) versus lean (15 ± 4/mm(2)) and a decreased number of retinal pericytes in obese (2,270 ± 250/mm(2)) versus lean animals (1,620 ± 243/mm(2)) could be observed. VEGFa, MIF, and HIF-1α were the most abundantly expressed and inflammatory genes such as TNFα and IL-6 are the least abundantly expressed genes. None of these genes were differentially regulated. Surprisingly, specific growth factors such as bFGF (FGF2) and placental growth factor, and adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 were abundantly expressed and up-regulated in diabetic versus non-diabetic ZDF rats. In summary, we observed in type-2 diabetic ZDF rats retinopathy with retinal vasoregression along with a simultaneous up-regulation of specific growth factors such as bFGF and adhesion molecules, but only minor changes in key inflammatory genes.",

There are a number of new drug therapies purportedly targeting appetite; liraglutide, and bupropion/naltrexone, which are European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and lorcaserin and phentermine/topiramate, which have FDA approval only. Each of the six drugs, used singly or in combination, has distinct pharmacological, and presumably distinct behavioural, mechanisms of action, thus the potential to provide defined therapeutic options to personalise the management of obesity. Yet, with regard to pharmacotherapy for obesity, we are far from true personalised medicine. We review the limited mechanistic data with four mono and combination pharmacotherapies, to assess the potential for tailoring their use to target specific obesogenic behaviours. Potential treatment options are considered, but in the absence of adequate research in respect to effects of these drugs on eating behaviour, neural activity and psychological substrates that underlie poorly controlled eating, we are far from definitive therapeutic recommendations. Specific mechanistic studies and broader behavioural phenotyping, possibly in conjunction with pharmacogenetic research, are required to characterise responders for distinct pharmacotherapeutic options.",

    "abstract": "We performed an extended oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to investigate the relationship between early and late beta-cell response and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in families of South Asian origin and indigenous Dutch, burdened by T2D. Based on the OGTT, 22 individuals were normoglycemic, 12 glucose intolerant and 23 had T2D in the South Asian families; these numbers were 34, 12 and 18 in the Caucasian families, respectively. The OGTT had 11 blood samplings in 3.5 h for glucose, insulin and C-peptide measurements. Through early and late insulin secretion rate (ISR), the above basal glucose area-under-the-curve after glucose load (glucose disposal) and insulin sensitivity index (ISI), we obtained early and late disposition indices (DI). South Asians on average had lower ISI than Caucasians (3.8 ± 2.9 vs. 6.5 ± 4.7, respectively, P < 0.001), with rapid decline of their early and late DI between normal glucose tolerance versus impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance (late DI; P < 0.0001). Adjusted for ISI, age, gender and waist-to-hip ratio, early ISR was significantly associated with glucose disposal in South Asians (β = 0.55[0.186; 0.920]), but not in Caucasians (β = 0.09[-0.257; 0.441]). Similarly, early ISR was strongly associated with late ISR (β = 0.71[0.291; 1.123]; R (2) = 45.5 %) in South Asians, but not in Caucasians (β = 0.27[-0.035; 0.576]; R (2) = 17.4 %), with significant interaction between ethnicity and early ISR (β = 0.341[0.018; 0.664]). Ordinal regression analyses confirmed that all South Asian OGTT subgroups were homogenously resistant to insulin and solely predicted by early ISR (β = -0.782[-1.922; 0.359], β = -0.020[-0.037; -0.002], respectively), while in Caucasian families both ISI and early ISR were related to glucose tolerance state (β = -0.603[-1.105; -0.101], β = -0.066[-0.105; -0.027], respectively). In South Asian individuals, rapid beta-cell deterioration might occur under insulin resistant conditions. As their early insulin response correlates strongly with both glucose disposal and late insulin response, alterations in beta-cell dynamics may give an explanation to their extreme early onset of T2D, although larger prospective studies are required.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies have identified multiple variants that confer risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). However, established associations explain only a part of the heritability. Thus, even at the genome-wide association studies era, candidate gene approach should be still useful. Recent interventional studies against the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) showed reduction in new onset of DM, implying the system is involved in the onset. We substantiated the hypothesis that genetic variants of RAS have significant association with prevalence of DM. We enrolled to the study consecutive 782 subjects who had consulted our hospitals for mainly lifestyle related diseases. They consisted of 282 (36.1 %) diabetes cases. Genotypes were assayed with genomic DNA for conventional four genes of the RAS, i.e., angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion variant, angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T variant, angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1) A1166C variant, and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) C-344T variant. Association between the genetic variants of the RAS and prevalence of type 2 DM was tested. A significant association of DM and CYP11B2 genotype was obtained. There was no significant association between DM and ACE, AGT and AT1 variants. A multivariate logistic regression showed that age, gender, and CYP11B2 genotype were independent factors for association to diabetes, the DM risk of CC/CT to TT being 1.40 (95 % CI 1.04-1.90, p = 0.029). Thus, it is concluded that a genetic variant of the RAS should have a modest but significant impact on the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a recessively inherited monogenic form of diabetes coexisting with optic atrophy and neurodegenerative disorders with no currently recognized markers of disease progression. The aim of the study was to evaluate retinal parameters by using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in WFS patients after 2 years of follow-up and analysis of the parameters in relation to visual acuity. OCT parameters and visual acuity were measured in 12 WFS patients and 31 individuals with type 1 diabetes. Total thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), average retinal thickness and total retinal volume decreased in comparison with previous OCT examination. Significant decreases were noted for RNFL (average difference −17.92 µm 95% CI −30.74 to −0.10; p = 0.0157), macular average thickness (average difference −5.38 µm 95% CI −10.63 to −2.36; p = 0.0067) and total retinal volume (average difference −0.15 mm3 95% CI −0.30 to −0.07; p = 0.0070). Central thickness remained unchanged (average difference 1.5 µm 95% CI −7.61 to 10.61; p = 0.71). Visual acuity of WFS patients showed a strong negative correlation with diabetes duration (R = −0.82; p = 0.0010). After division of WFS patients into two groups (with low-vision and blind patients), all OCT parameters except for the RNFL value were lower in blind WFS patients. OCT measures structural parameters and can precede visual acuity loss. The OCT study in WFS patients should be performed longitudinally, and serial retinal examinations may be helpful as a potential end point for future clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Diabetic microvascular complications of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy may occur at hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1c) below the 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) diagnostic threshold. Our objective was to assess the validity of the HbA1c diagnostic cutpoint of 6.5% based upon published evidence of the prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy as markers of diabetes. Methods Data Sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and CINAHL from 1990-March 2019, grey literature sources. Study Selection All studies reported after 1990 (to ensure standardized HbA1c values) where HbA1c levels were presented in relation to prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy in subjects not known to have diabetes. Data Extraction Studies were screened independently, data abstracted, and risk of bias appraised. Data Synthesis Data were synthesized using HbA1c categories of &lt; 6.0% (&lt; 42 mmol/mol), 6.0–6.4% (42–47 mmol/mol) and ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy prevalence stratified by HbA1c categories. Random-effects multivariable meta-regression was conducted to identify predictors of retinopathy prevalence and sources of between-study heterogeneity. Results Pooled mean prevalence was: 4.0%(95% CI: 3.2–5.0%) for retinopathy, 10.5% (95% CI: 4.0–19.5%) for nephropathy, 2.5% (95% CI: 1.1–4.3%) for neuropathy. Mean prevalence when stratified for HbA1c &lt; 6.0%, 6.0–6.4% and ≥ 6.5% was: retinopathy: 3.4% (95% CI: 1.8–5.4%), 2.3% (95% CI: 1.6–3.2%) and 7.8%(95% CI: 5.7–10.3%); nephropathy: 7.1% (95% CI: 1.7–15.9%), 9.6% (95% CI: 0.8–26.4%) and 17.1% (95% CI: 1.0–46.9%); neuropathy: 2.1% (95% CI: 0.0–6.8%), 3.4% (95% CI: 0.0–11.6%) and 2.8% (95% CI: 0.0–12.8%). Multivariable meta-regression showed HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (OR: 4.05; 95% CI: 1.92–8.57%), age &gt; 55 (OR: 3.23; 95% CI 1.81–5.77), and African-American race (OR: 10.73; 95% CI: 4.34–26.55), to be associated with higher retinopathy prevalence. Marked heterogeneity in prevalence estimates was found across all meta-analyses (Cochran’s Q -statistic p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions The prevalence of nephropathy and moderate retinopathy was increased in subjects with HbA1c values ≥ 6.5% confirming the high specificity of this value for diagnosing T2DM; however, at HbA1c &lt; 6.5% retinopathy increased at age &gt; 55 years and, most strikingly, in African-Americans, suggesting there may be excess microvascular complication prevalence (particularly nephropathy) in individuals below the diabetes diagnostic threshold.",

Methods We conducted a search on Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies published before May 2020. According to the duration of follow-up, the subgroup analysis included four periods: 1–4, 12–18, 24–26, and 52 weeks. In the five trials included both 24–26 and 52 weeks of follow-up, we compared the efficacy by the placebo-subtracted difference and changes in SGLT2i groups. Results Fifteen trials including 7109 participants were analyzed. The combination of SGLT2i and insulin improved hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), daily insulin dose, body weight, and blood pressure, which varied greatly by different follow-ups. Compared with %HbA1c at 24–26 weeks, placebo-subtracted differences and changes in the SGLT2i groups slightly increased. SGLT2i plus insulin treatment showed no difference in the occurrence of urinary tract infections (UTIs), hypoglycemia, or severe hypoglycemia but increased the risk of genital tract infections (GTIs) in a duration-dependent manner. SGLT2i treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of ketone-related SAEs and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at 52 weeks. Conclusion SGLT2i as an add-on therapy to insulin improved glycemic control and body weight and decreased the required dose of insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. However, after 6 months the benefits of SGLT2is on glycemic control may weaken and the risks of GTIs and DKA increased.",

Epigenetic alterations could contribute to explaining the metabolic disturbances associated with foetal programming. Although the role of the FTO gene remains unclear, it affects metabolic phenotypes probably mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of this study was to assess whether placental DNA epigenetic modifications at FTO promoter-associated cysteine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites are correlated with GDM. A secondary aim was to evaluate the association between the placental FTO DNA methylation and the maternal metabolic traits in women with and without GDM. Methods Socio-demographic characteristics, clinical parameters at the third trimester of pregnancy, Mediterranean diet adherence, and physical activity were assessed in 33 GDM women and 27 controls. Clinical information about the newborns was registered at birth. The FTO rs9939609 (T &gt; A) was genotyped. Results No association between FTO DNA methylation and GDM was found. DNA methylation on the maternal side at the CpG1 was associated with maternal smoking in GDM ( p = 0.034), and DNA methylation at the CpG3 was correlated with smoking or former smoking in controls ( p = 0.023). A higher level of TGs was correlated with higher foetal placental DNA methylation at the CpG2 ( p = 0.036) in GDM. An inverse association between HDL-C and maternal placental DNA methylation at the CpG3 in controls ( p = 0.045) was found. An association between FTO rs9939609 and neonatal birthweight ( p = 0.033) was detected. Conclusions In the awareness that the obesity pathophysiology is complex, the study adds a piece to this intricate mosaic.",

We assessed the effects on mortality of hyperglycemia, disability, and multimorbidity at admission in internal medicine ward in patients aged ≥ 65 years. Methods Data were collected from an active register of 102 internal medicine and geriatric wards in Italy (RePoSi project). Patients were recruited during four index weeks of a year. Socio-demographic data, reason for hospitalization, diagnoses, treatment, severity and comorbidity indexes (Cumulative Illness rating Scale CIRS-SI and CIRS-CI), renal function, functional (Barthel Index), and cognitive status (Short Blessed Test) and mood disorders (Geriatric Depression Scale) were recorded. Mortality rates were assessed in hospital 3 and 12 months after discharge. Results Of the 4714 elderly patients hospitalized, 361 had a glycemia level ≥ 250 mg/dL at admission. Compared to subjects with lower glycemia level, patients with glycemia ≥ 250 mg/dL showed higher rates of male sex, smoke and class III obesity. These patients had a significantly lower Barthel Index ( p = 0.0249), higher CIRS-SI and CIRS-CI scores ( p = 0.0025 and p = 0.0013, respectively), and took more drugs. In-hospital mortality rate was 9.2% and 5.1% in subjects with glycemia ≥ 250 and &lt; 250 mg/dL, respectively ( p = 0.0010). Regression analysis showed a strong association between in-hospital death and glycemia ≥ 250 mg/dL (OR 2.07; [95% CI 1.34–3.19]), Barthel Index ≤ 40 (3.28[2.44–4.42]), CIRS-SI (1.87[1.27–2.77]), and male sex (1.54[1.16–2.03]). Conclusions The stronger predictors of in-hospital mortality for older patients admitted in general wards were glycemia level ≥ 250 mg/dL, Barthel Index ≤ 40, CIRS-SI, and male sex.",

    "abstract": "To reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), the disease decision model plays a vital role in supporting decision-making. Currently, there is no comprehensive summary and assessment of the existing decision models for T2DM. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the characteristics and capabilities of published decision models for T2DM. We also discuss which models are suitable for different study demands.Four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) were electronically searched for papers published from inception to August 2020. Search terms were: \"Diabetes-Mellitus, Type 2\", \"cost-utility\", \"quality-of-life\", and \"decision model\". Reference lists of the included studies were manually searched. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If there was insufficient information to include or exclude a study, then a full-text version was sought. The extracted information included basic information, study details, population characteristics, basic modeling methodologies, model structure, and data inputs for the included applications, model outcomes, model validation, and uncertainty.Fourteen unique decision models for T2DM were identified. Markov chains and risk equations were utilized by four and three models, respectively. Three models utilized both. Except for the Archimedes model, all other models (n = 13) implemented an annual cycle length. The time horizon of most models was flexible. Fourteen models had differences in the division of health states. Ten models emphasized macrovascular and microvascular complications. Six models included adverse events. Majority of the models (n = 11) were patient-level simulation models. Eleven models simulated annual changes in risk factors (body mass index, glycemia, HbA1c, blood pressure (systolic and/or diastolic), and lipids (total cholesterol and/or high-density lipoprotein)). All models reported the main data sources used to develop health states of complications. Most models (n = 11) could deal with the uncertainty of models, which were described in varying levels of detail in the primary studies. Eleven studies reported that one or more validation checks were performed.The existing decision models for T2DM are heterogeneous in terms of the level of detail in the classification of health states. Thus, more attention should be focused on balancing the desired level of complexity against the required level of transparency in the development of T2DM decision models.",

Loss of TIMP3, an Extracellular matrix-bound protein, is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy in human and mouse models, suggesting its pivotal role in renal diseases associated to diabetes. There is currently no specific therapy for diabetic nephropathy, and the ability to restore high TIMP3 activity specifically in the kidney may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the amelioration of renal injury under conditions in which its reduction is directly related to the disease. Increasing evidence shows that diabetic nephropathy is also regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including noncoding RNA. This review recapitulates the pathological, diagnostic and therapeutic potential roles of TIMP3 and the noncoding RNA (microRNA, long noncoding RNA) related to its expression, in the progression of diabetic nephropathy.",

Methods The subjects’ clinical parameters as well as their PREDIMED score and physical activity levels were recorded and compared at baseline, at 6 months and at the end of the intervention. Rs9939609 in FTO , rs17782313 near MC4R , rs326 in LPL , rs16147 in NPY , rs2943641 near IRS-1 were genotyped. Results The subjects carrying the A allele in FTO lost less weight ( p = 0.022) and had a lower BMI decrease from baseline to 12 months ( p -interaction = 0.047) than TT carriers. In addition, there was a significant PREDIMED score modification over time, according to genotypes for FTO rs9939609 ( p = 0.025) and NPY rs16147 ( p = 0.039), respectively. Conclusions These preliminary findings show a significant interaction between genetic variants and the PREDIMED score, suggesting that individuals carrying the FTO variant may lose less weight than non-carriers through diet/lifestyle intervention.",

One-step plasma glucose (PG) evaluation procedure was performed to assess gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in pregnancy as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria with International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) thresholds. The main outcome studied was large for gestational age neonates (LGA).A total of 2,709 participants were recruited with a mean age of 28 years (SD = 5.4) and a median gestational age (GA) of eight weeks (interquartile range [IQR] = 2). The prevalence of GDM in first trimester (T1) was 15.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 13.7-16.4). Previously undiagnosed DM was detected among 2.5% of the participants. Out of 2,285 live births with a median delivery GA of 38 weeks (IQR = 3), 7.0% were LGA neonates. The cumulative incidence of LGA neonates in women with GDM and DM was 11.1 and 15.5 per 100 women, respectively. The relative risk of having an LGA neonate among women with DM and GDM was 2.30 (95% CI = 1.23-4.28) and 1.80 (95% CI = 1.27-2.53), respectively. The attributable risk percentage of a LGA neonate for hyperglycaemia was 15.01%. T1 fasting PG was significantly correlated with both neonatal birth weight and birth weight centile.The proposed WHO criteria for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy are valid, even in T1, for predicting LGA neonates. The use of IADPSG threshold for Fasting PG, for risk assessment in early pregnancy in high-risk populations is recommended.",

Here, we investigated whether switching from a standard flash glucose monitoring system (FGM1) to a system equipped with hypo- and hyperglycemia alarms (FGM2) improves glycemic control and psychological outcomes in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D).Subjects with T1D and > 4% of time in hypoglycemia or > 40% of time in hyperglycemia were studied while wearing FGM1 (4 weeks) and after switching to FGM2 for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in time in range (TIR 70-180 mg/dl [3.9-10.0 mmol/L]) after 4 weeks of FGM2 use. Time below range (TBR), time above range (TAR), mean glucose, coefficient of variation (CV), sensor scans, treatment satisfaction, and hypoglycemia fear were secondary outcomes.We included 38 subjects aged 33.7 ± 12.6 year. During 4 weeks of FGM2 use, TIR increased from 52.8 to 57.0% (p = 0.001), TBR decreased from 6.2 to 3.4% (p < 0.0001) as did time < 54 mg/dl (from 1.4 to 0.3%, p < 0.0001) and CV (from 39.6% to 36.1%, p < 0.0001). These changes were confirmed after 8 weeks of FGM2 use. Treatment satisfaction improved and fear of hypoglycemia decreased. Subjects who had > 4% of time in hypoglycemia at baseline showed the greatest improvements in glucose control and treatment satisfaction.Switching from FGM1 to FGM2 improved TIR and treatment satisfaction and reduced fear of hypoglycemia. Participants who benefited most from switching from FGM1 to FGM2 were those prone to hypoglycemia.",

Data regarding Time in Range (TIR) (glucose levels: 70-180 mg/dl) 7 days prior and 7 days after a vaccination dose were collected in patients wearing CGM and data regarding insulin daily doses were also obtained for the insulin pump users.From a total of 135 patients eligible for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, 70 (51.9%) children (37 boys, 52.9%) were vaccinated with at least one dose. Seven patients received only one dose, whereas two children received a third booster shot. No statistically significant difference was observed in either TIR (64.19% post vs. 65.53% pre, p = 0.158) or total daily insulin dose (40.08 U/day post vs. 39.32 U/day pre, p = 0,282). Additionally, in ten patients on Hybrid Closed-Loop System the percentage of the automated insulin boluses given post-vaccination was not statistically significant different compared to the boluses given pre-vaccination (15.80% vs. 16.90%, p = 0,491).Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents with T1DM is safe and is not associated with immediate glucose imbalance.",

All patients also filled out a modified version of the periodontitis risk questionnaire by the American Association for Periodontology, from which the status of \"assumed periodontitis\" was deducted.

For all subjects, DM history and phenotype, major metabolic parameters (HbA1c, BMI, LDL and total cholesterol levels), general health risk factors, comorbidities and medication were collected.Clinically diagnosed (CPI > 2) and assumed periodontitis was detected in 60-67% of our patients. Male sex and oral health-related quality of life were associated with clinically diagnosed periodontitis. Male sex, age, smoking, dental hygiene, dental control and diabetes-related quality of life independently predicted assumed periodontitis.In DM patients, quality of life and lifestyle factors which systemically alter microvascular and immunological functions seem to predict periodontitis.

Methods A PubMed engine search was performed, using the terms “Telemedicine”, “Digital health”, “Telehealth”, “Telescreening”, “Artificial intelligence”, “Deep learning”, “Smartphone”, “Triage”, “Screening”, “Home-based”, “Monitoring”, “Ophthalmology”, “Diabetes”, “Diabetic Retinopathy”, “Retinal imaging”. Full-text English language studies from January 1, 2010, to February 1, 2022, and reference lists were considered for the conceptual framework of this review. Results Diabetes mellitus and its eye complications, including DR, are particularly well suited to digital technologies, providing an ideal model for telehealth initiatives and real-world applications. The current development in the adoption of telemedicine, artificial intelligence and remote monitoring as an alternative to or in addition to traditional forms of care will be discussed. Conclusions Advances in digital health have created an ecosystem ripe for telemedicine in the field of DR to thrive. Stakeholders and policymakers should adopt a participatory approach to ensure sustained implementation of these technologies after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The aim of this study was to determine whether undetected thyroid disease increases the risk of incident CVD and death in type 2 diabetes. Methods One thousand two hundred fifty participants with type 2 diabetes (mean age 65.3 years, 56.5% males, median diabetes duration 8.0 years) without known thyroid disease and not taking medications known to affect thyroid function were categorised, based on baseline serum free thyroxine (FT4) and thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations, as euthyroid, overt hypothyroid (increased TSH, low FT4), subclinical hypothyroid (increased TSH, normal FT4), overt thyrotoxic (decreased TSH, raised FT4) or subclinical thyrotoxic (decreased TSH, normal FT4). Incident myocardial infarction, incident stroke, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were ascertained during a mean 6.2–6.7 years of follow-up. Results Most participants with newly-detected thyroid dysfunction had subclinical hypothyroidism (77.2%) while overt/subclinical thyrotoxicosis was infrequent. Compared to participants with TSH 0.34–2.9 mU/L, those with TSH &gt; 5.1 mU/L were not at increased risk of incident myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence limits) 1.77 (0.71, 2.87)), incident stroke (1.66 (0.58, 4.78)), all-cause mortality (0.78 (0.44, 1.37)) or cardiovascular mortality (1.16 (0.38, 3.58)). Independent baseline associates of subclinical hypothyroidism included estimated glomerular filtration rate and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions Subclinical hypothyroidism was not independently associated with CVD events or mortality in community-dwelling people with type 2 diabetes despite its associations with CVD risk factors, questioning strategies to identify and/or treat mild thyroid dysfunction outside usual care.",

We examined blood pressure (BP) in adolescents and young adults with T1D from the Australasian Diabetes Data Network, a prospective clinical diabetes registry in Australia and New Zealand.This was a longitudinal study of prospectively collected registry data.T1D (duration ≥ 1 year) and age 16-25 years at last visit (2011-2020). Hypertension was defined as (on ≥ 3 occasions) systolic BP and/or diastolic BP > 95th percentile for age < 18 years, and systolic BP > 130 and/or diastolic BP > 80 mmHg for age ≥ 18 years. Multivariable Generalised Estimating Equations were used to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with BP in the hypertensive range across all visits.Data from 6338 young people (male 52.6%) attending 24 participating centres across 36,655 T1D healthcare visits were included; 2812 (44.4%) had BP recorded at last visit. Across all visits, 19.4% of youth aged < 18 years and 21.7% of those aged ≥ 18 years met criteria for hypertension. In both age groups, BP in the hypertensive range was associated with male sex, injection (vs. pump) therapy, higher HbA1c, and higher body mass index.There is a high proportion of adolescents and young adults reported with BP persistently in hypertensive ranges. Findings flag the additive contribution of hypertension to the well-established body of evidence indicating a need to review healthcare models for adolescents and young adults with T1D.",

We aimed to compare counterregulatory hormone and symptom responses to hypoglycaemia between people with type 1 diabetes, insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and controls without diabetes, using a standardised hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp. Materials: We included 47 people with type 1 diabetes, 15 with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, and 32 controls without diabetes. Controls were matched according to age and sex to the people with type 1 diabetes or with type 2 diabetes. All participants underwent a hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic-(5.2 ± 0.4 mmol/L)-hypoglycaemic-(2.8 ± 0.13 mmol/L)-clamp. Results: The glucagon response was lower in people with type 1 diabetes (9.4 ± 0.8 pmol/L, 8.0 [7.0–10.0]) compared to type 2 diabetes (23.7 ± 3.7 pmol/L, 18.0 [12.0–28.0], p < 0.001) and controls (30.6 ± 4.7, 25.5 [17.8–35.8] pmol/L, p < 0.001). The adrenaline response was lower in type 1 diabetes (1.7 ± 0.2, 1.6 [1.3–5.2] nmol/L) compared to type 2 diabetes (3.4 ± 0.7, 2.6 [1.3–5.2] nmol/L, p = 0.001) and controls (2.7 ± 0.4, 2.8 [1.4–3.9] nmol/L, p = 0.012). Growth hormone was lower in people with type 2 diabetes than in type 1 diabetes, at baseline (3.4 ± 1.6 vs 7.7 ± 1.3 mU/L, p = 0.042) and during hypoglycaemia (24.7 ± 7.1 vs 62.4 ± 5.8 mU/L, p = 0.001). People with 1 diabetes had lower overall symptom responses than people with type 2 diabetes (45.3 ± 2.7 vs 58.7 ± 6.4, p = 0.018), driven by a lower neuroglycopenic score (27.4 ± 1.8 vs 36.7 ± 4.2, p = 0.012). Conclusion: Acute counterregulatory hormone and symptom responses to experimental hypoglycaemia are lower in people with type 1 diabetes than in those with long-standing insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and controls.",

We investigated if diabetes mortality in Germany also obeys to the Gompertz law and how this information helps to communicate diabetes mortality more intuitively. Methods We analyzed all statutory health-insured persons in Germany in 2013 that were aged 30 years or older. Deaths in 2014 were recorded and given in 5-year age groups. We fitted weighted linear regression models (separately for females and males and for people with and without diabetes) and additionally computed the probability that a person with diabetes dies before a person of the same age and sex without diabetes, and the “diabetes age”, that is, the additional years of mortality risk added to an individual’s chronological age due to diabetes-related excess mortality. Results We included N = 47,365,120 individuals, 6,541,181 of them with diabetes. In 2014, 763,228 deaths were recorded, among them 288,515 with diabetes. Diabetes mortality followed nearly perfectly Gompertz distributions. The probability that a person with diabetes dies before a person without diabetes was 61.9% for females and 63.3% for males. Conclusions Diabetes mortality for females and males aged 30 years or older in Germany in 2014 followed the Gompertz law of mortality. The survival information of the population with diabetes during a large part of the lifespan can thus be reduced to the two parameters of the Gompertz distribution.",

Methods The study subjects were adult subjects (age ≥ 18 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) database of the USA in 2017–2018. Visceral fat area (VFA) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Subjects were divided into three groups according to VFA: low (VFA 0–60cm 2 ), medium (VFA 60–120 cm 2 ) and high (VFA ≥ 120 cm 2 ). Albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g. The statistical analysis software used is STATA 17.0. Results Data pertaining to 2965 participants (2706 without albuminuria) were included in the analysis. High VFA is an independent risk factor for albuminuria (OR 1.367, 95% CI 1.023–1.827). In the low-VFA group, there is no significant association between diabetes and albuminuria (OR 1.415, 95% CI 0.145–13.849). In the medium-VFA group, diabetes is an independent risk factor for albuminuria (OR 2.217, 95% CI 1.095–4.488). In the high-VFA group, diabetes is also an independent risk factor for albuminuria (OR 5.150, 95% CI 3.150–8.421). There is an additive interaction between high VFA (VFA ≥ 120 cm 2 ) and diabetes on the effect of albuminuria (RERI 3.757, 95% CI 0.927–6.587, p = 0.009), while no multiplication interaction (OR 1.881, 95% CI 0.997–1.023, p = 0.141). Conclusions High VFA may represent an independent risk factor for albuminuria. The amount of visceral fat may affect the effect of diabetes on albuminuria. The higher the visceral fat, the stronger the correlation between diabetes and albuminuria should be present. We suppose an additive interaction between VFA and diabetes on the effect of albuminuria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Evidence showed that SGLT2 inhibitors have greater protective effects against retinal diseases compared to other hypoglycemic agents. Thus, we explore the association between SGLT2 inhibitor usage and macular degeneration (MD) in Taiwanese patients with diabetes. Methods The National Health Insurance (NHI) program's claim data are released as the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). This database covers more than 99% of the residents in Taiwan. We included data on patients who were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM: 250, exclude 250.1x; ICD-10-CM: E11), with an age at diagnosis of over 20 years as our study population. Patients who received (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor) SGLT2i (ATC code: A10BK) over 90 days in 2016–2019 were defined as the SGLT2i cohort. Conversely, patients who did never received SGLT2i were defined as the non-SGLT2i cohort. The exclusion criteria were having MD before the index date, receiving SGLT2i within 1–89 days, and missing data on sex, age, or days of SGLT2i usage. Two cohorts were matched by 1:1 propensity score matching, which was based on age, sex, payroll bracket grade, urbanization, comorbidities, and medications. Results Compared to non-SGLT2i cohort, patients who received SGLT2i had a significantly lower risk of MD (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.66–0.75). Conclusions We found that SGLT2is has a strong protective effect against MD in patients with diabetes. SGLT2is may have benefits beyond glycemic control in patients with DR. However, additional clinical and experimental studies are required.",

Methods Prospective, interventional study. A total of 43 patients (63 eyes) were initially enrolled in the study. We performed swept source (SS) OCT and sectorial OCTA measurement to determine parafoveal VD at baseline and after six months of anti-VEGF treatment. In the locations with statistically significant differences in VD between baseline and month 6, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses to determine which, if any, of the baseline variables were associated with the observed changes. Results A total of 34 patients (48 eyes) were included in the final analysis. Mean VD decreased from baseline to month 6 (from 45.2 (± 3.5) to 44.6 (± 3.2) % in the SCP and from 50 (± 3.3) to 49 (± 3.9) % in the DCP). The only significant changes in VD were observed in the nasal sector of the deep capillary plexus, with a decrease of 2.9% ( p = 0.001). On univariate and multivariate analyses, the only variable significantly associated with changes in VD in the nasal sector after 6 months of treatment was baseline VD in the same sector. Conclusions Anti-VEGF therapy has a small impact on VD values over time. These variations observed after treatment seems to be related to changes over areas of vascular anomalies and displaced vessels adjacent to cystic areas, with no significant changes over ischemic areas. No correlation was observed between this trend and other clinical baseline features.",

The aim of this study was to examine their density, distribution, transcription-factor expression, and mitotic activity in young non-diabetic subjects. Methods Multispectral imaging was used to examine PDX1, ARX, Ki67, insulin and glucagon in extra-islet endocrine cells in pancreatic tissue from organ donors aged 1–25 years. Results Extra-islet insulin- or glucagon-positive cells were frequent in all donors (median 17.3 and 22.9 cells/mm 2 respectively), with an insulin:glucagon cell ratio of 0.9. The density was similar regardless of age. PDX1 localized mainly to insulin-, and ARX mainly to glucagon-positive cells but, interestingly, many of the cells were negative for both transcription factors. Double-hormone-positive cells were rare but found in all age groups, as were insulin-positive cells expressing ARX and glucagon-positive cells expressing PDX1. Extra-islet endocrine cells with Ki67 expression were present but rare (0–2%) in all age groups. Conclusions Extra-islet endocrine cells are more frequent than islets. The preserved extra-islet cell density during pancreas volume-expansion from childhood- to adulthood indicates that new cells are formed, possibly from replication as cells with mitotic activity were discovered. The lack of transcription-factor expression in many cells indicates that they are immature, newly formed or plastic. This, together with the mitotic activity, suggests that these cells could play an important role in the expansion of beta-cell mass in situations of increasing demand, or in the turnover of the endocrine cell population.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The primary cause of the pandemic scale of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the excessive and/or abnormal accumulation of adiposity resulting from a chronic positive energy balance. Any form of weight loss dramatically affects the natural history of T2D, favoring prevention, treatment, and even remission in the case of significant weight loss. However, weight regain, which is often accompanied by the recurrence or worsening of obesity complications such as T2D, is an inevitable biological phenomenon that is an integral part of the pathophysiology of obesity. This can occur not only after weight loss, but also during obesity treatment if it is not effective enough to counteract the physiological responses aimed at restoring adiposity to its pre-weight-loss equilibrium state. Over the past few years, many controlled and randomized studies have suggested a superior efficacy of bariatric surgery compared to conventional therapy in terms of weight loss, glycemic control, and rates of T2D remission. Recently, the therapeutic armamentarium in the field of diabetology has been enriched with new antihyperglycemic drugs with considerable efficacy in reducing body weight, which could play a pathogenetic role in the remission of T2D, not through the classical incretin effect, but by improving adipose tissue functions. All these concepts are discussed in this position statement, which aims to deepen the pathogenetic links between obesity and T2D, shift the paradigm from a “simple” interaction between insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, and evaluate the efficacy of different therapeutic interventions to improve T2D management and induce diabetes remission whenever still possible.",

    "abstract": "Monogenic diabetes caused by mutations in the glucokinase gene (GCK-MODY) is usually characterized by a mild clinical phenotype. The clinical course of diabetes may be, however, highly variable. The authors present a child with diabetes manifesting with ketoacidosis during the neonatal period, born in a large family with ten members bearing a heterozygous p.Gly223Ser mutation in GCK. DNA sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were used to confirm GCK mutation and exclude other de novo mutations in other known genes associated with monogenic diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was used to assess daily glycemic profiles. At the onset of diabetes the child had hyperglycemia 765 mg/dl with pH 7.09. Her glycated hemoglobin level was 8.6% (70.5 mmol/mol). The C-peptide level was below normal range (<0.5 pmol/ml) at onset, and the three- and 6-month follow-up examinations. Current evaluation at age 3 still showed unsatisfactory metabolic control with HbA1c level equal to 8.1% (65.0 mmol/mol). CGM data showed glucose concentrations profile similar to poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. The patient was confirmed to be heterozygous for the p.Gly223Ser mutation and did not show any point mutations or deletions within other monogenic diabetes genes. Other family members with p.Gly223Ser mutation had retained C-peptide levels and mild diabetes manageable with diet (five individuals), oral hypoglycemizing agents (five patients), or insulin (one patient). This mutation was absent within all healthy family members. Heterozygous mutations of the GCK gene may result in neonatal diabetes similar to type 1 diabetes, the cause of such phenotype variety is still unknown. The possibility of other additional, unknown mutations seems to be the most likely explanation for the unusual presentation of GCK-MODY.",

The Prospective, Randomized Trial on Intensive SMBG Management Added Value in Non-insulin-Treated T2DM Patients (PRISMA) is a 12-month, prospective, multicenter, open, parallel group, randomized, and controlled trial to evaluate the added value of an intensive, structured SMBG regimen in T2DM patients treated with oral agents and/or diet. One thousand patients (500 per arm) will be enrolled at 39 clinical sites in Italy. Eligible patients will be randomized to the intensive structured monitoring (ISM) group or the active control (AC) group, with a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) target of <7.0%. Intervention will comprise (1) structured SMBG (4-point daily glucose profiles on 3 days per week [ISM]; discretionary, unstructured SMBG [AC]); (2) comprehensive patient education (both groups); and (3) clinician's adjustment of diabetes medications using an algorithm targeting SMBG levels, HbA1c and hypoglycemia (ISM) or HbA1c and hypoglycemia (AC). The intervention and trial design build upon previous research by emphasizing appropriate and collaborative use of SMBG by both patients and physicians. Utilization of per protocol and intent-to-treat analyses facilitates assessment of the intervention. Inclusion of multiple dependent variables allows us to assess the broader impact of the intervention, including changes in patient and physician attitudes and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The quality and quantity of food intake affect body weight, but little is known about the genetics of such human dietary intake patterns in relation to the genetics of BMI. We aimed to estimate the heritability of dietary intake patterns and genetic correlation with BMI in participants of the Erasmus Rucphen Family study. The study included 1,690 individuals (42 % men; age range, 19–92), of whom 41.4 % were overweight and 15.9 % were obese. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess the number of days (0–7) on which participants consumed vegetables, fruit, fruit juice, fish, unhealthy snacks, fastfood, and soft drinks. Principal component analysis was applied to examine the correlations between the questionnaire items and to generate dietary intake pattern scores. Heritability and the shared genetic and shared non-genetic (environmental) correlations were estimated using the family structure of the cohort. Principal component analysis suggested that the questionnaire items could be grouped in a healthy and unhealthy dietary intake pattern, explaining 22 and 18 % of the phenotypic variance, respectively. The dietary intake patterns had a heritability of 0.32 for the healthy and 0.27 for the unhealthy pattern. Genetic correlations between the dietary intake patterns and BMI were not significant, but we found a significant environmental correlation between the unhealthy dietary intake pattern and BMI. Specific dietary intake patterns are associated with the risk of obesity and are heritable traits. The genetic factors that determine specific dietary intake patterns do not significantly overlap with the genetic factors that determine BMI.",

    "abstract": "To compare gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk among two ethnic minority groups, with high type-2 diabetes (T2DM) prevalence, as compared to the Jewish population majority group.A historical cohort study was conducted using clinical data collected between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011. The study sample included 20-45-year-old women; 2938 Ethiopian, 5849 Arab and 5156 non-Ethiopian Jewish women. GDM was defined according to the two-step strategy: step 1: glucose ≥ 140 mg/dl and step 2: using Coustan and Carpenter's diagnostic criteria. GDM risk was tested in a multivariable model, adjusted for age, parity and pre-gestational values of the metabolic syndrome components.Mean body mass index (BMI) values and morbid obesity rates were lowest among Ethiopian women and highest among Arab women. The prevalence of pre-gestational diabetes was significantly higher among Ethiopian (2.7%) and Arab (4.1%) women than among non-Ethiopian Jewish women (1.6%), and GDM screening rates were relatively high (85.5%, 87.2% and 83%, respectively). The proportion of pregnancies complicated with GDM was higher among Ethiopian women (4.3%) but not significantly different between Arab (2.9%) and non-Ethiopian Jewish (2.2%) women. In multivariable analysis, GDM was associated with Ethiopian ancestry (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.60-4.08), adjusted for age, BMI, plasma triglyceride level and parity. Arab ethnicity was not significantly associated with GDM risk in multivariable analysis.Both Ethiopian and Arab minority ethnicities have a higher risk of T2DM in comparison with other Israeli women, but only Ethiopian origin is an independent risk factor for GDM while Arab ethnicity is not.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose To characterize the progression in retinopathy severity of different phenotypes of mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Design and methods Patients with type 2 diabetes and mild NPDR (ETDRS 20 or 35) were followed in a 5-year longitudinal study. Examinations, including color fundus photography (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT and OCTA), were performed at baseline, 6 months and then annually. Phenotype classification was performed based on microaneurysm turnover (MAT, on CFP) and central retinal thickness (CRT, on OCT). Phenotype A is characterized by low MAT (&lt; 6) and normal CRT; Phenotype B by low MAT (&lt; 6) and increased CRT; and Phenotype C by higher MAT (≥ 6) with or without increased CRT. ETDRS grading of seven fields CFP was performed at the initial and last visits. Results Analysis of ETDRS grade step changes showed significant differences in diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression between the different phenotypes ( p &lt; 0.001). Of the 66 participants with phenotype A only 2 eyes (3%) presented 2-or-more-step worsening. None of the 50 participants characterized as phenotype B developed 2-step worsening, whereas 13 eyes (23.2%) characterized as phenotype C had 2-or-more-steps worsening. Phenotype C presents the higher risk for 2-or-more step worsening (OR: 15.94 95% CI: 3.45–73.71; p &lt; 0.001) and higher sensitivity, correctly identifying 86.7% of cases at risk (AUC: 0.84 95% CI: 0.72–0.96; p &lt; 0.001). Diabetic retinopathy severity progression was associated with HbA 1c ( p = 0.019), LDL levels ( p = 0.043), and ocular factors as MAT ( p = 0.010), MA formation rate ( p = 0.014) and MA disappearance rate ( p = 0.005). Capillary closure at 5-year follow-up, identified by lower vessel density (VD) on OCTA, was also associated with diabetic DR severity progression ( p = 0.035). Conclusions Different DR phenotypes in type 2 diabetes show different risks of retinopathy progression. Phenotype C is associated with increased HbA 1c values and presents a higher risk of a 2-or-more-step worsening of the ETDRS severity score.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims We aimed to determine the patient and screening-level factors that are associated with non-attendance in the Irish National Diabetic Retinal screening programme (Diabetic RetinaScreen). To accomplish this, we modelled a selection of predictors derived from the historical screening records of patients with diabetes. Methods In this cohort study, appointment data from the national diabetic retinopathy screening programme (RetinaScreen) were extracted and augmented using publicly available meteorological and geospatial data. A total of 653,969 appointments from 158,655 patients were included for analysis. Mixed-effects models (univariable and multivariable) were used to estimate the influence of several variables on non-attendance to screening appointments. Results All variables considered for analysis were statistically significant. Variables of note, with meaningful effect, were age (OR: 1.23 per decade away from 70; 95% CI: [1.22–1.24]), type 2 diabetes (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: [1.06–1.14]) and socio-economic deprivation (OR: 1.12; 95% CI: [1.09–1.16]). A majority (52%) of missed appointments were from patients who had missed three or more appointments. Conclusions This study is the first to outline factors that are associated with non-attendance within the Irish national diabetic retinopathy screening service. In particular, when corrected for age and other factors, patients with type 2 diabetes had higher rates of non-attendance. Additionally, this is the first study of any diabetic screening programme to demonstrate that weather may influence attendance. This research provides unique insight to guide the implementation of an optimal and cost-effective intervention strategy to improve attendance.",

Recursive partitioning (RECPAM) analysis was used to identify distinct and homogeneous subgroups of women at different PPD risk.From a sample of 2,736 women, OGTT was performed in 941 (34.4%) women, of whom 217 (23.0%) developed PPD. Insulin-treated women having family history of diabetes represented the subgroup with the highest PPD risk (OR 5.57, 95% CI 3.60-8.63) compared to the reference class (women on diet with pre-pregnancy BMI < = 28.1 kg/m2). Insulin-treated women without family diabetes history and women on diet with pre-pregnancy BMI > 28.1 kg/m2 showed a two-fold PPD risk. Previous GDM and socioeconomic status represent additional predictors. Fasting more than post-prandial glycemia plays a predictive role, with values of 81-87 mg/dl (4.5-4.8 mmol/l) (lower than the current diagnostic GDM threshold) being associated with PPD risk.Increasing compliance to postpartum OGTT to prevent/delay PPD is a priority. Easily available characteristics identify subgroups of women more likely to benefit from preventive strategies. Fasting BG values during pregnancy lower than those usually considered deserve attention.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic β-cell apoptosis may be involved in the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus, although its mechanism remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that macrophage-derived interferon (IFN) β induced X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1 (XAF1) expression in β-cells and accelerated β-cell apoptosis in vitro. Here, we explored the effects of XAF1 on β-cell function and progression of diabetes in vivo.Pancreatic β-cell-selective XAF1 overexpressing (Xaf1 Tg) mice were generated. Xaf1 Tg mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were fed either a normal diet or a 40% or 60% high-fat diet (HFD). The effects of β-cell XAF1 on β-cell apoptosis and exacerbation of diabetes were investigated.Palmitic acid induced IFNβ expression in macrophages, and HFD intake promoted macrophage infiltration in pancreatic islets, both of which cooperatively upregulated XAF1 expression in mouse islets. Furthermore, HFD-fed Xaf1 Tg mice demonstrated increased β-cell apoptosis, lowered insulin expression, and impaired glucose tolerance compared with WT mice fed the same diet. These effects were more pronounced in the 60%HFD group than in the 40%HFD group.Pancreatic β-cell XAF1 expression was enhanced via HFD-induced, macrophage-derived IFNβ, which promoted β-cell apoptosis and led to a reduction in insulin secretion and progression of diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate an association between pancreatic β-cell XAF1 overexpression and exacerbation of diabetes, thus providing insight into the mechanism of β-cell mass reduction in diabetes.",

A retrospective real-world analysis was conducted combining hospital admission and prehospital emergency service data to compare incidences of hypoglycemia requiring emergency medical support (EMS) involvement or hospital admission and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) before and after the start of isCGM. Data were collected from January 2015 to April 2020. Primary outcome was the rate of hypoglycemia requiring EMS involvement or hospital admission and DKA events.

The isCGM used in the study did not contain alarm functions.Altogether 220 hypoglycemic events were identified during the study period. Incidence rate of hypoglycemic events decreased after the start of isCGM (72 events, incidence rate 50 events/1000 person-years) compared with the time before the start (148 events, incidence rate 76 events/1000 person-years) (p = 0.043). The incidence rate of DKA decreased after the start of isCGM compared with time before isCGM use (4 and 15 events/1000 person-years, respectively; p = 0.002). The change in mean HbA1c was - 0.28% (- 3.1 mmol/mol) between baseline and the last HbA1c measurement (p < 0.001).In addition to lowering HbA1c in type 1 diabetes patients, isCGM is also effective in preventing acute diabetes-related complications such as hypoglycemia requiring EMS involvement or hospital admission and DKA.",

It has been a concern that this may lead to early worsening of diabetic retinopathy (DR) due to a rapid decline in HbA1c. In this study, we evaluated the risk of short and long-term DR development and need for ocular intervention in an entire nation of individuals with T2D undergoing bariatric surgery. The study comprised a national, register-based cohort of individuals with T2D screened for DR. Cases were matched by age, sex and DR level at the date of surgery (index date) with non-bariatric controls. We extracted information on DR levels, in- and outpatient treatments, pharmaceutical prescriptions and laboratory values. We evaluated worsening of DR (incident and progressive DR) at follow-up (6 and 36 months). Amongst 238,967 individuals with T2D, who attended diabetic eye screening, we identified 553 that underwent bariatric surgery (0.2%) and 2677 non-bariatric controls. Median age was 49 years, and 63% were female. Cases had more comorbidities, lower HbA1c as well as more frequent use of glucose-lowering and antihypertensive medication than controls at index date. In a fully adjusted logistic regression model, the risk of DR worsening for cases was not significantly different compared to controls, neither short-term (OR 0.41 [CI 95% 0.13; 1.33], p = 0.14) nor long-term (OR 0.64 [CI 95% 0.33; 1.24], p = 0.18). In this nationwide study, bariatric surgery did not associate with increased risk of short- or long-term DR worsening.",

This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. A total of 105 patients were randomized to receive 24 weeks of treatment with miglitol (n = 52; titrated from 50 mg to 100 mg 3 times daily) or placebo (n = 53). Concomitant sulfonylurea treatment and diet remained unchanged. The primary endpoint was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints were changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), and postprandial serum insulin (PSI). The miglitol treatment group showed significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and PPG levels compared with the placebo group. With respect to adverse events, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia occurred with similar frequency in both groups. Results of this study indicate that miglitol significantly improves metabolic control in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Miglitol is safe and well tolerated, with the exception of abdominal discomfort. Therefore, miglitol may be a useful adjuvant therapy for Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by diet and sulfonylurea treatment.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most frequently detected conditions in multimorbid disease clusters. Platelet activation is one of the key mechanisms underlying atherothrombosis in acute myocardial infarction. Available data link mean platelet volume (MPV) to poor prognosis not only in cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular disease. Given the lack of research data on the association between disease clusters and MPV, we have set out to investigate the link between multimorbidity and MPV in diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction.A total of 277 patients with DM and STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention were enrolled. Based on the number of comorbidities the study population was divided into two groups: group 1 (N = 58) with ≤ 1 comorbidity and group 2 (N = 219) with ≥ 2 comorbidities. A subanalysis was performed within the multimorbidity group: group 2A with two or three comorbidities (N = 156) and group 2B with at least four comorbidities (N = 63).In the study population, 15.9% of patients had one comorbidity, and 22.0, 34.3, and 22.7% of patients had two, three, or at least four comorbid conditions, respectively. Both MPV and PDW were elevated in multimorbid patients (9.3 vs 10.8 fl and 9.5 vs 10.3 fl, respectively). The highest platelet volume indices were observed in patients with at least four comorbid conditions. There was a moderate positive correlation between MPV and the total number of comorbidities, the number of CVD comorbidities, and the number of non-CVD comorbidities.These findings indicate that multimorbidity is associated with an increase in platelet volume indices. MPV values increased with the increasing number of comorbid conditions. Importantly, MPV values were elevated in some, but not all CVD and non-CVD conditions.",

    "abstract": "Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been successfully used as a treatment for diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). Its mechanism of action on the molecular level, however, is not fully understood. We assessed the effect of NPWT on gene expression in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and DFU. We included two cohorts of patients—individuals treated with either NPWT or standard therapy. The assignment to NWPT was non-randomized and based on wound characteristics. Differential gene expression profiling was performed using Illumina gene expression arrays and R Bioconductor pipelines based on the 'limma' package. The final cohort encompassed 21 patients treated with NPWT and 8 with standard therapy. The groups were similar in terms of age (69.0 versus 67.5 years) and duration of T2DM (14.5 versus 14.4 years). We identified four genes differentially expressed between the two study arms post-treatment, but not pre-treatment: GFRA2 (GDNF family receptor alpha-2), C1QBP (complement C1q binding protein), RAB35 (member of RAS oncogene family) and SYNJ1 (synaptic inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 1). Interestingly, all four genes seemed to be functionally involved in wound healing by influencing re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. Subsequently, we utilized co-expression analysis in publicly available RNA-seq data to reveal the molecular functions of GFRA2 and C1QBP, which appeared to be through direct protein–protein interactions. We found initial evidence that the NPWT effect on DFUs may be mediated through differential gene expression. A discovery of the specific molecular mechanisms of NPWT is potentially valuable for its clinical application and development of new therapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Some patients with diabetic ketoacidosis develop cerebral edema (CE) in the course of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), which may result in central nervous system disorders and high mortality. The imperfection of existing neuroimaging techniques for early recognition of CE forces us to search for the new and non-invasive methods. The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of new methods (pachymetry, transorbital ultrasonography—USG, optical coherence tomography—OCT study) in the assessment of the risk of CE occurrence in children with newly diagnosed T1D. Methods The study group included 50 children with newly diagnosed T1D, 54 patients with long-term T1D as a reference group and 40 children without glucose tolerance disorders as controls. In all subjects, a corneal thickness (CCT) index with pachymeter, optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) using transorbital USG and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) during OCT study were measured and compared with selected clinical parameters of T1D. Results In patients from a study group at onset of T1D, the higher CCT ( p &lt; 0.001) and ONSD ( p &lt; 0.001) values were observed as compared to the results obtained after 48 h of metabolic compensation. The ONSD correlated negatively with pH value ( r = − 0.64; p &lt; 0.001), BE ( r = − 0.54, p &lt; 0.001) and HCO 3− ( r = − 0.50; p &lt; 0.001). A positive correlation between RNFL and Na + levels ( r = 0.47; p &lt; 0.005) was also observed. Conclusions Transorbital USG and pachymetry may serve as the potential promising methods for the non-invasive assessment of the increased risk of development of CE in patients with T1D.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the consequences of oxidative stress and hypoxia on EPAC-1 expression during retinopathy.Oxygen-induced retinopathy was induced in mice and EPAC-1 expression investigated by immunofluorescence. In silico analyses were used to identify a link between EPAC-1 expression and microRNA-7-5p in endothelial cells and confirmed by western blot analyses on cells expressing microRNA-7-5p. In vitro, endothelial cells were either incubated at 2% oxygen or transfected with microRNA-7-5p, and the effects of these treatments on EPAC-1 expression, endothelial hyperpermeability and NO production were assessed. In the Ins2Akita mouse model, levels of EPAC-1 expression as well as microRNA-7-5p were assessed by qPCR. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase was assessed by immunoblotting in the Ins2Akita model.Hypoxia induces the expression of microRNA-7-5p that translationally inhibits the expression of EPAC-1 in endothelial cells, resulting in hyperpermeability and the loss of eNOS activity. Activation of EPAC-1 by the cAMP analogue 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP reduced the sensitivity of EPAC-1 to oxidative stress and restored the endothelial permeability to baseline levels. Additionally, 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP rescued eNOS activity and NO production. In mouse models of retinopathy, i.e., oxygen-induced retinopathy and the spontaneous diabetic heterozygous Ins2Akita mice, EPAC-1 levels are decreased which is associated with an increase in microRNA-7-5p expression and reduced eNOS activity.In retinopathy, EPAC-1 expression is decreased in a microRNA-7-mediated manner, contributing to endothelial dysfunction. Pharmacological activation of remnant EPAC-1 rescues endothelial function. Collectively, these data indicate that EPAC-1 resembles an efficacious and druggable target molecule for the amelioration of (diabetic) retinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Middle Eastern immigrants to western countries are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the heritability and impact of first-degree family history (FH) of type 2 diabetes on insulin secretion and action have not been adequately described. Citizens of Malmö, Sweden, aged 30–75 years born in Iraq or Sweden were invited to participate in this population-based study. Insulin secretion (corrected insulin response and oral disposition index) and action (insulin sensitivity index) were assessed by oral glucose tolerance tests. In total, 45.7% of Iraqis (616/1348) and 27.4% of native Swedes (201/733) had FH in parent(s), sibling(s) or single parent and sibling, i.e., FH+. Approximately 8% of Iraqis and 0.7% of Swedes had ≥ 3 sibling(s) and parent(s) with diabetes, i.e., FH++. Irrespective of family size, prediabetes and diabetes increased with family burden (FH− 29.4%; FH+ 38.8%; FH++ 61.7%) without significant differences across ethnicities. With increasing level of family burden, insulin secretion rather than insulin action decreased. Individuals with a combination of ≥ 3 siblings and parents with diabetes presented with the lowest levels of insulin secretion. The Iraqi immigrant population often present with a strong familial burden of type 2 diabetes with the worst glycemic control and highest diabetes risk in individuals with ≥ 3 siblings and parents with diabetes. Our data show that in a population still free from diabetes familial burden influences insulin secretion to a higher degree than insulin action and may be a logical target for intervention.",

    "abstract": "Published studies show an inconsistent association between age at menarche and the subsequent risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus when pregnant. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to clarify any trends in this association in published observational population studies. We searched online databases for relevant studies, entered into them up until June 21st 2017. Five eligible studies were found and a pooled random effects dose response meta-analysis of results from these was conducted. This included coverage of 58,133 pregnancies, from which 3,035 women developed gestational diabetes. There was evidence of a non-linear association between age at menarche and gestational diabetes (overall p = 1.4 × 10-8; p for non-linearity = 2.4 × 10-4), along with evidence of relatively low heterogeneity (I2 = 25.5%). The largest predicted risk of gestational diabetes was associated with having a low age at menarche; the mean (95% confidence interval) risk relative to that associated with menarche at age 13 years being: 9 years 2.0 (1.6, 2.4), 10 years 1.6 (1.4, 1.9), 11 years 1.3 (1.2, 1.4), 12 years 1.1 (1.1, 1.1), 13 years was the reference, 14 years 1.0 (1.0, 1.0), 15 years 1.1 (0.9, 1.2), 16 years 1.1 (0.9, 1.4). There was evidence of potential publication bias, such that the maximal true relative risk of gestational diabetes, associated with an age at menarche of 9 years, may be closer to 1.6 than 2. Nevertheless, the curvilinear relationship between age at menarche and the future risk of gestational diabetes in pregnancy appears robust.",

The increase is more marked with application of IADPSG-WHO 2013 criteria [1], with very high rates in special populations [2]. Lifestyle modifications are the first step in the management of GDM and medical nutrition therapy is an essential component of it. Maternal diet should provide adequate energy intake to promote maternal and fetal health, help achieve glycemic goals and be culturally appropriate and individualized [3]. DRI for normal weight pregnant women should be taken into account: provide no increase in energy requirement during the first trimester, + 340 kcal/day in the second trimester and + 452 kcal/day in the third; provide > = 175 g carbohydrate/day, 71 g protein/day and 28 g fiber/day; and have an acceptable energy macronutrient distribution range (45–65% of energy from carbohydrates, 20–35% of energy from fat, 10–35% of energy from protein). However, little is known about the characteristics of diets consumed by women with GDM. We aimed to characterize the dietary intake of women with GDM in usual clinical care.",

Therefore, we conducted a survey to characterise the prescribing practices of specialist diabetes healthcare professionals in this region and assessed factors that influence clinical decision-making regarding insulin initiation in T2D. A cross-sectional survey sampled 211 specialist diabetes healthcare prescribers from five Central and South-Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, and Slovenia). A structured questionnaire was developed which surveyed current clinical practices and influencing factors, barriers to insulin initiation, and combination therapy prescribing preferences. Only 9.4% (20 of out of 211 respondents) of healthcare professionals would initiate insulin therapy in T2D patients at the recommended HbA1c threshold of 7–7.9% [53–63 mmol/mol]. Large regional differences were evident in insulin initiation thresholds (≥ 9.0% [≥ 75 mmol/mol]: Bulgaria 80.8% vs. Slovenia 13.3%). Psychological distress was recorded as the major barrier to insulin initiation. Health insurance regulations were ranked more important than personal clinical experience and clinical guidelines in clinical decision-making. Information from peers was more influential than manufacturer information, clinical experience, and continuous medical education, respectively, for insulin initiation. Despite large regional variation, there is widespread delay of insulin initiation from specialist diabetes healthcare professionals in Central and South-Eastern Europe.",

In this review, we sought to determine the evidence base proofs on the antidiabetic treatment capable to reduce the risk of COVID-19-related mortality. Methods We have performed a systematic search of published articles using PubMed, and EMBASE from March 2020 to March 31st, 2021. We excluded editorials, commentary, letters to the editor, reviews, and studies that did not have mortality as an outcome. For metformin and insulin only, we performed a meta-analysis using Cochrane RevMan 5.2. Results Among antidiabetic drugs, metformin was the only drug associated with a reduced risk of mortality. Conversely, insulin appears associated with an increased risk. The other classes of drugs were neutral. Conclusions The totality of articles reports retrospective data strongly affected by “channeling bias” so that most of the existing results on each class of drugs are driven by the phenotype of patients likely to receive that specific drug by prescription.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Disturbances in circadian rhythms may promote cardiometabolic disorders in rotating night shift workers (r-NSWs). We hypothesized that timed light therapy might reverse disrupted circadian rhythms and glucose intolerance observed among r-NSWs). Methods R-NSWs were randomly assigned to a protocol that included 12 weeks on followed by 12 weeks off light therapy ( n = 13; 6 men; mean age, 39.5 ± 7.3 years) or a no-treatment control group ( n = 9; 3 men; mean age 41.7 ± 6.3 years). Experimental and control participants underwent identical metabolic evaluations that included anthropometric, metabolic (including oral glucose tolerance tests), lipid, and inflammation-associated parameters together with an assessment of sleep quality and expression of circadian transcription factors REV-ERBα and BMAL1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks of the protocol. Results Twelve weeks of warm white-light exposure (10,000 lx at 35 cm for 30 min per day) had no impact on sleep, metabolic, or inflammation-associated parameters among r-NSWs in the experimental group. However, our findings revealed significant decreases in REV-ERBα gene expression ( p = 0.048) and increases in the REV-ERBα/BMAL1 ratio ( p = 0.040) compared to baseline in PBMCs isolated from this cohort. Diminished expression of REV-ERBα persisted, although the REV-ERBα/BMAL1 ratio returned to baseline levels after the subsequent 12-day wash-out period. Conclusions Our results revealed that intermittent light therapy had no impact on inflammatory parameters or glucose tolerance in a defined cohort of r-NSWs. However, significant changes in the expression of circadian clock genes were detected in PBMCs of these subjects undergoing light therapy.",

The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 was used to assess adherence to insulin therapy.Among 223 respondents (108 with type 1 diabetes; 115 with type 2 diabetes), the most prominent unmet need was the necessity to overcome the cognitive burden of care associated with measuring, calculating, timing, and recording therapy. Only 25% of respondents had high adherence; 28% had low adherence.When asked to compare the attributes of a non-connected insulin pen with those of a new connected device, 71% of patients rated the new proposal \"very useful\".

Methods Data from 33,372 pediatric T1D patients from the Diabetes Prospective Follow-up (DPV) registry, with face-to-face visits or telemedicine contacts in the years 2019–2021, were available. Datasets from eight time periods between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2021, according to SARS-CoV2 incidence waves, were compared to those from five control time periods. Parameters of metabolic control were assessed with adjustment for sex, age, diabetes duration, and repeated measurements. Laboratory-measured HbA1c values and those estimated from CGM were aggregated into a combined glucose indicator (CGI). Results There was no clinically relevant difference in metabolic control between pandemic and control time periods with adjusted CGI values ranging from 7.61% [7.60–7.63] (mean [95% confidence interval (CI)]) in the third quarter of 2019 to 7.83% [7.82–7.85] in the time period from January 1 to March 15 2020, in the other control periods, and during the pandemic, CGI values lay between these values. BMI-SDS rose during the pandemic from 0.29 [0.28–0.30] (mean [95% CI]) in the third quarter of 2019 to 0.40 [0.39–0.41] during the fourth wave. Adjusted insulin dose rose during the pandemic. Event rates for hypoglycemic coma and diabetic ketoacidosis remained unchanged. Conclusions We found no clinically relevant change of glycemic control or incidence of acute diabetes complications during the pandemic. The observed BMI increase may represent an important health risk for youth with T1D.",

Methods This observational case‒control study was conducted from July 1, 2022, to November 30, 2022, at the outpatient ophthalmology clinic of the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. All subjects underwent baseline data entry and mean thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), the thickness of each retinal layer in the macula 3 × 3 mm, and vascular density (VD) examination. Results The study included 35 healthy individuals and 48 patients with DM. The retinal VD as well as partial pRNFL, macular nerve fiber layer (NFL), and macular ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness in DM patients exhibited significantly lower VD in the DM group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Age and disease duration of DM patients showed a negative trend with pRNFL thickness, macular NFL thickness, macular GCL thickness, and VD. However, a positive trend was observed between DM duration and partial inner nuclear layer (INL) thickness. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between macular NFL and GCL thickness and VD for the most part, while a negative correlation was shown between INL temporal thickness and DVC-VD. pRNFL-TI and GCL-superior thickness were screened as two variables in the analysis of the predictors of retinal damage in DM according to the presence or absence of DM. The AUCs were 0.765 and 0.673, respectively. By combining the two indicators for diagnosis, the model predicted prognosis with an AUC of 0.831. In the analysis of retinal damage indicators associated with the duration of DM, after regression logistic analysis according to the duration of DM within 5 years and more than 5 years, the model incorporated two indicators, DVC-VD and pRNFL-N thickness, and the AUCs were 0.764 and 0.852, respectively. Combining the two indicators for diagnosis, the AUC reached 0.925. Conclusions Retinal NVU may have been compromised in patients with DM without retinopathy. Basic clinical information and rapid noninvasive OCT and OCTA techniques are useful for the quantitative assessment of retinal NVU prognosis in patients with DM without retinopathy.",

Candidate SNPs were genotyped using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with next-generation sequencing methods, and the association of these SNPs with GDM was analyzed.We found that GCKR rs1260326 was significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM in the allele model, the codominant model (CC vs. TT), the dominant model, the recessive model, and the genotypic model distributions (p = 0.0029, p = 0.0022, p = 0.0402, p = 0.0038, and p = 0.0028, respectively). The rs1260326 polymorphism was shown to be associated with 1 h-OGTT level and gravidity in GDM patients (CC vs. TT: p = 0.0475 and p = 0.0220, respectively). Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was significantly higher in the GDM patients with the rs266729 GG genotype compared to those with the CC or CG genotype (p = 0.0444 and p = 0.0339, respectively). The DBP of the GDM patients with the rs1501299 GT genotype was lower than that of those with the GG genotype (p = 0.0197).

    "abstract": "The present study assessed the effect of high intensity interval training on cardiac function during prolonged submaximal exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes. Twenty-six patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to a 12 week of high intensity interval training (3 sessions/week) or standard care control group. All patients underwent prolonged (i.e. 60 min) submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (at 50% of previously assess maximal functional capacity) with non-invasive gas-exchange and haemodynamic measurements including cardiac output and stroke volume before and after the intervention. At baseline (prior to intervention) there was no significant difference between the intervention and control group in peak exercise oxygen consumption (20.3 ± 6.1 vs. 21.7 ± 5.5 ml/kg/min, p = 0.21), and peak exercise heart rate (156.3 ± 15.0 vs. 153.8 ± 12.5 beats/min, p = 0.28). During follow-up assessment both groups utilized similar amount of oxygen during prolonged submaximal exercise (15.0 ± 2.4 vs. 15.2 ± 2.2 ml/min/kg, p = 0.71). However, cardiac function i.e. cardiac output during submaximal exercise decreased significantly by 21% in exercise group (16.2 ± 2.7–12.8 ± 3.6 L/min, p = 0.03), but not in the control group (15.7 ± 4.9–16.3 ± 4.1 L/min, p = 0.12). Reduction in exercise cardiac output observed in the exercise group was due to a significant decrease in stroke volume by 13% (p = 0.03) and heart rate by 9% (p = 0.04). Following high intensity interval training patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrate reduced cardiac output during prolonged submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Ability of patients to maintain prolonged increased metabolic demand but with reduced cardiac output suggests cardiac protective role of high intensity interval training in type 2 diabetes.

    "abstract": "Associations have been reported between age at menarche and the later risk of gestational diabetes. However, it is not known whether these associations reflect differences in insulin sensitivity and/or pancreatic β-cell function in pregnancy.We examined this question in women enrolled in the prospective Cambridge Baby Growth Study who recalled their age at menarche in questionnaires during pregnancy. Polynomial logistic and linear regression models were used to relate menarche timing to the risk of gestational diabetes, both unadjusted and adjusted for the Homeostasis Model Assessments of insulin resistance (HOMA IR) and pancreatic β-cell function (HOMA B) at week 28 of pregnancy.Age at menarche showed a U-shaped association with gestational diabetes risk (linear term: p = 9.5 × 10-4; quadratic term: p = 1.0 × 10-3; n = 889; overall model p = 8.1 × 10-3). Age at menarche showed a negative linear association with insulin resistance (HOMA IR: β = -0.13, p = 5.2 × 10-4, n = 771), which explained the relationship between age at menarche and gestational diabetes risk (adjusted linear term going from p = 0.03-0.08; adjusted quadratic term going from p = 0.04-0.08; n = 771). Age at menarche also showed a negative linear association with β-cell function (HOMA B: β = -0.11, p = 2.8 × 10-3, n = 771) but this did not attenuate the relationship between age at menarche and gestational diabetes (adjusted linear term p = 0.02; adjusted quadratic term p = 0.03, n = 771).These results suggest that the associations between age at menarche and risk of gestational diabetes and raised pregnancy glucose concentrations may be mediated by insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes leads to multiple sensory dysfunctions affecting notably the gustatory sensitivity. Although this sensory defect, by impacting food choices, might lead to unhealthy eating behavior, underlying mechanisms remains poorly studied. We have recently reported that the composition of microbiota in contact with circumvallate gustatory papillae might affect the orosensory perception of lipids in lean and normoglycemic obese subjects. This finding has prompted us to explore whether such a phenomenon also occurs in diabetic obese patients.The composition of microbiota surrounding the circumvallate papillae was analyzed in combination with the linoleic acid perception thresholds in male insulin-resistant patients and weight-matched healthy controls. Two complementary comparisons were performed: (1) controls vs diabetic and (2) diabetic low-lipid tasters versus diabetic high-lipid tasters.Despite subtle modifications in the oral microbiota composition, comparison of orosensory lipid perception in controls and diabetic subjects did not lead to discriminating data due to the large inter-individual variability of linoleic acid perception thresholds. In contrast, specific bacterial signatures were found by comparing diabetic low- and high-lipid tasters leading to differential molecular pathways. Surprisingly, a lower fatty taste perception was mainly found in patients treated with metformin and/or statins, suggesting a possible side effect of these antidiabetic and/or hypolipidemic drugs on taste acuity.Collectively, these data show that the diabetic patients with defective fatty taste detection are characterized by a specific microbiota metabolism at the circumvallate papillae levels, this occurrence seeming amplified by drugs commonly used to counteract the damaging metabolic effects of T2D.

The present study aimed to investigate the causal association between Hcy and CAD in individuals with diabetes. Methods A 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was designed to infer causality. Genetic summary data on the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with Hcy were extracted from the hitherto largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of up to 44,147 individuals of European ancestry. SNP-CAD data were obtained from another recently published GWAS which included 15,666 individuals with diabetes (3,968 CAD cases, 11,696 controls). The fixed-effects inverse variance-weighted method was employed to calculate the effect estimates. Other robust methods and leave-one-out analyses were used in the follow-up sensitivity analyses. Potential pleiotropy was assessed with the MR-Egger intercept test. Results The 2-sample MR analysis suggested no evidence of an association between genetically predicted plasma Hcy levels and CAD risk in individuals with diabetes (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.82–1.58, p = 0.43) using 9 SNPs as instrumental variables. Similar results were observed in the follow-up sensitivity analyses. The MR-Egger intercept test indicated no evidence of directional pleiotropy (intercept = 0.03, 95% confidence interval: − 0.08–0.03, p = 0.35). Conclusion This 2-sample MR analysis found no evidence of a causal association between plasma Hcy levels and CAD risk in individuals with diabetes.",

Methods We enrolled 186 individuals (47.8% men; median age 40.0, IQR 33.0—45.0 years) with type 1 diabetes (median diabetes duration of 21.6, IQR 18.2—30.3 years), and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, as part of the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study. All individuals underwent a biochemical work-up, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound of the common carotid arteries and arterial tonometry. Arterial structural and functional parameters were assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), pulse wave velocity and augmentation index. Results Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) were present in 23.7% and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in 16.7% of individuals with type 1 diabetes. Those with type 1 diabetes and CMBs had higher median (IQR) CIMT 583 (525 – 663) μm than those without 556 (502 – 607) μm, p = 0.016). Higher CIMT was associated with the presence of CMBs ( p = 0.046) independent of age, eGFR, ApoB, systolic blood pressure, albuminuria, history of retinal photocoagulation and HbA 1c . Arterial stiffness and CIMT were increased in individuals with type 1 diabetes and WMHs compared to those without; however, these results were not independent of cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions Structural, but not functional, arterial changes are associated with underlying CMBs in asymptomatic individuals with type 1 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic neuropathy is among the most frequent complications of both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and commonly manifests as a distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN). Despite evidence that T1DM- and T2DM-related DSPN are separate entities, most of our knowledge on diabetic DSPN derives from studies focused on type 2 diabetes. This systematic review provides an overview of current evidence on DSPN in T1DM, including its epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical features, along with principal diagnostic tests findings. This review included 182 clinical and preclinical studies. The results indicate that DSPN is a less frequent complication in T1DM compared with T2DM and that distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms underlie T1DM-related DSPN development, with hyperglycemia as a major determinant. T1DM-related DSPN more frequently manifests with non-painful than painful symptoms, with lower neuropathic pain prevalence compared with T2DM-associated DSPN. The overt clinical picture seems characterized by a higher prevalence of large fiber-related clinical signs (e.g., ankle reflexes reduction and vibration hypoesthesia) and to a lesser extent small fiber damage (e.g., thermal or pinprick hypoesthesia). These findings as a whole suggest that large fibers impairment plays a dominant role in the clinical picture of symptomatic T1DM-related DSPN. Nevertheless, small fiber diagnostic testing shows high diagnostic accuracy in detecting early nerve damage and may be an appropriate diagnostic tool for disease monitoring and screening.",

Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the most commonly used test when diagnosing peripheral macrovascular disease and is a well-known marker for increased cardiovascular risk. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) is considered to better evaluate microvascular function and has in previous studies shown correlations with both wound healing and survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined impact of a low TcPO2 (<30 mmHg) and a pathological ABI (<0.9 or ≥1.4) on three-year mortality in patients with DFU.Type 2 diabetes patients aged <90 years, with at least one DFU who underwent vascular assessment with ABI and TcPO2 were screened for participation. The primary endpoint was mortality after three years, assessed from the National Death Registry in Sweden.The study enrolled 235 participants with a median age of 76 years. Individuals with either an abnormally high or low ABI in combination with a low TcPO2 had the worst survival rates, with three-year mortality of 54%, compared to 42% in those with one abnormal variable (either ABI or TcPO2), and 21% in those with normal ABI and TcPO2.Combining ABI and TcPO2 when risk stratifying DFU patients seems to provide additional predictive information, not only concerning ulcer healing and limb salvage, but also on survival.",

The aim was to examine the association of glucose-lowering drugs with incident stroke and transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of the disease analyzer, which comprises a representative panel of 1248 general and internal medicine practices throughout Germany (01/2000-12/2019: 9.8 million patients). Incident non-fatal stroke/TIA was defined based on ICD-10 codes (I63, I64; G45) in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Cox regression models were fitted to obtain hazard ratios (HR; 95%CI) for stroke/TIA adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, health insurance, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, polyneuropathy, blood pressure, eGFR) and anthropometric and metabolic intermediators (BMI, HbA1c, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid-lowering drugs).312,368 persons with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes without previous stroke/TIA (mean age: 64 years; 52% males) were included. There were 16,701 events of non-fatal stroke/TIA corresponding to an incidence rate of 9.3 (95%CI 9.1-9.4) per 1000 person-years. Using Cox regression, adjusted HR for stroke/TIA (per 1 year of treatment) of 0.59 (0.54-0.64) for SGLT2 inhibitors and of 0.79 (0.74-0.85) for GLP-1 receptor agonists were estimated. DPP-4 inhibitors (0.84; 0.82-0.86), metformin (0.90; 0.89-0.91), insulin (0.92; 0.91-0.93) and sulfonylureas (0.98; 0.96-0.99) also showed moderately reduced HR for stroke/TIA.

All the relevant data were retrieved, analyzed, and summarized.Six studies (252 GDM cases and 309 controls) were included and analyzed. The six studies reported the expressions of 21 miRNAs in GDM cases. Of the 21 miRNAs, 12 miRNAs were found to be upregulated, and two were downregulated. The top three most consistently reported upregulated miRNAs were miR-16-5p (mean differences of fold change are 1.25, 95% CI = 0.04-2.46, P = 0.040), miR-19a-3p (mean differences of fold change are 2.90, 95% CI = 1.45-4.35, P = 0.001), and miR-19b-3p (mean differences of fold change are 3.10, 95% CI = 0.94-5.25, P = 0.005). miR-155-5p and miR-21-3p were found to be downregulated.The results indicate that several miRNAs may be used as markers for diabetes gestational diabetes mellitus.

Methods This register-based national cohort study included 287,684 births from 2013 to 2017. Trends in GDM prevalence over time and differences between the five regions were evaluated. Crude and adjusted odd ratios (ORs) for GDM were calculated including potential confounding clinical risk factors as age, BMI, educational level, marital status, parity, country of origin and assisted reproduction. Results From 2013 to 2017, GDM prevalence in Denmark increased by 7% per year (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06–1.09, P &lt; 0.001). GDM prevalence varied considerably between regions and ranged from 3.0 to 5.9% in 2017, corresponding to a maximal regional difference of 97%. In crude analyses, the risk of GDM in 2017 was significantly different in four of five regions compared to the remaining regions (OR ranging from 0.60 to 1.55), and these differences persisted after adjusting for confounding clinical risk factors (adjusted OR: 0.59–1.45). Conclusion The prevalence of GDM increased over time in all Danish regions with substantial regional divergence. Up to a 97%, difference in GDM prevalence was observed between Danish regions, which was not explained by available clinical risk factors. This occurred despite national guidelines and raises the question of whether regional variations in screening efficacy, diagnostic procedures or inequality in clinical health care access may explain the observed differences.",

This study aims to assess de association between exercise and glycemic management in people with T1D and to identify the main barriers to exercise in T1D.We evaluated 95 people with T1D treated with insulin pump therapy. Participants answered a questionnaire about 1) exercise habits, 2) usual adjustments in insulin and food intake with exercise and 3) main barriers to exercise. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was used to evaluate time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR) and time above range (TAR) during the last 60 days before the evaluation. CGM data during, before (2 h before) and after (24 h after) the last bout of exercise was also evaluated.The mean age was 30.1 ± 12.1 years, and 51.6% were women. Participants that reported practicing exercise (55.8%) had a higher TIR (59.6 ± 16.3 vs. 48.7 ± 15.7, p = 0.012) and a lower TAR (32.6 ± 15.8 vs. 45.4 ± 17.7, p = 0.006). Comparing with the 60 days CGM data, the TBR was lower in the 2 h before exercise (- 1.8 ± 3.8, p = 0.0454) and TAR was lower during (- 16.9 ± 33.6, p = 0.0320) and in the 24 h after (- 8.7 ± 17.2, p = 0.032) the last bout of exercise. The absence of adjustments on insulin and food intake was associated with higher TBR after the exercise (13.44 ± 3.5, p < 0.05). Eating before the exercise and turning off the pump during the exercise were associated with lower TBR after exercise (food booster: - 7.56 ± 3.49, p < 0.05; turning off insulin pump - 8.87 ± 3.52, p < 0.05). The main barriers reported for exercise practicing were fear of hypoglycemia, lack of free time and work schedule.Exercise was associated with better glycemic management in people with T1D. Addressing common barriers may allow a higher adherence to exercise in T1D.",

Methods Serum adropin level and liver fat content were assessed in patients with T2DM and MAFLD (n = 22), along with healthy controls (n = 22). Afterward, the patients received liraglutide treatment for 12 weeks. Serum adropin levels were examined by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Liver fat content was quantified via magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Results We found that patients with newly diagnosed T2DM and MAFLD had lower serum adropin levels [2.79 ± 0.47 vs. 3.27 ± 0.79 ng/mL, P &lt; 0.05] and higher liver fat content [19.12 ± 9.46 vs. 4.67 ± 0.61%, P &lt; 0.001], compared to healthy controls. Following 12-week liraglutide treatment, serum adropin levels increased from 2.83(2.44, 3.24) to 3.65(3.20, 3.85) ng/mL ( P &lt; 0.001), and liver fat content decreased from 18.04(11.08, 27.65) to 7.74(6.42, 13.49) % ( P &lt; 0.001) in patients with T2DM and MAFLD. Furthermore, increases in serum adropin were strongly associated with decreases in liver fat content (β = − 5.933, P &lt; 0.001), liver enzyme and glucolipid metabolism parameters. Conclusion The increase in serum adropin level following liraglutide treatment was strongly correlated with the reduction in liver fat content and glucolipid metabolism. Hence, adropin might be a potential marker for the beneficial effects of liraglutide on treating T2DM and MAFLD.",

Moreover, the frequency of IgM- and IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated in 41 newly diagnosed T1D patients not yet vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 disease, collected during the pandemic, compared to healthy subjects (CTRL). Results None of the 99 patients that contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pandemic period was found positive for T1D autoantibodies. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was not significantly different in patients newly diagnosed with T1D (12.2%), compared with CTRL (8.4%). Among SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive T1D patients, 80% were target of diabetes autoantibodies and 60% had another concomitant autoimmune disease. Among the CTRL subjects positive for SARS-CoV-2Abs ( n = 10), none was found positive for T1D autoantibodies. Conclusions The results of the present study do not confirm, at least in the short term, a role of COVID-19 as a potential trigger of T1D autoimmunity and do not provide evidence of an increased frequency of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in newly diagnosed T1D patients in comparison with healthy population.",

We aimed to assess the impact of AKI and its severity and duration on the risk of hypoglycaemia in hospitalized patients with T2D.Retrospective cohort analysis of patients with T2D, admitted at a University Hospital in 2018-2019. AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dl (48 h) or ≥ 1.5 times baseline (7 days), and hypoglycaemia as blood glucose concentration < 70 mg/dl. Patients with chronic kidney disease stage ≥ 4 were excluded. We registered 239 hospitalizations with AKI and randomly selected 239 without AKI (control). Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding factors and ROC curve analysis to determine a cutoff for AKI duration.The risk of hypoglycaemia was higher in the AKI group (crude OR 3.6, 95%CI 1.8-9.6), even after adjusting for covariates (OR 4.2, 95%CI 1.8-9.6). Each day of AKI duration was associated with a 14% increase in the risk of hypoglycaemia (95%CI 1.1-1.2), and a cutoff of 5.5 days of AKI duration was obtained for increased risk of hypoglycaemia and mortality. AKI severity was also associated with mortality, but showed no significant association with hypoglycaemia. Patients with hypoglycaemia had 4.4 times greater risk of mortality (95%CI 2.4-8.2).AKI increased the risk of hypoglycaemia during hospitalization of patients with T2D, and its duration was the main risk factor.

Methods Process and outcome indicators and the related information derived from electronic medical records were identified. A network of pediatric diabetes centers was created on a voluntary basis. Results Overall, 20 centers provided data on 3284 patients aged &lt; = 18 years. HbA1c was monitored ≥ 2/year in 81.2% of the cases. BMI was monitored ≥ 1/year in 99.0%, lipid profile in 45.3%, and blood pressure in 91.7%. Pubertal status, albuminuria, eye examination, and screening of celiac disease and thyroiditis were underreported. From 2017 to 2021, average HbA1c levels decreased from 7.8 ± 1.2 to 7.6 ± 1.3%, while patients with LDL cholesterol &gt; 100 mg/dl increased from 18.9 to 36.7%. Prevalence of patients with elevated blood pressure and BMI/SDS values also increased. In 2021, 44.7% of patients were treated with the newest basal insulins, while use of regular human insulin had dropped to 7.7%. Use of insulin pump remained stable (37.9%). Conclusions This report documents the feasibility of the ISPED CARD initiative and shows lights and shadows in the care provided. Improving care, increasing number of centers, and ameliorating data recording represent future challenges.",

This study aimed at assessing the independent association of age at type 2 diabetes diagnosis with all-cause mortality. Methods This prospective cohort study enrolled 15,773 Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes in 19 Italian centers in 2006–2008. Cardiometabolic risk profile and presence of complications and comorbidities were assessed at baseline and participants were stratified by quartiles of age at diabetes diagnosis. All-cause mortality was verified on 31 October 2015. Results Valid information on vital status was retrieved for 15,656 participants (99.3%). Patients in the lowest quartile had the longest diabetes duration, the worst glycemic control and the highest prevalence of insulin treatment, obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and smoking habits. All complications were inversely associated with age at diabetes diagnosis after adjustment for age and sex, but not after further adjustment for diabetes duration. Percentages of death, Kaplan–Meier estimates, and unadjusted hazard ratios and mortality rates increased from the lowest to the highest quartile. In contrast, when adjusting for age and sex, participants falling in the lowest quartile, showed the highest mortality risk [hazard ratio 1.321 (95% confidence interval 1.196–1.460), P &lt; 0.0001]. However, differences among quartiles disappeared after adjustment for diabetes duration, complications/comorbidities, or other cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions Type 2 diabetes onset in young adulthood is associated with increased mortality that is mainly driven by longer diabetes duration favoring the development of complications.

Aim To compare the night-time (from 00 to 07 a.m.) effectiveness in achieving recommended glycemic targets of three different AHCL systems in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods We retrospectively evaluated 55 adults with T1D (mean age 41 ± 16 years, male 40%, diabetes duration 19.4 ± 11.4 years, BMI 24.1 ± 4.1 kg/m 2 ) with similar glycemic control (GMI 7.0–7.4%). Twenty-two participants were using the Minimed 780G system, 18 the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ system and 15 the DBLG1 system. Continuous glucose monitoring derived metrics and insulin requirement of 14 consecutive nights were analyzed. Results All three groups achieved the recommended mean TIR &gt; 70%, mean TBR &lt; 4%, and mean CV &lt; 36% with a similar insulin requirement (Minimed 780G system: TIR 73.9 ± 11.2%, TBR 0.9 ± 1.2%, CV 29 ± 6.7%; Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ system: TIR 74.1 ± 11.1%, TBR 1.1 ± 1.0%, CV 34.5 ± 6.6%; DBLG1 System TIR 71.7 ± 11.3%, TBR 1.4 ± 3.7%, CV 32.4 ± 7.1%). Tight TIR% (70–140 mg/dl) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) in the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ group (51.5 ± 9.8%) when compared to Minimed 780G group (42.1 ± 13.7%) and DBLG1 System (40.1 ± 10.5%). In all three groups the insulin infusion similarly decreased from midnight to 05.00 am and then increased. Conclusions All the three AHCL systems achieved the recommended TIR, TBR and CV without difference in insulin requirement. The Tandem Control-IQ system obtained a higher tight TIR.",

    "abstract": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activation of pancreatic β-cells elevates intracellular Ca2+ and potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, it activates a number of signaling molecules, including ERK1/2, whose activation has been shown to play an important role in regulating pancreatic β-cell function and mass. The aim of this work was to determine how mAChR activation elevates intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i ) and activates ERK1/2 in the pancreatic β-cell line MIN6. We demonstrate that agonist-stimulated ERK1/2 activation is dependent on the activation of phospholipase C and an elevation in [Ca2+] i , but is independent of the activation of diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase C isoenzymes. Using a pharmacological approach, we provide evidence that agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+] i and ERK activity require (1) IP3 receptor-mediated mobilization of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, (2) influx of extracellular Ca2+ through store-operated channels, (3) closure of KATP channels, and (4) Ca2+ entry via L-type voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. Moreover, this Ca2+-dependent activation of ERK is mediated via both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanisms. In summary, this study provides important insights into the multifactorial signaling mechanisms linking mAChR activation to increases in [Ca2+] i and ERK activity.",

    "abstract": "Stress and severe life events (SLEs) modify autoimmune disease susceptibility. Here, we aimed to establish if SLEs reported by parents during the first 2 years of life influence the risk of developing type 1 diabetes (T1D) using data from the prospective Diabetes Prediction in Skåne (DiPiS) study.Prospective questionnaire data recorded at 2 months (n = 23,187) and 2 years of age (n = 3784) from the DiPiS cohort of children were included in the analysis. SLEs were analyzed both by groups and as a combined variable. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for T1D diagnosis for the total cohort and for the HLA-DQ2/8 high-risk population. Affected first-degree relatives, HLA-DQ risk group, paternal education level, and parents' country of birth were included as covariates.There was a significantly increased risk of T1D in children with SLEs occurring during the child's first 2 years of life for both the total cohort (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.1, 2.7; p = 0.03) and the DQ2/8 cohort (HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1, 4.2; p = 0.018). Subgroup analysis of events related to unemployment, divorce, or family conflict showed a significant hazard for these events occurring both during and after pregnancy in the DQ2/8 cohort (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.1, 4.3; p = 0.03 and HR 4.98; 95% CI 2.3, 11; p < 0.001, respectively) and after pregnancy in the total cohort (multiple regression HR 2.07; 95% CI 1.01, 4.2; p = 0.047).Children of parents experiencing an SLE during the child's first 2 years of life were at increased risk of T1D. Further studies including those measuring immune and stress-related biomarkers are necessary to validate the findings.",

    "abstract": "To assess whether disturbances in glucose regulation are associated with impairment in physical performance during a 10-year follow-up. 475 Men and 603 women from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study were studied. Glucose regulation was evaluated with a 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 2001–2004. Subjects were categorised as having either impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), newly diagnosed diabetes or previously known diabetes. Physical performance was assessed approximately 10 years later using the validated senior fitness test (SFT). The relationship between glucose regulation and the overall SFT score was estimated using multiple linear regression models. The mean age was 70.8 years for men and 71.0 years for women when physical performance was assessed. The mean SFT score for the whole population was 45.0 (SD 17.5) points. The SFT score decreased gradually with increased impairment in glucose regulation. Individuals with previously known diabetes had the lowest overall SFT score in the fully adjusted model (mean difference compared to normoglycaemic individuals − 11.56 points, 95% CI − 16.15 to − 6.98, p < 0.001). Both individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes and individuals with IGT had significantly poorer physical performance compared to those with normoglycaemia. No significant difference in physical performance was found between those with IFG and those with normoglycaemia. Among older people, impaired glucose regulation is strongly related with poor physical performance. More severe disturbances in glucose regulation are associated with a greater decrease in physical function, indicating the importance of diagnosing these disturbances at an early stage.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of gestational diabetes has been reported to have risen over the first decade of this century. Some studies have also found it to vary with seasons of the year. We investigated temporal and seasonal trends on gestational diabetes incidence in a single-centre cohort study from Cambridge, UK, and attempted to explain trends using associated risk factors.Using a cosinor model, we tested both temporal and seasonal trends in gestational diabetes incidence in 1074 women recruited to the Cambridge Baby Growth Study in 2001-2009 who underwent oral glucose tolerance tests around week 28 of pregnancy.There was a temporal increase in gestational diabetes incidence over the course of recruitment to this study [0.014 (0.005, 0.022) proportional increase per year, p = 2.1 × 10-3], but no seasonal effect (p = 0.7). HOMA B [- 0.015 (- 0.025, - 0.005) per year, p = 3.0 × 10-3] and the insulin disposition index [- 0.036 (- 0.060, - 0.013) per year, p = 3.0 × 10-3], unlike HOMA S, showed negative temporal trends. Risk factor analyses showed a concomitant temporal slight increase in the index of multiple deprivation [0.191 (0.138, 0.257) units per year, p = 4.6 × 10-10]. This index was positively associated with HOMA B (p = 6.1 × 10-5) but not directly with gestational diabetes (p = 0.6), HOMA S (p = 0.2) or the insulin disposition index (p = 0.4).In this cohort, there were temporal, but not seasonal, increases in gestational diabetes incidence between the years 2001 and 2009, which appeared to be related more to reductions in insulin secretion than sensitivity. Possible mediators of this link include confounding factors related to deprivation.",

However, based on available data on beta-cell proliferation, calculations can be made suggesting that the dynamics of the endocrine pancreas is considerable even during adulthood, with islet neogenesis and a sustained increase in size of already formed islets. Islet-associated hemorrhages, frequently observed in most mammals including humans, could account for a considerable loss of islet parenchyma balancing the constant beta-cell proliferation. Notably, in subjects with type 1 diabetes, periductal accumulation of leukocytes and fibrosis is frequently observed, findings that are likely to negatively affect islet neogenesis from endocrine progenitor cells present in the periductal area. Impaired neogenesis would disrupt the balance, result in loss of islet mass, and eventually lead to beta-cell deficiency and compromised glucose metabolism, with increased islet workload and blood perfusion of remaining islets. These changes would impose initiation of a vicious circle further increasing the frequency of vascular events and hemorrhages within remaining islets until the patient eventually loses all beta-cells and becomes c-peptide negative.",

    "abstract": "Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is diagnosed as coexistence of diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, where pancreatic beta cell destruction is associated with neurodegeneration. Typically, WFS necessitates insulin treatment similar to type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the mechanism of beta cell mass reduction leading to hyperglycemia is different. The aim of the study was to assess glycemic variability using the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system in seven pediatric patients with genetically confirmed WFS and compare the results with data obtained from 21 propensity score-matched patients with T1D. The \"GlyCulator\" application was used for the calculation of glycemic variability indices. CGM recordings showed similarities in glycemic variability among WFS patients, but differing from those of the T1D group. Coefficient of variation (%CV), CONGA4h, and GONGA6h were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in WFS patients (28.08 ± 7.37, 54.96 ± 11.92, and 55.99 ± 10.58) than in T1D patients (37.87 ± 14.24, 74.12 ± 28.74, p = 0.02, and 80.26 ± 35.05, respectively). In WFS patients, the percentage of values above 126 mg/dL was 69.79 (52.08–77.43), whereas in patients with T1D, the percentage was significantly lower—47.22 (35.07–62.85, p = 0.018). Curiously, a tendency toward a lower percentage of measurements below 70 mg/dL was noted in the WFS group [0 (0–7.29)] in comparison with the T1D group [6.25 (0–18.06), p = 0.122]. WFS patients had a significantly higher C-peptide level (0.31 ± 0.2 ng/mL) than T1D patients (0.04 ± 0.04 ng/mL; p = 0.006). Patients with WFS show smaller glycemic variability than individuals with T1D, and this may be associated with persistent residual insulin secretion.",

    "abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms may contribute to platelet reactivity in diabetic patients; however, the information on their influence on long-term antiplatelet therapy is lacking. Our aim was to evaluate the role of previously described genetic variants and platelet reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.Blood samples were obtained from 303 Caucasian patients. Genome-wide genotyping was performed using Illumina Human Omni 2.5-Quad microarrays, and individual genotyping of selected SNPs was performed using a custom Sequenom iPLEX assay in conjunction with the Mass ARRAY platform. Platelet reactivity was measured with VerifyNow Aspirin Assay and PFA-100 Assay. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of genetic variants and platelets reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events.Among the 237 patients included in the follow-up, death from any cause occurred in 34 (14.3%) patients and cardiovascular events occurred in 51 (21.5%) patients within a median observation time of 71 months (5.9 years). In univariate analyses, significant association in the presence of minor alleles in TXBA2R (rs1131882) with primary (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.15-5.60, p = 0.021) and secondary endpoint (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.06-4.04, p = 0.034) was observed. In addition, multivariate analyses revealed the impact of this polymorphism on primary (HR 2.34, 95% CI 1.09-5.00, p = 0.029) and secondary endpoint (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.00-3.57, p = 0.048).Results of the study demonstrate for the first time an association between genetic polymorphism within TXBA2R gene encoding platelet's surface receptor and long-term survival of diabetic patients treated with ASA.",

The aim of the present study is to estimate the awareness of liver disease among patients with T2D and whether it differs according to the degree of liver fibrosis estimated by transient elastography (TE). Methods This is a population-based cross-sectional study. We included all patients with T2D that participated in the 2017–2018 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and underwent a TE examination. Presence of liver steatosis and fibrosis was assessed by the median values of controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness measurement, respectively. Results Among the 825 patients included in the analysis, 8.1% (95% CI 5.1%-12.7%) of patients with steatosis were aware of having a liver condition. Even if awareness increased proportionally with increasing severity of organ damage, it remained limited even among patients with advanced fibrosis (17.9%, 95% CI 8.8%-33.3%). Conclusions Despite increasing evidence of a frequent hepatic involvement associated with poor prognosis, awareness of suffering of advanced liver disease in patients with T2D is remarkably low, likely reflecting little recognition also among the team of health care professionals.",

Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with an increased prevalence of PDs. A two-way relationship between diabetes and periodontitis has been proposed, with diabetes increasing the risk for periodontitis, and periodontal inflammation negatively affecting glycaemic control. To date, the relationship between PD and glucose variability in type 1 diabetes has not been evaluated. To investigate the prevalence of PD in patients with type 1 diabetes and its association with glycemic control and glucose variability. Methods In this cross-sectional study, all enrolled patients were scheduled to attend both a diabetologic and a periodontal visit. HbA1c, glucose coefficient of variation (CV), loss of clinical attachment (CAL), and periodontal probing depth (PPD) were collected. Results 136 patients were included in the analysis. The prevalence of PD was 63%. A significant correlation was found between mean CAL and glucose CV ( r = 0.31, p = 0.002), but not with HbA1c. Mean PPD was also associated with glucose CV ( r = 0.27 and 0.044), but not with HbA1c. In a multiple linear regression model, with mean CAL as dependent variable, age, glucose CV, and smoking habit resulted significantly associated ( r = 0.23, p = 0.013; r = 0.33, p = 0.001; r = 0.34, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Assuming mean PPD as dependent variable, multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant association with glucose CV and smoking habits only. Conclusions PD is associated with glucose variability in patients with type 1 diabetes also after adjusting for the main confounders.",

    "abstract": "The impact of Ramadan exposure to Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) pregnancies is not known. We therefore aimed to assess the association of Ramadan with maternal and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with GDM.Retrospective cohort study of 345 Muslim women with singleton pregnancies who attended a major Sydney teaching hospital during the period 1989-2010, was undertaken. Exposure to Ramadan was stratified by the: (1) total pregnancy days exposed to Ramadan, (2) duration (hours) of daily fasting and (3) trimester of exposure. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were examined by exposure status, and never exposed pregnancies were comparator in all three analyses. Fasting status was not recorded.We found no significant effect of Ramadan exposure on mean birthweight, macrosomia and maternal outcomes. However, we found a significant trend for increased neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with increasing Ramadan days exposure and later trimester exposure (ptrend ≤ 0.02 for both), with adjusted OR 3.9 (p=0.03) for those with ≥ 21 days exposure to Ramadan and adjusted OR 4.3 (p=0.04) for third trimester exposure. Conversely longer Ramadan exposure and late trimester exposure were independently associated with a lower prevalence of neonatal hypoglycaemia (adjusted OR 0.4 and 0.3 for ≥ 21 days and third trimester exposure, respectively). Furthermore, neonatal hypoglycaemia decreased for the fasting period of > 15 h group (adjusted OR 0.2, p = 0.01).Ramadan exposure is associated with reduced neonatal hypoglycaemia, with no effect on birthweight, implying more favourable glycaemic control. However, the fourfold excess of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia indicates a need for further study of Ramadan and GDM.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-9 (IL-9) attenuates podocyte injury in experimental kidney disease, but its role in diabetic nephropathy is unknown. We sought to relate urinary IL-9 levels to the release of podocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in youth with type 1 diabetes. We related urinary IL-9 levels to clinical variables and studied interactions between urinary IL-9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) on urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) a functional measure of podocyte injury.We performed an analysis of urine samples and clinical data from a cohort of youth with type 1 diabetes (n = 53). Cytokines were measured using a Luminex platform (Eve Technologies), and nanoscale flow cytometry was employed to quantify urinary podocyte-derived EVs. All urinary measures were normalized to urinary creatinine.Mean age was 14.7 ± 1.6 years, and the mean time from diagnosis was 6.7 ± 2.9 years. Mean HbA1c was 70.3 ± 13.9 mmol/mol, mean ACR was 1.3 ± 1.9 mg/mmol, and mean eGFR was 140.3 ± 32.6 ml/min/1.73 m2. IL-9 was inversely related to podocyte EVs (r = - 0.56, p = 0.003). IL-9 was also inversely related to blood glucose, HbA1C and eGFR (r = - 0.44, p = 0.002; r = - 0.41, p = 0.003; r = - 0.49, p < 0.001, respectively) and positively correlated with systolic BP (r = 0.30, p = 0.04). There was a significant interaction between IL-9, EVs and ACR (p = 0.0143), and the relationship between IL-9 and ACR depended on VEGF (p = 0.0083), TNFα (p = 0.0231) and IL-6 levels (p = 0.0178).IL-9 is associated with podocyte injury in early type 1 diabetes, and there are complex interactions between urinary IL-9, inflammatory cytokines and ACR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim In the pediatric diabetes clinic, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) account for more than 90% of cases, while monogenic forms represent about 6%. Many monogenic diabetes subtypes may respond to therapies other than insulin and have chronic diabetes complication prognosis that is different from T1D. With the aim of providing a better diagnostic pipeline and a tailored care for patients with monogenic diabetes, we set up a monogenic diabetes clinic (MDC). Methods In the first 3 years of activity 97 patients with non-autoimmune forms of hyperglycemia were referred to MDC. Genetic testing was requested for 80 patients and 68 genetic reports were available for review. Results In 58 subjects hyperglycemia was discovered beyond 1 year of age (Group 1) and in 10 before 1 year of age (Group 2). Genetic variants considered causative of hyperglycemia were identified in 25 and 6 patients of Group 1 and 2, respectively, with a pick up rate of 43.1% (25/58) for Group 1 and 60% (6/10) for Group 2 (global pick-up rate: 45.5%; 31/68). When we considered probands of Group 1 with a parental history of hyperglycemia, 58.3% (21/36) had a positive genetic test for GCK or HNF1A genes, while pick-up rate was 18.1% (4/22) in patients with mute family history for diabetes. Specific treatments for each condition were administered in most cases. Conclusion We conclude that MDC may contribute to provide a better diabetes care in the pediatric setting.",

    "abstract": "Normal pregnancy is characterized by changes in lipid metabolism with significant implications for the health of both mother and offspring. When these changes develop into maternal dyslipidemia, a significant association with adverse pregnancy outcomes has been observed, including the development of gestational diabetes (GD), modulation of the inflammatory response, and excessive fetal growth. In the present study, we performed a lipidomic assessment of patients at GD diagnosis (24-28 weeks of gestation) and 12 weeks after diagnosis. We found higher levels of esterified oleic acid in plasma at the time of GD diagnosis in women who subsequently required pharmacological therapy to control blood glucose levels compared to those who did not require additional treatment, suggesting that the measurement of plasma oleic acid might be an additional tool for the early identification of patients with a more severe form of gestational diabetes. Moreover, plasma oleic acid levels showed a positive correlation with fetal growth in the context of adequate glycemic control, supporting a metabolic dysregulation of other pathways whose identification could help clinicians to discriminate different cases within the spectrum of severity of the disease. Finally, the correlation between plasma oleic acid and circulating BAFF levels at the time of diagnosis and 12 weeks later adds a possible mechanism to support the pro-inflammatory and pro-diabetic state in the metabolic set of GD. Overall, these findings strongly support the role of plasma oleic acid as a possible early marker for GD severity stratification during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Objective and easily applicable biomarkers for diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) are warranted. Circulating nerve-specific proteins have emerged as valuable biomarkers for central nervous system disease but few of these have been tested in peripheral neuropathy. Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) is highly expressed in non-myelinating Schwann cells while UCH-L1 is a neuron expressed stress protein not previous analyzed in DPN. In this pilot study, we explore serum GFAP and UCH-L1 levels in patients with/without DPN and controls. Methods Persons with DPN ( n = 28), without DPN ( n = 31), and controls ( n = 30) were evaluated in a cross-sectional design. Sural nerve conduction (velocity and amplitude) was evaluated by NC-stat DPNCheck™ and quantitative sensory testing of cold detection and pain was performed. GFAP and UCH-L1 levels were compared across study groups and the unadjusted correlation with nerve assessments evaluated. Results Serum GFAP were lower in persons with DPN (20.9 ± 10.9 pg/ml) than in persons without DPN (26.2 ± 14.1 pg/ml) ( p = 0.04) or controls (31.7 ± 26.0 pg/ml) ( p = 0.02). GFAP levels were not different in persons without DPN and controls ( p = 0.61). UCH-L1 levels were not different between study groups ( p = 0.48). GFAP levels correlated with cold pain threshold (Rho= − 0.320, p = 0.02) but failed to reach significance for cold detection (Rho= − 0.236, p = 0.09). No correlation was observed between GFAP and nerve amplitude ( p = 0.58) or conductivity ( p = 0.86). Conclusion Serum GFAP levels are reduced in persons with DPN compared to persons without DPN and controls. Reduced serum GFAP levels may be associated with reduced markers of small nerve fiber damage obtained from quantitative sensory testing in people with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim The potential effects of diabetes duration and glycemic control on ejection fraction (EF) in patients with heart failure (HF) remain unclear. We investigated the impact of diabetes duration and glycemic control on ejection fraction (EF), alongside other risk factors, in HF patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Materials and methods This single-center retrospective study included 1265 patients who were admitted and discharged with a diagnosis of HF between January 2010 and January 2022, all of whom had a known diagnosis of T2DM prior to admission. The patients included in the study were divided into two groups: those with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, EF ≤ 40%) and those with or mid-range or preserved ejection fraction (HFmrEF + HFpEF, EF &gt; 40%). Results Among the 1265 patients, 697 had HFrEF. The duration of diabetes was significantly longer (13 vs. 7 years, p &lt; 0.001) and HbA1c levels were higher (8.4 ± 1.6% vs. 7.7 ± 1.5%, p &lt; 0.001) in the HFrEF group. Multivariable analysis identified diabetes duration (OR 2.23, p &lt; 0.001), hypertension (OR:6.62, p &lt; 0.001), and the use of oral antidiabetic agents (OR 0.74, p = 0.042) as independent predictors of reduced EF. Prolonged diabetes duration was associated with a reduction in EF (AUC = 0.780, p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, although glycemic control was poorer in the HFrEF group, it was not an independent predictor of EF. Conclusion Prolonged diabetes duration significantly reduces EF, among HF patients with T2DM, independent of glycemic control and other risk factors. While poor glycemic control was more prevalent in HFrEF patients, it did not independently affect EF.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) worldwide. Macrophages and the complement system have interrelated roles in DN. We aimed to determine associations between macrophage and complement markers with the progression of DN. Methods This retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with sole DN by kidney biopsy. Using immunohistochemistry, CD68 + and CD163 + cells and complement markers were counted in glomerular and tubulointerstitial areas. The primary outcome was evolution to ESKD and/or doubling serum creatinine (SCr). Results Forty-six patients were included. The median SCr at baseline was 2.7 (1.41–3.1) mg/dL. During the median follow-up of 32 months (range 6–54), 50% of patients reached the primary outcome. Most of the clinical and histological findings were comparable between progressors and non-progressors, while progressors had a higher median number of glomerular CD68+ cells and a higher percentage of glomerulosclerosis. After adjustments for age, sex, and SCr, the median glomerular CD68+ cell number was the sole independent predictor of progression. Glomerular C4d was associated with nephrotic-range proteinuria but not with the progression of kidney failure. Conclusions Glomerular CD68+ cell count may serve as a promising predictor of kidney disease progression among patients with DN. Glomerular C4d was associated with nephrotic-range proteinuria but not with the progression of kidney failure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. We aimed to characterize secular trends in diabetes prevalence, control of glucose and associated comorbidities, and medication use. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Series data from 2001 to 2023. We focused on three outcomes: (1) prevalence of diabetes defined by known diagnosis, hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5%, or fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, and among individuals with diabetes (2) control of glucose levels, low-density lipoprotein, and blood pressure and (3) medication therapy. Predictors were cycle (year) and demographics, specifically age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, and household income. Results We included 27,437 participants of whom 3467 had diagnosed diabetes and an additional 1602 had undiagnosed diabetes. Diabetes prevalence increased from 10.0% in 2001–2002 to 15.1% in 2021–2023 and was higher in men versus women, and Hispanic/Latino or non-Hispanic Black vs. non-Hispanic White participants. Glycemic control declined over time, from 61.5 to 44.9% having hemoglobin A1c &lt; 7% in 2001–2002 vs. 2021–2023; control was lower in younger participants and those with lower educational attainment. Lipid control improved over time but remained poor: 73.1% had low-density lipoprotein ≥ 70 mg/dL in 2017–2020, and only half of these individuals were taking a statin. There were no significant changes over time in blood pressure control, with 44–56% having blood pressure ≥ 130/80 mmHg. Other than lower lipid control in women, we did not observe differences in control of lipids or blood pressure, or in medication treatment, based on sex and race/ethnicity. Discussion Diabetes has increased in prevalence from 2001 to 2023 and management of hyperglycemia and associated risk factors remains inadequate.",

In fact, rather than being incidental findings, conditions such as insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and visceral obesity interact with the immune system, amplifying inflammatory circuits and promoting joint and systemic damage. This review delves into the metabolic dimension of PsA, shedding light on how pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokine imbalances reshape glucose and lipid homeostasis. Special attention is given to molecular pathways, such as impaired insulin signaling and altered lipid uptake, that link systemic inflammation to cardiometabolic risk. Furthermore, we examine the impact of these metabolic alterations in clinical practice and how antirheumatic therapies might improve metabolic balance and promote long-term cardiovascular protective effects. By unraveling these interactions, we aim to provide new insights into the clinical management of PsA and underscore the need for integrated therapeutic strategies that address both inflammation and metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim The study aimed to evaluate the rate and causes of major amputation in patients with diabetic foot syndrome. Methods The current study is a retrospective observational study including consecutive patients referred to a tertiary-level diabetic foot service from January 2020 to November 2023 due to a new diabetic foot problem requiring hospital admission. All patients had been managed by a multi-disciplinary diabetic foot team (MDFT) through a pre-set limb salvage protocol including the management of peripheral arterial disease, infection, foot offloading, and comorbidities. At 1 year of follow-up, the following outcomes measures were evaluated: rate of major amputation, clinical characteristics of amputees, and causes of major amputation. Results Overall, 1226 patients referring for a diabetic foot problem and requiring hospitalization were screened for the study. Among them, 30 (2.4%) patients experienced major amputation. Amputees had 69.9±10.7 years, the majority were male (73.3%) with a prevalence of type 2 diabetes (93.3%) and a long diabetes duration (25.2±9.8 years). They showed several comorbidities such as ischaemic heart disease (83.3%), heart failure (46.7%), end-stage-renal-disease (26.7%), and in addition high rate of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (86.7%), infected wounds (98.3%), and osteomyelitis (90%). Major amputation was mainly related to untreatable limb ischemia (failure of revascularization procedure) in 56.7% of cases, calcaneus osteomyelitis and necrotizing fasciitis in 16.7% of cases, and tarsal osteomyelitis in 10% of cases. Conclusions The rate of major amputation was very low in this population managed by a MDFT. PAD was the main cause of major amputation.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between within-person variability in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood pressure (BP) with retinopathy and nephropathy in type 1 diabetes (T1D). This nationwide cohort included 9,358 individuals from the Swedish National Diabetes Register with T1D <5 years at inclusion (1998-2017) and ≥8 years follow-up. Variability in HbA1c, systolic BP (SBP), and diastolic BP (DBP) was calculated as updated SDs. Associations with microvascular complications were analyzed using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. Mean age at inclusion was 14.2 years, mean diabetes duration 1.2 years, and 44% were female. Over 10.7 years' follow-up, retinopathy developed in 33% and nephropathy in 9.3%. SBP variability was significantly associated with pre-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.27) and proliferative retinopathy/ laser photocoagulation (1.23, 1.04-1.45), as well as with any albuminuria (1.15, 1.08-1.23) and macroalbuminuria (1.29, 1.15-1.45). DBP variability was associated with any albuminuria (1.11, 1.03-1.19) and macroalbuminuria (1.28, 1.10-1.50). HbA1c variability was associated with any retinopathy (1.14, 1.08-1.20) and any albuminuria (1.12, 1.03-1.21). Beyond mean levels, higher variability in HbA1c and BP is associated with retinopathy and nephropathy. Stable BP control in patients with established retinopathy may be important to prevent progression to sight-threatening stages.",

Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are among the most important regulators of bone homeostasis and fracture repair but have not been investigated in the pathophysiology of Charcot. The current study aims to address this issue. Sixteen patients diagnosed with active Charcot were treated with total contact cast (TCC) and monitored during 24 months (M) with repeated plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Plasma was sampled at 9 occasions and analyzed for BMP-1, BMP-2, BMP-3, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7 and BMP-9 as well as for basal laboratory data. Fifteen diabetes patients with peripheral neuropathy and fifteen healthy participants without diabetes served as controls. All Charcot patients had pathologically low BMP-2 level at inclusion which remained suppressed throughout the 2-year follow-up as defined by being lower than 2 standard deviations (SD) of BMP-2 in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and in diabetes patients with neuropathy without Charcot (p < 0.002). BMP-2 did not differ between the control groups. BMP-7 in Charcot patients increased significantly 6-12 months following TCC treatment. Other BMPs showed no significant differences between the groups at any point during the follow-up. Low BMP-2 in diabetes patients with neuropathy is associated with increased risk of developing Charcot fractures due to the critical role of BMP-2 for the initiation of bone repair. BMP-7 appears to partly compensate for the lack of response by other osteogenic BMPs during fracture repair in Charcot patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Excess weight is a progressive metabolic epidemic, and inflammation plays an important role in the progression of disease. Insulin resistance (IR) is an important feature of obesity, but it does not reflect systemic inflammation. Currently, there is a lack of effective clinical tools for early risk stratification and intervention in physically active people. Methods This was a prospective cohort of 72,262 overweight but physically active persons in the UK Biobank. The TyG was combined with hsCRP, waist circumference (WC), or body mass index (BMI) as indices of IR. Adjusted Cox regression, interaction tests, restricted cubic splines (RCS) analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Harrell’s C-index were used to examine the relations and time-dependent predictive power. Results During 12.7 years of follow-up, 1,477 participants developed metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). RCS analysis suggested TyG-hsCRP had a nonlinear positive correlations with all-cause mortality. Compared to the lowest quartile group, the corrected hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of new-onset MAFLD in maximum quartile groups for TyG-hsCRP was 1.94(1.62–2.32), for TyG-WC was 1.78(1.44–2.18), for TyG-BMI was 1.36(1.12–1.65), and for TyG was 1.41(1.15–1.72). The relation between C-index of TyG-hsCRP and MAFLD was higher than that of other TyG indices. Similar results were observed in all-cause mortality. Conclusion TyG-hsCRP is superior to other indices for identifying risk of MAFLD and all-cause mortality in overweight but physically active people. Our findings suggest the importance of inflammatory metabolism and provide evidence for effectively early anti-inflammatory treatments.",

    "abstract": "Early exit from the workforce has been proposed to be one of the unfavorable consequences of diabetes. We examined whether early exit from the workforce differed between persons who were and were not diagnosed with diabetes during their work career. The cohort included 12,726 individuals of the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study, born between 1934 and 1944. Using data from nationwide registers, the cohort was followed up from early adulthood until they transitioned into retirement or died. Work-loss years were estimated using the restricted mean work years method. During a follow-up of 382,328 person-years for men and 349 894 for women, 36.8% transitioned into old age pension and 63.2% exited workforce early. Among men, 40.5% of those with and 32.8% of those without diabetes transitioned into old age pension (p=0.003). The corresponding numbers for women were 48.6% and 40.4% (p = 0.013), respectively. Mean age at exit from the workforce was 60.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.6 to 60.7) years among men with diabetes and 57.6 (95% CI, 57.2 to 58.0) years among men without diabetes (p = 0.016). Among women, corresponding ages were 61.4 (95% CI, 60.8 to 61.9) years for those with diabetes and 59.5 (95% CI, 59.3 to 59.7) years for those without diabetes (p < 0.001). The difference in mean restricted work-loss years according to diabetes was 2.5 (95% CI 0.5 to 4.6) for men and 1.9 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.8) for women. Among individuals followed up throughout their work career, those with a diabetes diagnosis exited the workforce approximately two years later compared to those without diabetes.",

This study aimed to explore the role of VIM-AS1 in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods Gene expression levels in both human specimens and in vitro cultivated cells were determined by qPCR and western blot. Overexpression experiments were performed to analyze gene interactions. Cell apoptosis after transfections was detected by cell apoptosis assay. Results We found that VIM-AS1 was significantly downregulated in T2D patients in comparison with that in healthy controls. Specifically, the expression levels of VIM-AS1 were lowest among T2D patients complicated with DR. Bioinformatics analysis showed that VIM-AS1 can interact with microRNA 29 (miR-29), which is a critical player in high glucose-induced apoptosis of human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEs). Dual-luciferase assay also revealed the direct interaction between them. High glucose treatment led to upregulated miR-29 and downregulated VIM-AS1. However, overexpression of VIM-AS1 and miR-29 did not affect the expression of each other. Cell apoptosis analysis showed that overexpression of VIM-AS1 reduced the enhancing effects of miR-29 overexpression on RPEs cell proliferation. Conclusions Therefore, VIM-AS1 may sponge miR-29 to participate in DR.",

Methods We included 79,067 T1D patients aged 6–20 years, with at least six months of diabetes duration, and treatment data between 1995 and 2019 were documented in the diabetes patient follow-up registry. We categorized patients into four groups: T1D only ( n = 73,699), T1 + CD ( n = 3379), T1D + depression ( n = 1877), or T1D + CD + depression ( n = 112). Results CD and depression were significantly associated (adjusted OR: 1.25 [1.03–1.53]). Females were more frequent in both the depression and the CD group compared with the T1D only group. Insulin pumps were used more frequently in T1D + CD and T1D + depression compared with T1D only (both p &lt; .001). HbA1c was higher in T1D + depression (9.0% [8.9–9.0]), T1D + CD + depression (8.9% [8.6–9.2]), both compared with T1D only (8.2% [8.2–8.2], all p &lt; .001). We found comorbid autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, and eating disorders more frequently in the T1D + CD + depression group compared with T1D only (all p &lt; .001). Conclusions CD and depression are associated in young T1D patients. The double load of T1D and CD may lead to an increased risk for depression. Depression was associated with additional psychological and neurological comorbidities. Aside from imperative CD screening after T1D diagnosis and regular intervals, depression screening might be helpful in routine care, especially in patients with diagnosed CD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Management of gestational diabetes (GDM) is currently changing toward a more personalized approach. There is a growing number of GDM patients requiring only a single dose of basal insulin at night to achieve glucose control. Well-known risk factors like obesity, parity and family history have been associated with GDM treatment requirements. Sleep quality and lifestyle factors interfering with the circadian rhythm are known to affect glucose metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of such lifestyle factors on insulin requirement in GDM patients, in particular on long-acting insulin to control fasting glucose levels. Research design and methods A total of 805 patients treated for GDM between 2012 and 2016 received a study questionnaire on lifestyle conditions. Sleep quality and work condition categories were used for subgroup analysis. Independent effects on treatment approaches were evaluated using multivariate regression. Results In total, 235 (29.2%) questionnaires returned. Women reporting poor sleep conditions had higher pre-pregnancy weight and BMI, heavier newborns, more large for gestational age newborns and higher rates of hyperbilirubinemia. Treatment requirements were related to sleep and work condition categories. Multivariate regression for ‘Basal’ insulin-only treatment revealed an adjOR 3.4 (CI 1.23–9.40, p &lt; 0.05) for unfavorable work conditions and adjOR 4.3 (CI 1.28–14.50, p &lt; 0.05) for living with children. Conclusions Our findings suggest that external stressors like unfavorable work conditions and living with children are independently associated with the necessity of long-acting insulin at night in GDM patients. Thus, fasting glucose levels of pregnant women presenting with such lifestyle conditions may be subject to close monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy with or without continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on neonatal outcomes and glycemic outcomes of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1D), living in Poland, were assessed.This prospective observational study enrolled women with T1D (N = 481, aged 18-45 years) who were pregnant or planned pregnancy. All used CSII therapy and a subset used CGM with CSII (CSII + CGM). Neonatal outcomes (e.g., rate of large for gestational age [LGA] delivery [birth weight > 90th percentile]) and maternal glycemia (e.g., HbA1c and percentage of time at sensor glucose ranges) were evaluated.Overall HbA1c at trimesters 1, 2, and 3 was 6.8 ± 1.1% (50.9 ± 12.3 mmol/mol, N = 354), 5.8 ± 0.7% (40.1 ± 8.0 mmol/mol, N = 318), and 5.9 ± 0.7% (41.4 ± 8.0 mmol/mol, N = 255), respectively. A HbA1c target of < 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) at each trimester was achieved by 20.9% (74/354), 65.1% (207/318), and 58.0% (148/255), respectively. For women using CSII + CGM versus CSII only, HbA1c levels at trimesters 1, 2, and 3 were 6.5 ± 0.9% versus 7.1 ± 1.3% (47.8 ± 9.7 mmol/mol versus 54.3 ± 14.0 mmol/mol, p < 0.0001), 5.7 ± 0.6% versus 6.0 ± 0.9% (38.9 ± 6.5 mmol/mol versus 41.6 ± 9.3 mmol/mol, p = 0.0122), and 5.8 ± 0.6% versus 6.1 ± 0.8% (40.3 ± 6.9 mmol/mol versus 42.9 ± 9.1 mmol/mol, p = 0.0117), respectively. For the overall, CSII only, and CSII + CGM groups, rates of LGA delivery were 22.7% (74/326), 24.6% (34/138), and 21.3% (40/188), respectively.Observational assessment of women with T1D using CSII therapy demonstrated low HbA1c throughout pregnancy and low rates of LGA. The addition of CGM to CSII therapy compared to CSII therapy alone was associated with some improved maternal glycemic and neonatal outcomes.NCT01779141 (January 2013).",

However, its use in gestational diabetes (GDM) has been critically discussed. Inaccuracy and missing recommendations for target values are the main arguments against the use of FGM in GDM. To date, there is a lack of data to justify routine use of FGM in GDM pregnancies. Consequently, this new technology has been withheld from GDM-patients. Aim of our pilot study was to analyze the impact of FGM use on pregnancy outcomes, patient's satisfaction and to confirm the safe use in GDM pregnancies.Cohort study of 37 FGM-managed GDM pregnancies compared with 74 matched women using self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Group comparison using nonparametric testing concerning patients characteristic and perinatal outcome focusing on adverse outcomes (preeclampsia, preterm delivery, large for gestational age, C-sections, neonatal intensive care unit admission, hyperbilirubinemia and hypoglycemia). Evaluation of patient's treatment satisfaction using the \"Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire change\" (DTSQc) and patient interviews.No significant differences in patient's characteristics despite gestational age at diagnosis (FGM with 20 vs. SMBG with 25 weeks). No difference in gestational weight gain, HbA1c progression and perinatal outcome. Treatment satisfaction obtained by the DTSQc revealed a high level of satisfaction with FGM use.FGM use was well accepted and did not affect perinatal outcome. Use of FGM during pregnancy is safe and non-inferior to the management with SBGM. FGM should be considered as an option in the management of GDM patients.",

However, limited data are available on the long-term outcomes of patients on HCL with telemedicine follow-up. Methods A prospective observational cohort study including T1D patients, who were upgrading to HCL system. Virtual training and follow-up were done through telemedicine. CGM data were analyzed to compare the baseline time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR), glycemic variability and auto mode (AM), with measurements performed at 3, 6 and 12 months. Results 134 patients were included with baseline A1c 7.6% ± 1.1. 40.5% had a severe hypoglycemia event in the last year. Baseline TIR, measured two weeks after starting AM was 78.6 ± 9.94%. No changes were evident at three (Mean difference − 0.15;CI-2.47,2.17; p = 0.96), six (MD-1.09;CI-3.42,1.24; p = 0.12) and 12 months (MD-1.30;CI-3.64,1.04; p = 0.08). No significant changes were found in TBR or glycemic variability throughout the follow-up. Use of AM was 85.6 ± 17.5% and percentage of use of sensor was 88.75 ± 9.5% at 12 months. No severe hypoglycemic (SH) events were reported. Conclusions HCL systems allow to improve TIR, TBR and glycemic variability safely, early and sustained up to 1 year of follow-up in patients with T1D and high risk of hypoglycemia followed through telemedicine.",

    "abstract": "To describe the development of the AWARE App, a novel web application for the rapid assessment of cardiovascular risk in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. We also tested the feasibility of using this App in clinical practice.Based on 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for the Study of Diabetes criteria for cardiovascular risk stratification in T2DM, the AWARE App classifies patients into very high (VHCVR), high (HCVR) and moderate (MCVR) cardiovascular risk categories. In this retrospective clinical study, we employed the App to assess the cardiovascular risk of T2DM patients, while also collecting data about current glycaemic control and pharmacological treatment.2243 T2DM consecutive patients were evaluated. 72.2% of the patients were VHCVR, 8.9% were HCVR, 0.8% were MCVR while 18.2% did not fit into any of the risk categories and were classified as \"moderate-to-high\" (MHCVR). Compared with the other groups, patients with VHCVD were more frequently ≥ 65 years old (68.9%), with a longer disease duration (≥ 10 years [56.8%]), a history of cardiovascular disease (41.4%), organ damage (35.5%) and a higher numbers of cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with MHCVD generally had disease duration < 10 years (96%), younger age (50-60 years [55%]), no history of cardiovascular disease, no organ damage, and 1-2 cardiovascular risk factors (89%). Novel drugs such as Glucagon Like Peptyde 1 Receptor Agonists or Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 2 inhibitors were prescribed only to 26.3% of the patients with VHCVR and to 24.7% of those with HCVR. Glycaemic control was unsatisfactory in this patients population (HbA1c 7.5 ± 3.4% [58.7 ± 13.4 mmol/mol]).The AWARE App proved to be a practical tool for cardiovascular risk stratification of T2DM patients in real-world clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between oral health status and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adults. Studies on associations between childhood oral health and T2D in adulthood are lacking. Methods This is a nationwide Danish registry-based cohort study of individuals born between 1963 and 1972, having at least one registration in the National Child Odontology Registry between 1972 and 1987 (n = 627,758). Follow-up lasted from 1995 to 2018. Main exposure variables were the highest achieved levels of dental caries and gingivitis between 1972 and 1987. The outcome was T2D diagnosis during follow-up. Data was analyzed using Cox-regression, stratified on sex, with age as the underlying timescale and highest achieved level of education between age 25–30 years as Cox-strata. Main analyses were conducted with and without age-restrictions (T2D diagnosis before/after age 40). Results Compared to lowest-level references, high levels of gingivitis associated with increased hazard ratios (HRs) of T2D in both males (HR [95% confidence interval]: 1.59 [1.47; 1.72]) and females (1.87 [1.68; 2.08]), as did severe dental caries (males: (1.15 [1.04; 1.27], in females: 1.19 [1.06; 1.35]). Below age 40, gingivitis associated with increased HRs in males (1.84 ([1.58; 2.15]) and females (1.94 [1.63; 2.30]). Above age 40, both exposures displayed higher HRs in males (high gingivitis: 1.52 [1.39; 1.66] vs. severe caries: 1.23 [1.09; 1.38]) and females (1.83 [1.59; 2.10] vs. 1.37 [1.17; 1.59]). Conclusions Data suggest an association between childhood dental caries and gingivitis with risk of receiving a T2D diagnosis in adulthood. However, results are affected by residual confounding warranting further studies.",

Methods Fifty-one participants with T2D, who underwent neurological assessment for DN were recruited. We quantified the mRNA levels of SIRT1 and VDR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, we analysed the methylation status and the rs2228570 genetic variant of VDR promoter. Results Patients with DN ( n = 32) showed lower expression of SIRT1 (p corr =0.018) and VDR (p corr =0.009), compared to those without DN. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the mRNA levels of SIRT1 and VDR ( p = 0.01). The expression levels of these genes negatively correlated with the score based on cardiovascular reflex tests (CARTs score). Moreover, the variant allele of rs2228570 in the VDR gene was associated with higher expression of this gene compared to the wild-type allele ( p = 0.003). Conclusion In patients with DN, both SIRT1 and VDR expression levels are reduced and interrelated. Low VDR expression levels could negatively affect SIRT1 transcription, thus influencing all the most pathogenetic pathways of DN regulated by this protein.",

We explored whether attending an integrated nephrology and diabetology (NPD) outpatient service can improve clinical outcomes and adherence to treatment guidelines for diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Methods We retrospectively included 110 DKD patients (aged 71.1 ± 10.1 years; 74.5% males) having attended the NPD outpatient service of CTO Hospital (Rome) between June and November 2023. Age- and gender-matched control group included DKD patients attending regular Diabetology outpatient service. Drugs prescriptions, clinical and biochemical parameters related to routine evaluation of DKD were collected at first and 6-months control visit. Results This DKD population was made of 28.2% of patients with urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) &gt; 30 mg/gr, 33.6% with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 60 ml/min, 38.2% with both abnormalities. Proportion of patients prescribed with most recent anti-diabetic medications significantly increased after attending the NPD service (for SGLT-2 inhibitors, 54.5 vs. 25.5%, p &lt; 0.01; for GLP1-R agonists, 28.3 vs. 21.8%, p = 0.01), as well as for statins ( p &lt; 0.01) and calcium channel-blockers ( p = 0.01). During the same observation period we registered significant reduction in LDL cholesterol ( p = 0.01) and UACR levels ( p = 0.007), with a trend toward improvement in HbA1c and eGFR. Conversely, no significant differences in drugs prescriptions were reported in the control group, except for SGLT-2 inhibitors. Conclusions Enhanced real-time interaction and collaborative decision-making in an outpatient setting that integrates both diabetology and nephrology expertise can lead to better clinical outcomes and greater adherence to DKD management guidelines, ultimately providing a more comprehensive strategy for cardio-renal risk reduction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) imposes a disproportionate burden on the South Asian population. Their phenotype is characterized by heightened insulin resistance, even in individuals without overt T2D. Commonly used screening tools underestimate the T2D incidence in this population. The Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) are indicators of insulin resistance; however, their predictive value for the development of T2D remains unexplored. Methods Among 698 initially enrolled healthy South Asian adults aged 30 to 65 in a Rotterdam-based cardiovascular disease prevention study, 270 participants were included after a 14-year follow-up. At baseline, an extensive history, physical examination, and metabolic screening were taken. A follow-up assessment of incident T2D was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression models calculated odds ratios (ORs) for MetS, its components, and HOMA-IR and adjusted for confounders. Results 33 (12.2%) of participants developed T2D. The presence of MetS at baseline showed an adjusted OR of 2.6, (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–5.7, p = 0.02) for incident T2D. Fasting plasma glucose was the most strongly associated component of MetS (OR 3.0, CI 1.1–8.6, p = 0.04) HOMA-IR was also associated and showed an OR of 1.2 per point increase (CI 1.0–1.4, p=0.05). Conclusions MetS and FPG were the most important predictors of T2D development in this South Asian cohort. These results underscore the value of diverse variables in T2D detection and give insight into which screening tools for T2D prediction should be used in this high-risk population.",

Research design and methods Adult patients ( n = 120) with long-standing T1D (≥ 10 years) and healthy controls (HC) ( n = 50) were recruited at Uppsala University Hospital. Residual beta-cell function was determined with an ultrasensitive C-peptide ELISA under fasting conditions. T1D patients were divided into two groups (C-peptide positive vs. C-peptide negative). Using the OLINK Explore Inflammation proximity extension assay (PEA), 368 circulating immunological and inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed in plasma. Results The three groups could not be distinguished by principal component analysis and when correcting for multiple testing we found no differences in circulating biomarkers. However, based on uncorrected p-values there were six biomarkers that were different when comparing all T1D patients with HC and eight markers that were different when comparing C-peptide positive vs. negative T1D patients. Conclusion A wide inflammatory assay analysis cannot distinguish patients with longstanding T1D and remaining C-peptide from patients with a complete loss of C-peptide nor from HC.",

Materials and methods Prospective single-center observational study enrolling 40 critically ill patients. For four consecutive days, we measured three consecutive interstitial FSL-CGM-derived glucose levels, along with one arterial and venous blood gas analysis and a capillary-derived blood glucose level, obtaining a total of 480 FSL-CGM-derived glucose measurements and 160 measurements from arterial and venous blood gas analysis and from capillary glucose. Results The mean blood glucose levels in the three daily timepoints from FSL-CGM were 130 ± 35, 131 ± 35 and 131 ± 35 mg/dL ( p = 0.660). The Bland-Altman analysis comparing arterial BGA- and FSL-CGM-derived blood glucose levels had a bias of 10.3 mg/dL with limits of agreement from − 27.2 to 47.7. The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between FSL-CGM and arterial blood gas analysis was 12 ± 10%. The Clarke, Parkes and Surveillance error grid analyses comparing arterial BGA- and FSL-CGM-derived blood glucose levels showed a good clinical accuracy. The presence of diabetes did not influence analytical accuracy, while the use of vasopressors was associated with a higher MARD. Conclusions FSL-CGM demonstrated reproducibility and reliable analytical and clinical accuracy in critically ill patients, without difference between diabetic and non-diabetic patients, over a period of up to 96 h (4 days).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims The International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes (GDM) were widely implemented in Australia, despite limited evidence of better pregnancy outcomes compared to the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society 1998 (ADIPS1998) criteria. We aimed to evaluate the effect of treatment on pregnancy outcomes for women with ‘mild’ GDM, defined as GDM diagnosed by one, but not both, sets of criteria. Methods This multicentre, retrospective cohort study included 17,512 pregnant women in six neighbouring tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia, during 2016–2017, all of whom were screened for GDM using a three-point 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Three hospitals diagnosed and treated GDM according to ADIPS1998 criteria, and three according to IADPSG criteria. For women with ‘mild’ GDM, we evaluated the effect of treatment versus no treatment on pregnancy outcomes. The primary outcome was large for gestational age. Secondary outcomes were small for gestational age, induction of labour, caesarean section, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia. Results 2320 (13.2%) pregnant women had ‘mild’ GDM. Treatment of women with IADPSG-only GDM (i.e. fasting glucose 5.1–5.4 mmol/L (91–97 mg/dL) and/or 1-hour glucose ≥ 10.0 mmol/L (≥ 180 mg/dL)) was associated with less large for gestational age infants than no treatment (RR 0.66, 95%CI 0.49–0.88, p = 0.004) but more induction of labour (RR 1.55, 95%CI 1.03–2.34, p = 0.032). Treatment of women with ADIPS1998-only GDM (i.e. 2-hour glucose 8.0-8.4 mmol/L (144–151 mg/dL)) did not significantly change pregnancy outcomes compared with no treatment. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of treating even mild IADPSG-GDM to improve pregnancy outcomes.",

Methods A preplanned secondary analysis of the CopenFast trial including women with T1D using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), primarily intermittently scanned CGM, routinely. Pregnancy and post-delivery outcomes were compared between insulin pump users and MDI users. Insulin pump settings during pregnancy and post-delivery were compared to pre-pregnancy. Results Of 141 women, 39 used non-automated insulin pumps and 102 used MDI. Median diabetes duration was 17 (IQR 12–20) vs. 14 (8–21) years ( P = 0.12). HbA 1c was 48 (44–53) mmol/mol vs. 47 (42–53) at 9 weeks ( P = 0.65) and 43 (40–46) vs. 43 (39–46) at 35 weeks ( P = 0.53). Mean sensor glucose decreased from ~ 7.0 mmol/l at 9 weeks to 6.3 mmol/l at 33 weeks in both groups. Preterm delivery (&lt; 37 weeks) was more common with insulin pumps (25.9% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.01), as was caesarean section (59% vs. 40%, P = 0.04), which was independent of diabetes duration, age and microvascular complications. At 1 and 3 months post-delivery, maternal and infant outcomes, including breastfeeding, were similar between groups. In insulin pump users, basal insulin rates were ~ 37% higher, and carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios ~ 61% lower at 33 weeks while basal insulin rates were ~ 20% lower, and carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios were similar 3 months post-delivery, compared to pre-pregnancy. Conclusion Despite routine use of CGM and similar glycaemic control, non-automated insulin pump users did not achieve improved pregnancy outcomes compared to MDI users.",

It aims to identify factors influencing adoption and explore perceived benefits and barriers to using DHS, focusing on person-important outcomes such as physical health, mental burden, and access to care. The primary objective of this feasibility study was to assess the intervention acceptability, feasibility, and app usability. The secondary aim is to explore preliminary intervention effects. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in France from April to July 2022. A total of 301 PwD (149 with type 1 diabetes [T1D], 152 with type 2 diabetes [T2D]) completed the study. The survey assessed the use of three DHS categories: information/education (DHS1), self-management support (DHS2), and data-sharing/collaborative care (DHS3). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of DHS use, including demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and medical variables. DHS1 was the most commonly used category, followed by DHS2 and DHS3. PwD with T1D were more likely to use multiple DHS. Type of diabetes and perceived health status were the strongest predictors of DHS use. Surprisingly, people in poorer health were less likely to use DHS despite potentially benefiting most from them. DHS-naïve individuals expected more benefits but reported greater concerns, especially about information overload and data security. These concerns were stronger than the perceived benefits. For example, concerns about data security reduced the likelihood of using DHS2 and DHS3 by up to 89%. The study highlights disparities in DHS adoption and the critical role of perceived barriers. Addressing these concerns-particularly among PwD in poorer health-and aligning DHS with outcomes that matter to patients may improve equitable adoption and diabetes care.",

Educational interventions, including traditional education, psychoeducational, and psychosocial programs, are increasingly recognized as supporting self-care and promoting psychological well-being. This scoping review aims to systematically map the existing literature on educational programs for individuals with T1DM, with a specific focus on their impact on mental health outcomes. The review was conducted according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and guided by the Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework. A comprehensive search was performed across six major biomedical databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO), including studies that examined educational interventions addressing mental health in individuals with T1DM. A total of 18 studies were included, covering a range of educational interventions, such as digital tools, psychological therapies (e.g., ACT, CBT), and self-care interventions, most of which were delivered by multidisciplinary teams. Many interventions demonstrated positive effects on mental health, including reduced anxiety, enhanced mood, and improved self-management. Key facilitators included professional support, peer involvement, and the integration of psychological components. Barriers included high dropout rates and limited tailoring to age-specific needs. Educational interventions can positively influence mental health outcomes in individuals with T1DM. However, the literature remains fragmented, and program effectiveness varies. There is a pressing need for more flexible, personalized, and age-sensitive educational interventions that incorporate emotional and psychological support and address implementation challenges.",

However, its utility in individuals with altered glucose tolerance remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between UHR and insulin sensitivity in two independent cohorts. Sample 1 (n = 1555) from the CATAMERI study, was stratified based on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results, and Sample 2 (n = 332) from the EUGENE2 project, with insulin sensitivity measured via euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. In Sample 1, UHR showed positive correlations with BMI, triglycerides, 2-hour plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, fasting plasma insulin (p < 0.0001 for all) and with HbA1c (p < 0.001), and negative correlations with Matsuda index (p < 0.0001) and total cholesterol (p = 0.019). Multivariable linear regression identified HOMA-IR (β = 0.100), Matsuda index (β=-0.146), InsAUC30/GluAUC30 (β = 0.120), and Stumvoll 1st-phase insulin secretion (β = 0.121) as independent UHR predictors. In Sample 2, bivariate analyses, adjusted for age, sex, and BMI, confirmed positive correlations between UHR and HbA1c (p < 0.001), 2-hour post-load glucose (p = 0.001), BMI, triglycerides, and fasting insulin (p < 0.0001 for all) and a negative correlation with Clamp M (glucose disposal, p = 0.0003). Finally, multivariable regression of Clamp M variability (adjusted for age, sex, and BMI) demonstrated significant negative associations with UHR (β= -0.230) and BMI (β= -0.375). These findings suggest that UHR, derived easily and inexpensively from routine clinical measurements, is a promising indicator of metabolic risk in individuals without diabetes. Its accessibility positions it as a potential tool for early diabetes prevention strategies, potentially reducing reliance on the OGTT.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among older adults represents a major public health concern, given its association with accelerated cognitive decline and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Several diabetes-related mechanisms, including chronic hyperglycaemia, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and insulin resistance in the brain, negatively impact key cognitive domains, including memory and executive functions. These neuropathophysiological alterations are also linked to structural brain changes, contributing to vulnerability to dementia. This narrative review examines both established and emerging strategies aimed at counteracting the cognitive impact of T2D in aging populations. Traditional interventions, especially structured physical activity programs, have consistently demonstrated benefits for global cognitive functioning. In parallel, new pharmacological treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide), not only improve glycemic control but may also exert neuroprotective effects. Multidomain approaches integrating metabolic management, nutritional optimization, physical exercise, and social engagement, such as those tested in the J-MIND-Diabetes study, have yielded promising outcomes in preserving cognitive functions. We argue that combining pharmacological and behavioral strategies holds significant potential for supporting cognitive health in elderly individuals with T2D. Such multimodal interventions may enhance resilience to cognitive decline, improve quality of life, and promote healthy brain aging in this at-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Cystatin C is a marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Its level is influenced, among the others, by CRP whose concentration is decreased in HNF1A-MODY. We hypothesized that cystatin C level might be altered in HNF1A-MODY. We aimed to evaluate cystatin C in HNF1A-MODY both as a diagnostic marker and as a method of assessing GFR. We initially examined 51 HNF1A-MODY patients, 56 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), 39 with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and 43 non-diabetic individuals (ND) from Poland. Subjects from two UK centres were used as replication panels: including 215 HNF1A-MODY, 203 T2DM, 39 HNF4A-MODY, 170 GCK-MODY, 17 HNF1B-MODY and 58 T1DM patients. The data were analysed with additive models, adjusting for gender, age, BMI and estimated GFR (creatinine). In the Polish subjects, adjusted cystatin C level in HNF1A-MODY was lower compared with T1DM, T2DM and ND (p < 0.05). Additionally, cystatin C-based GFR was higher than that calculated from creatinine level (p < 0.0001) in HNF1A-MODY, while the two GFR estimates were similar or cystatin C-based lower in the other groups. In the UK subjects, there were no differences in cystatin C between HNF1A-MODY and the other diabetic subgroups, except HNF1B-MODY. In UK HNF1A-MODY, cystatin C-based GFR estimate was higher than the creatinine-based one (p < 0.0001). Concluding, we could not confirm our hypothesis (supported by the Polish results) that cystatin C level is altered by HNF1A mutations; thus, it cannot be used as a biomarker for HNF1A-MODY. In HNF1A-MODY, the cystatin C-based GFR estimate is higher than the creatinine-based one.",

    "abstract": "The zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) has been suggested as a suitable target for non-invasive visualization of the functional pancreatic beta cell mass, due to both its pancreatic beta cell restricted expression and tight involvement in insulin secretion. In order to examine the potential of ZnT8 as a surrogate target for beta cell mass, we performed mRNA transcription analysis in pancreatic compartments. A novel ZnT8 targeting antibody fragment Ab31 was radiolabeled with iodine-125, and evaluated by in vitro autoradiography in insulinoma and pancreas as well as by in vivo biodistribution. The evaluation was performed in a direct comparison with radio-iodinated Exendin-4. Transcription of the ZnT8 mRNA was higher in islets of Langerhans compared to exocrine tissue. Ab31 targeted ZnT8 in the cytosol and on the plasma membrane with 108 nM affinity. Ab31 was successfully radiolabeled with iodine-125 with high yield and > 95% purity. [125I]Ab31 binding to insulinoma and pancreas was higher than for [125I]Exendin-4, but could only by partially competed away by 200 nM Ab31 in excess. The in vivo uptake of [125I]Ab31 was higher than [125I]Exendin-4 in most tissues, mainly due to slower clearance from blood. We report a first-in-class ZnT8 imaging ligand for pancreatic imaging. Development with respect to ligand miniaturization and radionuclide selection is required for further progress. Transcription analysis indicates ZnT8 as a suitable target for visualization of the human endocrine pancreas.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus affects about 6% of the world's population, and the chronic complications of the disease may result in macro- and micro-vascular changes. The purpose of the current study was to shed light on visual cortical oxygenation in diabetic individuals. We then aimed to compare the haemodynamic response (HDR) to visual stimulation with glycaemic control, given the likelihood of diabetic individuals suffering from such macro- and micro-vascular insult.Thirty participants took part in this explorative study, fifteen of whom had diabetes and fifteen of whom were non-diabetic controls. The HDR, measured as concentrations of oxyhaemoglobin [HbO] and deoxyhaemoglobin [HbR], to visual stimulation was recorded over the primary visual cortex (V1) using a dual-channel oximeter. The stimulus comprised a pattern-reversal checkerboard presented in a block design. Participants' mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level (± SD) was 7.2 ± 0.6% in the diabetic group and 5.5 ± 0.4% in the non-diabetic group. Raw haemodynamic data were normalised to baseline, and the last 15 s of data from each 'stimulus on' and 'stimulus off' condition were averaged over seven duty cycles for each participant.There were statistically significant differences in ∆[HbO] and ∆[HbR] to visual stimulation between diabetic and non-diabetic groups (p < 0.05). In the diabetic group, individuals with type 1 diabetes displayed an increased [HbO] (p < 0.01) and decreased [HbR] (p < 0.05) compared to their type 2 counterparts. There was also a linear relationship between both ∆[HbO] and ∆[HbR] as a function of HbA1c level (p < 0.0005).Our findings suggest that fNIRS can be used as a quantitative measure of cortical oxygenation in diabetes. Diabetic individuals have a larger HDR to visual stimulation compared to non-diabetic individuals. This increase in ∆[HbO] and decrease in ∆[HbR] appears to be correlated with HbA1c level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Although risk scores to predict type 2 diabetes exist, cost-effectiveness of risk thresholds to target prevention interventions are unknown. We applied cost-effectiveness analysis to identify optimal thresholds of predicted risk to target a low-cost community-based intervention in the USA. Methods We used a validated Markov-based type 2 diabetes simulation model to evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of alternative thresholds of diabetes risk. Population characteristics for the model were obtained from NHANES 2001–2004 and incidence rates and performance of two noninvasive diabetes risk scores (German diabetes risk score, GDRS, and ARIC 2009 score) were determined in the ARIC and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for increasing risk score thresholds. Two scenarios were assumed: 1-stage (risk score only) and 2-stage (risk score plus fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test (threshold 100 mg/dl) in the high-risk group). Results In ARIC and CHS combined, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the GDRS and the ARIC 2009 score were 0.691 (0.677–0.704) and 0.720 (0.707–0.732), respectively. The optimal threshold of predicted diabetes risk (ICER &lt; $50,000/QALY gained in case of intervention in those above the threshold) was 7% for the GDRS and 9% for the ARIC 2009 score. In the 2-stage scenario, ICERs for all cutoffs ≥ 5% were below $50,000/QALY gained. Conclusions Intervening in those with ≥ 7% diabetes risk based on the GDRS or ≥ 9% on the ARIC 2009 score would be cost-effective. A risk score threshold ≥ 5% together with elevated FPG would also allow targeting interventions cost-effectively.",

    "abstract": "Current guidelines suggest the use of low doses of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) in primary prevention. However, the evidences demonstrating the beneficial effect of ASA in primary prevention are conflicting. In this pilot study, we evaluated in a group of diabetic patients, in primary prevention, the impact of ASA treatment on oxidative stress and vascular function. We enrolled 22 newly diagnosed diabetic patients, without any previous clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease, to receive, in primary prevention, ASA (100 mg/daily). We tested, in basal condition, after 4 weeks of ASA administration and after 4 weeks of pharmacological washout, the impact of ASA treatment on endothelial function, assessed by a semipletysmographic method, measuring the main oxidative stress parameters related to it. As expected, after 4 weeks of treatment, ASA induced a significant reduction of plasma thromboxane-A2, as a consequence of cyclooxygenase-1 inhibition. By contrast, ASA significantly increased the plasma and urine 8-iso-PGF2α, a well-known prothrombotic molecule, parallel to an increase of plasma NOX2 levels. The enhancement of this oxidative pathway is associated with a significant impairment of endothelial vasodilation, assessed by reactive hyperemia index (RHI). The pharmacological washout reverted all parameters to basal condition. Our findings suggest that ASA utilization for primary prevention in diabetic patients causes a significant increase of oxidative stress burden impairing the vascular function. Present data, if confirmed on a larger population, could permanently discourage the use of the ASA for the primary prevention in patients with DM.",

Methods This is a population-based observational cohort study including all 2347 Finnish women without previously diagnosed diabetes, aged ≥ 20 years from the city of Vantaa, Finland, who gave birth to their first and second child between 2009 and 2015. National registries provided data on study participants. We divided the population into four groups according to the presence of GDM in the two pregnancies (GDM−/−, n = 1820; GDM−/+, n = 223; GDM+/−, n = 113; GDM+/+, n = 191). Results The occurrence of GDM in the first pregnancy was 13.0% ( n = 304) and 17.6% ( n = 414) in the second. The recurrence rate of GDM was 62.8%. The four groups did not differ in relation to educational attainment ( p = 0.11). In multinomial regression analysis, educational attainment protected from GDM in the second pregnancy [relative risk ratio 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86–0.99) per year of schooling for being GDM−/+ compared with GDM−/−]. In multivariate logistics models, prepregnancy body mass index at the first pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) 1.53 per 1-standard deviation (SD) (95% CI 1.22–1.91)], first-born birth weight z -score [OR 1.30 per 1-SD (95% CI 1.00–1.67)], and inter-pregnancy weight change [OR 1.66 per 1-SD (95% CI 1.27–2.16)], but not educational attainment, predicted recurrence of GDM. Conclusions The recurrence rate of GDM was high. Education protected from novel GDM in the second pregnancy, but was not associated with GDM recurrence.",

Methods Data from adult individuals with type 1 diabetes without evidence of diabetic kidney disease or macrovascular complications, participating in the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study, were included. Based on a questionnaire, weekly LTPA as metabolic equivalent of task hour was calculated. Activity levels (inactive, moderately active, active), weekly frequencies (&lt; 1, 1–2, &gt; 2), intensities (low, moderate, high), and single session durations (&lt; 30, 31–60, &gt; 60 min) were assessed. Depressive symptomatology was evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We calculated a continuous BDI score and divided participants into those with (BDI score ≥ 16) and without (BDI score &lt; 16) symptoms of depression. For sensitivity analyses, we additionally defined symptoms of depression with antidepressant agent purchases within a year from the study visit. Results Of the 1339 participants (41.7% men, median age 41 years), 150 (11.2%) reported symptoms of depression. After adjustments, both higher BDI scores and depressive symptomatology were associated with more inactive lifestyle, and lower frequency and intensity of the LTPA. The BDI score was additionally associated with shorter single session duration. For antidepressant purchases, lower odds were observed in those with higher intensity and longer single session duration of LTPA. Conclusions Depressive mood is harmfully related to LTPA in type 1 diabetes. In order to improve the long-term health of individuals with type 1 diabetes, efforts to increase both mental well-being and physical activity should be taken.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its related factors are affected by diabetes type (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [LADA], type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM], type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]).LADA patients were matched for age (± 2 years) and sex to T1DM (1:1) and T2DM (1:2) patients. Retrieved variables included demographic characteristics, diabetes history, laboratory test findings, and history of DR screening, etc. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to identify influencing factors of DR. A decision tree was used to explore interactions between diabetes type and other influencing factors of DR.We included 110 LADA, 101 T1DM, and 220 T2DM patients. DR prevalence was 26.4% in LADA patients, lower than that in T1DM (50.5%) and T2DM (47.7%) patients (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that diabetes duration (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.1-1.26, P < 0.001) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) (OR = 42.39, 95% CI: 10.88-165.11, P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for DR, and regular DR screening (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16-0.69, P = 0.003) was an independent protective factor. Decision tree analysis showed that in patients without DN with a diabetes duration of at least 10.5 years, T1DM and LADA patients had a higher incidence of DR than T2DM patients (72.7% vs. 55.1%).The prevalence of DR in diabetes patients was affected by diabetes duration, DN occurrence, and regular DR screening. Diabetes type indirectly affects DR occurrence through its interaction with diabetes duration and DN. Correct LADA diagnosis is necessary, and DR screening needs to be well-implemented.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to characterize the association of clinical and genetic risk factors such as: ACE genotype (rs17997552, rs1800764, rs4459609) and RGS2 (rs2746071) with the development of hypertension (HT) and non-dipping phenomenon in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). A total of 238 adolescents and young adults with T1DM-103 females and 135 males, aged 8-30 years (mean 17.35 ± 5.2) with diabetes duration 1-26 years (mean 7.72 ± 6.2), with mean HbA1c (IFCC) 58 ± 15 mmol/mmol-were subjected to 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM). The results of the ABPM were analyzed in association with the polymorphisms of ACE and RGS2 genes and clinical data of patients. HT was recognized in 65 (27 %) and non-dipping in 111 (46.63 %) patients. In the multivariate analysis of factors predisposing to HT, the variables that remained significant were the following: male sex (OR 1.62; 95 % CI 1.171-2.250), non-dipping (OR 1.40; 95 % CI 1.03-1.90) and total cholesterol level (OR 1.01; 95 % CI 1.005-1.021). The only factor influencing non-dipping was the duration of diabetes-OR 1.09 (95 % CI 1.04-1.14). The patients displaying non-dipping have a twice increased risk of development of HT (OR 2.17; 95 % CI 1.21-3.89). There was no association between disturbances of blood pressure (BP) and genotypes of ACE: rs17997552, rs1800764, rs4459609 and RGS2: rs2746071. Clinical rather than genetic risk factors seem to be connected with BP disturbances in young patients with T1DM. Although we have identified representative groups of HT versus non-HT and dipping versus non-dipping subjects, the effect of genetic predisposition to the development of higher BP is too weak to be statistically significant.",

Beyond its anti-tumor activity, increasing evidence in animal studies suggests that TRAIL plays a role in the control of autoimmune diseases, and in particular in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) [1, 2]. In this context, in a previous study carried out in a retrospective cohort of T1DM pediatric patients, we found significant lower levels of circulating TRAIL in T1DM patients with respect to healthy age-matched controls [3]. However, a limitation of our previous study was as follows: (1) the lack of serial serum samples harvested from the same patients at different time post onset and (2) the lack of information about concurrent metabolic status at time of blood sampling.\r\n\r\nOn these bases, the aim of the present study was to analyze the evolution of circulating TRAIL levels in a pilot group of pediatric patients admitted at Emergency Department for T1DM, from the time of hospital admission throughout the re-establishment of a normal metabolic balance and up to 18 months of clinical follow-up. Moreover, the serum levels of TRAIL in T1DM patients were analyzed in relation to the metabolic status determined at the same times.",

Methods A group of 165 patients diagnosed with T2DM were included in this study. Endothelial function was measured with the examination of brachial artery FMD. ELISA kit was used to measure the levels of CTRP4 in serum. HUVECs were stimulated with recombinant CTRP4 protein to assess its biological functions. Results The levels of CTRP4 showed a significant variation among three groups based on FMD tertiles ( p = 0.001). What’s more, FMD had a significant difference among three CTRP4 tertile groups ( p &lt; 0.05) and was negatively related to serum CTRP4 levels ( r = −0.270, p &lt; 0.001). In T2DM patients, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CTRP4 was the primary influence factor of low FMD ( p &lt; 0.01). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve of CTRP4 for predicting low FMD was 0.66 (95%CI 0.58–0.75). When stimulated HUVECs with recombinant CTRP4 protein, we found that CTRP4 could concentration-dependently ameliorate proliferation and migration of HUVECs in wounding healing and transwell assay. This protein could also decrease the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α and promote the release of NO in HUVEC supernatants, with suppression of NF-κB and STAT3 phosphorylation. Conclusions Serum CTRP4 concentrations were negatively associated with FMD. CTRP4 alleviated proliferation, migration and inflammation in HUVECs through the suppression of NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways.",

The aim of the study was to determine whether variability in body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure is associated with all-cause, cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality or with renal disease progression in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Methods The diabetes database was accessed, and all the information on patient visits (consultations) carried out in the study period (1 January 2008–31 December 2019) was extracted and linked to the laboratory database and the mortality register. Results The total number of patients included in the study population was 26,261, of whom 54.4% were male. Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 60.2 (51.8–68.3) years. The coefficient of variability of BMI was independently associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular, but not cancer, mortality. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) was associated with increased all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality as well as with renal progression. Variability in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure was associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in bivariate, but not in multivariate, analyses. Conclusions Variability in BMI was associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular, but not cancer, mortality in a large real-world contemporary population. Our results also confirm the association of HbA 1c with increased all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality as well as with renal progression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim Conflicting findings have been reported on whether in youths, the double diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) substantially impacts quality of life QoL, compared to subjects with T1D only. Methods In this study, 86 youths with double diagnosis and their parents were compared to 167 subjects with T1D only. QoL was assessed through the KINDL questionnaire. Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and dietary interviews evaluated the degree of maintaining a gluten-free diet (GFD). Results We found that having CD in addition to T1D has little effect on overall QoL. However, analysis of the degree of maintaining GFD revealed significantly lower total QoL scores in groups with T1D + CD not strictly maintaining GFD compared to T1D only ( p = 0.0014). The multivariable linear regression model confirmed the importance of maintaining GFD on QoL in subjects ( p = 0.0066) and parents ( p = 0.023). Conclusion The coexistence of T1D and CD and the adoption of a GFD resulted in poor QoL levels, as in youth as in their parents, when difficulties implementing the GFD are present. Psychological support should consider the importance of maintaining GFD not only to prevent potential complications in the future but also to improve actual QoL in different subdomains.",

However, little is known about the defensin system in the pancreas, especially in relation to Type 1 diabetes. We explore the expression of defensins in different disease stages of Type 1 diabetes and correlated obtained findings to the degree of inflammation, providing new insights into the disease and the innate immune system. Material and methods Pancreases from non-diabetic human organ donors of different age groups and donors with Type 1 diabetes with different disease duration were examined. Sections from head, body and tail of the pancreas were stained for eight different defensins and for immune cells; CD3+, CD45+, CD68+ and NES+ (granulocytes). Results In non-diabetic adult controls the level of expression for defensins Beta-1,Alpha-1, Cathelicidin and REG3A correlated with the level of inflammation. In contrast, individuals with Type 1 diabetes exhibit a reduction or absence of several central defensins regardless of the level of inflammation in their pancreas. The expression of Cathelicidin is present in neutrophils and macrophages but not in T-cells in subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Conclusions Obtained findings suggest a pancreatic dysfunction in the innate immune system and the bridging to the adaptive system in Type 1 diabetes. Further studies on the role of the local innate immune system in Type 1 diabetes is needed.",

Given the considerable number of open questions, a group of experts was convened with the aim of providing, through a Delphi consensus method, practical guidance for doctors. Methods A group of 6 experts developed a series of 29 statements on: the role of metabolic control in light of the most recent guidelines; BI intensification strategies: (1) add-on versus switch; (2) inertia in starting and titrating; (3) free versus fixed ratio combination; basal-bolus intensification and de-intensification strategies; second generation analogues of BI (2BI). A panel of 31 diabetologists, by accessing a dedicated website, assigned each statement a relevance score on a 9-point scale. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was adopted to assess the existence of disagreement among participants. Results Panelists showed agreement for all 29 statements, of which 26 were considered relevant, one was considered not relevant and two were of uncertain relevance. Panelists agreed that the availability of new classes of drugs often allows the postponement of BI and the simplification of therapy. It remains essential to promptly initiate and titrate BI when required. BI should always, unless contraindicated, be started in addition to, and not as a replacement, for ongoing treatments with cardiorenal benefits. 2BIs should be preferred for their pharmacological profile, greater ease of self-titration and flexibility of administration. Conclusion In a continuously evolving scenario, BI therapy still represents an important option in the management of T2D patients.",

We aimed to investigate the association between TyG index and the risk of heart failure hospitalization (HFH) in older diabetic patients received RVP. Methods This study was conducted between January 2017 and January 2018 at Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, China, and included older (age ≥ 65 years) diabetic patients that received RVP for the first time. TyG index were obtained before implantation. The primary endpoint was HFH. Results A total of 231 patients were divided into three groups according to the tertiles of TyG index: &lt; 8.5 (T1, N = 77), 8.5–9.1 (T2, N = 77), and &gt; 9.1 (T3, N = 77). T3 group had higher rate of HFH (Log-rank = 11.7, P = 0.003). Multivariate analyses showed that, TyG index served as an independent predictor for HFH, both as numerical variable (HR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.21–3.11, P = 0.006), and as categorical variable (HR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.09–4.89, P = 0.03). RCS demonstrated that the risk of HFH was relatively low until TyG index exceeded 8.8, beyond which the risk began to increase rapidly (P-non-linear = 0.006). Conclusion Preimplantation TyG index emerges as a robust, independent predictor for HFH in older diabetic patients received RVP, and TyG index &gt; 8.8 might be the optimal cut-off value.",

Methods The composition of Cai’s Herbal Tea was analyzed by Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS). C57BL/6 mice and Min6 pancreatic beta cells were divided into control, diabetic mellitus (DM)/high glucose (HG), and treatment groups (low, medium, and high doses of Cai’s Tea, and Metformin). Key physiological parameters, pancreatic islet health, Min6 cell morphology, viability, and insulin (INS) secretion were assessed. Small Interfering RNA-AMPK (si-AMPK) was utilized to confirm the pathway involvement. Results Cai’s Herbal Tea improved body weight, pancreatic islet pathological injury, and INS secretion whereas reduced total triglycerides, fasting blood sugar, and Interferon gamma (INF-γ) in T1DM mice, particularly at higher doses. In Min6 cells, Cai’s Tea mitigated HG-induced damage and proinflammatory response, enhancing cell viability and INS secretion. Notably, it reduced swelling and improved cristae structure in treated groups of mitochondria and promoted autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR pathway, evidenced by increased LC3II/LC3I and P-AMPK/AMPK ratios, and decreased P-mTOR/mTOR and P62 expressions in pancreatic islet β-cells. Furthermore, these effects were converted by si-AMPK interference. Conclusion Cai’s Herbal Tea exhibits significant therapeutic efficacy in T1DM mice by improving mitochondrial health and inducing autophagy through the AMPK-mTOR pathway in pancreatic islet β-cells. These findings highlight its potential as a therapeutic approach for T1DM management.",

    "abstract": "Aims: To address the scarcity of continued education for insulin pump users, we developed and evaluated a new program (NP) for individuals transitioning to a different insulin pump. Methods: In a randomized, controlled 3-month study, adults with type 1 diabetes and suboptimal HbA1c received either NP or usual care program (UC). The NP was designed in collaboration with representatives of the target group and incorporated technical training, case-based learning, and peer experience sharing – encompassing two group sessions, and two follow-up telephone calls. The UC included a single training session led by the pump company with hotline assistance (clinic) but no structured follow-up. The primary endpoint was the difference in time in range (TIR) (70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L)), measured by continuous glucose monitoring from baseline to 3 months post-course. Psychosocial self-efficacy was measured by the Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES-SF). Results: Thirty-nine participants (median age 43, 74% female) were included. Mean TIR increased significantly in the NP group and remained unchanged in the UC group (between-group difference in change was 13.5% [95% CI: 4.0 to 22.9], p = 0.0064). Psychosocial self-efficacy improved and HbA1c decreased only significantly in the NP group. Conclusions: Applying a novel education program at pump transition significantly improved glycemic outcomes and self-efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims There is a potential association between oxidative stress and the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The Oxidative Balance Score (OBS), derived from dietary and lifestyle factors, acts as a comprehensive marker of oxidative stress. Research examining the relationship between OBS and DKD is scarce. This study aims to evaluate the association between OBS and the risk of DKD among U.S. adults. Methods This study enrolled 6,725 eligible participants from the U.S. population through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005–2020). Patients with DKD were defined as those with diabetes who had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m². The OBS consists of 20 composite scores derived from dietary and lifestyle factors. To assess the potential relationship between OBS and DKD, weighted logistic regression and restricted cubic spline statistical approaches were employed. Results The risk of DKD was inversely correlated with OBS, dietary OBS, and lifestyle OBS ( p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the lowest quartile of OBS, the adjusted odds ratios (OR) for OBS, lifestyle OBS and dietary OBS, and DKD in the highest quartile were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.48–0.70), 0.64 (95% CI: 0.51–0.81), and 0.57 (95% CI: 0.46–0.70), respectively. A substantial nonlinear relationship between lifestyle OBS and DKD was identified using the RCS curve (p for nonlinearity = 0.0081), which appeared as an inverted ‘L’ shape. Using the two-piecewise logistic regression model, a turning point in lifestyle OBS was identified at a score of 3 ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Among the American population, OBS and DKD are significantly negatively correlated, suggesting that maintaining a higher OBS may reduce the risk of developing DKD.",

    "abstract": "13C-glucose breath tests are reported as an alternative non-invasive method to evaluate glucose metabolism. However, the metabolic results differ based on the site of the carbon atom in the glucose. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the metabolism of carbon atoms contained in glucose in patients with diabetes using [1, 2, 3-13C]glucose breath tests. Sixteen healthy participants and 20 diabetic patients were enrolled in the study. Three types of breath tests, [1-13C], [2-13C], and [3-13C]glucose breath tests, were performed after an overnight fast. Breath samples were taken at baseline and at 10-min intervals over 150 min, and 13CO2 excretion curves were expressed using non-dispersive infrared isotope spectrometry. 13CO2 levels increased more rapidly, and the peak value of 13CO2 (Cmax) was highest after the administration of [3-13C]glucose followed by [2-13C] and [1-13C]glucose in controls. Delayed 13CO2 excretion and a low area under the curve through 150 min (AUC150) were obtained in diabetic patients. The group with severe diabetes had a significantly lower Cmax and AUC150 in the [1-13C]glucose breath test. The [1-13C]glucose breath test, which has been used to evaluate glucose metabolism, is suitable for patients with late-stage diabetes, whereas the [2-13C]glucose breath test is ideal in the early stages. Although the [3-13C]glucose breath test is theoretically useful for evaluating the uptake of glucose and the anaerobic glycolysis system, it can be used in practice to distinguish reduced uptake from impaired oxidation of glucose in combination with the other two tests.",

Methods This is an observational study, including 201 mother–child pairs originating from the Finnish Gestational Diabetes Prevention Study (RADIEL; 96 with GDM, 128 with pre-pregnancy obesity) with follow-up from gestation to 6-year postpartum. Follow-up included dyads anthropometrics, body composition, blood pressure, and child left ventricular function with comprehensive echocardiography (conventional and strain imaging). Results Offspring left ventricular diastolic and systolic function was not associated with gestational glucose concentrations, GDM, or pregravida obesity. Child body fat percentage correlated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI in the setting of maternal obesity ( r = 0.23, P = 0.009). After adjusting for child lean body mass, age, sex, systolic BP, resting HR, maternal lean body mass, pre-gestational BMI, and GDM status, child left atrial volume increased by 0.3 ml (95% CI 0.1, 0.5) for each 1% increase in child body fat percentage. Conclusions No evidence of foetal cardiac programming related to GDM or maternal pre-pregnancy obesity was observed in early childhood. Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with early weight gain. Child adiposity in early childhood is independently associated with increased left atrial volume, but its implications for long-term left ventricle diastolic function and cardiovascular health remain unknown.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The higher frequency of infections in diabetic patients is caused by a hyperglycemic environment, which promotes immune dysfunction. People with diabetes are more prone to skin infections. A continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system provides information on changes in blood glucose (BG) levels throughout the day. Its use facilitates optimal therapeutic decisions for a diabetic patient. One of the factors limiting the use of CGM is inflammation at the insertion site. Aim of the study The aim of the study was the microbiological identification of the bacterial strains which are found on CGM sensor electrodes. Material and methods We performed microbiological tests on patients′ CGM Enlite Medtronic electrodes, which were removed after 6 days of usage according to the manufacturer′s instructions. 31 sensors were examined from 31 children (14 girls) aged from 0.5 to 14.6 years. The microbiological analysis was routinely performed at the Department of Children’s Diabetology Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland. Results 12 (39%) of the electrodes were colonized. In 11 (92%) cases the electrodes were colonized by one bacteria strain. 7 times methicillin-sensitive coagulase negative staphylococcus (MSCNS) was detected. We also found one case of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Ochrobactrum tritici, Bacillus sonorensis and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) colonization. One electrode was colonized by the mixed flora Enterococcus faecalis , methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), Pseudomonas stutzeri , methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The median HbA1c in the group with colonization of electrodes was 6, 85% (6, 3–7, 6%) versus 6, 3% (5, 8–7, 5%) in the group without colonization. The median BMI in the group with colonization of the electrodes was 17.10 kg/m 2 (16.28–18.62 kg/m 2 ) versus 15.98 kg/m 2 (15.14–17.96 kg/m 2 ) in the group without colonization. Statistically, significantly more frequently electrodes are colonized in older children (median age in the group with colonization of electrodes 11.43 years (6.52–12.27 years), without colonization 8.42 years. (3.098–9.375 years); ( p = 0.033). Conclusions It seems that older children are more likely to have their sensor electrode colonized by bacterial strains.",

    "abstract": "Maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy is associated with short- and long-term adverse effects affecting both mothers and the offspring. Despite behavioral and pharmacological treatment, the rate of maternal and neonatal complications in pregnancies complicated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is still higher than in general population [1, 2]. Data from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study (HAPO) that was first published in 2008 showed a continuous positive correlation between glycemia on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the rate of large for gestational age infants (LGA), neonatal hypoglycemia, cord blood C-peptide concentration > 90th percentile, and cesarean section in a cohort of approximately 25,000 pregnant women from different populations [3]. On this basis, the new diagnostic criteria for GDM were proposed and then incorporated into the most recommendations and standards, including these published by the World Health Organization (WHO). \r\n\r\nStill, there is no universally accepted consensus on glycemic goals in the treatment for GDM because data on the effect of different glycemic targets on pregnancy outcomes in GDM are limited. Most scientific societies suggest the thresholds for glucose concentrations of 95 mg/dL at fasting and 140 mg/dL at 1-h postprandial (strength-of-recommendation grade B) [4].\r\n\r\nIn 2017, the Polish Diabetes Association (PDA) raised the 1-h postprandial glucose (1-h PPG) threshold from < 120 mg/dL to < 140 mg/dL [5]. This change prompted us to compare the obstetric results of women with GDM in two time intervals: treated using the previous (1-h PPG < 120 mg/dL) and present (1-h PPG < 140 mg/dL), less stringent, recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Neurotensin (NT) is a gut hormone that promotes lipids absorption and controls appetite. Elevated circulating pro-NT, the stable precursor of NT, is associated with cardiovascular (CV) disease, metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Features of MS and insulin resistance are reported also in type 1 diabetes (T1D), with detrimental impact on the overall CV risk profile. Aims of the study were to evaluate plasma pro-NT in T1D patients and to test whether its levels are associated with and/or predictive of CV risk factors and overall risk profile.For this longitudinal retrospective study, we analyzed clinical data from 41 T1D individuals referring to the diabetes outpatient clinics at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, collected at the baseline and after 10 years. Fasting plasma pro-NT levels were measured in T1D subjects at the baseline and in 34 age-, sex-, BMI-comparable healthy individuals recruited in the same period.Pro-NT did not differ significantly between patients and controls (median[range] pro-NT: 156.3 [96.6-198.2] vs. 179.4 [139.7-230.7] pmol/L, p = 0.26). In T1D, greater fasting pro-NT associated with poor glycemic control at baseline and predicted increased waist circumference, reduced insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia and hypertension at 10-year follow-up. High pro-NT predicted 10-year very-high CV risk with adjusted OR = 11 (95%C.I.: 1.4-94.5; p = 0.029).In T1D individuals, elevated pro-NT levels predict the development of adverse metabolic profile, which translates in higher CV risk profile at 10-year follow-up. Pro-NT represents a novel predictor/marker of CV risk factors in adults with T1D.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim People of Black African ancestry, who are known to be at disproportionately high risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), typically exhibit lower hepatic insulin clearance compared with White Europeans. However, the mechanisms underlying this metabolic characteristic are poorly understood. We explored whether low insulin clearance in Black African (BA) men could be explained by insulin resistance, subclinical inflammation or adiponectin concentrations. Methods BA and White European (WE) men, categorised as either normal glucose tolerant (NGT) or with T2D, were recruited to undergo the following: a mixed meal tolerance test with C-peptide modelling to determine endogenous insulin clearance; fasting serum adiponectin and cytokine profiles; a hyperinsulinaemic–euglycaemic clamp to measure whole-body insulin sensitivity; and magnetic resonance imaging to quantify visceral adipose tissue. Results Forty BA (20 NGT and 20 T2D) and 41 WE (23 NGT and 18 T2D) men were studied. BA men had significantly lower insulin clearance ( P = 0.011) and lower plasma adiponectin ( P = 0.031) compared with WE men. In multiple regression analysis, ethnicity, insulin sensitivity and plasma adiponectin were independent predictors of insulin clearance, while age, visceral adiposity and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α ) did not significantly contribute to the variation. Conclusion These data suggest that adiponectin may play a direct role in the upregulation of insulin clearance beyond its insulin-sensitising properties.",

Here, we investigated markers of exocrine pancreas dysfunction in individuals at-risk of developing type 1 diabetes.Serum P-amylase and lipase levels were assessed in samples obtained from healthy controls, patients with new onset type 1 diabetes, relatives participating to the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention who were, at blood collection, autoantibody negative or positive for a single autoantibody (low-risk individuals), and positive for multiple autoantibodies (high-risk individuals). Linear mixed models were adopted to estimate variation of pancreatic enzymes among the groups and to evaluate the influence of high-risk HLA genotypes and residual beta cell function on exocrine pancreas function.In adults, but not children, reduced levels of P-amylase and lipase were shown in at-risk individuals, including (for P-amylase levels only) those at low-risk, and in T1Dnew. Furthermore, while high-risk HLA genotypes negatively affected P-amylase levels in autoantibody negative adult individuals, fasting C-peptide levels did not correlate with pancreatic enzyme levels.Exocrine pancreas dysfunction precedes the onset of type 1 diabetes in adult at-risk individuals and may be unrelated to fasting C-peptide levels.",

The aim of this study was to validate the HbA1c value as a surrogate for all-cause mortality in people with type 2 diabetes. Methods The effect estimates for HbA1c lowering after treatment as well as reductions in all-cause mortality of randomized trials were extracted from a systematic review and updated. For the measurement of actual surrogacy, weighted linear regression models with a random intercept for the study effect were used with the all-cause mortality estimate (risk difference and log relative risk) as the outcome and the estimate for HbA1c difference as the covariate. Surrogacy was assessed according to the criteria of Daniels and Hughes. Results A total of 346 HbA1c-mortality-pairs from 205 single randomized trials were included in the analysis. Regarding the risk difference of all-cause mortality, there was no evidence for surrogacy of the HbA1c value. For the log relative risk, a small positive association between HbA1c and the all-cause mortality estimate (slope 0.129 [95% confidence interval −0.043; 0.302]) was observed. However, there was no sign of valid surrogacy. Conclusions Based on the results of more than 200 randomized trials, HbA1c is not a valid surrogate marker for all-cause mortality in people with type 2 diabetes.",

We designed an eye-tracking-based test to evaluate oculomotor function in patients with type 1 diabetes. Methods We used the SRLab—Tobii TX300 Eye tracker® , an eye-tracking device, coupled with software that we developed to test abnormalities in the oculomotor system. The software consists of a series of eye-tracking tasks divided into 4 classes of parameters (Resistance, Wideness, Pursuit and Velocity) to evaluate both smooth and saccadic movement in different directions. We analyzed the oculomotor system in 34 healthy volunteers and in 34 patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes. Results Among the 474 parameters analyzed with the eye-tracking-based system, 11% were significantly altered in patients with type 1 diabetes ( p &lt; 0.05), with a higher proportion of abnormalities observed in the Wideness (24%) and Resistance (10%) parameters. Patients with type 1 diabetes without diabetic neuropathy showed more frequently anomalous measurements in the Resistance class ( p = 0.02). The classes of Velocity and Pursuit were less frequently altered in patients with type 1 diabetes as compared to healthy subjects, with anomalous measurements mainly observed in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Conclusions Abnormalities in oculomotor system function can be detected in patients with type 1 diabetes using a novel eye-tracking-based test. A larger cohort study may further determine thresholds of normality and validate whether eye-tracking can be used to non-invasively characterize early signs of diabetic neuropathy.

    "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is thought to be associated with cardio-metabolic risk factor development in women and their children during the early postpartum period and early childhood. We hypothesized that these women and their children would exhibit increased abnormal cardio-metabolic risk factors three years after pregnancy.Women from the Screening Tests to Predict Poor Outcomes of Pregnancy study were invited to attend a follow-up with the child from their index pregnancy at 3 years postpartum. Women and children were assessed for anthropometric measures and haemodynamic function. Fasting blood samples were obtained from women to assess lipid and glucose status.A total of 281 woman-child dyads participated in the 3-year follow-up, with 40 women developing GDM during their index pregnancy. Fasting serum insulin was higher in women with GDM in index pregnancy compared to those with an uncomplicated pregnancy. However, this association was mediated by early pregnancy BMI and socioeconomic index (SEI). The rate of metabolic syndrome was higher in the GDM group than the uncomplicated pregnancy group. Maternal GDM was associated with elevated maternal fasting serum triglycerides at 3 years after adjustment for early pregnancy BMI and SEI. Children exposed to GDM in utero had higher waist circumference compared to children born after an uncomplicated pregnancy, but this is mediated the above covariates.Exposure to GDM is associated with elevated serum triglycerides in women at 3 years postpartum but other cardiometabolic outcomes in women and children appear to be mediated by early pregnancy BMI and SEI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims The 2019 and 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) classifications stratified patients with type 2 diabetes into three categories according to the 10-year risk of death from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The very high-risk category included individuals with established ASCVD, target organ damage (TOD), and/or, in the 2019 classification only, ≥ 3 additional ASCVD risk factors. We assessed risk of all-cause mortality according to the two ESC classifications in the Renal Insufficiency And Cardiovascular Events cohort. Methods Participants (n = 15,773) were stratified based on the presence of ASCVD, TOD, and ASCVD risk factors at baseline (2006–2008). Vital status was retrieved in 2015. Results Less than 1% of participants fell in the moderate-risk category. According to the 2019 classification, ~ 1/3 fell in the high-risk and ~ 2/3 in the very high-risk category, whereas the opposite occurred with the 2021 classification. Mortality risk increased across categories according to both classifications. Among very high-risk patients, mortality was much lower in those with ≥ 3 additional ASCVD risk factors and almost equal in those with TOD and ASCVD ± TOD, using the 2019 classification, whereas it was much higher in those with ASCVD + TOD and, to a lesser extent, TOD only than in those with ASCVD only, using the 2021 classification. Conclusions The negligible number of moderate-risk patients suggests that these classifications might overestimate risk of ASCVD death. Downgrading patients with ≥ 3 additional ASCVD risk factors to the high-risk category is consistent with mortality data. Risk of death is very high in the presence of TOD irrespective of established ASCVD. Trial registration : ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00715481.",

Methods Children from the Shanghai Children and Adolescent Diabetes Eye (SCADE) study and adults from the Shanghai Cohort Study of Diabetic Eye Disease (SCODE) were examined in 2021. Serum 12-HETE levels were detected and compared. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between 12-HETE and the rate of DR in diabetic patients. Results The child study included 4 patients with new-onset DR and 24 patients with T1DM without DR. In children with T1DM, the 12-HETE level was significantly higher in those with DR ( P = 0.003). The adult study had two sets, for testing and verification. The test set included 28 patients with new-onset DR and 24 T2DM patients with a course of ≥ 20 years who had never developed DR. The verification set included 41 patients with DR, 50 patients without DR and 50 healthy controls. In the adult test set, the 12-HETE level was significantly higher in patients with DR than in those with T2DM without DR ( P = 0.003). In the verification set, the 12-HETE level of patients with DR was significantly higher than that of patients without DR ( P &lt; 0.0001) and the healthy controls ( P &lt; 0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that 12-HETE was independently associated with DR in both children (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.13, P = 0.041) and adults (test set [OR 9.26, 95% CI 1.77–48.59, P = 0.008], verification set [OR 10.49, 95% CI 3.23–34.05, P &lt; 0.001]). Conclusion Higher serum 12-HETE levels are positively correlated with an increased risk of DR in children with T1DM and adults with T2DM.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the prevalence of CPDs in patients with T2D in Italy.This is a monocentric cross-sectional study; n = 184 T2D patients were screened for CPDs using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Primary outcome was to evaluate the prevalence of CPDs. To assess association between CPDs and risk factors, we have utilized univariable logistic regression models.64.1% were men, median age was 67 (59-64) and median BMI 27 (25-30) kg/m2. The 42.9% tested positive for one or more mental disorders, 25.6% for depression. Patients with higher BMI (p = 0.04) had an increased likelihood of testing positive to the PHQ. Patients who had implemented lifestyle changes (p < 0.01) and were aware that mental health is linked to body health (p = 0.07) had a reduction in the likelihood of testing positive.Prevalence of CPDs in T2D patients is higher than in the general population. Since CPDs favor the onset and subsistence of T2D, integrated diabetic-psychiatric therapy is required for improvement or remission of T2D in patients with comorbid CPDs.",

The information on GDM, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results, and maternal backgrounds was derived from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. The pre-pregnancy BSA was calculated by using the Mosteller formula. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between BSA and GDM/ OGTT separately by the body mass index groups.A lower BSA predicted an increased risk for GDM and pathological OGTT among the underweight (b = - 2.69, SE = 0.25, p < 0.001; b = - 2.66, SE = 0.23, p < 0.001, respectively) pregnant women, and normal weight (b = - 0.30, SE = 0.10, p = 0.002; b = - 0.67, SE = 0.09, p < 0.001, respectively) pregnant women; and pathological OGTT among the overweight (b = - 0.31, SE = 0.10, p = 0.001) pregnant women. Within the obese class II or greater, a higher BSA predicted a higher risk for GDM (b = 0.74, SE = 0.12, p < 0.001) and pathological OGTT (b = 0.79, SE = 0.13, p < 0.001). Maternal smoking predicted a significantly higher risk of GDM and pathological OGTTs in almost all body mass index groups.This study showed that in comparison with women with a higher BSA, underweight, and normal weight pregnant women with a smaller BSA may be more susceptible to GDM and have a pathological OGTT.",

Methods Patients with obesity and T2D ( n = 126) submitted to RYGB with 10 or more years of follow-up. It was a unicentric trial. Pre-operative anthropometric and clinical data was retrieved to calculate DiaRem, DiaBetter, Ad-DiaRem and 5y-Ad-DiaRem scores, while a hospital visit was conducted to assess current diabetes status. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated as estimate of the scores’ accuracy to predict long-term T2D remission. Results Among the entire cohort ( n = 126), 70 subjects (55.6%) achieved and maintained T2D remission 10 or more years after RYGB. The 5y-Ad-DiaRem score was the one that depicted the highest discriminative power (AUROC = 0.838) to predict long-term T2D remission when compared to DiaBetter (AUROC = 0.735), DiaRem (AUROC = 0.721) and Ad-DiaRem (AUROC = 0.720). Conclusion The score with highest accuracy to predict long-term T2D remission after RYGB surgery was the 5y-Ad-DiaRem. Yet, the available scores accuracy to predict T2D remission in the long term is still suboptimal, highlighting the unmet need for a better scoring system.",

Risk factors for diabetes complications (diabetes duration, blood pressure, HbA1c) were assessed. The IGF1 rs35767 and PPARG rs1801282 SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan RT-PCR system. An additive genetic interaction was calculated. Association analysis between markers of renal function and both SNPs or their additive interaction were performed.Both SNPs showed a significant association with eGFR: the A allele of rs35767 or the C allele of rs1801282 were associated to reduced eGFR compared to G alleles. Multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, z-BMI, T1D duration, blood pressure and Hba1c values showed that the additive genetic interaction was independently associated with lower eGFR (β = -3.59 [-6.52 to -0.66], p = 0.017). No associations were detected between SNPs, their additive interaction and ACR.These results provide new insight into the genetic predisposition to renal dysfunction, showing that two polymorphisms in IGF1 and PPARG genes can lead to a reduction in renal filtration rate leading these patients to be exposed to a higher risk of early renal complications.",

    "abstract": "Incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) cause increased insulin secretion in non-pregnant adults, but their role in pregnancy, where there are additional metabolically-active hormones from the placenta, is less clear. The aim of the present study was to assess if fasting and post-load incretin concentrations were predictive of pregnancy insulin and glucose concentrations.Pregnant women (n = 394) with one or more risk factors for gestational diabetes were recruited at 28 weeks for a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Glucose, insulin, GLP-1 and GIP were measured in the fasting state and 120 min after glucose ingestion.Fasting plasma GLP-1 concentrations were associated with plasma insulin (standardised β' 0.393 (0.289-0.498), p = 1.3 × 10-12; n = 306), but not with glucose concentrations (p = 0.3). The association with insulin was still evident when adjusting for BMI (β' 0.271 (0.180-0.362), p = 1.1 × 10-8; n = 297). Likewise, at 120 min the OGTT GLP-1 concentrations were associated with plasma insulin concentrations (β' 0.216 (0.100-0.331), p = 2.7 × 10-4; n = 306) even after adjusting for BMI (β' 0.178 (0.061-0.294), p = 2.9 × 10-3; n = 296), but not with glucose (p = 0.9). GIP concentrations were not associated with insulin or glucose concentrations at either time point (all p > 0.2). In pregnancy plasma GLP-1, but not GIP, concentrations appear to be predictive of circulating insulin concentrations, independently of associations with BMIs.These results suggest that the relationship between insulin and incretins is preserved in pregnancy, but that other factors, such as placental hormones or counter-regulatory hormones, may be more important determinants of glycaemia and gestational diabetes aetiology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims This study aims to describe the prevalence of monogenic diabetes in an Australian referral cohort, in relation to Exeter maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) probability calculator (EMPC) scores and next-generation sequencing with updated testing where relevant. Methods State-wide 5-year retrospective cohort study of individuals referred for monogenic diabetes genetic testing. Results After excluding individuals who had cascade testing for a familial variant (21) or declined research involvement (1), the final cohort comprised 40 probands. Incorporating updated testing, the final genetic result was positive (likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant) in 11/40 (27.5%), uncertain (variant of uncertain significance) in 8/40 (20%) and negative in 21/40 (52.5%) participants. Causative variants were found in GCK , HNF1A, MT-TL1 and HNF4A . Variants of uncertain significance included a novel multi-exonic GCK duplication. Amongst participants with EMPC scores ≥ 25%, a causative variant was identified in 37%. Cascade testing was positive in 9/10 tested relatives with diabetes and 0/6 tested relatives with no history of diabetes. Conclusions Contemporary genetic testing produces a high yield of positive results in individuals with clinically suspected monogenic diabetes and their relatives with diabetes, highlighting the value of genetic testing for this condition. An EMPC score cutoff of ≥ 25% correctly yielded a positive predictive value of ≥ 25% in this multiethnic demographic. This is the first Australian study to describe EMPC scores in the Australian clinic setting, albeit a biased referral cohort. Larger studies may help characterise EMPC performance between ethnic subsets, noting differences in the expected probability of monogenic diabetes relative to type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims This study examines how family-related factors influence the management of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). We investigate the relationship between family patterns, parental work schedules and metabolic control. Materials and methods We analysed data from a nationwide diabetes survey (DPV) focusing on HbA1c, severe hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hospital admissions and inpatient treatment duration. We used linear regression and negative binomial regression models. Our study includes 15,340 children under the age of 18 with data on family structure and parental division of labour. Results Children from two-parent households have better HbA 1c outcomes than children from single-parent, blended or no-parent households ( p &lt; .0001). Higher HbA 1C levels are associated with children living with an unemployed father, as opposed to those with full-time working parents or with a full-time working father and a part-time working mother ( p &lt; .001). Conclusions These findings emphasise the importance of carefully considering family structure and working time models in the management of paediatric T1DM. Our results highlight risk factors within the family environment and emphasise the need for family-focused counselling of high-risk patients or severe cases in clinical practice.",

Pancreatic perfusion can be assessed by both positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the methods have not been directly compared or benchmarked against the gold-standard microsphere technique.Pigs (n = 4) were examined by [15O]H2O PET and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI technique simultaneously using a hybrid PET/MRI scanner. The pancreatic perfusion was measured both at basal conditions and after intravenous (IV) administration of up to 0.5 g/kg glucose.Pancreatic perfusion increased by 35%, 157%, and 29% after IV 0.5 g/kg glucose compared to during basal conditions, as assessed by [15O]H2O PET, IVIM MRI, and microspheres, respectively. There was a correlation between pancreatic perfusion as assessed by [15O]H2O PET and IVIM MRI (r = 0.81, R2 = 0.65, p < 0.01). The absolute quantification of pancreatic perfusion (ml/min/g) by [15O]H2O PET was within a 15% error of margin of the microsphere technique.Pancreatic perfusion by [15O]H2O PET was in agreement with the microsphere technique assessment. The IVIM MRI method has the potential to replace [15O]H2O PET if the pancreatic perfusion is sufficiently large, but not when absolute quantitation is required.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have examined how improved metabolic control might influence vibration perception thresholds (VPTs). The aim of this study was to evaluate if improved HbA1c can influence vibration thresholds in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1DM).VPTs were investigated at six frequencies (4-125 Hz) using VibroSense Meter in the sole of the foot at two occasions in 159 T1DM patients, at the heads of the first and fifth metatarsal bones, i.e. MTH1 and MTH5, respectively. The participants were divided into three groups: group A: HbA1c improved by more than 1 mmol/mol (n = 95), group B: HbA1c deteriorated by more than 1 mmol/mol (n = 48) and group C: HbA1c unchanged (± 1 mmol/mol) (n = 16) compared to baseline.In group A, the mean z-score, reflecting the combined effect of all VPTs, improved being lower at the follow-up than at the baseline [0.2 (- 0.3 to 1.2) vs. -0.1 (- 0.7 to 0.8), p = 0.00002]. VPTs improved at 4 and 64 Hz at both MTH1 (metatarsal head 1) and MTH5. The VPTs at 125 Hz frequency improved at MTH5, but not at MTH1. No significant differences were seen in group B or group C.Lower HbA1c and lower VPTs in T1DM patients were associated with improved VPT, suggesting a reversible effect on nerve function by improved metabolic control.",

    "abstract": "As the first long-term RCT on insoluble cereal fibre, the optimal fibre trial demonstrated glycometabolic benefits, confirming cohort studies. The combined study intervention of lifestyle recommendations and supplementation with insoluble oat hulls fibre allows to clarify, which amount of fibre is required for a beneficial effect.One hundred and eighty participants with impaired glucose tolerance underwent the one-year PREDIAS lifestyle programme and received a blinded, randomized fibre or placebo supplement for two years. We conducted a regression analyses and cut-off-based tertile comparisons in subjects with full data on dietary compliance (food records and accounted supplement; n = 120) after one year, investigating effects on fasting blood parameters, oral glucose tolerance test and anthropometry.We found a nonlinear inverse relation between fibre intake and change in postprandial 2-h glucose levels, showing a metabolic benefit beyond 14 g and a plateau beyond 25 g of total insoluble fibre per day. 2-h glucose levels improved significantly stronger in both upper tertiles (-0.9 [-1.6;-0.2] mmol/l, p = 0.047, and -0.6 [-1.6;0.3] mmol/l, p = 0.010) compared to the lowest tertile (0.1 [-1.2;1.1] mmol/l), also when adjusted for changes in bodyweight. Subjects with the highest fibre intake showed superior effects on fasting and postprandial insulin resistance, hepatic insulin clearance, leucocyte count and fatty liver index.Extending the knowledge on the benefits of insoluble oat hulls fibre, our post hoc analysis demonstrates a dose effect for glycaemia and associated metabolic markers. Further research is needed in order to replicate our findings in larger trials.",

    "abstract": "Hamman’s syndrome, which is also known as spontaneous pneumomediastinum, could be induced in various situations such as labor and delivery [1]. The potential mechanism for Hamman’s syndrome is as follows: The vulnerability of alveolar walls by some reason increases air pressure, which leads to alveolar rupture. Then, spilled air peels the connective tissue and finally enters into mediastinal space through pulmonary hilum. Hamman’s syndrome is one of the relatively rare pulmonary diseases, and there are few reports showing the case of Hamman’s syndrome triggered by the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus accompanied by diabetic ketoacidosis. However, recently we experienced three cases of young male subjects with Hamman’s syndrome triggered by the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus accompanied by diabetic ketoacidosis. These cases are very rare, and there were many similarities among these three cases. Clinical characteristics of these three cases were as follows: age (years old): 29, 20, 20 (case 1, case 2, case 3); gender: male, male, male; HbA1c (%): 12.0, 12.3, 6.9; plasma glucose level (mg/dL): 1298, 1543, 783; pH: 6.89, 7.10, 7.24; total ketone body concentration in blood (lmol/ L): 1662, 20,960, 15,500; acetoacetic acid (lmol/L): 734, 5080, 2960; 3-hydroxybutyric acid (lmol/L): 928, 15,880, 12,540; WBC (/mL): 37,370, 27,590, 7050; CRP (mg/dL): 4.01,\\0.03, 0.76, respectively. Type of diabetes in all three subjects was type 1A, and the autoantibodies of the pancreas were positive: anti-GAD antibody (U/mL): 157.7, 3.0, 1.5 (case 1, case 2, case 3); anti-IA-2 antibody (U/mL): 2.6, 5.6, \\0.4, respectively. Marked reduction in body weight was observed: BMI on admission (kg/m): 25.1, 13.7, 19.0; BMI before the onset of type 1 diabetes (kg/m): 29.3, 17.2, 21.7; recent weight loss (kg/duration): 10 kg/1 month, 11 kg/2 weeks, 8 kg/1 week, respectively. All three cases experienced vomiting very frequently, and case 1 and 2, but not case 3, experienced chest pain. On physical examination, subcutaneous emphysema was observed in all three cases. In chest X-ray, pneumomediastinum was observed in these three cases (red arrows) (Fig. 1). Also, in computed tomography, such pneumomediastinum was confirmed in these three cases (red circles) (Fig. 1). In case 1, pneumonia image was observed in lower right lung field (blue arrows and blue circle). In addition, subcutaneous emphysema was observed in all cases. We immediately started antibiotics therapy in order to prevent the progression of inflammation. Mediastinal emphysema image in chest X-ray disappeared in several days after starting the therapy. The number of days required for the disappearance of emphysema image in these three cases was 4, 9 and 5 days, respectively. The number of days until the complete recovery was 15, 9 and 6 days, respectively. There were no sequelae and no recurrence of emphysema at all in all cases. It is thought that in cases with diabetic ketoacidosis air pressure could be increased by Kussmaul’s breathing or repeated vomiting [2, 3]. Therefore, we think that repeated vomiting might have triggered the onset of Hamman’s syndrome in these three subjects. In addition, decrease in pulmonary surfactant observed with diabetic ketone acidosis could lead to the vulnerability of alveolar walls [4]. Managed by Antonio Secchi.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss in obese patients leads to improved left ventricular (LV) function. It is unclear whether improving glycaemic control has additional benefits to weight loss alone in patients with type 2 diabetes, or if benefits of weight loss are mediated through improving glycaemic control. This case–control study examined the incremental impact of these approaches on LV function. Three groups of age, gender, and baseline HbA1c-matched patients with type 2 diabetes and suboptimal glycaemic control were followed-up for 12 months. Group 1 patients did not improve HbA1c ≥ 1 % (10.9 mmol/mol) or lose weight. Group 2 improved HbA1c ≥ 1 % but did not lose weight. Group 3 improved HbA1c ≥ 1 % (10.9 mmol/mol) and lost weight. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiogram at baseline and at follow-up. At baseline, three groups were comparable in all clinical and metabolic parameters except Group 3 had highest body mass index. The three groups had similar echocardiographic parameters except Group 3 had the worst LV systolic function [global longitudinal strain (GLS)]. At follow-up, LV ejection fraction and diastolic function improved with a reduction in filling pressures in Group 2 and more so in Group 3. LV filling pressures in Group 1 increased. There was a significant improvement in GLS in Group 2 and more so in Group 3. Despite GLS being the worst in Group 3 at baseline, this was comparable between Groups 2 and 3 at follow-up. In overweight patients with type 2 diabetes, weight loss and improved glycaemic control had additive beneficial effects on improving LV systolic and diastolic function.",

    "abstract": "Albuminuria is strongly associated with risk of renal dysfunction, cardiovascular disease and mortality. However, clinical guidelines diverge, and evidence is sparse on what risk factor levels regarding blood pressure, blood lipids and BMI are needed to prevent albuminuria in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes.A total of 9347 children and adults with type 1 diabetes [mean age 15.3 years and mean diabetes duration 1.4 years at start of follow-up] from The Swedish National Diabetes Registry were followed from first registration until end of 2017. Levels for risk factors for a risk increase in nephropathy were evaluated, and the gradient of risk per 1 SD (standard deviation) was estimated to compare the impact of each risk factor.During the follow-up period, 8610 (92.1%) remained normoalbuminuric, 737 (7.9%) individuals developed micro- or macroalbuminuria at any time period of whom 132 (17.9% of 737) individuals developed macroalbuminuria. Blood pressure ≥ 140/80 mmHg was associated with increased risk of albuminuria (p ≤ 0.0001), as were triglycerides ≥ 1.0 mmol/L (p = 0.039), total cholesterol ≥ 5.0 mmol/L (p = 0.0003), HDL < 1.0 mmol/L (p = 0.013), LDL 3.5- < 4.0 mmol/L (p = 0.020), and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (p = 0.033). HbA1c was the strongest risk factor for any albuminuria estimated by the measure gradient of risk per 1 SD, followed by diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol and LDL. In patients with HbA1c > 65 mmol/mol (> 8.1%), blood pressure > 140/70 mmHg was associated with increased risk of albuminuria.Preventing renal complications in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes need avoidance at relatively high levels of blood pressure, blood lipids and BMI, whereas very tight control is not associated with further risk reduction. For patients with long-term poor glycaemic control, stricter blood pressure control is advocated.",

We use published weights of genetic variants and exposure variables to derive the T2D polygenic (PGS) and polyexposure (PXS) risk scores and test their associations to incident diseases.PXS was associated with higher levels of clinical risk factors including BMI, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, triglycerides, and HbA1c in individuals without overt or diagnosed T2D. In addition to predicting incident T2D, PXS and PGS were significantly and positively associated with the incidence of all 7 other chronic diseases. There were 4% and 8% of individuals in the bottom deciles of PXS and PGS, respectively, who were prediabetic at baseline but had low risks of T2D and other chronic diseases. Compared to the remaining population, individuals in the top deciles of PGS and PXS had particularly high risks of developing chronic diseases. For instance, the hazard ratio of COPD and obesity for individuals in the top T2D PXS deciles was 2.82 (95% CI 2.39-3.35, P = 4.00 × 10-33) and 2.54 (95% CI 2.24-2.87, P = 9.86 × 10-50), respectively, compared to the remaining population. We also found that PXS and PGS were both significantly (P < 0.0001) and positively associated with the total number of incident diseases.T2D shares polyexposure risks with other common chronic diseases. Individuals with an elevated genetic and non-genetic risk of T2D also have high risks of cardiovascular, liver, lung, and kidney diseases.",

The patient was previously on insulin therapy with sensor augmented pump and we switched him to Hybrid Closed Loop shortly before the begin of dialysis. Results Automated insulin delivery produced an increase of time in range (70-180 mg/dl) from 63% to 72%, after 3 months and to 74% after one year. Moreover, no hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia urgencies occurred overall during the year. Conclusions The case detailed here is the first report of Hybrid Closed Loop in a patient on automated peritoneal dialysis and it shows an improvement of time in range with a satisfying safety profile in a fragile, aged patient.",

Methods This is a retrospective, multicenter, non-inferiority study based on electronic medical records. All patients initiating Gla-300 or Deg-100 were 1:1 propensity score-matched (PSM). Linear mixed models were used to assess the changes in continuous endpoints. Incidence rates (IR) of hypoglycemia were compared using Poisson’s regression models. Results Nineteen centers provided data on 357 patients in each PSM cohort. HbA1c after 6 months (primary endpoint) decreased by − 1.70% (95%CI − 1.90; − 1.50) in Gla-300 group and − 169% (95%CI − 1.89; − 1.49) in Deg-100 group, confirming non-inferiority of Gla-300 versus Deg-100. Fasting blood glucose (BG) decreased by ~60 mg/dl in both groups; body weight remained unchanged. In both groups, the mean starting dose was 12U (0.15U/kg) and it was slightly titrated to 16U (0.20U/kg). IR (episodes per patient-months) of BG ≤70 mg/dl was 0.13 in Gla-300 group and 0.14 in Deg-100 group ( p =0.87). IR of BG &lt;54 mg/dL was 0.02 in both groups ( p =0.49). No severe hypoglycemia occurred. Conclusion Initiating Gla-300 or Deg-100 was associated with similar improvements in glycemic control, no weight gain and low hypoglycemia rates, without severe episodes during 6 months of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM) can lead to emotional distress and cognitive impairments, often caused by psychological factors such as low mood or anxiety; yet, few studies have explored the theoretical mechanisms underlying these relationships and within one study. This study explored the relationships between psychological states (anxiety/worry, fatigue) and diabetes outcomes (diabetes distress, cognitive dysfunction), and whether resilience mediated the association between these in T1DM and T2DM. Methods A sample of 307 UK adults with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes (T1DM = 129; T2DM = 178) completed a cross-sectional online survey, composed of six questionnaires. Associations between variables were investigated using Pearson’s correlations and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Results Psychological states were significantly correlated with diabetes outcomes, and resilience was significantly related to both psychological states and diabetes outcomes. The SEM model achieved an acceptable model fit with a significant mediating effect of resilience between psychological states (anxiety/worry, fatigue) and diabetes outcomes (diabetes distress, cognitive dysfunction), with no significant differences between diabetes type. Conclusions We propose a new theoretical model of T1DM and T2DM that could be used to provide guidance for those designing interventions. These findings help to understand the complex nature of diabetes management, suggesting resilience could be a key factor in managing psychological states and diabetes outcomes.",

    "abstract": "This prospective study focuses on risk factors for arterial damage in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D).Eighty children and adolescents with T1D were investigated twice, approximately 2 years apart, for carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) and compliance (CAC), flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, and plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8. All subjects were genotyped for HLA. The number of respiratory tract infections (RTI) during the past year was obtained by a questionnaire in 56 patients.cIMT progression, defined as percentage (%) change of cIMT from baseline, correlated inversely with the % changes of both CAC (p = 0.04, r = - 0.3; n = 62) and FMD (p = 0.03, r = - 0.3; n = 47). In multivariate analysis, RTI frequency correlated significantly with cIMT progression irrespective of age, diabetes duration, BMI, and HbA1c (p = 0.03, r = 0.3). When patients were divided in relation to RTI, the association of DQ2/8 with cIMT progression remained significant in patients with over three infections/year (p = 0.04, r = 0.3). During follow-up, the group of DQ2/8 patients with hsCRP > 1 mg/l showed significantly higher levels of plasma MMP-8 than the non-DQ2/8 group.The diabetes-risk genotype DQ2/8 and systemic inflammation contribute to pro-atherosclerotic vascular changes in children and adolescents with T1D.",

Methods This is a retrospective observational study (72 eyes/65 patients). Best-corrected visual acuity, timing of DME recurrence, and SD-OCT pattern [intraretinal cysts (IRC), IRC plus subretinal fluid (mixed), external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid (IS/OS) layer integrity] were assessed at baseline and monthly until first DME recurrence. Results Forty-two (58.3%) and 30 (41.6%) DME eyes had an IRC and mixed DME pattern at baseline, respectively. Twenty-four out of thirty mixed eyes (80%) relapsed without subretinal fluid. At baseline, mixed eyes showed similar changes in ELM and IS/OS (60 and 76.6% of eyes, respectively) versus IRC eyes (42.8 and 80.9% of eyes). After DME recurrence, more mixed eyes at baseline showed ELM and IS/OS changes (63.3 and 86.6%) than IRC eyes (50 and 76.2%). 33.3% of mixed eyes had DME recurrence at ≥ 6 months from first DEX-I implant versus 19% of IRC eyes. Conclusions Mixed DME eyes were treated with DEX-I relapse later and more frequently without subretinal fluid than IRC eyes. SD-OCT characteristics of different DME patterns at baseline can predict morphological features and timing of DME recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Steroid diabetes mellitus (SDM) is a metabolic syndrome caused by an increase in glucocorticoids, and its pathogenesis is unclear. 18 F-FDG PET/CT can reflect the glucose metabolism of tissues and organs under living conditions. Here, PET/CT imaging of SDM and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats was used to visualize changes in glucose metabolism in the main glucose metabolizing organs and investigate the pathogenesis of SDM. Methods SDM and T2DM rat models were established. During this time, PET/CT imaging was used to measure the %ID/g value of skeletal muscle and liver to evaluate glucose uptake. The pancreatic, skeletal muscle and liver were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results SDM rats showed increased fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, hyperplasia of islet α and β cells, increased FDG uptake in skeletal muscle accompanied by an up-regulation of PI3Kp85α, IRS-1, and GLUT4, no significant changes in liver uptake, and that glycogen storage in the liver and skeletal muscle increased. T2DM rats showed atrophy of pancreatic islet β cells and decreased insulin levels, significantly reduced FDG uptake and glycogen storage in skeletal muscle and liver. Conclusions The pathogenesis of SDM is different from that of T2DM. The increased glucose metabolism of skeletal muscle may be related to the increased compensatory secretion of insulin. Glucocorticoids promote the proliferation of islet α cells and cause an increase in gluconeogenesis in the liver, which may cause increased blood glucose.",

    "abstract": "Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is the most common form of monogenic diabetes in Europe, affecting between 1 and 6% of diabetic patients. It comprises a group of heterogeneous genetic disorders characterized by early onset of diabetes (commonly before age 25), absence of autoimmunity, and beta-cell dysfunction. So far, mutations in 14 different genes involved in glucose homeostasis and pancreatic development [1] have been associated with this disease. Although it is an autosomal dominant disorder, de novo mutations should be taken into consideration in patients without a family history of diabetes. Most cases of MODY are due to mutations in GCK, HNF1a, HNF4a and HNF1b, previously known as MODY2, MODY3, MODY1, and MODY5, respectively. Among these, HNF1b is an active transcription factor that forms homodimers or heterodimers with HNF1a and plays a fundamental role in kidney development, nephron differentiation, and pancreatic growth and differentiation. Mutations in this gene lead to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, genital malformations, pancreatic atrophy with endocrine and exocrine deficiency [2]. Diabetes usually onsets in early adulthood and frequently requires insulin treatment.\r\n\r\nWe present an unusual case of a prenatal diagnosis that revealed a mutation in the HNF1b gene responsible for neonatal hyperglycemia in a pregnant woman affected by X-linked ectodermal dysplasia.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether blood glucose test strip (BGTS) utilization in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with the type of diabetes therapy, classified according to hypoglycemic risk. A retrospective, longitudinal (2006–2012) study of Canadian private drug plans (PDP) and Ontario Public Drug Programs (OPDP) prescription claims was conducted. Analyses were restricted to patients with T2D with or without a claim for BGTS. Daily BGTS utilization (TS/patient/day) was evaluated by diabetes therapy classified by hypoglycemic risk. Multivariate analyses were conducted to identify determinants of BGTS utilization. The T2D cohort comprised 5,759,591 observations from 1,949,129 claimants. Mean BGTS utilization was 0.84 TS/patient/day and differed between PDP and OPDP (0.66 vs. 1.00). Daily utilization was greatest in patients receiving therapy associated with a pre-defined high risk of hypoglycemia [insulin: basal + bolus (2.16), premixed (1.65), basal (1.16), other insulin regimens (2.13), and sulfonylureas (0.74)] versus non-sulfonylurea non-insulin-based regimens (0.52). For non-insulin therapy, BGTS utilization was greater for patients on multiple non-insulin therapies versus monotherapy (0.74 vs. 0.53 TS/patient/day). In multivariate analyses, drivers for BGTS utilization included insulin use, previous BGTS use, and female gender. Previous diabetes therapy and duration of therapy were negatively correlated with BGTS utilization. BGTS utilization varies depending on the type of therapy used to treat T2D according to hypoglycemic risk. Decision making regarding BGTS needs to account for robust analyses of current utilization and its value in those settings, including in patients not receiving diabetes therapy and the prevalence of circumstances conducive to more intensive monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The exposure of isolated pancreatic islets to pro-angiogenic factors prior to their transplantation represents a promising strategy to accelerate the revascularization of the grafts. It has been shown that erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein regulating erythropoiesis, also induces angiogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that EPO exposure of isolated islets improves their posttransplant revascularization.Flow cytometric, immunohistochemical and quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR analyses were performed to study the effect of EPO on the viability, cellular composition and gene expression of isolated islets. Moreover, islets expressing a mitochondrial or cytosolic H2O2 sensor were used to determine reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The dorsal skinfold chamber model in combination with intravital fluorescence microscopy was used to analyze the revascularization of transplanted islets.We found that the exposure of isolated islets to EPO (3 units/mL) for 24 h does not affect the viability and the production of ROS when compared to vehicle-treated and freshly isolated islets. However, the exposure of islets to EPO increased the number of CD31-positive cells and enhanced the gene expression of insulin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. The revascularization of the EPO-cultivated islets was accelerated within the initial phase after transplantation when compared to both controls.These findings indicate that the exposure of isolated islets to EPO may be a promising approach to improve clinical islet transplantation.",

    "abstract": "To determine if medium- and long-term blood glucose control as well as glycemic variability, which are known to be strong predictors of vascular complications, are associated with underlying cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) in neurologically asymptomatic individuals with type 1 diabetes.A total of 189 individuals (47.1% men; median age 40.0, IQR 33.0-45.2 years) with type 1 diabetes (median diabetes duration of 21.7, IQR 18.3-30.7 years) were enrolled in a cross-sectional retrospective study, as part of the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values were collected over the course of ten years before the visit including a clinical examination, biochemical sampling, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Markers of glycemic control, measured during the visit, included HbA1c, fructosamine, and glycated albumin.Signs of cSVD were present in 66 (34.9%) individuals. Medium- and long-term glucose control and glycemic variability did not differ in individuals with signs of cSVD compared to those without. Further, no difference in any of the blood glucose variables and cSVD stratified for cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) or white matter hyperintensities were detected. Neither were numbers of CMBs associated with the studied glucose variables. Additionally, after dividing the studied variables into quartiles, no association with cSVD was observed.We observed no association between glycemic control and cSVD in neurologically asymptomatic individuals with type 1 diabetes. This finding was unexpected considering the large number of signs of cerebrovascular pathology in these people after two decades of chronic hyperglycemia and warrants further studies searching for underlying factors of cSVD.",

    "abstract": "Workplace demands, support, and relationships differ according to employment status (e.g., employment that is full-time, part-time, or self-employed) and may lead to unequal opportunities to keep diabetic appointments. We investigated the association between employment status and outpatient diabetic appointment non-attendance among working-age adults with type 2 diabetes.This was a secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized trial (the Japan diabetes outcome intervention trial 2 large-scale trial). The analysis included 2010 trial participants (40-65 years old) with type 2 diabetes who were regularly followed by primary care physicians (PCPs). The outcome measure was the first non-attendance (defined as a failure to visit a PCP within 2 months of the original appointment) during the one-year follow-up. The association between baseline employment status and non-attendance was examined using Cox proportional hazard model in men and women.During the 1279 and 789 person-year follow-up periods, 90 men and 34 women, respectively, experienced their first appointment non-attendance. Among men, self-employed participants had a higher risk of non-attendance compared with full-time employees (adjusted HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.15, 2.95). The trial intervention (attendance promotion) was associated with a significantly reduced risk of non-attendance among self-employed participants (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26, 0.99). Among women, a significant association between employment status and non-attendance was not observed.Self-employed men with type 2 diabetes had a twofold increased risk of non-attendance than did full-time employees. Our study suggests that self-employed men with type 2 diabetes should be targeted for interventions promoting appointment adherence.",

By means of a novel haptic device, tactile sensitivity in the fingertip was measured as the ability of the participants to discriminate slip motion speed.Tactile sensitivity was significantly lower in individuals affected by diabetes as compared to controls. Depending on the subgroup, the difference from the controls was equal to 0.11 (95% CI from 0.029 to 0.186) and to 0.267 (95% CI from 0.198 to 0.336). Within the diabetes group, tactile sensitivity correlated with vibration sensitivity in the upper (p = 0.001) and lower limb (p = 0.003). A significant relationship between nerve conduction parameters and tactile sensitivity was found (p = 0.03). Finally, we combined the different predictors (clinical, vibratory and electroneurography data) by using cluster analysis; tactile sensitivity was found to be significantly different between different clusters (p = 0.004).Early signs of tactile dysfunction in the hand were found in individuals affected by diabetes, even in absence of diabetic neuropathy. The protocol presented in this study is a promising tool for the assessment of tactile dysfunction in the hand in people affected by type 1 diabetes.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether women with multiple pregnancies are at a higher risk of developing GDM using nationwide high-quality registers.In this retrospective cohort study, data from the National Medical Birth Register (MBR) was used to evaluate the odds of GDM as a result of multiple pregnancies. We included all pregnancies with a tested GDM recorded in the MBR between 2004 and 2018. A total of 397,810 pregnancies were included in this study. Logistic regression model was used to assess the odds for GDM among multiple pregnancies, when compared to singleton pregnancies. Odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between the groups were compared. The model was adjusted with maternal BMI and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments.A total of 5825 multiple pregnancies and a tested GDM were observed. In the control group, there were 391,985 singleton pregnancies with a tested GDM. Of these, 1791 (30.7%) multiple pregnancies were associated with a diagnosis of GDM. GDM was more common among women with multiple pregnancies (30.7 vs. 25.9%, aOR 1.28; CI 1.21-1.36).The results of this study show that women with multiple pregnancies have a higher odds of developing GDM and should be monitored to prevent the development of GDM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims The introduction of hormonal treatment in severe diabetes in 1922 represented a clinical and social impact similar to that of antibiotic therapy. In October 1923, the Assembly of the Karolinska Institute decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to the Canadian Frederick Grant Banting and the Scottish John James Rickard Macleod, researchers at the University of Toronto (UT), for \"the discovery of insulin a year before\". A few weeks later, European and American researchers protested the decision. The controversy remains to this day. Methods We have conducted a comprehensive review of primary and critical sources focused on the organotherapy of animal and human diabetes mellitus since 1889, when Oskar Minkowski demonstrated the induction of experimental diabetes by total pancreatectomy in the dog, until the spring of 1923, when the Nobel Foundation had already received all the nominations for the award in Physiology or Medicine. Results The in-depth analysis of all these sources revealed that Europe was the cradle of the discovery of the antidiabetic hormone. The discovery involved multiple research steps headed by a long list of key investigators, mainly European. Conclusion Marcel Eugène Émile Gley was the first to demonstrate the presence of the “antidiabetic principle” in extracts from “sclerosed” pancreas. The French physiologist pioneered the successful reduction of glycosuria and diabetic symptoms by the parenteral administration of pancreatic extracts to depancreatized dogs in experiments developed between 1890 and 1905, antedating insulin in two decades.",

    "abstract": "The general objective has been the historiographical investigation of the organotherapy of diabetes mellitus between 1906 and 1923 in its scientific, social and political dimensions, with special emphasis on the most relevant contributions of researchers and institutions and on the controversies generated on the priority of the \"discovery\" of antidiabetic hormone.We have analyzed the experimental procedures and determination of biological parameters used by researchers during the investigated period (1906-1923): pancreatic ablation techniques, induction of acinar atrophy with preservation of pancreatic islets, preparation of pancreatic extracts (PE) with antidiabetic activity, clinical chemistry procedures (glycemia, glycosuria, ketonemia, ketonuria, etc.). The field investigation has included on-site and online visits to cities, towns, buildings, laboratories, universities, museums and research centers where the reported events took place, obtaining documents, photographic images, audiovisual recordings, as well as personal interviews complementary to the documentation consulted (primary sources, critical bibliography, reference works). The documentary archival sources have been classified according to theme, including those consulted in situ with those extracted online and digitized copies received mainly by email. Among the many archives contacted, those listed below have been most useful and have been consulted on site and on repeated visits: National Library of Medicine-Historical Archives (Bethesda, MD, USA); Archives, University of Toronto and Thomas Fisher Rare Books Library (Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Francis A. County Library of Medicine, Harvard University (Boston, Mass, USA); Zentralbibliothek der Humboldt-Universität (Berlin, DE), Geheimarchiv des Preuβischen Staates (Berlin, DE); Landesamt für Bürger-und Ordnungsangelegenheiten (LABO) (Berlin, DE); Arhivele Academiei Române şi Universitǎții Carol Davila (Bucharest, RO).A) The European researchers Zülzer (Z Exp Path Ther 23:307-318, 1908) and Paulescu (CR Seances Soc Biol Fil 85:558, 1921) meet the requirements of the priority rule in the discovery of the antidiabetic hormone. B) Factors of socioeconomic and political nature related with the First World War and the inter-war period delayed the process of purification of the antidiabetic hormone in Europe. C) The Canadian scientist J. Collip, University of Alberta, temporarily assimilated to the University of Toronto, and the American chemist and researcher G. Walden, with the expert collaboration of Eli Lilly & Co., were the main authors of the purification process of the antidiabetic hormone. D) The scientific evidence, reflected in the heuristics of this research, allows to assert that the basic investigation carried out by the Department of Physiology of the University of Toronto, directed by the Scottish J. Macleod, in conjunction with the clinical research undertaken by the Department of Medicine of the University of Toronto (W. Campbell, A. Fletcher, D. Graham) made it possible in record time the successful treatment of patients with what was until then a deadly disease.",

Methods 1478 FDS2 participants with type 2 diabetes (mean age 65.8 years, 51.6% males, median diabetes duration 9.0 years) from the longitudinal, observational Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II (FDS2) were followed from study entry to death or end-2016. Independent associates of a low baseline serum bicarbonate (&lt; 22 mmol/L) were determined using multiple logistic regression. The role of important covariates in influencing the association between bicarbonate and mortality was assessed by a stepwise Cox regression approach. Results A low serum bicarbonate was associated with increased all-cause mortality in unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio (HR) 1.90 (95% confidence limits (CL) 1.39, 2.60 per mmol/L). Mortality remained significantly associated with low serum bicarbonate (HR 1.40 (95% CL 1.01, 1.94) per mmol/L) in a Cox regression model with adjustment for factors associated with mortality but not low serum bicarbonate, but inclusion of estimated glomerular filtration rate categories rendered the association non-significant (HR 1.16 (95% CL 0.83, 1.63) per mmol/L). Conclusions A low serum bicarbonate is not an independent prognostic marker in people with type 2 diabetes but it may be a manifestation of the pathway between the development of impaired renal function and death.",

Gremlin-1 has not yet been investigated in pregnancy, pregnancy-related insulin resistance or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Gremlin-1 levels were measured throughout the pregnancy of 58 women at high risk for GDM at the Medical University of Vienna. Furthermore, an oral glucose tolerance test, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, sex hormones, blood lipids, liver and renal parameters, and markers of bone development were evaluated at two points during pregnancy (< 20 weeks of gestation (GW), GW 24-28) and 12-14 weeks postpartum.Gremlin-1 levels decreased from < 20 GW (mean = 9.2 pg/ml, SD = 8.4 pg/ml) to GW 24-28 (mean = 6.7 pg/ml, SD = 5.7 pg/ml, p = 0.033) and increased again postpartum, albeit not significantly (mean = 10.7 pg/ml, SD = 13.1 pg/ml, p = 0.339). During pregnancy, Gremlin-1 levels correlated negatively with osteocalcin and procollagen type I aminoterminal propeptide (P1NP), markers of bone health. Concerning glucose metabolism, Gremlin-1 levels were inversely related to the Insulinogenic Index at GW < 20. However, Gremlin-1 levels were not significantly different between women with normal glucose tolerance and GDM during pregnancy. Postpartum, Gremlin-1 was associated with the fatty liver index, osteocalcin levels, diastolic blood pressure and weight.Gremlin-1 levels decreased significantly during pregnancy. The biomarker is not related to GDM status, but correlates negatively with the Insulinogenic Index, an index related to beta cell function. Trial Registry Number ACTRN12616000924459.",

Methods N = 179 adults with type 1 diabetes were enrolled during their stay at a tertiary diabetes center (monocentric enrolment) and followed up over three months in a prospective, observational study (‘DIA-LINK1’). Improvement in diabetes distress was assessed as reduction in the Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale score from baseline to follow-up. Resilience (Resilience Scale-13), acceptance (Diabetes Acceptance Scale), and patient characteristics were analyzed as predictors of improvement in diabetes distress using hierarchical multiple regression. Results Greater reductions in diabetes distress were significantly explained by lower diabetes acceptance at baseline ( β = −0.34, p &lt; 0.01), while resilience, diabetes complications, and other person-related variables were not significantly related to changes in diabetes distress (all p &gt; 0.05). When change in diabetes acceptance from baseline to follow-up was added to the model, improved diabetes distress was explained by increasing diabetes acceptance ( β = 0.41, p &lt; 0.01) and a shorter duration of diabetes ( β = -0.18, p = 0.03), while baseline diabetes acceptance was no longer significantly associated ( β = −0.14, p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions Diabetes acceptance is inversely related to diabetes distress, and increasing acceptance explained greater improvement in diabetes distress. These findings suggest that increasing diabetes acceptance may facilitate the reduction of diabetes distress. Treatment approaches targeting acceptance might be useful for the mental healthcare of people with type 1 diabetes and clinically elevated diabetes distress.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Glomerular damage and proximal tubular damage play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the urinary markers of proximal tubular injury, including urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein-to-creatinine ratio (uL-FABP/Cr) and urinary N -acetyl-β- d -glucosaminidase-to-creatinine ratio (uNAG/Cr), and glycemic control status. Methods This cross-sectional study included 245 and 39 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-T2DM (NDM), respectively. The participants of this study were fitted with retrospective CGM, and glycemic control indices, such as time in range (TIR) and glycemia risk index (GRI), were calculated. Results The results were presented as medians (interquartile ranges). The uL-FABP/Cr was significantly higher in the microalbuminuria than in the normo-albuminuria group [4.2 (2.7–7.1) and 2.2 (1.4–3.4) μg/gCr, respectively, P &lt; 0.001], while the uNAG/Cr in the normo-albuminuria group [6.3 (4.5–10.1) U/gCr] was significantly higher than that in the NDM group [5.3 (3.8–6.3) U/gCr, P = 0.048] but significantly lower than that in the microalbuminuria group [9.2 (6.4–11.1) U/gCr, P = 0.004]. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that CGM-derived TIR was significantly associated with the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [uAlb/Cr, odds ratio (OR) 0.985, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.971–0.998, P = 0.029] and uNAG/Cr (OR 0.973, 95% CI 0.957–0.989, P = 0.001) independent of renal function. GRI was similarly associated with uAlb/Cr and uNAG/Cr. Conclusion The findings of this study indicated that uNAG/Cr was elevated before albuminuria development and was associated with CGM-derived TIR and GRI.",

    "abstract": "Insulin possesses both vasodilatory and sympathomimetic activities. The aim was to examine the relationship between changes in insulin exposure and arterial stiffness in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Patients with T2D with (n = 22) or without (n = 24) albuminuria, and non-diabetic controls (n = 25) were randomized to a crossover study having a breakfast with or without pre-meal rapid-acting insulin. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured at 30 min before and at 60-min intervals up to 240 min after the breakfast. At baseline, both postprandial aortic (p = 0.022) and brachial (p = 0.011) PWV were higher in individuals with T2D than in healthy controls irrespective of the presence of albuminuria. In patients with albuminuria, weight-adjusted insulin dose correlated inversely with the excursion of the aortic (r = − 0.412, p = 0.006) and brachial (r = − 0.372; p = 0.014) PWV. Similarly, circulating endogenous insulin concentrations correlated inversely with the aortic (r = − 0.347, p = 0.026) and brachial (r = − 0.622, p = <0.001) PWV. No correlations between insulin and PWV were observed in patients without albuminuria or in healthy controls. The inverse correlation between insulin and PWV in T2D with albuminuria may reflect a vasorelaxing effect of insulin. The study was registered (clinicaltrials.gov) with the identifier of NCT01159938.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims The population of immigrants from the Middle East in Sweden show a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to native Swedes. The exact reason for this is unknown. Here, we have performed metabolite profiling to investigate these differences. Methods Metabolite profiling was conducted in Iraqi immigrants ( n = 93) and native Swedes ( n = 77) using two complementary mass spectrometry-based platforms. Differences in metabolite levels were compared after adjustment for confounding anthropometric, diet and clinical variables. Results The Iraqi immigrant population were more obese (44.1 vs 24.7%, p &lt; 0.05), but had a lower prevalence of hypertension (32.3 vs 54.8%, p &lt; 0.01) than the native Swedish population. We detected 140 metabolites, 26 of which showed different levels between populations ( q &lt; 0.05,) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, T2D and use of metformin. Twenty-two metabolites remained significant after further adjustment for HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta or insulin sensitivity index. Levels of polyunsaturated acylcarnitines (14:2 and 18:2) and fatty acid (18:2) were higher, whereas those of saturated and monounsaturated acylcarnitines (14:0, 18:1, and 8:1), fatty acids (12:0, 14:0, 16:0, and 18:1), uremic solutes (urate and quinate) and ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate) were lower in Iraqi immigrants. Further, levels of phospholipids were generally lower in the Iraqi immigrant population. Conclusions Our result suggests an overall beneficial lipid profile in Iraqi immigrants, despite a higher risk to develop T2D. Higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids may suggest differences in dietary pattern, which in turn may reduce the risk of hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni leaf extracts have gained increasing attention for their potential protection against type 2 diabetes. In this study, we have evaluated the possible beneficial effects of Stevia rebaudiana leaf extracts on beta-cells exposed to lipotoxicity and explored some of the possible mechanisms involved. Methods Extracts, deriving from six different chemotypes (ST1 to ST6), were characterized in terms of steviol glycosides, total phenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity. INS-1E beta cells and human pancreatic islets were incubated 24 h with 0.5 mM palmitate with or without varying concentrations of extracts. Beta-cell/islet cell features were analyzed by MTT assay, activated caspase 3/7 measurement, and/or nucleosome quantification. In addition, the proteome of INS-1E cells was assessed by bi-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Results The extracts differed in terms of antioxidant activity and stevioside content. As expected, 24 h exposure to palmitate resulted in a significant decrease of INS-1E cell metabolic activity, which was counteracted by all the Stevia extracts at 200 μg/ml. However, varying stevioside only concentrations were not able to protect palmitate-exposed cells. ST3 extract was also tested with human islets, showing an anti-apoptotic effect. Proteome analysis showed several changes in INS-1E beta-cells exposed to ST3, mainly at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial levels. Conclusions Stevia rebaudiana leaf extracts have beneficial effects on beta cells exposed to lipotoxicity; this effect does not seem to be mediated by stevioside alone (suggesting a major role of the leaf phytocomplex as a whole) and might be due to actions on the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondrion.",

    "abstract": "The two predominant pathophysiological defects resulting in glucose intolerance are beta-cell dysfunction and insulin insensitivity. This study aimed to re-examine beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity across a continuum from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to early type 2 diabetes (T2DM) employing highly specific insulin, C-peptide and intact proinsulin assays.A total of 104 persons with NGT, 85 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 554 with newly diagnosed T2DM were investigated. Following an overnight fast, all underwent a 4-h standardised mixed meal tolerance test (MTT), and on a second day, a sub-group underwent a frequently sampled insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT) over a 3-h period. The participants were stratified according to fasting glucose and BMI for analysis.The MTT revealed that increasing FPG was accompanied by progressively elevated and delayed postprandial glucose peaks. In parallel, following an initial compensatory increase in fasting and postprandial insulin responses there followed a progressive demise in overall beta-cell secretory capacity. FSIVGTT demonstrated a major reduction in the early insulin response to IV glucose in persons with IGT accompanied by a dramatic fall in insulin sensitivity. Beyond pre-diabetes, ever-increasing fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia resulted predominantly from a progressively decreasing beta-cell secretory function.This study utilising improved assay technology re-affirms that beta-cell dysfunction is evident throughout the spectrum of glucose intolerance, whereas the predominant fall in insulin sensitivity occurs early in its evolution.",

    "abstract": "To compare the influence of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) on the risk of lower extremity amputations in patients with type 2 diabetes in Slovenia.This retrospective cohort study included patients aged 40 years or more who were administered a newly introduced SGLT2i or DPP-4i between June 2014 and June 2018. Patients treated with insulin at baseline and patients with a history of amputation were excluded. Patients were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity score matching. Survival analysis was performed; hazard ratio (HR) and ratios of cumulative hazards at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were estimated. On-treatment and intention-to-treat approaches were used.The study cohort (mean age: 64 years) consisted of 2,939 new users of SGLT2i (empagliflozin, 59%; dapagliflozin, 41%) matched to 2,939 new users of DPP-4i. In the on-treatment analysis (median follow-up of 2 years), the incidence of amputations was higher in SGLT2i than in DPP-4i users (4.2 vs. 2.7 per 1,000 patient years), resulting in a HR of 1.58 (95% CI 0.85-2.92; p = 0.145). An intention-to-treat analysis yielded to similar HR of 1.86 (95% CI: 1.10-3.14; p = 0.020). There was no difference in amputation rates in the first two years, but SGLT2i users had a 2.81-fold higher (95% CI: 1.63-4.84; p = 0.007) cumulative hazard of amputation at 4 years than did DPP-4i users.Compared with DPP-4i use, SGLT2i use did not result in a statistically significant higher overall risk of lower extremity amputations. However, the results suggest that SGLT2i may increase the risk of amputation with long-term use.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim Women with prior gestational diabetes (GDM) are at increased diabetes risk. This study aimed to assess whether lifestyle is associated with glycemic health of high-risk women 5 years postpartum, taking into account the pre-pregnancy BMI. Methods The RADIEL study enrolled before or in early pregnancy 720 women with pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 and/or prior GDM. The follow-up visit 5 years postpartum included questionnaires and measurements of anthropometrics, blood pressure, and physical activity (PA) as well as analyses of glucose metabolism, lipids, and inflammatory markers. We measured body composition (Inbody) and calculated a Healthy Food Intake Index (HFII) from Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ). ArmBand measured PA, sedentary time, and sleep. To take into account the diverse risk groups of GDM, we divided the women based on pre-pregnancy BMI over/under 30 kg/m 2 . Results Altogether 348 women attended the follow-up. The obese and non-obese women showed similar prevalence of glycemic abnormalities, 13% and 19% ( p = 0.139). PA levels were higher among the non-obese women ( p &lt; 0.05), except for step count, and their HFII was higher compared to the obese women ( p = 0.033). After adjusting for age, education, and GDM history, PA and HFII were associated with glycemic health only among obese women. When both lifestyle factors were in the same model, only PA remained significant. PA associated with other markers of metabolic health also among the non-obese women, excluding HbA1c. Conclusion Lifestyle 5 years postpartum was associated with better glycemic health only among the obese high-risk women. PA, however, is essential for the metabolic health of all high-risk women.

    "abstract": "Our aim was to compare the effects of an intermediate acting human insulin (NPH) and a long-acting insulin analog, insulin glargine, in insulin naïve type 2 diabetes patients, stratified by the type of hyperglycemia (fasting or postprandial type). Based on different action profiles, we hypothesized that patients having different hyperglycemia types would react differently when treated with these insulins. This is a post hoc analysis of the Lanmet study data. The Lanmet study was a randomized, 36-week controlled insulin initiation study in type 2 diabetes patients. 109 subjects with baseline HbA1c >8.0 % (64 mmol/mol) completed the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to fasting glucose (mmol/l)/HbA1c (%) ratio. Patients with a ratio ≥1.3 were defined as having fasting type and those with a ratio <1.3 as having postprandial type hyperglycemia. The main outcome measures were change in HbA1c and body weight, and final insulin dose. Independently of insulin type, compared to patients with postprandial type hyperglycemia, those with fasting type hyperglycemia had 2.1 kg/m2 greater initial BMI (p = 0.044), gained 2.0 kg more weight (p = 0.020, adjusted for baseline BMI p = 0.035), and had 36 % greater final insulin dose/kg (p = 0.001). With respect to hyperglycemia type, there was no difference between NPH and glargine in their effects on HbA1c. When starting bedtime insulin in type 2 diabetes patients, those with fasting type hyperglycemia are prone to greater weight gain. Hyperglycemia type does not help in identifying patients who would benefit specially from either NPH insulin or insulin glargine.",

Methods 3 Screen is designed for combined detection of autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), to the islet antigen IA-2 (IA-2A) and to zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A), while 2 Screen detects GADA and IA-2A. Serum samples from 100 T1D patients at onset and 200 healthy controls were studied. Results 3 Screen achieved 93% assay sensitivity and 97.5% specificity, while 2 Screen achieved 91% assay sensitivity and 98.5% specificity. Samples were also tested in assays for individual autoantibodies. There was only one 3 Screen positive healthy control sample (0.5%) that was positive for multiple autoantibodies (IA-2A and ZnT8A). In contrast, most of the 93 3 Screen positive patients were positive for multiple autoantibodies with 72% (67/93) positive for both GADA and IA-2A and 57% (53/93) positive for three autoantibodies (GADA, IA-2A and ZnT8A). Insulin autoantibodies (IAA, measured by radioimmunoassay) were positive in 13 patients and two healthy controls. Conclusion 3 Screen achieved high sensitivity and specificity, suitable for islet cell autoimmunity screening in a healthy population. In the case of 3 Screen positivity, further assays for GADA, IA-2A and ZnT8A are required to check for multiple autoantibody positivity, a hallmark for progression to T1D. In addition, testing for IAA in children below two years of age is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim There is little evidence of the impact of diabetes risk scores on individual diabetes risk factors, motivation for behaviour changes and mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of applying a noninvasive diabetes risk score in primary care as component of routine health checks on physical activity and secondary outcomes. Methods Cluster randomised trial, in which primary care physicians (PCPs), randomised (1:1) by minimisation, enrolled participants with statutory health insurance without known diabetes, ≥ 35 years of age with a body mass index ≥ 27.0 kg/m 2 . The German Diabetes Risk Score was applied as add-on to the standard routine health check, conducted in the controls. Primary outcome was the difference in participants’ physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) after 12 months. Secondary outcomes included body mass index, perceived health, anxiety, depression, and motivation for lifestyle change. Analysis was by intention-to-treat principle using mixed models. Results 36 PCPs were randomised; remaining 30 PCPs (intervention: n = 16; control: n = 14) recruited 315 participants (intervention: n = 153; controls: n = 162). A slight increase in physical activity was observed in the intervention group with an adjusted mean change of 388 (95% confidence interval: − 235; 1011) metabolic equivalents minutes per week. There were no relevant changes in secondary outcomes. Conclusions The application of a noninvasive diabetes risk score alone is not effective in promoting physical activity in primary care.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims To assess lipid trajectories throughout pregnancy in relation to early postpartum glucose intolerance in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods This prospective cohort study included 221 Chinese women with GDM who completed plasma lipid test in each trimester of pregnancy and oral glucose tolerance test at 6–9 weeks postdelivery between January 1, 2018 and January 8, 2020. Using the group-based trajectory modeling, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol(HDL-c) were identified separately as three trajectories: low, moderate, and high trajectory. The associations between lipid trajectories and early postpartum glucose intolerance were all evaluated. Results Seventy-three participants developed postpartum glucose intolerance. For patients in low, moderate and high trajectory, the incidence of postpartum glucose intolerance was 38.4%, 34.9%, and 17.9%, respectively. GDM women with lower LDL-c trajectories presented a higher risk of postpartum glucose intolerance. The adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for glucose intolerance was 3.14 (1.17–8.39) in low LDL-c trajectory and 2.68 (1.05–6.85) in moderate trajectory when compared with the high one. However, TC trajectory was not associated with the risk of postpartum glucose intolerance, nor were TG trajectory and HDL-c trajectory. Moreover, a significant difference of insulin sensitivity was observed in participants with different LDL-c trajectories; participants in high LDL-c trajectory had the highest insulin sensitivity, whereas the women in low LDL-c trajectory had the lowest insulin sensitivity ( P = 0.02). Conclusions The high trajectory of LDL-c during pregnancy may play a protective role on postpartum glucose intolerance in women with GDM. Further studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanism. Trial registration The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (reference number: [2014]No. 93). All participants provided written informed consent forms, and the ethics committee approved this consent procedure.",

We aimed to analyse NNTs in CVOTs comparing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, or sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors to placebo. Methods We digitalized individual time-to-event information for the primary outcome and all-cause mortality from 19 CVOTs that compared DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or SGLT2 inhibitors to placebo. We estimated Weibull models for each trial and outcome and derived monthly NNTs. NNTs were summarized across all trials and within drug classes by random effects meta-analysis methods. Results Treatment effects in the CVOTs appear smaller if they are reported as NNTs: Overall, 100 (95%-CI: 60, 303) patients have to be treated for 29 months (the median follow-up time across all trials) to avoid a single event of the primary outcome, and 128 (95%-CI: 85, 265) patients have to be treated for 39 months to avoid a single death. NNT time courses are very similar for GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors, whereas treatment effects with DPP-4 inhibitors are smaller. Conclusions We found that the respective treatment effects look less impressive when communicated on an absolute scale, as numbers needed to treat. For a valid overall picture of the benefit of new antidiabetic drugs, trial authors should also report treatment effects on an absolute scale.",

No data are available on the potential role of polymorphisms in miRNAs genes in predisposing T1D subjects to these signs. Aims To determine whether MIR146A rs2910164 and MIR128A rs11888095 polymorphisms are associated with early retinal and corneal neurodegenerative changes in pediatric patients with T1D. Methods A total of 140 T1D children/adolescents underwent spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) with measurement of retinal and corneal nerve fiber parameters. Risk factors for diabetes complications (diabetes duration, blood pressure, HbA1c) were recorded. Genotyping of rs2910164 and rs1188095 SNPs and genotype–phenotype association analysis were performed. Results The C allele of rs2910164 in MIR146A was associated with higher values of IVCM parameters and minimum rim width (MRW) of the peripapillary region of optic nerve head measured in the retina, whereas the T allele of rs1188095 in MIR128A was associated with a significant impairment of them. Multiple regression analysis showed that MIR146A and MIR128A polymorphisms were significantly associated with corneal nerve fiber length (beta = 0.225 and − 0.204, respectively) and other IVCM parameters, independently from age, diabetes duration, HbA1c and systolic blood pressure percentile. Similar results were found for MRW (beta = 0.213 and − 0.286, respectively). Conclusions These results provide new insight into the genetic predisposition to DN showing that two polymorphisms in MIR146A and MIR128A genes could significantly contribute to the development of early ocular preclinical signs of DN.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose To evaluate longitudinal changes in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) metrics in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods This prospective observational cohort study included thirty-two eyes from thirty T1D children with no history of diabetic retinopathy (DR) who were followed up for 4 years. Participants underwent OCTA examinations at baseline and during follow-up. Quantitative OCTA metrics were measured using a customized MATLAB algorithm. Generalized mixed-effect models were used to determine their relationship with DR development. Systemic parameters and OCTA metrics were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to identify predictors for visual function. Results Over the 4-year period, seven of the included eyes developed DR, and most OCTA metrics decreased with diabetes duration. Higher peripapillary and parafoveal nasal quadrant vessel area density (VAD) in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and vessel skeleton density (VSD) in both the SCP and the deep capillary plexus (DCP) were associated with a lower risk of DR in T1D. Parafoveal DCP VSD and VAD in the temporal and inferior quadrants were anticorrelated with changes in best corrected visual acuity. Conclusions OCTA metrics dynamically change over the duration of diabetes and can be used as biomarkers to improve the risk evaluation of DR development and visual function in T1D children and adolescents.",

Methods Four hundred T1D individuals were enrolled in a prospective real-word study with an intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring device during the 12-months follow-up. The primary endpoint was the incidence of severe hypoglycemic events. Results 82% of subjects were naïve to the use of the device (group A) and 18% were already wearing the system (group B). The cumulative incidence of severe hypoglycemia (SH) at 12 months was 12.06 per 100 person-year (95% CI: 8.35–16.85) in group A and 10.14 (95% CI: 4.08–20.90) in group B without inter-group differences. In group A there was a significant decrease in SH at 12 months compared to 3 months period ( p = 0.005). Time in glucose range significantly increased in both groups accompanied with a significant decrease in glucose variability. HbA1c showed a progressive significant time-dependent decrease in group A. The use of the device significantly improved the perceived quality of life. Conclusion This study confirmed the effectiveness of the isCGM in reducing hypoglycemic risk without glucose deterioration, with potential benefits on adverse outcomes in T1D individuals.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Diastolic dysfunction represents the earliest and most common manifestation of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator and anti-inflammatory mediator released from the subendocardial and coronary endothelium, favors left ventricular distensibility and relaxation. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), the NO bioavailability is reduced due to the oxidative stress and inflammatory state of the endothelium, because of chronic hyperglycemia. The aim of the present research is to evaluate the relationship between endothelial function and diastolic function in subjects with T2D. Method Subjects with T2D and age and sex-matched healthy controls were consecutively recruited. All participants underwent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) to assess endothelial function, and echocardiography to evaluate diastolic function. Results Thirty-five patients (6 women, 29 men) and 35 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. FMD was significantly lower in T2D than controls (4.4 ± 3.4 vs. 8.5 ± 4.3%, p = 0.001). T2D presented different abnormalities in diastolic function compared to controls: lower E/A (early to late diastolic transmitral flow velocity), lower septal and lateral e′ (early diastolic myocardial tissue velocity at septum and lateral wall), and higher E/e′ (surrogate of filling pressure). In subjects with T2D, we observed a significant correlation between FMD and E/e′ (r = −0.63, p = 0.001), lateral e′ (r = 0.44, p = 0.03), and septal e′ (r = 0.39, p = 0.05). Conclusions Our observational study demonstrated a link between FMD and diastolic dysfunction in subjects with type 2 diabetes.",

Materials and methodsM-LP/Mpv17L-KO mice were generated on a C57BL/6 N background as described in our previous paper [3].The design of the animal experiment was approved by the Committee for Animal Experiments of the University of Fukui.Eight-week-old male WT and M-LP/Mpv17L-KO mice were fasted for 18 h before induction of diabetes using STZ (Fujifilm Wako, Osaka, Japan).The WT mice and the M-LP/Mpv17L-KO mice were each randomly and equally allocated to treatment with either a single dose of 100 mg/ kg STZ dissolved in 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 4.5 (STZtreated) or vehicle alone (controls) via intraperitoneal injection.Thus, 4 groups of 5 mice were created: (i) WT-control; (ii) WT + STZ; (iii) KO-control; and (iv) KO + STZ.Blood glucose levels were measured one day before STZ administration, then on days 8 and 13 after administration using a FreeStyle Freedom Lite (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL).Thirteen days after STZ administration, the mice were killed by carbon dioxide inhalation, and the pancreas of each animal was dissected out and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer solution for 24 h, then embedded in paraffin for histological analysis.Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used for direct microscopic examination.The cross-sectional area of pancreatic islet cell nuclei was measured using the MicroStudio software package (Wraymer, Osaka, Japan).RNA preparation and quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR) analysis were performed as described in our previous paper [3].All of the assays were performed at least 3 times, and the results were presented as mean ± S.D.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a grave complication and the most common renal dysfunction of diabetes mellitus. Genetic factors, including Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) isoforms, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of DN. Methods A total of 577 type 2 Diabetes mellitus subjects were categorized into diabetes non-nephropathic (Controls: n = 321), diabetes nephropathic (DN: n = 256) groups. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters including age, BMI, lipid profiles (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG), glucose metabolism (plasma glucose, HbA1c, serum insulin), renal function (UACR, PCR), and blood pressure (SBP, DBP) were assessed. APOE variant frequencies were determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, validated against Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and statistically correlated with each clinical and biochemical parameter. Results The DN group had an increased prevalence of hypertension, fatty liver, and dyslipidemia compared to the Control group. Biochemical analyses revealed elevated levels of TC (213.41 mg/dL vs. 189.32 mg/dL), LDL-C (134.46 mg/dL vs. 107.56 mg/dL), and reduced HDL-C (58.13 mg/dL vs. 65.32 mg/dL) in DN cases compared to Controls (all p &lt; 0.0001). The APOE variants distribution showed a significant increase in E2 allele frequency (69.1% vs. 15.3%) and corresponding homozygous genotype (E2/2: 42.2% vs. 5.6%) in DN cohorts. Conclusion The study found a higher frequency of E2 allele in the DN group compared to Controls, though no statistically significant risk of DN was linked to this allele. The results suggest a potential association for APOE polymorphisms, requiring broader studies to clarify the role of APOE polymorphisms in DN susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The MiniMed™ 780G system is an advanced insulin pump system incorporating an AHCL (Advanced Hybrid Close Loop) algorithm that automatically adjusts insulin delivery based on glucose levels. All guidelines recommend the use of Automated Insulin Delivery therapy for people with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D) and they highlight that a specifically trained and expert team should provide training on HCL systems for PWT1D, but none of the publications detail the curriculum profile that diabetes educators should have. This paper aims to establish a consensus on the optimal educational pathway for diabetes educators on the MiniMed™ 780G system. Methods An Expert Panel (EP) of 11 key opinion educators in diabetes technology in the EMEA area was assembled. Using the Delphi method, a consensus questionnaire based on the literature research was created, discussed and validated by the EP members. An agreement level of ≥ 75% was considered a strong consensus. Results EP members had on average 16.3 years of clinical experience and followed at least 50 PWT1D using the MiniMed™ 780G system. All EP members agreed that a structured educational pathway to train diabetes educators in the use of the MiniMed™ 780G system is needed. 100% of the EP members agreed that the pathway should include a mentorship programme and in-field training; 90% agreed on using face-to-face training with the support of e-learning modules. The EP members believed that minimum competency standards for diabetes educators around the principles of diabetes care and education are needed. Conclusion The educational pathway created by the EP showed that skills are needed at an advanced level and that mentorship in developing these skills is critical. This pathway is vital for supporting the implementation of diabetes technology into everyday life and can remove barriers and increase access to PWT1D.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is a severe complication of diabetes, estimated to affect up to 44% in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 73% in type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on clinical studies. Currently, the assessment of diabetic autonomic neuropathy is not implemented in Denmark’s clinical guidelines, complicating the estimation of the true prevalence. Thus, this study investigated the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of autonomic dysfunction in people living with diabetes in the North Denmark Region using the Composite Autonomic Symptoms Score (COMPASS)-31 questionnaire. Methods In 2022, all adults with T1D or T2D in the North Denmark Region ( n = 29,155) were identified using The National Health Insurance Service Registry and invited to an online survey including the Danish version of COMPASS-31. The prevalence and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for symptomatic autonomic dysfunction were determined using a cut-off value of 16. Results In total, 7,377 completed COMPASS-31, of which 82.4% reported having T2D and 13.7% T1D. The prevalence of symptomatic autonomic dysfunction was 36.8% (95% CI: 34–40) after a median of 26 years with diabetes for T1D and 44.2% (95% CI: 43–45) after a median of 10 years for T2D. Pupillary and orthostatic intolerance were the most frequent moderate to severe symptoms, respectively (38.4% and 24.0% in T1D and 32.8% and 26.3% in T2D). Conclusion Symptoms of autonomic dysfunction are very common in individuals with diabetes living in the North Denmark Region, emphasizing the unmet need for regular testing to increase awareness and allow for adequate management, ultimately reducing the morbidity of diabetes.",

Methods Prospective observational study conducted during two pandemic waves in 2020–2021. Glucose sensor metrics of 7-day recording were obtained from blinded CGM. Respiratory function was evaluated as arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio (PaO 2 :FiO 2 ). Results PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio was positively correlated with time in tight range (TITR) 70–140 (r = 0.49, p &lt; 0.001) and time in range (TIR) 70–180 (r = 0.32, p &lt; 0.05), and negatively correlated with average glucose (r =– 0.31, p &lt; 0.05), coefficient of glucose variation (CV) (r =– 0.47, p &lt; 0.01) and time above range (TAR) &gt; 140 (r =– 0.49, p &lt; 0.001). No relations were observed with HbA1c. Multivariate regression analysis showed that normal respiratory function at time of CGM removal correlated positively with TITR 70–140 mg/dL (p &lt; 0.01), negatively with CV and TAR &gt; 140 mg/dL (both p &lt; 0.05) and not with TIR 70–180 and average glucose. Conclusions Lower glucose variability and optimal glucose control, expressed as CV and TITR, are CGM metrics predictive of a better prognosis in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Two prerequisites must be met for the precision treatment approach to be beneficial for treated individuals. First, there must be treatment heterogeneity; second, in case of treatment heterogeneity, clinical predictors to identify people who would benefit from one treatment more than from others must be available. There is an established meta-regression approach to assess these two prerequisites that relies on measuring the variability of a clinical outcome after treatment in placebo-controlled randomised trials. We recently applied this approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes for the clinical outcomes of glycaemic control and body weight and repeat it for the clinical outcome of all-cause mortality. Methods We performed a meta-regression analysis using digitalized individual participant information on time to death from 10 large cardiovascular outcome trials (7563 deaths from 99,746 participants) on DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors with respect to the variability of all-cause mortality and its potential predictors after treatment. Results The adjusted difference in log(SD) values of time to death between the verum and placebo arms was −0.036 (95%-CI: −0.059; −0.013), showing larger variability of time to death in the placebo arms. No clinical predictors were found to explain treatment heterogeneity. Conclusions This analysis suggests that the potential of the precision treatment approach in type 2 diabetes is low, at least with regard to improvement of all-cause mortality in population with high cardiovascular risk. This extends our previous findings for the clinical outcomes of glycaemic control and body weight.",

Physical exercise, together with diet, is a milestone in its management and rehabilitation, although there is still a debate on intensity and duration of training. Anaerobic threshold (AT) is a broad term often used either as ventilatory threshold or as lactate threshold, respectively, detected by respiratory ventilation and/or respiratory gases (VCO 2 and VO 2 ), and by blood lactic acid. Aims and methodology This review outlines the role of AT and of the different variations of growth hormone and catecholamine, in subjects with obesity vs normal weight individuals below and beyond AT, during a progressive increase in exercise training. We present a re-evaluation of the effects of physical activity on body mass and metabolism of individuals with obesity in light of potential benefits and pitfalls during COVID-19 pandemic. Comparison of a training program at moderate-intensity exercise (&lt; AT) with training performed at moderate intensity (&lt; AT) plus a final bout of high-intensity (&gt; AT) exercise at the end of the aerobic session will be discussed. Results Based on our data and considerations, a tailored strategy for individuals with obesity concerning the most appropriate intensity of training in the context of rehabilitation is proposed, with special regard to potential benefits of work program above AT. Conclusion Adding bouts of exercise above AT may improve lactic acid and H + disposal and improve growth hormone. Long-term aerobic exercise may improve leptin reduction. In this way, the propensity of subjects with obesity to encounter a serious prognosis of COVID-19 may be counteracted and the systemic and cardiorespiratory sequelae that may ensue after COVID-19, can be overcome. Individuals with serious comorbidities associated with obesity should avoid excessive exercise intensity.",

    "abstract": "Bariatric surgeries induce profound weight loss (decrease in body mass index, BMI), through a decrease in fat mass (FM) and to a much lesser degree of fat-free mass (FFM). Some reports indicate that the weight which is lost after gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is at least partially regained 2 years after surgery. Here we compare changes in BMI and body composition induced by four bariatric procedures in a 5 years follow-up study.We analyzed retrospectively modifications in BMI, FM and FFM obtained through Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) and a long common limb revisional biliopancreatic diversion (reduction of the gastric pouch and long common limb; BPD + LCL-R). Patients were evaluated at baseline and yearly for 5 years. Of the whole cohort of 565 patients, a subset of 180 patients had all yearly evaluations, while the remaining had incomplete evaluations. Setting University Hospital.In a total of 180 patients evaluated yearly for 5 years, decrease in BMI and FM up to 2 years was more rapid with RYGB and SG than BPD and BPD + LCL-R; with RYGB and SG both BMI and FM slightly increased in the years 3-5. At 5 years, the differences were not significant. When analysing the differences between 2 and 5 years, BPD + LCL-R showed a somewhat greater effect on BMI and FM than RYGB, BPD and SG. Superimposable results were obtained when the whole cohort of 565 patients with incomplete evaluation was considered.All surgeries were highly effective in reducing BMI and fat mass at around 2 years; with RYGB and SG both BMI and FM slightly increased in the years 3-5, while BPD and BPD + LCL-R showed a slight further decreases in the same time interval.",

    "abstract": "Inpatient hypoglycaemia is common and associated with adverse outcomes. There is often increased vigilance of hypoglycaemia in inpatients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) compared to type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We aimed to investigate this apparent discrepancy, utilising the time to repeat (TTR) capillary blood glucose (CBG) measurement as a surrogate for engagement with guidelines stating that CBG should be rechecked following intervention within 15 min of an initial CBG of <4 mmol/L.This is an observational study of inpatient CBG data from 8 hospitals over a 7-year period. A national diabetes registry allowed identification of individual's diagnosis and diabetes therapy. For each initial (index) CBG, the TTR for individuals with T2DM-on insulin or sulphonylurea-was compared with the TTR for individuals with T1DM, using a t test for significance performed on log(TTR). The median TTR was plotted for each group per index CBG.In total, 1480,335 CBG measurements were obtained. A total of 26,664 were <4 mmol/L. The TTR in T2DM individuals on sulphonylurea was significantly greater than in T1DM individuals where index CBG was ≥2.3 mmol/L (except index CBG 2.6 mmol/L). For T2DM patients receiving insulin significance exists for index CBGs of ≥3.2 mmol/L.This analysis suggests that quality of care of hypoglycaemia varies according to diagnosis and medication. The group with the highest TTR (T2DM sulphonylurea treated) are possibly the clinical group in whom hypoglycaemia is most concerning. These data therefore suggest a need for education and raising awareness within the inpatient nursing staff.",

    "abstract": "To the Editor,\r\n\r\nIn light of recent findings concerning the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of our previously reported patient, we feel it necessary to briefly review our research and provide updated results.\r\n\r\nIn March 2011, we described the case of a female infant diagnosed with a heterozygous p.Gly223Ser mutation in the glucokinase gene (GCK) [1]. Heterozygous mutations of the GCK gene usually cause a mild clinical phenotype characterized by moderately elevated fasting hyperglycemia with slightly elevated levels of glycated hemoglobin, although the clinical course of diabetes may be highly variable. In contrast, homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in this gene result in early onset of diabetes in the initial days of life, as well as pronounced hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and a severe clinical condition [2].\r\n\r\nAlthough ten family members of the patient are also heterozygous carriers of the p.Gly223Ser mutation, she was the only one who did not present the heterozygous GCK-MODY phenotype. In fact, she exhibited severe hyperglycemia (765 mg/dl), dehydration, glucosuria, and ketoacidosis (pH 7.09, BE 14 mM) on the day after her birth. For the first 72 h after diagnosis, she was treated with 0.1–0.3 units/kg/h intravenous insulin for persistent hyperglycemia: the mean value from that period equaled 340 mg/dl.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, her DNA was directly sequenced using Sanger’s method to identify homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the GCK gene using an ABI 3130 genetic analyser and DNA Sequencing Analysis Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequencer software v4.1.4 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was used for the comparative analysis of evaluated sequences. In addition, the use of Sanger’s sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification technique (MLPA) did not detect mutations or deletions in other known genes associated with monogenic diabetes. Only the heterozygous GCK p.Gly223Ser mutation was detected.\r\n\r\nTo further investigate the cause of such diversions from the expected phenotype, the DNA was reanalysed by next-generation sequencing in the reference laboratory in Exeter, UK. A targeted next-generation sequencing assay performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) [3] indicated the presence of a second missense mutation in the GCK gene, c.1236A>G, which resulted in the amino acid substitution of glutamic acid to lysine at position 256 (p.Glu256Lys). This mutation was not visible in the results of the previous Sanger`s sequencing analysis and is now known to represent part of a compound heterozygous genotype resulting in PNDM (Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus). Reanalysis of the patient’s sample by Sanger’s sequencing revealed a rare single nucleotide polymorphism located in the DNA sequence covered by one primer used for PCR (rs573845006 reported in dbSNP build 142), which was in cis with the p.Glu256Lys mutation. This SNP resulted in allele dropout during PCR and previous misdiagnosis. Finally, a repeated Sanger’s sequencing of the GCK gene with redesigned primers also confirmed the p.Glu256Lys mutation (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1\r\n\r\nGenetic evaluation of the patient with GCK-PNDM originally previously reported [1]. a Family pedigree of the PNDM patient with compound heterozygous mutations in the GCK gene (No. 5109), N wild type, M mutation; b chromatograms obtained by direct sequencing ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe p.Glu256Lys mutation was not inherited from the patient’s mother who is a carrier for the p.Glu223Ser mutation. We were not able to obtain biological material from the father of the patient. Since he did not report any symptoms of glucose metabolism disorders at the age of 38 years (fasting glucose 76 mg/dl; HbA1c 5.1 %; OGGT normal) and no family history of diabetes, and the p.Glu256Lys substitution is known in literature as causal for GCK-MODY phenotype, one may speculate that this mutation occurred as de novo in our PNDM patient. This is unusual finding leading to GCK-PNDM.\r\n\r\nThis case reinforces the need to remain aware of the potential for technology, reagents or other unforeseeable external factors to influence the results. Extreme caution is advised, both in diagnosing and in excluding some disorders, particularly in the case of such an extraordinary phenotype.\r\n\r\nApproaching 10 years from the introduction of next-generation sequencing to widespread use, there is currently no doubt as to its usefulness [4]. Our laboratory is just one example of an institution, which has successfully incorporated NGS techniques into its daily workload, showing that new technologies may significantly improve the efficacy of tests, even those, which are retrospective in nature.",

The aim of this study was to explore associations between clinical and psychosocial factors and HbA1c in insulin pump users to identify and prioritize areas for potential intervention. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey covering clinical and psychosocial aspects of life with type 1 diabetes was distributed to all adult (≥ 18 years) insulin pump users in the Capital Region of Denmark. Responses were combined with data from medical records and national registries. Associations with HbA1c were modeled using regression-based machine learning. Results: Of 1,591 invited individuals, 770 (48.4%) responded to the survey. Mean HbA1c among responders was 7.3% (56 mmol/mmol), and 35.6% had an HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Six factors were significantly associated with HbA1c: diabetes duration (0.006% (0.1 mmol/mol) lower HbA1c per 1-year increase in diabetes duration); education (0.4% (4.3 mmol/mol) lower HbA1c with long higher education vs. primary school); insulin type (0.2% (2.2 mmol/mol) lower HbA1c with ultra-rapid-acting insulin vs. rapid-acting insulin); hypoglycemia awareness status (0.2% (2.2 mmol/mol) lower HbA1c with complete unawareness vs. full awareness); insulin device satisfaction (0.2% (2.7 mmol/mol) lower HbA1c per 1-point increase in Insulin Device Satisfaction Survey score); and diabetes distress (0.3% (3.1 mmol/mol) higher HbA1c per 1-point increase in Type 1 Diabetes Distress Scale score). Conclusions: This study identified several associations between clinical and psychosocial factors and HbA1c that may be considered when developing interventions targeted people with type 1 diabetes.",

A main objective has been to review the controversies that followed the Nobel Prize and to outline the role of the priority rule in Science. Methods We have considered the priority rule defined by Robert Merton in 1957, which takes into account the date of acceptance of the report of a discovery in an accredited scientific journal and/or the granting of a patent, complemented by the criteria set out by Ronald Vale and Anthony Hyman (2016) regarding the transfer of information to the scientific community and its validation by it. The awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in October 1923 has represented a frame of reference. The claims and disputes regarding the prioritization of the contributions of the main researchers in the organotherapy of diabetes have been analyzed through the study of their scientific production and the debate generated in academic institutions. Main results and conclusions (1) According to the criteria of Merton, Vale and Hyman, the priority of the discovery of the antidiabetic hormone corresponds to the investigations developed in Europe by E. Gley (1900), GL Zülzer (1908) and NC Paulescu (1920). (2) The active principle of the pancreatic extracts developed by Zülzer (acomatol), Paulescu (pancreina) and Banting and Best (insulin) was the same. (3) JB Collip succeeded in isolating the active ingredient from the pancreatic extract in January 1922, eliminating impurities to the point of enabling its use in the clinic. (4) In 1972, the Nobel Foundation modified the purpose of the 1923 Physiology or Medicine award to Banting and Macleod by introducing a new wording: \"the credit for having produced the pancreatic hormone in a practical available form\" (instead of “for the discovery of insulin”).",

The T1D group had 11.3 ± 5.1 years of diabetes duration and a suboptimal mean glycated haemoglobin level of 7.2 ± 1.1%. The subjects underwent a graded running treadmill test until exhaustion. Lactate concentration was assessed in arterialized blood at baseline and 3 and 20 min after the test. Cortisol, testosterone, tumour necrosis factor α, myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, zonulin, and vitamin D levels were evaluated in cubital fossa vein blood before and 60 min after the test.T1D patients presented higher baseline zonulin, myoglobin concentration, testosterone/cortisol ratio, and lower maximal oxygen uptake. On adjusting for the baseline values, the groups differed in zonulin, lactate dehydrogenase, and myoglobin levels, testosterone/cortisol ratio, and lactate concentration determined 20 min after exercise (P < 0.05).Maximum-intensity exercise increased muscle and intestinal damage in T1D participants. In patients with lower physical activity, very-high-intensity exercise should be recommended with caution. Observing the anabolic-catabolic index may help individualize effort intensity in T1D individuals.",

The aim of this study was to assess early macular vascular changes in prediabetics before development of over diabetes using OCTA and fundus photography. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 66 prediabetic individuals and 66 normal controls underwent clinical, laboratory, and fundus photography evaluation followed by OCTA macular imaging to examine for the foveal avascular zone, and area of capillary non-perfusion, thickness, disorganization of vessels, and vessel density perfusion percentage of superficial capillary plexus and deep capillary plexus. Results Retinal microangiopathy was detected in 36.4% of prediabetics by OCTA and only in 10.6% by fundus photography. None of clinical or laboratory parameters had significant association with DR. Area of capillary non-perfusion and disorganization of SCP were detected in 53.8% and 56.8%, respectively, in prediabetics. VDP of SCP and DCP of whole image, parafoveal, and perifoveal areas was significantly lower in prediabetes group compared to normal control. VDP of DCP of perifoveal area ( β coefficient: − 0.10, OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86–0.96, P &lt; 0.001) and disorganization of DCP ( β coefficient: 1.93, OR: 6.89, 95% CI: 2.5–18.8, P &lt; 0.001) were significant predictors of DR in prediabetics. There was no difference in FAZ in prediabetics with and without retinopathy. Conclusions OCTA could detect early retinal vascular changes during the prediabetic state before developing diabetes. VDP was significantly reduced in prediabetic patients. Furthermore, VDP of DCP of perifoveal area and disorganization of DCP were the most important predictors of retinopathy in prediabetic patients .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims To determine whether carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD), is associated with long-term blood glucose control in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods We recruited 508 individuals (43.4% men; median age 46.1, IQR 37.8–55.9 years) with T1D (median diabetes duration of 30.4, IQR 21.2–40.8 years) in a cross-sectional retrospective sub-study, part of the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) Study. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ) data were collected retrospectively over the course of ten years (HbA 1c -mean overall ) prior to the clinical study visit that included a clinical examination, biochemical sampling, and ultrasound of the common carotid arteries. Results Individuals with T1D had a median CIMT of 606 μm (IQR 538–683 μm) and HbA 1c of 8.0% (7.3–8.8%) during the study visit and HbA 1c -mean overall of 8.0% (IQR 7.3–8.8%). CIMT did not correlate with HbA 1c ( p = 0.228) at visit or HbA 1c -mean overall ( p = 0.063). After controlling for relevant factors in multivariable linear regression analysis, only age was associated with CIMT ( p &lt; 0.001). After further dividing CIMT into quartiles, no correlation between long-term glucose control and CIMT (%, 1 st 8.1 [IQR 7.2–8.9] vs 4 th 7.9 [7.4–8.7], p = 0.730) was found. Conclusions We observed no correlation between long-term blood glucose control and CIMT in individuals with T1D. This finding suggests that the development of early signs of macrovascular atherosclerosis is not strongly affected by the glycemic control in people with T1D.",

    "abstract": "To analyze physical performance and diabetes-related outcomes in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) during two semi-competitive football matches utilising precise physical activity monitoring. The study was conducted during an annual summer camp for adolescents with T1DM. After physical examination and glycated hemoglobin measurement, 16 adolescent players completed Cooper's 12-min running test and, in the following days, took part in two football matches while wearing heart rate (HR) monitors coupled with global positioning system (GPS) tracking. Both matches were comparable in terms of covered distances, number of sprints, achieved velocities and heart rate responses. During both games, capillary blood lactate increased significantly (Match 1: 1.75 ± 0.16–6.13 ± 1.73 mmol/l; Match 2: 1.77 ± 0.18–3.91 ± 0.63 mmol/l, p = 0.004). No significant differences in blood glucose were observed between the matches (p = 0.83) or over each match (p = 0.78). Clinically significant hypoglycemia (< 54 mg/dl) occurred in two children during the first match. None of the players experienced severe hypoglycemia. Despite similar workloads, players consumed significantly less carbohydrates during Match 2 [median difference: − 20 g (25–75%: − 40 to 0), p = 0.006]. HR monitoring and GPS-based tracking can effectively parameterize physical activity during a football match. In T1DM patients, exercise workload and glycemic changes during similar matches are comparable, which provides an opportunity to develop individual recommendations for players with T1DM.",

As concerns the risks of COVID-induced disease, published data show that pregnant women who develop COVID-19 have fewer symptoms than patients who are not pregnant, but they are more likely to need hospitalization in intensive care, and neonatal morbidity. Aim of the present perspective paper is to analyze the current literature regarding the use of the vaccine against COVID-19 infection, in terms of safety and protection, in high risk pregnant women as those affected by diabetes and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Most risk calculators that predict future cardiovascular disease (CVD) by baseline profiles are originally developed for primary prevention, but some studies applied the calculators to secondary prevention. We compared the impact of baseline profiles on the future CVD risk between patients with diabetes with and without a CVD history. Methods We analyzed a multicenter prospective cohort of 6338 Japanese patients with diabetes aged 40–74 years, including those with ( n = 634) and without a CVD history ( n = 5704). The future risk of CVD was investigated using the competing risk model, with adjustment for non-cardiovascular mortality. Results During the median follow-up of 6.9 years, 413 CVD events were observed. The 8-year cumulative incidence rates of CVD were 21.5% and 7.2% in patients with and without a CVD history, respectively. A higher systolic blood pressure and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were independently associated with a future CVD risk in patients without a CVD history (both P &lt; 0.05), whereas they were not associated in those with a CVD history. The P values for interaction were 0.040 and 0.005, respectively. The male sex, an older age, a longer duration of diabetes, higher hemoglobin A1c levels, and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were common independent risk factors regardless of CVD history (all P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The prognostic impact of metabolic profiles on CVD risk would not be identical between patients with and without a CVD history, suggesting that it might be inappropriate to apply CVD risk calculators developed for primary prevention to patients with a CVD history.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Valid health economic models are essential to inform the adoption and reimbursement of therapies for diabetes mellitus. Often existing health economic models are applied in other countries and settings than those where they were developed. This practice requires assessing the transferability of a model developed from one setting to another. We evaluate the transferability of the MICADO model, developed for the Dutch 2007 setting, in two different settings using a range of adjustment steps. MICADO predicts micro- and macrovascular events at the population level. Methods MICADO simulation results were compared to observed events in an Italian 2000–2015 cohort (Casale Monferrato Survey [CMS]) and in a Dutch 2008–2019 (Hoorn Diabetes Care Center [DCS]) cohort after adjusting the demographic characteristics. Additional adjustments were performed to: (1) risk factors prevalence at baseline, (2) prevalence of complications, and (3) all-cause mortality risks by age and sex. Model validity was assessed by mean average percentage error (MAPE) of cumulative incidences over 10 years of follow-up, where lower values mean better accuracy. Results For mortality, MAPE was lower for CMS compared to DCS (0.38 vs. 0.70 following demographic adjustment) and adjustment step 3 improved it to 0.20 in CMS, whereas step 2 showed best results in DCS (0.65). MAPE for heart failure and stroke in DCS were 0.11 and 0.22, respectively, while for CMS was 0.42 and 0.41. Conclusions The transferability of the MICADO model varied by event and per cohort. Additional adjustments improved prediction of events for MICADO. To ensure a valid model in a new setting it is imperative to assess the impact of adjustments in terms of model accuracy, even when this involves the same country, but a new time period.",

The present investigation was undertaken to study how the acute inflammation developed over time.Immunohistochemical evaluation of the immune response triggered by instillation of heat-inactivated bacteria in the ductal compartment in rats.After three weeks, the triggered inflammation had vanished and pancreases showed normal morphology. However, a distinct accumulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within and adjacent to affected islets was found in one-third of the rats instilled with heat-inactivated E. faecalis, mimicking the insulitis seen at onset of human T1D. As in T1D, this insulitis affected a minority of islets and only certain lobes of the pancreases. Notably, a fraction of the T cells expressed the CD103 antigen, mirroring the recently reported presence of tissue resident memory T cells in the insulitis in humans with recent onset T1D.The results presented unravel a previously unknown interplay between innate and acquired immunity in the formation of immunopathological events indistinguishable from those described in humans with recent onset T1D.",

    "abstract": "Even though most pregnancies are uneventful, occasionally complications do occur. Gestational diabetes is linked to an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Early identification of women at risk of experiencing adverse outcomes, ideally through a single blood test, would facilitate early intervention. Plasma glycated CD59 (pGCD59) is an emerging biomarker which has shown promise in identifying hyperglycaemia during pregnancy and has been associated with the risk of delivering an LGA infant. The aim of this study was to explore the ability of the first- and second-trimester pGCD59 to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes.This was a prospective study of 378 pregnant women. Samples for pGCD59 were taken at the first antenatal visit and at the time of the 2 h 75 g OGTT (24-28 weeks of gestation). Adjusted receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the ability of pGCD59 to predict maternal and neonatal outcomes.First-trimester pGCD59 levels were higher in women with gestational diabetes who delivered a macrosomic infant (4.2 ± 0.7 vs. 3.5 ± 1.0 SPU, p < 0.01) or an LGA infant (4.3 ± 0.3 vs. 3.6 ± 1.0 SPU, p = 0.01) compared to women with GDM that did not experience these outcomes. Second-trimester pGCD59 levels were higher in women that developed polyhydramnios (2.9 ± 0.4 vs. 2.5 ± 1.1 SPU, p = 0.03). First- and second-trimester pGCD59 predicted pregnancy-induced hypertension with good accuracy (AUC:0.85, 95%CI:0.78-0.91; AUC: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.73-0.88, respectively) and neonatal hypoglycaemia with fair to good accuracy (AUC:0.77, 95%CI: 0.54-0.99, AUC:0.81, 95%CI:0.62-0.99).This study has shown that pGCD59 has the potential to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes. Prospective studies with a larger number of cases are necessary to fully explore and validate the potential of this emerging biomarker in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

    "abstract": "To assess the relationship between body surface area (BSA) at birth and future risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This is an observational cohort study from Vantaa, Finland. The cohort included 1548 Finnish primiparous women, aged 15–28 years, without pre-existing diabetes, who gave birth 2009–2015. All women were born full-term and had complete information about their birth weight and length, from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Additional data for the study were provided by individual patient health records and Statistics Finland. Study participants were divided into five levels (I–V) according to BSA at birth, based on normal distribution. There was an inverse association between BSA at birth and risk for GDM (p = 0.015 for linearity, after adjustments for age, educational attainment, pre-pregnancy BMI and smoking). The odds ratio (OR) for GDM in level V, with the largest BSA at birth, compared with level I, with the smallest BSA at birth, was 0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22–0.83]; adjusted for age, educational attainment, pre-pregnancy body mass index and smoking. The OR for GDM was 0.8 (95% CI 0.68–0.95, p = 0.009) for each one standard deviation increase in BSA at birth, adjusted for the same confounders. BSA at birth correlated with adult anthropometry: correlation coefficients were r = 0.16 (95% CI 0.11–0.21) for weight, r = 0.31 (95% CI 0.26–0.35) for height, and r = 0.06 (95% CI 0.01–0.11) for BMI. Body surface area at birth is inversely associated with future risk for GDM in primiparous women.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Circulating levels of TNF alpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) and 2 (TNFR2) are associated with increased long-term mortality and impaired kidney function. Aim To study association between circulating levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 and short-term mortality in patients with diabetes and dyspnea. Population and methods Patients aged ≥ 18 years seeking at emergency department (ED) during daytime on weekdays between December 2013 and July 2018, with diabetes and acute dyspnea, identified at the triage process, were included. Participants ( n = 291) were triaged according to Medical Emergency Triage and Treatment System-Adult score, and blood samples were collected. Association between TNFR1 and TNFR2, respectively, and 90-day mortality were estimated by Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, creatinine and CRP. Results Univariate models showed significant associations between TNFR1 and TNFR2, respectively, and CRP, age and creatinine. TNFR1 and TNFR2 tended to be elevated in patients with the highest triage level, compared to patients with lower triage levels (ns). In longitudinal analyses, TNFR1 but not TNFR2 was associated with increased short-term mortality, HR adjusted for age, BMI and creatinine 1.43 (95% CI 1.07–1.91), but not in the model also adjusted for CRP, HR 1.29 (95% CI 0.94–1.77). In secondary analysis for quartile 4 versus quartiles 1–3 of TNFR1, corresponding HRs were 2.46 (95% CI 1.27–5.15) and 2.21 (95% CI 1.07–2.56). Conclusions We found a trend for the association between circulating TNFR1 levels and short-term mortality in patients with diabetes and acute dyspnea at the ED, possibly suggesting an inflammatory pathway for the association .",

    "abstract": "Prior exposure to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was shown to increase glial acetate metabolism (GAM) during subsequent exposure to hypoglycemia in diabetic individuals. However, it remained unclear whether this effect was dependent on the disease state or the antecedent cause of hypoglycemia. We aimed to establish whether exposure to fasting-induced hypoglycemia was sufficient to produce alterations in GAM in non-diabetic individuals.GAM was measured via carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy during infusion of [1-13C] acetate before and after a 72-h fast in six metabolically healthy men. All participants were male, aged 18-40 years, with a Body Mass Index of 20.0-27.9 kg/m2, who consented to reside at Pennington Biomedical Research Center for 4 days. The main outcome measure was the percent enhancement of cerebral [1-13C] bicarbonate (the primary metabolic byproduct of glial oxidation of [1-13C] acetate). Continuous glucose monitoring was used to measure hypoglycemic episodes during the 72-h fast.As expected, 72 h of fasting significantly reduced blood glucose levels and resulted in a high frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. Steady-state GAM increased from 53.5 ± 3.7 to 61.9 ± 1.7% following the 72-h fast (p = 0.005). This increase correlated with greater duration of hypoglycemia experienced during the fast (r = 0.967). In addition, subjects with greater GAM at baseline experienced a greater increase in the duration of hypoglycemia experienced during the 72-h fast (r = 0.979).GAM has potential as a biomarker for susceptibility to hypoglycemic episodes.Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02690168.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise plays an important role in both the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases. Peptides secreted or released from skeletal muscle, so-called myokines, contribute to the beneficial anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects of increased muscle activity and may, therefore, counteract pathomechanisms of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [1]. However, the impact of myokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-15, angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), fibroblast growth factors (FGF)-2, FGF-21, and irisin on altered organ cross-talk in cardiometabolic diseases is still poorly understood [1]. Irisin has been described as a protein released from skeletal muscle after physical activity [2] which may, in rodents and more controversially discussed in humans [1], mediate browning of white adipose tissue. Although the existence of circulating human irisin has even been questioned because human FNDC5 has a noncanonical ATA translation start, irisin has been detected in human plasma using mass spectrometry with appropriate control peptides [3]. IL-15 increases upon both aerobic and resistance exercise and exerts beneficial metabolic effects in patients with obesity and T2D [1]. IL-15 inhibits lipogenesis, induces fat oxidation, enhances energy expenditure, and improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism [4]. To better understand the potential role of these myokines in T2D, we tested the hypotheses that IL-15 and irisin serum concentrations correlate with cardiometabolic risk parameters and are different in subgroups of T2D patients with or without diabetes complications independently of ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Obesity is known to be associated with an altered thermoregulation as well as a dysregulation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Considering the ability of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) to modulate the SNS, we hypothesized a potential role of dTMS in affecting thermoregulation in obesity. Aims of the study were to monitor the effect of a single session of dTMS on body temperature in subjects with obesity, and to correlate the dTMS-induced changes in body temperature with activation of the SNS (epinephrine and norepinephrine release). Methods Twenty-nine subjects with obesity [5 M, 24 F; age 50 (IQR: 58, 38) yrs; BMI 36.1 (IQR: 33.9, 38.7) kg/m 2 ] were randomized into 2 groups receiving a single session of high frequency stimulation (HF) or sham stimulation. Under neutral thermal conditions, infrared thermography was utilized to assess bilateral fingernail-beds and abdominal temperature. Results During a single session HF, the average temperature of both fingernail-beds decreased. Right-hand temperature difference was statistically greater in HF vs Sham: median = – 1.45 (IQR: – 2.0, – 1.0) °C for HF, p = 0.009. While temperature variation in the fingernail-bed of left hand was not statistically significant in HF compared to Sham: median = – 1.26 (IQR: – 1.6, –0.5) °C, p = 0.064. Concurrently, when estimating the effect of norepinephrine variation on temperature change of fingernail-bed of left hand, a borderline significant positive association was estimated (beta = 1.09, p = 0.067) in HF. Conclusions Deep TMS revealed to be effective in modulating temperature in subjects with obesity, partially reversing obesity-induced alterations in heat production and dissipation with a potential SNS-mediated mechanism.",

    "abstract": "As recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), health practitioners should encourage a healthy nutrition and adequate weight gain during pregnancy in order to ensure favorable pregnancy and fetal outcomes, and to prevent diseases later in life for both mother and child. The purpose of this online survey was to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the 2009 IOM recommendations among healthcare professionals managing nutritional therapy in pregnancies complicated by diabetes in Italy.A cross-sectional survey was conducted by using an online self-administered questionnaire undertaken between October and December 2021.Of the 220 participants 89% were diabetologists/endocrinologists/internal medicine specialists and 11% dietitians/nutritionists. The survey found that the 53% of respondents provide a personalized diet to pregnant women with diabetes, while 32% a standard diet plan and only 15% healthy dietary advice. The 69% of the participants investigated for appropriate gestational weight gain, mainly based on pre-pregnancy BMI (96%), gestational weight gain (GWG) at first prenatal visit (80%) and presence of twin pregnancy (58%). Maternal weight gain was evaluated at each regularly scheduled prenatal visit and compared with IOM recommendations for the 87% of healthcare professionals. Diet plan was periodically re-evaluated and/or modified (90% of participants), based on inadequate maternal weight gain and/or fetal growth abnormalities (78%), trimester transition (53%), changes in physical activity and/or a \"feel hungry\" (50%).This survey reported the knowledge and attitude of IOM guidelines and the nutritional knowledge and practice of Italian professionals on the nutritional management of diabetes in pregnancy. The application of these recommendations seemed more feasible in clinics/team dedicated to \"Diabetes in Pregnancy\".",

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the relationship between pre- and post-diagnostic 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) over a period of 30 years in individuals who developed T2DM compared to healthy controls.This case-control study included 254 participants with blood samples collected at five different time-points (T1-T5) between 1986 and 2016. Of the 254 participants, 116 were diagnosed with T2DM between T3 and T4, and were considered cases; the remaining 138 were controls. Linear mixed regression models were used to examine pre- and post-diagnostic changes in 25(OH)D concentrations, and logistic regression was used to examine associations between these concentrations and T2DM at each time-point.25(OH)D concentrations at different time-points and the longitudinal change in concentrations differed between cases and controls, and by sex. For women, each 5-nmol/l increase in 25(OH)D concentrations was inversely associated with T2DM at T3 (odds-ratio, OR, 0.79), whereas for men, this same increase was positively associated with T2DM at T1 (OR 1.12). Cases experienced a significant decrease in pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D concentrations (p value < 0.01 for women, p value = 0.02 for men) and a significant increase in post-diagnostic 25(OH)D concentrations (p value < 0.01 for women, p value = 0.01 for men). As such, each 1-unit increase in month-specific z-score change between T1 and T3 was significantly inversely associated with T2DM (OR 0.51 for women, OR 0.52 for men), and each such increase between T3 and T5 was significantly positively associated with T2DM in women (OR 2.48).25(OH)D concentrations seem to be affected by disease progression and type 2 diabetes diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims This investigation aimed to determine the effect of different intensities of training on non-exercise physical activity (NEPA) and estimated thermogenesis (NEAT) from a 1-year exercise randomized controlled trial (RCT) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on non-training days. Additionally, changes in NEPA and estimated NEAT in those who failed (low-responders) or succeeded (high-responders) in attaining exercise-derived clinically meaningful reductions in body weight (BW) and fat mass (FM) (i.e., 6% for FM and 3% for BW) was assessed. Methods Individuals with T2DM ( n = 80) were enrolled in a RCT with three groups: resistance training combined with moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and a control group. Of the 80 participants, 56 (completed data) were considered for this secondary analysis. NEPA and estimated NEAT were obtained by accelerometry and body composition through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results After adjustments, no time*group interactions were found for estimated NEAT in the MICT (β = − 5.33, p = 0.366) and HIIT (β = − 5.70, p = 0.283), as well as for NEPA in the MICT (β = − 452.83, p = 0.833) and HIIT (β = − 2770.76, p = 0.201), when compared to controls. No compensatory changes in NEPA and estimated NEAT were observed when considering both low-responders and high-responders to FM and BW when compared to controls. Conclusions Both MICT and HIIT did not result in any compensatory changes in estimated NEAT and NEPA with the intervention on non-training days. Moreover, no changes in estimated NEAT and NEPA were found when categorizing our participants as low-responders and high-responders to FM and BW when compared to controls.

In addition to IT-IPA, questionnaires evaluating depression, anxiety, diabetes distress, self-efficacy, and treatment satisfaction were administered. The six factors identified in the IPA German version were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis; psychometric testing included construct validity and internal consistency.The online survey was compiled by 182 individuals with type 1 diabetes: 45.6% continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) users and 54.4% multiple daily insulin injection users. The six-factor model had a very good fit in our sample. The internal consistency was acceptable (Cronbach's α = 0.75; 95% IC [0.65-0.81]). Diabetes treatment satisfaction was positively correlated with a positive attitude towards CSII therapy (Spearman's rho = 0.31; p < 0.01), less Technology Dependency, higher Ease of Use, and less Impaired Body Image. Furthermore, less Technology Dependency was associated with lower diabetes distress and depressive symptoms.The IT-IPA is a valid and reliable questionnaire evaluating attitudes towards insulin pump therapy. The questionnaire can be used for clinical practice during consultations for shared decision-making to CSII therapy.",

All study participants self-identified by the Hispanic ethnicity. A longitudinal study design was used to compare baseline diabetic health measures with outcome data after patient program participation over a 12-month enrollment period. Linear mixed effect model was used to determine the patient specific change in HbA1C across time, controlling for gender, age, food insecurity, income level, diabetes type, and literacy. In addition, McNemar tests were conducted to compare the coverage of eye exams and statin use before and after program enrollment.After program enrollment, individual specific change in HbA1C was expected to be - 0.201 [95% CI 0.244, - 0.158] % per month after controlling for baseline covariates. There were statistically significant improvements in both eye exam coverage (p < 0.01) and statin use (p < 0.01).The Chronic Care Model can be successfully applied to improve health outcome measures at a free, non-federally funded community clinic among uninsured, undocumented immigrants, who identify by the Hispanic ethnicity and have the diagnosis of diabetes. Barriers to care including food insecurity, federal poverty level and illiteracy do not preclude glycemic control.",

    "abstract": "Deep metagenomics offers an advanced tool for examining the relationship between gut microbiota composition and function and the onset of disease; in this case, does the composition and function of gut microbiota during pregnancy differ in women who develop prediabetes and those who do not at two-year postpartum, and whether the gut microbiota composition associates with glycemic traits.In total, 439 women were recruited in early pregnancy. Gut microbiota was assessed by metagenomics analysis in early (13.9 ± 2.0 gestational weeks) and late pregnancy (35.1 ± 1.0 gestational weeks). Prediabetes was determined using American Diabetes Association criteria as fasting plasma glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/l analyzed by an enzymatic hexokinase method. Of the women, 39 (22.1%) developed prediabetes by two-year postpartum.The relative abundances of Escherichia unclassified (FDR < 0.05), Clostridiales bacterium 1_7_ 47FAA (FDR < 0.25) and Parabacteroides (FDR < 0.25) were higher, and those of Ruminococcaceae bacterium D16 (FDR < 0.25), Anaerotruncus unclassified (FDR < 0.25) and Ruminococcaceae noname (FDR < 0.25) were lower in early pregnancy in those women who later developed prediabetes. In late pregnancy, Porphyromonas was higher and Ruminococcus sp 5_1_39BFAA was lower in prediabetes (FDR < 0.25). Furthermore, fasting glucose concentrations associated inversely with Anaerotruncus unclassified in early pregnancy and directly with Ruminococcus sp 5_1_39BFAA in late pregnancy (FDR < 0.25). α-Diversity or β-diversity did not differ significantly between the groups. Predictions of community function during pregnancy were not associated with prediabetes.Our study shows that some bacterial species during pregnancy contributed to the onset of prediabetes within two-year postpartum. These were attributable primarily to a lower abundance of short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Aims: To evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening incidence in a universal healthcare system. Methods: Registry-based cohort study based on a Danish regional population from 2009 to 2018. Individuals with diabetes were identified by medication. Screening attendance was estimated by surrogate measures using local and nationwide databases reported by cumulative incidence. Results: 18,832 patients were included. By the end of the first year, the cumulative incidence of screening for DR was 60.2% and by the end of the second year 74.2%. The cumulative incidence was 93.9% overall, 97.7% for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 93.4% for patients with type 2 diabetes. Screening proportions per 1, 2 and 5 years were calculated. Females, patients with T1D, and patients attending screening at hospitals had a higher Hazard Ratio of 1.084, 1.157, and 1.573, respectively. The Cochran-Armitage trend test indicated increased screening frequency from 2009 to 2018. Validation of DR screening was done at hospitals with a mean positive predictive value of 86.78%. Cumulative incidence curves showed a small right shift when censoring the first, second and third screening visits. Conclusions: Nearly all patients were screened for DR over a 5-year timespan. Female patients with T1D who attended screening at hospitals were significantly more likely to be screened. Validation of screening visits at hospitals was reported with a high mean positive predictive value. Most other studies, to the best of our knowledge, only report screening attendance for patients already enrolled in a DR screening programme. This study describes the overall screening attendance for the total eligible diabetes population.",

    "abstract": "Intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) systems have not been thoroughly evaluated during in-hospital stay, and there are concerns about accuracy during various conditions. Patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy have an increased risk of hyperglycaemia after surgery which is aggravated by parenteral nutrition therapy. This study aims to evaluate glycaemic control and safety during insulin infusion in a surgical non-ICU ward, using a hybrid glucose monitoring approach with isCMG and periodic point-of-care (POC) testing.We prospectively included 100 patients with a resectable pancreatic tumour. After surgery, continuous insulin infusion was initiated when POC glucose was > 7 mmol/l and titrated to maintain glucose between 7 and 10 mmol/l. Glucose was monitored with isCGM together with intermittent POC, every 3-6 h. Median absolute relative difference (MARD) and hypoglycaemic events were evaluated. Mean glucose was compared with a historic control (n = 100) treated with multiple subcutaneously insulin injections, monitored with POC only.The intervention group (isCGM/POC) had significantly lower POC glucose compared with the historic control group (8.8 ± 2.2 vs. 10.4 ± 3.4 mmol/l, p < 0.001). MARD was 17.8% (IQR 10.2-26.7). isCGM readings were higher than POC measurements in 91% of the paired cases, and isCGM did not miss any hypoglycaemic event. About 4.5% of all isCGM readings were < 3.9 mmol/l, but only six events were confirmed with POC, and none was < 3.0 mmol/l.A hybrid approach with isCGM/POC is a safe and effective treatment option in a non-ICU setting after pancreatoduodenectomy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims The Italian Titration Approach Study (ITAS) demonstrated comparable HbA 1c reductions and similarly low hypoglycaemia risk at 6 months in poorly controlled, insulin-naïve adults with T2DM who initiated self- or physician-titrated insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300) in the absence of sulphonylurea/glinide. The association of patient characteristics with glycaemic and hypoglycaemic outcomes was assessed. Methods This post hoc analysis investigated whether baseline patient characteristics and previous antihyperglycaemic drugs were associated with HbA 1c change and hypoglycaemia risk in patient- versus physician-managed Gla-300 titration. Results HbA 1c change, incidence of hypoglycaemia (any type) and nocturnal rates were comparable between patient- and physician-managed arms in all subgroups. Hypoglycaemia rates across subgroups (0.03 to 3.52 events per patient-year) were generally as low as observed in the full ITAS population. Small increases in rates of 00:00–pre-breakfast and anytime hypoglycaemia were observed in the ≤ 10-year diabetes duration subgroup in the patient- versus physician-managed arm (heterogeneity of effect; p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Comparably fair glycaemic control and similarly low hypoglycaemia risk were achieved in almost all patient subgroups with patient- versus physician-led Gla-300 titration. These results reinforce efficacy and safety of Gla-300 self-titration across a range of phenotypes of insulin-naïve people with T2DM. Clinical trial registration EudraCT 2015-001167-39",

Investigate whether allelic variations of the glucocorticoid receptor are related to an increased risk of HiP. Method The following polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) were investigated in the cohort study of N = 197 pregnant women with HiP and N = 133 normoglycemic pregnant controls: 646C &gt; G (rs41423247), N363S (rs6195), ER23/22EK (rs6190, rs6189). Results A GG variant of the rs41423247 polymorphism was associated with a significantly higher risk for HiP: OR 1.94 (1.18; 3.18), p = 0.009. The relationship remained significant after controlling for maternal age and prepregnancy BMI: OR 3.09 (1.25; 7.64), p = 0.014. Conclusions The allelic GG variant of the 646C &gt; G (rs41423247) polymorphism is associated with an increased risk for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a prevalent complication in pregnancy that requires effective self-management, which can be influenced by illness perceptions. Moreover, behavioral regulation can be affected by attachment styles. Thus, our study aimed to identify common GDM perception profiles and test their association with attachment styles. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 446 women completed the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ), the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), and additional items about GDM diagnosis, information, competence, adherence, behavioral change. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted to determine GDM perception profiles. Multinomial logistic regression followed to calculate the association between GDM perception profiles and attachment styles. Results Three distinct profiles emerged: coping (n = 172, 38.6%)—characterized by the most positive GDM perception, burdened (n = 222, 49.8%)—indicating the emotional burden of the disease, and resourceless (n = 52, 11.7%)—reporting lack of resources (i.e. information, competence). Women with insecure attachment styles were more likely to develop a burdened GDM perception profile. Specifically, the expression of a fearful (OR = 1.184 [95%CI: 1.03; 1.36], p = 0.016) and a preoccupied (OR = 1.154 [95%CI: 1.01; 1.32], p = 0.037) attachment style increased the likelihood for a burdened perception profile, while a secure attachment style (OR = 10.791 [95%CI: 0.65; 0.96], p = 0.017) decreased likelihood for developing resourceless GDM perception profile. Conclusions Three GDM perception profiles were identified and the role of attachment styles in shaping these perceptions was confirmed. Further studies are needed to investigate whether a tailored treatment approach based on the predominant attachment style could lead to more positive GDM perceptions, improved glycemic control, and better perinatal outcomes.",

Methods Androgen concentrations were analysed in serum samples from 116 T2DM cases and 138 controls at 3, pre-diagnostic time-points: 1986/87 (T1), 1994/95 (T2), and 2001 (T3). Generalised estimating equations were used to longitudinally examine androgen concentrations, and logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of T2DM at each time-point. Logistic regression models were also used to calculate area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AROC) from models including established risk factors alone (ERF model) and established risk factors plus each androgen, respectively, which were compared to identify improvements in predictive ability. Results For women, no significant associations were observed between any of the investigated androgens and T2DM after adjusting for confounders. For men, after adjusting for confounders, concentrations of all investigated 11-oxygenated androgens were higher in cases than controls at one or several time-points. We observed associations between T2DM and concentrations of 11-ketoandrostenedione (OR: 1.59) and 11-ketotestosterone (OR: 1.62) at T1; and 11-hydroxyandrostenedione (OR: 2.00), 11-hydroxytestosterone (OR: 1.76), 11-ketoandrostenedione (OR: 1.84), 11-ketotestosterone (OR: 1.78) and testosterone (OR: 0.45) at T3 in men. The addition of these androgens (including 11-hydroxytestosterone at T2) to the ERF model resulted in an improved ability to predict T2DM in men (AROC: 0.79–0.82). We did not observe significant differences in changes in androgen concentrations over time between cases and controls in either sex. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that testosterone and 11-oxygenated androgens are associated with T2DM in men before diagnosis and may be potential biomarkers in T2DM risk assessment.",

We administered the questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Diabetes Distress Scale, Diabetes-related Quality of Life, Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. We collected clinical and biochemical data and 14 days glucose metrics in patients with sensor use &gt; 70% in a time span of ± 4 months from the questionnaires’ administration. We excluded 119 patients from our analyses with missing data (final cohort n = 434: 79% of those enrolled). Results Anxiety and depression prevalence was respectively 30.4% and 10.8%. According to the multivariate analysis, higher diabete-related emotional burden, lower treatment satisfaction, but not physician-related distress, were risk factors for anxiety and depression; female sex was associated with anxiety (OR 0.51, 95% 0.31–0.81; p = 0.005); in women, depression was associated with increasing age (males vs. females OR 0.96 per 1 year increase, 95% CI 0.92–1.00; p = 0.036), whilst in men with HbA1c (OR 1.08 per 1 mmol/mol increase, 95% CI 1.03–1.13; p = 0.002). Conclusion Nearly 1/3 of patients with autoimmune diabetes suffers from anxiety and 1/10 from depression. These conditions are associated with independent modifiable and non-modifiable characteristics. For depression, these characteristics differ between males and females.",

Aim To investigate the effect of a combination modality of long-acting insulin for basal coverage and a pump for boluses, on the incidence of DKA and glycemic parameters in pediatric and young adults with poorly controlled T1D. Methods This multicenter, observational retrospective study included 55 patients (age range 3–25 years, 52.7% males) who were treated with the combination modality for a median of 18 months [(IQR)12,47], as part of their clinical care. Data were retrieved at initiation of the combined modality, after 6 months, and at last visit. Results Cohort’s median age at combination modality initiation was 14.5 years [IQR12.4,17.3], and its median HbA1c level was 9.2% [IQR 8.2,10.2]. The main reasons for combination modality initiation were: (a) concern about sustained hyperglycemia on current management in 41.8%, (b) previous DKA episodes in 30.8%, and (c) refusal to wear a pump continuously in 14.6%. The percent of patients experiencing DKA who used the modality till end decreased from 25.4 to 8.8%. The frequency of DKA events per patient month decreased after 6 months from 0.073 (min 0, max 0.5) to 0.020 (min 0, max 0.5), p = 0.01, and at end to 0.016 (min 0, max 0.25), p = 0.007. Conclusions The combination modality of once-daily long-acting insulin and pump for boluses is safe, feasible, and effective in preventing DKA among poorly controlled young people living with T1D, unable or un-willing to use advanced closed pumps.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Diabetic cardiomyopathy in young patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) usually presents as asymptomatic diastolic heart dysfunction with left ventricle (LV) remodeling. Its prevalence seems to be underestimated. One of the factors seemingly influencing LV remodeling is a metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which was extensively investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes but not with T1D. This study aimed to describe the correlation between MASLD risk and relative wall thickness (RWT) in young patients with T1D without heart failure symptoms or treatment. Materials and methods Study participants were recruited at the inpatient diabetology department, in admission order. Patients underwent a set of laboratory tests and echocardiographic examinations. The risk of MASLD was estimated using fatty liver index (FLI). Acquired data was then statistically analyzed. Results The study group consisted of 55 patients. 25 participants had RWT &gt; 0.42, suggesting LV remodeling. Study participants did not differ in HbA1c, NT-proBNP, HDL, LDL, non-HDL, and uric acid concentrations. However, patients with RWT &gt; 0.42 had higher FLI (40.97 vs. 13.82, p &lt; 0.01) and BMI (27.3 vs. 22.5, p &lt; 0.01) and differed in transaminase concentrations. Moreover, patients with RWT &gt; 0.42 had significantly higher LV mass index (85.6 vs. 68.2 g/m2) and altered mitral ring velocities. In univariable logistic regression, FLI correlated with LV remodeling risk (OR 1.028, p = 0.05). The optimal cutoff point for FLI predicting the RWT &gt; 0.42 was 26.38 (OR 10.6, p = 0.04, sensitivity 0.857, specificity 0.657). Conclusions FLI correlates with RWT in patients with T1D independently of diabetes metabolic control and hypothetically may support recognizing T1D patients with a higher risk of LV remodeling.",

Thus, this prospective cohort study aimed to explore the association of SUA with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among patients with DKD in a large, nationally representative sample. Methods This cohort study included data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2018 and the National Death Index mortality data until 31 December 2019. The restricted cubic spline and the Cox proportional hazards regression were conducted to describe the association of SUA with all-cause and CVD mortality and evaluate potential nonlinear associations. Results The analysis included 3470 patients with DKD from NHANES 1999–2018. During the follow-up time of 24,633 person-years, we recorded 1489 all-cause deaths, including 542 CVD deaths. We identified a J-shaped association of SUA with all-cause and CVD mortality. The corresponding inflection points were observed at 5.1 and 5.7 mg/dL. When SUA were higher than inflection points, each 1 mg/dL increase in SUA was linked to a 13% and 22% higher risk of all-cause ( HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.07–1.20; P &lt; 0.001 ) and CVD ( HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.06–1.41; P = 0.006 ) mortality, respectively. Conclusions This study indicated the J-shaped association of SUA with all-cause and CVD mortality in patients with DKD. The corresponding inflection points were 5.1 mg/dL for all causes and 5.7 mg/dL for CVD, respectively. More clinical randomized trials are needed to confirm the optimal uric acid-lowering target.",

This study evaluated longer-term outcomes, providing more generalisable evidence. Methods We identified a cohort of UKBiobank participants with diabetes and retrieved their diagnostic codes for a variety of microvascular diseases, complications of diabetes and systemic comorbidities. We investigated relationships between diagnoses and the study outcome: admission to Critical Care or death from COVID-19, taking age, sex and diabetes duration into account. We tested relationships, adding baseline covariates and weighting diagnostic codes according to their recency prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Results In univariate analyses, DR (OR: 1·519, p = 0·016) and microvascular disease (OR: 2·001, p = 0·000) were associated with greater risk of the outcome. In multivariate analyses, as expected, respiratory disease was most strongly associated with the study outcome, microvascular disease second. Adjusting analyses by number of admissions (general health proxy) and weighted diagnostic coding (comorbidity severity at COVID-19 diagnosis indicator), did not improve predictive power of the model. Conclusions The presence of microvascular disease in routinely-collected healthcare data predicts risk of COVID-19 severe outcomes, independently of general health, in a cohort of people with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Diabetic encephalopathy (DE) is one of the most serious complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), and its pathogenesis has not yet been clarified. Th22 cells are a newly discovered class of CD4 + T cells that play important roles in inflammatory, autoimmune and infectious diseases. However, it is unclear whether Th22 cells are involved in the pathogenesis of DE. Methods We established a T2DM mouse model in vivo and cocultured Th22 cells with microglia under high glucose (HG) conditions in vitro. Cognitive dysfunction was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM ) test; blood‒brain barrier (BBB) integrity was evaluated using the Evans blue (EB) extravasation assay; Th22 cells and IL-22 receptors were detected by immunofluorescence; and IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS, CD86, Arg-1, and CD206 protein expression was measured by Western Blot (WB) analysis. Results Th22 cells passed through the BBB into the hippocampus and secreted interleukin-22 (IL-22), and the mice subsequently exhibited decreased learning and memory abilities. In the DE model, IL-22 promoted the transformation of homeostatic microglia into reactive microglia as well as the inflammatory response. Additionally, coculture of Th22 cells with BV2 microglia cultured under HG conditions increased the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and the microglia showed reactive changes. Mechanistically, IL-22Rα1 acted as a ligand, and IL-22 bound to IL-22Rα1 on microglia to drive primary microglia-induced inflammatory responses. Interestingly, interleukin-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) directly binds to IL-22Rα1 on microglia to inhibit the proinflammatory effects of IL-22. Conclusion Th22 cells secrete IL-22 after passing through the BBB into the hippocampus and promote the transformation of homeostatic microglia into reactive microglia, which induces an inflammatory response, exacerbates learning and memory impairment and cognitive deficits, and contributes to and accelerates the development of DE.",

    "abstract": "The minimal-invasive transplantation of pancreatic islets is a promising approach to treat diabetes mellitus type 1. However, islet transplantation is still hampered by the insufficient process of graft revascularization, leading to a poor clinical outcome. Accordingly, the identification of novel compounds, which accelerate and improve the revascularization of transplanted islets, is of great clinical interest. Previous studies have shown that darbepoetin (DPO)-α, a long lasting analogue of erythropoietin, is capable of promoting angiogenesis. Hence, we investigated in this study whether DPO improves the revascularization of transplanted islets. Islets were isolated from green fluorescent protein-positive FVB/N donor mice and transplanted into dorsal skinfold chambers of FVB/N wild-type animals, which were treated with DPO low dose (2.5 µg/kg), DPO high dose (10 µg/kg) or vehicle (control). The revascularization was assessed by repetitive intravital fluorescence microscopy over an observation period of 14 days. Subsequently, the cellular composition of the grafts was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The present study shows that neither low- nor high-dose DPO treatment accelerates the revascularization of free pancreatic islet grafts. However, high-dose DPO treatment increased the blood volume flow of the transplanted islet. These findings demonstrated that DPO treatment does not affect the revascularization of transplanted islets. However, the glycoprotein increases the blood volume flow of the grafts, which results in an improved microvascular function and may facilitate successful transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim In 2022, in Italy, general practitioners (GPs) have been allowed to prescribe SGLT2i in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) under National Health Service (NHS) reimbursement. In the pivotal clinical trial named DECLARE-TIMI 58, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure, CV death and kidney disease progression compared to placebo in a population of T2D patients. This study evaluated the health and economic impact of dapagliflozin for T2D patients who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the Italian GPs setting. Methods A budget impact model was developed to assess the health and economic impact of introducing dapagliflozin in GPs setting. The analysis was conducted by adopting the Italian NHS perspective and a 3-year time horizon. The model estimated and compared the health outcomes and direct medical costs associated with a scenario with dapagliflozin and other antidiabetic therapies available for GPs prescription (scenario B) and a scenario where only other antidiabetic therapies are available (scenario A). Rates of occurrence of cardiovascular and renal complications as well as adverse events were captured from DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial and the literature, while cost data were retrieved from the Italian tariff and the literature. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the impact of model parameters on the budget impact. Results The model estimated around 442.000 patients eligible for the treatment with dapagliflozin in the GPs setting for each simulated year. The scenario B compared to scenario A was associated with a reduction in the occurrence of cardiovascular and renal complication (−1.83%) over the 3 years simulated. Furthermore, the scenario A allowed for an overall cost saving of 102,692,305€: 14,521,464€ in the first year, 33,007,064€ in the second and 55,163,777€ in the third. The cost of cost of drug acquisition, the probability of cardiovascular events and the percentage of patients potentially eligible to the treatment were the factor with largest impact on the results. Conclusions The use of dapagliflozin in GPs setting reduce the number of CVD events, kidney disease progression and healthcare costs in Italy. These data should be considered to optimize the value produced for the T2D patients who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Although the MODY12 subtype, caused by ABCC8 mutations, is rare, it is highly sensitive to sulfonylureas. The identification of ABCC8 mutations in patients clinically diagnosed with MODY has the ability to contribute to the precise management of diabetes. Methods Genetic analysis of two families with MODY were conducted using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing. The spatial structures of the mutant proteins were constructed using MODELLER and PyMOL software to provide further evidence of pathogenicity. Results The heterozygous missense mutations V357I and R1393H in ABCC8 were found in probands of two unrelated MODY pedigrees, which co-segregated with the hyperglycemic phenotypes in these two pedigrees. Detection of the V357I mutation enabled the proband of family A to successfully transfer from insulin to sulfonylurea (SU). After 3 months of follow-up for the SU trial, the HbA1c level of proband A improved from 12.4% at the initial diagnosis to 7.20%. Proband B was treated with insulin because of pregnancy and poor islet function. In silico analysis indicated that the R1393H mutation resulted in a longer hydrogen bond distance to L1389 and cleavage of carbon-hydrogen bonds to V1395, A1390, and L1389. Conclusions We have described two pathogenic missense mutations in ABCC8 in Chinese families with MODY. Our findings support the heterogeneity in the clinical features of MODY12 caused by ABCC8 mutations.",

    "abstract": "Biotin is known to influence hepatic glucokinase (GK) expression both at a transcriptional and at a translational level. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the effect of biotin on pancreatic GK. For this purpose, RIN 1046-38 cells were cultured in the presence of different biotin concentrations for different times; there-after, GK mRNA expression, GK activity and insulin release were studied. Results demonstrated that biotin has a biphasic effect on GK mRNA expression, being stimulatory after short-term treatment and inhibitory after long-term treatment. GK activity was increased after long-term treatment. Insulin release was not affected by biotin treatment. These data suggest that biotin may influence glucose metabolism also by acting directly at the level of beta-cells.",

Serum samples were tested using the 3-Screen ICA™ ELISA (3-Screen) designed for combined measurement of GADAb and/or IA-2Ab and/or ZnT8Ab. 3-Screen positive samples were then tested for individual diabetes-associated and other organ-specific autoantibodies. Clinical characteristics of patients positive and negative in 3-Screen were analysed.Forty-four (3.5%) of the T2DM patients were positive in 3-Screen, and 38 (86%) of these were also positive for at least one of GADAb, IA-2Ab and ZnT8Ab in assays for the individual autoantibodies. 3-Screen positive patients had lower BMI, higher HbA1c, lower fasting insulin levels and lower fasting C-peptide levels compared to 3-Screen negative patients. Analysis using a homeostatic model assessment (HOMA2) indicated that HOMA2-β-cell function was significantly lower for the forty-four 3-Screen positive patients compared to 3-Screen negative patients. Twenty (45%) 3-Screen positive patients were also positive for at least one thyroid autoantibody.The 3-Screen ELISA has been used successfully for the first time in China to detect diabetes autoantibodies in patients with phenotypic T2DM. 3-Screen positive patients presented with poorer β cell function.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD) is prevalent in type 1 diabetes and has been associated with the haptoglobin variant allele Hp1. Contrarily, the Hp2-allele has been linked to cardiovascular disease and the role of haptoglobin-genotype in asymptomatic SVD is unknown. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the alleles' association with SVD.This cross-sectional study included 179 neurologically asymptomatic adults with type 1 diabetes (women 53%, mean age 39 ± 7 years, diabetes duration 23 ± 10 years, HbA1c 8.1 ± 3.2% [65 ± 12 mmol/mol]). Examinations included genotyping (genotypes Hp1-1, Hp2-1, Hp2-2) by polymerase chain reaction, clinical investigation, and magnetic resonance brain images assessed for SVD manifestations (white matter hyperintensities, cerebral microbleeds, and lacunar infarcts).SVD prevalence was 34.6%. Haptoglobin genotype frequencies were 15.6% (Hp1-1), 43.6% (Hp1-2), and 40.8% (Hp2-2). Only diastolic blood pressure differed between the genotypes Hp1-1, Hp1-2, and Hp2-2 (81 [74-83], 75 [70-80], and 75 [72-81] mmHg, p = 0.019). Haptoglobin genotype frequencies by presence versus absence of SVD were 16.1%; 46.8%; 37.1% versus 15.4%; 41.9%; 42.7% (p = 0.758). Minor allele frequencies were 39.5% versus 36.3% (p = 0.553). Hp1 homozygotes and Hp2 carriers displayed equal proportions of SVD (35.7% vs 34.4%, p > 0.999) and SVD manifestations (white matter hyperintensities 14.3% vs 17.9%, p = 0.790; microbleeds 25.0% vs 21.9%, p = 0.904; lacunar infarcts 0% vs 3.6%, p > 0.999). Hp1-1 was not associated with SVD (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.46-2.94, p = 0.712) when adjusting for age, blood pressure, and diabetic retinopathy.Although the SVD prevalence was high, we detected no significant association between SVD and haptoglobin-genotype.",

    "abstract": "The national guideline for diabetes type 2 claims to involve patients in their decision-making on therapy. Unfortunately, no structured, pharmaceutical-neutral curriculum is available to guide patients in this shared decision-making (SDM) process regarding the insulin injector. The aim of the study was to evaluate which injector patients chose after SDM process and the reasons for their choice.We developed a curriculum for a SDM process to choose an insulin injector for insulin-naive patients with diabetes mellitus, which took place immediately before the start of the initial treatment with insulin. It was conducted by a physician or diabetes educator with no conflicts of interest. All available human short-acting disposable insulin injectors (A, B and C) were handed out for try-out accompanied by individual counselling. The patients selected their injector of choice and were asked immediately afterwards about the criteria for their selection.349 consecutive patients (94% diabetes type 2; age 58.6 + 13.4y; HbA1c 10.4 + 2.1%) were included. Patients choose Injector A in 10.0%, B in 61.9% and C in 28.1%. Criteria for selection were: design (41.8%), general impression (23.5%), dose window (7.7%), dose selection dial (7.4%), most practical (6.6%) and other (13%). Selection of a specific injector was not associated with age, diabetes type, diabetes duration, BMI, HbA1c, presence of concomitant diseases, retinopathy, neuropathy, diabetic foot or physician/diabetes educator.Insulin-naive patients with diabetes mellitus chose their own insulin injector within a newly developed structured SDM process to meet the national guideline. Main selection criteria were design and practicability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Despite recent findings that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a possible risk factor for type 2 diabetes (DM2) and that a strong association exists between gestational diabetes (GDM) and the risk for the development of DM2, no previous studies have investigated the effects of TBI on the risk for the development of GDM. Therefore, this study aims to determine the possible association between a previous traumatic brain injury and later gestational diabetes. Methods In this retrospective register-based cohort study, data from the National Medical Birth Register were combined with data from the Care Register for Health Care. Women who had sustained a TBI before pregnancy were included in the patient group. Women who had sustained previous fractures of the upper extremity, pelvis, or lower extremity were included in the control group. A logistic regression model was used to assess the risk for the development of GDM during pregnancy. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals between the groups were compared. The model was adjusted by prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and maternal age during pregnancy, the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF), maternal smoking status, and multiple pregnancies. The risk for the development of GDM during different periods following the injury (0–3 years, 3–6 years, 6–9 years, and 9+ years) was calculated. Results In total, a 75 g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed on 6802 pregnancies of women who had sustained a TBI and on 11 717 pregnancies of women who sustained fractures of the upper extremity, pelvis, or lower extremity. Of these, 1889 (27.8%) pregnancies were diagnosed with GDM in the patient group and 3117 (26.6%) in the control group. The total odds for GDM were higher after TBI compared to the other traumas (aOR 1.14, CI 1.06–1.22). The odds were highest at 9 + years after the injury (aOR 1.22, CI 1.07–1.39). Conclusion The total odds for the development of GDM after TBI were higher when compared to the control group. Based on our findings, more research on this topic is warranted. Moreover, a history of TBI should be considered a possible risk factor for the development of GDM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Since the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1923 to FG Banting and JJR Macleod, many voices have been raised against this decision. The bitterest protest was that of the Romanian scientist Nicolae C. Paulescu. In 2002, The Romanian Academy of Sciences, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) planned to hold a series of academic events the following year in Paris to acknowledge Paulescu's scientific merits in the discovery of the antidiabetic hormone. However, the initiative was cancelled in August 2003, when the European Center of the Simon Wiesenthal Foundation (SWC) accused Paulescu of being antisemitic. The authors of this manuscript have decided to approach \"the Paulescu case\" from its double aspect, scientific and sociopolitical, to analyze the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the antidiabetic hormone, and Paulescu's alleged antisemitic past in the historical context of the Romanian nation in the interwar period. Methods We contacted the SWC and people related to the 2003 events in Paris. We performed a comparative review of the documents published by the Toronto group and by Paulescu and analyzed the correspondence and articles generated by international experts from the scientific community interested in the controversy. We carried out an exhaustive bibliographic search through several online catalogs (INDEXCAT, NLM Gateway, EUREKA, MEDHIST). We travelled to Bucharest, where we visited Paulescu's house-museum, interviewed a former student of the Romanian professor, and a prominent medical historian who was knowledgeable about Paulescu's scientific and political biography. Dan Angelescu†, son of Dr. Constantin Angelescu (1904–1990), Paulescu's nephew and collaborator, provided us with a copy of all the available documentation from Paulescu's personal archive. It constitutes an essential source for understanding Paulescu's personal, political and academic biography. Archives consulted: Românǎ Academy (Bucharest).

Articles are referenced in the bibliography section at the end of the manuscript. Results A-Nicolae Paulescu developed an intense long-term research activity, which included complete pancreatectomy and preparation of a pancreatic extract (PE) containing the antidiabetic hormone he called pancreina. Parenteral administration of the PE achieved excellent results in the treatment of experimental diabetes in dogs and induction of hypoglycemia in the healthy animal. This work was initiated before 1916 and published at least eight months antedating the publication of the first article by Banting and Best (February 1922), who were acquainted with Paulescu's results, but misinterpreted them. The pancreatic extract of the two Canadian researchers, -iletin/insulin-, only achieved similar results to that of the Romanian scientist once they abandoned the use of the \"degenerated pancreas\" extract (ligation of the ductal system), replacing it with the pancreas of adult or fetal bovine. Pancreina and insulin were very similar. The award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to FG Banting and JJR Macleod in October 1923 honored the successful clinical use of insulin in patients with diabetes mellitus. Paulescu's achievements were ignored. B-Nicolae Paulescu publicly manifested his Judeophobic ideology on multiple occasions in academic and political interventions and in publications and participated with other figures from the Romanian intellectual sphere in the founding of the Uniunea Național Crestinǎ (UNC, National Christian Union) in 1922 and of the Liga Apǎrǎrii Național Cresține (LANC, League for Christian National Defense) in 1923, antisemitic far-right political parties, associated with an irrational Christian orthodoxy and hatred of Jews. Paulescu played a pivotal role in the spread of antisemitism. Conclusions A-The Romanian scientist NC Paulescu started an intense research program aimed at the isolation of the antidiabetic hormone before 1916, including an original procedure of pancreatectomy in the dog and the elaboration of a pancreatic extract that achieved excellent results in the treatment of experimental diabetes, demonstrating its beneficial effects on the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats and reducing both glycosuria and glycemia and the urinary excretion of ketone bodies of depancreatized dogs toward normality. The results of these investigations were published in 1920 and 1921, predating the first report published by FG ​​Banting and CH Best in February 1922. It has been sufficiently demonstrated that Canadian researchers were aware of Paulescu's excellent results, mentioning them only in passing, albeit erroneously misrepresenting key results of the Romanian scientist's publication in the aforementioned seminal Canadian article. Expert historians and international scientists have recognized that the pancreatic extract that Paulescu called pancreina and that obtained by Banting and Best, insulin, were very similar. The October 1923 award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to FG Banting and JJR Macleod ignored Paulescu's scientific achievements in the treatment of experimental diabetes and rewarded the extraordinary advance of insulin treatment in human diabetes. B-At the end of August 2003, a few days before the date of the celebration at the Hôtel Dieu in Paris of the scheduled program of tribute to the scientific merits of NC Paulescu and his important contribution to the discovery of the antidiabetic hormone, convened by the Romanian Academy and the International Diabetes Federation, the Wiesenthal Foundation publicly accused the Romanian scientist of being an antisemite, an act that determined the cancellation of the announced events. The exhaustive investigation of the personal convictions and antisemitic behavior of Nicolae C. Paulescu has undoubtedly documented the Judeophobic ideology of the Romanian scientist, linked to his orthodox religious radicalism, manifested in multiple documents (mostly pamphlets) and interventions in collaboration with other relevant personalities of the Romanian intelligentsia of his time. Furthermore, Paulescu participated in the creation of political organizations of the most radical extreme right that played a fundamental role in the spread of antisemitism amongst the Romanian population and the university community.",

Phase I represents the exploratory phase, consisting of semi-structured interviews with persons with Type 1 diabetes ( N = 16) and partners ( N = 6). In the second phase, co-design principles guided workshops with healthcare professionals, persons with Type 1 diabetes, and partners ( N = 7) to facilitate discussion of the key themes identified and solutions to engage couples living with Type 1 diabetes in diabetes care. Result The key themes identified from phase I as priorities to target in future interventions were: (i) Emotional impact of diabetes and (ii) Partners’ involvement. Priority (i) captures the impact the emotional burden of diabetes management produces within couples’ relationship. Priority (ii) captures the request from partners to be more involved in diabetes management. Characteristics of the interventions suggested during the co-design phase II focused on engaging patients and partners via a counseling point in healthcare settings and tailored help for couples’ psychological support needs. Conclusions Couples value pro-active intervention and support from their diabetes team or primary care for both the partners to live well with Type 1 diabetes.",
