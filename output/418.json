    "abstract": "Mushrooms are a nutritionally, economically, and biotechnologically valuable group of organisms. They are packed with nutritional value in the form of low calories, high protein, and fiber contents. Besides being an important source of food, mushrooms are exploited by man in various ways. Mushrooms can be used in the pharmaceutical industry as antioxidant, anticancer, and immunomodulating agents. They are, at the same time beneficial for human beings and forests as nutrient recyclers in the form of natural decomposers. Mushrooms are also the best source to attain sustainable development goals set by the UNO. Food insecurity, malnutrition and pollution are some of the major issues faced by the modern world in the recent era. Mushrooms in the form of mushroom farming are a promising way to overcome these challenges. Mushroom farming is an efficient way for agro-industrial waste disposal and ensures food security. It is also the cheapest source to make up for the deficiency caused by malnutrition. It supports the local economy by providing more opportunities for livelihood and income by local and national trade. The present review emphasizes the comprehensive account of the different aspects of mushrooms exploitation by which it can save the planet earth and people living on it.",

This term has been used to illustrate the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants, which has been a subject of extensive research. The obtained findings suggest that many diseases are linked to OS, including diabetes mellitusinflammation, cancers, autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. More recently, significant advances in biochemistry and molecular biology have enabled researchers to find master switches of various OS mechanisms and associate OS development to many biological paradigms. In this review, a brief overview of OS research is provided to offer insight into its future directions. Most importantly, the need for a greater understanding of the OS molecular mechanisms and its vital role in the progression of many disorders is emphasized. Likewise, more work is needed on the utility of reactive oxygen species markers as a diagnostic tool.",

Sterol side chain reductase 2 (StSSR2) is a key enzyme in the biosynthetic of SGAs in potatoes. To reduce the concentration of SGAs in tetraploid cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), the gene StSSR2 was edited by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. A total number of 64 mutant lines were generated, and the mutation efficiency was 46%. The percentage of insertion was 6.25%, and the percentage of deletion was 93.75%. Compared to the wild-type (WT), the content of SGAs reduced significantly in the mutated potatoes. The lowest SGAs concentration was 54% of the WT level, which was recorded in the peels of line #360. In the tuber fleshes, the lowest SGAs were 66% of WT level, which was found in line #378. In the leaves, the lowest SGAs concentration was 44% of the WT level as found in lines #204 and #378. In a word, our results showed that the StSSR2 gene of tetraploid cultivated potato could be successfully edited by the CRISPR/Cas9 system to reduce toxic SGAs.",

The effects of compost and coffee-husk biochar application at different rates on the biomass production and chemical composition of Desho grass in acidic soils in a tropical environment were examined to test the synergetic impact of compost and biochar on forage yield and quality and to identify the best coapplication rates for forage production. The economic benefits of the treatments also analyzed. Compost and biochar application considerably improved biomass production and organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP) contents but reduced dry matter, ash and fiber contents. In particular, compost and biochar coapplication at full rates (4.5 and 5.0 t ha−1, respectively) produced the highest fresh and dry biomasses and OM and CP contents and the lowest ash and fiber contents. However, compost and biochar coapplication at half rates (2.25 and 2.5 t ha−1, respectively) provided the greatest economic benefit, while compost applied alone provided the least economic benefit. This study highlights the synergetic effect of compost and biochar cousage on the yield and quality of Desho grass forage.",

The indigenous chicken egg production performance under the backyard system within the ranges of 30–80 eggs per hen annually, with an average egg weight of 38–45 g, laying 10–15.7 eggs per month. Indigenous chicken eggs had a hatchability rate of 78.6–85.8%, however more than 40% of chicks died before reaching sexual maturity. At hatch, local chickens weigh 27.1–28.8 g, whereas at maturity they weigh 1300–1600 and 987–1300 g, respectively, and indigenous male and female chickens reach sexual maturity within 23.48–26 and 20–28 weeks, respectively. Each exotic chicken produces 135–185 eggs per year in the village with a 43–52.5 g weight, but it may rise to 250 eggs with a 60 g weight in the marketable sector. Exotic chickens were low in hatchability, 39.3–76.1%. While their cross laid 33 eggs in 3.1 clutches in 31.6–38 days and their eggs weighed 40–49 g with 67.9–85.8% hatchability. Cross-breed chickens and exotics produce a weight of 27–40.1 and 35.2–38.8 g respectively.",

The availability of the complete genome of M. anisopliae and capable techniques for its transformation have brought several developments in its use as a pest controller. For prospects, more in-depth research to improve fermentation and formulation technologies is needed, while multistress-tolerant and engineering entomopathogenic strains are selected to promote the widespread acceptance and usefulness of M. anisopliae as a cost-effective fungal biopesticide. Here, we provide an overview of the pathogenesis and formulation strategies, as well as the host ranges and molecular approaches of increasing virulence and efficacy. Several studies of this fungus pathogen demonstrated that M. anisopliae can be an efficient biocontrol agent and has great potential for further research and development.",

GC-MS analysis evidenced a total of 12 bio-active compounds, and maximum at α-bisabolol (39.34%) followed by stigmasterol (13.45%) respectively. The larvicidal activity of CVO-MS against the malarial vector An. gambiae evidenced that the mortality rate was prominent at the maximum dosage of 1000 ppm. The Median Lethal Concentration (LC50) of CVO-MS was established at 488 ± 2.45 ppm, respectively. Enzyme inhibition assay showed that the CVO-MS delivers a significant upsurge in the level of CYP450, GST, and a decline in the level of α-β carboxylesterase activity in both the third and fourth instar (p ≤ 0.0001). The gut-histological examination of CVO-MS showed that there is severe damage in the mid-gut tissues, especially epithelial layer (EL), gut-lumen (GL), and peritrophic membrane (pM). The non-target screening against the mosquito predators (A. bouvieri, D. indicus, and third instar larvae of Tx. splendens) suggests that CVO-MS showed less toxicity as compared to Pestanal® (1 ppm) respectively. The present study has paved a new insight in understanding the bioactivity of CVO-MS as a potential larvicidal agent of malarial vector and non-toxic against mosquito predators.",

In addition, 60 shrimp farm workers were interviewed from each of the states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. The study revealed that all shrimp farm workers were male, 58% were migrants, and ages ranged from 23 to 53 years with work experience of 5 to 24 years. Few workers (14%) had no formal schooling and many had secondary-level education. Reported physical hazards were high (93%) followed by biological (82%), chemical (77%), ergonomic (71%) and psycho-social (71%) hazards. The majority of physical injuries reported related to slips, falls and cuts (51%), electric shocks (44%), sunburn (41%), dehydration/headaches (40%) and fractures (27%). Approximately 30%–39% had some chemical injury with skin infections/breathing problems. Indian shrimp farm workers face similar occupational hazards and injuries to shrimp farm workers in other countries. The occupational health and safety of shrimp farm workers should be integrated into the concept of 'One Health' to ensure aquaculture sustainability and safe, meaningful and good quality employment to workers.",

Hopeful results for dengue vaccine are far-fetched as the effectiveness are tied to previous dengue virus (DENV) exposure and billions of dollars needed to be invested for vaccine development. Medicinal plants are ideal alternatives to combat DENV infection as it has long been utilized in traditional medicine besides showing virucidal properties. However, the mechanism of action by which the plant compounds inhibits the viral replication machinery remains to be discovered. This review provides existing knowledge on how DENV replicates within the host cells, recruiting more than 70 medicinal plants and some essential oils with anti-DENV properties, highlighting possible viral targets for DENV inhibition. The possible mechanism on how phytochemicals modulates host immune system in DENV infection by inhibiting cytokine storm and vascular leakage, were also discussed. Based on the in silico findings, NS2B/NS3 protease is the most distinctive DENV inhibitor target. Most anti-DENV plants research stood at their initial stages and efforts should be channeled into further in vitro characterization, in vivo studies by employing larger subsets of human subjects, and in silico studies to facilitate the understanding of inhibition mechanism.",

A total of 48 bacterial and 24 yeast isolates were obtained from field-grown tomato leaves/fruits collected from Barka, Oman. The antagonistic activities of these isolates were evaluated against A. alternata using in vitro dual culture assay. Among the 72 bacterial and yeast isolates tested, one yeast (Meyerozyma guilliermondii) and two bacteria (Enterobacter roggenkampii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) showed inhibitory activity against A. alternata. Examination of hyphal morphology of A. alternata at the edge of inhibition zone using scanning electron microscopy revealed abnormalities such as twisting, shriveling, distortion and collapsing of hyphae. Postharvest treatment of tomato fruits with E. roggenkampii, P. aeruginosa and M. guilliermondii reduced the fruit rot lesion size by 60%, 57% and 50%, respectively, compared to untreated control. The antifungal metabolites produced by the antagonistic yeast M. guilliermondii were fractionated using thin-layer chromatography. Characterization of the bioactive fractions using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of different types of alkanes, predominantly tricosane and pentacosane, suggesting that volatile compounds, especially alkanes, produced by M. guilliermondii might also be involved in the suppression of A. alternata.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is a vital process in response to injury and infection. However, hyper-inflammation have been linked to the pathophysiology of diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancers, neuroinflammatory, respiratory, renal diseases and Coronavirus disease 2019. Apocynin is known as a nontoxic herbal compound with anti-inflammatory potential. This review aimed to assess the effects of apocynin in the attenuation of inflammation and identify its mechanism of action based on a narrative review of available evidence. The reviewed literature has shown that apocynin exerts the immunomodulatory effect through reactive oxygen species-dependent and –independent approaches in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, respectively. In the reactive oxygen species-dependent pathway, apocynin monomers are converted to dimers, consequently inhibiting NADPH oxidase activation to reduce reactive oxygen species levels. While, in the reactive oxygen species-independent approach, apocynin directly reduces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increases nitric oxide without affecting reactive oxygen species levels. In conclusion, apocynin shows various minor macromolecular functions such as reducing chemokine synthesis, inhibiting cell migration and division, suppressing platelet/endothelial interaction and platelet aggregation, blood–brain barrier permeability, and decreasing reduction infarct volume. It is also hypothesized that apocynin might be considered a complementary remedy for Coronavirus disease 2019 due to its role in modulating inflammatory responses.",

It starts with the measurement or observation of a phenotype followed by mapping of the causative loci or genes. In addition, forward genetic approaches are, unbiased in terms of gene identification since the phenotype is the primary level of measurement. Reverse genetics, on the other hand, analyzes the phenotype of an organism following the disruption of a known gene. To generate random mutations in an organism, various approaches such as X-rays, ultraviolet irradiation and chemical treatment are used. Genetic variation across the genome is measured using a set of markers that can distinguish between the two or more strains used in an experimental cross. The source of these markers has changed over the years with advances in technology and knowledge of genomic structure. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single nucleotide changes that are also detectable by PCR, and millions of them exist between inbred strains, providing even greater resolution for genetic mapping. Two of the most widely used mutagens for chemical mutagenesis experiments are ethylmethanesulfonate and ethylnitrosourea. The objective is to review approaches and use of reverse and forward genetics in plant breeding.",

On the results, experimental conditions for lipase inhibitory assay were proposed. Notably, 5 mM sodium deoxycholate as emulsifier not only maintains the assay homogeneity but also enhances lipase activity. Organic co-solvents to dissolve organic inhibitors including DMSO, EtOH, MeOH, IPA, AcCN [0–30% (v/v)] was found well tolerated by the enzyme. With 10% (v/v) glycerol, lipase solutions can be stored at –20°C for up to one month without significant loss of activity. The results reported here provide researchers the assay condition sets in which most inhibitors can be dissolved, and lipase activity is not severely affected. This could accelerate the rational development of novel lipase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease affecting over 250 million people worldwide. The disease is the second most prevalent neglected tropical disease after malaria. Treatment of schistosomiasis relies on the administration of praziquantel (also known as biltricide). Reliance on a single drug poses a threat to the public health system as the parasite may become resistant as shown by some laboratory findings. The possibility of the resistance rising to clinically significant levels has motivated the scientific community to search for new drug nominees. For a long time, natural products have always been a foundation for the identification of drug leads in the pharmaceutical industry. This paper reviews the progress made in the discovery of natural anti-schistosomal agents in the field of drug discovery. We focus mainly on natural products that have been tested on the schistosome parasite and exhibited potency. We also highlight applications of advanced techniques in drug discovery, with a major focus on computer-aided drug discovery methods. Specifically, we discuss structure-based drug discovery and ligand-based drug design approaches, with an emphasis on virtual screening.",

However, climate-change-induced drought may threaten medicinal plants' growth and metabolite production. This study examines drought effects on two medicinal plants common in the UK: Plantago lanceolata and Tanacetum parthenium. Under glasshouse conditions, we compared growth, chlorophyll content, and photosystem II efficiency (Fv/Fm) in well-watered vs. low-watered plants. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measured the concentration of parthenolide in T. parthenium and verbascoside in P. lanceolata leaves, with both compounds being the two most abundant with medicinal relevance. Results showed significantly reduced growth for both species under drought, though photosynthetic performance remained unaffected. Parthenolide content in T. parthenium decreased with low water, while verbascoside in P. lanceolata showed no significant change. This study highlights drought's impact on medicinal plants' growth and metabolite production, emphasizing the need for further research on environmental factors affecting secondary metabolites under climate change.",

There was a significant increase in the feed intake in zinc sulfate and zinc -methionine chelate treatments campare the control treatment (P < 0.05). Tibia ash was significantly higher in treatments containing sulfate and zinc methionine chelate than in the control treatment (P < 0.05). The tibia's cortical thickness was improved in laying hens receiving 30 mg/kg zinc-methionine chelate. The supplementation of zinc could lead to an increase of mineralization in bone tissue. According to the results, zinc supplementation can improve feed intake, egg weight and the optimal zinc absorption in tissues. Zinc-methionine chelate boosts tibial mechanical properties without compromising eggshell quality of laying hens at the end of a production cycle.",

Using plant species which can grow on saline degraded soils for energy production can be a sustainable approach because they do not compete for the agricultural lands and availability of fresh water. These plants can be cultivated with seawater without compromising their biomass for commercializing purposes such as lignocellulosic content and seed yields and could strongly benefit as energy plants. Optimizing biomass production and its economic conversion to the end product are, however, of paramount importance. The biomass of halophytes can be improved through studying unexplored aspects of these plants related to genetic manipulations. Here, we recommended current advances and highlight the key genetic approaches required in halophytes for biofuel production. Genetic approaches might lead to desired alterations in the composition of halophytic lignocellulosic biomass, including higher quantity of cellulose and hemicelluloses and lower lignin. In summary, the genetic manipulations in halophytes might lead to improvement in biomass compositions hence can be used as a feedstock for the production of biofuel on nutrient poor degraded soils.",

Salicylic acid (SA) is involved in the regulation of many physiological processes and has been widely used to improve plant drought tolerance. The hydroponic experiment was carried out on flue-cured tobacco variety K326. SA solutions (0.3 mM) were sprayed on the leaves every day for three days, after which 15% PEG-6000 was used to simulate moderate drought. The results showed that drought stress reduced the photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), and transpiration rate (Tr), while it enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline and protein content. Compared with PEG drought stress, SA improved the Pn, Gs and Tr by 45.74%, 26.82%, and 52.22% respectively. Besides, the activities of SOD, POD, CAT, protein and proline content increased by 44.27%, 50.18%, 25%, 34.69% and 24.88%, respectively, while the MDA content decreased by 23.89%. Furthermore, SA spraying increased the drought tolerance of tobacco by modulating the expression level of the genes associated with photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and photosynthesis-antenna proteins. Hence, SA spraying reduced the inhibition of drought on photosynthesis and stimulated the antioxidant system, thus improving the drought resistance in tobacco.",

Sewage sludge biochar (SSB) is considered to be a potential source of phosphorus (P) in soil. In this context, the efficacy of twelve LMWOAs in releasing SSB-bearing P was tested in a laboratory extraction experiment. Moreover, the potential effects of (i) biochar pyrolysis temperature (varying from 220°C to 620°C) and (ii) other elements in SS, to estimate the P bonds attacked predominantly by the LMWOAs, were also assessed. The results revealed citric acid was the most effective extraction agent enhancing the mobility of the SSB-derived P. P release was strongly affected by biochar pyrolysis temperature (the highest P release was from the 320°C biochar, significant at p < 0.05). Moreover, the results showed that P was released preferably from Fe-P bearing compounds in SS. Citric acid was recorded as less effective at releasing other nutrients, such as Ca, Mg, K, indicating the exceptional performance of citric acid in P release from biochar without substantial effect on the other nutrients.",

The effects of simulated drought stress on germination parameters were tested for tolerance and sensitivity in 59 barley accessions from all regions of Iraq and phenotypic, physiological, and biochemical responses associated with drought stress were investigated. Stress treatments with polyethylene glycol (PEG) reduced the germination rate and dramatically delayed the development of the seedlings. Significant changes in the physiological and biochemical profiles in barley accessions were observed. A smaller reduction in water absorption of seeds was observed across all accessions, while all biochemical characteristics except total flavonoid content were increased with the increase in water deficiency in most accessions. Among the 59 barley accessions, ABN was the most tolerant accession, while Black-Garmiyan was the most drought-prone. Significant relationships were found between most trait pairs, with 24 significant associations under no stress, 39 significant correlations under the 10.25% PEG treatment, and 60 significant correlations under the 20.50% PEG treatment. According to the key importance analysis, seed water uptake, total phenol content, soluble sugar content, and catalase are classified as relative significance traits for germination percentage, root and shoot length under stress conditions.",

In this study, aqueous extracts of 13 medicinal herbs were assessed for their ability to detoxify aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), the most potent and commonly occurring carcinogen in foods. Among them, herbal extracts of Hybanthus enneaspermus, Eclipta prostrata and Centella asiatica exhibited over 70% detoxification of AFB1. The degradation of AFB1 upon treatment with these herbal extracts was confirmed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. Two fractions (Rf 0.75 and 0.87) purified from H. enneaspermus by using thin-layer chromatography displayed in vitro AFB1-detoxifying properties. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of the active fractions revealed the presence of linalool and bornyl acetate as the major components suggesting possible involvement of volatile compounds of H. enneaspermus in the detoxification of AFB1.

This method avoids the hepatic first-pass impact, and many medications' systemic availability is limited to skin cells like hair follicles, reducing undesired side effects and increasing localised therapeutic benefit. The skin's barrier function makes it difficult for nanoparticles to penetrate the tissue, even if the barrier is partially impaired in cases of damage or inflammation, such as in skin cancer. This could make nanoparticle penetration easier. Although a lot of work has gone into producing nanoparticles for topical distribution, there has been very little success in getting them to the clinic to treat skin malignancies. We review the various forms of skin malignancies and current clinical care strategies. Clinical therapy and management are also illustrated, explaining various skin cancer treatment options.

The success of any livestock farming operation is highly dependent on the reproductive performance of animals. However, infertility has limited the proficiency of livestock and resulted in economic losses. For centuries, farmers utilised medicinal plants extensively in managing reproductive disorders. These plants have few to no side effects, are cheap, easily accessible and readily available. Among others, the inclusion of Moringa olifera leaf extracts for 14 days at levels of 100–300 mg/kg body weight improved sperm characteristics. Zingiber officinale root extracts at levels of 500–1000 mg/kg body weight for 3 weeks increased sperm count, viability and mobility and testosterone. Furthermore, the increase in the volume of ejaculate and sperm concentration has been observed in sheep when Leucaena spp were added to their diets at 100–300 g/sheep/day for 60 days. However, there is little literature regarding the use of medicinal plants on ruminants, as the majority of studies have been laboratory-based and have used experimental animals, including rats and mice. Thus, future research is required through in vivo and in vitro studies to ascertain the efficacy of these medicinal plants in male ruminants.",

In addition, we have determined whether cortisol concentration decreases with time. The study population was 48 women in the age range 20–51 years, all with hair of length of 24 cm or longer. The participants completed a questionnaire that examined exposure to life stressors and potential confounders. Competitive radioimmunoassay was used to extract and analyze cortisol levels in hair. The overall intraclass correlation for the participants was substantial (ICC = 0.38, 95% CI 0.29, 0.49), indicating a strong within-person correlation during the growth period. The median levels of cortisol were reasonably stable. Wash-out effects were small, even for those who reported that they washed their hair every day.We conclude that it is possible to detect hair cortisol concentrations every month at least two years back in time. Changes in hair cortisol concentration are more likely to be related to life stressors than changes due to time since growth.",

    "abstract": "Mass mortality events (MMEs) threaten the health of fish and are also a potential threat to the health and safety of workers. This paper presents findings from a desktop risk assessment exercise focused on potential aquaculture occupational health and safety (AOHS) hazards and risks associated with MMEs in Chile. The study reviews academic and grey literature, government regulations and MME reports and statistics to assess the scale and distribution of MMEs; identifies associated documented and potential health and safety hazards; and documents and assesses policy responses to MMEs in the Chilean context through the lens of health and safety. The paper documents the size and regional distribution of salmon MME occurrences in Chile from 2016 to 2022. It discusses AOHS hazards associated with MMEs such as exposure to hydrogen sulfide, drowning and diving-related illnesses and potential issues around accessing hospitals and hyperbaric chambers for workers in remote aquaculture regions, as well as exposure to antibiotics and antibiotic residues. Recent Chilean regulatory requirements around reporting and management of MMEs that have the potential to help reduce identified MME-related risks for workers are described and addressed.Key policy highlights Risk of mass mortality events (MMEs) in marine aquaculture is increasing as the industry expands and climate change increases fluctuations in marine conditions. Policies need to be developed to counteract these risks.MMEs-related worker accidents and environmental degradation point to the urgent need to develop environmental and occupational health and safety (OHS) guidelines that prevent MMEs and protect workers and the environment.The Chilean OHS guidelines related to aquaculture MMEs may be adapted and used in other countries.Surveillance programs on harmful algal blooms and antibiotic resistance (AMR) markers may be a preventive measure towards MMEs and exposure to AMR markers.",

However, there is a need to scale up OA in order to meet increasing consumer demand for organic foods. Against this background, this study examined the factors driving farmers to adopt organic vegetable production (OVP) and how much acreage they commit to it. We used structured questionnaires to gather data from 400 farmers in the northern regions of Ghana. To analyze the data, we used Heckman selection model in comparison to Cragg's double hurdle regression and standard Tobit regression models. The results show that sex, age, education, extension visits, farmer association membership, the timing of production, and access to marketing information are the key factors influencing farmers to adopt OVP. The farmer's age, land ownership, economic status, and farmer association membership are the key factors influencing how much acreage farmers commit to OVP. In order to expand OVP adoption and the organic share of total cropland, strategies are needed to support farmer associations and encourage farmer participation.",

    "abstract": "The global upsurge in antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) is putting immense pressure on healthcare. The spreading of antimicrobial resistance is facilitated by mobile genetic elements, most especially plasmids. The widespread use of antibiotics in clinical and veterinary environments creates selective pressure that drives the evolution of ARB. Plasmids contribute to the propagation of AR in different types of clinical infections. The role plasmids play in this evolution necessitates their utilization in molecular surveillance to detect the emergence of ARB and track the spread of AR plasmids. Recent technologies like replicon typing and whole genome sequencing (WGS) have become the gold standard for molecular epidemiology of plasmids for the detection and control of epidemics in clinical settings. Unfortunately, access to such technologies is limited in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The major aim of this review is to examine the specific contributions of plasmids to the upsurge of AR in clinical settings and elucidate the various replicon types that have been attributed to specific antibiotic-resistant infections in healthcare settings. Healthcare in LMICs should be supported to build capacity in WGS and molecular surveillance to effectively prevent and control AR bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) has a significant impact on the health and development of plants. Depending on the wavelength, UV is divided into three regions according to their wavelengths: UVC (less than 280 nm), UVB (280-315 nm), and UVA (315-400 nm). Although high UV levels have been shown to harm plant growth, low doses of UV stimulate the synthesis and buildup of healthy compounds that absorb UV, and it has positive effects on the nutritional value and productivity of various fruits, ornamental crops, and vegetables. However, there is little recent data on the use of UV radiation to improve the quality of agricultural production. This review discusses various UVA, UVB, and UVC radiation applications for pre- and post-harvest agricultural production improvement. Both UVA and UVB boost plant resilience to environmental pressures by increasing their antioxidant power through the manufacturing of secondary metabolites like flavonoids and phenolics. UVC radiation has strong germicidal qualities that improve the quality of fruits and the shelf life of fresh foods, which is something that consumers who prefer healthy, organic food urgently need right now. This review offers essential knowledge and methods for using UV radiation as a safe tool to increase global food security.",

Resveratrol (Res), with a structure name of 3,5,40-trihydroxystilbene, is a kind of natural polyphenolic chemical with plenty of useful characteristics such as anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative stress. However, the impact of Res on PIPNP remains unclear. Therefore, the current study intends to examine the analgesic effect of Res on PIPNP. In the present study, the results revealed that Res could effectively prevent the development of paclitaxel-induced PIPNP in a dose-dependent manner when repeated doses of Res were given during PIPNP induction. This prophylactic effect of Res was involved in inhibited paclitaxel-induced up-regulation of TRPV1 instead of TRPA1 in the dorsal root ganglia. Furthermore, the inhibition of TRPV1 up-regulation by Res may be involved in a phosphorylation of ERK mechanism. In summary, we conclude that Res plays an intriguing role in the prevention of PIPNP and thus may work as a therapeutic compound for treating and preventing PIPNP.",

Because of ongoing habitat damage, this species is on the verge of extinction. However, the genetic diversity of wild oak populations has yet to be measured. Semi-arbitrary [Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)] and gene-targeted [Conserved DNA derived polymorphism (CDDP)] markers were employed separately or in combination to investigate genetic diversity within and among 85 Iraqi Mazu (Q. infectoria) accessions based on geographic origin. A total of 88 polymorphic alleles were produced in this investigation utilizing nine CDDP primers, with an average of 9.78 alleles per primer. The mean values for the major allele frequency (MAF), polymorphism information content (PIC), and marker index were 0.23, 0.29, and 2.79, respectively. Twenty ISSR primers were used to amplify 195 alleles (9.75 bands per primer), with MAF, PIC, and MI values of 0.21, 0.28, and 2.72, respectively. All accessions were divided into two major groups with multiple sub-groups based on Ward clustering and structure analysis. Within-population variance was calculated to be 94.17% using CDDP markers and 92.97% using ISSR markers. As per the fixation index values derived from the STRUCTURE analysis, there was a significant difference within the population. Increased gene flow was found among populations. The correlation (r) between the CDDP-based genetic distance matrix and the ISSR-based genetic distance matrix was 0.54, with a p-value of 0.001. The genetic dissimilarity calculated by CDDP and ISSR data revealed a wide range of diversity, demonstrating substantial genetic variation across accessions originating from various populations. This investigation's findings could aid in the conservation and further utilization of oak germplasm.",

Among the 36 endophytic bacterial isolates screened, three isolates designated as BEB1, BEB5 and BEB6 inhibited the mycelial growth of all the three plant pathogenic fungi tested and recorded more than 10% growth inhibition. Scanning electron microscopic observations of hyphae of the pathogenic fungi at the periphery of the inhibition zone in the dual culture plate revealed morphological abnormalities such as shrinkage, pit formation and loss of turgidity. These isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis (BEB1) and Bacillus cereus (BEB5 and BEB6) based on the MALDI Biotyper analysis. The Bacillus subtilis strain BEB1, which exhibited the highest level of antagonism, was tested for its sensitivity to cyanide and potential to degrade NaCN. The results revealed that this strain was capable of growing in a medium containing 5 mM of NaCN with a degradation efficiency of 53.8%. This endophyte is valuable for exploitation as a biocontrol agent to control diseases especially in the cyanogenic plants and bioremediation of cyanide from the industrial effluent.",

This study investigated the anti-obesity effects of individual or combination treatment with Spirulina platensis and green coffee bean aqueous extracts in high-fat diet-induced (HFD) obese rats. Methods: Rats were fed on HFD to induce obesity. Corn oil in the HFD accounted for 50.98% of the calories. Fifty rats were divided into five groups (10 rats/group): control, HFD, HFD-Spirulina, HFD-coffee, HFD-Spirulina and coffee cotreatment groups. The serum levels of lipid, leptin, and insulin, as well as the hepatic mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α), and peroxisome proliferator-activated alpha receptor (PPARα) were estimated. Results: The Spirulina and/or green coffee bean aqueous extracts decreased the final bodyweight and liver weight, and the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. The extracts decreased the serum levels of total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, leptin, and glucose, and enhanced the serum insulin level. Furthermore, the extracts enhanced the PGC-1α and PPARα mRNA levels and decreased the FAS mRNA levels. Conclusion: The individual or combination treatment with Spirulina platensis and green coffee bean extracts decreased obesity-induced hyperlipidemia and they can be potentially used to treat obesity.Abbreviations: ACC: Acetyl Co-A carboxylase; AF: Activity factor; ALP: Alkaline phosphatase; ALT: Alanine amino transferase; AMP: Adenosine monophosphate; AMPK: AMP activated protein kinase; AST: Aspartate amino transferase; BMI: Body mass index; cAMP: Cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CBE: Coffee bean extract; CVD: Cardiovascular disorder; DRD4: Dopamine receptor D4; FAS: Fatty acid synthase; FFA: Free fatty acid; FTO: Fat mass and obesity gene; GOD: Glucose oxidase; G-6-P: Glucose-6-phosphatase; HDL-C: High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; HFD: High-fat diet; HMGRCR: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase; LDL-C: Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; LXR α: Liver X receptor α; MC4R: Melanocortin 4 receptor gene'; NO: Nitric oxide; PGC-1α: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha; PPARα: Peroxisome proliferator-activated alpha; PPARγ: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; REE: Resting energy expenditure; ROS: Reactive oxygen species; TC: Total cholesterol; T2DM: Type 2 diabetes; TG: Triacyl glycerol; TP: Total protein; VLDL: Very low-density lipoprotein; WLS: Weight loss surgery",

Little information is available on leaf spot diseases of date palm in Oman and in the world. This study was conducted to identify the most common fungal pathogens associated with leaf spot diseases of date palm. A total of 198 symptomatic leaf samples were collected from seven districts in Oman. Isolations revealed that most isolates belonged to the genus Alternaria. Molecular-based identification using multigene sequences revealed that the isolates belonged to Alternaria alternata, A. burnsii, A. tomato, Curvularia subpapendorfii, Didymella microchlamydospora, Fusarium brachygibbosum, F. incarnatum-equiseti and Nigrospora lacticolonia. In pathogenicity tests, A. alternata was found to be the most aggressive. F. incarnatum-equiseti was the least aggressive, only inducing symptoms in leaves injured prior to inoculation. The other species caused moderate leaf spot symptoms on the leaves. This study shows that several fungal species belonging to different genera can be found associated with leaf spot symptoms of date palms, and they vary in their aggressiveness on date palm leaves. It is the first study to report C. verruculosa, D. microchlamydospora, and N. lacticolonia as leaf spot pathogens of date palm in the world.",

Dogs are a robust model for invasive UC as tumor development and progression is similar in humans and dogs. Recent studies in humans have revealed alterations in urine microbiota in individuals with UC; however, microbial alterations in dogs with UC have not been evaluated. The objective of this pilot study was to compare the urine and fecal microbiota of dogs with UC and matched healthy controls. DNA was extracted from urine and fecal samples followed by 16S rRNA sequencing and analyses using QIIME2 and R. Dogs with UC had significantly decreased microbial diversity (Kruskal–Wallis; Shannon, p = 0.048) and altered microbial composition (PERMANOVA: Unweighted UniFrac, p = 0.011) in urine, but not fecal samples. The relative abundance of Fusobacterium was also increased, although not significantly, in urine and fecal samples of dogs with UC. A comparison of canine and human urine microbiota further revealed similarities in dominant microbial taxa across both host species. This study supports the value of dogs as a model for studies on bladder cancer and urine microbiota, and it provides a foundation for future work exploring host-microbe dynamics in UC carcinogenesis, prognosis, and treatment.",

Plantlets were satisfactorily acclimated to soils maintained in a growth chamber and subsequently in the open air for 10–20 days. Analyzing eight random amplified polymorphic DNA and eight inter-simple sequence repeat primers resulted in 53 and 60 distinct bands, respectively. Uniform banding patterns suggest the genetic uniformity of the micropropagated plants. The results offer an accurate identification of A. zerumbet from any plant tissue. The micropropagation protocol would be helpful for economically feasible and environmentally sustainable exploitation of this valuable plant.",

However, optimal production requires the use of economical native microalgal species which are well adapted to local climatic and ecological conditions. Therefore, this study's main objective was to isolate and select local microalgal species for prospective biofuels production. Serial dilution and streak plate techniques were used to isolate four species: Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Oscillatoria and Microcystis from Manyame River, Zimbabwe. The isolates were evaluated for their biomass and lipid productivity under artificial lighting (8:16 h light/dark cycle) and a temperature of 25 ± 3°C. Lipid quantification was done gravimetrically, using hexane as an extraction solvent. Each isolate's performance was compared against that of an imported Chlorella vulgaris strain. Amongst the isolates, Chlorella sp. exhibited a highly competitive growth rate of 0.26 d−1 and lipid yield of 37.16% dry cell weight. In comparison, the imported C. vulgaris had a growth rate of 0.226 d−1 and lipid yield of 35.74% dry cell weight. Although findings suggest that the native Chlorella sp. is the ideal candidate, growth enhancement and genetic engineering techniques may be used to further improve its biomass and lipid yield.",

Chili is produced as a source of income for smallholder farmers covering a large share of the national as well as export market. A field experiment was conducted to study the association of green pod yield (FYD) and 11 yield-related traits in 29 chili genotypes under flood irrigation conditions in Ethiopia. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three biological replicates. Phenotypic and genotypic correlations and path coefficients were analyzed for FYD and 11 yield-related traits. The genotypic and phenotypic correlation coefficients showed that all investigated traits, except days to 50% flowering and days to the first harvest, showed a positive and significant correlation with FYD. The phenotypic path coefficient analysis revealed that the number of flowers per plant (NFP, 0.4114), and fruit length (FL, 0.3678) showed a significant (p < 0.01) positive direct effect on FYD. The genotypic path coefficient showed a significant (p < 0.01) positive direct effect of NFP (0.7968), number of primary branches (0.3982), and FL (0.3982) on FYD. The traits with positive direct phenotypic and genetic effects on fruit yield indicate that improving these traits could increase fruit yield.",

Toxic metals are known as endocrine disruptors and as they are widespread in nature they may be linked to reproductive problems. This study was conducted as a cross-sectional study and its aim was to examine the dose-response relationship between cadmium, arsenic, mercury, chromium and nickel and serum hormone levels of testosterone (women) and estradiol and progesterone (men) using the Benchmark dose approach (BMD). Blood samples were collected from 218 women and 217 men digested in a microwave, and the levels of the tested metals were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Dose-response analysis was performed in PROAST software (version 70.1). The model averaging method was used to calculate the Benchmark dose interval (BMDI). A dose-response relationship has been established between all metals and hormones. The narrowest BMDI was found for the As-testosterone and Hg-testosterone. Levels estimated to produce the extra risk of testosterone serum levels disturbances of 10% were lower than median levels measured in the general population. Moreover, this research suggests the possibility of use of the BMD approach in analyzing data pool generated from extensive human-biomonitoring studies.",

    "abstract": "Edible insects have sparked more research interest as a cheap alternative protein source to replace soya bean and fish meal in animal diets due to their good nutritional value. In general, information on various insects has been widely researched globally. In Africa, the available literature focused more on traditional harvesting of edible insects for use as food and feed. The collection of insects in the wild is considered unsustainable since it leads to overharvesting, endangering and extinction of insects, consequently destabilising the ecosystem. This review discusses and compares the recent findings on the nutritional composition of common African edible insects with nutrient requirements of livestock. This is followed by compiled data of their proximate composition, amino acid, mineral, fatty acids and vitamin contents as derived from the literature. The review also describes insect availability, quantity, quality and production systems used to rear insects for animal feeding in Africa. Insect market demand, benefits and challenges of producing insects as livestock feed are summarised. Lastly, the legislations and regulations imposed on insect harvesting and rearing are thoroughly discussed. The current review findings will provide valuable answers to the present status of sustainable insect production in Africa to meet animal nutrient requirements.",

The partial substitution of MF with organic fertilizer is considered eco-friendly and more efficient in improving soil fertility. In our study, the effects of MF alone and the combination of MF and organic fertilizers (MOF) on soil phosphorus (P) availability in infertile soil with P deficiency were studied with the initial soil without any addition as the control. The addition of MF and MOF increased the soil labile P (resin-P and NaHCO3-Pi) by 101.8% and 320.1%, respectively, compared to the control after 180 days of treatment. Resin-P was the predominant P fraction in MOF, accounting for 28.0% of the total P. The proportions of residual-P in MOF were 5.6% and 8.3% lower than those in MF and control, respectively. The P activation coefficient in MOF was the highest (15.0%), and was the main contributor to soil P fractions based on redundancy analysis. Our results suggest that the combined application of organic and mineral fertilizers is more efficient in improving soil P availability than mineral fertilizer alone. We highlight the joint application was beneficial to improve soil P activation coefficient.",

The results demonstrated that T. yunnanense TM10 inhibited the growth of P. oryzae and R. solani through mechanisms such as competition, mycoparasitism, and antibiosis. Dual culture, filtrate culture, and double plate assays showed that T. yunnanense TM10 could inhibit the growth of both P. oryzae and R. solani. Slide culture and scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests confirmed that T. yunnanense TM10 exhibited mycoparasitic activity, including attachment, coiling, penetration, lysis, and destruction of pathogen hyphae. Additionally, T. yunnanense TM10 was capable of producing cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) such as chitinase and cellulase, as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The multifaceted abilities of T. yunnanense TM10 for limiting the growth of P. oryzae and R. solani underscore its potential as an effective biocontrol agent for enhancing productivity and sustainability in rice cultivation.",

The effects of gastric cancer cell line-derived exosomes on BMMSC migration and the effects of conditioned medium from educated BMMSCs on tumor cell migration were analyzed. Our results demonstrate that exosomes derived from gastric cancer cell lines activate the AKT/c-Myc pathway of BMMSCs and upregulate PD-L1 expression on BMMSCs. Moreover, the pro-migration effect of exosomes from gastric cancer cell lines on BMMSCs is dependent on PD-L1. The upregulation of PD-L1 on BMMSCs promoted the migration of gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, tumor-derived exosomes could upregulate the expression of PD-L1 on BMMSCs to promote tumor migration. Our results provide a new therapeutic avenue in gastric cancer.",

We assessed the interaction effect of N fertilizer and biochar of different particle sizes and rates on NUE, growth and yield of lettuce. A factorial design arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications was used to conduct a field experiment at the FRNR farm, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana. The treatment consisted of biochar at 8.33 t and 16.67 t ha−1 with different particle sizes (<2, 5 and 10 mm) and five rates (0, 31.3, 62.5, 93.83 and 125 kg ha−1) of inorganic N fertilizer. Our result showed that integrating 8.33 t ha−1 of <2 mm and 5 mm biochar with 62.5 and 93.8 kgN ha−1, respectively improved lettuce growth, NUE by 30% and yield. The yield (19.3 t ha−1) obtained with these applications is comparable to the achievable yield (20 t ha−1) of lettuce under the sole N recommended rate (125 kgN ha−1). In conclusion, with 8.33 t ha−1 of <2 mm biochar, farmers can reduce the recommended inorganic N rate of lettuce by half (62.5 kg ha−1) and still attain good yield with improved post-harvest soil fertility.

Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study empirically investigated the relationship between TAM constructs, namely Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude towards Use (ATT), and Behavioral Intention (BI) to use BSFL. The study used a cross-sectional survey design to collect primary data from 211 randomly selected cage operators (98) and pond farmers (113) in Kenya's Siaya, Kisumu, and Homabay Counties. A structural equation model was employed to examine hypothesized paths in the uptake of BSFL meal with the aid of SmartPLS 3. The inner model path coefficients suggested that ATT had the strongest effect on farmers' intentions to adopt BSFL (0.411). Further, PU had a greater relative influence on intention to adopt BSFL than PEOU based on the model path coefficients of 0.319 and 0.178 respectively. This indicates that the more respondents believe BSFL is useful in their fish farm's production conditions, the more likely they are to adopt BSFL.

To reduce environmental contamination, portable pulsed ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection devices are increasingly used. However, their virucidal efficacy has not been fully clarified. Methods: This experimental study evaluated the efficacy of a portable pulsed UV device against five viruses: feline calicivirus (FCV, F4 strain), influenza A virus (IAV, A/NWS/33 strain), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2, UW 268 strain), poliovirus type 3 (PV-3, Sabin strain), and SARS-CoV-2. Viruses were irradiated for 1, 5, or 10 s at distances of 1, 5, or 10 cm. Experiments with FCV, IAV, HSV-2, and PV-3 were conducted at Chubu University under BSL-2 conditions. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed at Tohoku University under BSL-3. Results: The device demonstrated significant virucidal activity, particularly at a distance of ≤5 cm and exposures of ≥5 s. Both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were effectively inactivated. Conclusion: This study shows that a portable pulsed UV device can rapidly inactivate diverse clinically relevant viruses, supporting its role in environmental decontamination in emergency care.",

The bacterial 16S rRNA V3–V4 variable region was used to generate high-throughput sequencing data from fish organs with significant lesions. Microbiological testing for pathogenic bacteria and regression infection tests were performed. Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method was employed to evaluate the susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to 16 antibiotics commonly used in fishponds. Results revealed that diseased fish exhibited raised skin, large petechiae on body surface, pale liver, ruptured kidneys, and ascites. High-throughput DNA sequencing revealed that Aeromonas constituted a prominent component of the microbiota in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of diseased fish. Pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased fish harbored the following virulence genes: A. hydrophila (hly+, ahp+, aer+), A. sobria (ahp+, ahal+, act+), and A. veronii (ahal+, act+). Co-infection with all five virulence genes (hly+, ahp+, aer+, ahal+, act+) was more pathogenic than infection with any subset of these genes. The five dominant isolated strains exhibited sensitivity to enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and doxycycline, however, were resistant to midecamycin, vancomycin, and penicillin. These findings urge aquaculture management strategies emphasizing Aeromonas co-infection surveillance, targeted fluoroquinolone/tetracycline therapies, and biosecurity enhancements to mitigate environmental persistence of multi-virulent strains.",

Scanning electron microscopic observation of hyphae of the phytopathogenic fungi from the dual culture plate revealed morphological abnormalities such as loss of turgidity, shrinkage and disintegration of the hyphae. Analysis of the metabolites produced by these endophytic fungi by GC-MS revealed the existence of various fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters, hydrocarbons and alkanes, which have been previously demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity.

Therefore, this study describes the anti-hyperalgesia and anti-allodynia effects of Tiliacora triandra (TTE) in CISP induced peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy was established in rats by intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 mg/kg of CISP once a week for 4 weeks and the rats were concurrently treated with TTE (250 and 500 mg/kg, po) daily for 5 weeks. After the treatment, thermal hyperalgesia, motor coordination (rotarod test), mechanical allodynia, acetic acid writhing and formalin tests were evaluated. The rats were sacrificed and blood samples were collected for estimation of haematological parameters. TTE significantly restored motor coordination deficits induced by CISP and TTE-treated rats showed marked improvement in thermal/chemical hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. Additionally, treatment with TTE also increased haematological parameters including haemoglobin, platelet count, WBC and RBC compared to CISP-treated group. These findings demonstrated that TTE effectively ameliorated CISP induced peripheral neuropathic pain in a cisplatin paradigm.",

Due to its high transmission and infection rate, it has spread around the world and has transformed into a ravaging global pandemic with enormously unprecedented impacts globally on human, social, and economic health. Just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there is no specific antiviral drug for its treatment. The only available therapeutics are supportive and symptom-based. Thus, scientists are harnessing various strategies to expedite drug development. One such approach is drug repurposing through computational screening of phytocompounds, which leverages proteins that are essential for the entry, replication, pathogenesis, assembly, and release of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review the available literature on molecular docking of phytoligands against SARS-CoV-2 integral proteins, in a bid to update our current knowledge and identify the most promising molecules. The overwhelming majority of the promising lead compounds are either phenolics or terpenoids. Furthermore, of the elucidated SARS-CoV-2 targets, the main protease (3CLpro) appears as one of the most attractive druggable targets. Notably, compounds such as rutin, quercetin, luteolin, neoandrographolide, curcumin, and others with evident anti-inflammatory benefits, in addition to their predicted anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties, deserve further studies to validate their activity.",

Plant water depletions were determined by weighing the pots. The highest total amount of irrigation water (9.74 × 10−3 m3/pots) was observed in L0I100 control treatment and the lowest value (5.52 × 10−3 m3/pots) was obtained from L20I60 treatment. The highest WUE (41.63 kg/m3) was obtained from L10I80 treatment. The greatest yield (139 g), plant length (20.14 cm) and number of leaves per plant (28) were respectively obtained from L0I100 treatments. The greatest plant diameter (37.05 cm) was obtained from L10I100 treatment. Present findings revealed that L0I100 treatments were prominent for yield and L10I80 treatments for WUE and plant nutrient uptake. Lactuva Sativa Var. Crispa exhibited a strong dependence on water; yield and growth parameters were adversely influenced from I60 deficit irrigation treatments. Additionally, plant water consumptions decreased with Leonardite treatments.",

However, African and Asian farmers' produce is rejected at the international markets due to non-compliance with certification schemes amid food safety and environmental and labour infractions. Meanwhile, there is a sparsity of a coherent review of the knowledge landscape related to certification standards compliance and its drivers' even though top-level insights are needed. Therefore, this study performs a comprehensive systematic review and bibliometric analysis of existing literature to provide insights into publication trends, critical articles, and research sponsorship contributors. It was revealed that, specific certification schemes and value chains are under-represented, with Germany being the most influential contributor to agricultural certification compliance-related studies. While the effect of most factors are mixed in the existing literature, wealth, female household membership, years of certification, subsidy, social influence, government and donor support show positive effects. The study recommends increased international research partnerships to propel the development of the compliance knowledge area, which appears to be suffering maturation challenges, plus progressive research on compliance within the underrepresented contexts. Policy responses to upgrade producers' financial capacity or lessen compliance cost are suggested.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world, with increasing morbidity and mortality. The current diagnosis and treatment plan rely on early detection and comprehensive treatment based on surgery. Still, most patients are in the middle and advanced stage at the time of diagnosis, and the therapeutic effect is very limited. Immunotherapy is a new cancer treatment method. The most commonly used are immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically anti PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. However, immunotherapy has limitations, with its therapeutic effect closely related to the immune response in the tumor microenvironment. In recent years, the effect of arginine metabolism disorder on the occurrence and development of cancer and tumor immune regulation has attracted wide attention. Studies have confirmed that cancer cells cannot survive without arginine and arginine metabolites. In addition, arginine is essential for the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. High arginine levels can promote the anti-tumor immune response, thus increasing the effect of tumor immunotherapy. In this paper, the molecular mechanisms of arginine metabolism in the development and immune regulation of CRC are reviewed, with the authors hoping to provide potential evidence for the development of immunotherapy for CRC.AbbreviationCRC = Colorectal cancer, dMMR = Mismatch repair deficient, MSI-H = Microsatellite highly Instability, MSS = Microsatellite stability, TME = Tumor microenvironment, MHC = Major histocompatibility complex, pMMR = Mismatch repair proficient, NOS = Nitric Oxide synthase, NO = Nitric oxide, ASS-1 = Arginine succinate synthetase 1, ASL = Argininosuccinate lyase, ARG = arginase, CAT = Cationic amino acid transporter, AGAT = Arginine-glycine amidinotransferase, ADC = Arginine decarboxylase, ADI = Arginine deiminase, ODC = Ornithine decarboxylase, GCN2 = General control non-depressible 2, mTOR = Mammalian target of rapamycin, HIF-1 = Hypoxia-inducible factor 1, VEGF = Vascular endothelial growth factor, ICI = Immune checkpoint inhibitor, ORR = Objective response rate, DCR = Disease control rate, OS = Overall survival, PFS = Progress free survival, TIL = Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, TCM = Central memory T cell",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Prostaglandin E-major urinary metabolite (PGE-MUM) may be a good biomarker of inflammation and useful in monitoring diseases, without the necessity of invasive sampling. To see whether inflammation in muscles occurs during physical exercise, the influence of physical exercise on urinary PGE-MUM levels was analyzed in high school boys belonging to a soccer club.Materials and methods: Void urine samples were obtained before and after physical exercises 1 (mild exercise) and 2 (repeated mild exercise). To avoid the influence of a change in urinary volume, PGE-MUM values (ng/mL) were corrected by the concentration of urinary creatinine (mg/dL) and expressed as PGE-MUM·Cr (µg/g creatinine). Urinary total protein·Cr (µg/g creatinine) and L-type fatty acid-binding protein·Cr (µg/g creatinine) (L-FABP·Cr) were compared with PGE-MUM·Cr.Results: The PGE-MUM·Cr level increased significantly immediately after playing soccer (regular 'mild' exercise) in exercise study 1 or running (repeated mild exercise) in exercise study 2, but declined the next morning. PGE-MUM (ng/mL) levels in both exercises strongly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient, ρ = 0.728; 0.480, respectively) with urinary creatinine (mg/dL) thought to be derived from muscle exercise.Conclusion: The early increase in the PGE-MUM·Cr level just after physical exercise may reflect muscle damage and inflammation caused by the exercise.",

It has reached epidemic proportions in the Qinghai Province, China. To explore the primary epidemic strains, genetic evolution, and molecular characteristics of the disease, 90 samples were collected from various locations in Qinghai Province between July and September 2019. Molecular identification and genetic analysis identified BYDV-GAV as the predominant strain in Qinghai Province, with a detection rate of 92%. We successfully cloned 44 BYDV-GAV isolates with genome lengths of approximately 5.7 kb. Molecular population genetics analysis indicated low genetic divergence (genetic distance <0.1) among the geographical populations of BYDV-GAV in Qinghai Province. The low FST values (<0.33) and high Nm values (2.65–6.21) suggested significant gene flow and reduced genetic differentiation between isolates. Tajima's D value was negative, and the dN/dS value of the CP gene exceeded 1, indicating non-synonymous mutations, positive selection pressure, or diversified selection in the BYDV-GAV isolates from Qinghai Province. Phylogenetic analysis revealed nine distinct groups with a sequence similarity of 99% among the BYDV-GAV isolates, suggesting a common ancestral origin. These findings imply the relative stability of the disease in the Qinghai Province.",

Over the past few years, inflammation has been associated with the advancement and stimulation of several chronic disorders, including cancer, heart ailments, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and neurological diseases. In this study, phytochemicals and mineral profiling, and the anti-inflammatory potential of the n-hexane leaf fraction of I. wombolu (NHLFIW) were performed with phospholipase A2 and formalin-induced inflammation in rats. The fraction with gas chromatography-mass flame ionization detector (GC-FID) confirmed high concentrations of catechin, sapogenin, naringenin, steroids, and cardiac glycoside, whereas the mineral compositions using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) showed Ca2+ (8.08 mg/mL), Mg2+ (7.583 mg/L), Zn2+ (0.985 mg/L) and Se2+ (0.944 mg/L). The fraction showed high inhibitory efficiency on phospholipase A2, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde concentration (MDA) and other inflammatory markers with great enhancement of antioxidant defense systems. This was confirmed by a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in CRP, LDH and MDA of the treated groups when compared to the untreated (group 2). The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of NHLFIW in managing inflammation and its complications which can be primarily attributed to its phytochemicals and mineral components.",

Chang (S. reticulata subsp. amurensis) is a highly valued ornamental tree, however, its ornamental potential is constrained by its exclusive white flower phenotype, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying flower color formation remain largely unexplored. In this study, the detection of diverse anthocyanins and their derivatives in S. reticulata subsp. amurensis petals suggests the presence of a functional anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. However, the total anthocyanin content in its petals was significantly lower than in Syringa oblata Lindl. (S. oblata). The expression of structural genes and transcription factors in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway was significantly downregulated in S. reticulata subsp. amurensis petals compared to S. oblata. We isolated SrMYB1 from S. reticulata subsp. amurensis, and its overexpression in tobacco led to a marked increase in anthocyanin accumulation across multiple tissues. SrMYB1 upregulates MYB and bHLH transcription factors expression in transgenic tobacco plants, subsequently enhancing structural genes (NtCHS, NtDFR, NtANS, NtUFGT, and NtANR) expression and promoting anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our findings demonstrate that the white flower phenotype in S. reticulata subsp. amurensis is attributed to insufficient anthocyanin accumulation, which is primarily due to low expression of SrMYB1, a key regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis.",

This study was a quantitative, observational, case–control study that investigated the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and hypothyroidism in Erbil City, Iraq. We also examined the relationship between biomarkers (thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies) of thyroid function and vitamin D deficiency. The study revealed that 36.7% had moderate vitamin D deficiency, 25% had severe deficiency, 18.3% had insufficient levels, and only 20% had sufficient vitamin D levels. Among participants, 95%, 90%, and 82% had normal levels of T3, T4, and TSH, respectively. A remarkable inverse relationship was found between vitamin D levels and hypothyroidism (r = −0.294, p<0.05 for euthyroid participants and r = −0.326, p<0.05 for hypothyroid participants) as well as upward relationship between vitamin D supplementation and hypothyroidism severity (r = −0.859, p<0.01 for euthyroid participants and r = 0.604, p<0.05 for hypothyroid participants), suggesting an indispensable role of vitamin D in thyroid health. Autoimmune markers, such as anti-TPO antibodies and thyroxine dosage, were strongly associated with hypothyroidism severity (P < 0.01). Our findings highlight the significance of personalized dietary vitamin D regimens and supplemental forms in combating thyroid dysfunction on public health scales.",

    "abstract": "Why the sexual climax, in humans, results in a pleasurable experience remains an important biological question. Analysis of evolutionary traits in numerous Vertebrates suggests that orgasm evolved through three phylogenetic stages during the transition from external to internal fertilization and viviparity. First, orgasm is directly dependent on ejaculation in males and the expulsion of fluids from the ovarian and urethral glands (Skene's) in females. I propose that sexual orgasm could come from the primitive reflex of discharging gametes to ensure reproduction. Thus, the understanding of orgasm should not be reduced to a penis- or a clitoris-centred paradigm. Secondly, orgasm has evolved to stimulate sexual activity because the evolutionary transition from external fertilization to internal fertilization has been accompanied in numerous species with a lessening in reproductive rates. Because sexual activity encourages reproduction, it can be argued that orgasm has evolved to increase sexual activity, particularly in viviparous species with low reproductive rates. Third, internal fertilization in the genital tract of females weakens the visibility of the putative success of fertilization. Female sexual fluids and proteins can bias fertilization in favour of preferred males. Because orgasm could promote a better choice of partner, I argue that female orgasm may have evolved as a post-copulatory selection tactic by which females can increase their control of mates.",

This study was designed to investigate the hypolipidemic and hepatic antioxidant potentials of the methanol Leek extract (LE) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rat model. Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups (n = 6/groups) as 1) control fed standard diet, 2) HFD, 3) HFD + (Atorvastatin) (20 mg/kg), and HFD + LE (100, 200, or 300 mg/kg). All treatments were administered by gavage and conducted for 6 weeks, daily. At all tested, but in a dose-independent manner, LE significantly reduced final body weights and food intake and suppressed serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Besides, in inhibited serum and hepatic levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) but increased serum and hepatic levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Concomitantly, LE, at all tested doses increased the activity of superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), increased the levels of catalase (CAT) and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the livers of HFD-fed rats.

We investigated the molluscicidal effects of Cucurbita maxima seed extracts on Biomphalaria pfeifferi, and Bulinus globosus snails under laboratory conditions. For B. pfeifferi, we tested seed extracts on juvenile and adult snails while only adult B. globosus were available for testing. Snails were exposed to water and crude ethanol extracts for 72 h and significant concentration-dependent mortality rates were observed. The number of B. pfeifferi juveniles collected was not enough for a comprehensive investigation against both solvents. We, therefore, tested them against water extracts only. A lethal concentration of 0.02 mg/mL killed 50% of the snails (LC50) for both water and ethanol extracts on adult B. pfeifferi snails. Our results suggest that pumpkin seed extracts have a significant molluscicidal effect on B. pfeifferi and B. globosus snails. The LC50 values for all the extracts in B. pfeifferi and B. globosus snails are within the threshold set for potential molluscicides by the World Health Organisation. We propose that C.maxima seed extracts be considered as potential molluscicidal agents in Schistosomiasis transmission control.",

One-to-one propensity score matching (83:83) was used to match the baseline characteristics and confounding factors of patients so as to better evaluate effects of anemia and RBC transfusion. The results showed that the rate of severe anemia was significantly different between the BPD group and non-BPD group [14/83(16.87) vs 4/83(4.82), p = 0.013]. The number and volume of transfusion were significantly lower in the non-BPD group than in the BPD group [number:1(0,2) vs 2(0,4), p = 0.001;volume:30(0,40) vs 40(20,80), p = 0.004]. We find that Among anemic neonates,only severe anemia may increase the risk of developing BPD. Larger volume and higher number of RBC transfusions are related to BPD and its severity. Risk of BPD was neither related to the onset of anemia nor the timing of first transfusion. Medical methods should be adopted to prevent severe anemia and reduce RBC transfusions.Registration Name of registry: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Registry number: ChiCTR 2100042768.

The possibility of using two halophytes for the remediation of cadmium (Cd) from contaminated soils was investigated. Consequently, an experiment with Chenopodium album L. and Chenopodium botrys L. including Cd treatments of 0, 5,10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 ppm was conducted. Designated analyses including fresh weight, dry weight, and Cd concentrations in shoots and roots were performed. Results indicated that for both plants, a logarithmic model performed best to demonstrate the relationship between total soil Cd with shoot Cd and dry matter. Although both halophytes had considerable capability to remediate Cd from soils, C. botrys demonstrated greater potential to accumulate Cd in shoots. The range of bioconcentration factor (BCF) in C. botrys was obtained to be 0.8 to 8.8 and in C. album was 0.4 to 1.73. For C album, BCF in most treatments was lower than 1.0, but for C. botrys, it was mostly larger than 1.0. Although both plants can be used as hyperaccumulators to remediate Cd-polluted soils, the clean-up time of C. album under higher Cd concentrations was shorter than C. botrys L.",

The human microbiota plays a crucial role in the environment and human health under normal circumstances; nonetheless, dysfunction of the human microbiome has been associated with illnesses ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to multidrug-resistant infections. Culture-dependent human microbial exploration approaches are inadequate for discovering the diversity, abundance, and full genetic and metabolic potential of the whole microbial ecosystem. Hence, metagenomics analysis is a powerful advanced technology for comprehensively studying human microbial composition and diversity, exploring novel and antibiotic resistance genes, microbial metabolic pathways, functional dysbiosis, and co-evolution of the microbiome with the host. Therefore, owing to the increase in human microbiome sequencing projects in healthy and diseased people worldwide, it is feasible to explore the human microbiome using a metagenomics approach. Thus, this review focuses on the advancement of metagenomics for exploring the human microbiome, human microbiome metagenomics data processing, and analysis strategies. Currently used bioinformatics tools and their approaches are also discussed in the context of human microbial metagenomics.",

    "abstract": "We tested the effect of entomogenous fungi isolated from the Coleoptera species Ophrida xanthospilota and of the medicinal mushroom Lentinula edodes on the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. All the four analyzed strains of entomogenous fungi showed pathogenicity to D. melanogaster by causing 100% mortality of fruit flies within 20 culture days. The shortest lifespan was recorded in flies treated with Fusarium verticillioides (15 days). On the contrary, L. edodes showed a remarkable lifespan-extending effect on the model organism, with fruit fly individuals surviving for 55 culture days. Fungal growth was microscopically observed on the bodies of dead fruit flies treated with the four entomogenous fungal species, confirming that the tested fungi were responsible for the mortality of the model insects. Our findings showed that the four fungal species previously found on the body of Coleoptera individuals are entomopathogenic and could be exploited in agriculture applications for the biocontrol of noxious pests. The significant lifespan extending effect on Drosophila produced by the analyzed L. edodes strain could represent very important experimental evidence of the anti-aging and lifespan prolonging effects of this medicinal mushroom species.",

Herein we present the synthesis of two novel spacer-linked, anthraquinone-triphenylphosphonium (AQ-TPP) conjugates (4) and (5) as early lead compounds in a new class of agent designed to penetrate the lipophilic barriers of the membranes of a diverse family of species; and establish bacterial growth inhibitory properties against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 13616) and Mycobacterium smegmatis [mc2155] (as a surrogate for Mycobacterium tuberculosis). The MIC and MBC values of (4) and (5) were determined against MRSA and found to be equipotent [MIC for each: 1 µg/mL (1.2 µM)]. Whereas the amide-linked conjugate (5) was determined to have 2-fold greater bactericidal potency [MBC 1 µg/mL (1.2 µM] than ester-linked (4). The anthraquinone-TPP conjugates (4) and (5) were active in vitro against Mycobacterium smegmatis (graphical abstract) and were equipotent as determined by their MIC values; in contrast to MRSA, the less hydrophobic (4) had 2-fold greater bactericidal potency than (5) as measured by their MBC values. Notably, both conjugates showed potent intracellular growth inhibitory activity in infected THP-1 macrophages. The conjugates are promising leads for the development of new antibacterial drugs.",

The study analyzed the frequency of diagnosed TB cases, age-specific incidence rate, year of diagnosis, and prevalence of TB in Saudi Arabia from 2014 to 2020. Based on the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) data, 21,120 patients were diagnosed with TB. The mean incidence rate of pulmonary TB and extra-pulmonary TB was approximately 6.92 and 2.33 per 100,000 population, respectively. The highest age-specific incidence rate was observed in the 25–35 year age group. The non-Saudi population (11,086 cases; 52.50%) was significantly more affected by both types of TB compared to the Saudi population (10,034 cases; 47.50%). The male population of Saudi and non-Saudi was significantly more affected by both types of TB. The highest overall mean incidence rate per 100,000 population was observed in the Jeddah and Jazan regions. The study's findings may have implications for supporting public health interventions and implementing a more effective TB control strategy program in Saudi Arabia. It suggests that immigrants from TB-endemic countries and religious visitors from high-risk countries should undergo pre and post-arrival screening for TB to reduce its incidence.",

Autism, escalating as a global health concern, has yielded substantial discoveries in the past 40 years.

We searched for potentially relevant studies in three databases (Web of Science, PubMed and CINAHL) from inception until March 2024. In addition, we manually searched the bibliographies of the included studies to find articles that might otherwise have been missed. The search strategy was defined by identifying key terms from the research question related to 'autism', and 'etiology', 'diagnosis' and 'therapy'. To reduce the number of papers cited, the most recent review papers and meta-analyses were used whenever possible. We selected papers based on our judgement of the quality of the study or review paper, its relevance to controversial or commonly misunderstood issues, and whether the findings were clinically relevant. Finally, this paper summarizes the current status of autism research, looks forward to future research directions, and calls for more research to explore the pathogenic mechanisms, diagnostic basis, and therapeutic methods of autism.",

The increased levels of blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were noticed. In contrast, the levels of insulin and HDL-cholesterol were diminished. The oral administration of PHD showed a decrease in glucose level, cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol, whereas an increase in insulin level and HDL-cholesterol were recorded. What's more, the antioxidant enzymes in diabetic control rats showed significantly decreased activities of SOD, catalase, glutathione peroxide activities and reduced glutathione (GSH) compared to treated diabetic rats and the extent of LPO. These results showed that our formulated PHDs have possessed antioxidant potential. The effect produced by the PHD on various parameters was comparable to that of Metformin – a standard anti-diabetic drug.",

Moreover, it summarises the concept of mining by concisely stating the stages involved in mining and how the pollutants produced during mining can cause deleterious effects to aquatic flora and fauna. Environmental issues resulting from mining activities and how they hindered the progress of biodiversity were concisely discussed. Freshwater microalgae play an important role in the mitigation of the impact of pollution resulting from mining activities. The process of pollutants removal in freshwater by microalgae biofilm is by degradation and biosorption. However, it is an unestablished fact that the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were responsible for the biosorption of heavy metals from mining wastewater. It is also important to know the kinetic model that best explains the chemical and physical reactions of heavy metal absorption by the surface of microalgae biofilm.",

This study aimed to investigate the potential underlying molecular mechanisms. Tobacco variety K326 plants were divided into four groups, each receiving only the topping treatment (TW), the topping and 0.6 mM SA treatment (TS), the 0.6 mM SA treatment only (NS), and no treatment (control group, NW). The content of alkaloids and expression of genes related to nicotine synthesis were determined through gas chromatography-hydrogen flame ionization and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and analyzed between different groups. Finally, we constructed a DEG-pathway-differential metabolite network using Cytoscape. While SA treatment decreased the expression of genes related to nicotine synthesis and alkaloid content, topping showed the opposite results: transcriptome and metabolome analyses showed that both changed a variety of biological pathways and related gene expression in tobacco, including arginine and proline metabolism, tropane, piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, glutathione metabolism, biotin metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction. This study provides new insights for understanding how topping and SA treatment affect nicotine content in tobacco and provides a direction for future breeding.",

    "abstract": "Cashmere goats produce wool from primary hair follicles (PHF)and cashmere from secondary hair follicles(SHF). Numerous genetic factors have been identified to affect HF formation, but the mechanism that controls the distinct morphogenesis of PHFs and SHFs remains unclear. To better describe goat's hair follicle proteome, we applied iTRAQ technology to study protein expression profiling from nine skin samples of cashmere goats in three fetal periods including 45-day-old embryos (E45), 55-day-old embryos (E55), 65-day-old embryos (E65). A total of 1172 proteins identified are expressed in fetal skin. The numbers of differentially expressed proteins in E45 vs. E55, E45 vs. E65, and E55 vs. E65 were 103, 144, and 118, respectively. Sixty-three proteins were constantly increased through the whole embryonic developmental stages of placode formation. Keratin 1, 4, 5, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 75 belonging to the hair keratin family (KRTs) were identified during keratinocyte proliferation. Some proteins involved in these pathways probably have a role in the HF and might be the mediators of HF initiation in Cashmere goats. Our systematic investigation identified some signaling factors that drive the large-scale cellular rearrangements necessary for HF initiation, which provide an insight into the fundamental mechanisms of cashmere growth.",

The application of propofol is expanding due to its advantages and the increasing demand for painless diagnosis and treatment. However, accumulating clinical and experimental evidence has shown that propofol can potentially be abused and is prone to causing addiction. To further understand the underlying mechanism of propofol addiction, our review places emphasis on explaining the roles of the mesolimbic, noradrenergic, and nitrergic systems in propofol addiction. We have focused on the role of the gamma-aminobutyric acid, glucocorticoid, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, adenosine A2A, and corticotropin-releasing factor receptors in the mesolimbic system in forming and maintaining propofol addiction. Furthermore, we have attempted to clarify the relationship between the dopaminergic pathway, extracellular signal-regulated kinase signalling pathway, and the ventral tegmental area-nucleus accumbens circuit in the mesolimbic system.Key Policy Highlights Although propofol is effective in inducing and maintaining anesthesia, it is prone to cause abuse and addiction.The mesolimbic, noradrenergic, and nitrergic systems are involved in propofol addiction.The dopaminergic pathway, extracellular signal-regulated kinase signalling pathway, and the ventral tegmental area-nucleus accumbens circuit in the mesolimbic system may be involved in the maintenance of propofol addiction.",

    "abstract": "The innovation in the proposed termite detection system can detect and predict the population non-destructively based on acoustic and temperature signals. This study aims to identify the characteristics of acoustic and temperature signals of subterranean termite infestation. Various termite populations were inserted into the pine board for 21 days as a feeding test, then infestation was monitored through the continuous acoustic-temperature signals response after 24 h. Based on the signal analysis, the peak of daily termite activity can be found in the afternoon, while the evening until early morning contained significantly less activity. This fluctuation was significantly associated with ambient temperature, the higher the temperature, the greater the activity. Furthermore, the signal analysis revealed that the higher the termite population, the warmer the board temperature with an average of 0.101°C. Based on the results, extensive knowledge is essential to effectively develop the signal processing package in the termite detection system.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to estimate the extent of genetic variability, heritability, and expected genetic gain attributable to agro-morphological traits and to suggest an effective selection scheme and specify promising genotypes for future oat breeding programs. One hundred twenty oat (Avena sativa L.) genotypes were evaluated at two locations in the central highlands of Ethiopia. The analysis of variance indicated that the mean squares due to locations and genotype x location interaction varied significantly for some measured traits while that of genotypes varied significantly (P ≤ 0.001) among all studied traits. Moreover, the estimates of genetic variability, heritability, and expected genetic advance indicate the presence of remarkable genetic diversity in oat genotypes and the magnitude of selection response for these traits in the population to develop superior genotypes for oat improvement. The result revealed that very high to moderately high heritability in a broad sense (h2b) coupled with high to moderate genetic advance as percent of mean (GAM) were recorded for forage dry matter yield (h2b = 64.4%; GAM = 19.3%), number of leaves at forage harvest (h2b = 86.4%; GAM = 19.9%), stem dry matter yield (h2b = 62.9%; GAM = 18.3%), forage yield production rate (h2b = 69.7%; GAM = 21.7%), grain yield (h2b = 64.2%; GAM = 26.1%), panicle length at grain harvest (h2b = 80.9%; GAM = 21.9%), number of spikes per panicle (h2b = 68.8%; GAM = 16.0%), and harvest index (h2b = 80.9%; GAM = 26.0%). The results suggested that these traits are governed more by additive gene action, and selection based on these traits could be effective to achieve the desired genetic gains for improvement. Therefore, high forage dry matter and grain yielding genotypes along with these desirable yield-related traits could be considered for selection in oat genotypes.",

Forty-five albino rats (180-200 g) were divided into nine groups of five rats each: Group 1 served as normal control. BPH was induced in groups 2–9 using dihydrotestosterone and estradiol. Group 2 served as BPH-control and group 3 was dutasteride-treated.

The effects of the extracts on the hematological and biochemical indices of the rats were assessed. At 400 mg/kg/d b.w, p.o. using a gavage, CME, MF and EAF decreased prostatic specific antigen by 55.91%, 57.54% and 56.75%, respectively comparable to 58.80% by dutasteride (an indication of improved prostate status). The extracts also restored BPH-modified hematological and biochemical status of BPH-induced-extracts-treated rats compared to BPH-control. These findings suggest that Z. portoricensis root extracts normalize aberrations associated with BPH and may justify the plant's folkloric use in the management of BPH.",

The use of different colour, shades of a hue and shapes for the system can motivate public to participate in environmental conservation. The colour used to represent WQI value on the map is derived from a single hue scheme of different quantities which produce varying brightness and shades. Web-based WQI index can be used to identify pollution sources based on the graphical representation of water quality trend.

Heart function data from Langendorff perfused Wistar rat hearts (n = 8/group) were digitally computed, and the infarct size was evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and cardiac enzyme levels. The total oxidants (TOS) and antioxidants (TAS) levels as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines levels were estimated by TOS and TAS assay kits and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were evaluated using RANDOX kits. Longtime treatment of DAF for 2 or 4 weeks normalized cardiac hemodynamics, vascular dynamics, and heart contractility. A significant reduction in the infarct size and cardiac enzyme levels (P < .05) was produced by DAF treatment. Short time infusion of DAF two hours before inducing ischemia yielded similar results. DAF treatment significantly (P < .05) decreased TOS levels in the perfusion effluent and increased SOD levels in the cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, treatment with DAF prevents the deterioration of cardiac function and ischemic injury caused by oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. The protective effects of DAF are possibly due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",

In this study, widely targeted metabolomics was employed to analyze the metabolic profile of 'Huabai 1', and compare metabolites between albino shoots of 'Huabai 1' (HBW) and albino shoots of the broadest cultivated cultivar 'Baiye 1' (BYW). A total of 359 differential metabolites were identified in 'Huabai 1'. Comparative analysis of differential metabolites revealed that 83 and 161 differential metabolites were specific for HBW and BYW, respectively. The phenylpropanoid and flavonoids biosynthesis are the key metabolic pathways, contributing to the color change in 'Huabai 1', while the purine metabolism and lipid-related metabolites may play important roles in regulating albinism in 'Baiye 1'. Comparative analysis of amino acids and catechins revealed that the umami taste of albino tea may be due to the internal balance of amino acid components and the decrease in phenol-ammonia ratio. In addition, lipid-related metabolites, the main contributors to the aroma of tea, were significantly enriched in BYW, while, HBW possess higher antioxidative components than that of BYW, such as apigenin and genistein etc., suggesting that the 'Huabai 1' may have high prospects in commercialization and future breeding programs.",

Results showed that composted and uncomposted rice straw in the 2nd flush had the highest dry matter (DM) content of 96.07% and 95.56%, respectively. The highest crude protein (CP) content (10.57%) was obtained in composted rice straw in the 3rd flush. The composted rice straw treated with P. florida had low organic matter (OM) content but high concentrations of ash, cellulose, and nutrient digestibility. These results indicate that the composted rice straw in the 3rd flush was found to be the best in terms of sufficient degrading of lignin content, minimum loss in cellulose concentrations, enhanced crude protein content, and nutrient digestibility. Therefore, it is recommended to develop spent mushroom substrate feed supplements for possible use in ruminants.",

It involves the design and construction of new biological systems and processes from standardized biological components, networks and synthetic pathways. The goal of Synbio is to create logical forms of cellular control. Biological systems and their parts can be redesigned to carry out completely new functions. SynBio is poised to greatly impact human health, the environment, biofuels and chemical production with huge economic benefits. SynBio presents opportunities for the highly agro-based African economies to overcome setbacks that threaten food security: The setbacks are brought about by climate change, land degradation, over-reliance on food imports, global competition, and water and energy security issues among others. With appropriate regulatory frameworks and systems in place, the benefits of harnessing SynBio to boost development in African economies by far potentially outweigh the risks. Countries that are already using GMOs such as South Africa and Kenya should find the application of SynBio seamless, as it would be a matter of expanding the already existing regulations and policies for GMO use.",

In this work, the population ecology of this leafhopper and the planning of insecticide treatments based on the recorded degree-days (DD) in a citrus orchard and vineyard separated by a windbreak (WB) of Cypress and Acacia were investigated. Leafhopper adults were monitored with five yellow sticky traps for each experimental unit and removed weekly from April to August for identification and counting. The sampling indicated the presence of five peaks of adult flight during 2017 and seven during 2018. Whereas six generations were predicted each year according to DD recorded until mid-August. Leafhopper populations were present on WB plants throughout the study period, and its preference for Acacia over Cypress was observed. During 2018, insecticides used were applied one week after DD predicted new generations on WB plants, and they were also applied on grapes at second, third, fourth and fifth adult peaks. The use of DD to predict the outbreak of new generations is discussed as a promising strategy to manage leafhopper populations below economic thresholds.",

A systematic literature search was conducted in three databases namely Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science to retrieve articles published between 2000 and 2020 where cholesterol esters were the primary or one of the primary examined molecules as part of research targeting immunity and antimicrobial operations. The findings showed antibacterial properties of cholesterol esters, their synergistic activity with antibiotics, antimicrobial role of cholesterol esters in upper respiratory tract and its diseases in humans, and correlation of cholesterol esters with infection protection in physically active individuals. Overall, there is strong evidence that cholesterol esters have antimicrobial properties. However, the currently pooled information available for cholesterol esters' antimicrobial properties is not expansive enough to draw a conclusion on its ability to replace existing antibiotics as a treatment for infections and this warrants future investigation.",

The effects of water, chloroform and methanolic leaf extracts were compared with the effects of the phytosynthesised silver nanoparticles on burn wound infectious bacteria. Dried leaves were extracted using the maceration technique, followed by filtration and concentration of the filtrate using a rotavapor. Drying was achieved by using a centrivap and appropriate masses were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to achieve 100 mg/ml concentrations. Silver nanoparticles were synthesised using the methanol extract of the plant leaves and characterised using a UV–VIS spectrophotometer. The disc diffusion method was used to assess the bacterial susceptibility levels with Ciprofloxacin as the positive control and DMSO and 1 mM silver nitrate as the negative controls. The green synthesised silver nanoparticles produced a yellowish colour with a peak at 420 nm wavelength. They exhibited antibacterial activity against all five bacteria; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis comparable to those of the B. boehmii leaf solvent extracts.

This study aimed to examine the response of Rhizobium inoculated common bean varieties to NPSB fertilizer application for nodulation, yield, and yield related traits. Three varieties of common bean (Local, Loko, and Nasir) were combined with four rates of blended NPSB (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha−1) fertilizers in randomized complete block design with three replications arranged factorially. The result revealed significantly highest number of total nodules (53.7), effective nodules per plant (35.54), number of pods per plant (7.4), plant stand count (87%), biomass (17.5 t ha1), seed yield (2996 kg ha1), and harvest index (16.67%) were recorded at the rate of 100 kg ha−1 NPSB which was 183%, 60%, 100%, 19%, 56%, 112%, and 33.3% increment over the control, respectively. Nodules fresh weight and nodules dry weight per plant showed 188% and 344.8% improvement over control, respectively. Nassir variety was higher in nodulation and yield, while Loko variety had long rooting which has implication on nitrogen fixation and plant nutrition.

This study indicated that the lipase inhibitory activity and the antioxidant activity found in Camellia pollen may exert dual benefits for preventing and treating obesity.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory infection is one of the leading causes of death in the world. The outbreaks of influenza and the Middle East respiratory syndrome have added to the miseries of human beings. Interventions such as the use of masks, social distancing, hand washing, and the use of personal protective equipment by health care professionals have minimized the transmission of pathogens from infected to healthy individuals. Another intervention is gargling which is most commonly performed by the Japanese to avoid respiratory infections. PubMed was used to search articles on gargling in respiratory infections published in the last three decades. Gargling is effective in upper respiratory infections (URTIs). URTI precedes lower respiratory tract infection; early intervention could prevent complications. The gargling agents in this review are classified as synthetic and natural gargling agents. The mouthwashes or gargling agents reviewed in this article have proven efficacy in reducing either bacterial or viral (or both) respiratory infections. The mouthwashes available over the counter may also have side effects. The use of mouthwash should be based on the potential benefit of oral and systemic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Avocado production is severely affected by anthracnose disease in the field and after harvest worldwide. This disease causes losses in the field due to fruit abortion and as post-harvest disease affecting quality and quantity during marketing and storage. The management of this disease has been through the use of chemicals that toxify human beings and contaminate the environment. So, the development of alternative bio-pesticide, which is environment-friendly, is imperative. Therefore, this study was carried out to find an alternative to fungicides currently being used in the control of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. This was achieved by evaluating the effectiveness of plant extracts from tree marigold (Tithonia diversifolia) and garlic (Allium sativum) in the inhibition of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in vitro. The antifungal activity of the extracts was determined by the evaluation of their effectiveness in inhibiting the fungal mycelial growth and sporulation on PDA media. Fungicide, Atracol 70WP used to control the disease, was used for comparison purposes. Data obtained were analysed by ANOVA and Fishers mean separation test using Gestart version 6 software. Concentrations of 80 g/l of Allium sativum and 120 g/l of Tithonia diversifolia were significantly effective as antracol fungicides at 2 g/l which is the recommended rate by the manufacturer in inhibiting mycelial growth and sporulation of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. However, further studies are recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of the extracts under field conditions.",

Group 1 was the normal control; groups 2–6 were induced with testosterone (5 mg/kg body weight) for 21 days following standard procedures. Group 2 serves as BPH-control, groups 3 received finasteride while 4–6 received orally 100, 300, and 500 mg/kg of EECSL, respectively for 14 days. Biochemical and BPH indices were analyzed. Oral administration of EECSL showed a decrease in prostate weight, Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), triacylglycerol (TAG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), malondialdehyde (MDA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) whereas an elevation in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), GSH and likewise antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were recorded. The histology photomicrographs showed that EECSL restored lesions of testosterone induction in the treated groups. Our study reveals that EECSL exerts potent on BPH, hypolipidaemic, and antioxidant potentials and justifies the claims by the traditional doctors in BPH management.",

To improve the above problems, a stem cell-based DDS was developed. Stem cell and its derivatives (cell membranes, extracellular vesicles/exosomes) have been used as important drug delivery vehicles in the treatment of a number of human key diseases, such as genetic diseases, cancer and so on. For stem cells highly express chemokine receptors such as CCR2 and CXCR4, which can specifically bind to chemokines or cytokines produced in tissue injury sites, so they exhibit centripetal and homing properties, which is the reason why they are employed as DDS vehicles. Stem cell-based DDS effectively enhance the targeting and efficiency of drugs with low immunogenicity. We review the extremely prominent superiority of stem cells and its derivatives as drug delivery vehicles. Especially summarize the different targeting strategies and the major application in anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, tissue repair and regenerative medicine fields. The challenges of stem cell-based targeted DDS are still how to enhance their targeting, selectivity, effectiveness, reducing immunogenicity, and fully exerting its immunomodulatory effects. We think stem cell and its derivatives-based DDS will demonstrate their significant prospects in the future.",

We found that the co-cultured maize benefited from the alleviated excessive Zn toxicity by its root-associated E. pisciphila, through significantly decreasing root Zn under Zn550 conditions, or promoting the nutritional Zn in maize shoots and roots by 34.03% and 22.13% under Zn0 conditions, respectively, compared with non-inoculated controls. Interestingly, H93 further enhanced the maize Zn tolerance by the bioaugmented Zn compartmentation in root cell walls to reduce the proportion of Zn in maize root soluble fractions and cell organelles under Zn550 stress. In exchange for the maize carbon cost, the H93 extraradical hyphae tended to accumulate more toxic Zn, compared with H93 mycelia in the in vitro culture under Zn550 conditions, and vice versa the co-cultured maize also promoted Zn tolerance of H93 via the repartitioning of subcellular Zn. Our results suggest the potentially mutual association of E. pisciphila and its host maize, by trading carbon for the increased abiotic tolerance.",

A total of 168 piglets from 15 litters were cross fostered and randomly assigned to three dietary treatments; 0% MOLM (control diet), 4.5% MOLM and 8% MOLM inclusion test diets. The feed conversion ratio (FCR), average daily gain (ADG), body weight (BW) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) and faecal viscosity (FV) were measured. The effect of MOLM inclusion level on FCR, ADG, BW, ADFI and FV was analysed using PROC GLM of SAS. Dietary inclusion of 4.5% MOLM significantly reduced the ADFI of piglets when compared to 0% MOLM, however 8% MOLM had higher ADFI than either 0% or 4.5% MOLM inclusion. There was no effect of MOLM dietary inclusion on ADG; however 8% MOLM dietary inclusion had a higher FCR when compared to 0% or 4.5% MOLM. Piglets in control treatment (0% MOLM) had more incidence of scours than 8% MOLM diet and did not differ from 4.5% MOLM. There was no effect in faecal viscosity between 4.5% and 8% MOLM diets. MOLM dietary inclusion significantly reduced the cost per kilogram weight gain. It was concluded that MOLM can replace soya bean meal up to 4.5% in piglet creep diets.",

It is necessary to identify certain disease curve elements for characterization of high variations in stem rust progress across different wheat cropping systems. A number of standard curves were fitted to a four-season data on stem rust severity to determine more predictive disease progress curve elements for wheat cultivars sown at different times. Exponential curve provided the best fitted parameters to be used as wheat stem rust progress curve elements. Sowing date and cultivar resistance significantly affected area under disease progress curve (AUDPC), maximum disease severity, and exponential parameter b. Mean AUDPC for early and late sowing dates were greater in susceptible cultivars (Bahar, Chamran II, Parsi and Sivand) than in resistant (Baharan and Pishtaz) and semi-resistant (Pishgam and Sirwan) cultivars. In semi-resistant cultivars, AUDPC increased by 37.44% at late sowings. Principal component analysis detected contributions of AUDPC, disease onset, maximum disease severity, and two exponential parameters in disease progression. This new understanding helps to achieve more accurate outcomes for future disease measurements for wheat breeding and wheat stem rust management programs.",

    "abstract": "Tef is a small-seeded staple crop endemic to Ethiopia. However, its yield is low, constrained partly due to improper agronomic practices and lodging. Thus, during the 2019–2020 cropping season, a field experiment was carried out at Reef Tokko Taanne Hamilee in Hababo Guduru district, Western Ethiopia to examine the effects of seed rate and inter-row spacing on growth, phenology, yield, and lodging severity of tef crop. Three levels of seed rates (10, 15, and 20 kg ha−1) and three styles of row spacing (10, 15, and 20 cm) were combined in a factorial combination in a randomized block design with three replications.Tef variety called 'Guduru' was used as planting material. The result showed that seed rate and inter-row spacing had significant (p < 0.01) effects on all phenological and yield-related characteristics studied. Moreover, days to heading, days to maturity, grain yield and harvest index were significantly affected by the interaction effects of both seed rate and inter-row spacing. Higher days to heading (68 days) and days to maturity (127 days) were recorded at a seeding rate of 20 kg ha–1 and10 cm inter-row spacing. Tef variety (Guduru) was taller (127.2 cm) under 10 kg ha–1 seed rate as compared to a higher seed rate of 20 kg ha–1 (120.8 cm). The highest dry biomass yield (51.3 kg plot−1) was obtained from a seeding rate of 20 kg ha−1 in combination with 20 cm inter-row spacing. Besides this, the maximum mean grain yield (19.8 kg plot−1) was recorded from 20 kg ha−1seed rate and 15 cm inter-row spacing to achieve a higher yield in the study area. Furthermore, the highest straw yield (35.99 kg plot−1) was produced from the highest seed rate of 20 kg ha−1, whereas the smallest inter-row spacing (10 cm) produced the highest straw yield (33.5 kg plot−1). The maximum harvest index (56.1%) was obtained from 20 kg ha−1 seed rate and 15 cm inter-row spacing, a similar treatment combination as in the case of grain yield. 10 kg ha−1 seed rate and 20 cm inter-row spacing showed lowest lodging severity (24.1%) and (32.3%), respectively. The result suggests that sowing of tef at 20 kg ha−1 seed rate combined with 10 cm inter-row spacing which resulted in higher grain yield, straw yield and harvest index, could be recommended in the study area to achieve higher tef production.",

However, since the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as a Class 2A 'probable carcinogen' to humans, the safety of this synthetic chemical has been under debate and requires validation. Most studies on glyphosate have been conducted in animals, and the effects of glyphosate in humans are not fully understood. In the present study, we report that glyphosate increases the rate of cell growth in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Interestingly, the concentrations of glyphosate ranging between 0.6 and 18 µM enhance cell proliferation, while lower or higher concentrations do not stimulate cell growth or interfere with it, respectively. At the molecular level, cell biology and biochemical data demonstrate that glyphosate promotes the transcription of EGR1, JUN, FOS, and MYC, which are critical transcription factors and immediate early genes for cell cycle progression, and cell cycle regulators including cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and p21. NEAT1, a long non-coding RNAs that is implicated in cancers and active gene transcription are increased in glyphosate-treated cells. In addition, the absorption efficiency of glyphosate to HEK293 cells estimates approximately 11 pM/cell/day, and glyphosate metabolism appears increased when incubated with HEK293 cells. Our findings provide valuable evidence on the effects of glyphosate on human cell growth and suggest that glyphosate promotes cell proliferation by activating gene expression of cell cycle regulators in humans in vitro.Abbreviations: IARC: International Agency for Research on Cancer; EPSPS: 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase; AMPA: aminomethylphosphonic acid; WHO: World Health Organization; EFSA: European Food Safety Authority; RT-qPCR: reverse transcription quantifying PCR; lncRNA: Long non-coding RNA; NEAT1: Nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1; WST: water-soluble tetrazolium salt; ChIP-PCR: chromatin immunoprecipitation-polymerase chain reaction; CDKs: cyclin-dependent protein kinases; MALAT1: metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcription 1; LC-MS-MS: liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.",

This single-center retrospective cohort study analyzed 432 patients with sepsis who were followed up for at least 30-days between January 2016 and December 2018. The endpoint was death from any cause. Patients were categorized into four groups according to baseline APACHE II score and UA concentration, and the relationships between these parameters and all-cause in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were analyzed. The in-hospital and 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 23.1% and 31.5%, respectively. Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that, after adjustment for confounding factors, APACHE II score ≥17.5 plus UA concentration ≥296.27 µmol/L were independently predictive of 30-day mortality (adjusted Model 1: hazard ratio [HR]=9.30, P=0.001; adjusted Model 2: HR=5.01, P=0.019). APACHE II score plus UA concentration was a strong independent predictor of short-term clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. A higher APACHE II score plus higher UA concentration was significantly associated with adverse short-term outcomes.",

However, there are relatively few studies on their genetic differences, especially regarding the taxonomy and geographical evolutionary history of New World species. Here, we conducted comparative, phylogenetic, and evolution analysis between one New World and five Old World Lupinus species based on their complete chloroplast genomes. Compared with the Old World species, the chloroplast genome of L. westianus in the New World was more variable, showing the deletion of the pseudogene ycf1 and two rps12 gene introns, the 20 kb inversion, the higher number of repeated sequences, the larger genome size, and the lower GC content. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the genetic relationship between the New World species L. westianus and the Old World species L. albus was closer than to the rest. Evolutionary analysis confirmed that the matK and ycf1 genes were under positive selection, and rpoA, accD, and rpoC2 genes have site-specific selection in L. westianus, which might be related to adaptive evolution. Therefore, our finding would provide genetic information for the evolutionary history and taxonomy of Lupinus species.",

To explore the mechanisms of Aβ-induced neurodegeneration, we used Aβ-treated primary cortical neuron culture as a cell model of AD and investigated the function of miR-137 in this process. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to examine levels of miR-137, AMPA receptors (AMPARs), p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2. MTT assay and caspases 3 activity assay were employed to examine cell viability and apoptosis. Dual-luciferase assay was used to validate the interaction between miR-137 and ERK1/2. We found that Aβ decreased cell viability, AMPAR and miR-137 levels, but increased caspase 3 activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-137 suppressed the Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. MiR-137 directly bound to ERK1/2 mRNA and negatively regulated its expression. Further, overexpression of ERK1/2 blocked the effects of miR-137 mimics on Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. These results provide strong evidence that miR-137 protects neurons against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity via targeting ERK1/2.",

We analyzed the diversity of culturable fungi in the gut of E. sinensis collected from a rice-crab co-culture system in Tianjin, China. We isolated 41 fungal strains from the gut of analyzed male and female crabs, using the dilution plate method. Morphological and molecular identification based on nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing suggested that these isolates belonged to 16 genera in Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mucoromycota. Aspergillus was the dominant identified genus followed by Penicillium and Talaromyces. Yeasts, including Candida, Clavispora, Meyerozyma, and Trichosporon genera, accounted for a significant portion (12.2%) of the isolated strains. Statistical analysis showed significant differences in gut-associated fungal communities between female and male crabs, with female individuals showing a higher species diversity. Our study represents the first report on intestinal fungal communities of Chinese mitten crab, providing valuable microbiological information that could be essential for supporting the effective management and conservation of this crab species, and for the improvement of the economic performance of the crab industry.",

Cisplatin (CP) is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for treating various cancers and tumors, but the use is widely curtailed due to its toxicity of various organs including the kidney. This study was aimed at investigating the protective effect of HEA on cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Mice were pretreated with HEA for 7 days and administered with cisplatin. Kidney function index including blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, renal oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory indices such as malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured. Histopathological assessment of the kidney was also performed. The results indicated that HEA noticeably modulated the levels of BUN and creatinine as well as decreased the expression of MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in the kidney. In addition, HEA up regulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and GSH-Px. Therefore, we concluded that HEA could effectively alleviate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by counteracting oxidative stress and inflammation.",

The manifestation of reduced bone strength leads to increased risk of bone fracture. Currently, many have sought for plant-based supplements for the management of bone health. Red clover (Trifolium pratense) contains phytoestrogenic isoflavones which are known to limit osteoclastic activity and reduce bone resorption. Our study aimed to optimize the condition for the preparation of red clover ethanolic extract to obtain highest yield while retaining the desired bioactivity. In this study, relative aggregated metric (RAM) was designed to ease the selection process of extraction formulation based on yield and SaOS-2 cell viability. The selected ethanolic red clover extract obtained from the optimum condition (RC-D) exerted high cell viability in SaOS-2 cells which is comparable to that of 17β-estradiol. RC-D also showed promising dose-dependent alkaline phosphatase activity in SaOS-2 cells. Besides, the RANKL, OPG, ALP and Col-A gene expression analysis revealed that RC-D potentially halts the osteoclastic activity via downregulation of RANKL mRNA expression. In short, RC-D prepared and selected via RAM developed in this study has shown promising anti-osteoporotic characteristics in SaOS-2 cells and might be considered as a functional food for bone quality management.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia homeostasis is essential for the normal functioning of macro-and microorganisms. The change in concentration of ammonia derivatives in intracellular and extracellular environments is a marker of nitrogen metabolism imbalance. Transport of these molecules is now known to occur by both simple diffusion and special membrane-associated transporters belonging to the Amt/MEP/Rh family. This protein family is subdivided into two subfamilies: the ammonium transporter (AMT)-methylammonium/ammonium permeases (MEP) and the rhesus (Rh) proteins. In this review, we systemize and generalize the long-established and some recent findings on the role of these proteins in nitrogen metabolism in general, and in the ammonia balance in particular. The similarities and differences of these systems in various living beings are discussed. The paper also focuses on the characteristics of several aspects of the classification and on the physiological importance of these proteins and their relationships to certain pathological processes. We also enumerate the prospects and unique challenges of research in this field of science. Deeper theoretical and practical research will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the structural-functional evolution of ammonia transport proteins, as well as the level of their involvement in the signaling pathways associated with the pathophysiology of nitrogen metabolism.",

High expression of VEGF (58.18%) was noticed in OSCC cases and inflammatory lesion did not show any expression. The expression pattern of VEGF increased with increasing the grade of tumour and difference in expression pattern among grades was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Moreover, VEGF protein expression was associated with stages of the cancer). The positive rate of apoptosis was 70.9%. The percentage of apoptotic cells varied from 0.3% to 20.3% and the median was 9.5.

This study was aimed at investigating the non-oxidative effect of the flavonoid-rich fraction of Lasianthera africana leaves (LAFRF) on human haemoglobin. Isolation and purification of LAFRF was carried out by solvent extraction, partitioning and ion-exchange chromatography. Six test groups were setup as follows: A reaction tube containing 800 µl of oxyhaemoglobin (OxyHb) served as the normal control, while the test groups were made up of different concentrations of LAFRF (5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/ml) incubated with 100 µl of OxyHb. The non-oxidative effects of the LAFRF on the human haemoglobin was assessed by UV-visible spectroscopy. The results indicated that LAFRF possess non-oxidative effects on human haemoglobin, as it did not cause any disappearance of the absorbance maxima at 576 nm and 541 nm at all concentrations investigated. Furthermore, a concentration-dependent increase in the absorbance of the treated OxyHb was recorded when compared to the untreated OxyHb, thus signifying its potential as a safe pharmacological agent for in vivo investigations.",

    "abstract": "All parts of Phyllanthus emblica L. are traditionally used for the treatment of jaundice, inflammation, and diarrhea. The present study was planned to evaluate the P. emblica leaf extract (PELE) assisted clearance of bilirubin in artificially-induced hyperbilirubinemic rabbits. Hyperbilirubinemia was induced in White New Zealand albino rabbits by oral administration of phenyl hydrazine solution (10 mg kg−1 body weight) and an intraperitoneal injection of ursodeoxycholic acid solution (10 mg kg−1 bw). PELE-assisted bilirubin clearance from animals was optimized by a bi-factorial response-surface central composite design with five levels of each of the extract dose (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg kg−1 bw) and sampling period (24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h). The oral administration of PELE showed a significant (p < 0.05) dose-dependent linear increase in bilirubin clearance from hyperbilirubinemic rabbits. However, the sampling period showed no significant effect on bilirubin clearance. The optimum levels of PELE dose and sampling period for maximum clearance of bilirubin (0.658 mg dL−1) were found to be 94.864 mg kg−1 body weight and 51.12 h respectively. PELE was found to be effective in bilirubin clearance at the observed optimum levels of extract dose and would be a good choice for the management of hyperbilirubinemia.",

Hence, immunotherapy has become a worthwhile therapy for KIRC. Furthermore, tumor mutation burden (TMB) has been regarded as the most prevalent biomarker to predict immunotherapy response. Accordingly, we spent the effort to characterize the status and the predictive potential for immunotherapy response of gene mutations in KIRC. In this study, we identified common somatic mutations in KIRC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and UTokyo cohorts in cBioportal database. BRCA1-related protein 1 (BAP1) was identified as the only common gene mutation related to TMB and overall survival. We finally explored whether mutation of BAP1 was related to immune response and immune infiltration. In brief, we identified and demonstrated that BAP1 mutations commonly occurred in KIRC patients, associated with lower TMB, and indicating a poorer prognosis. Furthermore, BAP1 mutation reversed its function as a tumor suppressor via influencing Mast cells' quantity. These findings cast light on the predictive value of BAP1 to evaluate immunotherapeutic sensitivity and presented a potential target for KIRC treatment.",

Twelve patients (with ALL, AML, CML, biphenotypic leukemia and aplastic anemia) were enrolled in a stool samples collection protocol before the start of HSCT and during a 30-day post-transplant period. We have shown the feasibility of a gut microbiome monitoring in a real-life clinical setting and have proven that the alpha-biodiversity of the microbiome is significantly reduced with HSCT in comparison with the individual patient baseline level (Xdc 72.93; p < 0.001; multivariate Dirichlet analysis), what may be related to the antibiotic use and conditioning regimen. Overall, the gut microbiome biodiversity monitoring may be clinically used in a real-life HSCT setting to identify the high-risk groups for developing bloodstream infections and transplant-related negative outcomes.",

Cardiac dysfunction is a non-negligible component of multiple organ dysfunction in sepsis. However, the specific mechanism of septic cardiomyopathy remains unclear. The results showed that in septic cardiomyopathy, there was damage to cardiomyocytes, while cell death was rare. A growing body of research has shown that mitochondria play an essential role in organ damage in sepsis. The severity of mitochondrial dysfunction is closely related to the prognosis of sepsis and cardiac dysfunction. To date, the mechanisms involved in mitochondrial dysfunction in septic cardiomyopathy include mitochondrial oxidative stress, Ca2+ overload, inflammatory pathways, energy deficiency, and mitochondrial dynamics. It is evident that damaged mitochondria in cardiomyocytes can be fatal to the heart. However, the exact molecular mechanism and its potential significance are still not fully understood. Here, this review intends to draw conclusions about the mechanisms associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in septic cardiomyopathy and to delve into the mechanisms involved in order to find new insights into the study of septic cardiomyopathy.",

Soil bulk density and pH increased with increasing sampling depth, while electrical conductivity and soil organic carbon declined with depth. Results from this study indicated a reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity with time. The highest grain yield was found in the T4 and T3. In contrast, the highest grain yield was observed under F4 and F5 fertilization treatments at location 1 and F5 and F4 treatments at location 2. There were significant differences in growth characteristics and yield components due to the influence of tillage practices and fertilization levels in both experiment locations.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. The primary pathological mechanism in myocardial infarction and heart failure is irreversible cardiomyocyte loss. The conventional knowledge is that mammals have a transient cardiac regenerative potential shortly after birth, but adult cardiomyocytes, as terminally differentiated cells, cannot regenerate. In contrast, some lower vertebrates, such as zebrafish, regenerate cardiac muscle throughout their lifetime. Zebrafish are extremely sensitive to cardiac injury and, within a short period, stimulate the proliferation of cardiomyocytes in numbers that fully regenerate to pre-injury levels; meanwhile, the initial scarring is gradually absorbed until there is little or no visible sign of fibrosis in the regenerating myocardium. The newborn mouse heart has the same remarkable regenerative potential before birth as one week after cardiac injury. The complex process of regeneration restores tissue structure through a series of cascade events, a coordinated process of cell proliferation, differentiation and dedifferentiation, and rearrangement of tissue morphogenesis. Understanding the ontogeny and development of cardiac regeneration and the molecular mechanisms of cardiac regeneration in zebrafish and mice is the cornerstone of regenerative biology and provides clues to investigate the cardiac repair process in adult mammals, resulting in extensive scarring rather than cardiomyocyte regeneration.",

Early diagnosis of ameloblastoma and formulating an appropriate treatment plan play a crucial role in reducing the postoperative recurrence rate.

This review summarises the diagnostic techniques used for the detection of ameloblastoma and the methods for differentiating it from other benign odontogenic tumours to aid in the clinical diagnosis. A comprehensive review was conducted by searching the database of PubMed for studies published up to May 2023. Panoramic radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have been used to detect ameloblastoma, whereas fine-needle aspiration cytology and biopsies have been used to enhance diagnostic precision and clinical diagnosis. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and FDG positron emission tomography(PET) have been used to detect metastasis of ameloblastoma to determine the prognosis of the disease. Laboratory tests are more suitable for detecting genetic alterations and identifying certain markers. Different diagnostic techniques aid in differentiating ameloblastoma from other odontogenic diseases. Combining these techniques may increase the diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected ameloblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It is characterized by a high incidence, high mortality rate, and poor prognosis. With the increasing consumption of antibiotics and the growing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, clinicians are in greater need of easily accessible and effective inflammatory markers to monitor the infection process, guide treatment, and assess patient prognosis. Numerous biomarkers have been studied for their potential value in the diagnosis of sepsis, and more than 250 different biomarkers have been proposed. However, many of these biomarkers are more useful for prognostic evaluation than for diagnosis. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein have been extensively studied, with procalcitonin being the only sepsis biomarker included in clinical guidelines. It can be used to guide antibiotic use but should not be used as a standalone diagnostic indicator. C-reactive protein has poor sensitivity and specificity for sepsis diagnosis. In recent years, new biomarkers, such as neutrophil extracellular traps, interleukin-6, histones, cell-free DNA and composite indicators, such as the systemic immune inflammation index,have been identified. This article provides a comprehensive review of the diagnostic value of traditional and recently popular novel biomarkers for sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of color vision deficiency (CVD) and create awareness about the burden of CVD among drivers. Methodology: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of 3486 participants (men, n = 2789) who applied for/renewed their drivers' licenses in Al Ain City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE). All drivers had their visual acuity (VA) and color vision measured using standard procedures and the data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The overall prevalence of CVD was 3.13% (95% CI: 2.59–3.75). No participants had visual impairment (best-corrected distance VA worse than 6/18) and no female driver had CVD. The prevalence of CVD among the male drivers was 3.91% (95% CI: 3.25–4.69), and more among the younger drivers (18–29 years). Conclusion: Although the prevalence of CVD was low, to ensure inclusivity and the safety of all road users in the UAE, it is recommended that traffic lights and road signs that mainly use connotative color coding be adapted to include denotative clues which can be interpreted by drivers with CVD. A prospective study in all approved eye testing centers for drivers should be conducted to obtain representative CVD data of drivers in the UAE.",

    "abstract": "Ketosis is a prevalent metabolic disease in the peripartum period of dairy cows, that causes considerable losses in milk production. In particular, the changes in the gut microbiome influence the occurrence of cow ketosis. In this study, the hindgut microbial communities of ketotic and healthy cows were compared and analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Community composition analysis reveal that the predominant phyl in both groups were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. At the genus level, Bifidobacterium were more abundant in healthy cows than in ketotic cows. Conversely, the ketotic group exhibited a greater abundance of Bacteroides and Treponema than the healthy group. Differential hindgut fecal bacterial taxa in healthy and ketotic cows were identified by linear discriminant analysis effect size, with increases in Treponema, Bacteroides, and Peptococcaceae and decreases in Christensenellales, Chloroflexi, and Paenibacillaceae in ketotic cows. A distance-based redundancy analysis was conducted to further explore the connection between the gut microbiome, blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and milk production traits. The results suggested that the hindgut microflora was significantly correlated with blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentration and somatic cell score. These results improve our understanding of rectal microbes, and may help prevent ketosis in cows.",

This study investigates the bioactivity of the methanolic extract of Hypotrachyna cirrhata through in vitro and in silico approaches. The ethyl acetate fraction demonstrated the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity, with an IC50 of 10.37 ± 0.62 μg/mL, while the methanolic extract exhibited an IC50 of 72.30 ± 0.55 μg/mL. For α-glucosidase inhibition, the ethyl acetate fraction and crude extract showed IC50 values of 1.17 ± 0.50 μg/mL and 5.00 ± 0.45 μg/mL, respectively. Antibacterial assays revealed zones of inhibition of 12 and 11 mm against Staphylococcus aureus at 25 mg/mL, with the strain showing sensitivity to the methanolic extract (MIC of 20.0 × 10−4 mg/mL). LC-MS analysis identified eight metabolites in the ethyl acetate extract, salazinic acid (1), roccellaric acid (2), constictic acid (3), protolichesterinic acid (4), mannitol (5), penta hydroxyicosatrienoicacid (6), methyl pentahydroxyoxoheptacosanoate (7), and one unknown compound. Five major compounds (1-5) were selected for computational analysis and highlighted that salazinic acid as a potential lead compound, displaying a non-competitive binding with α-glucosidase and a binding affinity of −9.9 kcal/mol. These findings suggest salazinic acid's promise as an α-glucosidase inhibitor.",

Porphyromonas gingivalis is a commensal bacterium that induces periodontal pyroptosis. The transcription factor Dec1 can regulate the expression of inflammatory molecules. In this study, we investigated whether a deficiency of Dec1 activates/represses Caspase-1 and/or Gasdermin-D in periodontal pyroptosis, resulting in the release of the proinflammatory mediator interleukin-1β. Dec1 expression in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPDLFs) treated with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was assessed and pyroptosis activation was determined by microscopy, qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Moreover, a siRNA targeting Dec1 was introduced into HPDLFs to determine the function of Dec1 in periodontal pyroptosis and a Dec1-deficient experimental mouse model of periodontitis was used. Treatment of HPDLFs with P. gingivalis LPS-stimulated levels of cleaved-Caspase-1 and cleaved-GSDMD and increased levels of phosphorylated NF-κB and interleukin-1β. In contrast, Dec1 knockdown maintained cellular homeostasis with low levels of pyroptosis. Treatment with P. gingivalis alleviated periodontal pyroptosis in PDLFs of wild-type mice and a Dec1 deficiency subsequently repressed the inflammatory effect of P. gingivalis. These results reveal for the first time the novel function of Dec1 in periodontal pyroptosis, suggesting that Dec1 is a crucial target to prevent periodontal inflammation.",

The present study was designed to investigate the effects of aloperine against human liver cancer cells and to explore the underlying mechanism. The results showed significant (P < .05) upregulation of GROα (GRO1 oncogene) in liver cancer tissues and cell lines. However, the expression of GROα significantly (P < .05) declined in liver cancer cells treated with aloperine (5 µM) which was concomitant with the inhibition of proliferation. Silencing of GROα significantly (P < .05) inhibited the proliferation of the liver cancer via G2/M cycle arrest. Interestingly, aloperine also triggered G2/M cell cycle arrest of the liver cancer cells. Nonetheless, the growth inhibitory effects of aloperine on liver cancer cells were attenuated by GROα overexpression and the cancer cells did not show the arrest of cell division. Additionally, aloperine also suppressed the migration, invasion and epithelial to mesenchymal transition of the human liver cancer cells via inhibition of GROα expression. Collectively, the findings revealed growth inhibitory effects of aloperine via suppression of GROα expression and point toward its therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is a defense mechanism that the immune system uses in response to harmful stimuli such as pathogens, damaged cells, toxic compounds, or irradiation. These stimuli may induce inflammatory response and potentially tissue damage in respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, nervous, endocrine, urinary, or reproductive systems. Inflammatory diseases include a broad array of disorders and conditions that are characterized by inflammation, ranging from autoimmune disease, atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, hepatitis, reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, diabetes, cancer, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, to depression. Epigenetic mechanisms play crucial roles in many biological processes by regulating transcriptional activation or repression. Histone post-translational modifications have emerged as prospective therapeutic targets. Methylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 is one of the most highly conserved epigenetic marks that correlate well with gene silencing. The methylation status of H3K9 modulates immune cell differentiation and immune responses and therefore influences the outcome of cancer, infection, and other inflammatory diseases. Here, we review the high impact and innovate discoveries in this field, highlight the critical role of the H3K9 methylation/de-methylation in human inflammatory diseases, discuss potential new therapeutic strategies based on a better understanding of the biology of H3K9 methylation modifications.Abbreviations: 2OG: 2-oxoglutarate; AOL: Amine oxidase-like; ChIP: Chromatin immunoprecipitation; CNS2: conserved noncoding sequence 2; COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CoREST: Corepressor of RE1 silencing transcription factor; CPP: Cell-permeant protein; CTLA4: Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4; DCs: Dendritic cells; DN: Diabetic nephropathy; ESRD: End-stage renal disease; ETDB: SET domain bifurcated histone lysine methyltransferase; FAD: Flavin adenine dinucleotide; FEV1%: The percentage of forced expiratory volume in one second; FEV1/FVC: Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/Forced vital capacity (FVC) value; FOXP3: forkhead/winged helix transcription factor 3; GLP: G9a like protein; GZMB: Granzyme B; H3K27me3: Trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3; H3K4me3: Trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3; H3K9: Histone 3 Lysine 9; HG: Hyperglycemia; HDAC3: Histone deacetylase 3; HP1: Heterochromatin protein 1; I/R: Ischemia/Reperfusion; IBD: Inflammatory bowel disease; IFN-: Interferon-; IFNG: Interferon Gamma; IL-2: Interleukin-2; ILC2s: Group 2 innate lymphoid cells; JMJD: Jumonji domain-containing protein; iTreg: inducible Treg; KDM: Lysine-specific demethylase; LPS: Lipopolysaccharide; LSD: Lys-specific demethylase; MCP-1: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MCSF: Macrophage colony-stimulating factor; MIP-1: Macrophage inflammatory protein-1; MS: Metabolic syndrome; NAFLD: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NKRF: NF-kappaB repressing factor; NOR: Norisoboldine; NuRD: Nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase; OxLDL: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein; PBMCs: Peripheral blood monocytes; PHD: Plant homology domain; Poly I:C: Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid; PPARγ: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; PTMs: Post-translational modifications; SUV3-9: Suppressor of variegation3-9; T1D: Type 1 diabetes; TLRs: Toll like receptors; TSDR: TGF-β sensitive region and Treg cell specific demethylated region; Treg: Regulatory T cell; VSMCs: Vascular smooth muscle cells.",

However, acetyl xylan esterases from natural microorganisms have low expression and low enzyme activity and are impure. In this study, a new xylanase gene, est1051, from the metagenomic library, was expressed in the prokaryotic system. Its enzymatic properties were explored, including optimum temperature and pH, thermal and pH stability, and tolerance against organic solvents, metal ions and salt solutions. Then the fermentation conditions of EST1051 were optimized by the response surface method, and the maximum enzyme yield reached 1909.32 U/L. Finally, the synergism with cellulase on straw degradation was evaluated. EST1051 displays high homology with acetylxylan esterases in terms of amino acid sequences and conserved active sites. EST1051 shows high stability across a broad temperature range, and retains more than 60% of its enzymatic activity between 4 and 60°C after 24 h of incubation. Single-factor analysis and orthogonal design were conducted to determine the optimal conditions for the maximizing the saccharification rate of wheat straws. Interestingly, the synergism of EST1051 with cellulase contributes to the efficient transformation of wheat straws. These findings may open the door to significant industrial applications of this novel acetylxylan esterase.",

Such theoretical methods are not only valuable in the design of promoters with specified strength but are also meaningful in understanding the mechanistic role of promoters in transcriptional regulation. In this study, we present a theoretical model to describe the relationship between promoter strength and nucleotide sequence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The study investigated factors associated with serum sIL-2R concentrations in adults.Methods: Serum sIL-2R concentrations were measured in 1499 randomly selected individuals (44.6% male, median age 52 years, range 18–91 years). Lifestyle factors (alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical activity) were assessed by questionnaire. Body mass index and data defining metabolic syndrome were measured in all participants. Atopy was defined by skin tests to aeroallergens.Results: Serum sIL-2R concentrations displayed wide variation (2.5–97.5 percentile range, 209–950 U/mL). A total of 230 (15.3%) individuals showed values higher than the standard reference range (158–623 U/mL). After adjusting for covariates, sIL-2R concentrations increased with age, particularly after 65 years. Serum sIL-2R concentrations were higher in males than in females, were higher in smokers than in never smokers, and were higher in atopic than in non-atopic individuals. Serum sIL-2R concentrations were positively associated with metabolic syndrome, particularly with abdominal obesity, and with a history of ischemic heart disease. Light alcohol drinkers showed lower sIL-2R concentrations than abstainers.Conclusion: Aging, sex, lifestyle factors, atopy, metabolic abnormalities, and ischemic heart disease might influence serum sIL-2R concentrations in adults.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms involved in the coupling between cardiac and locomotor rhythms in patients with heart disease remain unclear. It was speculated that reduced function of the cardiovascular and/or locomotor systems would increase the coupling of these systems to increase energy efficiency in response to increased energy demand during exercise. We investigated the development of cardiolocomotor coupling (CLC) in patients with coronary artery disease. Eight outpatients with coronary artery disease (CAD group) and eight healthy individuals (control group) underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing involving a cycle ergometer ramp protocol and treadmill walk test to record CLC strength. The coefficient of determination (R2 value) of the interval between R waves on the electrocardiograph and step interval reflects CLC strength intensity. The Student's t-test was used to compare cardiopulmonary exercise testing data and R2 values between the study groups. The R2 value was significantly higher in the CAD group than the control group. Peak oxygen uptake and oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold were significantly lower in the CAD group than the control group. Our findings showed that CLC intensity was higher in patients with CAD, suggesting that CLC is more likely to occur in individuals with reduced exercise tolerance due to cardiorespiratory deterioration.Key highlights Eight outpatients with coronary artery disease and eight healthy individuals underwent cardiopulmonary exercise and treadmill walk tests to determine cardiolocomotor coupling strength and physiological characteristics.This study reports a stronger cardiolocomotor coupling during exercise in patients with coronary artery disease compared with healthy individuals, suggesting that cardiolocomotor coupling is more likely to occur in people with reduced exercise tolerance attributed to impaired cardiorespiratory function.Our results support the theory that patients with cardiorespiratory impairment due to coronary artery disease have greater dynamic interaction between the locomotor and cardiovascular systems during exercise, which is concurrent with the hypothesis that cardiolocomotor coupling is a compensatory phenomenon for exercise maintenance.",

The results from the analyses confirmed the hypothesis formulated by the authors for possible presence of undeclared steroid ingredients in food supplements, and enabled the following conclusion: more than half of the tested food supplements contained undeclared anabolic steroids, all banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, and their number in one of the samples could be more than one. The authors also revealed that the information on the product label and package concealed the undeclared ingredients of the food supplement and claimed for high efficacy and safety.",

    "abstract": "Plant-derived natural compounds are desired for their anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated the chemical composition and the anti-inflammatory effects of the essential oil obtained from leaves of the Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua L. Artemisia annua L. essential oil (AO) was obtained by hydrodistillation; the extraction yield was approximately 1.2%. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) revealed the presence of 13 compounds in AO; the major compounds were caryophyllene (32.16%), eucalyptol (28.62%), α-pinene (19.08%), and β-pinene (14.72%). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay revealed that AO did not show in vitro cytotoxicity toward RAW264.7 cells and suppressed the expression of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. Pretreatment with AO significantly reduced xylene-induced inflammation in the ears of Kunming mice. AO inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased epidermis thickness in the ear, and suppressed expression of TNF-α in the serum. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of AO was similar to that of the positive control compound Di Song Zhang Bo Cream. Overall, AO was observed to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent. These results provide an experimental basis for commercializing AO-derived external preparations for pharmacological and cosmetic industries.",

Western blot and quantitative RT–PCR were used to measure the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes. The DCFH-DA fluorescence probe assay was performed to assess the intracellular levels in HUVECs and LMVECs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to assess the DNA binding activities of Nrf2. Better survival, reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines, and improved pathological infiltration in the lungs and kidneys were observed in septic rats treated with sevoflurane. SOD activity increased and Nrf2–ARE signaling pathway was activated following sevoflurane treatment. The protective effect was lost in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) following inhibition of Nrf2 by intratracheal delivery of siRNA-Nrf2. In vitro experiments, we found the sevoflurane could suppress ROS production after stimulation with LPS and the application of sevoflurane augments the DNA-binding activity of Nrf2 in HUVECs and LMVECs. However, knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA-Nrf2, the Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, and the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 could partially recover ROS production, inhibit the activity of SOD, and repress the expression of anti-oxidant genes following sevoflurane treatment. Sevoflurane could have protective effects in ALI and septic multiple organ disorders (MODs).",

Life, information, and consciousness are identified as a unique set of biological phenomena that are common to only and all living beings. These three distinct phenomena always occur together in a whole pattern, and matter is viewed as the carrier of these phenomena. We explore the unique characteristics of life, information, and consciousness, and their relationships to one another. The experiences and behaviors of human beings, our present-day knowledge of biology, and some organisms’ simple behaviors that we can observe are used to understand these biological phenomena. A distinction between genetic information and non-genetic information is also made, and their importance to life is emphasized. The interactions of biological activities between living beings and their environments are explained in the context of improving their chance of survival. Additionally, consciousness is simplified and exemplified via five categories from a hierarchical perspective, and various types of death are discussed.",

In this study, metabolome analysis based on GC and LC/MS/MS was carried out to assess the metabolic profile of both DOPs and Mat. Transcriptome analysis was used to reveal internal relationships between metabolites and the differing gene regulation. The results indicated that although DOPs and Mat had a similar chemical composition, they exhibited different patterns of content. GO classification and KEGG clustering of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DOPs and Mat demonstrated that gene enrichment was mainly related to flavonoid biosynthetic and metabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and polysaccharide catabolic processes. An alteration in gene expression related to specific metabolic pathways offered a probable explanation for the observed differences in metabolites between DOPs and Mat. This work provides a foundation for subsequent studies regarding the biosynthetic pathways of related metabolites from D. officinalis.",

In this study, a comparative study on the volatile profiles of palm kernel expeller (PKE) and palm kernel meal (PKM) was performed using GC-MS coupled with dynamic headspace (DHS) sampling techniques. Our aim is to understand the contribution of geographical origin, processing technology and moisture content to the volatile profiles of PKE and PKM by analysing a total of 56 samples using GC-MS-DHS. Using data analytics, we have obtained a 'volatile fingerprint' of PKE and PKM sourced from different processing plants. We have also gained insight into the potential odour-active compounds in palm kernel cakes of different processes. These results provide scientific basis for the development of more palatable and economical animal feed involving palm kernel cake.",

We introduce a new application for a semiautomated robotic, computed tomography (CT)-guided needle placement for postmortem lumbar and suboccipital CSF sampling. Postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) imaging was performed, and the data were sent to a custom-made Virtopsy Control Center and Virtopsy Planning and Navigation Station. Needle trajectories were planned for both suboccipital and lumbar approaches. Coaxial introducer needles were fully inserted automatically by the robotic system. PMCT was repeated to verify correct placement of the needles. Subsequently, CSF samples were taken using a syringe. By using this new application, the puncture of the spinal canal and cerebellomedullary cistern could be accurately performed to within a millimeter. Thus, failure of puncture and iatrogenic injury of the medulla oblongata may be prevented, and the risk of infection is significantly reduced. An early analysis of the CSF sample allows for a risk assessment in regard to the subsequent autopsy. Our application allows for minimally invasive, fast, efficient and safe CSF sampling prior to autopsy, enabling an analysis for metabolic imbalance, infection, etc.",

Reliable animal models to evaluate therapeutic options are urgently required, however, some of the most established ones are technically challenging. We herein present a murine model of abdominal sepsis based on the intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a defined inoculum of stool specimens (IPSI). Fecal bacterial compositions of male C57BL/6N mice were used for experiments. Dilutions of suspended stool (1:3, 1:6, 1:9) were injected i.p. into recipient mice. Clinical symptoms, cytokine expression, and mortality were assessed up to 48 h following IPSI. Storage at 4°C for 72 h exerted only minimal effect on bacterial composition, while deep freezing substantially impacted bacterial viability. After 9 h following IPSI, a dose-dependent, significant increase in clinical score was visible in all stool-injected mice. The same was observed for expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CCL-2. Mortality rate of septic mice ranged from ∼30% (1:9) to 100% (1:3) within 48 h, depended on the dilution of stool inoculum. The IPSI model ensures experimental stability while mimicking a pathophysiological relevant stimulus similar to other established models. Characterization of microbial composition, minimal invasiveness and easy technical handling allow a good reproducibility and disease severity can be titrated.",

Although abundant researches have focused on identification the key genes associated with flavonoids biosynthesis in purple-leaf tea cultivars, However, the accumulation pattern of flavonoids in purple-leaf tea is still worth investigation. Here, a group of local purple-leaf tea varieties ('Baitangziyacha', BTZY), which are derived from the natural mutant of green-leaf tea varieties ('Baitangshancha', BTSC), were found in China. To evaluate the available value of purple-leaf tea varieties, 11 'BTZY' and 9 'BTSC' varieties were used to analyze the accumulation of flavonoids by widely targeted metabolomic analyses. The results showed that 259 secondary metabolites were characterized, of which 250 metabolites were flavonoids. Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis indicated 'BTZY' and 'BTSC' varieties were not completely classified may be due to differences in the accumulation of a few metabolites. Furthermore, these results found that 6 types of anthocyanins 5 types of flavonols were significantly up-regulated in purple-leaf varieties. These metabolites potentially contributed to the unique color and flavor of purple-leaf tea. Our findings will be useful for the further breeding and processing of local purple-leaf tea varieties.",

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of OA remain unclear. Therefore, uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying OA progression is crucial for the development of OA therapy. Of note, for the last 6 years (especially in 2020 and 2021), increasing numbers of studies have suggested that aberrantly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the pathogenesis of OA. Until now, circRNAs have been attracting high attention as microRNA (miRNA) sponges that sequester miRNAs from their endogenous targets, meanwhile alternative functions of circRNAs have been also suggested. Moreover, it has been reported that circulating or tissue-specific circRNAs can be used for diagnosing different types of human diseases, including cancers, neurological diseases, and inflammatory diseases. Given the putative involvement of circRNAs in the pathogenesis of OA, it looks promising that some of the dysregulated circRNAs may have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets and/or diagnostic biomarkers for OA. This review summarizes the current progress on dysregulated circRNAs and their pathological implications in knee OA, which may provide a direction for revealing their therapeutic potential in OA.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most fatal of all primary human brain tumors, with a 14-month median survival. The mainstay therapy for this tumor involves temozolomide, surgery, radiotherapy, and tumor-treating electric field. Cancer resistance to commonly available chemotherapeutics remains a major challenge in glioblastoma patients receiving treatment and unfavorably impacts their overall survival and outcome. However, the lack of progress in this area could be attributed to the lack of tools to probe unbiasedly at the genome-wide level the coding and non-coding elements’ contribution on a large scale for factors that control resistance to chemotherapeutics. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapeutics will enable precision medicine in the treatment of cancer patients. CRISPR Cas9a has emerged as a functional genomics tool to study at the genome level the factors that control cancer resistance to drugs. Recently, we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9a screen to identify genes responsible for glioblastoma susceptibility to etoposide. We extended our inquiry to understanding genes that control glioblastoma response to temozolomide using the genome-scale CRISPR. This study shows that the unbiased genome-wide loss of function approach can be applied to discover genes that influence tumor resistance to chemotherapeutics and contribute to chemoresistance in glioblastoma.",

The purpose of this experiment is to explore the function of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 01106 (LINC01106) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LINC01106 expression in NSCLC was determined by RT-qPCR. Next, the distribution of LINC01106 in A549 cells was observed using subcellular fractionation. Subsequently, functional assays were performed to access NSCLC cell biological behaviors, with epithelial–mesenchymal transition detected by the western blot analysis. After that xenograft tumors were established in nude mice to analyze the inhibitory role of LINC01106 knockdown in NSCLC. In addition, gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays were carried out to confirm the interaction between LINC01106 and microRNA (miR)-765 and between miR-765 and collagen type III (COL3A1) in NSCLC cells.

    "abstract": "Autophagy process coordinates lysosomal destruction of cytoplasmic materials including damaged organelles and proteins. The double-membranous 'autophagosome' selectively sequesters the cytosolic components, followed by 'autolysosome' formation for degradation. By recycling energy, autophagy preserves intracellular homeostasis. Autophagy also acts a crucial function in various cellular events including cell survival and death in response to stressed conditions. Thus, any dysfunction in autophagy causes a wide variety of pathologies including cancers. Multiple lines of evidence have decorated the importance of autophagy for the regulation of cancer development. Aberrant autophagy can govern healthy normal cells to endure the transformation of malignant cells. By comparison, cancer cells are apt to control autophagy to bloom it and to repel therapeutic challenges. Hence, the modulation of autolysosomes can assassinate malignant cells or sharpen them for therapy. Most current research is trying to manipulate autophagy appropriately for cancer therapies and a wide variety of medical objectives are turning forward to inhibit the acidification of lysosomes and autolysosomes with repurposing drugs. This review explores the lysosomotropic agents be utilized to treat cancers through their inhibiting roles in the acidification system and discuss the preclinical and clinical clues for hints the next generation of pharmacological agents for the treatment of cancers.",

Rats were divided as follows: Group I, control rats administered normal saline solution; Group II, diabetic rats; Group III, diabetic rats treated with metformin; Group IV, diabetic rats administered fenretinide; and Group V, diabetic rats administered both metformin and fenretinide.Results: Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was increased in diabetic rats compared to control rats (p<0.05). However, both FBG and glycated hemoglobin levels were decreased (p<0.05) in diabetic rats treated with fenretinide and metformin compared to diabetic untreated rats. A positive relationship was identified between RBP4 level and insulin resistance. Further, diabetic rats treated with fenretinide and metformin had decreased RBP4 levels. Conversely, GLUT4 mRNA was markedly increased (p<0.05) in diabetic rats administered fenretinide and metformin, thereby improving insulin sensitivity. TNF-α level showed a direct relationship with the insulin resistance. Evidently, metformin and fenretinide decreased plasma IL-6 level and increased IL-10 levels.Conclusion: Metformin and fenretinide exhibit individual and synergistic effects when administered to treat diabetes in a rat model.Abbreviations: RBP4: Retinol-binding protein 4; IL: Interleukin; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-alpha; STZ: Streptozotocin; NaF: sodium fluoride; cDNA: complementary DNA; ACTB: beta-actin; GLUT4: glucose transporter type 4; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; VLDL: very-low-density lipoprotein; TAG: triacylglycerol; HDL: high-density lipoprotein; FBG: fasting blood glucose; DIO: diet-induced obese; IR: insulin receptor; TG: triglyceride",

Fifty healthy people who came to our hospital for physical examination at the same time served as the control group (CG). Serum HMGB1, CD4+, and CD8+ expression levels and CD4+/CD8+ ratios were compared between the three groups. The correlation between serum HMGB1 expression, APACHE II score, and MODS score was analyzed. Serum HMGB1 and CD8+ expressions were lower in the CG group than the values in the MG and SG groups, whereas the CD4+ expression and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were higher. Serum HMGB1 expression in sepsis patients was positively correlated with the APACHEII and MODS scores. In addition, the 28-day survival rate of the MG was higher than that of the SG. HMGB1 was highly expressed in the serum of patients with sepsis. HMGB1 expression was positively associated with the severity of sepsis. In addition, HMGB1 was closely related to the immune function and prognosis of patients with sepsis.",

The molecular basis of CA pathogenesis is known, but the underlying mechanisms connecting genotype to phenotype changes in the proteins are not yet fully explored. Hence, in this study, three LQT2-linked missense mutations (Thr613Met, Ser641Phe and Gly648Ser) located in exon-7 region of KCNH2 gene identified in CA patients was assessed for their deleteriousness using diverse computational algorithms. The SIFT and PolyPhen-2 methods, which depends on sequence conservation across species, and protein structure-based information have attributed pathogenicity to these variants. Protein behavior studies at 3D level have identified that these three missense mutations induce biochemically severe amino acid changes that may alters the structure and function of KCNH2. Our molecular docking suggested that mutant KCNH2 protein shows a similar binding interactions to KB-R7943 as compared to the wild type model. These findings could be useful in resorting to alternate therapies for subset of CA patients who show limited therapeutic response to KB-R7943. This study supports that in silico approaches could act as a first-line filters to screen the potential impact of CA linked KCNH2 mutations depending upon the perspective of molecular evolution and phenotype of proteins.",

However, few studies of AHSYB on inflammation in rats with acute permanent cerebral ischemia was explored. In this study, three doses of AHSYB (1.75, 3.5, 7 mg/kg) were administered to rats. The results showed that AHSYB improved neurological deficit, reduced brain infarct volume, alleviated the brain inflammation and suppressed the elevation of both mRNA and protein levels of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).

Small molecules target dividing cells in G1/S, G2 or M phases of cells to arrest and eventually trigger cancer cells to enter apoptosis and/or inhibit tumor growth. Cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase is a widely used approach to inhibit proliferating cancer cells. We report a novel angiotensin II receptor type I (AT1R) antagonist that also targets CDC2 (CDK1) kinase thereby showing a putative anti-cancer activity. The molecule named 19D was tested in various cancer cell lines at different concentrations. Molecular mechanisms of action triggered by the treatment of 19D were investigated for anti-cancer activity at cellular and molecular level. 19D molecule showed a potent cell cycle arrest with anti-proliferation activity. Cells treated with 19D showed nuclear deteriorations and apoptotic induction on cancer cells. Moreover, the mechanism of cell cycle inhibition was revealed as G2/M arrest via suppressing the CDC2 kinase cell cycle check point inhibitor. In conclusion, 19D (an AT1R antagonist) is a novel small molecule/imidazolone derivative which has been demonstrated as a fairly potent anti-cancer molecule.Abbreviations: AT1R: angiotensin II receptor type 1; BSA: bovine serum albumine; CDC2: cyclin-dependent kinase 1; CDK: cyclin-dependent kinase; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified eagle medium; DMSO: dimethylsulfoxide; EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; FBS: fetal bovine serum; HBSS: Hank's balanced salt solution; IC50: half maximal inhibitory concentration; PBS-T: phosphate buffered saline – TritonX; PBS: phosphate buffered saline; PDB: protein data bank; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulfate; TBS-T: Tris buffered saline – TritonX",

After phenotyping the F2:3 across three environments to detect QTL for heading date. The results showed that three QTLs that play a major role in heading date were identified, cqHD2H-1 and cqHD2H-2 were identified across two environments and considered environmentally stable. The cqHD2H-2, reflects a stable early-heading locus, explaining 27.50% of the phenotypic variance. Mapping of the cqHD2H-2 was subsequently conducted in extremely heading individuals from F5 populations, the cqHD2H-2 was further delimited to a region of approximately 84 Mb on 2H, and the HORVU2Hr1G087460 gene was identified as a homologue of the rice DTH8 gene by a BLASTN analysis of the candidate region.

Functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis were performed for the DEGs. The transcription factors were predicted using TRRUST and miRWalk 3.0. Finally, Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the results of transcriptome sequencing. HT-29 had a more sensitive response to FZXJP. Transcriptome sequencing revealed 1522 DEGs, and they were enriched in various biological processes and pathways, such as regulation of cellular biosynthetic process and MAPK signaling pathway. Totally 61 proteins in the PPI network with degree > 5 were screened as hub genes, including EGR1, KLHL11, UBA7, IRF1, HERC6, and IFI35. The qRT-PCR confirmed that the expression of those genes was consistent with that of transcriptome analysis. Three transcription factors and 15 miRNAs were predicted. All the three transcription factors were found to interact with EGR1. IRF1 was a target of miR-93-5p. This study provided a theoretical basis for the regulation of FZXJP in HT-29cells, which lays a foundation for the treatment of CRC.",

    "abstract": "We proposed that autophagy activated through PPARγ in prostate cancer could protect cancer against androgen deprivation. Our MTT and western blotting assay results showed that mimics of miR-337-3p repressed autophagy flux under androgen deprivation, whereas inhibitors had the opposite effect. Neither mimics nor inhibitors influenced cell motility and invasion. miR-337-3p downregulated PPARγ expression in dual luciferase reporter assays and promoted AMPK phosphorylation. The overexpression of PPARγ or AMPK agonists partly diminished the adverse influence of mimics on proliferation and cell autophagy. In a mouse xenograft model, tumors transplanted with LNCap cells having a miR-337-3p deficiency had a significantly larger volume and lower rate of apoptosis than in controls after orchidectomy. Our findings showed that the negative effects of miR-337-3p on cell survival after androgen deprivation through PPARγ degeneration and modulated autophagy could serve as a novel therapeutic target for androgen-dependent prostate cancer and provide a strategy against resistance to anti-androgen therapy.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of TIPE2 gene-modified human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs) on immune tolerance. In this study, the TIPE2 over-expressed and the non-transfected hAD-MSCs were severally co-cultured with injured cardiomyocytes. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Cell viability was measured by MTT, and expressions of immune-related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. When compared with the empty vector-transfected hAD-MSCs, the TIPE2-overexpression hAD-MSCs co-cultured with injured cardiomyocytes show accelerated cell viability and declined apoptosis. After TIPE2 over-expression, the mRNA and protein levels of p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and interferon-γ (INF-γ) notably decreased, whereas those of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) increased in a converse trend. This study suggested that TIPE2 may enhance the cellular immune tolerance in co-culture systems of hAD-MSCs and injured cardiomyocyte, providing a theoretical basis for the allogeneic heart transplantation.",

Cardiac function was assessed by small animal echocardiography. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the expression of miR-223-3p. The expression levels of miR-233-3p and SOX6 mRNA in the blank control group (BCG) and mock surgical group (MSG) were lower than those in the AMIG, IG, and NCG (P < 0.05), while the cardiac function indices of the BCG and MSG were higher than those of the AMIG, IG, and NCG (P < 0.05). The expression levels of miR-233-3p and SOX6 mRNA in the AMIG and NCG were significantly higher than those in the IG, while their cardiac function indices were significantly lower than those in the IG. Our findings indicate that the silencing of miR-223-3p effectively improves the cardiac function of rats, and the overexpression of miR-223-3p promotes the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.

Several miRNAs are involved in the occurrence of heart failure, and relevant therapeutic treatments are currently being developed. MicroRNA-377 (miR-377) is known to correlate with the progression of various cancers, however, its function in CH has not been determined. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate miR-377 expression in H2C9 hypertrophic cardiomyocytes in vitro and in a murine model of CH. Gene expression changes were verified via qRT-PCR. Western blotting was used for evaluation of alterations in the expression of signaling pathway-related proteins. Our results indicated that miR-377 expression was markedly upregulated in mice with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Autophagy markers were downregulated in these mice and in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes following miR-377 transfection. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-377 acts by targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). PPARγ overexpression promoted autophagy and suppressed cyclosporine A-induced CH. In contrast, PPARγ knockdown further suppressed CH and autophagy. In conclusion, our findings indicated that miR-377 accelerates CH by inhibiting autophagy via targeting PPARγ. This newly identified miR-377/PPARγ axis improves our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CH, and provides a potential new therapeutic target for its treatment.",

Human Wharton’s jelly stem cells (hWJSCs) isolated from umbilical cords have been reported to promote cartilage regeneration. Furthermore, resveratrol (RSV) has numerous beneficial effects including anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, we investigated the effects of HG (28 mM), RSV (17 µM), and both (HG-RSV) on chondrogenesis of hWJSCs as assessed by proteoglycan deposition, proliferation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared with the control (5 mM glucose). Toluidine blue staining of proteoglycans was positive under all conditions. HG enhanced the growth of differentiated cells (DCs) on days 14 and 21. Growth of DCs were decreased on day 4, but increased on days 14 and 21, following treatment with RSV and HG-RSV. Compared with the HG group, HG-RSV decreased the proliferation of DCs on days 4 and 14. COLI, COLII, and COLX transcripts were increased, while SOX9 transcript was decreased in all treated groups. IL-1α, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were decreased in RSV and HG-RSV groups. The levels of G-CSF and GM-CSF were high in HG-RSV group, while HG reduced the GM-CSF level. Thus, under HG conditions, RSV promotes chondrogenesis by increasing proteoglycans and collagen synthesis as well as by regulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

    "abstract": "It has been estimated that approximately 20% of employed adults worldwide are required to undertake shift work, which has led to severe public health decline and depression. Sini powder (SNP) has been shown to be a promising medicine. However, the effectiveness and mechanism of reducing the risk of depression for shift workers are still unclear. Thus, network pharmacological analysis and gene expression profiling were introduced to reveal the mechanism of SNP in the prevention of depression. First, five databases were used to collect the chemical compounds of SNP, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties were selected to identified high-quality compounds. Second, the targets of compounds were obtained by BATMAN-TCM. And the differentially expressed genes associated with depression among shift workers were obtained using gene expression profiling (GSE98793, GSE122541). Subsequently, key targets were screened out with a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network by String. Furthermore, functional enrichment was carried out by Metascape. Molecular docking was introduced to verify the interaction between core targets and compounds. SNP reduced the risk of depression by regulating ESR2, GPER1, TNF and APOE through the estrogen pathway and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. This study provides a scientific basis for further investigating the mechanism by which SNP prevents depression and reduces the risk of depression for shift workers.",

Subsequently, functional enrichment and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analyses were performed. Finally, transcriptional regulation analysis was performed to extract the pivotal genes. A total of 146 DEGs were screened. Of these, 56 downregulated DEGs were closely associated with the survival outcomes of BC. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis showed that these survival-related genes, including CCR7, CD27, and IL2RB, played notable roles in pathways such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and immune responses. Furthermore, PPI network and enriched sub-module network analyses revealed that CCR7, CD27, and IL2RB served as hub genes with a high degree of association. Accordingly, they were key players in BC-associated transcriptional regulatory networks. Notably, these genes exhibited strong relationships with miR-1908 and miR-663. CCR7, CD27, IL2RB, miR-1908, and miR-663 may participate in the molecular mechanisms underlying BC metastasis, probably by influencing cytokine-related pathways and immune responses; thus, they are potential, novel therapeutic targets for BC management.",

Protein–protein interactions (PPI) network and transcription factor (TF)-gene network were constructed, followed by pathway analysis. Drug-gene interactions were also predicted. Finally, the expression level of hub genes was verified using GSE126848 and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). A total of 418 (139 up-regulated and 279 down-regulated) DEGs were identified between SS and HC groups. PPI analysis revealed that FOS, MYC, IL1B, and EGR1 might be considered as hub genes. Pathway analysis showed that these genes were mainly involved in TNF signaling pathway. Drug-gene interaction analysis identified six gene targets (PTGS2, IL1B, MMP9, CCL2, JUN, and IL6) and 38 small molecules. Further experimental verification confirmed that the expression level of FOS, MYC, IL1B, and EGR1 was significantly down-regulated in the SS samples. In conclusion, these data may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of SS. These hub genes and candidate drugs may improve the individualized diagnosis and treatment of SS.",

Site elevation significantly affected k and T50% while time affected mass loss, residual weight, remaining C and N at p < .01 in field. After 360 days of decomposition, ∼48% residual weight with 11.7 ± 0.4% of C and 1.07 ± 0.06% of N was observed in the litter bags. Higher elevations (850–1020 m) were recorded with low C and N mineralization compared to 600–850 m elevations indicating their potential for long term carbon storage. Warming (+4.5°C) significantly accelerated the pace of decomposition in microcosms with comparatively higher mass loss (+26%), k (+34%), and soil CO2 efflux (+50%) reducing T50% by 77 days than observed under ambient conditions (To). The effect of moisture was insignificant but comparatively, decomposition was high at M20%. The study concludes that future warming will significantly accelerate the pace of nutrient cycling reducing the carbon storage potential of this ecosystem.",

Nine-cm Whatman number 1 filter paper that is partitioned into treatment, neutral and non-treatment portions was used for the experiment. Each solvent extract treatment was applied at 2.5, 5 and 10% rates. Insects were released in the neutral portion, while the untreated part served as a control. A choice bioassay experimental method that is laid down in a completely randomized design within three replications was used. 5 and 10% rates of the polar solvent extracts of Calpurnia aurea leaves induced significantly (p < 0.05) higher percentage weevils and beetles repellency (≥50.00%) at 2 days after treatment than non-polar and partial polar solvent extract treatments and the untreated check. 10% dosage of Calpurnia aurea leaves' polar solvent extract treatments caused 100% weevils and beetles repellency three days after treatment. Consequently, the polar solvent extracts of the tested plant were potent and could be used at 5 and 10% rates for the maize weevils and the red flour beetles' management under farmers' maize storage conditions. Nevertheless, their impact on cost-effectiveness, natural enemies and human beings needs additional study.",

IgAN is caused by NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3), which regulates innate immunity. Gubentongluo (GB) decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine, is an effective clinical treatment for IgAN in China. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In this study, IgA1, which is separated from patients with IgAN, together with GB decoction was applied to treat human mesangial cells (HMCs). CCK-8 and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to assess cell proliferation and the production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), respectively. qPCR and Western blot were applied to detect the expression levels of NLRP3, IL-1β, and caspase-1. Our results showed that GB decoction inhibited IgA1-induced cell proliferation and IL-1β production. Furthermore, IgA1-induced upregulation of IL-1β, NLRP3, and caspase-1 was reduced after treatment with GB. Interestingly, MCC950, an NLRP3 inhibitor, showed similar effect as GB decoction. Additionally, NLRP3 overexpression stimulated cell proliferation, IL-1β secretion, and the expressions of IL-1β and caspase-1 in HMCs. But these effects could be alleviated by GB decoction. In conclusion, GB may play a protective role in IgAN cell model by inhibiting NLRP3.",

TXYF treatment prevented DNBS-induced dysregulation of gut microbial communities. Compared with DNBS-colitis group, the abundance of Firmicutes increased significantly and that of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria decreased in DNBS + TXYF group. Pathways such as protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway was enriched in the DNBS-colitis group, whereas it was decreased in the DNBS + TXYF group.

Here, we analyzed the transcript abundance of key autophagy genes in the conjugation pathway including ATG3, ATG4, ATG5, ATG7, ATG8, ATG10, ATG12 and ATG16 in response to nitrogen deficiency, pathogen infection and oxidative stress in Cucumis sativus. ATG8 protein abundance was analyzed using immunoblot analysis. Seven out of 13 autophagy genes studied have splice variances including ATG3, ATG4, ATG5, ATG8b, ATG8c, ATG8e and ATG10. All except ATG5 have changes in transcript variances abundance upon nitrogen starvation, indicating regulation via alternative splicing is pervasive in autophagy genes. This is the first report of alternative splicing in autophagy genes in cucumbers. However, transcription control is also important, especially in ATG4, and those without transcript variances. Moreover, different environment cues regulate autophagy genes through different mechanisms. The ATG8 protein tag was also regulated at the protein level through post-translational modification and blockage of degradation. This work shows that the regulation of autophagy in cucumber is complex and involves many mechanisms. Better understanding of autophagy regulation would thus help breeding plants that perform better even under environmental stresses.",

Malondialdehyde concentrations in the treated groups' aqueous humor and plasma were considerably lower (p < 0.05) than in group 2. Compared to group 2, glutathione, nitric oxide, and antioxidant levels improved significantly (p < 0.05). C-reactive protein and glutamate levels in group 2 were comparable (p > 0.05). FPMSE substantially reduced phospholipase A2 activity. Histological assessment of the ciliary body showed adequate pigmentations in the treatment groups compared to group 2.

This study aimed to determine the digito-palmar dermatoglyphic patterns of schizophrenia patients in Ghana. Digito-palmar dermatoglyphics were obtained using a digital scanner, and the details studied. Individuals living with schizophrenia in Ghana were significantly characterized by low odds of vestige pattern in the hypothenar region, low odds of palmar creases 300, and high and low odds of radial loop (RL) and plain arch (PA) respectively at the finger patterns relative to the control group [OR (95% CI): vestige, 0.2 (0.06–0.69), P = 0.01; palmar creases 300, 0.1 (0.01–0.99), P = 0.049; PA, 0.4 (0.3–0.7), P < 0.001; RL, 1.9 (1.0–3.7), P = 0.044].

For differentially expressed macrophages, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional enrichment analyses, and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was analyzed to understand further the role of macrophages in the occurrence and development of disease.Methods: GSE 179285 dataset and GSE123141 dataset were downloaded from the GEO database. We used the CIBERSORT algorithm to map immune cell infiltration between paired inflamed and uninflamed intestinal mucosal biopsies. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses were used to analyze DEGs in intestinal macrophage populations. The PPI network was constructed by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database. Immunohistochemistry and qPCR were used to verify hub genes in the mouse model of UC.Results: The inflamed tissues had a higher infiltration of M1 macrophages and M0 macrophages. M2 macrophages, naive B cells, gamma delta T cells (γδT cells), and resting mast cells were more abundant in uninflamed tissues. Functional enrichment analyses showed that the 141 DEGs are involved in multiple processes in the inflammatory response. The three genes (LCN2, CXCL1, SAA1) had the highest degrees of connectivity and may be hub genes. LCN2 was significantly overexpressed in colitis tissues compared with normal control tissues in the mouse model of UC.Conclusion: Changes in macrophages were notable in the inflamed mucosa of UC patients. 141 DEGs were entered into GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses; three hub gene candidates were selected.Highlights: There were significant differences in the distribution of macrophages in the inflamed and uninflamed mucosa of UC patients.Functional enrichment analyses of DEGs in UC-associated intestinal macrophages were displayed.Three genes (LCN2, CXCL1, SAA1) were identified as hub gene candidates.",

Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) plays an important role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma; however, the role of the MCT1 inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (α-CHCA) in renal fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the role of α-CHCA, an MCT1 inhibitor, in treating renal fibrosis associated with CKD. We used α-CHCA in a CKD mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), and mouse proximal tubular epithelial cells (mPTCs) stimulated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). In vivo, administration of α-CHCA improved tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which was consistent with the reduced expression of collagen I/III, fibronectin (FN1), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in the kidneys of UUO mice. Similarly, the overexpression of inflammatory factors in UUO kidneys decreased in response to α-CHCA treatment. In vitro, α-CHCA pretreatment inhibited the induction of collagen I/III, FN1, and α-SMA production in mPTCs treated with TGF-β1. Collectively, these findings indicate that α-CHCA may play a therapeutic role in renal fibrosis associated with CKD by inhibiting collagen deposition and subsequent fibrosis and inflammation.Highlights Chronic kidney disease (CKD) mice have increased MCT1 expression.α-CHCA, a MCT1 inhibitor, alleviates renal fibrosis in CKD mice.α-CHCA improves the inflammation in CKD mice.α-CHCA inhibits TGF-β1-induced extracellular matrix secretion of proximal tubular epithelial cells.",

The expression and relationship of genes with clinical characteristics in normal and CD intestinal mucosa were validated in GSE208303 and our research cohorts. Five genes related to disease and inflammation were identified in the clinically significant modules that were differentially expressed in healthy controls and CD patients.

    "abstract": "Ameloblastomas are benign tumors associated with recurrence and morbidity. Mutations in the V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and smoothened (SMO) genes have been identified in ameloblastomas. The mutation rate of BRAF in different regions and mutation sites of SMO remains controversial. This study assesses the relationship between these mutations and clinicopathological features of ameloblastoma in Chinese patients. Ameloblastomas were surgically removed from 30 patients and BRAF gene polymorphisms were detected using DNA sequencing analysis. We also examined the relationship between BRAF or SMO mutations and clinicopathological parameters. BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 18 of 30 ameloblastomas. No significant correlation was found between BRAF V600E mutation and age, sex, location, histologic type, capsular invasion, or tumor recurrence. Five cases carried an SMO T364N mutation in exon 5, whereas six carried an SMO S590 T mutation in exon 10. The SMO mutation rate in patients aged ≤ 20 years was significantly higher than that in patients aged > 20 years. SMO T364N and S590 T mutations were closely related to age and capsular invasion. These findings indicate that BRAF V600E, SMO T364N, and SMO S590 T mutations play important roles in the pathogenesis of ameloblastoma.",

Furthermore, a nomogram model containing possible prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS) was constructed using R software. A total of 2975 patients from the SEER database were included in this investigation. N-stage, grade, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, brain metastasis, bone metastasis, liver metastasis, and lung metastasis were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. These variables were subsequently incorporated into the nomogram model. Calibration curves demonstrated a good correlation between nomogram predictions and actual observations. The nomogram model exhibits the potential to estimate the individualized survival of MGC patients.",

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot assay were utilized to measure RNA and protein expression. Cell proliferation was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and colony formation assay. Transwell assays were conducted to analyze cell motility. Intermolecular interaction was verified via dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA-pull down assay. Circ_0000518 expression was up-regulated in BC tissues and cell lines. Circ_0000518 interference suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolytic metabolism and promoted the apoptosis of BC cells. Circ_0000518 acted as a molecular sponge for microRNA-1258 (miR-1258), and circ_0000518 interference-mediated effects in BC cells were largely alleviated by the addition of anti-miR-1258. MiR-1258 interacted with the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in BC cells, and miR-1258 suppressed the malignant behaviors of BC cells partly through down-regulating ZEB1. Circ_0000518 interference significantly suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo. Circ_0000518/miR-1258/ZEB1 signaling cascade was identified in this study for the first time.

The population was randomly separated into a training group (n = 3963) and a validation group (n = 1982). Age, histological grade, T stage, N stage, regional nodes examination, tumor size, and CEA were independent prognostic factors for OS and were used in the nomogram.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of the circular RNA (circRNA) antisense to the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript (CDR1as) during competitive inhibition of microRNA-7 (miR-7) in the regulation of autophagy to modulate the proliferation and migration of breast cancer stem cells. The CD44+/CD24- phenotype breast cancer stem cells were sorted from the original MCF7 cell by flow cytometry. RT-qPCR was applied to assess the expression of CDR1as and miR-7 in MCF7-Parent and MCF7-Stem cells. The activity of autophagy was evaluated followed the knockdown and overexpression of CDR1as. The correlation between CDR1as and miR-7 and between CDR1as and miR-7-target mRNAs were evaluated. This study revealed that CDR1as overexpression was associated with up-regulation of autophagy and that CDR1as competitive inhibition of miR-7 enhanced the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling and autophagy-associated genes in breast cancer stem cells. CDR1as promoted the cell growth and migration of breast CSCs via the CDR1as/miR-7 axis, and knockdown of CDR1as and miR-7 overexpression obviously impaired the ability of growth and migration. The present study added a new view of developing a new therapeutic strategy against breast cancer.",

Each eRNA in PCa samples was divided into high- and low-expression groups. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to identify the eRNAs significantly associated with the overall survival of PCa. Their correlations with age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and tumor stage were analyzed using Spearman coefficients. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEEG) analyzes were used to predict the possible biological functions and pathways associated with eRNAs.Results: We identified 12 eRNAs associated with PCa survival, of which PARGP1 was the most clinically significant. It was associated with biochemical recurrence in PCa patients and was also a valuable complement to distinguish between PSA 0–4 ng/ml and 4–10 ng/ml.

The function of LUM in gastric cancer remains rarely reported and largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression of LUM in gastric cancer as well as its association with clinical parameters. Data from the GEO and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases are used for further validation. GC tissue shows significantly high expression of LUM compared with normal tissue (P < 0.001). High expression of LUM is correlated with poor differentiation, advanced tumor stage, deeper local invasion and worse overall survival. Patients with high expression of LUM have significantly worse prognosis than those with low expression. Multivariate analysis shows that high expression of LUM is an independent risk factor for overall survival. Several biomolecular pathways, including extracellular matrix receptor interaction, melanoma, cancer, chemokine signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling and Wnt signaling, are screened out as significantly enriched in GCs with high LUM expression using GSEA. Our study reveals that LUM, as an independent predictor, is highly expressed and associated with clinicopathologic factors in gastric cancer, demonstrating potential applications in prognosis of patient with gastric cancer.",

However, few studies have found the immune genomic profile and immune subclasses of OC based on transcriptome data, which may help to optimally stratify patients who respond to immunotherapy. The present study used unsupervised hierarchical clustering to identify three immunogenomic subgroups, termed hyperimmunogenic (Immunity_H), moderately immunogenic (Immunity_M) and hypoimmunogenic (Immunity_L), based on two publicly available OC transcriptomics datasets. Each subtype was associated with specific pathways. Furthermore, the Immunity_H subtype had higher levels of immune cell infiltration, antitumor immunoreactivity and better survival prognosis compared to the other subtypes. The potential chemotherapeutic targets for OC were assessed in the GDSC dataset. Several potential drug targets for the treatment of OC were identified, including Parthenolide and the AKT inhibitor VIII, Paclitaxel. In addition, the Immunity_H subgroup had an early FIGO stage and was more likely to respond to immunotherapy. The characterization of immune-based OC subgroups may provide useful insights for the treatment of OC and has the potential to guide personalized treatment of OC patients through immunotherapy.",

Antioxidant peptides can scavenge free radicals such as 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS+), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitic oxide (NO) in vitro, but little is known about their functions in vivo. Here, we evaluated the effects of an antioxidant peptide (antioxidant-RL) used at the beginning of reperfusion on myocardial IR injury. We performed 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (TTC) to determine myocardial infarct size. Creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin-T (CTnT), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The levels of ROS were measured with a fluorometric Intracellular ROS kit. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins in cardiomyocytes were detected by western blotting. Antioxidant-RL (10 mg/kg) reduced the infarct size and levels of CK-MB and CTnT in rats. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 also decreased. Furthermore, ROS levels were ameliorated and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in myocytes was down-regulated by antioxidant-RL (100 µg/mL). Antioxidant-RL exerted protective effects on myocardial IR injury by scavenging excessive ROS, suppressing inflammatory factors, and inhibiting cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Thus, antioxidant-RL may serve as a potent candidate for the treatment of IR injury.",

    "abstract": "The molecular phylogeny of Kazakhstan's Fritillaria karelinii (Fisch. ex D. Don) Baker was reconstructed and analyzed to confirm its genetic identification and phylogenetic position. The BLAST results were matched at a high rate of 98%, and (nrITS and rbcL) formed a single clade in the phylogenetic analysis. The studied plant belongs to the branch of the subgenus Fritillaria Tourn. ex L., which is consistent with the literature. This confirmed a clear genetic identification and taxonomic position of the studied plant. Despite some sequence differences between the Kazakhstani and Chinese species (C1, C3, C5) found in the nrITS region, no specific sequence existed for the other markers (rbcL and trnH-psbA). The outcomes of the antioxidant activity of F. karelinii fractions were prepared by extraction with 70% ethanol and separation into several fractions using the partition procedure with chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water. Among these, the ethyl acetate fraction most significantly affected the activity in the FC, DPPH, and FRAP assays.",

    "abstract": "Background: It is well known that cognitive function is associated with gender differences. However, the effect of sex differences on the relationship between lipids fractions and cognitive function in older adults has been contentious. Methods: 2,170 participants from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999-2002 and 2011-2014) were included. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) were measured. Cognitive function was assessed using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Multiple linear regression models and restricted cubic spline curve fitting were used. Results: Overall, low HDL-C levels were negatively associated with DSST scores in every group. The levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C were not significantly associated with DSST scores, not only in the total population but also in the males. In the females, after adjustment for potential confounding factors, high TC levels were negatively related to DSST scores (OR = −3.590, 95% CI: – 6.343 to – 0.837), and high TG levels were found positively associated with DSST scores (OR = 2.323, 95% CI: 0.159–4.488). Conclusion: Low plasma HDL is associated with cognitive dysfunction in older adults. In older women, high TC levels are positively associated with cognitive decline while high TG levels may protect cognitive function.",

This case–control study comprised two groups with 100 participants (50 T2D and 50 DN patients) and aimed to examine the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes encoding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX), glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1), and glutathione peroxidase 1(GPX1) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) risk in patients with T2D. An SNP genotyping assay was performed using TaqMan assay and real-time PCR to identify the SNPs (NOX rs4673, GSTP rs1695, GPX1 rs1050450). The Sanger method was used to validate our findings. Fisher chi-square analyses revealed no significant differences in these genes when comparing T2D patients with and without DN.

Soil organic matter (SOM) of darker color soils, which have rich humus and minerals, is higher than others such as red soils. The aim of this study is to construct models to predict SOM for a range of colors using a smartphone as an image-capturing device. Random forest of classification (RFC), random forest of logical regression (RFLR), convolutional neural network (CNN) and MobileNet models are compared, which is better for SOM prediction. Soil photos were collected by smartphone in a camera obscura with a steady light. After treatment by OpenCV, photos were separated by SOM content into five groups. The prediction accuracies of RFC, RFLR, CNN and MobileNet were 0.9743, 0.5614, 0.9600 and 0.7915, respectively. Based on these results, the RFC model for SOM has the best performance both in training and validation. The proposed combination of smartphone and machine learning-based prediction models provide a fast, economic, and robust approach to monitor, detect, and predict SOM contents in precision and intelligence agriculture.",

Over this period, a total of 57,478,155 Class A and B infectious disease cases were documented, demonstrating an overall decline in incidence. Using a two-way fixed effects model, we found that an increase in the percentage of the illiterate population relative to the total population (P < 0.05), the density of paved roads per capita (P < 0.001), and the accessibility of family health service personnel per capita (P < 0.01) were associated with higher disease incidence. In contrast, enhanced access to public green space per capita (P < 0.001) and increased number of public transportation vehicles per 10,000 inhabitants (P < 0.05) were associated reduced disease incidence. These findings underscore the profound impact of social determinants, such as literacy rates, family health service availability, and urban infrastructure, on the management and control of infectious diseases.",

ENST433110 expression was assessed using RT-PCR, cell migration was evaluated using a Transwell assay, and cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Our findings revealed that ENST433110 expression was dramatically reduced in TC sample tissues and TC cells (B-CPAP and TPC-1). Moreover, we showed that lncRNA ENST433110 overexpression inhibited cell migration and proliferation in TC cells. Furthermore, lncRNA ENST433110 overexpression enhanced cell apoptosis and induced a noticeable reduction in Bcl-2 expression and an increase in BAX expression in both TPC-1 and B-CPAP cells compared with that in control groups.

    "abstract": "Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) usually causes multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome and exhibits a high mortality rate. It has been previously reported that berberine, as a dominant alkaloid, can be effectively used against inflammation. However, there is limited data on the effects of berberine hydrochloride (BBRH) on inflammation in SAP rat models. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were given preliminary intraperitoneal injections of BBRH 30 min prior to retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate in their biliopancreatic ducts. The rats were sacrificed 12 h after taurocholate administration, and tissues and blood samples were then acquired for histological, chemical, and molecular analyses. The SAP models exhibited enhanced edema, ascitic fluid volume, neutrophil infiltration, serum amylase and lipase levels, and interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-1β levels, and reduced IL-10 concentration, while BBRH administration reversed these changes. Further study showed that in the SAP model, protein and mRNA levels of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B (NFκB) p65 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were increased and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (IκBα) expression was decreased, while pretreatment with BBRH significantly decreased the activation of the TLR4/IκBα/NFκB pathway. The data obtained displayed that BBRH mitigated acute pancreatitis by suppressing the TLR4/IκB/NFκB pathway.",

    "abstract": "Background: 8-week old Sprague Dawley rats represent the standard rodent model of oesophageal surgery, which is challenging and might be eased by larger oesophageal lengths. Therefore, we aimed to analyse whether oesophageal length would linearly increase with bodyweight and ensure comparable experimental conditions. Methods: We analysed 41 8-week old Sprague Dawley rats of both sexes by linear regression of oesophageal length with sex as an interaction term for bodyweight. Based on exploratory investigations, analyses were powered to 80% for a deviation of the regression’s slope from zero. Results: Linear regression was statistically significant with F(3,37) = 3.29, P=0.0312 with an adjusted R² of 0.15 (95% CI: 0.02–0.43). Oesophageal length could be modelled by 4.56 (95% CI: 1.45–6.69) + 0.007 (95% CI: −0.002–0.019) x bodyweight in grams + 6.7 (95% CI: 1.86–11.1) x sex (1=male) – 0.02 (95% CI: −0.04–(−0.005)) x bodyweight x sex. Exploration of the interaction revealed that oesophageal length increased with bodyweight for female rats, but decreased in males. Conclusions: Sex represents a major interaction for oesophageal length in an age-adjusted cohort of Sprague Dawley rats. This may have relevant implications for reproducibility of rat models of oesophageal surgery, but may be different in inbred strains.",

The cure rate, drug resistance rate, number of treatment courses, and adverse reactions were compared between both groups. Results : Age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and score, prechemotherapy β-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels, and the nature of the last pregnancy were associated with the development of resistance. Furthermore, age, FIGO stage III, and a hydatidiform mole in the last pregnancy were independent risk factors for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after MTX + CF or ACT-D chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Both MTX + CF and ACT-D had a high cure rate and a low rate of resistance in gestational trophoblastic tumors. The adverse reaction incidence was lower in the MTX + CF group than in the ACT-D group.

Transcriptome studies show CDR1 expression in tumor cell lines and leukocytes of normal subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease. We investigated CDR1 expression in cultured fibroblasts of DS patients compared with normal subjects. The study of CDR1 mRNA was performed with qRT-PCR. Immunofluorescence and Western blot were used for the analysis of the CDR1 protein. Our data show that both CDR1 mRNA and protein are expressed in human fibroblasts and that the CDR1 gene is down-regulated in DS fibroblasts compared to controls.

    "abstract": "With its high incidence and mortality rate, lung cancer is one of the malignancies that poses the greatest threat to the health and life of the population. Mounting research found that the Membrane-spanning 4A (MS4A) family took part in tumor development. Nevertheless, the expression and prognostic value of the MS4A family genes in lung cancer remained unclear. Compared with normal tissues, the transcript levels of MS4A2, MS4A4A, MS4A4E, MS4A6A, MS4A6E, MS4A7, MS4A8, MS4A14, and MS4A15 were significantly decreased in lung cancer tissues, and there was a significant correlation between MS4A2, MS4A8, MS4A15, and the pathological stage of lung cancer patients. Survival analysis has shown that lung cancer patients with lower mRNA expression levels of MS4A2, MS4A4E, and MS4A15 had poorer prognosis. The function of MS4A family genes was primarily involved in immune-related pathways. Based on the results, it was indicated that the expression of the MS4A family was significantly correlated with the infiltration of immune cells (B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells). In conclusions, our research indicated that MS4A family might become a new immunotherapy target and prognostic biomarker for lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "The orchid mantis Hymenopus coronatus (Insecta: Mantodea) is famous for its unique appearance, which resembles a flower blossom with petal-like legs and a whitish pink colour. Based on this appearance, H. coronatus has been hypothesized to be an aggressive mimic that attracts pollinators. Research on the orchid mantis has been sparse due to the difficulty of collection and maintenance. The first record of orchid mantis from Xishuangbanna, China, was originally named H. coronatoides but later considered synonymous with H. coronatus based on a morphological study. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome of the orchid mantis from Xishuangbanna, China, was determined to be a circular molecule of 15,589 bp containing 37 typical mitochondrial genes in the same gene arrangement as those of other praying mantises. The relatively low degree of genetic difference between orchid mantises from China and Malaysia suggests that they belong to the same species. The phylogenetic relationships inferred from 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) show that H. coronatus is a sister to Parymenopus davisoni, another rare species from Malaysia, and supports monophyletic Hymenopodinae, whereas Acromantinae is polyphyletic. This study provides useful data for studies on the population genetics, phylogeny and mimicry mechanism of the orchid mantis.",

Therefore, we anticipate a change in the circulatory profile of miRNAs in IR subjects compared to normal glucose tolerance subjects. In the present study, we sought to identify the circulating miRNAs associated with IR as biomarkers in Qatari population. The circulating miRNA profile was assessed in a pilot study of healthy volunteers (n = 22) whose insulin sensitivity was quantitated by euglycemic hyperinsulemic clamp. Moreover, in the validation phase (n = 40) subjects were added including lean and obese T2D. MiR-186 showed a consistent significant increase in insulin resistance subjects compared to NGT in the discovery and validation phase analysis. In addition, intergroup comparison of circulating miRNA pinpointed 2 miRNAs: MiR-122 increased substantially in obese T2D subjects, with diagnostic value to predict obesity in T2D subjects, and let-7b increased significantly in lean T2D subjects. Our results suggest that circulating miRNAs serve as biomarkers for IR, T2D and obesity in Qatari population. Further functional studies are warranted to better identify the targets of these miRNAs and understand the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms.",

The aim of this study was to define their characteristics, prognostic factors, and the impacts of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy on outcomes.Methods: Adult patients (age ≥18 years) with ONGs from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were included. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were utilized to analyze the factors associated with survival. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate the impacts of adjuvant therapies on overall survival (OS).Results: A total of 179 adult patients diagnosed with ONGs were identified between 1991 and 2016, with a median follow-up period of 64.0 months. Multivariate analysis showed age at diagnosis, tumor grade, adjuvant chemotherapy were significant factors for OS. The employment of adjuvant RT or chemotherapy significantly shortened OS time in the low-grade group and could not prolong OS time in the high-grade group.Conclusions This is the largest retrospective study of adult ONGs up to date. The overall prognosis of high-grade ONGs in adult patients is still poor despite multi-modality treatments. Adjuvant RT or chemotherapy should be applied cautiously before full clinical evaluation in adult patients with low-grade ONGs.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal tumor is a common malignancy that is dangerous to human health. Some of the patients exhibit familial hereditary syndromes; however, the molecular genetics of hereditary gastrointestinal tumors remain unclear. Here, a Chinese family including 21 people was investigated. Among them, three cases were respectively diagnosed with gastric cancer, colon cancer, and liver cancer; one case was diagnosed with cystic ovarian. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were applied to identify the pathogenic mutation of four patients. A novel frameshift mutation in exon 49 (c.7141_7151del) of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene was detected in three patients with gastric cancer, colon cancer, and cystic ovarian but absent in patient with liver cancer. This mutation was co-segregated with the disease phenotype and was predicted to be pathogenic. The deletion mutation in the ATM gene led to a frameshift mutation of the bases after ATM, ultimately causing the protein code to terminate at 2,401st amino acids (p.N2381fs). Our results detected a novel mutation of ATM in a family with hereditary gastrointestinal tumors and expanded the mutation spectrum of ATM gene. Taken together, these findings provide vital information about the possible detection of tumor occurrence and progression, contributing towards hereditary cancer prevention and screening.Abbreviations: ATM: Ataxia telangiectasia mutated; InDels: Insertions and deletions; NCCN: National Comprehensive Cancer Network; SNVs: Single nucleotide variations; WES: Whole-exome sequencing",

Twelve immune-related prognostic co-stimulatory molecules were screened. Based on the expression of these molecules, all samples were divided into four clusters by Consensus clustering analysis. Clusters 2 and 4 were associated with worse survival and favorable prognosis, respectively. The proportion of patients with different age, Pathologic T and Pathologic stage among these four clusters showed significant differences. Cluster 4 was associated with a higher proportion of patients with pathological N0 and T1–2, as well as early tumors (stages I–II). Additionally, these clusters significantly differed in terms of immune infiltration of memory B cells, regulatory T cells, M2 macrophages, and activated memory CD4+ T cells, as well as the expression of six checkpoint genes. Worse survival was associated with a high rather than a low TMB; among the clusters, clusters 4 and 2 had the lowest and highest TMB, respectively.

Decades of previous research have elucidated many molecular and physiological responses of plants to this stress. Since Arabidopsis thaliana has been established as a model organism in this area of research, in this study, we started by replicating published results of seven sensitive and tolerant ecotypes of Arabidopsis to dark-submergence stress to assess its generalizability and consistency, adapted a leaf-damage index to quantify the progression of stress over time, and measured the recalcitrance of all those ecotypes to Agrobacterium transformation. By using photographic comparisons, median lethal time (LT50), and leaf-damage index, we ascertained that the order of tolerance reported by previous studies is robust enough to allow independent replications (Cvi-0 < Ita-0 < Bay-0 < Col-0 < Kin-0 < Lp2-6 < C24), supporting their consistency. We continued by testing the transformation recalcitrance of all seven ecotypes to three different Agrobacterium strains and identified C24 and Cvi-0 as the most suitable ecotypes useful in a transformation platform despite their low transformation frequencies (<0.1%). The results from this study can be useful in developing transgenic methodologies that enhance plant responses to stress and transitioning these methodologies from the laboratory to the field.",

Here, we analyzed the endogenous hormones before sunburn and found that salicylic acid (SA) and gibberellins (GAs) were very significantly correlated between pericarp and seed kernel. However, there weren't closely related to abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, jasmonic acids (JAs), and cytokinin. The content of indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICA) and 3-indolebutyric acid (IBA) in the pericarp was higher than in seed kernel, and IBA was only found in the pericarp.

SA was positively correlated with ABA in pericarp and GAs and SA in seed kernel and pericarp. JAs in fruit generally showed a downward trend, and methyl jasmonate (ME-JA) appeared in pericarp.",

The data were obtained by analysing tissues from rats exposed to the pesticides for 90 days via drinking water. The administration of the mixture of six pesticides was chosen to mimic a possible human exposure scenario. We compared conventional methods used in regulatory toxicity studies to evaluate the safety of pesticide exposure (gross pathology, serum biochemistry) to new molecular profiling methods encompassing the analysis of the caecum and blood metabolome, liver transcriptome, liver DNA methylation, liver small RNA profiles, and caecum metagenome of the exposed animals. Altogether, these investigations provided in-depth molecular profiling in laboratory animals exposed to pesticides revealing metabolic perturbations that would remain undetected by standard regulatory biochemical measures.

    "abstract": "As a regulatory cell death caused by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis is very important in the healthy development or disease progression of various organisms. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid with vigorous immunosuppressive activity and anti-inflammatory effects. On the other hand, it can cause some side effects under long-term or high-dose administration, including secondary osteoporosis and osteonecrosis, which are associated with the elevated autophagy and involvement of ferroptosis. Autophagy, an intracellular degradation system, plays a crucial role in ferroptosis. It has been increasingly proved that ferroptosis is potentially related to the dexamethasone-induced side effects, in which autophagy may be involved. However, the regulatory mechanism of ferroptosis in the dexamethasone-induced side effects is unclear. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis, the dexamethasone-induced side effects, and the potential relationships between ferroptosis and dexamethasone-induced side effects, aiming to provide novel insight into the interplay between them.",

This study explored the role of Placenta specific 8 (Plac8) in MI on the basis of single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data (GSE136088) and micro-array data (GSE153485). Through bioinformatics analysis, Plac8 was finally identified as a key gene related to fibroblasts. In addition, primary CFs of the neonatal mice were isolated, cultured and treated with hypoxia for in vitro cell model construction. Hydroxyproline assay demonstrated enhanced collagen production in hypoxic CFs, and qRT-PCR revealed increased relative contents of type I and type III collagen (Col1a1 and Col3a1). Western blot showed increased protein expression level of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and transwell assay and wound-healing assay collectively suggested enhanced cell migration. Moreover, Plac8 was found to be upregulated in hypoxic CFs. Then, after transfection with siNC or siPlac8, it was revealed that down-regulating Plac8 protein expression in hypoxic CFs reduced the levels of collagen secretion, the number of activated CFs and the degree of cell migration, indicating the regulation of Plac8 on hypoxic CFs' transformation into myofibroblasts, cell migration and collagen deposition. Excessive myocardial fibrosis can cause adverse cardiac remodeling, leading to malignant arrhythmia and even heart failure.",

We demonstrate a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) based method for genomic copy number determination of improved Cre (iCre), which was tested in a transgenic mouse model of CYP19A1-iCre. The standards were derived from tandem repeats of iCre fragments which were constructed by a new application of megaprimer PCR. Two rounds of megaprimer PCR were used to obtain specific tandem repeats of iCre fragments, which were subsequently cloned into pUCm-T vectors. After the fragments of IL-2 (reference gene) were ligated into the same vectors, standards with copy number ratios (CNR) of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 between iCre and IL-2 were completed. The R2 values of the standard curves exceeded 0.99. The calculated CNR value of the quality control sample was satisfactory. Multiple copies of iCre were detected in founder mice. After several passages, the copy number of iCre gradually decreased to a single copy, which was consistent with theoretical expectation. The established method is a universal and sensitive program for genomic copy number determination of iCre in transgenic mice.",

The discovery of tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in the mechanism of pyroptosis is a breakthrough. We aim to study whether tsRNA is involved in TN progression through pyroptosis. A TN rat model was constructed by chronic constriction injury of infraorbital nerve and then mechanical hyperalgesia was quantitated using a withdrawal threshold test. Mechanical hyperalgesia was significantly elevated by constriction injury. Immunofluorescence revealed that expression of GSDMD and NLRP3 were significantly enhanced in TN rats. The expression of caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 was significantly boosted after TN induction. CoPP + H2O2 exposure induced cell injury and pyroptosis of rat Schwann RSC96 cells, but reversed by VX-765 (a caspase-1 inhibitor). A total of 87 differentially expressed tsRNAs (DEtsRNAs) were identified in TN rats. KEGG pathway enrichment showed that DEtsRNAs were mainly involved in pyroptosis-related pathways, such as MAPK, ErbB, and mTOR signaling pathways. RT-qPCR showed that pyroptosis-related DEtsRNAs of tsRNA003489, tsRNA001840, and tsRNA003424 were downregulated in TN. Network analysis indicated tsRNA003489 and tsRNA001840 interact with NLRP3, a key regulator of pyroptosis. tsRNA has potential to participate in TN progression by targeting pyroptosis-related genes, which provides a new perspective for understanding pathology of TN.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, ferroptosis has been identified as a novel type of regulated cell death. As a cell death process, it differs from other processes like necrosis and apoptosis in the expression of morphology, biochemistry, and genetics. Ferroptosis provides a new view of programmed cell death. It is initiated by the oxidation of lipids, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and iron buildup within cells, leading to their demise. The identification of these biochemical events triggering ferroptosis has expanded understanding of controlled cellular suicide. A significant role of ferroptosis in osteoarthritis (OA) has been reported in recent studies. Both OA and ferroptosis exhibit anomalies in metabolism of iron, oxidation of lipids, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nonetheless, our understanding of the specific genes involved in regulating ferroptosis in the context of OA is currently limited. Expanding our knowledge in this area could have profound implications for effectively managing and treating OA. This review offers an in-depth exploration of the molecular processes associated with ferroptosis. Furthermore, we discuss the roles of ferrioptosis in different aspects of osteoarthritis, encompassing the degradation of cartilage, synovitis, dysfunction of chondrocytes, and the manifestation of OA-related pain. We highlight the potential of targeting ferroptosis for OA treatment.",

Identifying the underlying causes and causative pathogens is essential for effective disease management. In this experiment, we observed the Malformation Syndrome in Prunus salicina Lindl and used the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) to compare fungal diversity between malformed and healthy leaf buds. These results show a higher level of fungal diversity in diseased leaf buds. Alternaria, Curvibasidium, Symmetrospora, Fonsecazyma, and other genera among the identified fungi are suspected to induce the malformations. Potential contributors to these malformations include Endophyte-plant_Pathogen and Plant_pathogen-Undefined_saprotroph.

Significant differences in EEG LZC were found at electrode positions F4 and P3 when comparing CD patients with a disease duration of over 10 years to those with a duration of less than 10 years. In CD, the connections between the occipital region and other brain regions may be reduced, and the dynamic behaviors may be simplified.

The downstream target of miR-33a-3p was predicted using TargetScan and miRDB analysis software. The expression profiles of myf5 and sox11 in tumor tissues were determined using RT–PCR and western blot analysis. miR-33a-3p expression was downregulated in PCD tissues (P < 0.01) and targeted myf5 and sox11, whose expression levels were positively correlated with that of miR-33a-3p. In addition, Tongguan Liyan Decoction increased the viability and proliferation of muscle satellite cells, whereas an opposite effect was observed in tumor cells. Furthermore, in vivo experiment results demonstrated that Tongguan Liyan Decoction ameliorated the pathological conditions of tumor tissues in PCD rats (P < 0.001). Tongguan Liyan Decoction could upregulate the expression of miR-33a-3p and its downstream targets to ameliorate the pathological conditions of muscle satellite cells and inhibit the viability and proliferation of tumor cells, thereby improving PCD in elderly patients.",

The results of the present study miR-125-5p are significantly (P < .05) downregulated in human osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-125-5p resulted in a significant (P < .5) decrease of the osteosarcoma cells via induction of autophagy. Additionally, overexpression of miR-125-5p also decreased the migration and invasive potential of the osteosarcoma cells. Bioinformatic analysis and dual-luciferase assays revealed that miR-125-5p targets KLF13. Post-transcriptional suppression of KLF13 by miR-125-5p results in the inhibition of osteosarcoma cells. Nonetheless, overexpression of KLF13 could abolish the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-125-5p.

    "abstract": "Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) is a highly aggressive cancer that most commonly occurs in the extremities and trunk but is extremely rare in the kidney. This study reports a 60-year-old woman with obstinate cough and fever as the first symptoms and an initial diagnosis of inflammatory lung disease. However, none of the symptoms improved after one month of treatment. A repeated chest computed tomography (CT) scan suggested a huge renal mass in the left kidney; therefore, a radical nephrectomy was finally performed in the urology department. And the postoperative pathological examinations revealed UPS. Interestingly, the bothersome symptoms of the patient magically disappeared on the 2nd day after the surgery. During a follow-up of 32 months, there was no sign of recurrence. We found that early diagnosis together with thorough surgical treatment is currently the most effective approach to prolong the survival time of patients. In addition, postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy could be alternative options to benefit patients.",

Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor. Previous studies have demonstrated a synergistic interaction between trastuzumab and 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin in HER2-positive gastric cancer cells. However, it is unclear whether it is rational to combine trastuzumab with other chemotherapy regimens in clinical practice. We evaluated the growth inhibitory effects of combinations of trastuzumab and cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs in HER2-positive gastric cancer cell lines. HER2 protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting in five gastric cancer cell lines. MTT assays were performed to evaluate the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab and four chemotherapeutic agents, epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and docetaxel, both alone and in combination. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the synergistic interactions of trastuzumab and chemotherapeutic agent treatment, the protein levels of phospho-protein kinase B (pAkt) were determined by Western blotting. We showed that trastuzumab synergizes with the cytotoxic effect of epirubicin in HER2-positive gastric cancer cells. Further investigation showed that the trastuzumab-epirubicin combination decreased the expression of pAkt. Altogether, our results provide preclinical evidence for the optimization of this combination regimen in the treatment of HER2-positive gastric cancer patients.",

Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to measure cell proliferation. Annexin V/ PI kit and TUNEL assay were carried out to test cell apoptosis. Knockdown of TRIM52 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Glucose uptake, lactate, and ATP production were depressed after TRIM52 silencing. Furthermore, loss of TRIM52 decreased the levels of pyruvate kinase isozyme M2, glucose transporter protein 1, and p-STAT3. Overexpression of TRIM52 showed effects that were opposite as those of TRIM52 knockdown; these effects were alleviated by AG490, which is an inhibitor of STAT3. In addition, TRIM52 knockdown inhibited tumorigenesis in a xenograft mouse model. Finally, we found that high level of TRIM52 expression predicted poor prognosis.

The PCR-RFLP was applied to detect the MTHFR C677T genotypes. Biochemical analyses of seminal fluid, homocysteine, and sex hormones were determined with histological and IHC examination of testicular tissue. Morphometric measurements and a TUNEL assay of seminiferous tubules were also performed. The results revealed a significant increase in homocysteine and sperm abnormalities, while sex hormones, sperm count and motility decreased significantly in the TT genotype compared with the CC genotype. Also, G2 displayed a significant increase in homocysteine and sperm abnormalities, with a significant decrease in sex hormones, sperm count and motility as compared to the G1 and G3. In conclusion, MTHFR 677C > T polymorphism is a genetic risk factor for male infertility and folic acid has a potential role in the treatment of male infertility.",

This study aims to investigate the role of hypoxia on functional effects in MDSPCs. In this study, MDSPCs were isolated from skeletal muscles of limbs; meanwhile, the flow cytometry analysis, immunocytochemistry and multilineage differentiation were performed to characterize MDSPCs. We set cultured MDSPCs in a hypoxic condition with 3% oxygen. The quantitative RT–PCR results showed that hypoxia inhibits myogenic differentiation genes expression, while it is beneficial for the stemness and pro-angiogenic genes. The CCK-8, flow cytometry, Hoechst 33342 and trypan blue dye assays revealed that hypoxia promotes survival and reduces apoptotic cells from oxidative stress damage. The western blot analysis indicated increased expression of HIF-1α and its downstream proteins by hypoxia. Moreover, the angiogenesis assay showed that condition media extracted from hypoxia-treated MDSPCs support endothelial cells’ survival, migration and tube formation in vitro. The cultured cells under hypoxia appear as a salutary strategy to improve the survival and stemness of MDSPCs and enhance angiogenesis capacity in tissue injury repair and reconstruction applications.Abbreviations: MDSPCs, Muscle-derived stem/progenitor cells; ESCs, embryonic stem cells; PPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cells; ACSs, adult stem cells; PNI, Peripheral nerve injuries; BMSCs, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; NSCs, neural stem cells; ADSCs, adipose-derived stem cells; HIF-1α; Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; SDF-1, stromal-derived factor 1; PM, proliferation media; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MYHC, Myosin heavy chain; CCK-8, cell counting kit-8; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; CM, conditioned media; CON, control group; qPCR, Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; MRL/MpJ, Murphy Roths Large",

However, the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanisms of Pru in inflammatory bowel disease have not been previously investigated. This study aimed to explore the protective action of Pru on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis by network pharmacology and experimental validation.Methods: The corresponding genes of Pru were predicted using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and SwissTargetPrediction. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control rats and DSS-induced colitis rats were identified from the microarray profile GSE54005. Cytoscape software was used to visualize the protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of overlapped targets. Besides, an animal experiment was performed to verify the therapeutic effect of Pru on colitis.Results: 21 potential targets related to colitis treated by Pru were identified. The topological analysis revealed that Tnf, Il6, and Il1b were the key genes. The KEGG and GO enrichment analyses showed that key targets were enriched in the inflammatory bowel disease, IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, regulation of inflammatory response, and acute inflammatory response. The in vivo experiment revealed that Pru improves pathological injury and alleviated colitis symptoms via the regulation of Tnf, Il6, and Il1b, which were involved in the acute inflammatory response.Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that Pru alleviates colitis symptoms through the regulation of inflammatory response, which provides a scientific basis for Pru in preventing and treating colitis.",

Those levels with a positive SedSign were further analyzed relative to those with a negative SedSign. There was no significant difference between the two groups for the cross-sectional area (CSA) or the posteroanterior diameter (PAD). In contrast, there was a significant difference between the groups for the grade of degenerative facet joint (DFJ) (p < 0.05), the thickness of ligamentum flavum (TLF) (p < 0.01), and the cross-sectional area difference (CSAD) (p < 0.01).

It can pass through typical mosquito netting, so repellents are an important control measure against it. This project sought to identify spatial repellents from plants traditionally used by Taiwanese Aboriginal peoples as insect repellents. Fresh plant leaves were collected, frozen, and powdered, and essential oils extracted using hexane then ethyl acetate as solvents. Some commercial oils were also used. The extracts were tested against lab-reared F. taiwana using a Y-tube olfactometer. The composition of the extracts was identified using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Commercial citronella, lavender, and Formosan cypress oils were effective repellents, as were lab-made capillary wormwood and camphor oils. Knockdown was detected in commercial clove leaf, rosemary, common wormwood, and cajuput oils. The oil composition data is the first for many of the Taiwanese plants, many of which contained repellent compounds like caryophyllene, α-pinene, and germacrene D. The results agreed with previous studies on the effects of some plants but differed on others, possibly due differences in plant chemotype, extraction method, and oil concentrations.Key Policy Highlights Botanical oils may have some effect as personal repellents against Forcipomyia taiwana.Commercially available oils show the most promise.Certain endangered trees show promise as sources of repellents, so their conservation should be prioritized.",

    "abstract": "The potential advantages of sleep concerning suppressing cytokine storms and inflammation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on its immunopathogenesis are summarized in the current study. COVID-19 as a global pandemic in the past months has afflicted many people. Clinical properties, pathology, and the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder caused by coronaviruses or other pathogens are evidence implying the probable contribution of oxidation, excessive inflammation, and excessive immune response, particularly cytokine storm, to the pathology of COVID-19. According to findings by experimental and clinical research on animals and in humans, sleep loss impairs immune function. Sleep loss strongly influences peripheral levels of the immune response's inflammatory mediators, which is accomplished by the generation of various hormones and mediators during sleep. There are a large number of studies supporting the presence of reciprocal regulation between low-intensity inflammatory response and sleep. By improving sleep quality and at the same time adjusting the circadian rhythm, it may be possible to prevent infections and boost immunity. As a result, sufficient (or even more) sleep duration may lower susceptibility to COVID-19 infection as well as increase antibody levels.",

Recent studies have found that PNO1 is involved in the progression of a variety of tumors and is highly expressed in colorectal, lung, esophageal, glioma, and breast cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. In tumors, PNO1 mainly promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and autophagy and inhibits apoptosis by regulating the P53 pathway, FAK/AKT pathway, Notch signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. The high expression of PNO1 in various tumors may be reduced by the regulation of early B cell factor 1 (EBF1), transcription factor MYC, miR-340-5p, and the drug celecoxib inhibiting tumor proliferation, invasion and migration, and autophagy, promoting apoptosis. This article reviews the structure and function of PNO1, related molecular pathways, and its regulatory role in tumor formation and discusses its possibility as a molecular target for tumor therapy.",

Methods: Forty eyes of 40 uveitis patients in the acute phase, 12 eyes of 12 patients with inactive uveitis and 21 eyes of 21 healthy controls were included in this study. RPCvd% and pRNFL thickness in different regions were automatically measured and calculated by OCTA. Correlation between RPCvd% and pRNFL was assessed. Results: RPCvd% was significantly higher in uveitis-inactive eyes than in active eyes in the inferior quadrant (p = 0.036), whole image (p = 0.041) and inferior nasal (p = 0.001) sector. The RPCvd% in active uveitis eyes was lower compared to healthy eyes in the inside disc sector (p = 0.026). pRNFL was notably greater in the active group compared to the healthy group. Positive correlations were identified between pRNFL and RPCvd% both in active and inactive uveitis eyes. Conclusions: Compared with active uveitis, papillary microcirculation showed a significant improvement in inactive uveitis eyes (anterior or pan-uveitis). RPCvd% may serve as a sensitive indicator to supervising uveitis progression and treatment response using OCTA.",

A total of 801, 66 and 30 genes were silenced in 10th, 20th and 30th generation cells; 8 genes were silenced in 10th and 20th generation cells but not in 30th generation cells; 14 genes were silenced in 30th and 10th generation cells but not in 20th generation cells; and one gene was silenced in 20th and 30th generation cells but not in 10th generation cells. TRPV1 and SOD2 genes were methylated and their gene expression levels were significantly lower in 30th generation 16HBE cells treated with GMA compared to uninduced control cells (P < 0.05). The expression levels of DNA methylation-silenced genes were altered throughout the GMA-induced malignant transformation of 16HBE cells.

The current study investigated the composition and functions of rhizosphere bacteria as well as soil enzyme activity under different Al stress conditions. The effect of soil pH, soil enzyme activities, the diversity and structure of the rhizosphere bacterial population under various Al concentrations were studied by the pot experiment. All analyses demonstrated that substantial alterations in the activity of soil enzymes and the composition of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere could only be seen under conditions of extreme Al stress. Soil enzymes were more concentrated in Al concentrations of 100, 150 and 250 µM, respectively. More than 82,000 valid reads were obtained for each replicate, and the abundance of certain genera in the aluminium treated groups were greater than the control group. Lower Al stress attracted Al-tolerant bacteria such as Burkholderia to increase Al stress resistance. These findings revealed that soil enzyme activities and the structure of the rhizosphere bacterial population in tea orchard soil provided tolerance or resistance capability to tea plants for their development under Al stress.",

The direct effect of L. wallichii on AP remains unknown.Methods: AP animal model was constructed by intraperitoneal injection of caerulein in male Sprague–Dawley rats. L. wallichii extracts were used to treat rats with AP. Then, tissue injury was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Serum indicators, including amylase, lipase, KL-6, creatinine and urea, were measured by commercial kits. GC/MS-based metabolomics was utilized to characterize the metabolome.Results: Intraperitoneal injection of L. wallichii extracts protected against lung, liver, and kidney injury in rats with caerulein-induced AP. GC/MS-based metabolomics analysis revealed that L. wallichii treatment could restore caerulein-induced alteration of the abundance of most metabolites. These differential metabolites enriched twelve metabolic pathways that were able to be reprogramed by L. wallichii administration. L. wallichii impacted arginine metabolism by inhibiting arginase expression and activity. Inhibition of arginase by S-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine (BEC) could relieve caerulein-induced AP, suggesting that suppression of arginase is a potential mechanism for L. wallichii to ameliorate AP.Conclusion: Our data provide the inter-relationship between metabolic reprograming and anti-AP effects of L. wallichii extracts in rats, and highlight the potential of metabolic reprograming against AP pathogenesis.",

Recent studies have explored the involvement of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in diabetes, but its specific role in DPN development remains unclear. To investigate the association between lncRNAs and DPN, we conducted comprehensive bioinformatics analyses. We obtained gene expression data from the sciatic nerve of 8-week-old and 24-week-old diabetic mice from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify co-expression modules and hub differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and other bioinformatics methods were used to establish the biological processes and functions of the differentially expressed RNAs related to DPN. The identified hub genes were validated using an animal model of DPN and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Two lncRNAs (DIO3OS and A530053G22Rik) and three mRNAs (FGF18, DUSP3, and DUSP9) were identified as potential DPN-related genes, potentially affecting DPN through the MAPK pathway. Five hub genes were identified as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of DPN, based on the GEO database.",

Cell therapy to provide a source of myogenic stem cells that repopulate the lost muscle fibers is an attractive option to treat skeletal muscle injury or dystrophy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the potential to be an ideal source of donor muscle cells. This review will discuss major research applications of iPSCs to facilitate skeletal muscle repair, which involve myogenic cell transplantation, in vitro modeling of normal and dystrophic muscle tissue, and drug screening protocols. Recent advances in these fields will be discussed in this review, such as the production of neuromuscular junctions between muscle fibers and motor neurons, along with an overview of the problems that currently prevent iPSCs from being a clinically valid source of transplantable skeletal muscle stem cells. Potential future applications of iPSCs to enhance skeletal muscle regeneration will also be discussed.",

Functional enrichment, protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis, drug prediction, and survival analysis were performed. Key gene-drug interactions were also predicted. Finally, hub genes expression in an OC cell line (SKOV3) was verified using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Totally 354 overlapping DEGs were identified. PPI network revealed genes such as CCL5 and CXCR4 with higher degrees, which were mainly involved in chemokine-related functions. CCND1, CCNE1, CXCL10, ERBB4, LPAR3, and SST were correlated with prognosis of OC patients. Among them, CXCL10 was considered as an independent prognostic factor.

The summary sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of admission serum CAPAP were 0.86 (95%CI: 0.76-0.93), 0.78 (95%CI: 0.68-0.85), 3.89 (95%CI: 2.56-5.91), 0.18 (95%CI: 0.09-0.33), 18.56 (95%CI: 6.99-49.30), and 0.90 (95%CI: 0.87-0.92), respectively; these values for admission urine CAPAP were 0.82 (95%CI: 0.50-0.95), 0.78 (95%CI: 0.68-0.86), 3.75 (95%CI: 2.40-5.85), 0.23 (95%CI: 0.07-0.79), 9.87 (95%CI: 3.71-26.22), and 0.84 (95%CI: 0.80-0.87), respectively. There were no significant differences between admission serum and urine CAPAP in sensitivity (1.05, 95%CI: 0.75-1.47; P = 0.781), specificity (1.00, 95%CI: 0.85-1.18; P = 1.000), PLR (1.04, 95%CI: 0.56-1.91; P = 0.906), NLR (0.78, 95%CI: 0.20-3.10; P = 0.727), and DOR (1.88, 95%CI: 0.47-7.49; P = 0.370). The AUC of serum CAPAP (1.07, 95%: 1.02-1.13; P = 0.007) was higher than that of urine CAPAP in predicting acute pancreatitis severity. Both admission serum and urine CAPAP had moderate predictive values for assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis.",

This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of propofol on the proliferation and invasion of EM by regulating miR-9-5p/TGFBI. The proliferation and invasion of ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) were determined by MTT assay and Transwell assay, respectively. Real-time PCR was applied for the evaluation of miR-9-5p and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced gene (TGFBI) mRNA level in ESCs. Western blot was used to examine the protein level of TGFBI protein (TGFBIp) in ESCs. The relation between miR-9-5p and TGFBI was predicted by TargetScan 7.1 and verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. Propofol reduced cell proliferation and invasion, while induced miR-9-5p level and reduced TGFBI/TGFBIp level in ectopic ESCs. Additionally, in ectopic ESCs from patients with EM, miR-9-5p was lower, while TGFBI and TGFBIp were higher than those from eutopic endometrium and normal endometrium from patients with hysteromyoma. Moreover, propofol reduced proliferation and invasion in ectopic ESCs, which was realized by the regulation of miR-9-5p/TGFBI.",

Therefore, cell replacement therapy with good application prospects has become a hot spot in biomedical research. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are promising sources of cells with unlimited proliferation ability and multiple differentiation potential. The purpose of this study was to use these characteristics of hESCs to obtain a large number of differentiated and stable neural stem cells (NSCs) and provide potential tissue engineering materials for the treatment of neurological diseases. Cultured on low adhesion plate for 4 days in vitro, the hESCs can differentiate into suspended embryoid bodies (EBs). After further culture of EBs for 4 days, high-purity Nestin-positive NSCs with typical rosette structure can be induced, and these cells can further differentiate into a variety of mature nerve cells. Meanwhile, hESCs could form in vivo typical teratomas that contained rosette structures. Our results indicated that hESCs had the ability to differentiate into rosette NSCs both in vitro and in vivo, and the bioactive rosettes are of great significance to understanding the mechanism of neural development and studying the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Approximately 99% of adherent cells were transformed into giant, malformed, multinucleated cells with mitotic catastrophe. One week after radiation was ceased, cells with normal morphology were observed adjacent to the cells with mitotic catastrophe, and over time, they formed clones.

Our objective was to assess the effects of TPF on pressure ulcers in a mouse model of cutaneous ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Cutaneous I/R injury was created by trapping the dorsal skin between two magnetic disks for 12 h, followed by disk removal. TPF administration in I/R areas at the beginning of reperfusion significantly inhibited the formation of pressure ulcers. The number of neutrophils and M1 macrophages and the levels of proinflammatory mediators MCP-1, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the wound area were reduced upon TPF treatment. Collagen synthesis and α-SMA-positive microvessel density significantly increased in the wounds of TPF-treated mice. Additionally, TPF inhibited cutaneous I/R injury-induced formation and accumulation of apoptotic cells. Moreover, TPF increased the expression of filaggrin and involucrin. In conclusion, TPF may inhibit cutaneous I/R injury-induced formation of pressure ulcers by regulating inflammation, collagen production, angiogenesis, and skin barrier restoration. Therefore, exogenous application of TPF might have therapeutic potential with respect to cutaneous I/R injuries like decubitus ulcers.",

The study was directed toward exploring the effects of miR-223 on LC proliferation and apoptosis. Dual luciferase reporter assay (DLRA) was carried out to verify the direct relationship of TLR4 mRNA 3′-UTR and miR-223-3p. HepG2 cells subsequently were transfected with miR-223 mimics. MTT assay and flow cytometric assay were carried out to evaluate proliferation and cell death, respectively. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) transcription and translation were examined via qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. We observed that the miR-223 expression in LC tissues was inhibited, accompanied by reinforced TLR4 expression. Excessive miR-223 expression noticeably inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in HepG2 and Bel-7402 HCC cell lines. Additionally, knockdown of TLR4 expression could suppress cell growth and promote apoptosis in HepG2 and Bel-7402 HCC cell lines. Moreover, TLR4 expression was suppressed via miR-223 transfection. T DLRA verified that miR-223 directly targeted TLR4. TLR4 over-expression canceled the effects of miR-223 on LC proliferation and apoptosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that miR-223 is an inhibitor of malignancy and participates in the inhibition of malignancy generation and reinforcement of LC cell death by targeting TLR4.",

The aim of our study is to identify pivotal genes related to the pathogenesis and prognosis of CRC. We integrated five microarray datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed with the limma package. DAVID and OmicShare tools were used for Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analysis. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed. The prognostic analysis of hub genes was performed through Kaplan Meier-plotter. Finally, potential drugs were predicted in the CMap database. Through five microarray datasets, a total of 90 DEGs were detected including 54 up-regulated and 36 down-regulated genes. Biological process analysis showed DEGs were mainly enriched in positive regulation of neutrophil chemotaxis, chemokine-mediated signaling pathway, and bicarbonate transport. Signaling pathway analysis indicated that DEGs played a vital in proximal tubule bicarbonate reclamation, cell cycle and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation. The GEPIA database confirmed that overexpression levels of hub genes were significantly associated with better survival of patients. Finally, the 20 most significant small molecules were obtained based on the CMap database. Our study has identified novel candidate biomarkers, pathways, and kinases associated with CRC prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Restenosis formation is initiated from intimal hyperplasia when arterial stretch and injury exist. In this study, we examined the role of CDKN1A-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (CIZ1) in neointimal hyperplasia in injured arteries. CIZ1 protein was up-regulated, and p21Cip1/Waf1 (p21) was down-regulated in the neointimal hyperplasia from a mouse femoral artery wire-injury model. In vitro, proliferation and migration were reduced in vascular smooth muscle cells transformed with Ciz1-shRNA lentiviral particles. In addition, p21 expression is increased, and MMP9 expression is decreased in vascular smooth muscle cells with CIZ1 knockdown. These data imply that CIZ1 might be a novel repressor of neointimal lesion formation caused by interventional therapy.",

    "abstract": "B7 family members and their receptors have been confirmed to participate in T cell response signaling through the induction of immunosuppressive effects. The V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) is expressed in myeloid cells as well as T lymphocytes and plays a crucial role in immune responses. In this study, the phage display technique was employed to isolate specific antibodies targeting VISTA in chickens. In in vitro experiments, VISTA could trigger the inhibition of T-cell activation through interaction during binding. However, isolated single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) effectively inhibited immune cells from producing exhaustion responses, freeing the T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from inhibition and allowing them to remain activated. In addition, the isolated scFvs can block the interaction between VISTA and the VSIG3 ligand. Further analysis on one scFv VS10 revealed that a significant insertion mutation occurred at the CDR3 of the VH domain compared to the chicken germline sequence. Finally, the complex structures of scFv VS10 and VISTA were simulated using molecular docking, and the interaction produced was analyzed. The experimental results support the applicability of VISTA as a target for immune checkpoints and contribute to explaining geometric structures and properties in chicken antibodies.",

Many of its critical actions are believed to be mediated by activation of corresponding transcription factors. Here I attempt to reveal signaling cascades that relay NGF stimulation to NFAT, a family of Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent transcription factors that are implicated in playing a pivotal role in neuronal development and survival, and pain sensation. With a luciferase gene reporter assay, it was confirmed that NGF can trigger NFAT-dependent gene expression in PC12 cells. Subsequent research with pharmacological tools uncovers that this effect was mediated by the TrkA-MEK1/2 pathway. Furthermore, it was determined that NFATc3 is the predominant isoform by calculating an absolute copy number of each NFAT isoform with quantitative PCR. Taken together, it is proposed that elucidating cellular connections linking NGF and NFAT may help reveal novel therapeutic targets, which can be exploited to devise innovative remedies for the treatment of NGF and NFAT-associated clinical disorders such as anomalous neuronal development and hyperalgesia.",

Unsupervised clustering was performed to identify suitable subtypes, followed by a correlation analysis of clinical factors. Gene set variation analysis, immune infiltration, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were investigated between subtypes, followed by functional enrichment for DEGs. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen DEGs to construct a prognostic model. Of the 53 ferroptosis-related genes identified in GAC, two ferroptosis-related molecular subtypes were further examined. These two subtypes showed significant differences in the distribution of histological grades and KEGG pathways. In addition, tumor infiltration of 10 immune cells, including Tregs and natural killer cells, was significantly different between the two subtypes. A total of 660 DEGs were identified between these two subtypes and ultimately 12 genes associated with prognosis, including GPX3, SNCG, DUSP1, and FBN1, were selected by LASSO to construct a prognostic risk model. Survival analysis showed that this model had better prognostic value. Finally, regression analysis showed that the risk score was an independent prognostic indicator of GAC. In summary, two ferroptosis-related molecular subtypes that were associated with the histological grade and tumor immune infiltration were identified. The 12 gene-based risk model had an independent value for predicting GAC prognosis.",

The differentially expressed- mRNAs (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) between FTD-resistant and parental cell lines were screened. Next, the DEGs-related miRNAs were predicted and then DEGs-DEMs network was constructed, followed by functional enrichment analysis and protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Meanwhile, the gene–drug interactions were identified. Finally, the prognostic significance of key genes was evaluated using survival analysis. A total of 23 DEMs and 928 DEGs were screened between FTD-resistant and CRC parental cells. The DEMs-DEGs network revealed that miRNAs such as hsa-miR-3714 and hsa-miR-3678-3p with higher degrees, and PPI network indicated that genes like HDAC5, ETV6, CCNF, SREBF1, and LDLR might be recognized as hub genes. Moreover, we observed that CCNF, HDAC5, ETV6, and SREBF1 were associated with the overall survival or disease-free survival of patients with CRC. These findings might provide an insight into potential therapeutic targets and druggable genes for FTD-resistant in patients with CRC.",

We identified 519 proteins from 2,628 peptides, the expression of 158 of which differed significantly between short-term captive and wild seals. In addition, 140 proteins were identified as being differentially expressed between short-term and long-term captive seals, whereas 235 proteins were differentially expressed between the wild and long-term captive groups (p < 0.05). In wild seal pups, proteins associated with the maintenance of cardiomyocyte cell stability and integrity, protection of the heart, and prevention of anemia were upregulated, reflecting the high stress and energetic costs associated with movement and foraging. In addition, significant differences were detected among the three groups with respect to immune-related proteins. The results of this study advance our current understanding of protein expression in spotted seals and provide data that will contribute to the future conservation of this species.",

Differential analysis revealed 341 DEGs between the groups, and KEGG analysis demonstrated that these positively related genes in the high-risk group were mainly involved in chemical synaptic transmission pathway modulation and trans-synaptic signaling pathway regulation. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that the high-risk patients had higher proportions of M1 macrophages and T+ CD4 cells, but a lower proportion of M2 macrophages than that of the low-risk group.

Expression patterns of hub genes were confirmed by quantitative RT–PCR.Results: A total of 1109 DEGs were identified between MU and para-cancerous scar tissues, including 471 upregulated and 638 downregulated genes. These DEGs mainly participated in extracellular matrix organization-related pathway, cytokine−cytokine receptor interaction, cytokine activity, and IL-17 signalling pathway. GSEA revealed 48 significantly altered pathways. Four common pathways were identified in different enrichment analyses, including PPAR signalling pathway. Among the genes in the PPAR pathway, 18 DEGs were found.

A rat model of ovulation induction was constructed using horse serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin, and then acupuncture was used to treat the model rats at Guanyuan and Sanyinjiao points. Hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining, the endometrial thickness, and enlargement of uterine cavity were determined to evaluate the effects of acupuncture on the uterus of ovulation induction rats. Meanwhile, the uterus tissues were sent for gene microarray analyses. Acupuncture enhanced the endometrial receptivity of ovulation induction rats. Gene microarray showed that 189 overlapped differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and these overlapped DEGs were divided into four clusters by Mfuzz algorithm. Afterwards, interaction networks containing 842 interaction pairs were established, and the DEGs in the interaction networks were significantly enriched in 20 BP and 10 KEGG pathways, including wound healing, response to glucocorticoid, TNF signaling pathway, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism.

    "abstract": "We aimed to identify potential molecular biomarkers through integrated analysis of microbiome and transcriptome data in colon cancer. Microbiome, transcriptome, and clinical phenotype data were downloaded from TCMA and TCGA databases. Intestinal flora subtypes were identified, followed by screening feature genes of each subtype. Univariate and LASSO Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify optimal prognostic genes to establish prognostic model. Survival, clinical phenotypes, pathways, and immune infiltration within different risk groups were compared. Three intestinal flora subtypes were identified: Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes subtypes. Bacteroidetes subtype tended to have worse survival. Feature genes of Bacteroidetes subtype were mainly implicated in immune-related functional terms, whereas those of Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria subtypes were mainly implicated in functions associated with inflammatory response and transcription, respectively. LASSO Cox regression identified 6 optimal prognostic genes: CSF1R, HLA-DOA, NOS3, HOXB4, PLA1A, and RPL3, to establish prognostic risk model. High-risk patients were associated with worse survival and had high proportions of Bacteroidetes subtype and high immune infiltration. Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes largely dominated the gut microbial flora in colon cancer patients. Prognostic model based on feature genes of intestinal flora subtypes can predict survival in colon cancer.",

    "abstract": "Background: Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor, but its therapeutic effect is not very ideal up to now. The point of this study was to recognize the potential gene involved in lower-grade glioma (LGG) and to promote the treatment and prognosis for LGG patients. Method: During the investigation, we first studied the differential expression and the survival analysis of GNG5 in patients with glioma, LGG, and GBM, respectively. Then, independent prognostic analysis, the clinical relevance characteristics and the differential expressed genes (DEGs) were also evaluated. In addition, Metascape and GSEA analyses were carried out to achieve potential mechanism. Co-expression and immune infiltration analysis were finally conducted. Results: The results indicated that GNG5 as an independent prognostic indicator was negatively associated with the overall survival of LGG patients. Metascape and GSEA analyses showed that GNG5 may participate in complement and coagulation cascades pathway. The co-expression analysis was concluded that GNG5 was positively correlated with the following factors: C4B, PLAU, C1R, C1QC, C4A, SERPINA1, C1QB, CFI, C3. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the highly expression of GNG5 in LGG may lead to poor prognosis. Besides, our research also revealed that GNG5 may be a promising immune-related biomarker for LGG patients.",

TCMSP, OMIM and GeneCards databases were used to obtain active ingredients of TwHF to predict related targets of TwHF and ALL. Cytoscape and STRING databases were used to construct Ingredient-target-disease and PPI networks, respectively. Enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG was conducted by Bioconductor database. Molecular docking was performed using the Autodock platform to predict the binding of the active components to key action targets.CCK-8 assay was performed to measure the effects of drugs on the proliferation of ALL cells. The ingredient-target-disease network contained 16 compounds and 43 corresponding targets. Key targets included VEGFA, CASP3, RELA, ESR1, BCL2, and MAPK8. There were 79 GO items in the GO enrichment analysis (p < .05) and 91 signalling pathways (p < .05) in KEGG primarily including tumour necrosis factor signalling pathway and apoptosis pathway. Molecular docking results showed that triptolide, kaempferol and other phytocompounds had a high affinity for the corresponding targets.CCK-8 assay suggested that triptolide and kaempferol have anti-proliferative effects on ALL cells. Triptolide, kaempferol and other active ingredients from TwHF may exert therapeutic effects on ALL through multiple pathways and targets.Highlights There are 43 potential action targets of TwHF for ALL treatments, among which VEGFA and CASP3 are the core genes.16 active ingredients including triptolide and kaempferol play a role in the treatment of leukaemia.The bioactive components of TwHF can treat the ALL by modulating biological processes such as nuclear receptor activity and biological pathways such as apoptosis pathway and tumour necrosis factor signalling pathway.Triptolide and kaempferol significantly inhibited the viability of Jurkat, MOLT-4 and Nalm-6 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.ALL, Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; BCL2, B lymphocyte tumor-2 gene; CASP3, Caspase-3; CCK-8, cell counting kit 8; DL, Drug-likeness; ESR1, estrogen receptor 1; MAPK8, mitogen-activated protein kinase 8; OB, Oral bioavailability; OD, optical density; PPI, protein–protein interaction; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; SD, standard deviation; TwHF, Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F; Triptolide: Kaempferol; TCMSP, Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology; T-ALL, T-cell Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; TRAIL, Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; TPL, Triptolide; VEGFA, vascular endothelial growth factor A gene.",

Presently, chemotherapy is the main treatment, but the therapeutic effect is not satisfactory due to drug resistance. Feiyanning decoction (FYN), a widely used Chinese Tradition Medicine (TCM), shows a good effect on the treatment of lung cancer. However, the underlying mechanism seems unclear. In this study, FYN was applied to cisplatin-resistant A549 cell line. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and Annexin V/PI kit. Xenograft mouse model was constructed to analyze the tumor growth. The results showed that FYN inhibited cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Downregulated of Bcl-2 and upregulated of HEATR1, TAp73, p53 and Bax were observed after treatment with FYN. Interestingly, all these effects induced by FYN were alleviated by HEATR1 overexpression in A549/DDP cells. Furthermore, FYN played a synergistic effect with cisplatin on the increase of cell apoptosis in vitro and the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, FYN played a synergistic effect with cisplatin on the inhibition of cell viability in NSCLC via negatively regulating HEATR1.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS), a common bone malignancy, is highly metastatic and featured by poor prognosis. SUMOylation is deeply involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE) inhibitor has been found to play an anti-proliferative role in multiple cancers. However, their functions in osteosarcoma remain unknown. Based on this, it was hypothesized that ML792, an SAE inhibitor, might be an anti-tumor candidate against osteosarcoma in this paper. The role of ML792 in the treatment of osteosarcoma was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results showed ML792 significantly arrested human osteosarcoma cells (HOCs) at the G2/M phase, inhibited the proliferation of HOCs, and elicited apoptosis. To better assess the inhibitory role of ML792 in human osteosarcoma, we induced HOCs with TGF-β1. Our study showed that ML792 significantly suppressed the migration, invasion, and EMT of HOCs induced by TGF-β1. Moreover, ML792 inhibited TGF-β1-induced phosphatidylinositol- 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT activation, as well as Smad2/3 phosphorylation in HOCs. In vivo, ML792 inhibits the growth of osteosarcoma. Thus, ML792 is a promising new antitumor agent to suppress the progress of OS cells undergoing proliferation and EMT by targeting the PI3K/Akt and TGF-β1/Smad pathway and may prevent or reduce the growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma.",

    "abstract": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) might be the last resort for some patients with cardiac or cardiorespiratory failure. Although ECMO has improved survival rates, it is associated with neurocognitive complications post-recovery. Neurocognitive complications, including verbal, learning, and memory deficits, decrease quality of life and increase burden on society and families. Enormous evidence has proven that neuronal plasticity of the central nervous system accounts for neurocognitive complications. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal plasticity in ECMO remain unclear. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is inevitable after ECMO therapy. SIRS in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been proven to be associated with nerve injury. Moreover, inflammatory mediators mediate the activation of microglia, astroglia, and other cells that affect synaptic plasticity. This review discusses the presumptive effects of upregulated inflammatory factors and activation in non-neuronal cells on neuronal structural and functional plasticity in ECMO. Additionally, the review improves our understanding of these neuronal mechanisms and identifies potential targets that can enhance the ability of prophylaxis and treatment for neurocognitive complications after ECMO therapy.",

Although sarcomeric gene mutations can explain many HCM cases, the genetic basis of approximately half of HCM cases remains elusive. Here, we report the case of a 30-year-old woman with HCM after imaging and pathological examinations. We identified a novel mutation in a pathogenic gene from the HCM patient through whole-exome sequencing. A heterozygous missense mutation in exon 1 of the α-tropomyosin (TPM1) gene (NM_000366.5:exon1:c.71A > G) was found based on patient sequencing data. The mutation resulted in glutamine replacing arginine (p.Gln24Arg). This mutation was expected to cause significant and deleterious changes in the structure of the TPM1 protein. Therefore, according to pathogenicity assessment guidelines, the mutation was considered likely pathogenic. We found that most of these mutations are related to cardiomyopathy and majority of them are in exon 1 and are missense mutations. TPM1 mutations are thus a common cause of HCM and other congenital heart defects. Thus, a novel missense variant, p.Gln24Arg, in the TPM1 gene is associated with the autosomal dominant disease HCM. These results expand the knowledge spectrum of TPM1 gene function.",

We investigated the effect of Six-ingredient-Xiao-qing-long decoction (SXD) on the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-stimulated hASMC. Cell viability and migration of TGF-β1-induced hASMC were determined by CCK-8 and transwell assays. The expressions of FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51), protein kinase B (AKT), p-AKT were determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting. In addition, FKBP51 overexpression (oeFKBP51) and FKBP51 knockdown (siFKBP51) were carried out to further confirm the results. SXD dose-dependently suppressed the cell proliferation and migration of TGF-β1-induced hASMC. TGF-β1 markedly inhibited the mRNA and protein levels of FKBP51 in a time-dependent manner. Nevertheless, compared to the TGF-β1 group, SXD increased the expression of FKBP51 while suppressed p-AKT. Moreover, both oeFKBP51 and SXD reduced the migration ability of TGF-β1-induced hASMC, as well as elevated the expressions of FKBP51 but decreased p-AKT. Finally, siFKBP51 promoted cell migration and caused the up-regulation of p-AKT in hASMC, but SXD could reverse these changes. SXD could suppress the proliferation and migration of hASMC via activating FKBP51/AKT signaling, which may provide a novel possible target for child asthma therapy.

Few reliable biomarkers have been established despite illustration of the molecular mechanisms of GISTs development. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (lncRNA PVT1) is a tumor regulator in many cancers. The goal of our research was to investigate the level and biological function of PVT1 in GIST-882 and GIST-T1 cells. The relative expression of PVT1 was higher in the GISTs cells. Down-regulation of PVT1 has shown that suppressed the proliferation and migration abilities of GISTs cells, and significantly stimulated cell apoptosis. Furthermore, western blot assay confirmed that knockdown of PVT1 obviously reduced the expression of CCND1, CCNB1, CDK6, PIK3CA, p-AKT, Rictor, mSIN1 and mLST8. The results implicated that PTV1 may regulate the progression of GISTs cells through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In conclusion, our study provides the evidence that PVT1 plays a vital oncogenic role in GISTs cells, and is a potential prognostic biomarker of recurrence after surgical procedures of GISTs. This highlights the possible of PVT1 serve as a therapeutic target for GISTs treatment.",

Indeed, there are pathological changes in the brain, which include a reduction in the volume of the brain, metabolic alterations, alterations in the functional connectivity, dysregulation of angiogenesis and changes in the apparent axon density along with orientation dispersion. The management of neural abnormalities depends on the type of symptoms observed in these patients. There have been limited studies that have focused on identifying the interventions that may limit the impact of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. It has been reported that dexmedetomidine, α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, produces neuroprotection in infants undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease. Moreover, there have been some studies focusing on the impact of mode of feeding, anticoagulation, and effect of other anesthetics on the neurodevelopmental changes in congenital heart disease pediatrics.

Gene expression levels were analysed by a microarray platform. The obtained gene-set data were used for biological pathway analysis by Reactome functional network clustering. Over 3000 probes were differentially modulated by dexamethasone in wild-type (WT) and AT fibroblasts. Consequently, the biological pathways induced by dexamethasone treatment also differed between the two samples. Some of the pathways were the same as those normally altered in AT compared to WT cells. Our results were consistent with earlier studies on HDAC4 and DDIT4 dynamics. The 30-day low dose dexamethasone treatment induced differential gene expression in AT and WT cells, leading to the partial recovery of genes that are usually dysregulated in AT. This is probably due to glucocorticoid receptor diversity in AT, which is likely genetically imprinted in AT, thus accounting for the differential response of AT cells to dexamethasone treatment.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is one of the most significant independent risk factors that can negatively affect prostate cancer (PCa) patients. However, the exact mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To illustrate the mechanisms underlying PCa metastasis, we conducted a series of integrated bioinformatics analyses. The essential genes involved in PCa metastasis were obtained by analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between metastatic PCa and localized PCa. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed for functional annotation. Protein–protein interaction networks were constructed for hub gene selection. Three transcription factor genes (FOS, CENPA, and FOXM1) were identiﬁed by integrating the hub genes with human transcription factors from The Human Transcription Factors database. Moreover, expression validation and prognostic analysis of the three transcription factor genes were carried out on GEO, TCGA, GEPIA, and the Human Protein Atlas, respectively. Further verification showed that expression variation of the three transcription factor genes existed between metastatic PCa and localized PCa as well as between localized PCa and normal prostate. In addition, different expressions of the three transcription factor genes were associated with the prognosis of localized PCa. In summary, the three transcription factor genes can serve as potential prognostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets for PCa.Abbreviations: PCa: prostate cancer; DEGs: differentially expressed genes; TFs: transcription factors; GEO: Gene Expression Omnibus; FC: fold change; DAVID: Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery; GO: Gene Ontology; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; BP: biological process; CC: cell component; MF: molecular function; PPI: protein–protein interaction; MCODE: Molecular Complex Detection; GEPIA: Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis; GTEx: Genotype-Tissue Expression; TCGA: The Cancer Genome Atlas Program; MCC: Maximal Clique Centrality; DMNC: Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component; MNC: Maximum neighborhood component; EPC: Edge Percolated component; DFS: disease-free survival; OS: overall survival; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinases",

Of these, 42 patients treated with metformin and Diamicron were included in the control group (CG) and the remaining 50 patients treated with liraglutide combined with metformin and Diamicron were enrolled in the research group (RG). The total rate of efficacy in RG was significantly higher than that in CG (P < 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions (P > 0.05). Moreover, no marked differences were observed in glucose–lipid metabolism indexes and islet β-cell function between the two groups before treatment (P > 0.05). After treatment, fasting plasma glucose, 2-h postprandial blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels remarkably decreased in both groups, and these levels were significantly lower in RG than in CG (P < 0.001). Liraglutide combined with metformin and Diamicron can effectively improve glucose – lipid metabolism in elderly patients with T2DM and enhance islet β-cell function with improved clinical efficacy.",

The study was designed to evaluate the anticancer effects of heptaphylline against the human pancreatic cancer cell and to explore the underlying mechanism. The results showed that heptaphylline inhibited the proliferation of all the pancreatic cancer cell lines with lowest IC50 of 12 µM against the PANC1 cells. In contrary, the IC50 of heptaphylline was around eight times higher against the normal H6c7 cells. The transwell assays revealed heptaphylline inhibited the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition of the PANC1 cells was also inhibited upon treatment with heptaphylline. The antiproliferative effects of heptaphylline were exerted via induction of apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. The apoptosis was associated with an increase in Bax, decrease in Bcl-2 expression, discharge of cytochrome c and cleavage of PARP, caspase-3 and caspase-9. AO staining revealed that heptaphylline induced autophagy in PANC1 cancer cells by increasing the expression of LC3B-II and Beclin-1. Taken together, heptaphylline suppresses the growth of pancreatic cancer via induction of apoptosis and autophagy and may prove a potent lead molecule for the development of chemotherapy.",

TFGE exposure in dose-dependent manner suppressed the viability of GH3 and HP75 cells at 5–30 µM concentrations. Treatment of GH3 and HP75 cells with 30 µM TFGE inhibited colony formation significantly (P < .05) compared to the un-exposed cells. In GH3 and HP75 cells, TFGE exposure suppressed invasion potential significantly (P < .05) at 5 and 30 µM concentrations. TFGE treatment at 5 and 30 µM for 72 h significantly (P < .05) elevated induction of apoptosis. The H19 expression was significantly (P < .05) inhibited by TFGE-treatment in GH3 and HEK293 cells. TFGE treatment at 2.5 and 10 mg/kg doses led to a significantly (P < .05) suppression in the tumor growth in HP75 cell-implanted mice. TFGE treatment of GH3 and HP75 cells at 5 and 30 µM down-regulated 4E-BP1 activation. TFGE treatment inhibits GH3 and HEK293 cell viability and inhibits tumor development. It suppresses H19 expression and upregulates 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in GH3 and HEK293 cells. Therefore, TFGE may be used for the treatment of pituitary adenoma.",

We applied a series of bioinformatic online databases to select and analyze the hub genes concerning cirrhosis and HCC, and identified UBE2T and CYP3A4 as hub genes for cirrhosis-HCC transformation. An elevated UBE2T and a decreased CYP3A4 were expressed in HCC compared with cirrhosis, which have been confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), Western Blotting (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The specificity (89.9%) and sensitivity (74.1%) on the combination of UBE2T and CYP3A4 for predicting HCC development in cirrhosis patients were better than that of UBE2T or CYP3A4 alone, or alpha-fetoprotein. The effectiveness of the combination of UBE2T and CYP3A4 was further verified by 15 paired HCC and paracancerous cirrhosis samples using RT–PCR, with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 80%. HCC patients with elevated UBE2T and decreased CYP3A4 expression demonstrated a poorer overall survival rate (P = 0.0016, 0.019) and disease-free survival rate (P = 0.0013, 0.041).

The aim of this study is to share the detailed procedures and clinical strategies of this rare case and review the whole 15 HCC-derived PM cases since 1857. We present an extremely rare case of an HCC metastasis to the pituitary gland with his condition and clinical course. We then discuss the dominant diagnosis and clinical therapy of HCC-derived PM and review the literature. This case demonstrated the difficulties encountered in the diagnosis of PM and the need for accurate judgment when confronting pituitary tumors with atypical features. In addition, the appropriate therapy needs to be well considered, because of the poor prognosis and severe symptoms.Abbreviations: CTA: computed tomography angiography; ETTS: endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgery; HCC: hepatocellular carcinoma; ICA: internal carotid artery; PET-CT: positron emission tomography-computed tomography; PM: pituitary metastasis",

Increasing evidence indicates that genetic factors may be crucial in the development of ILD. At present, the main pathogenic genes of ILD include genes vital for surfactant metabolism and function and telomere biology associated genes. Mutations in both sets of genes may induce the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells and finally result in remodeling of the lung interstitium. In this study, one Han Chinese family with interstitial pneumonia and lung cancer was recruited. The proband was selected for whole exome sequencing analysis.

The mutation co-segregated with the affected patients in the pedigree and was absent in the healthy controls. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that this variant is pathogenic and located in an evolutionarily conserved site of the SP-A2 protein.

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of different doses of levosimendan combined with Shenmai injection on immune function and galectin-3 and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) levels in rats with acute heart failure. Forty eight specific-pathogen free Sprague Dawley male rats were selected and divided into 6 groups according to different administration schemes after the heart failure model was established. The left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of rats in each group were observed before and after treatment. After treatment, rats in groups A–D and the model group (MG) showed decreased LVEDDs compared with the control group (CG), and group D showed the highest reduction. In contrast, rats in groups A–D and the MG showed increased LVEFs compared with the CG, and group D showed the highest increase. The MG and groups A–D rats showed an increased percent of CD3+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio compared with the CG. Levosimendan combined with Shenmai injection optimized the maintenance of immune and cardiac function in rats with acute heart failure compared with Shenmai injection alone. The higher dose of levosimendan combined with Shenmai injection improved the inflammatory reaction and levels of galectin-3 and HSP70.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of the current study was to examine the anticancer effects of naturally occurring Hirsutenone in human thyroid cancer cells along with investigating its effects on cell migration and invasion, apoptosis and Wnt/Beta-catenin signalling pathway. MTT assay and clonogenic assay were used to study effects on cell viability and cancer colony formation. Fluorescence microscopy along with flow cytometry was used to study apoptotic effects induced by Hirsutenone. Effects on Wnt/Beta-catenin signalling pathway were examined by western blot assay. Results indicated that Hirsutenone led to potent cell proliferation inhibition along with reducing cancer colony formation in a dose-dependent manner. Hirsutenone induced apoptotic effects as indicated by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining assay as well as annexin-V FITC assay. The percentage of both early and late apoptotic cells increased significantly with increasing doses of Hirsutenone. Hirsutenone also caused activation of CASPASE-3, CASPASE-9, and BAX while as it led to downregulation of BCL-2. Hirsutenone also caused the inhibition of cell migration and cell invasion along with causing suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway. In conclusion, Hirsutenone exhibits strong anticancer properties in human thyroid cancer cells mediated via apoptosis, cell migration and invasion inhibition and suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 is a member of the Rad51 family that is required for the pairing of homologous chromosomes, formation of crossovers and recombination during meiosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of Dmc1 in cattle spermatogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we measured the methylation status of bDmc1 promoter by bisulfite sequencing, and the results showed that the methylation level of -2012CpG site in bDmc1 promoter was higher in the testes of cattle-yak hybrids (30%, 3/10) with male sterility compared with cattle (0%, 0/10). Moreover, the cattle bDmc1 promoter especially -2012CpG site was highly methylated in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) in which bDmc1 was low-expressed. Luciferase assays revealed that the promoter activity of bDmc1 was decreased significantly after M.SssI methylase treatment. Real-time PCR showed that bDmc1 transcription was dramatically induced in BMECs after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. Interestingly, the differentially methylated site -2012CpG was located in the binding site for HSF by bioinformatics predictions. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of bDmc1 was regulated by its promoter methylation and provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of Dmc1 in bovine spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance emergence has contributed to global public health threat rendering the choices of antibiotics limited. Antibiotics are universally packaged by manufacturers without taking into consideration scientific basis of therapy duration. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accordance of marketed antibiotics pack size in Lebanon with national and international guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) treatment. Moreover, it is to assess the possibility of self-medication with the leftover units among Lebanese population. The marketed antibiotics were cross-referenced with the Lebanese Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (LSIDCM) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines to calculate the excess units and assessing the use of leftover units. The final list contained 34 antibiotics with 84 different pack sizes. Concerning CAP treatment, 11 packs matched LSIDCM and IDSA guidelines out of 26 and 30 combinations. Regarding LSIDCM and IDSA guidelines for UTI treatment, 45 and 18 packs result in extra units out of 63 and 26 combinations. Behaviors towards antibiotic use were significantly associated with occupation and economical status. Leftover users were more compliant with short-duration therapy with a significant ability to stop medication when symptoms improvement.",

    "abstract": "The preclinical studies on circRNA are the most popular topic these days, including many latest reports about diabetic retinophathy (DR) for both treatment and diagnosis. This review aims to investigate the treatment effects of circRNAs on DR, its potential mechanism and cell targeting in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and finally discover the optimal targeting sequence of circRNAs for further clinical application. A literature search for all potential reference articles published online until 2021 was conducted in electronic databases of Pubmed, ScienceDirect and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. This systematic review has given rise to many impressive findings of circRNAs on the treatment of DR by regulating the proliferation, migration, tube formation, apoptosis, and inflammatory response of various cells in the retina. The functional exploration of circRNAs in DR will provide new ideas or target molecules for the prevention and control of DR development. According to their effects on rodent DR model, circZNF532 and circPWWP2A were the most hopeful targets with major effects on pericytes, followed with circZNF609 and circHIPK3. Many more circRNAs would be prospectively promised to optimize the clinical outcomes of circRNAs in DR.ABBREVIATIONS: DM: diabetes mellitus; DR: diabetic retinopathy; HRVECs: human retinal vascular endothelial cells; IL-6: interleukin 6; IL-1β: interleukin 1β; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor α; VECs: human retinal vascular endothelial cells",

    "abstract": "The liver, an organ with robust regenerative capacity, is involved in many physiological functions, such as detoxification and modulation of optimal brain function. Exosomes are secreted by almost all cell types and mediate intercellular communication, as well as, they are involved in neuroinflammatory process. In this study, we found that fetal liver cell-derived exosomes (FLC-EXOs) administration to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglia, which are brain resident immune cells responsible for neuroinflammation, decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), in the LPS-activated microglia. We also examined the different signaling pathways that may be involved in this process to determine the anti-inflammatory mechanism of FLC-EXOs. The results showed that activation of the p38 pathway was attenuated after FLC-EXOs administration, which may be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of FLC-EXOs.",
