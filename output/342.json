    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of frailty and the role of inflammation is poorly understood. We examined the evidence considering the relationship between inflammation and frailty through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic literature search of papers providing data on inflammatory biomarkers and frailty was carried out in major electronic databases from inception until May 2016. From 1856 initial hits, 35 studies (32 cross-sectional studies n = 3232 frail, n = 11,483 pre-frail and n = 8522 robust, and 563 pre-frail + robust; 3 longitudinal studies n = 3402 participants without frailty at baseline) were meta-analyzed. Cross-sectional studies reported that compared to 6757 robust participants, both 1698 frail (SMD = 1.00, 95%CI: 0.40–1.61) and 8568 pre-frail (SMD = 0.33, 95%CI: 0.04–0.62) participants had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Frailty (n = 1057; SMD = 1.12, 95%CI: 0.27–2.13) and pre-frailty (n = 4467; SMD = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.00–1.11) were associated with higher serum levels of interleukin-6 compared to people who were robust (n = 2392). Frailty and pre-frailty were also significantly associated with elevated white blood cell and fibrinogen levels. In three longitudinal studies, higher serum CRP (OR = 1.06, 95%CI: 0.78–1.44,) and IL-6 (OR = 1.19, 95%CI: 0.87–1.62) were not associated with frailty. In conclusion, frailty and pre-frailty are associated with higher inflammatory parameters and in particular CRP and IL-6. Further longitudinal studies are needed.",

Ageing remains the biggest risk factor for developing idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Although research into the mechanisms leading to cell death in Parkinson's disease has shed light on many aspects of the pathogenesis of this disorder, we still cannot answer the fundamental question, what specific age related factors predispose some individuals to develop this common neurodegenerative disease. In this review we focus specifically on the neuronal population associated with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, and try to understand how ageing puts these neurons at risk to the extent that a slight change in protein metabolism or mitochondrial function can push the cells over the edge leading to catastrophic cell death and many of the symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease. We review the evidence that ageing is important for the development of Parkinson's disease and how age related decline leads to the loss of neurons within this disease, before describing exactly how advancing age may lead to substantia nigra neuronal loss and Parkinson's disease in some individuals.",

    "abstract": "Efficient control of energy metabolic homeostasis, enhanced stress resistance, and qualified cellular housekeeping are the hallmarks of improved healthspan and extended lifespan. AMPK signaling is involved in the regulation of all these characteristics via an integrated signaling network. Many studies with lower organisms have revealed that increased AMPK activity can extend the lifespan. Experiments in mammals have demonstrated that AMPK controls autophagy through mTOR and ULK1 signaling which augment the quality of cellular housekeeping. Moreover, AMPK-induced stimulation of FoxO/DAF-16, Nrf2/SKN-1, and SIRT1 signaling pathways improves cellular stress resistance. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-κB signaling by AMPK suppresses inflammatory responses. Emerging studies indicate that the responsiveness of AMPK signaling clearly declines with aging. The loss of sensitivity of AMPK activation to cellular stress impairs metabolic regulation, increases oxidative stress and reduces autophagic clearance. These age-related changes activate innate immunity defence, triggering a low-grade inflammation and metabolic disorders. We will review in detail the signaling pathways of this integrated network through which AMPK controls energy metabolism, autophagic degradation and stress resistance and ultimately the aging process.",

    "abstract": "Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, sarcopenia, is associated with physical frailty and increased risk of morbidity (chronic diseases), in addition to all-cause mortality. The loss of muscle mass occurs incipiently from middle-age (∼1%/year), and in severe instances can lead to a loss of ∼50% by the 8–9th decade of life. This review will focus on muscle deterioration with ageing and highlight the two underpinning mechanisms regulating declines in muscle mass and function: muscle fibre atrophy and muscle fibre loss (hypoplasia) – and their measurement. The mechanisms of muscle fibre atrophy in humans relate to imbalances in muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and breakdown (MPB); however, since there is limited evidence for basal alterations in muscle protein turnover, it would appear that \"anabolic resistance\" to fundamental environmental cues regulating diurnal muscle homeostasis (namely physical activity and nutrition), underlie age-related catabolic perturbations in muscle proteostasis. While the 'upstream' drivers of the desensitization of aged muscle to anabolic stimuli are poorly defined, they most likely relate to impaired efficiency of the conversion of nutritional/exercise stimuli into signalling impacting mRNA translation and proteolysis. Additionally, loss of muscle fibres has been shown in cadaveric studies using anatomical fibre counts, and from iEMG studies demonstrating motor unit loss, albeit with few molecular investigations of this in humans. We suggest that defining countermeasures against sarcopenia requires improved understandings of the co-ordinated regulation of muscle fibre atrophy and fibre loss, which are likely to be inextricably linked.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by low-grade inflammation and high levels of clinical heterogeneity. Aberrant chondrocyte metabolism is a response to changes in the inflammatory microenvironment and may play a key role in cartilage degeneration and OA progression. Under conditions of environmental stress, chondrocytes tend to adapt their metabolism to microenvironmental changes by shifting from one metabolic pathway to another, for example from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Similar changes occur in other joint cells, including synoviocytes. Switching between these pathways is implicated in metabolic alterations that involve mitochondrial dysfunction, enhanced anaerobic glycolysis, and altered lipid and amino acid metabolism. The shift between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis is mainly regulated by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Chondrocyte metabolic changes are likely to be a feature of different OA phenotypes. Determining the role of chondrocyte metabolism in OA has revealed key features of disease pathogenesis. Future research should place greater emphasis on immunometabolism and altered metabolic pathways as a means to understand the pathophysiology of age-related OA. This knowledge will advance the development of new drugs against therapeutic targets of metabolic significance.",

    "abstract": "Frailty is a common negative consequence of ageing. Sarcopenia, the syndrome of loss of muscle mass, quality and strength, is more common in older adults and has been considered a precursor syndrome or the physical manifestation of frailty. The pathophysiology of both syndromes is incompletely described with multiple causes, inter-relationships and complex pathways proposed. Age-associated changes to the immune system (both immunesenescence, the decline in immune function with ageing, and inflammageing, a state of chronic inflammation) have been suggested as contributors to sarcopenia and frailty but a direct causative role remains to be established. Frailty, sarcopenia and immunesenescence are commonly described in older adults but are not ubiquitous to ageing. There is evidence that all three conditions are reversible and all three appear to share common inflammatory drivers. It is unclear whether frailty, sarcopenia and immunesenescence are separate entities that co-occur due to coincidental or potentially confounding factors, or whether they are more intimately linked by the same underlying cellular mechanisms. This review explores these possibilities focusing on innate immunity, and in particular associations with neutrophil dysfunction, inflammation and known mechanisms described to date. Furthermore, we consider whether the age-related decline in immune cell function (such as neutrophil migration), increased inflammation and the dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway in neutrophils could contribute pathogenically to sarcopenia and frailty.",

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the relationship between systemic inflammation, muscle strength and/or muscle mass in adults. An electronic search using keywords such as 'acute phase proteins, cytokines and sarcopenia, muscle mass, muscle strength' was conducted via Pubmed, Web of Science and Embase from inception until the 30th of June 2020. A meta-analysis using correlation data was performed to determine the overall relationship between inflammation and muscle strength and muscle mass in adults. Overall, 168 articles; 149 cross-sectional articles (n = 76,899 participants, 47.0 % male) and 19 longitudinal articles (n = 12,295 participants, 31.9 % male) met inclusion criteria. Independent of disease state, higher levels of C reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin (IL)-6 and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α were associated with lower handgrip and knee extension strength (CRP; r = −0.10, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = −0.13, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = −0.08, p < 0.001 and CRP; r = −0.18, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = −0.11, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = −0.13, p < 0.001 respectively) and muscle mass (CRP; r = −0.12, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = −0.09, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = −0.15, p < 0.001). Furthermore, higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers appeared to be associated with lower muscle strength and muscle mass over time. Higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers are significantly associated with lower skeletal muscle strength and muscle mass.",

    "abstract": "Aging involves a diverse set of biological changes accumulating over time that leads to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Epigenetic clocks are now widely used to quantify biological aging, in order to investigate determinants that modify the rate of aging and to predict age-related outcomes. Numerous biological, social and environmental factors have been investigated for their relationship to epigenetic clock acceleration and deceleration. The aim of this review was to synthesize general trends concerning the associations between human epigenetic clocks and these investigated factors. We conducted a systematic review of all available literature and included 156 publications across 4 resource databases. We compiled a list of all presently existing blood-based epigenetic clocks. Subsequently, we created an extensive dataset of over 1300 study findings in which epigenetic clocks were utilized in blood tissue of human subjects to assess the relationship between these clocks and numeral environmental exposures and human traits. Statistical analysis was possible on 57 such relationships, measured across 4 different epigenetic clocks (Hannum, Horvath, Levine and GrimAge). We found that the Horvath, Hannum, Levine and GrimAge epigenetic clocks tend to agree in direction of effects, but vary in size. Body mass index, HIV infection, and male sex were significantly associated with acceleration of one or more epigenetic clocks. Acceleration of epigenetic clocks was also significantly related to mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Our findings provide a graphical and numerical synopsis of the past decade of epigenetic age estimation research and indicate areas where further attention could be focused in the coming years.",

    "abstract": "Ageing of the global population has become a public health concern with an important socio-economic dimension. Ageing is characterized by an increase in the concentration of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, a phenomenon that has been termed \"inflammageing\". The inflammatory response is beneficial as an acute, transient reaction to harmful conditions, facilitating the defense, repair, turnover and adaptation of many tissues. However, chronic and low grade inflammation is likely to be detrimental for many tissues and for normal functions. We provide an overview of low grade inflammation (LGI) and determine the potential drivers and the effects of the \"inflamed\" phenotype observed in the elderly. We discuss the role of gut microbiota and immune system crosstalk and the gut-brain axis. Then, we focus on major health complications associated with LGI in the elderly, including mental health and wellbeing, metabolic abnormalities and infections. Finally, we discuss the possibility of manipulating LGI in the elderly by nutritional interventions. We provide an overview of the evidence that exists in the elderly for omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic, prebiotic, antioxidant and polyphenol interventions as a means to influence LGI. We conclude that slowing, controlling or reversing LGI is likely to be an important way to prevent, or reduce the severity of, age-related functional decline and the onset of conditions affecting health and well-being; that there is evidence to support specific dietary interventions as a strategy to control LGI; and that a continued research focus on this field is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Older people constitute a significant proportion of the total population and their number is projected to increase by more than half by 2030. This increasing probability of late survival comes with considerable individual, economic and social impact. Physical activity (PA) can influence the ageing process but the specific relationship with healthy ageing (HA) is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies examining the associations of PA with HA. Studies were identified from a systematic search across major electronic databases from inception as January 2017. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate a pooled effect size (ES) and 95% CIs. Studies were assessed for methodological quality. Overall, 23 studies were identified including 174,114 participants (30% men) with age ranges from 20 to 87 years old. There was considerable heterogeneity in the definition and measurement of HA and PA. Most of the identified studies reported a significant positive association of PA with HA, six reported a non-significant. Meta-analysis revealed that PA is positively associated with HA (ES: 1.39, 95% CI = 1.23–1.57, n = 17) even if adjusted for publication bias (ES: 1.27, 95% CI = 1.11–1.45, n = 20). There is consistent evidence from longitudinal observational studies that PA is positively associated with HA, regardless of definition and measurement. Future research should focus on the implementation of a single metric of HA, on the use of objective measures for PA assessment and on a full-range of confounding adjustment. In addition, our research indicated the limited research on ageing in low-and-middle income countries.",

    "abstract": "Use of the frailty index to measure an accumulation of deficits has been proven a valuable method for identifying elderly people at risk for increased vulnerability, disease, injury, and mortality. However, complementary molecular frailty biomarkers or ideally biomarker panels have not yet been identified. We conducted a systematic search to identify biomarker candidates for a frailty biomarker panel.Gene expression databases were searched (http://genomics.senescence.info/genes including GenAge, AnAge, LongevityMap, CellAge, DrugAge, Digital Aging Atlas) to identify genes regulated in aging, longevity, and age-related diseases with a focus on secreted factors or molecules detectable in body fluids as potential frailty biomarkers. Factors broadly expressed, related to several \"hallmark of aging\" pathways as well as used or predicted as biomarkers in other disease settings, particularly age-related pathologies, were identified. This set of biomarkers was further expanded according to the expertise and experience of the authors. In the next step, biomarkers were assigned to six \"hallmark of aging\" pathways, namely (1) inflammation, (2) mitochondria and apoptosis, (3) calcium homeostasis, (4) fibrosis, (5) NMJ (neuromuscular junction) and neurons, (6) cytoskeleton and hormones, or (7) other principles and an extensive literature search was performed for each candidate to explore their potential and priority as frailty biomarkers.A total of 44 markers were evaluated in the seven categories listed above, and 19 were awarded a high priority score, 22 identified as medium priority and three were low priority. In each category high and medium priority markers were identified.Biomarker panels for frailty would be of high value and better than single markers. Based on our search we would propose a core panel of frailty biomarkers consisting of (1) CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), IL-6 (interleukin 6), CX3CL1 (C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1), (2) GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15), FNDC5 (fibronectin type III domain containing 5), vimentin (VIM), (3) regucalcin (RGN/SMP30), calreticulin, (4) PLAU (plasminogen activator, urokinase), AGT (angiotensinogen), (5) BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor), progranulin (PGRN), (6) α-klotho (KL), FGF23 (fibroblast growth factor 23), FGF21, leptin (LEP), (7) miRNA (micro Ribonucleic acid) panel (to be further defined), AHCY (adenosylhomocysteinase) and KRT18 (keratin 18). An expanded panel would also include (1) pentraxin (PTX3), sVCAM/ICAM (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1/Intercellular adhesion molecule 1), defensin α, (2) APP (amyloid beta precursor protein), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), (3) S100B (S100 calcium binding protein B), (4) TGFβ (transforming growth factor beta), PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1), TGM2 (transglutaminase 2), (5) sRAGE (soluble receptor for advanced glycosylation end products), HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1), C3/C1Q (complement factor 3/1Q), ST2 (Interleukin 1 receptor like 1), agrin (AGRN), (6) IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), resistin (RETN), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), ghrelin (GHRL), growth hormone (GH), (7) microparticle panel (to be further defined), GpnmB (glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B) and lactoferrin (LTF). We believe that these predicted panels need to be experimentally explored in animal models and frail cohorts in order to ascertain their diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia represents a muscle-wasting syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength occurring during normal aging. Sarcopenia patients are mainly suffering from the loss in muscle strength and are faced with mobility disorders reducing their quality of life and are, therefore, at higher risk for morbidity (falls, bone fracture, metabolic diseases) and mortality. Several molecular mechanisms have been described as causes for sarcopenia that refer to very different levels of muscle physiology. These mechanisms cover e. g. function of hormones (e. g. IGF-1 and Insulin), muscle fiber composition and neuromuscular drive, myo-satellite cell potential to differentiate and proliferate, inflammatory pathways as well as intracellular mechanisms in the processes of proteostasis and mitochondrial function. In this review, we describe sarcopenia as a muscle-wasting syndrome distinct from other atrophic diseases and summarize the current view on molecular causes of sarcopenia development as well as open questions provoking further research efforts for establishing efficient lifestyle and therapeutic interventions.",

The first biochemical and clinical studies were followed by a major expansion in the last 20 years with the development of animal disease models and new approaches leading to a major advancement of understanding of the role of physiological and degenerative processes in the brain at the molecular level. This includes the understanding of the major role of autophagy and the cathepsins in a number of diseases, including its critical role in the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Similarly, cathepsins and some other lysosomal proteases were shown to have important roles in processing and/or degradation of several important neuronal proteins, thereby having either neuroprotective or harmful roles. In this review, we discuss lysosomal cathepsins and their regulation with the focus on cysteine cathepsins and their endogenous inhibitors, as well as their role in several neurodegenerative diseases.",

Reports of association between telomere length (TL) and all-cause mortality remain inconsistent. In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed using published cohort studies and un-published data from the Swedish Twin Registry (STR). Twenty-five studies were included: four STR cohorts (12,083 individuals with 2517 deaths) and 21 published studies. In the STR studies, one standard deviation (SD) decrement of leukocyte TL corresponded to 13% increased all-cause mortality risk (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7%-19%); individuals in the shortest TL quarter had 44% higher hazard (95% CI: 27%-63%) than those in the longest quarter. Meta-analysis of all eligible studies (121,749 individuals with 21,763 deaths) revealed one SD TL decrement-associated hazard ratio of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06-1.13); those in the shortest TL quarter had 26% higher hazard (95% CI: 15%-38%) compared to the longest quarter, although between-study heterogeneity was observed. Analyses stratified by age indicated that the hazard ratio was smaller in individuals over 80 years old. In summary, short telomeres are associated with increased all-cause mortality risk in the general population. However, TL measurement techniques and age at measurement contribute to the heterogeneity of effect estimation.",

    "abstract": "Short telomeres confer risk of degenerative diseases. Chronic psychological stress can lead to disease through many pathways, and research from in vitro studies to human longitudinal studies has pointed to stress-induced telomere damage as an important pathway. However, there has not been a comprehensive model to describe how changes in stress physiology and neuroendocrine pathways can lead to changes in telomere biology. Critically short telomeres or the collapse of the telomere structure caused by displacement of telomere binding protein complex shelterin elicit a DNA damage response and lead to senescence or apoptosis. In this narrative review, we summarize the key roles glucocorticoids, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria, and inflammation play in mediating the relationship between psychological stress and telomere maintenance. We emphasis that these mediators are interconnected and reinforce each other in positive feedback loops. Telomere length has not been studied across the lifespan yet, but the initial setting point at birth appears to be the most influential point, as it sets the lifetime trajectory, and is influenced by stress. We describe two types of intergenerational stress effects on telomeres - prenatal stress effects on telomeres during fetal development, and 'telotype transmission\" -the directly inherited transmission of short telomeres from parental germline. It is clear that the initial simplistic view of telomere length as a mitotic clock has evolved into a far more complex picture of both transgenerational telomere influences, and of interconnected molecular and cellular pathways and networks, as hallmarks of aging where telomere maintenance is a key player interacting with mitochondria. Further mechanistic investigations testing this comprehensive model of stress mediators shaping telomere biology and the telomere-mitochondrial nexus will lead to better understanding from cell to human lifespan aging, and could lead to anti-aging interventions.",

    "abstract": "Forming the first line of defence against virally infected and malignant cells, natural killer (NK) cells are critical effector cells of the innate immune system. With age, significant impairments have been reported in the two main mechanisms by which NK cells confer host protection: direct cytotoxicity and the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines. In elderly subjects, decreased NK cell activity has been shown to be associated with an increased incidence and severity of viral infection, highlighting the clinical implications that age-associated changes in NK cell biology have on the health of older adults. However, is an increased susceptibility to viral infection the only consequence of these age-related changes in NK cell function? Recently, evidence has emerged that has shown that in addition to eliminating transformed cells, NK cells are involved in many other biological processes such as immune regulation, anti-microbial immune responses and the recognition and elimination of senescent cells, novel functions that involve NK-mediated cytotoxicity and/or cytokine production. Thus, the decrease in NK cell function that accompanies physiological ageing is likely to have wider implications for the health of older adults than originally thought. Here, we give a detailed description of the changes in NK cell biology that accompany human ageing and propose that certain features of the ageing process such as: (i) the increased reactivation rates of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, (ii) the slower resolution of inflammatory responses and (iii) the increased incidence of bacterial and fungal infection are attributable in part to an age-associated decline in NK cell function.",

AD is characterized by accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates including amyloid plaques (composed of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides) and neurofibrillary tangles (formed by hyper-phosphorylated tau protein). Synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, calcium signaling etc. also show dysfunction in AD patients. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosome-dependent cellular event in eukaryotes. It is closely linked to modulation of protein metabolism, through which damaged organelles and mis-folded proteins are degraded and then recycled to maintain protein homeostasis. Accumulating evidence has shown that impaired autophagy also contributes to AD pathogenesis. In the present review, we highlight the role of autophagy, including bulk and selective autophagy, in regulating metabolic circuits in AD pathogenesis. We also discuss the potential and future perspectives of autophagy-inducing strategies in AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "An excess of saturated fatty acids and simple sugars in the diet is a known environmental risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the holistic view of the interacting processes through which such diet may contribute to AD pathogenesis is missing. We addressed this need through extensive analysis of published studies investigating the effects of western diet (WD) on AD development in humans and laboratory animals. We reviewed WD-induced systemic alterations comprising metabolic changes, induction of obesity and adipose tissue inflammation, gut microbiota dysbiosis and acceleration of systemic low-grade inflammation. Next we provide an overview of the evidence demonstrating that WD-associated systemic alterations drive impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and development of neuroinflammation paralleled by accumulation of toxic amyloid. Later these changes are followed by dysfunction of synaptic transmission, neurodegeneration and finally memory and cognitive impairment. We conclude that WD can trigger AD by acceleration of inflammaging, and that BBB impairment induced by metabolic and systemic inflammation play the central role in this process. Moreover, the concurrence of neuroinflammation and Aβ dyshomeostasis, which by reciprocal interactions drive the vicious cycle of neurodegeneration, contradicts Aβ as the primary trigger of AD. Given that in 2019 the World Health Organization recommended focusing on modifiable risk factors in AD prevention, this overview of the sequential, complex pathomechanisms initiated by WD, which can lead from peripheral disturbances to neurodegeneration, can support future prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "The absolute reliance of the mammalian brain on oxygen to generate ATP renders it acutely vulnerable to hypoxia, whether at high altitude or in clinical settings of anemia or pulmonary disease. Hypoxia is pivotal to the pathogeneses of myriad neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Conversely, reduced environmental oxygen, e.g. sojourns or residing at high altitudes, may impart favorable effects on aging and mortality. Moreover, controlled hypoxia exposure may represent a treatment strategy for age-related neurological disorders. This review discusses evidence of hypoxia's beneficial vs. detrimental impacts on the aging brain and the molecular mechanisms that mediate these divergent effects. It draws upon an extensive literature search on the effects of hypoxia/altitude on brain aging, and detailed analysis of all identified studies directly comparing brain responses to hypoxia in young vs. aged humans or rodents. Special attention is directed toward the risks vs. benefits of hypoxia exposure to the elderly, and potential therapeutic applications of hypoxia for neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, important questions for future research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in ageing, affecting around 46 million people worldwide but few treatments are currently available. The etiology of AD is still puzzling, and new drugs development and clinical trials have high failure rates. Urgent outline of an integral (multi-target) and effective treatment of AD is needed. Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is considered one of the fundamental neuropathological pillars of the disease, and its dyshomeostasis has shown a crucial role in AD onset. Therefore, many amyloid-targeted therapies have been investigated. Here, we will systematically review recent (from 2014) investigational, follow-up and review studies focused on anti-amyloid strategies to summarize and analyze their current clinical potential. Combination of anti-Aβ therapies with new developing early detection biomarkers and other therapeutic agents acting on early functional AD changes will be highlighted in this review. Near-term approval seems likely for several drugs acting against Aβ, with recent FDA approval of a monoclonal anti-Aβ oligomers antibody –aducanumab– raising hopes and controversies. We conclude that, development of oligomer-epitope specific Aβ treatment and implementation of multiple improved biomarkers and risk prediction methods allowing early detection, together with therapies acting on other factors such as hyperexcitability in early AD, could be the key to slowing this global pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are the main catabolic organelles of a cell and play a pivotal role in a plethora of cellular processes, including responses to nutrient availability and composition, stress resistance, programmed cell death, plasma membrane repair, development, and cell differentiation. In line with this pleiotropic importance for cellular and organismal life and death, lysosomal dysfunction is associated with many age-related pathologies like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as with a decline in lifespan. Conversely, targeting lysosomal functional capacity is emerging as a means to promote longevity. Here, we analyze the current knowledge on the prominent influence of lysosomes on aging-related processes, such as their executory and regulatory roles during general and selective macroautophagy, or their storage capacity for amino acids and ions. In addition, we review and discuss the roles of lysosomes as active players in the mechanisms underlying known lifespan-extending interventions like, for example, spermidine or rapamycin administration. In conclusion, this review aims at critically examining the nature and pliability of the different layers, in which lysosomes are involved as a control hub for aging and longevity.",

    "abstract": "Due to their bioactivity and harmful potential, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are discussed to affect human health. AGEs are compounds formed endogenously in the human body andexogenously, especially, in foods while thermal processing. In contrast to endogenous AGEs, dietary AGEs are formed in much higher extent. However, their risk potential is also depending on absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. For over 10 years an intense debate on the risk of dietary AGEs on human health is going on. On the one hand, studies provided evidence that dietary AGEs contribute to clinical outcomes. On the other hand, human studies failed to observe any association. Because it was not possible to draw a final conclusion, the call for new interdisciplinary approaches arose. In this review, we will give an overview on the current state of scientific knowledge in this field. In particular, we focus on (I) the occurrence of AGEs in foods and the daily uptake of AGEs, (II) contribution to endogenous levels and (III) the effect on health-/disease-related biomarkers in humans.",

    "abstract": "Engaging in physical activity (PA) and avoiding sedentary behavior (SB) are important for healthy ageing with benefits including the mitigation of disability and mortality. Whether benefits extend to key determinants of disability and mortality, namely muscle strength and muscle power, is unclear.This systematic review aimed to describe the association of objective measures of PA and SB with measures of skeletal muscle strength and muscle power in community-dwelling older adults.Six databases were searched from their inception to June 21st, 2020 for articles reporting associations between objectively measured PA and SB and upper body or lower body muscle strength or muscle power in community dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. An overview of associations was visualized by effect direction heat maps, standardized effect sizes were estimated with albatross plots and summarized in box plots. Articles reporting adjusted standardized regression coefficients (β) were included in meta-analyses.A total of 112 articles were included representing 43,796 individuals (range: 21 to 3726 per article) with a mean or median age from 61.0 to 88.0 years (mean 56.4 % female). Higher PA measures and lower SB were associated with better upper body muscle strength (hand grip strength), upper body muscle power (arm curl), lower body muscle strength, and lower body muscle power (chair stand test). Median standardized effect sizes were consistently larger for measures of PA and SB with lower compared to upper body muscle strength and muscle power. The meta-analyses of adjusted β coefficients confirmed the associations between total PA (TPA), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and light PA (LPA) with hand grip strength (β = 0.041, β = 0.057, and β = 0.070, respectively, all p ≤ 0.001), and TPA and MVPA with chair stand test (β = 0.199 and β = 0.211, respectively, all p ≤ 0.001).Higher PA and lower SB are associated with greater skeletal muscle strength and muscle power, particularly with the chair stand test.",

    "abstract": "As people age they become increasingly susceptible to chronic and extremely debilitating brain diseases. The precise cause of the neuronal degeneration underlying these disorders, and indeed normal brain ageing remains however elusive. Considering the limits of existing preventive methods, there is a desire to develop effective and safe strategies. Growing preclinical and clinical research in healthy individuals or at the early stage of cognitive decline has demonstrated the beneficial impact of nutrition on cognitive functions. The present review is the most recent in a series produced by the Nutrition and Mental Performance Task Force under the auspice of the International Life Sciences Institute Europe (ILSI Europe). The latest scientific advances specific to how dietary nutrients and non-nutrient may affect cognitive ageing are presented. Furthermore, several key points related to mechanisms contributing to brain ageing, pathological conditions affecting brain function, and brain biomarkers are also discussed. Overall, findings are inconsistent and fragmented and more research is warranted to determine the underlying mechanisms and to establish dose-response relationships for optimal brain maintenance in different population subgroups. Such approaches are likely to provide the necessary evidence to develop research portfolios that will inform about new dietary recommendations on how to prevent cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "The applications of modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms within the field of aging research offer tremendous opportunities. Aging is an almost universal unifying feature possessed by all living organisms, tissues, and cells. Modern deep learning techniques used to develop age predictors offer new possibilities for formerly incompatible dynamic and static data types. AI biomarkers of aging enable a holistic view of biological processes and allow for novel methods for building causal models—extracting the most important features and identifying biological targets and mechanisms. Recent developments in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning (RL) permit the generation of diverse synthetic molecular and patient data, identification of novel biological targets, and generation of novel molecular compounds with desired properties and geroprotectors. These novel techniques can be combined into a unified, seamless end-to-end biomarker development, target identification, drug discovery and real world evidence pipeline that may help accelerate and improve pharmaceutical research and development practices. Modern AI is therefore expected to contribute to the credibility and prominence of longevity biotechnology in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, and to the convergence of countless areas of research.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and pharmacological intervention studies have identified evolutionarily conserved and functionally interconnected networks of cellular energy homeostasis, nutrient-sensing, and genome damage response signaling pathways, as prominent regulators of longevity and health span in various species. Mitochondria are the primary sites of ATP production and key players in several other important cellular processes. Mitochondrial dysfunction diminishes tissue and organ functional performance and is a commonly considered feature of the aging process. Here we review the evidence that through reciprocal and multilevel functional interactions, mitochondria are implicated in the lifespan modulation function of these pathways, which altogether constitute a highly dynamic and complex system that controls the aging process. An important characteristic of these pathways is their extensive crosstalk and apparent malleability to modification by non-invasive pharmacological, dietary, and lifestyle interventions, with promising effects on lifespan and health span in animal models and potentially also in humans.",

    "abstract": "As the population ages, the number of people with dementia is expected to increase in the coming decades, with consequences at the societal and individual levels. In this narrative review, we provide a summary of the scientific evidence concerning dementia prevention, with a focus on the following three strategies: 1) Targeting the body to protect the brain, including prevention and treatment of cardiovascular morbidity; 2) Compensatory interventions to counteract brain ageing, including education and life-long engagement in cognitively and socially stimulating activities; and 3) Lifespan health promotion, such as a physically active lifestyle, smoking cessation, and a healthy and balanced diet. Next, we consider the biological mechanisms by which these strategies may act by taking into account the main pathways implicated in the development and progression of dementia: neurodegeneration, brain resilience, vascular damage, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Based on the current evidence, and in line with the declining trends of dementia incidence in high-income countries, we conclude that timely multidomain preventive actions are promising strategies to reduce the dementia epidemic worldwide. There is still a considerable gap between the epidemiological evidence and its underlying biological mechanisms. Filling this gap will be crucial to move forward in dementia prevention worldwide.",

    "abstract": "While the elderly segment of the population continues growing in importance, neurodegenerative diseases increase exponentially. Lifestyle factors such as nutrition, exercise, and education, among others, influence ageing progression, throughout life. Notably, the Central Nervous System (CNS) can benefit from nutritional strategies and dietary interventions that prevent signs of senescence, such as cognitive decline or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's Disease. The dietary polyphenol Resveratrol (RV) possesses antioxidant and cytoprotective effects, producing neuroprotection in several organisms. The oxidative stress (OS) occurs because of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation that has been proposed to explain the cause of the ageing. One of the most harmful effects of ROS in the cell is DNA damage. Nevertheless, there is also evidence demonstrating that OS can produce other molecular changes such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, apoptosis, and epigenetic modifications, among others. Interestingly, the dietary polyphenol RV is a potent antioxidant and possesses pleiotropic actions, exerting its activity through various molecular pathways. In addition, recent evidence has shown that RV mediates epigenetic changes involved in ageing and the function of the CNS that persists across generations. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that RV interacts with gut microbiota, showing modifications in bacterial composition associated with beneficial effects. In this review, we give a comprehensive overview of the main mechanisms of action of RV in different experimental models, including clinical trials and discuss how the interconnection of these molecular events could explain the neuroprotective effects induced by RV.",

Recently, translational studies have begun to connect the dots between protein alterations and deposition, brain network dysfunction and cognitive deficits. Disturbance of neuronal activity, and in particular an imbalance in underlying excitation/inhibition (E/I), appears early in AD, and can be regarded as forming a central link between structural brain pathology and cognitive dysfunction. While there are emerging (non-)pharmacological options to influence this imbalance, the complexity of human brain dynamics has hindered identification of an optimal approach. We suggest that focusing on the integration of neurophysiological aspects of AD at the micro-, meso- and macroscale, with the support of computational network modeling, can unite fundamental and clinical knowledge, provide a general framework, and suggest rational therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The oocyte is recognised as the largest cell in mammalian species and other multicellular organisms. Mitochondria represent a high proportion of the cytoplasm in oocytes and mitochondrial architecture is different in oocytes than in somatic cells, characterised by a rounder appearance and fragmented network. Although the number of mitochondria per oocyte is higher than in any other mammalian cell, their number and activity decrease with advancing age. Mitochondria integrate numerous processes essential for cellular function, such as metabolic processes related to energy production, biosynthesis, and waste removal, as well as Ca2+ signalling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Further, mitochondria are responsible for the cellular adaptation to different types of stressors such as oxidative stress or DNA damage. When these stressors outstrip the adaptive capacity of mitochondria to restore homeostasis, it leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. Decades of studies indicate that mitochondrial function is multifaceted, which is reflected in the oocyte, where mitochondria support numerous processes during oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development. Dysregulation of mitochondrial processes has been consistently reported in ageing and age-related diseases. In this review, we describe the functions of mitochondria as bioenergetic powerhouses and signal transducers in oocytes, how dysfunction of mitochondrial processes contributes to reproductive ageing, and whether mitochondria could be targeted to promote oocyte rejuvenation.",

    "abstract": "Ageism has been shown to have a negative impact on older people's health and wellbeing. Though multiple scales are currently being used to measure this increasingly important issue, syntheses of the psychometric properties of these scales are unavailable. This means that existing estimates of ageism prevalence may not be accurate. We conducted a systematic review aimed at identifying available ageism scales and evaluating their scope and psychometric properties. A comprehensive search strategy was used across fourteen different databases, including PubMed and CINAHL. Independent reviewers extracted data and appraised risk of bias following the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidelines. Of the 29,664 records identified, 106 studies, assessing 11 explicit scales of ageism, were eligible for inclusion. Only one scale, the 'Expectations Regarding Aging' met minimum requirements for psychometric validation (i.e., adequate content validity, structural validity and internal consistency). Still, this scale only assesses the 'stereotype' dimension of ageism, thus failing to evaluate the other two ageism dimensions (prejudice and discrimination). This paper highlights the need to develop and validate a scale that accounts for the multidimensional nature of ageism. Having a scale that can accurately measure ageism prevalence is key in a time of increasing and rapid population ageing, where the magnitude of this phenomenon may be increasing.",

Design: Systematic Review and Bayesian Model-Based Network Meta-Analysis. Data sources: Systematic search of MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions in participants aged 50 years or over, and that reported on at least one global cognition outcome. Results: The search returned 1998 records, of which 44 studies (4793 participants; 102 different effect sizes) were included in this review with meta-analysis. There was a non-linear, dose-response association between overall exercise and cognition. We found no minimal threshold for the beneficial effect of exercise on cognition. The estimated minimal exercise dose associated with clinically relevant changes in cognition was 724 METs-min per week, and doses beyond 1200 METs-min per week provided less clear benefits. We also found that the dose-response association was exercise type dependent, and our results show that clinically important effects may occur at lower doses for many types of exercise. Our findings also highlighted the superior effects of resistance exercises over other modalities. Conclusions: If provided with the most potent modalities, older adults can get clinical meaningful benefits with lower doses than the WHO guidelines. Findings support the WHO recommendations to emphasise resistance training as a critical component of interventions for older adults.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) increases not only because of longer life expectancy but also because of the modern lifestyle, in particular physical inactivity and diets low in fiber and rich in sugar and saturated fats, which promote chronic low-grade inflammation and obesity. Adverse alterations of the gut microbiota (GMB) composition, called microbial dysbiosis, may favor metabolic syndrome and inflammaging, two important components of OA onset and evolution. Considering the burden of OA and the need to define preventive and therapeutic interventions targeting the modifiable components of OA, an expert working group was convened by the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) to review the potential contribution of GMB to OA. Such a contribution is supported by observational or dietary intervention studies in animal models of OA and in humans. In addition, several well-recognized risk factors of OA interact with GMB. Lastly, GMB is a critical determinant of drug metabolism and bioavailability and may influence the response to OA medications. Further research targeting GMB or its metabolites is needed to move the field of OA from symptomatic management to individualized interventions targeting its pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Human aging is a multifactorial phenomenon that affects numerous organ systems and cellular processes, with the immune system being one of the most dysregulated. Immunosenescence, the gradual deterioration of the immune system, and inflammaging, a chronic inflammatory state that persists in the elderly, are among the plethora of immune changes that occur during aging. Almost all populations of immune cells change with age in terms of numbers and/or activity. These alterations are in general highly detrimental, resulting in an increased susceptibility to infections, reduced healing abilities, and altered homeostasis that promote the emergence of age-associated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and other diseases associated with inflammation. Thanks to recent developments, several strategies have been proposed to target central immunological processes or specific immune subpopulations affected by aging. These therapeutic approaches could soon be applied in the clinic to slow down or even reverse specific age-induced immune changes in order to rejuvenate the immune system and prevent or reduce the impact of various diseases. Due to its systemic nature and interconnection with all the other systems in the body, the immune system is an attractive target for aging intervention because relatively targeted modifications to a small set of cells have the potential to improve the health of multiple organ systems. Therefore, anti-aging immune targeting therapies could represent a potent approach for improving healthspan. Here, we review aging changes in the major components of the immune system, we summarize the current immune-targeting therapeutic approaches in the context of aging and discuss the future directions in the field of immune rejuvenation.",

    "abstract": "The definition of sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass, has evolved since the term's inception and yet there is no consensus. Many of the identified definitions of sarcopenia centre their criteria around the loss of muscle mass, loss of function, and weakness. Common variables to various definitions of sarcopenia are appendicular lean soft tissue mass (often called muscle mass), grip strength, and gait speed. However, a lack of consensus remains among operational definitions and diagnostics for this newly recognized disease and may be attributed to the absence of appropriate tools that accurately measure the outcomes of interest, such as skeletal muscle instead of lean mass. In this narrative review, we describe the evolution of the consensus groups' definition of sarcopenia, address the need for more accurate measures of muscle mass and function, and effective, low-cost treatments (i.e., resistance training and diet) for this disease. Consensus on what constitutes sarcopenia is critical to propel research in the field and, importantly, provide what prognostic value a sarcopenia diagnosis provides and how such a patient would be treated.",

While astrocytes certainly contribute to classic inflammatory processes (e.g. cytokine release, waste clearance, and tissue repair), newly emerging technologies for measuring and targeting cell specific activities in the brain have uncovered essential roles for astrocytes in synapse function, brain metabolism, neurovascular coupling, and sleep/wake patterns. In this review, we use a holistic approach to incorporate, and expand upon, classic neuroinflammatory concepts to consider how astrocyte dysfunction/reactivity modulates multiple pathological and clinical hallmarks of AD. Our ever-evolving understanding of astrocyte signaling in neurodegeneration is not only revealing new drug targets and treatments for dementia but is suggesting we reimagine AD pathophysiological mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Elastic fibers are essential constituents of the extracellular matrix of higher vertebrates and endow several tissues and organs including lungs, skin and blood vessels with elasticity and resilience. During the human lifespan, elastic fibers are exposed to a variety of enzymatic, chemical and biophysical influences, and accumulate damage due to their low turnover. Aging of elastin and elastic fibers involves enzymatic degradation, oxidative damage, glycation, calcification, aspartic acid racemization, binding of lipids and lipid peroxidation products, carbamylation and mechanical fatigue. These processes can trigger an impairment or loss of elastic fiber function and are associated with severe pathologies. There are different inherited or acquired pathological conditions, which influence the structure and function of elastic fibers and microfibrils predominantly in the cardiorespiratory system and skin. Inherited elastic-fiber pathologies have a direct or indirect impact on elastic-fiber formation due to mutations in the fibrillin genes (fibrillinopathies), in the elastin gene (elastinopathies) or in genes encoding proteins that are associated with microfibrils or elastic fibers. Acquired elastic-fiber pathologies appear age-related or as a result of multiple factors impairing tissue homeostasis. This review gives an overview on the fate of elastic fibers over the human lifespan in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is activated in chronic inflammatory states, e.g., in the aging process and age-related diseases. IDO1 enzyme catabolizes L-tryptophan (L-Trp) into kynurenine (KYN) thus stimulating the KYN pathway. The depletion of L-Trp inhibits the proliferation of immune cells in inflamed tissues and it also reduces serotonin synthesis predisposing to psychiatric disorders. Interestingly, IDO1 protein contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) which trigger suppressive signaling through the binding of PI3K p110 and SHP-1 proteins. This immunosuppressive activity is not dependent on the catalytic activity of IDO1. KYN and its metabolite, kynurenic acid (KYNA), are potent activators of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) which can enhance immunosuppression. IDO1-KYN-AhR signaling counteracts excessive pro-inflammatory responses in acute inflammation but in chronic inflammatory states it has many harmful effects. A chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with the aging process, a state called inflammaging. There is substantial evidence that the activation of the IDO1-KYN-AhR pathway robustly increases with the aging process. The activation of IDO1-KYN-AhR signaling does not only suppress the functions of effector immune cells, probably promoting immunosenescence, but it also impairs autophagy, induces cellular senescence, and remodels the extracellular matrix as well as enhancing the development of osteoporosis and vascular diseases. I will review the function of IDO1-KYN-AhR signaling and discuss its activation with aging as an enhancer of the aging process.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders have commonly targeted individual aspects of the disease pathogenesis to little success. Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are characterized by several pathological features. In AD and PD, there is an abnormal accumulation of toxic proteins, increased inflammation, decreased synaptic function, neuronal loss, increased astrocyte activation, and perhaps a state of insulin resistance. Epidemiological evidence has revealed a link between AD/PD and type 2 diabetes mellitus, with these disorders sharing some pathological commonalities. Such a link has opened up a promising avenue for repurposing antidiabetic agents in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. A successful therapeutic strategy for AD/PD would likely require a single or several agents which target the separate pathological processes in the disease. Targeting cerebral insulin signalling produces numerous neuroprotective effects in preclinical AD/PD brain models. Clinical trials have shown the promise of approved diabetic compounds in improving motor symptoms of PD and preventing neurodegenerative decline, with numerous further phase II trials and phase III trials underway in AD and PD populations. Alongside insulin signalling, targeting incretin receptors in the brain represents one of the most promising strategies for repurposing currently available agents for the treatment of AD/PD. Most notably, glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have displayed impressive clinical potential in preclinical and early clinical studies. In AD the GLP-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, has been demonstrated to improve cerebral glucose metabolism and functional connectivity in small-scale pilot trials. Whilst in PD, the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide is effective in restoring motor function and cognition. Targeting brain incretin receptors reduces inflammation, inhibits apoptosis, prevents toxic protein aggregation, enhances long-term potentiation and autophagy as well as restores dysfunctional insulin signalling. Support is also increasing for the use of additional approved diabetic treatments, including intranasal insulin, metformin hydrochloride, peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptor γ agonists, amylin analogs, and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitors which are in the investigation for deployment in PD and AD treatment. As such, we provide a comprehensive review of several promising anti-diabetic agents for the treatment of AD and PD.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is a multifactorial biological process leading to a progressive decline of physiological functions. The process of ageing includes numerous changes in the cells and the interactions between cell-cell and cell-microenvironment remaining as a critical risk factor for the development of chronic degenerative diseases. Systemic inflammation, known as inflammageing, increases as a consequence of ageing contributing to age-related morbidities. But also, persistent and uncontrolled activation of fibrotic pathways, with excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and organ dysfunction is markedly more frequent in the elderly. In this context, we introduce here the concept of Fibroageing, that is, the propensity to develop tissue fibrosis associated with ageing, and propose that ECM is a key player underlying this process. During ageing, molecules of the ECM become damaged through many modifications including glycation, crosslinking, and accumulation, leading to matrix stiffness which intensifies ageing-associated alterations. We provide a framework with some mechanistic hypotheses proposing that stiff ECM, in addition to the well-known activation of fibrotic positive feedback loops, affect several of the hallmarks of ageing, such as cell senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction, and in this context, is a key mechanism and a driver thread of Fibroageing.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for more than 50 million patients worldwide. Current evidence suggests the exact mechanism behind this devastating disease to be of multifactorial origin, which seriously complicates the quest for an effective disease-modifying therapy, as well as impedes the search for strategic preventative measures. Of interest, preclinical studies point to serotonergic alterations, either induced via selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin receptor (ant)agonists, in mitigating AD brain neuropathology next to its clinical symptoms, the latter being supported by a handful of human intervention trials. Additionally, a substantial amount of preclinical trials highlight the potential of diet, fecal microbiota transplantations, as well as pre- and probiotics in modulating the brain’s serotonergic neurotransmitter system, starting from the gut. Whether such interventions could truly prevent, reverse or slow down AD progression likewise, should be initially tested in preclinical studies with AD mouse models, including sufficient analytical measurements both in gut and brain. Thereafter, its potential therapeutic effect could be confirmed in rigorously randomized controlled trials in humans, preferentially across the Alzheimer’s continuum, but especially from the prodromal up to the mild stages, where both high adherence to such therapies, as well as sufficient room for noticeable enhancement are feasible still. In the end, such studies might aid in the development of a comprehensive approach to tackle this complex multifactorial disease, since serotonin and its derivatives across the microbiota-gut-brain axis might serve as possible biomarkers of disease progression, next to forming a valuable target in AD drug development. In this narrative review, the available evidence concerning the orchestrating role of serotonin within the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the development of AD is summarized and discussed, and general considerations for future studies are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "The protein Klotho (KL) was first discovered in KL-deficient mice, which developed a syndrome similar to premature aging in humans. Since then, KL has been implicated in multiple molecular signaling pathways and diseases. KL has been shown to have anti-aging, healthspan and lifespan extending, cognitive enhancing, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor properties. KL levels decrease with age and in many diseases. Therefore, it has been of great interest to develop a KL-boosting or restoring drug, or to supplement endogenous Klotho with exogenous Klotho genetic material or recombinant Klotho protein, and to use KL levels in the body as a marker for the efficacy of such drugs and as a biomarker for the diagnosis and management of diseases. The goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of KL levels across age groups in individuals who are healthy or have certain health conditions, using four sources: blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and whole biopsy/necropsy tissue. By doing so, baseline KL levels can be identified across the lifespan, in the absence or presence of disease. In turn, these findings can be used to guide the development of future KL-based therapeutics and biomarkers, which will heavily rely on an individual's baseline KL range to be efficacious. A total of 65 studies were collected primarily using the PubMed database. Research articles that were published up to April 2022 were included. Statistical analysis was conducted using RStudio. Mean and median blood KL levels in healthy individuals, mean blood KL levels in individuals with renal conditions, and mean blood KL levels in individuals with metabolic or endocrine conditions were shown to decrease with age. Similarly, CSF KL levels in patients with AD also declined compared with age-matched controls. The present study confirms the trend that KL levels in blood decrease with age in humans, among those who are healthy, and even further among those with renal and endocrine/metabolic illnesses. Further, by drawing this trend from multiple published works, we were able to provide a general idea of baseline KL ranges, specifically in blood in these populations. These data add to the current knowledge on normal KL levels in the body and how they change with time and in disease, and can potentially support efforts to create KL-based treatments and screening tools to better manage aging, renal, and metabolic/endocrine diseases.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are the most common causes of disability worldwide. Given their high prevalence, devastating symptoms, and lack of definitive diagnostic tests, there is an urgent need to identify potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as powerful regulatory molecules in neurodegenerative diseases. Among them, lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) has been reported to be upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, whether this is part of a protective or harmful mechanism is still unclear. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the role of NEAT1 in neurodegenerative diseases and its association with the characteristic aggregation of misfolded proteins: amyloid-β and tau in AD, α-synuclein in PD, mutant huntingtin in HD, and TAR DNA-binding protein-43 fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma in ALS. The aim of this review is to stimulate further research on more precise and effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "As the proportion of aging people in our population increases steadily, global strategies accompanied by extensive research are necessary to tackle society and health service challenges. The World Health Organization recently published an action plan: \"Decade of healthy aging 2020-2030\", which calls for concerted collaboration to prevent poverty of older people to provide quality education, job opportunities, and an age-inclusive infrastructure. However, scientists worldwide still struggle to find definitions and appropriate measurements of aging per se and healthy aging in particular. This literature review aims to compile concepts of healthy aging and provide a condensed overview of the challenges in defining and measuring it, along with suggestions for further research.We conducted three independent systematic literature searches covering the main scopes addressed in this review: (1) concepts and definitions of healthy aging, (2) outcomes and measures in (healthy) aging studies and (3) scores and indices of healthy aging. For each scope, the retrieved literature body was screened and subsequently synthesized.We provide a historical overview of the concepts of healthy aging over the past 60 years. Furthermore, we identifiy current difficulties in identifying healthy agers, including dichotomous measurements, illness-centered views, study populations & designs. Secondly, markers and measures of healthy aging are discussed, including points to consider, like plausibility, consistency, and robustness. Finally, we present healthy aging scores as measurements, which combine multiple aspects to avoid a dichotomous categorization and display the bio-psycho-social concept of healthy aging.When deducting research, scientists need to consider the diverse challenges in defining and measuring healthy aging. Considering that, we recommend scores that combine multiple aspects of healthy aging, such as the Healthy Ageing Index or the ATHLOS score, among others. Further efforts are to be made on a harmonized definition of healthy aging and validated measuring instruments that are modular, easy to apply and provide comparable results in different studies and cohorts to enhance the generalization of results.",

Moreover, the tight junction of the brain, blood-brain barrier (BBB)has a protective feature, functioning as a biological barrier that can prevent medicines, toxins, and foreign substances from entering the brain. However, delivering any medicinal agent to the brain in NDs (i.e., Multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, etc.) is enormously challenging. There are many approved therapies to address NDs, but most of them only help treat the associated manifestations. The available therapies have failed to control the progression of NDs due to certain factors, i.e., BBB and drug-associated undesirable effects. NDs have extremely complex pathology, with many pathogenic mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression; thereby, a limited survival rate has been observed in ND patients. Hence, understanding the exact mechanism behind NDs is crucial to developing alternative approaches for improving ND patients' survival rates. Thus, the present review sheds light on different cellular mechanisms involved in NDs and novel therapeutic approaches with their clinical relevance, which will assist researchers in developing alternate strategies to address the limitations of conventional ND therapies. The current work offers the scope into the near future to improve the therapeutic approach of NDs.",

    "abstract": "The potential role of Tai Chi in improving sarcopenia and frailty has been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effect of Tai Chi on muscle mass, muscle strength, physical function, and other geriatric syndromes in elderly individuals with sarcopenia and frailty.Systematic searches of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Medline databases for RCTs published between 1989 and 2022 were conducted; the database searchers were supplemented with manual reference searches. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the study was designed as a RCT; (2) Tai Chi was one of the intervention arms; (3) the participants had a minimum age of ≥ 60 years and were diagnosed with frailty or sarcopenia, and the diagnostic guidelines or criteria were mentioned; (4) the number of participants in each arm was ≥ 10; and (5) the outcome reports included ≥ 1 item from the following primary or secondary outcomes. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) non-RCT studies; (2) nonhuman subjects; (3) participants aged < 60 years; (4) no description of the diagnostic guidelines or criteria for frailty or sarcopenia in the text; and (5) reported outcomes not among the following primary or secondary outcomes. The primary outcomes were muscle mass, grip strength and muscle performance (gait speed, 30-second chair stand test (30CST), sit-to-stand test (SST), Timed up and go test (TUGT), balance, and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)). The secondary outcomes included the number of falls and fear of falling (FOF), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and depression and quality of life (QOL) assessments.Eleven RCTs were conducted from 1996 to 2022 in 5 countries that investigated 1676 sarcopenic or frail elderly individuals were included in the review. There were 804 participants in the Tai Chi exercise cohort and 872 participants in the control cohort (nonexercised (n = 5)/ exercise (n = 8)). The mean age of participants was 70-89.5 years and the numbers of participants from each arm in each study were 10-158. The majority of the participants practiced Yang-style Tai Chi (n = 9), and the numbers of movement ranged from 6 to 24. The prescriptions of training were 8-48 weeks, 2-7 sessions per weeks, and 30-90 min per session. Most studies used Tai Chi expert as instructor (n = 8). The lengths of follow-up period were 8-48 weeks. The results from our meta-analysis revealed significant improvements for Tai Chi compared to control group (nonexercise/ exercise) on measures of the 30CST (weighted mean difference (WMD): 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50-3.21, p < 0.00001, I2 = 87%), the TUGT (WMD: -0.72, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.34, p = 0.0002, I2 =0%), numbers of fall (WMD: -0.41, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.17, p = 0.0006, I2 =0%) and FOF (standardized MD (SMD): -0.50, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.22, p = 0.0006, I2 = 57%); and for Tai Chi compared to 'nonexercise' controls on measures of SST (WMD: -2.20, 95% CI -2.22 to -2.18, p < 0.00001), balance (SMD: 9.85, 95% CI 8.88-10.82, p < 0.00001), DBP (WMD: -7.00, 95% CI -7.35 to -6.65, p < 0.00001), MMSE (WMD: 1.91, 95% CI 1.73-2.09, p < 0.00001, I2 =0%), depression (SMD: -1.37, 95% CI -1.91 to -0.83, p < 0.00001) and QOL (SMD: 10.72, 95% CI 9.38-12.07, p < 0.00001). There were no significant differences between Tai Chi and control groups on any of the remaining 4 comparisons: body muscle mass (WMD: 0.53, 95% CI -0.18 to 1.24; P = 0.14; I2 =0%), grip strength (WMD: -0.06, 95% CI -1.98 to 1.86; P = 0.95; I2 =0%), gait speed (WMD: 0.05, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.20; P = 0.55; I2 =99%), and SPPB (WMD: 0.55, 95% CI -0.04 to 1.14; P = 0.07). The variables of bias summary, Tai Chi instructor, Tai Chi movements, and Tai Chi training duration without significant association with the 30CST or the TUGT through meta-regression analyses.Our results demonstrated that patients with frailty or sarcopenia who practiced Tai Chi exhibited improved physical performance in the 30-second chair stand test, the Timed up and go test, number of falls and fear of falling. However, there was no difference in muscle mass, grip strength, gait speed, or Short Physical Performance Battery score between the Tai Chi and control groups. Improvements in the sit-to-stand test, balance, diastolic blood pressure, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and depression and quality of life assessments were found when comparing the Tai Chi cohort to the nonexercise control cohort rather than the exercise control cohort. To explore the effectiveness of Tai Chi in sarcopenic and frail elderly individuals more comprehensively, a standardized Tai Chi training prescription and a detailed description of the study design are suggested for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Telomere attrition is considered a hallmark of ageing. Untangling the proximate causes of telomere attrition may therefore reveal important aspects about the ageing process. In a landmark paper in 2002 Thomas von Zglinicki demonstrated that oxidative stress accelerates telomere attrition in cell culture. In the next 20 years, oxidative stress became firmly embedded into modern theories of ageing and telomere attrition. However, a recent surge of in vivo studies reveals an inconsistent pattern questioning the unequivocal role of oxidative stress in telomere length and telomere attrition (henceforth referred to as telomere dynamics), in living organisms. Here we report the results of the first formal meta-analysis on the association between oxidative stress and telomere dynamics in vivo, representing 37 studies, 4969 individuals, and 18,677 correlational measurements. The overall correlation between oxidative stress markers and telomere dynamics was indistinguishable from zero (r = 0.027). This result was independent of the type of oxidative stress marker, telomere dynamic, or taxonomic group. However, telomere measurement method affected the analysis and the subset of TRF-based studies showed a significant overall correlation (r = 0.09), supporting the prediction that oxidative stress accelerates telomere attrition. The correlation was more pronounced in short-lived species and during the adult life phase, when ageing becomes apparent. We then performed an additional meta-analysis of interventional studies (n = 7) manipulating oxidative stress. This revealed a significant effect of treatment on telomere dynamics (d=0.36). Our findings provide new support for the hypothesis that oxidative stress causes telomere attrition in living organisms.",

    "abstract": "As a severe public health issue, hearing loss has caused an increasingly disease burden, especially in the elderly population. Hearing loss may inevitably induce asymmetric hearing, which makes it difficult for elderly individuals to locate sound sources, therefore resulting in increased postural instability and falling risk. To emphasize the public health emergence of hearing loss, we investigated the temporal trend of prevalence of hearing loss over the last 30 years and further predicted its changes in the next 20 years, decomposed the trend according to demographic factors and epidemiological changes, and quantified the cross-country healthy inequalities, using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. In 2019, there were more than 140 million cases of hearing loss worldwide, a 93.89% increase from 70 million cases in 1990. The age-standardized rate (ASR) also increased with an estimated annual percentage change of 0.08% per year. Population growth and aging are the major drivers contributing to the changes, accounting for 60.83% and 35.35%. Of note, the contribution of aging varies showing a gradual increasing trend with sociodemographic index (SDI) elevating. Also notable, there were significant health inequalities across 204 countries and territories, with slope index of inequality rising over time. Projection of the global burden of hearing loss from 2020 to 2040 indicated progressive increases in both case number and ASR. These reflect the heavy disease burden of hearing loss that needed more targeted and efficient strategies in its prevention and management.",

In recent years, several lines of evidence have suggested that individuals with MDD have an elevated risk of age-related adverse outcomes across the lifespan. This review provided evidence of a significant overlap between the biological abnormalities in MDD and biological changes commonly observed during the aging process (i.e., hallmarks of biological aging). Based on such evidence, we formulate a mechanistic model showing how abnormalities in the hallmarks of biological aging can be a common denominator and mediate the elevated risk of age-related health outcomes commonly observed in MDD. Finally, we proposed a roadmap for novel studies to investigate the intersection between the biology of aging and MDD, including the use of geroscience-guided interventions, such as senolytics, to delay or improve major depression by targeting biological aging.",

Recent studies point out the involvement of exosomes, a type of small bilipid layer-enclosed extracellular vesicles, in regulating neurotransmission. Through horizontally transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, exosomes can modulate synaptic activities rapidly by controlling neurotransmitter release or progressively by regulating neural plasticity including synapse formation, neurite growth & removal, and axon guidance & elongation. In this review, we summarize the similarities and differences between exosomes and synaptic vesicles in their biogenesis, contents, and release. We also highlight the recent progress made in demonstrating the biological roles of exosome in regulating neurotransmission, and propose a modified model of neurotransmission, in which exosomes act as novel neurotransmitters. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive discussion of the enlightenment of the current knowledge on neurotransmission to the future directions of exosome research.",

The aim of the study is to review evidence about feasibility, acceptability and clinical effectiveness of socially assistive robots used for people with dementia.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINHAL, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and EI Engineering Village from inception to 04 - 02-2022 - included primary studies assessing feasibility, acceptability, or effectiveness of socially assistive robots for people with dementia. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility, and assessed quality. Narrative synthesis prioritized higher quality studies, and random-effect meta-analyses compared robots with usual care (UC) or active control (AC) immediately after the intervention (short-term; ST) or long-term (LT) on cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life.66 studies and four categories of robots were eligible: Companion robots (Pet and humanoid companion robots), telepresence communication robots, homecare assistive robots and multifunctional robots. PARO (companion robot seal) was feasible and acceptable but limited by its weight, cost, and sound. On meta-analysis, PARO had no ST or LT compared to UC or AC over 5-12 weeks on agitation (ST vs UC, 4 trials, 153 participants: pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.25; - 0.57 to 0.06; LT vs UC; 2 trials, 77 participants, SMD = -0.24; - 0.94, 0.46), cognition (ST vs UC, 3 trials, 128 participants: SMD= 0.03; -0.32, 0.38), overall neuropsychiatric symptoms (ST vs UC, 3 trials, 169 participants: SMD= -0.01; -0.32, 0.29; ST vs AC, 2 trials, 145 participants: SMD =0.02, -0.71, 0.85), apathy (ST vs AC, 2 trials, 81 participants: SMD= 0.14; 0.29, 0.58), depression (ST vs UC, 4 trials, 181 participants; SMD= 0.08; -0.52, 0.69; LT vs UC: 2 trials, 77 participants: SMD =0.01; -0.75, 0.77), anxiety (ST vs UC: 2 trials, 104 participants, SMD= 0.24; -0.85, 1.33) and quality of life (ST vs UC, 2 trials, 127 participants: SMD=-0.05; -0.52, 0.42; ST vs AC: 2 trials, 159 participants, SMD =-0.36, -0.76, 0.05). Robotic animals, humanoid companion robots, telepresence robots and multifunctional robots were feasible and acceptable. However, humanoid companion robots have speech recognition problems, and telepresence robots and multifunctional robots were often difficult to use. There was mixed evidence about the feasibility of homecare robots. There was little evidence on any of these robots' effectiveness.Although robots were generally feasible and acceptable, there is no clear evidence that people with dementia derive benefit from robots for cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or quality of life. We recommend that future research should use high quality designs to establish evidence of effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a common cause of joint-related chronic disability in elderly individuals worldwide. It seriously impacts the quality of life and inflicts a substantial social and economic burden. The pathological mechanisms underlying IDD have not been fully revealed, leading to less satisfactory clinical treatment outcomes. More studies are urgently needed to reveal its precise pathological mechanisms. Numerous studies have revealed that inflammation is closely related to various pathological processes of IDD, including the continuous loss of extracellular matrix, cell apoptosis, and senescence, indicating the important role of inflammation in the pathological mechanism of IDD. Epigenetic modifications affect the functions and characteristics of genes mainly through DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding RNA regulation, and other mechanisms, thus having a major effect on the survival state of the body. Recently, the role of epigenetic modifications in inflammation during IDD has been attracting research interest. In this review, we summarize the roles of different types of epigenetic modifications in inflammation during IDD in recent years, to improve our understanding of the etiology of IDD and to transform basic research strategy into a clinically effective treatment for joint-related chronic disability in elderly individuals.",

In the light of global population ageing, the prevalence of frailty is expected to soar in coming decades. This narrative review provides critical insights into recent developments and emerging practices in frailty research regarding identification, management, risk factors, and prevention. We searched journals in the top two quartiles of geriatrics and gerontology (from Clarivate Journal Citation Reports) for articles published between 01 January 2018 and 20 December 2022. Several recent developments were identified, including new biomarkers and biomarker panels for frailty screening and diagnosis, using artificial intelligence to identify frailty, and investigating the altered response to medications by older adults with frailty. Other areas with novel developments included exercise (including technology-based exercise), multidimensional interventions, person-centred and integrated care, assistive technologies, analysis of frailty transitions, risk-factors, clinical guidelines, COVID-19, and potential future treatments. This review identified a strong need for the implementation and evaluation of cost-effective, community-based interventions to manage and prevent frailty. Our findings highlight the need to better identify and support older adults with frailty and involve those with frailty in shared decision-making regarding their care.",

However, few meta-analyses have assessed the cognitive benefits associated with all FITT-VP variables (exercise frequency, intensity, bout duration time, type, volume or total intervention length, and progression) in healthy populations by age. Thus, this meta-analysis assessed the effects of each FITT-VP variable on cognitive function in healthy children, adults, and older adults. This study followed PRISMA guidelines. After searching PubMed and the Web of Science, we included 54 randomized controlled trials to examined the effects of FITT-VP variables on five cognitive domains: global cognition, executive function, memory, attention, and information processing. Moderation analyses assessed the effects by age and by each exercise variables. Exercise benefitted overall cognition and all subcognitive domains. Aerobic and resistance exercise showed the greatest benefits on global cognition and executive function respectively, whereas mind-body exercise benefitted memory. Among all populations, older adults showed the greatest benefits of exercise on global cognition, executive function, and memory compared with controls. Additional studies are needed to assess the effects of exercise on attention and information processing. This meta-analysis offers new insights on the relationships between cognition and FITT-VP exercise variables in healthy populations.",

Oxidative stress has been associated with inflammation in the intervertebral disc, cellular senescence, autophagy, and epigenetics of intervertebral disc cells. It and the above pathological mechanisms are closely linked through the common hub reactive oxygen species(ROS), and promote each other in the process of disc degeneration and promote the development of the disease. This reveals the important role of oxidative stress in the process of IDD, and the importance and great potential of IDD therapy targeting oxidative stress. The efficacy of traditional therapy is unstable or cannot be maintained. In recent years, due to the rise of materials science, many bioactive functional materials have been applied in the treatment of IDD, and through the combination with traditional drugs, satisfactory efficacy has been achieved. At present, the research review of antioxidant bioactive materials in the treatment of IDD is not complete. Based on the existing studies, the mechanism of oxidative stress in IDD and the common antioxidant therapy were summarized in this paper, and the strategies based on emerging bioactive materials were reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer stands as the primary contributor to cancer-related fatalities worldwide, affecting both genders. Two primary types exist where non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounts for 80–85% and SCLC accounts for 10-15% of cases. NSCLC subtypes include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Smoking, second-hand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, and other pollutants, genetic predisposition, and COPD are lung cancer risk factors. On the other hand, stresses such as DNA damage, telomere shortening, and oncogene activation cause a prolonged cell cycle halt, known as senescence. Despite its initial role as a tumor-suppressing mechanism that slows cell growth, excessive or improper control of this process can cause age-related diseases, including cancer. Cellular senescence has two purposes in lung cancer. Researchers report that senescence slows tumor growth by constraining multiplication of impaired cells. However, senescent cells also demonstrate the pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is widely reported to promote cancer. This review will look at the role of cellular senescence in lung cancer, describe its diagnostic markers, ask about current treatments to control it, look at case studies and clinical trials that show how senescence-targeting therapies can be used in lung cancer, and talk about problems currently being faced, and possible solutions for the same in the future.",

    "abstract": "This commentary provides a novel synthesis of how biological systems adapt to a broad spectrum of environmental and age-related stresses that are underlying causes of numerous degenerative diseases and debilitating effects of aging. It proposes that the most fundamental, evolutionary-based integrative strategy to sustain and protect health is based on the concept of hormesis. This concept integrates anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and cellular repair responses at all levels of biological organization (i.e., cell, organ and organism) within the framework of biphasic dose responses that describe the quantitative limits of biological plasticity in all cells and organisms from bacteria and plants to humans. A major feature of the hormetic concept is that low levels of biological, chemical, physical and psychological stress upregulate adaptive responses that not only precondition, repair and restore normal functions to damaged tissues/organs but modestly overcompensate, reducing ongoing background damage, thereby enhancing health beyond that in control groups, lacking the low level \"beneficial\" stress. Higher doses of such stress often become counterproductive and eventually harmful. Hormesis is active throughout the life-cycle and can be diminished by aging processes affecting the onset and severity of debilitating conditions/diseases, especially in elderly subjects. The most significant feature of the hormetic dose response is that the limits of biological plasticity for adaptive processes are less than twice that of control group responses, with most, at maximum, being 30-60 % greater than control group values. Yet, these modest increases can make the difference between health or disease and living or dying. The quantitative features of these adaptive hormetic dose responses are also independent of mechanism. These features of the hormetic dose response determine the capacity to which systems can adapt/be protected, the extent to which biological performance (e.g., memory, resistance to injury/disease, wound healing, hair growth or lifespan) can be enhanced/extended and the extent to which synergistic interactions may occur. Hormesis defines the quantitative rules within which adaptive processes operate and is central to evolution and biology and should become transformational for experimental concepts and study design strategies, public health practices and a vast range of therapeutic strategies and interventions.",

Transitions within frailty status would be influenced by the presence of sarcopenia. Investigating their association to devise efficacious intervention and management strategies for geriatric patients is imperative, given their potentially unfavorable outcomes. In this study, the literature on sarcopenia and frailty was screened in the Web of Science core collection database over the past 30 years to ascertain the link between them through bibliometric analysis and the exploration of disease-related molecular pathways within the GeneCards and OMIM databases was conducted. Per inclusion and exclusion criteria, 3889 literature sources were selected for subsequent analysis. Keywords, including \"cirrhosis\" and \"postoperative complications,\" represent the current and potential future research trends and focal points in this field. Moreover, 63 common potential targets between the two diseases were identified. Their pathogenesis involved cellular aging and endocrine metabolism regulation pathways, including AMPK, cell senescence, and the endocrine resistance pathway. This study identified an intimate correlation between frailty and sarcopenia in pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment measures, establishing a foundation for exploring shared prevention and treatment strategies for these two disorders.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most frequent type of dementia in elderly people. Two major forms of the disease exist: sporadic - the causes of which have not yet been fully understood - and familial - inherited within families from generation to generation, with a clear autosomal dominant transmission of mutations in Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), 2 (PSEN2) or Amyloid Precursors Protein (APP) genes. The main hallmark of AD consists of extracellular deposits of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide and intracellular deposits of the hyperphosphorylated form of the tau protein. An ever-growing body of research supports the viral infectious hypothesis of sporadic forms of AD. In particular, it has been shown that several herpes viruses (i.e., HHV-1, HHV-2, HHV-3 or varicella zoster virus, HHV-4 or Epstein Barr virus, HHV-5 or cytomegalovirus, HHV-6A and B, HHV-7), flaviviruses (i.e., Zika virus, Dengue fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus) as well as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV), SARS-CoV2, Ljungan virus (LV), Influenza A virus and Borna disease virus, could increase the risk of AD. Here, we summarized and discussed these results. Based on these findings, significant issues for future studies are also put forward.",

The risk of bias and the quality of evidence were assessed using the Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Initially, 6503 records were considered and screened after removing duplicates (n= 1321). Subsequently, 81 full texts were assessed for eligibility. Four articles met the inclusion criteria but 2 of them were merged as they were describing different outcomes of the same research project. Consequently, 3 overall studies with a total of 130 participants were included in the final analysis. Due to the high heterogeneity in the methodology and outcome measures employed, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis. Included studies used semi-immersive (k=2) and full-immersive (k=1) VR systems in their research. Two articles evaluated overall cognitive function through the MoCA together with specific tests for executive functions (n=69), while one study adopted a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to evaluate both cognitive function and executive function (n=61). Finally, one study evaluated functional status through instrumental activities of daily living (n=34). A However, the limited number of studies, the small sample size, and the potential issues with the quality and methodology of these studies that emerged from the risk of bias assessment may raise doubts about the reliability of their results. Nevertheless, although scarce, results of the present review suggest that VR-CRT may be paramount in treating MCI for its additional ecological and adaptive advantages, as all of the studies highlighted that it was at least as effective as conventional CRT for all the outcome measures. Therefore, more rigorous research that compares VR-CRT and CRT is needed to understand the degree to which VR-CRT is effective with older adults with MCI and the potential role of immersion to influence its efficacy. Indeed, these preliminary findings highlight the need for the development of standardized VR protocols, as the integration of such technology into clinical practice may help improve the quality of life and cognitive outcomes for this growing demographic.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit for the fountain of youth has long been a fascination amongst scientists and humanity. Ageing is broadly characterized by a cellular decline with increased susceptibility to age-related diseases, being intimately associated with epigenetic modifications. Recently, reprogramming-induced rejuvenation strategies have begun to greatly alter longevity research not only to tackle age-related defects but also to possibly reverse the cellular ageing process. Hence, in this review, we highlight the major epigenetic changes during ageing and the state-of-art of the current emerging epigenetic reprogramming strategies leveraging on transcription factors. Notably, partial reprogramming enables the resetting of the ageing clock without erasing cellular identity. Promising chemical-based rejuvenation strategies harnessing small molecules, including DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors are also discussed. Moreover, in parallel to longevity interventions, the foundations of epigenetic clocks for accurate ageing assessment and evaluation of reprogramming approaches are briefly presented. Going further, with such scientific breakthroughs, we are witnessing a rise in the longevity biotech industry aiming to extend the health span and ideally achieve human rejuvenation one day. In this context, we overview the main scenarios proposed for the future of the socio-economic and ethical challenges associated with such an emerging field. Ultimately, this review aims to inspire future research on interventions that promote healthy ageing for all.",

Despite many failures in developing AD treatment during the past 20 years, significant advances have been achieved in passive immunotherapy of AD very recently. Here, we review characteristics, clinical trial data, and mechanisms of action for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting key players in AD pathogenesis, including amyloid-β (Aβ), tau and neuroinflammation modulators. We emphasized the efficacy of lecanemab and donanemab on cognition and amyloid clearance in AD patients in phase III clinical trials and discussed factors that may contribute to the efficacy and side effects of anti-Aβ mAbs. In addition, we provided important information on mAbs targeting tau or inflammatory regulators in clinical trials, and indicated that mAbs against the mid-region of tau or pathogenic tau have therapeutic potential for AD. In conclusion, passive immunotherapy targeting key players in AD pathogenesis offers a promising strategy for effective AD treatment.",

Previous meta-analyses were less comprehensive. We included cohort studies with participants without dementia and with hearing assessments at baseline, minimum 2 years follow-up and incident cognitive outcomes. We used random-effect models and subgroup and meta-regression on moderator analyses. We identified fifty studies (N=1,548,754). Hearing loss (yes/no) was associated with incident dementia risk (HR=1.35 [95% CI = 1.26 – 1.45), mild cognitive impairment (MCI HR=1.29 [95% CI = 1.11 – 1.50]), cognitive decline not specified as MCI or dementia (HR=1.29 [95% CI = 1.17 – 1.42]), and Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD, HR=1.56 [95% CI = 1.30 – 1.87]), but not with vascular dementia (HR, 1.30 [95% CI = 0.83 – 2.05]). Each 10-decibel worsening of hearing was associated with a 16% increase in dementia risk (95% CI = 1.07 – 1.27). The effect of hearing loss did not vary across potential moderators. Cohort studies consistently support that adult-onset hearing loss increases the risk of incident cognitive decline, dementia, MCI, and ADD.",

VaD is synonymous with ageing, and its symptoms place a significant burden on the health and wellbeing of older people. Despite the identification of a substantial number of risk factors for VaD, the pathological mechanisms underpinning this disease remain to be fully elucidated. Consequently, a biogerontological imperative exists to highlight the modifiable lifestyle factors which can mitigate against the risk of developing VaD. This review will critically examine some of the factors which have been revealed to modulate VaD risk. The survey commences by providing an overview of the putative mechanisms which are associated with the pathobiology of VaD. Next, the factors which influence the risk of developing VaD are examined. Finally, emerging treatment avenues including epigenetics, the gut microbiome, and pro-longevity pharmaceuticals are discussed. By drawing this key evidence together, it is our hope that it can be used to inform future experimental investigations in this field.",

    "abstract": "Ageing is a highly complex process marked by a temporal cascade of events, which promote alterations in the normal functioning of an individual organism. The triggers of normal brain ageing are not well understood, even less so the factors which initiate and steer the neuronal degeneration, which underpin disorders such as dementia. A wealth of data on how nutrients and diets may support cognitive function and preserve brain health are available, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying their biological action in both normal ageing, age-related cognitive decline, and in the development of neurodegenerative disorders have not been clearly elucidated. This review aims to summarise the current state of knowledge of vulnerabilities that predispose towards dysfunctional brain ageing, highlight potential protective mechanisms, and discuss dietary interventions that may be used as therapies. A special focus of this paper is on the impact of nutrition on neuroprotection and the underlying molecular mechanisms, and this focus reflects the discussions held during the 2nd workshop 'Nutrition for the Ageing Brain: Functional Aspects and Mechanisms' in Copenhagen in June 2016. The present review is the most recent in a series produced by the Nutrition and Mental Performance Task Force under the auspice of the International Life Sciences Institute Europe (ILSI Europe). Coupling studies of cognitive ageing with studies investigating the effect of nutrition and dietary interventions as strategies targeting specific mechanisms, such as neurogenesis, protein clearance, inflammation, and non-coding and microRNAs is of high value. Future research on the impact of nutrition on cognitive ageing will need to adopt a longitudinal approach and multimodal nutritional interventions will likely need to be imposed in early-life to observe significant impact in older age.",

    "abstract": "As human life expectancy keeps increasing, ageing populations present a growing challenge for clinical practices. Human ageing is associated with molecular, structural, and functional changes in a variety of organ systems, including the kidney. During the ageing process, the kidney experiences progressive functional decline as well as macroscopic and microscopic histological alterations, which are accentuated by systemic comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes mellitus, or by preexisting or underlying kidney diseases. Although ageing per se does not cause kidney injury, physiologic changes associated with normal ageing processes are likely to impair the reparative capacity of the kidney and thus predispose older people to acute kidney disease, chronic kidney disease and other renal diseases. Mechanistically, cell senescence plays a key role in renal ageing, involving a number of cellular signaling mechanisms, many of which may be harnessed as international targets for slowing or even reversing kidney ageing. This review summarizes the clinical characteristics of renal ageing, highlights the latest progresses in deciphering the role of cell senescence in renal ageing, and envisages potential interventional strategies and novel therapeutic targets for preventing or improving renal ageing in the hope of maintaining long-term kidney health and function across the life course.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity has received substantial research attention due to its beneficial impact on cognition in ageing, particularly via the action of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It is well established that physical activity can elevate circulating levels of BDNF, and that BDNF has neurotrophic, neuroprotective and cognitively beneficial properties. Yet, practical implementation of this knowledge is limited by a lack of clarity on context and dose-effect. Against a shifting backdrop of gradually diminishing physical and cognitive capacity in normal ageing, the type, intensity, and duration of physical activity required to elicit elevations in BDNF, and more importantly, the magnitude of BDNF elevation required for detectable neuroprotection remains poorly characterised. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the association between physical activity, BDNF, and cognition, with a focus on clarifying the magnitude of these effects in the context of normative ageing. We discuss the implications of the available evidence for the design of physical activity interventions intended to promote healthy cognitive ageing.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the benefits and harms of exercise therapy on physical and psychosocial health in people with multimorbidity. Design: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINAHL from 1990 to April 20th, 2020 and Cochrane reviews on the effect of exercise therapy for each of the aforementioned conditions, reference lists of the included studies, the WHO registry and citation tracking on included studies in Web of Science. Eligibility criteria for study selection: RCTs investigating the benefit of exercise therapy in people with multimorbidity, defined as two or more of the following conditions: osteoarthritis (of the knee or hip), hypertension, type 2 diabetes, depression, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on at least one of the following outcomes: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical function, depression or anxiety. Summary and quality of the evidence: Meta-analyses using a random-effects model to assess the benefit of exercise therapy and the risk of non-serious and serious adverse events according to the Food and Drug Administration definition. Meta-regression analyses to investigate the impact of pre-specified mediators of effect estimates. Cochrane ‘Risk of Bias Tool’ 2.0 and the GRADE assessment to evaluate the overall quality of evidence. Results: Twenty-three RCTs with 3363 people, testing an exercise therapy intervention (mean duration 13.0 weeks, SD 4.0) showed that exercise therapy improved HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.37, 95 % CI 0.14 to 0.61) and objectively measured physical function (SMD 0.33, 95 % CI 0.17 to 0.49), and reduced depression symptoms (SMD -0.80, 95 % CI -1.21 to -0.40) and anxiety symptoms (SMD -0.49, 95 % CI -0.99 to 0.01). Exercise therapy was not associated with an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (risk ratio 0.96, 95 % CI 0.53–1.76). By contrast, exercise therapy was associated with a reduced risk of serious adverse events (risk ratio 0.62, 95 % CI 0.49 to 0.78). Meta-regression showed that increasing age was associated with lower effect sizes for HRQoL and greater baseline depression severity was associated with greater reduction of depression symptoms. The overall quality of evidence for all the outcomes was downgraded to low, mainly due to risk of bias, inconsistency and indirectness. Conclusions: Exercise therapy appears to be safe and to have a beneficial effect on physical and psychosocial health in people with multimorbidity. Although the evidence supporting this was of low quality, it highlights the potential of exercise therapy in the management and care of this population.",

Genetic and lifestyle factors are assumed to influence cognitive performance in ageing by affecting the magnitude and extent of age-related brain changes (i.e., brain maintenance or atrophy), as well as the ability to recruit compensatory processes. The purpose of this review is to present findings from the Betula study and other longitudinal studies, with a focus on clarifying the role of key biological and environmental factors assumed to underlie individual differences in brain and cognitive ageing. We discuss the vital importance of sampling, analytic methods, consideration of non-ignorable dropout, and related issues for valid conclusions on factors that influence healthy neurocognitive ageing.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a modifiable risk factor for most chronic diseases and an inevitable process in humans. The development of pharmacological interventions aimed at delaying or preventing the onset of chronic conditions and other age-related diseases has been at the forefront of the aging field. Preclinical findings have demonstrated that species, sex and strain confer significant heterogeneity on reaching the desired health- and lifespan-promoting pharmacological responses in model organisms. Translating the safety and efficacy of these interventions to humans and the lack of reliable biomarkers that serve as predictors of health outcomes remain a challenge. Here, we will survey current pharmacological interventions that promote lifespan extension and/or increased healthspan in animals and humans, and review the various anti-aging interventions selected for inclusion in the NIA's Interventions Testing Program as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov database that target aging or age-related diseases in humans.",

    "abstract": "Depression rates in older people worldwide vary from 10% to 15% of community-dwelling older persons. There are two others problems related to depression in old age, namely the high incidence of falls and the so-called fear of falling (FOF), with a prevalence ranging from 20% to 85%; it was initially considered a post-fall syndrome, which later as a fall-independent event. Study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to bridge the existing gap in literature about the association between depressive symptomatology, FOF, use of antidepressant therapy and falls, also identifying a possible effect of the study quality on the outcome. The selection of studies was carried out between May 20, 2020, and July 27, 2020 and only observational clinical trials, written in English, with participants aged more or equal to 60 years affected by diagnosis of depression or treatment for depression mentioned both as a clinical diagnosis in older patient, and as a predictor/consequence of falls were included. The systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and the protocol was recorded in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). The screening process ultimately led to the inclusion of 18 articles. Many of the included studies showed that depressive symptoms caused the subsequent increase in the number of falls. Results from the meta-analysis had no highlighted association between depression and falls, in contrast to other review and meta-analysis works: our work includes a substantial number of studies, with a relatively recent publication date, including patients diagnosed with depression, clearly evaluating the association between depression and falls. Results all seem to confirm the hypothesis of an interdependent association between the presence of FOF and the risk of fall, despite the high percentage of cross-sectional studies prevents inferring on the direction of the association. Therapeutic interventions aimed at decrease rate of falls reducing depressive symptoms and FOF.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied as potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their profiles have been analyzed in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue. However, due to the high variability between the reported data, stemming from the lack of methodological standardization and the heterogeneity of AD, the most promising miRNA biomarker candidates have not been selected. Our literature review shows that out of 137 miRNAs found to be altered in AD blood, 36 have been replicated in at least one independent study, and out of 166 miRNAs reported as differential in AD CSF, 13 have been repeatedly found. Only 3 miRNAs have been consistently reported as altered in three analyzed specimens: blood, CSF and the brain (hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-135a). Nonetheless, all 36 repeatedly differential miRNAs in AD blood are promising as components of the diagnostic panel. Given their predicted functions, such miRNA panel may report multiple pathways contributing to AD pathology, enabling the design of personalized therapies. In addition, the analysis revealed that the miRNAs dysregulated in AD overlap highly with miRNAs implicated in cancer. However, the directions of the miRNA changes are usually opposite in cancer and AD, indicative of an epigenetic trade-off between the two diseases.",

Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, although various causes and complex pathways have been proposed. Immune system alterations (immunosenescence and \"InflammAging\") have been suggested to contribute to frailty, but a precise causative role of such alterations remains to be determined. Genetic studies support the suggestion of immune system involvement in frailty: genetic variants in genes involved in immune system function have been associated with the syndrome. Interestingly, nutritional status, through its effects on cellular metabolism, may also influence the immune system, i.e. hormone and cytokine (mainly adipocytokine) levels, and immune cell populations and function, increasing inflammation and contributing to frailty. This review aims to discuss the role of immune system alterations in frailty, analyzing the role of genetic factors in frailty onset and the impact of diet on inflammation and, in turn, on frailty.",

Although rarely acknowledged these associations do not dictate causality. I review telomerase knockout and overexpression studies and find little support that telomeres cause aging. In addition, the causality hypothesis assumes that there is a critical telomere length at which senescence is induced. This generates the prediction that variance in telomere length decreases with age. In contrast, using meta-analysis of human data, I find no such decline. Inferring the causal involvement of telomeres in aging from current knowledge is therefore speculative and could hinder scientific progress.",

    "abstract": "Older people are at an increased risk of developing respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or lung infections. Susceptibility to these diseases is partly due to the intrinsic ageing process, characterized by genomic, cellular and metabolic hallmarks and immunosenescence, and is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota. Importantly, in the lungs, ageing is also associated with a dysbiosis and loss of resilience of the resident microbiota and alterations of the gut-lung axis. Notably, as malnutrition is often observed in the elderly, nutrition is one of the most accessible modifiable factors affecting both senescence and microbiota. This article reviews the changes affecting the lung and its resident microbiota during ageing, as well as the interconnections between malnutrition, senescence, microbiota, gut-lung axis and respiratory health. As the communication along the gut-lung axis becomes more permissive with ageing, this review also explores the evidence that the gut and lung microbiota are key players in the maintenance of healthy lungs, and as such, are potential targets for nutrition-based preventive strategies against lung disease in elderly populations.",

    "abstract": "The entorhinal-hippocampal system contains distinct networks subserving declarative memory. This system is selectively vulnerable to changes of ageing and pathological processes. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is a pivotal component of this memory system since it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the hippocampus. EC is heavily affected by the proteinopathies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These appear in a stereotypical spatiotemporal manner and include increased levels of intracellular amyloid-beta Aβ (iAβ), parenchymal deposition of Aβ plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) containing abnormally processed Tau. Increased levels of iAβ and the formation of NFTs are seen very early on in a population of neurons belonging to EC layer II (EC LII), and recent evidence leads us to believe that this population is made up of highly energy-demanding reelin-positive (RE+) projection neurons. Mitochondria are fundamental to the energy supply, metabolism, and plasticity of neurons. Evidence from AD postmortem brain tissues supports the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the initial pathological events in AD, and this is likely to take place in the vulnerable RE + EC LII neurons. Here we review and discuss these notions, anchored to the anatomy of AD, and formulate a hypothesis attempting to explain the vulnerability of RE + EC LII neurons to the formation of NFTs. We attempt to link impaired mitochondrial clearance to iAβ and signaling involving both apolipoprotein 4 and reelin, and argue for their relevance to the formation of NFTs specifically in RE + EC LII neurons during the prodromal stages of AD. We believe future studies on these interactions holds promise to advance our understanding of AD etiology and provide new ideas for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Systems medicine is founded on a mechanism-based approach and identifies in this way specific therapeutic targets. This approach has been applied for the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 plays a central role in different pathologies including neurodegenerative disorders (NDs), which are characterized by common pathogenetic features. We here present wide scientific background indicating how a natural bioactive molecule with antioxidant/anti-apoptotic and pro-autophagy properties such as the ozone (O3) can represent a potential new strategy to delay neurodegeneration. Our hypothesis is based on different evidence demonstrating the interaction between O3 and Nrf2 system. Through a meta-analytic approach, we found a significant modulation of O3 on endogenous antioxidant-Nrf2 (p < 0.00001, Odd Ratio (OR) = 1.71 95%CI:1.17-2.25) and vitagene-Nrf2 systems (p < 0.00001, OR = 1.80 95%CI:1.05-2.55). O3 activates also immune, anti-inflammatory signalling, proteasome, releases growth factors, improves blood circulation, and has antimicrobial activity, with potential effects on gut microbiota. Thus, we provide a consistent rationale to implement future clinical studies to apply the oxygen-ozone (O2-O3) therapy in an early phase of aging decline, when it is still possible to intervene before to potentially develop a more severe neurodegenerative pathology. We suggest that O3 along with other antioxidants (polyphenols, mushrooms) implicated in the same Nrf2-mechanisms, can show neurogenic potential, providing evidence as new preventive strategies in aging and in NDs.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pathomechanisms of sedentary behaviour (SB) are unclear. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the associations between SB and various biomarkers in older adults. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED) up to July 2015 to identify studies with objective or subjective measures of SB, sample size ≥50, mean age ≥60years and accelerometer wear time ≥3days. Methodological quality was appraised with the CASP tool. The protocol was pre-specified (PROSPERO CRD42015023731). RESULTS: 12701 abstracts were retrieved, 275 full text articles further explored, from which 249 were excluded. In the final sample (26 articles) a total of 63 biomarkers were detected. Most investigated markers were: body mass index (BMI, n=15), waist circumference (WC, n=15), blood pressure (n=11), triglycerides (n=12) and high density lipoprotein (HDL, n=15). Some inflammation markers were identified such as interleukin-6, C-reactive protein or tumor necrosis factor alpha. There was a lack of renal, muscle or bone biomarkers. Randomized controlled trials found a positive correlation for SB with BMI, neck circumference, fat mass, HbA1C, cholesterol and insulin levels, cohort studies additionally for WC, leptin, C-peptide, ApoA1 and Low density lipoprotein and a negative correlation for HDL. CONCLUSION: Most studied biomarkers associated with SB were of cardiovascular or metabolic origin. There is a suggestion of a negative impact of SB on biomarkers but still a paucity of high quality investigations exist. Longitudinal studies with objectively measured SB are needed to further elucidate the pathophysiological pathways and possible associations of unexplored biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the social hallmarks of aging including low lifetime socioeconomic status, adversity in childhood and adulthood, being a member of a minority group, adverse health behaviors, and adverse psychological states. The \"Social Hallmarks of Aging\" are analogous to the \"Geroscience Hallmarks of Aging\" in reflecting a set of underlying and interrelated social causes of multiple age-related health outcomes. The paper presents empirical work incorporating the social hallmarks of aging with indicators of multiple biological hallmarks of aging as well as downstream biology in explaining a range of health outcomes. Results show the relative strength of the associations of social and biological measures with important health outcomes. Social factors are strongly related to physical and cognitive functioning and multimorbidity in this older population; this remains true when the significant number of biological measures are controlled. These results can be interpreted to mean that a significant amount of the social variance in age-related health outcomes is not explained by these measures of biology. Indicators of the geroscience hallmarks of aging only relate modestly to the variability in human health outcomes. Attention to the social hallmarks related to human aging can usefully be incorporated into work on the biological hallmarks of aging to make greater progress in understanding human aging.",

Based on preliminary data from Sweden and other reports, in this paper we propose a conceptual framework whereby different factors related to biological and social vulnerability may explain the specific COVID-19 burden among older people. There is already some evidence showing large social disparities in the prevention, treatment, prognosis and/or long-term consequences of COVID-19. The remaining question is to what extent these affect older adults specifically. We provide the rationale to address this question with scientific methods and proper study designs, where the interplay between individuals' biomedical status and their social environment is the focus. Only through interdisciplinary research integrating biological, clinical and social data will we be able to provide new insights into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and inform actions aimed at reducing older adults' vulnerability to COVID-19 or other similar pandemics in the future.",

    "abstract": "In the United Kingdom (UK), it is projected that by 2035 people aged >65 years will make up 23 % of the population, with those aged >85 years accounting for 5% of the total population. Ageing is associated with progressive changes in muscle metabolism and a decline in functional capacity, leading to a loss of independence. Muscle metabolic changes associated with ageing have been linked to alterations in muscle architecture and declines in muscle mass and insulin sensitivity. However, the biological features often attributed to muscle ageing are also seen in controlled studies of physical inactivity (e.g. reduced step-count and bed-rest), and it is currently unclear how many of these ageing features are due to ageing per se or sedentarism. This is particularly relevant at a time of home confinements reducing physical activity levels during the Covid-19 pandemic. Current knowledge gaps include the relative contribution that physical inactivity plays in the development of many of the negative features associated with muscle decline in older age. Similarly, data demonstrating positive effects of government recommended physical activity guidelines on muscle health are largely non-existent. It is imperative therefore that research examining interactions between ageing, physical activity and muscle mass and metabolic health is prioritised so that it can inform on the \"normal\" muscle ageing process and on strategies for improving health span and well-being. This review will focus on important changes in muscle architecture and metabolism that accompany ageing and highlight the likely contribution of physical inactivity to these changes.",

    "abstract": "The global increases in life expectancy and population have resulted in a growing ageing population and with it a growing number of people living with age-related neurodegenerative conditions and dementia, shifting focus towards methods of prevention, with lifestyle approaches such as nutrition representing a promising avenue for further development. This overview summarises the main themes discussed during the 3rd Symposium on \"Nutrition for the Ageing Brain: Moving Towards Clinical Applications\" held in Madrid in August 2018, enlarged with the current state of knowledge on how nutrition influences healthy ageing and gives recommendations regarding how the critical field of nutrition and neurodegeneration research should move forward into the future. Specific nutrients are discussed as well as the impact of multi-nutrient and whole diet approaches, showing particular promise to combatting the growing burden of age-related cognitive decline. The emergence of new avenues for exploring the role of diet in healthy ageing, such as the impact of the gut microbiome and development of new techniques (imaging measures of brain metabolism, metabolomics, biomarkers) are enabling researchers to approach finding answers to these questions. But the translation of these findings into clinical and public health contexts remains an obstacle due to significant shortcomings in nutrition research or pressure on the scientific community to communicate recommendations to the general public in a convincing and accessible way. Some promising programs exist but further investigation to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which nutrition can improve brain health across the human lifespan is still required.",

There is an emerging number of small human trials that can take advantage of new models integrating behavioral and social factors. Understanding dynamic aging mechanisms, given the powerful social determinants of aging (Crimmins, 2020) and human variability and environmental contexts (Moffitt, 2020), will be critical. Behavioral and social factors are intrinsic to aging. Toxic stressors broadly defined can lead to stress-acceleration of aging, either directly impacting aging processes or by shaping poor behavioral health, and underlie the socioeconomic disparities of aging. In contrast, hormetic stressors, acute intermittent stressors of moderate intensity, can produce stress resilience, the ability for quick recovery and possibly rejuvenation of cells and tissues. Although health research usually examines static biomarkers, aging is reflected in dynamic ability to recover from challenges pointing to new interventions and targets for examining mechanisms. A fuller model incorporating stress resilience provides innovative biobehavioral interventions, both for bolstering response to challenges, such as COVID-19, and for improving healthspan.",

This systematic review evaluated the impacts of intergenerational engagement on cognitive, social, and health outcomes in healthy older adults and older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Comprehensive literature searches were undertaken, with records filtered according to pre-registered criteria. Study quality was formally assessed, and a narrative synthesis of the findings produced. Forty-four studies were reviewed. Regarding quantitative evidence, 4 out of 8 studies found significant intergenerational engagement effects on cognitive outcomes, 15 of 24 on social outcomes, and 21 of 31 on health-related outcomes. Qualitative evidence was also important for understanding perceived impacts and experiences of intergenerational programmes. Only 11 studies fully met criteria for high quality research, of which the majority focused on social outcomes. There are a range of potential benefits of intergenerational engagement, most notably regarding anxiety, generativity, cross-age attitudes, and physical activity. However, heterogeneity in programme context, sample design, dosage, and duration indicate that more research is required to enable wider implementation and generalisability. Scientific rigour in both quantitative and qualitative research should also be employed as far as possible, to provide the highest quality evidence.",

    "abstract": "In the past two decades, advances in sequencing technology and analysis of the human and mouse genome have led to the discovery of many non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including: microRNA, small-interfering RNAs, piwi-associated small RNAs, transfer RNA-derived small RNAs, long-non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs. Compared with healthy controls, levels of some ncRNAs are significantly altered in the central nervous system and blood of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the mechanisms are still not fully elucidated, studies have revealed that these highly conserved ncRNAs are important modulators of gene expression, amyloid-β production, tau phosphorylation, inflammation, synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, all features considered central to AD pathogenesis. Despite considerable difficulties due to their large heterogeneity, and the complexity of their regulatory pathways, research in this rapidly growing field suggests that ncRNAs hold great potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets against AD. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the neurobiology of ncRNA in the context of AD pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Skin is the largest organ of the body with important protective functions, which become compromised with time due to both intrinsic and extrinsic ageing processes. Cellular senescence is the primary ageing process at cell level, associated with loss of proliferative capacity, mitochondrial dysfunction and significantly altered patterns of expression and secretion of bioactive molecules. Intervention experiments have proven cell senescence as a relevant cause of ageing in many organs. In case of skin, accumulation of senescence in all major compartments with ageing is well documented and might be responsible for most, if not all, the molecular changes observed during ageing. Incorporation of senescent cells into in-vitro skin models (specifically 3D full thickness models) recapitulates changes typically associated with skin ageing. However, crucial evidence is still missing. A beneficial effect of senescent cell ablation on skin ageing has so far only been shown following rather unspecific interventions or in transgenic mouse models. We conclude that evidence for cellular senescence as a relevant cause of intrinsic skin ageing is highly suggestive but not yet completely conclusive.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While handgrip strength is associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality, whether such associations are dose-dependent is largely unknown. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review on the dose-response relationship of handgrip strength with all-cause mortality, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality. METHODS: The data source included three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus) from inception to 8 February 2022. Prospective cohort studies of healthy adults with objective measures of handgrip strength were included. Two researchers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used estimates regarding handgrip strength categories to conduct a random forest model, and a two-stage random-effects hierarchical meta-regression model pooling study-specific estimates for dose-response relationship. Outcomes included all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies comprising 3,135,473 participants (49.6% women, age range 35-85 years) were included. Random forest models showed a significant inverse association between handgrip strength and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Dose-response meta-analyses showed that higher levels of handgrip strength significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality within 26 to 50 kilograms (Higgin´s I2=45.7%) in a close-to-linear inverse fashion. Cancer and cardiovascular mortality displayed a trend towards a U-shaped association with a significant risk reduction between 16 and 33 kilograms (Higgin´s I2=77.4%), and a close-to-linear inverse shaped and significant risk reduction ranging from 24 to 40 kilograms (Higgin´s I2=79.7%) respectively. CONCLUSION: There is strong evidence for an association between lower handgrip strength with higher all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality risk. The dose-response relationship of handgrip strength substantially varies depending on the cause of mortality.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a well-known neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of two main hallmarks – Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ deposits. Notwithstanding, in the last few years the scientific evidence about the drivers of AD have been changing and nowadays age-related vascular alterations and several cardiovascular risk factors have been shown to trigger the development of AD. In this context, drugs targeting the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS), commonly used for the treatment of hypertension, are evidencing a high potential to delay AD development due to their action on brain RAS. Indeed, the ACE 1/Ang II/AT1R axis is believed to be upregulated in AD and to be responsible for deleterious effects such as increased oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability, astrocytes dysfunction and a decrease in cerebral blood flow. In contrast, the alternative axis – ACE 1/Ang II/AT2R; ACE 2/Ang (1−7)/MasR; Ang IV/ AT4R(IRAP) – seems to counterbalance the deleterious effects of the principal axis and to exert beneficial effects on memory and cognition. Accordingly, retrospective studies demonstrate a reduced risk of developing AD among people taking RAS medication as well as several in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical studies as it is herein critically reviewed. In this review, we first revise, at a glance, the pathophysiology of AD focused on its classic hallmarks. Secondly, an overview about the impact of the RAS on the pathophysiology of AD is also provided, focused on their four essential axes ACE 1/Ang II/AT2R; ACE 2/Ang (1−7)/MasR; Ang IV/ AT4R(IRAP) and ACE 1/Ang II/AT1R. Finally, the therapeutic potential of available drugs targeting RAS on AD, namely angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), is highlighted and data supporting this hope will be presented, from in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical to clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia and myopathies cause progressive muscle weakness and degeneration, which are closely associated with fat infiltration and fibrosis in muscle. Recently, experimental research has shed light on fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), also known as muscle-resident mesenchymal progenitors with multiple differentiation potential for adipogenesis, fibrosis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. They are considered key regulators of muscle homeostasis and integrity. They play supportive roles in muscle development and repair by orchestrating the regulatory interplay between muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and immune cells. Interestingly, FAPs also contribute to intramuscular fat infiltration, fibrosis and other pathologies when the functional integrity of the network is compromised. In this review, we summarize recent insights into the roles of FAPs in maintenance of skeletal muscle homeostasis, and discuss the underlying mechanisms regulating FAPs behavior and fate, highlighting their roles in participating in efficient muscle repair and fat infiltrated muscle degeneration as well as during muscle atrophy. We suggest that controlling and predicting FAPs differentiation may become a promising strategy to improve muscle function and prevent irreparable muscle damage.",

Thus, we sought to systematically analyse the prevalence of dementia and explore possible drivers that lead to this disparity in LAC countries.We searched Pubmed, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Lilacs, and SciELO for studies on dementia in LAC countries published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Random-effects model was applied.Thirty-one studies from 17 LAC countries were included. Pooled prevalence of all-cause dementia was 10.66%. Further analyses with studies providing raw prevalence by sex, area, and educational level showed a higher prevalence for women (8.97%) than for men (7.26%). Also, dementia prevalence was higher for rural than urban residents (7.71% vs 8.68%, respectively). Participants without formal education presented more than double the prevalence of dementia (21.37%) compared to those with at least one year of formal education (9.88%). Studies with more recent data collection showed higher dementia prevalence.Our findings suggest a high global dementia prevalence in LAC countries and an unequal burden of dementia for women, lower-educated, and rural residents. Secular increases in dementia prevalence call for greater public health efforts for preventative actions.",

    "abstract": "Chronic (neuro)inflammation plays an important role in many age-related central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and vascular dementia. Inflammation also characterizes many conditions that form a risk factor for these CNS disorders, such as physical inactivity, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an inflammatory protein shown to be involved in different age-related CNS diseases, as well as risk factor conditions thereof. Lcn2 expression is increased in the periphery and the brain in different age-related CNS diseases and also their risk factor conditions. Experimental studies indicate that Lcn2 contributes to various neuropathophysiological processes of age-related CNS diseases, including exacerbated neuroinflammation, cell death and iron dysregulation, which may negatively impact cognitive function. We hypothesize that increased Lcn2 levels as a result of age-related risk factor conditions may sensitize the brain and increase the risk to develop age-related CNS diseases. In this review we first provide a comprehensive overview of the known functions of Lcn2, and its effects in the CNS. Subsequently, this review explores Lcn2 as a potential (neuro)inflammatory link between different risk factor conditions and the development of age-related CNS disorders. Altogether, evidence convincingly indicates Lcn2 as a key constituent in ageing and age-related brain diseases.",

Design: Systematic review and robust variance estimation meta-analysis with meta-regression. Data sources: Systematic search of MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases. Results: Fifty studies with 60 intervention arms and 2283 in-analyses participants were included. Due to the low number of studies, the three patient groups were combined and analyzed as a single group. Overall, low- (g=0.19, p = 0.024) and high-intensity exercise (g=0.40, p = 0.001) improved neuroplasticity. Exercise intensity scaled with neuroplasticity only in healthy young adults but not in healthy older adults or patient groups. Exercise-induced improvements in neuroplasticity were associated with changes in motor but not cognitive outcomes. Conclusion: Exercise intensity is an important variable to dose and individualize the exercise stimulus for healthy young individuals but not necessarily for healthy older adults and neurological patients. This conclusion warrants caution because studies are needed that directly compare the effects of low- vs. high-intensity exercise on neuroplasticity to determine if such changes are mechanistically and incrementally linked to improved cognition and motor function.",

    "abstract": "Untangling the interdependency of infections, immunity and frailty may help to clarify their roles in the maintenance of health in aging individuals, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted such priority. In this scoping review we aimed to systematically collect the evidence on 1) the impact of common infections such as influenza, pneumonia and varicella zoster on frailty development, and 2) the role played by frailty in the response to immunization of older adults. Findings are discussed under a unifying framework to identify knowledge gaps and outline their clinical and public health implications to foster a healthier aging. Twenty-nine studies (113,863 participants) selected to answer the first question provided a moderately strong evidence of an association between infections and physical as well as cognitive decline – two essential dimensions of frailty. Thirteen studies (34,520 participants) investigating the second aim, showed that frailty was associated with an impaired immune response in older ages, likely due to immunosenescence. However, the paucity of studies, the absence of tools to predict vaccine efficacy, and the lack of studies investigating the efficacy of newer vaccines in presence of frailty, strongly limit the formulation of more personalized immunization strategies for older adults. The current evidence suggests that infections and frailty repeatedly cross each other pathophysiological paths and accelerate the aging process in a vicious circle. Such evidence opens to several considerations. First, the prevention of both conditions pass through a life course approach, which includes several individual and societal aspects. Second, the maintenance of a well-functioning immune system may be accomplished by preventing frailty, and vice versa. Third, increasing the adherence to immunization may delay the onset of frailty and maintain the immune system homeostasis, beyond preventing infections.",

    "abstract": "The primordial small gaseous molecules, such as: NO, CO, H2S and formaldehyde (FA) are present in the brains. Whether FA as well as the other molecules participates in brain functions is unclear. Recently, its pathophysiological functions have been investigated. Notably, under physiological conditions, learning activity induces a transient generation of hippocampal FA, which promotes memory formation by enhancing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-currents. However, ageing leads to FA accumulation in brain for the dysregulation of FA metabolism; and excessive FA directly impairs memory by inhibiting NMDA-receptor. Especially, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Aβ) accelerates FA accumulation by inactivating alcohol dehydrogenase-5; in turn, FA promotes Aβ oligomerization, fibrillation and tau hyperphosphorylation. Hence, there is a vicious circle encompassing Aβ assembly and FA generation. Even worse, FA induces Aβ deposition in the extracellular space (ECS), which blocks the medicines (dissolved in the interstitial fluid) flowing into the damaged neurons in the deep cortex. However, phototherapy destroys Aβ deposits in the ECS and restores ISF flow. Coenzyme Q10, which scavenges FA, was shown to ameliorate Aβ-induced AD pathological phenotypes, thus suggesting a causative relation between FA toxicity and AD. These findings suggest that the combination of these two methods is a promising strategy for treating AD.",

We systematically reviewed the characteristics, methodology and outcomes of 27 studies of HRV in relation to measures of cognition and behavior in neurodegenerative conditions, and assessed the strength of this relationship, cross-sectionally, across 18 studies. A significant, moderate effect was observed (r = 0.25), such that higher HRV was related to better cognitive and behavioral scores, which was not influenced by mean age or cognitive status. There was no evidence of small-study effects but we could not rule out publication bias, and other factors may have contributed to heterogeneity between studies. Our findings support the proposal that HRV may be a marker of self-regulatory processes in neurodegenerative conditions, and further research on this association is needed in relation to neuropsychiatric symptoms and alongside neuroimaging methods.",

Insights from these studies were consequently used to develop interventions, which are predominantly aimed at rectifying nutritional deficiencies, as opposed to interventions that may enable older adults to eat well and enjoy their food-related life well into older age. The objective of the present review is to summarise the existing knowledge base on psychosocial influences on eating behaviours in later life. Following comprehensive searches, review, and appraisal, 53 articles were included (22 qualitative and 31 quantitative) to provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the psychosocial factors influencing eating behaviours. Our analysis identified eight underpinning psychosocial factors that influences eating behaviours in later life; (1) health awareness & attitudes, (2) food decision making, (3) perceived dietary control, (4) mental health & mood, (5) food emotions & enjoyment, (6) eating arrangements, (7) social facilitation, and (8) social support. The importance and lasting influence of early food experiences were also identified as contributing to eating behaviours in later life. The review concludes with the call for further investigation into specific psychosocial factors that influence eating behaviour, calls for improvements in methodologies, and a summary of psychosocial barriers and enablers to eating well in later life.",

Peripheral immune cell infiltration and activation of microglia and astrocytes are observed in PD, a process called neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is a fundamental response to protect the brain but, when chronic, it triggers neuronal damage. In the last decade, central and peripheral inflammation were suggested to occur at the prodromal stage of PD, sustained throughout disease progression, and may play a significant role in the pathology. Understanding the pathological mechanisms of PD has been a high priority in research, primarily to find effective treatments once symptoms are present. Evidence indicates that early life exposure to neuroinflammation as a consequence of life events, environmental or behaviour factors such as exposure to infections, pollution or a high fat diet increase the risk of developing PD. Many studies show healthy habits and products that decrease neuroinflammation also reduce the risk of PD. Here, we aim to stimulate discussion about the role of neuroinflammation in PD onset and progression. We highlight that reducing neuroinflammation throughout the lifespan is critical for preventing idiopathic PD, and present epidemiological studies that detail risk and protective factors. It is possible that introducing lifestyle changes that reduce neuroinflammation at the time of PD diagnosis may slow symptom progression. Finally, we discuss compounds and therapeutics to treat the neuroinflammation associated with PD.",

The purpose of this review was to systematically search and analyse the prevalence of frailty among geriatric hospital inpatients within the literature and examine its associations with national economic indicators.Systematic searches were conducted on Ovid, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, and the Cochrane Library, encompassing all literature published prior to 22 November 2018, supplemented with manual reference searches. Included studies utilised a validated operational definition of frailty, reported the prevalence of frailty, had a minimum age ≥ 65 years, attempted to assess the whole ward/clinical population, and occurred among hospital inpatients. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality.Ninety-six studies with a pooled sample of 467,779 geriatric hospital inpatients were included. The median critical appraisal score was 8/9 (range 7-9). The pooled prevalence of frailty, and pre-frailty, among geriatric hospital inpatients was 47.4% (95% CI 43.7-51.1%), and 25.8% (95% CI 22.0-29.6%), respectively. Significant differences were observed in the prevalence of frailty stratified by age, prevalent morbidity, ward type, clinical population, and operational definition. No significant differences were observed in stratified analyses by sex or continent, or significant associations between the prevalence of frailty and economic indicators.Frailty is highly prevalent among geriatric hospital inpatients. High heterogeneity exists within this setting based on various clinical and demographic characteristics. Pooled estimates reported in this review place the prevalence of frailty among geriatric hospital inpatients between that reported for community-dwelling older adults and older adults in nursing homes, outlining an increase in the relative prevalence of frailty with progression through the healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and there is currently no cure. Novel approaches to treat AD and curb the rapidly increasing worldwide prevalence and costs of dementia are needed. Physical inactivity is a significant modifiable risk factor for AD, estimated to contribute to 12.7% of AD cases worldwide. Exercise interventions in humans and animals have shown beneficial effects of exercise on brain plasticity and cognitive functions. In animal studies, exercise also improved AD pathology. The mechanisms underlying these effects of exercise seem to be associated mainly with exercise performance or cardiorespiratory fitness. In addition, exercise-induced molecules of peripheral origin seem to play an important role. Since exercise affects the whole body, there likely is no single therapeutic target that could mimic all the benefits of exercise. However, systemic strategies may be a viable means to convey broad therapeutic effects in AD patients. Here, we review the potential of physical activity and exercise training in AD prevention and treatment, shining light on recently discovered underlying mechanisms and concluding with a view on future development of exercise-free treatment strategies for AD.",

The collection of saliva offers several advantages, being noninvasive, stress-free, and repeatable. Moreover, the detection of biomarkers directly in saliva could allow an early diagnosis of the disease, leading to timely treatments. The aim of this manuscript is to highlight the most relevant researchers' findings relatively to salivary biomarkers of neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases, and to describe innovative and advanced biosensing strategies for the detection of salivary biomarkers. This review is focused on five relevant aging-related neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Multiple Sclerosis) and the salivary biomarkers most commonly associated with them. Advanced biosensors enabling molecular diagnostics for the detection of salivary biomarkers are presented, in order to stimulate future research in this direction and pave the way for their clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex eye disease with the retina as the target tissue and aging as per definition the most serious risk factor. However, the retina contains over 60 kinds of cells that form different structures, including the neuroretina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) which can age at different rates. Other established or putative AMD risk factors can differentially affect the neuroretina and RPE and can differently interplay with aging of these structures. The occurrence of β-amyloid plaques and increased levels of cholesterol in AMD retinas suggest that AMD may be a syndrome of accelerated brain aging. Therefore, the question about the real meaning of age in AMD is justified. In this review we present and update information on how aging may interplay with some aspects of AMD pathogenesis, such as oxidative stress, amyloid beta formation, circadian rhythm, metabolic aging and cellular senescence. Also, we show how this interplay can be specific for photoreceptors, microglia cells and RPE cells as well as in Bruch's membrane and the choroid. Therefore, the process of aging may differentially affect different retinal structures. As an accurate quantiﬁcation of biological aging is important for risk stratiﬁcation and early intervention for age-related diseases, the determination how photoreceptors, microglial and RPE cells age in AMD may be helpful for a precise diagnosis and treatment of this largely untreatable disease.",

Herein conforming to PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using data from 27 observational studies in non-demented individuals. We used effect size and p-value based meta-analysis methods considering marked heterogeneity among studies. We found that the longer LTL was associated with higher brain volume (β = 0.43, 95%CI: 0.36-0.50%, p = 0.008, N = 1102) and with higher global cognition (β = 0.01; 95%CI: 0.00-0.02, p = 0.03, N = 19609) by effect size based meta-analysis and with brain volume, hippocampal volume, global cognition, cognitive domains of attention/speed as well as executive functions by p-value based meta-analysis. No significant association of LTL with brain white matter hyperintensities was detected. Furthermore, the evidence strongly suggests a subgroup-specific canonical effect of telomeres, notably in older individuals and females. In conclusion, we provide meta-analytic evidence on the beneficial effect of telomeres on brain structure as well as cognition and advocate for a beneficial subgroup-specific effect that warrants further attention.",

    "abstract": "Life expectancy has increased substantially over the last 150 years. Yet this means that now most people also spend a greater length of time suffering from various age-associated diseases. As such, delaying age-related functional decline and extending healthspan, the period of active older years free from disease and disability, is an overarching objective of current aging research. Geroprotectors, compounds that target pathways that causally influence aging, are increasingly recognized as a means to extend healthspan in the aging population. Meanwhile, FOXO3 has emerged as a geroprotective gene intricately involved in aging and healthspan. FOXO3 genetic variants are linked to human longevity, reduced disease risks, and even self-reported health. Therefore, identification of FOXO3-activating compounds represents one of the most direct candidate approaches to extending healthspan in aging humans. In this work, we review compounds that activate FOXO3, or influence healthspan or lifespan in a FOXO3-dependent manner. These compounds can be classified as pharmaceuticals, including PI3K/AKT inhibitors and AMPK activators, antidepressants and antipsychotics, muscle relaxants, and HDAC inhibitors, or as nutraceuticals, including primary metabolites involved in cell growth and sustenance, and secondary metabolites including extracts, polyphenols, terpenoids, and other purified natural compounds. The compounds documented here provide a basis and resource for further research and development, with the ultimate goal of promoting healthy longevity in humans.",

    "abstract": "Spaceflight and its associated stressors, such as microgravity, radiation exposure, confinement, circadian derailment and disruptive workloads represent an unprecedented type of exposome that is entirely novel from an evolutionary stand point. Within this perspective, we aimed to review the effects of prolonged spaceflight on immune-neuroendocrine systems, brain and brain-gut axis, cardiovascular system and musculoskeletal apparatus, highlighting in particular the similarities with an accelerated aging process. In particular, spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy/sarcopenia and bone loss, vascular and metabolic changes, hyper and hypo reaction of innate and adaptive immune system appear to be modifications shared with the aging process. Most of these modifications are mediated by molecular events that include oxidative and mitochondrial stress, autophagy, DNA damage repair and telomere length alteration, among others, which directly or indirectly converge on the activation of an inflammatory response. According to the inflammaging theory of aging, such an inflammatory response could be a driver of an acceleration of the normal, physiological rate of aging and it is likely that all the systemic modifications in turn lead to an increase of inflammaging in a sort of vicious cycle. The most updated countermeasures to fight these modifications will be also discussed in the light of their possible application not only for astronauts' benefit, but also for older adults on the ground.",

    "abstract": "Frailty is a risk factor for adverse health outcomes. There is a paucity of literature on frailty progression defined by a cumulative deficit model among community dwelling older people. The objective of this review was to synthesise evidence on these changes in health and mortality among community-dwelling older people.Six databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycInfo, Web of Science) and a clinical trials registry were searched in July 2021. The inclusion criteria were studies using a frailty index and providing information on transition between frailty states or to death in community-dwelling older people aged ≥ 50. Exclusion criteria were studies examining specific health conditions, conference abstracts and non-English studies. To standardise the follow-up period and facilitate comparison, we converted the transition probabilities to annual transition rates.Two reviewers independently screened 5078 studies and 61 studies were included for analysis. Of these, only three used the same frailty state cut-points to facilitate cross-cohort comparison. This review found that frailty tends to increase with time, people who are frail at baseline have greater likelihood to progress in frailty and die, and the main factor that accelerates frailty progression is age. Other risk factors for progression are having chronic disease, smoking, obesity, low-income or/and low-education levels. A frailty index is an accurate predictor of adverse outcomes and death.This systematic review demonstrated that worsening in frailty was a common frailty transition, and older people who are frail at baseline are more likely to die. A frailty index has significant power to predict adverse health outcomes. It is a useful tool for within-cohort comparison but there are challenges comparing different cohorts due to dependence of frailty progression on age and differences in how frailty index is defined and measured.",

    "abstract": "Uterine aging is an important factor that impacts fertility, reproductive health, and uterus-related diseases; however, it remains poorly explored. Functionally, these disturbances have been associated with an abnormal hormonal response in the endometrium and decreased endometrial receptivity. Based on emerging evidence, these alterations are mediated via the senescence of endometrial stem cells and impaired decidualization of endometrial stromal cells. Multiple molecular activities may participate in uterine aging, including oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, DNA damage response, and cellular senescence. Over the past decade, several protective strategies targeting these biological processes have afforded promising results, including stem cell therapy, anti-aging drugs, and herbal medicines. However, the currently available evidence is fragmented and scattered. Here, we summarize the most recent findings regarding uterine aging, including functional and structural alterations and potential cellular and molecular mechanisms, and discuss potential protective interventions against uterine aging. Thereby, we hope to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological processes and underlying mechanisms associated with uterine aging, as well as improve fecundity and reproductive outcomes in females of advanced reproductive age.",

Among them, the contact between endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the main intracellular calcium storage organelles, and mitochondria has been recognized for decades, and its main roles in the ion and lipid transport, ROS signaling, membrane dynamic changes and cellular metabolism are basically determined. At present, many tumor chemotherapeutic drugs rely on ER-mitochondrial calcium signal to function, but the mechanism of targeting resident molecules at the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) to sensitize traditional chemotherapy and the new tumor therapeutic targets identified based on the signal pathways on the MAM have not been thoroughly discussed. In this review, we highlight the key roles of various signaling pathways at the ER-mitochondria contact site in tumorigenesis and focus on novel anticancer therapy strategies targeting potential targets at this contact site.",

    "abstract": "Protein misfolding is prominent in early cellular pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), implicating pathophysiological significance of endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response (ER stress/UPR) and highlighting it as a target for drug development. Experimental data from animal AD models and observations on human specimens are, however, inconsistent. ER stress and associated UPR are readily observed in in vitro AD cellular models and in some AD model animals. In the human brain, components and markers of ER stress as well as UPR transducers are observed at Braak stages III-VI associated with severe neuropathology and neuronal death. The picture, however, is further complicated by the brain region- and cell type-specificity of the AD-related pathology. Terms 'disturbed' or 'non-canonical' ER stress/UPR were used to describe the discrepancies between experimental data and the classic ER stress/UPR cascade. Here we discuss possible 'disturbing' or 'interfering' factors which may modify ER stress/UPR in the early AD pathogenesis. We focus on the dysregulation of the ER Ca2+ homeostasis, store-operated Ca2+ entry, and the interaction between the ER and mitochondria. We suggest that a detailed study of the CNS cell type-specific alterations of Ca2+ homeostasis in early AD may deepen our understanding of AD-related dysproteostasis.",

    "abstract": "Sensitive and specific antemortem biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease and dementia are crucial to the pursuit of effective treatments, required both to reliably identify disease and to track its progression. Atrophy is the structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hallmark of neurodegeneration. However in most cases it likely indicates a relatively advanced stage of disease less susceptible to treatment as some disease processes begin decades prior to clinical onset. Among emerging metrics that characterise brain shape rather than volume, fractal dimension (FD) quantifies shape complexity. FD has been applied in diverse fields of science to measure subtle changes in elaborate structures. We review its application thus far to structural MRI of the brain in neurodegenerative disease and dementia. We identified studies involving subjects who met criteria for mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, Frontotemporal Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Multiple Systems Atrophy, Spinocerebellar Ataxia and Multiple Sclerosis. The early literature suggests that neurodegenerative disease processes are usually associated with a decline in FD of the brain. The literature includes examples of disease-related change in FD occurring independently of atrophy, which if substantiated would represent a valuable advantage over other structural imaging metrics. However, it is likely to be non-specific and to exhibit complex spatial and temporal patterns. A more harmonious methodological approach across a larger number of studies as well as careful attention to technical factors associated with image processing and FD measurement will help to better elucidate the metric's utility.",

    "abstract": "According to the Geroscience concept that organismal aging and age-associated diseases share the same basic molecular mechanisms, the identification of biomarkers of age that can efficiently classify people as biologically older (or younger) than their chronological (i.e. calendar) age is becoming of paramount importance. These people will be in fact at higher (or lower) risk for many different age-associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, cancer, etc. In turn, patients suffering from these diseases are biologically older than healthy age-matched individuals. Many biomarkers that correlate with age have been described so far. The aim of the present review is to discuss the usefulness of some of these biomarkers (especially soluble, circulating ones) in order to identify frail patients, possibly before the appearance of clinical symptoms, as well as patients at risk for age-associated diseases. An overview of selected biomarkers will be discussed in this regard, in particular we will focus on biomarkers related to metabolic stress response, inflammation, and cell death (in particular in neurodegeneration), all phenomena connected to inflammaging (chronic, low-grade, age-associated inflammation). In the second part of the review, next-generation markers such as extracellular vesicles and their cargos, epigenetic markers and gut microbiota composition, will be discussed. Since recent progresses in omics techniques have allowed an exponential increase in the production of laboratory data also in the field of biomarkers of age, making it difficult to extract biological meaning from the huge mass of available data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches will be discussed as an increasingly important strategy for extracting knowledge from raw data and providing practitioners with actionable information to treat patients.",

    "abstract": "Physical inactivity (PI) is a major risk factor of chronic diseases. A major aspect of PI is loss of muscle mass and strength. The latter phenomenon significantly impacts daily life and represent a major issue for global health. Understandably, skeletal muscle itself has been the major focus of studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying loss of mass and strength. Relatively lesser attention has been given to the contribution of alterations in somatomotor control, despite the fact that these changes can start very early and can occur at multiple levels, from the cortex down to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). It is well known that exposure to chronic inactivity or immobilization causes a disproportionate loss of force compared to muscle mass, i.e. a loss of specific or intrinsic whole muscle force. The latter phenomenon may be partially explained by the loss of specific force of individual muscle fibres, but several other players are very likely to contribute to such detrimental phenomenon. Irrespective of the length of the disuse period, the loss of force is, in fact, more than two-fold greater than that of muscle size. It is very likely that somatomotor alterations may contribute to this loss in intrinsic muscle force. Here we review evidence that alterations of one component of somatomotor control, namely the neuromuscular junction, occur in disuse. We also discuss some of the novel players in NMJ stability (e.g., homer, bassoon, pannexin) and the importance of new established and emerging molecular markers of neurodegenerative processes in humans such as agrin, neural-cell adhesion molecule and light-chain neurofilaments.",

    "abstract": "While aging was traditionally viewed as a stochastic process of damage accumulation, it is now clear that aging is strongly influenced by genetics. The identification and characterization of long-lived genetic mutants in model organisms has provided insights into the genetic pathways and molecular mechanisms involved in extending longevity. Long-lived genetic mutants exhibit activation of multiple stress response pathways leading to enhanced resistance to exogenous stressors. As a result, lifespan exhibits a significant, positive correlation with resistance to stress. Disruption of stress response pathways inhibits lifespan extension in multiple long-lived mutants representing different pathways of lifespan extension and can also reduce the lifespan of wild-type animals. Combined, this suggests that activation of stress response pathways is a key mechanism by which long-lived mutants achieve their extended longevity and that many of these pathways are also required for normal lifespan. These results highlight an important role for stress response pathways in determining the lifespan of an organism.",

    "abstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a lifelong process encompassing a broad spectrum of cognitive disorders, ranging from subtle or mild deficits to prodromal and fully developed dementia, originating from cerebrovascular lesions such as large and small vessel disease. Genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to risk factors such as unhealthy lifestyles, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders will synergistically interact, yielding biochemical and structural brain changes, ultimately culminating in VCI. However, little is known about the pathological processes underlying VCI and the temporal dynamics between risk factors and disease mechanisms (biochemical and structural brain changes). This narrative review aims to provide an evidence-based summary of the link between individual vascular risk/disorders and cognitive dysfunction and the potential structural and biochemical pathophysiological processes. We also discuss some key challenges for future research on VCI. There is a need to shift from individual risk factors/disorders to comorbid vascular burden, identifying and integrating imaging and fluid biomarkers, implementing a life-course approach, considering possible neuroprotective influences of positive life exposures, and addressing biological sex at birth and gender differences. Finally, this review highlights the need for future researchers to leverage and integrate multidimensional data to advance our understanding of the mechanisms and pathophysiology of VCI.",

However, the exact mechanisms underlying these associations remain inadequately comprehended. This review systematically summarizes the current research on the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel and its implications for central nervous system mechanobiology, retrospects the results demonstrating the regulatory role of the mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel on various cell types within the central nervous system, including neural stem cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, astrocytes, and brain endothelial cells. Furthermore, the review discusses the current understanding of the involvement of the Piezo1 channel in central nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, stroke, and glioma.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of diabetes among the elderly population is significant and rising annually. One of the most severe and frequent complications of diabetes mellitus is the diabetic wound, which has long-term negative effects on patients' finances, mental health, and functional abilities. Exosomes, a cell-free therapy, have emerged as a promising novel treatment for diabetic wounds, but their mechanism is still not entirely understood. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of exosomes in the management of diabetic wounds.We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science for pertinent studies that described the therapeutic benefits of exosomes on diabetic wound models that were released before October 17, 2022. The outcome indicators consisted of wound healing rate, neovascular density, re-epithelialization rate, collagen deposition, scar width, and inflammatory factors. RevMan 5.4 software was used to conduct all statistical analyses.A total of 21 studies with 323 animals were identified in this meta-analysis. Pooled analyses demonstrated that exosome therapy was shown to be superior to control therapy in terms of wound healing rate (SMD = 5.42; 95 %CI = 4.40-6.44; P < 0.00001), neovascular density (SMD = 5.48; 95 %CI = 4.31-6.64; P < 0.00001), re-epithelialization rate (SMD = 5.06; 95 %CI = 3.75-6.37; P < 0.00001), collagen deposition (SMD = 4.78; 95 %CI = 3.58-5.98; P < 0.00001), scar width (SMD = -8.10; 95 %CI = -10.31 to -5.89; P < 0.00001). Additionally, the expression of inflammatory factors was significantly downregulated in the exosome treatment group.According to this meta-analysis of the current trials, exosome therapy can enhance the quality of diabetic wounds, especially when used in conjunction with novel dressings. To demonstrate the most efficient exosomes and therapeutic parameters for the treatment of diabetic wounds, future studies should conduct sizable, randomized, double-blind trials with high-quality, long-term follow-ups.",

    "abstract": "The restriction of calories, branched-chain amino acids, and methionine have all been shown to extend lifespan in model organisms. Recently, glycine was found to boost longevity in genetically heterogenous mice. This simple amino acid similarly extends lifespan in rats and improves health in mammalian models of age-related disease. While compelling data indicate that glycine is a pro-longevity molecule, divergent mechanisms may underlie its effects on aging. Glycine is abundant in collagen, a building block for glutathione, a precursor to creatine, and an acceptor for the enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT). A review of the literature strongly implicates GNMT, which clears methionine from the body by taking a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine and methylating glycine to form sarcosine. In flies, Gnmt is required for reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling and dietary restriction to fully extend lifespan. The geroprotector spermidine requires Gnmt to upregulate autophagy genes and boost longevity. Moreover, the overexpression of Gnmt is sufficient to extend lifespan and reduce methionine levels. Sarcosine, or methylglycine, declines with age in multiple species and is capable of inducing autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Taken all together, existing evidence suggests that glycine prolongs life by mimicking methionine restriction and activating autophagy.",

Coincidentally, popular lifestyle interventions, such as caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and regular exercise, in addition to pharmacological interventions intended to protect against age-related diseases, induce transcription factor EB (TFEB) and autophagy. In this review, we summarize emerging discoveries that point to TFEB activity affecting the hallmarks of aging, including inhibiting DNA damage and epigenetic modifications, inducing autophagy and cell clearance to promote proteostasis, regulating mitochondrial quality control, linking nutrient-sensing to energy metabolism, regulating pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, inhibiting senescence and promoting cell regenerative capacity. Furthermore, the therapeutic impact of TFEB activation on normal aging and tissue-specific disease development is assessed in the contexts of neurodegeneration and neuroplasticity, stem cell differentiation, immune responses, muscle energy adaptation, adipose tissue browning, hepatic functions, bone remodeling, and cancer. Safe and effective strategies of activating TFEB hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for multiple age-associated diseases and for extending lifespan.",

This neurological condition progressively hampers cognitive and memory functions, along with the ability to carry out fundamental tasks over time. From the symptoms it is very difficult to detect during its early stage. It has become necessary to develop a computer assisted diagnostic models for the early AD detection. This survey work, discussed about a review of 110 published AD detection methods and techniques from the year 2011 to till-date. This study lies in its comprehensive exploration of AD detection methods using a range of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and neuroimaging modalities. By collecting and analysing 50 papers related to AD diagnosis datasets, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the diversity of input types, subjects, and classes used in AD research. Summarizing 60 papers on methodologies gives researchers a succinct overview of various approaches that contribute to enhancing detection accuracy. From the review, data are acquired and pre-processed form multiple modalities of neuroimaging. This paper mainly focused on review of different datasets used, various feature extraction methods, parameters used in neuro images. To diagnosis the Alzheimer's disease, the existing methods utilized three most common artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning. We conclude this survey work by providing future perspectives for AD diagnosis at early stage.",

While some scores of neurocognitive tests improved upon treatment, real-world clinical benefits were minimal. This Viewpoint discusses additional, often overlooked findings from these trials. We also emphasize the multifactorial nature of AD and the need for a broader research perspective beyond the simplistic disease model provided by the ACH.",

    "abstract": "Aging is the greatest risk factor for chronic human diseases, including many eye diseases. Geroscience aims to understand the effects of the aging process on these diseases, including the genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of disease over the lifetime. Understanding of the aging eye increases general knowledge of the cellular physiology impacted by aging processes at various biological extremes. Two major diseases, age-related cataract and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are caused by dysfunction of the lens and retina, respectively. Lens transparency and light refraction are mediated by lens fiber cells lacking nuclei and other organelles, which provides a unique opportunity to study a single aging hallmark, i.e., loss of proteostasis, within an environment of limited metabolism. In AMD, local dysfunction of the photoreceptors/retinal pigmented epithelium/Bruch's membrane/choriocapillaris complex in the macula leads to the loss of photoreceptors and eventually loss of central vision, and is driven by nearly all the hallmarks of aging and shares features with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The aging eye can function as a model for studying basic mechanisms of aging and, vice versa, well-defined hallmarks of aging can be used as tools to understand age-related eye disease.",

Unfortunately, no particular medications exist to treat AD, as the current treatments only impede its progression.The link between AD and type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been increasingly revealed by research; the danger of developing both AD and T2D rises exponentially with age, with T2D being especially prone to AD. This has propelled researchers to investigate the mechanism(s) underlying this connection. A critical review of the relationship between insulin resistance, Aβ, oxidative stress, mitochondrial hypothesis, abnormal phosphorylation of Tau protein, inflammatory response, high blood glucose levels, neurotransmitters and signaling pathways, vascular issues in AD and diabetes, and the similarities between the two diseases, is presented in this review. Grasping the essential mechanisms behind this detrimental interaction may offer chances to devise successful therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria functionally degrade as neurons age. Degenerative changes cause inefficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and elevated electron leakage from the electron transport chain (ETC) promoting increased intramitochondrial generation of damaging reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and RNS). The associated progressive accumulation of molecular damage causes an increasingly rapid decline in mitochondrial physiology contributing to aging. Melatonin, a multifunctional free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant, is synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix of neurons. Melatonin reduces electron leakage from the ETC and elevates ATP production; it also detoxifies ROS/RNS and via the SIRT3/FOXO pathway it upregulates activities of superoxide dismutase 2 and glutathione peroxidase. Melatonin also influences glucose processing by neurons. In neurogenerative diseases, neurons often adopt Warburg-type metabolism which excludes pyruvate from the mitochondria causing reduced intramitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A production. Acetyl coenzyme A supports the citric acid cycle and OXPHOS. Additionally, acetyl coenzyme A is a required co-substrate for arylalkylamine-N-acetyl transferase, which rate limits melatonin synthesis; therefore, melatonin production is diminished in cells that experience Warburg-type metabolism making mitochondria more vulnerable to oxidative stress. Moreover, endogenously produced melatonin diminishes during aging, further increasing oxidative damage to mitochondrial components. More normal mitochondrial physiology is preserved in aging neurons with melatonin supplementation.",

These lead to chronic cerebrovascular dysfunction and carry a substantial risk of subsequent stroke and vascular cognitive impairment in aging populations. Owing to advances in neuroimaging, in vivo visualization of cerebral vasculature abnormities and detection of CSVD, including lacunes, microinfarcts, microbleeds and white matter lesions, is now possible, but remains a resource-, skills- and time-intensive approach. As a result, there has been a recent proliferation of blood-based biomarker studies for CSVD aimed at developing accessible screening tools for early detection and risk stratification. However, a good understanding of the pathophysiological processes underpinning CSVD is needed to identify and assess clinically useful biomarkers. Here, we provide an overview of processes associated with CSVD pathogenesis, including endothelial injury and dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, perivascular neuronal damage as well as cardiovascular dysfunction. Then, we review clinical studies of the key biomolecules involved in the aforementioned processes. Lastly, we outline future trends and directions for CSVD biomarker discovery and clinical validation.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a complex multidimensional, progressive remodeling process affecting multiple organ systems. While many studies have focused on studying aging across multiple organs, assessment of the contribution of individual organs to overall aging processes is a cutting-edge issue. An organ's biological age might influence the aging of other organs, revealing a multiorgan aging network. Recent data demonstrated a similar yet asynchronous inter-organs and inter-individuals progression of aging, thereby providing a foundation to track sources of declining health in old age. The integration of multiple omics with common clinical parameters through artificial intelligence has allowed the building of organ-specific aging clocks, which can predict the development of specific age-related diseases at high resolution. The peculiar individual aging-trajectory, referred to as ageotype, might provide a novel tool for a personalized anti-aging, preventive medicine. Here, we review data relative to biological aging clocks and omics-based data, suggesting different organ-specific aging rates. Additional research on longitudinal data, including young subjects and analyzing sex-related differences, should be encouraged to apply ageotyping analysis for preventive purposes in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Arthritis has become the most common joint disease globally. Current attention has shifted towards preventing the disease and exploring pharmaceutical and surgical treatments for early-stage arthritis. M2 macrophages are known for their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to support cartilage repair, offering relief from arthritis. Whereas, it remains a great challenge to promote the beneficial secretion of M2 macrophages to prevent the progression of arthritis. Therefore, it is warranted to investigate new strategies that could use the functions of M2 macrophages and enhance its therapeutic effects. This review aims to explore the macrophage cell membrane-coated biomimetic nanovesicles for targeted treatment of arthritis such as osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and gouty arthritis (GA). Cell membrane-camouflaged biomimetic nanovesicle has attracted increasing attention, which successfully combine the advantages and properties of both cell membrane and delivered drug. We discuss the roles of macrophages in the pathophysiology and therapeutic targets of arthritis. Then, the common preparation strategies of macrophage membrane-coated nanovesicles are concluded. Moreover, we investigate the applications of macrophage cell membrane-camouflaged nanovesicles for arthritis, such as OA, RA, and GA. Taken together, macrophage cell membrane-camouflaged nanovesicles hold the tremendous prospect for biomedical applications in the targeted treatment of arthritis.",

    "abstract": "The last decade has seen remarkable progress in the characterization of methylation clocks that can serve as indicators of biological age in humans and many other mammalian species. While the biological processes of aging that underlie these clocks have remained unclear, several clues have pointed to a link to developmental mechanisms. These include the presence in the vicinity of clock CpG sites of genes that specify development, including those of the Hox (homeobox) and polycomb classes. Here we discuss how recent advances in programmatic theories of aging provide a framework within which methylation clocks can be understood as part of a developmental process of aging. This includes how such clocks evolve, how developmental mechanisms cause aging, and how they give rise to late-life disease. The combination of ideas from evolutionary biology, biogerontology and developmental biology open a path to a new discipline, that of developmental gerontology (devo-gero). Drawing on the properties of methylation clocks, we offer several new hypotheses that exemplify devo-gero thinking. We suggest that polycomb controls a trade-off between earlier developmental fidelity and later developmental plasticity. We also propose the existence of an evolutionarily-conserved developmental sequence spanning ontogenesis, adult development and aging, that both constrains and determines the evolution of aging.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of cognitive impairment worldwide. Overweight and obesity are strongly associated with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and insulin resistance (IR), which contribute substantially to the development of AD and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Adipose tissue (AT) is a highly dynamic organ composed of a diverse array of cell types, which can be classified based on their anatomic localization or cellular composition. The expansion and remodeling of AT in the context of obesity involves immunometabolic and functional shifts steered by the intertwined actions of multiple immune cells and cytokine signaling within AT, which contribute to the development of metabolic disorders, IR, and systemic markers of chronic low-grade inflammation. Chronic low-grade inflammation, a prolonged, low-dose stimulation by specific immunogens that can progress from localized sites and affect multiple organs throughout the body, leads to neurodystrophy, increased apoptosis, and disruption of homeostasis, manifesting as brain atrophy and AD-related pathology. In this review, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms by which AT contributes to the onset and progression of AD in obesity through the mediation of chronic low-grade inflammation, particularly focusing on the roles of adipokines and AT-resident immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major global health problem today and is the most common form of dementia. AD is characterized by the formation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary clusters, leading to decreased brain acetylcholine levels in the brain. Another mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of AD is the abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein that accumulates at the level of neurofibrillary aggregates, and the areas most affected by this pathological process are usually the cholinergic neurons in cortical, subcortical, and hippocampal areas. These effects result in decreased cognitive function, brain atrophy, and neuronal death. Malnutrition and weight loss are the most frequent manifestations of AD, and these are also associated with greater cognitive decline. Several studies have confirmed that a balanced low-calorie diet and proper nutritional intake may be considered important factors in counteracting or slowing the progression of AD, whereas a high-fat or hypercholesterolemic diet predisposes to an increased risk of developing AD. Especially, fruits, vegetables, antioxidants, vitamins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and micronutrients supplementation exert positive effects on aging-related changes in the brain due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and radical scavenging properties. The purpose of this review is to summarize some possible nutritional factors that may contribute to the progression or prevention of AD, understand the role that nutrition plays in the formation of Aβ plaques typical of this neurodegenerative disease, to identify some potential therapeutic strategies that may involve some natural compounds, in delaying the progression of the disease.",

Therefore, we aimed to capture the breadth of outcomes reported and assess the strength of evidence of the use of deprescribing for health outcomes. Umbrella review of systematic reviews of the use of deprescribing searching in Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science until 01 November 2023. The grading of evidence was carried out using the GRADE for intervention studies, whilst data regarding systematic reviews were reported as narrative findings. Among 456 papers, 12 systematic reviews (six with meta-analysis) for a total of 231 RCTs and 44,193 patients were included. In any setting, deprescribing was able to significantly reduce the number of total and of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in older patients (low certainty of evidence) and to reduce the proportion of participants potentially having several or PIMs (moderate certainty of evidence). In community, supported by a high certainty of evidence, deprescribing was not more effective than standard care in decreasing injurious falls, any falls or number of fallers. In nursing home, deprescribing was associated with a significantly lower PIMs than standard care (very low certainty of evidence). In end-of-life situations, deprescribing significantly reduced mortality rate of approximately 41% (high certainty of evidence). Deprescribing is a promising intervention across different settings and situations, but a notable gap in the literature concerning its effects on substantial outcomes still exists.",

    "abstract": "The human female reproductive lifespan significantly diminishes with age, leading to decreased fertility, reduced fertility quality and endocrine function disorders. While many aspects of aging in general have been extensively documented, the precise mechanisms governing programmed aging in the female reproductive system remain elusive. Recent advancements in omics technologies and computational capabilities have facilitated the emergence of multiomics deep phenotyping. Through the application and refinement of various high-throughput omics methods, a substantial volume of omics data has been generated, deepening our comprehension of the pathogenesis and molecular underpinnings of reproductive aging. This review highlights current and emerging multiomics approaches for investigating female reproductive aging, encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics. We elucidate their influence on fundamental cell biology and translational research in the context of reproductive aging, address the limitations and current challenges associated with multiomics studies, and offer a glimpse into future prospects.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) remain a global health challenge. Previous studies have reported potential links between environmental factors and NDDs, however, findings remain controversial across studies and elusive to be interpreted as evidence of robust causal associations. In this study, we comprehensively explored the causal associations of the common environmental factors with major NDDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), based on updated large-scale genome-wide association study data through two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. Our results indicated that, overall, 28 significant sets of exposure-outcome causal association evidence were detected, 12 of which were previously underestimated and newly identified, including average weekly beer plus cider intake, strenuous sports or other exercises, diastolic blood pressure, and body fat percentage with AD, alcohol intake frequency with PD, apolipoprotein B, systolic blood pressure, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) with ALS, and alcohol intake frequency, hip circumference, forced vital capacity, and FEV1 with MS. Moreover, the causal effects of several environmental factors on NDDs were found to overlap. From a triangulation perspective, our investigation provided insights into understanding the associations of environmental factors with NDDs, providing causality-oriented evidence to establish the risk profile of NDDs.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblasts are abundant stromal cells which not only control the integrity of extracellular matrix (ECM) but also act as immune regulators. It is known that the structural cells within tissues can establish an organ-specific immunity expressing many immune-related genes and closely interact with immune cells. In fact, fibroblasts can modify their immune properties to display both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities in a context-dependent manner. After acute insults, fibroblasts promote tissue inflammation although they concurrently recruit immunosuppressive cells to enhance the resolution of inflammation. In chronic pathological states, tissue fibroblasts, especially senescent fibroblasts, can display many pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties and stimulate the activities of different immunosuppressive cells. In return, immunosuppressive cells, such as M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), evoke an excessive conversion of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, thus aggravating the severity of tissue fibrosis. Single-cell transcriptome studies on fibroblasts isolated from aged tissues have confirmed that tissue fibroblasts express many genes coding for cytokines, chemokines, and complement factors, whereas they lose some fibrogenic properties. The versatile immune properties of fibroblasts and their close cooperation with immune cells indicate that tissue fibroblasts have a crucial role in the aging process and age-related diseases.",

The FRAIL tool has been purposefully designed for clinical application by assisting healthcare professionals in identifying and managing frailty-related issues in older adults, making it a preferred choice for assessing frailty across diverse older populations. This review aimed to synthesize the measurement properties and feasibility of FRAIL. Guided by COSMIN guidelines, seven databases were searched from inception to 31 Mar 2023. The measurement properties were extracted for quality appraisal of the populations in the studied samples. Where possible, random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were used for quantitative synthesis. Eighteen articles containing 273 tests were drawn from 14 different populations. We found that populations testing for criterion validity had high-quality ratings, while construct validity ratings varied based on health status and geographical region. Test-retest reliability had sufficient quality ratings, while scale agreement had sufficient ratings in only four out of 14 populations tested. Responsiveness ratings were insufficient in seven out of eight populations, with inconsistent ratings in one population. Our analysis of missing data across three articles showed a 16.3% rate, indicating good feasibility of the FRAIL. FRAIL is a feasible tool for assessing frailty of older adults in community settings, with good criterion validity and test-retest reliability. However, more research is needed on construct validity and responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Treatment-resistant late-life depression (TRLLD) affects nearly half of older adults with major depression. This systematic review evaluates published evidence of effectiveness of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for TRLLD. A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and online trial registries up to March 2024 was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for TRLLD. Seven studies assessed the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions (antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, or ketamine) and another seven examined non-pharmacological approaches (psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and computerized cognitive remediation). Aripiprazole (2 studies), venlafaxine (1 study), ketamine (1 study), and lithium (1 study) were associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms post-treatment compared to the comparator treatment group. rTMS (2 studies), sequential bilateral theta burst stimulation (1 study) and cognitive remediation (1 study) also showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms post-treatment compared to a comparator treatment group. Quality of evidence varied from very low to medium among the included studies. Most studies reported data on small sample sizes. We identified a small number of RCTs evaluating treatments for TRLLD. Aripiprazole augmentation appears to be an effective treatment based on two studies, with an acceptable side effect profile. Other treatments may be effective, but the evidence is based on very low-quality evidence. Future large-scale RCTs are urgently needed to draw firm conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke (IS) is a devastating disease with high disability and mortality rates worldwide. Despite advances in medical treatment, managing IS remains a significant challenge. In China, traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHMs) are often sought as alternative pharmacotherapies for both prevention and rehabilitation because of their proven efficacy and relatively low incidence of adverse reactions. While TCHMs do have certain limitations, their value cannot be overlooked. Centuries of clinical experience in China have established TCHMs as promising approaches for improving clinical outcomes and accelerating drug discovery in the treatment of IS. In this review, we summarize the potential mechanisms and clinical evidence of TCHMs in the treatment of IS in China. These findings suggest that TCHMs can treat IS through various pharmacological mechanisms, mainly anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, antioxidative stress, and mitochondrial regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, TCHMs provide protection to the blood-brain barrier, inhibit excitotoxicity, promote angiogenesis, reduce ferroptosis, modulate the gut-brain axis, prevent thrombosis, improve blood rheology, and regulate neural stem cells. These effects contribute to improved therapeutic outcomes at various stages of IS and poststroke complications, especially when combined with Western medicine, while also offering a favorable safety profile. In conclusion, TCHMs represent a promising strategy for managing IS and advancing related drug development. We hope that this review will inspire further exploration into the mechanisms underlying the anti-IS effects of TCHMs, thereby enhancing the scientific understanding of traditional Chinese medicine.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the world's fourth highest reason for mortality, accounting for 3.5 million deaths in 2021, and about 5% of total global deaths. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two major pathologies of COPD. Tobacco smoke, dust, vapors, and fumes, outdoor air pollutants, genetic factors, ageing, infections, and asthma are the risk factors of COPD. On the other hand, senescence is permanent halt in cell cycle accompanied by phenotypic alterations due to ageing, oxidative stress like; irreparable DNA damage, telomere shortening, oncogene activation or inactivation of tumor suppressors. COPD is often considered an accelerated ageing process of the lungs, with senescent cells impairing tissue repair and regeneration, causing progressive lung function decline. Although, cellular senescence is seen as powerful defense against risk of carcinogenesis in COPD as it arrests cell proliferation irreversibly, excessive collection of senescent cells releases senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that increase oxidative stress to lungs and leads to long-term inflammation, tissue damage, and hindered lung recovery. This review will address the accelerated ageing process and cellular senescence in COPD, therapeutic approaches targeting senescence regulation in COPD; clinical research and trial studies demonstrating the use of therapies aimed at senescence in COPD along with current obstacles and potential solutions.",

    "abstract": "Research into the genetic component of human longevity can provide important insights in mechanisms that may protect against age-related diseases and multi-morbidity. Thus far only a limited number of robust longevity loci have been detected in either candidate or genome wide association studies. One of the issues in these genetic studies is the definition of the trait being either lifespan, including any age at death or longevity, i.e. survival above a diverse series of thresholds. Likewise heritability and segregation research have conflated lifespan with longevity. The heritability of lifespan estimated across most studies has been rather low. Environmental factors have not been sufficiently investigated and the total amount of genetic variance contributing to longevity has not been estimated in sufficiently well-defined and powered studies. Up to now, genetic longevity studies lack the required insights into the nature and size of the genetic component and the optimal strategies for meta-analysis and subject selection for Next Generation Sequencing efforts. Historical demographic data containing deep genealogical information may help in estimating the best definition and heritability for longevity, its transmission patterns in multi-generational datasets and may allow relevant additive and modifying environmental factors such as socio-economic status, geographical background, exposure to environmental effects, birth order, and number of children to be included. In this light historical demographic data may be very useful for identifying lineages in human populations that are worth investigating further by geneticists.",

The molecular defects associated with MAD are mutations in LMNA or ZMPSTE24 (FACE1) gene, causing type A or type B MAD, respectively. Downstream of LMNA or ZMPSTE24 mutations, the lamin A precursor, prelamin A, is accumulated in cells and affects chromatin dynamics and stress response. A new form of mandibuloacral dysplasia has been recently associated with mutations in POLD1 gene, encoding DNA polymerase delta, a major player in DNA replication. Of note, involvement of prelamin A in chromatin dynamics and recruitment of DNA repair factors has been also determined under physiological conditions, at the border between stress response and cellular senescence. Here, we review current knowledge on MAD clinical and pathogenetic aspects and highlight aspects typical of physiological ageing.",

While mutant huntingtin (mHtt) is widely expressed from early life, most patients with HD present in mid-adulthood, highlighting the role of ageing in disease pathogenesis. mHtt undergoes proteolytic cleavage, misfolding, accumulation, and aggregation into inclusion bodies. The emerging model of HD pathogenesis proposes that the chronic production of misfolded mHtt overwhelms the chaperone machinery, diverting other misfolded clients to the proteasome and the autophagy pathways, ultimately leading to a global collapse of the proteostasis network. Multiple converging hypotheses also implicate ageing and its impact in the dysfunction of organelles as additional contributing factors to the collapse of proteostasis in HD. In particular, mitochondrial function is required to sustain the activity of ATP-dependent chaperones and proteolytic machinery. Recent studies elucidating mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum interactions and uncovering a dedicated proteostasis machinery in mitochondria, suggest that mitochondria play a more active role in the maintenance of cellular proteostasis than previously thought. The enhancement of cytosolic proteostasis pathways shows promise for HD treatment, protecting cells from the detrimental effects of mHtt accumulation. In this review, we consider how mHtt and its post translational modifications interfere with protein quality control pathways, and how the pharmacological and genetic modulation of components of the proteostasis network impact disease phenotypes in cellular and in vivo HD models.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms which relentlessly and progressively lead to substantial disability and economic burden. Pathologically, these symptoms follow the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) associated with abnormal α-synuclein (α-Syn) deposition as cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies in pigmented brainstem nuclei, and in dystrophic neurons in striatal and cortical regions (Lewy neurites). Pharmacotherapy for PD focuses on improving quality of life and primarily targets dopaminergic pathways. Dopamine acts through two families of receptors, dopamine D1-like and dopamine D2-like; dopamine D3 receptors (D3R) belong to dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) family. Although D3R's precise role in the pathophysiology and treatment of PD has not been determined, we present evidence suggesting an important role for D3R in the early development and occurrence of PD. Agonist activation of D3R increases dopamine concentration, decreases α-Syn accumulation, enhances secretion of brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), ameliorates neuroinflammation, alleviates oxidative stress, promotes neurogenesis in the nigrostriatal pathway, interacts with D1R to reduce PD associated motor symptoms and ameliorates side effects of levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment. Furthermore, D3R mutations can predict PD age of onset and prognosis of PD treatment. The role of D3R in PD merits further research. This review elucidates the potential role of D3R in PD pathogenesis and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Radical lifespan disparities exist in the animal kingdom. While the ocean quahog can survive for half a millennium, the mayfly survives for less than 48 h. The evolutionary theories of aging seek to explain why such stark longevity differences exist and why a deleterious process like aging evolved. The classical mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and disposable soma theories predict that increased extrinsic mortality should select for the evolution of shorter lifespans and vice versa. Most experimental and comparative field studies conform to this prediction. Indeed, animals with extreme longevity (e.g., Greenland shark, bowhead whale, giant tortoise, vestimentiferan tubeworms) typically experience minimal predation. However, data from guppies, nematodes, and computational models show that increased extrinsic mortality can sometimes lead to longer evolved lifespans. The existence of theoretically immortal animals that experience extrinsic mortality – like planarian flatworms, panther worms, and hydra – further challenges classical assumptions. Octopuses pose another puzzle by exhibiting short lifespans and an uncanny intelligence, the latter of which is often associated with longevity and reduced extrinsic mortality. The evolutionary response to extrinsic mortality is likely dependent on multiple interacting factors in the organism, population, and ecology, including food availability, population density, reproductive cost, age-mortality interactions, and the mortality source.",

Most high-profile pharmacological treatments for age-related CVD have led to inefficacious results, implying that novel approaches to treating these pathologies are needed. Emerging data have demonstrated that senescent cardiovascular cells, which are characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest and a distinct senescence-associated secretory phenotype, accumulate in aged or diseased cardiovascular systems, suggesting that they may impair cardiovascular function. This review discusses the evidence implicating senescent cells in cardiovascular ageing, the onset and progression of CVD, and the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular cell senescence. We also review eradication of senescent cardiovascular cells by small-molecule-drug-mediated apoptosis and immune cell-mediated efferocytosis and toxicity as promising and precisely targeted therapeutics for CVD prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "As the world's population progressively ages, the burden on the socio-economic and health systems is escalating, demanding sustainable and lasting solutions. Cellular senescence, one of the hallmarks of ageing, is a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to various genotoxic stressors and is considered an important factor in the development of many age-related diseases and therefore a potential therapeutic target. Here, the role of senescent cells in age-related diseases is discussed, focusing on their formation and main characteristics. The mechanisms leading to senescent cells are presented, including replicative and premature senescence as well as senescence that occurs in various physiological processes, such as wound healing. The second part comprises a comprehensive description of various biomarkers currently used for the detection of senescent cells along with the investigated therapeutic approaches, namely senolytics, senomorphics and the clearance of senescent cells by the immune system. Potential delivery systems suitable for such therapies and model organisms to study senescence are also briefly examined. This in-depth overview of cellular senescence contributes to a deeper understanding of a rapidly evolving area aimed to tackle the age-related diseases in a more mechanistic way, as well as highlights future research opportunities.",

The importance of it for aging makes it a key target for interventions.

    "abstract": "Aging is generally characterized as a gradual increase in tissue damage, which is associated with senescence and chronic systemic inflammation and is evident in a variety of age-related diseases. The extent to which such tissue damage is a result of a gradual decline in immune regulation, which consequently compromises the capacity of the body to repair damages, has not been fully explored. Whereas CD4 T lymphocytes play a critical role in the orchestration of immunity, thymus involution initiates gradual changes in the CD4 T-cell landscape, which may significantly compromise tissue repair. In this review, we describe the lifespan accumulation of specific dysregulated CD4 T-cell subsets and their coevolution with systemic inflammation in the process of declined immunity and tissue repair capacity with age. Then, we discuss the process of thymus involution—which appears to be most pronounced around puberty—as a possible driver of the aging T-cell landscape. Finally, we identify individualized T cell-based early diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "The responses of central nervous system (CNS) cells such as neurons and glia in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) suggest that regulation of neuronal and glial functions could be a strategy for ND prevention and/or treatment. However, attempts to develop such therapeutics for NDs have been hindered by the challenge of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and continued constitutive neuronal loss. These limitations indicate the need for additional perspectives for the prevention/treatment of NDs. In particular, the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that accompanies NDs allows brain infiltration by peripheral factors, which may stimulate innate immune responses involved in the progression of neurodegeneration. The accumulation of blood factors like thrombin, fibrinogen, c-reactive protein (CRP) and complement components in the brain has been observed in NDs and may activate the innate immune system in the CNS. Thus, strengthening the integrity of the BBB may enhance its protective role to attenuate ND progression and functional loss. In this review, we describe the innate immune system in the CNS and the contribution of blood factors to the role of the CNS immune system in neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.",

However, the mechanisms which determine why particular regions within the nervous system are selectively vulnerable to neurodegeneration, whilst others remain relatively unaffected throughout disease progression, remain elusive. Here, we review how regional susceptibility to the ubiquitous physiological phenomenon of normal ageing might underlie the vulnerability of these same regions to neurodegeneration, highlighting three regions archetypally associated with AD, PD and ALS (the hippocampus, substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral spinal cord, respectively), as especially prone to age-related alterations. Placing particular emphasis on these three regions, we comprehensively explore differential regional susceptibility to nervous system tissue, cellular and molecular level ageing to provide an integrated perspective on why age-related neurodegenerative diseases exhibit region-selective vulnerability. Combining these principles with increasingly recognised differences between chronological and biological ageing (termed differential or 'delta' ageing) might ultimately guide therapeutic approaches for these devastating neurodegenerative diseases, for which a paucity of disease modifying and/or life promoting treatments currently exist.",

It elaborates on recent changes in the AD research strategy for broadening drug targets, and potentials of emerging non-pharmacological treatment interventions. Established and novel biomarkers are discussed, including emerging cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers reflecting tau pathology, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These fluid biomarkers together with neuroimaging findings can provide innovative objective assessments of subtle changes in brain reflecting disease progression. A particular emphasis is given to neurophysiological biomarkers which are well-suited for evaluating the brain overall neural network integrity and function.

    "abstract": "Aging is a progressive degenerative process involving a chronic low-grade inflammation and the accumulation of senescent cells. One major issue is to reveal the mechanisms which promote the deposition of pro-inflammatory senescent cells within tissues. The accumulation involves mechanisms which increase cellular senescence as well as those inhibiting the clearance of senescent cells from tissues. It is known that a persistent inflammatory state evokes a compensatory immunosuppression which inhibits pro-inflammatory processes by impairing the functions of effector immune cells, e.g., macrophages, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Unfortunately, these cells are indispensable for immune surveillance and the subsequent clearance of senescent cells, i.e., the inflammation-induced counteracting immunosuppression prevents the cleansing of host tissues. Moreover, senescent cells can also repress their own clearance by expressing inhibitors of immune surveillance and releasing the ligands of NKG2D receptors which impair their surveillance by NK and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. It seems that cellular senescence and immunosuppression establish a feed-forward process which promotes the aging process and age-related diseases. I will examine in detail the immunosuppressive mechanisms which impair the surveillance and clearance of pro-inflammatory senescent cells with aging. In addition, I will discuss several therapeutic strategies to halt the degenerative feed-forward circuit associated with the aging process and age-related diseases.",

It is regarded as the main cause of chronic low back pain in the elderly. IDD has various causes, including ageing, mechanical overloading, and nutritional deficiency. Melatonin is a pleiotropic indole hormone secreted by the pineal gland and plays an important role in resisting various degenerative diseases. The serum levels of melatonin decline with age and are reported to be negatively correlated with the symptomatic and histopathological scores of IDD. In vivo studies have shown that exogenous administration of melatonin could maintain the structural integrity of the intervertebral disc and inhibit the development of IDD. Mechanistically, by interacting with its membrane or intracellular receptors, melatonin can promote autophagic flux, scavenge free radicals, inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory factors, and block apoptotic pathways, thereby enhancing anti-stress abilities and matrix anabolism in different types of disc cells. Therefore, melatonin supplementation may be a promising therapeutic strategy for IDD. This review aimed to summarize the latest findings regarding the therapeutic potential of melatonin in IDD.",

The role of senescence in age-related disease has been assessed in 9 different human organ system and 27 different age-related diseases of which heart (27/103) and the respiratory systems (18/103) are the most investigated. Overall, 27 different markers of senescence have been used to determine cellular senescence and the cell cycle regulator p16ink4a is most often used (23/27 age-related pathologies).This review demonstrates that a higher expression of senescence markers are observed within disease pathologies. However, not all markers to detect senescence have been assessed in all tissue types.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that is incurable. Despite recent success in treatments that partially improve symptomatic relief, they have failed in most clinical trials. Re-holding AD for accurate diagnosis and treatment is widely known as a challenging task. Lack of knowledge of basic molecular pathogenesis might be a possible reason for ineffective AD treatment. Historically, a majority of therapy-based studies have investigated the role of amyloid-β (Aβ peptide) in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas less is known about Aβ peptide in the periphery in AD. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the current understanding of Aβ peptide metabolism (anabolism and catabolism) in the brain and periphery. We show that the abnormal metabolism of Aβ peptide is significantly linked with central-brain and peripheral abnormalities; the interaction between peripheral Aβ peptide metabolism and peripheral abnormalities affects central-brain Aβ peptide metabolism, suggesting the existence of significant communication between these two pathways of Aβ peptide metabolism. This close interaction between the central brain and periphery in abnormal Aβ peptide metabolism plays a key role in the development and progression of AD. In conclusion, we need to obtain a full understanding of the dynamic roles of Aβ peptide at the molecular level in both the brain and periphery in relation to the pathology of AD. This will not only provide new information regarding the complex disease pathology, but also offer potential new clues to improve therapeutic strategies and diagnostic biomarkers for the successful treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Malnutrition, in particular protein-energy malnutrition, is a highly prevalent condition in older adults, and is associated with low muscle mass and function, and increased prevalence of physical frailty. Malnutrition is often exacerbated in the residential care setting due to factors including lack of dentition and appetite, and increased prevalence of dementia and dysphagia. This review aims to provide an overview of the available literature in older adults in the residential care setting regarding the following: links between sarcopenia, frailty, and malnutrition (in particular, protein-energy malnutrition (PEM)), recognition and diagnosis of malnutrition, factors contributing to PEM, and the effectiveness of different forms of protein supplementation (in particular, oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) and protein-fortified foods (PFF)) to target PEM. This review found a lack of consensus on effective malnutrition diagnostic tools and lack of universal requirement for malnutrition screening in the residential care setting, making identifying and treating malnutrition in this population a challenge. When assessing the use of protein supplementation in the residential care setting, the two primary forms of supplementation were ONS and PFF. There is evidence that ONS and PFF increase protein and energy intakes in residential care setting, yet compliance with supplementation and their impact on functional status is unclear and conflicting. Further research comparing the use of ONS and PFF is needed to fully determine feasibility and efficacy of protein supplementation in the residential care setting.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the bidirectional association between the kidney dysfunction and the brain health, including structural and functional abnormalities.Systematic review and meta-analysis with network meta-analysis for outcomes with different estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ranges.PubMed, Embase database, Cochrane library and Web of Science (up to Dec. 2021).Longitudinal studies that provided evidence of the impact of kidney function estimated from eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) on structural and functional brain abnormalities, and those that provided evidence of the opposite relationship. Studies with study population mean age under 18 years old were excluded.Two independent reviewers screened the included studies, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis for outcomes with compatible data. We assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale criteria (NOS). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore heterogeneity in the meta-analyses. Inconsistency analyses using the node-splitting method were performed to confirm the results of network meta-analysis.A total of 53 studies with 3037,357 participants were included in the current systematic review. Among these, 16 provided evidence of structural brain abnormalities, and 38 provided evidence of cognitive impairment and dementia. Analysis of evidence of categorical kidney function showed a positive association between kidney dysfunction and cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) (relative risk (RR) 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.24, I2 = 0.0%), but such results were not found in the analyses of evidence where the kidney function was measured as a continuous variable. Meanwhile, analysis of 28 prior longitudinal studies with 194 compatible sets of data showed that the worse kidney function as categorical variables was related to a greater risk of global brain cognitive disorder (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.20-1.36, I2 = 82.5%).In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found a positive association between CKD and functional brain disorders. However, the relationship between the kidney dysfunction and structural abnormalities in the brain remains controversial. As for the opposite relationship, structural brain abnormalities, especially cerebral microbleeds and silent infarction, but not functional brain abnormalities, are associated with worse renal function. In addition, a higher UACR, but not a lower eGFR, was associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.",

We meta-analysed the data and calculated the pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances in people with dementia overall and in dementia subtypes. We used meta-regressions to investigate the effects of study characteristics, publication dates and participant demographics. Eleven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of any symptoms of sleep disturbance was 26 % (95 % confidence intervals, CI: 23-30 %; n = 2719) and of clinically significant sleep disturbance 19 % (13-25 %; n = 2753). The pooled prevalence of sleep disturbance symptoms was significantly lower among people with Alzheimer's disease (24 %; 16-33 %, n = 310) than Lewy body dementia (49 %; 37-61 %, n = 65). Meta-regression analysis did not find that publication year, participant's age, sex and study quality predicted prevalence. Sleep disturbances are common among people with dementia living in the community, especially in Lewy body dementia. There was no change in prevalence according to publication dates, suggesting treatment has not improved over time.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence has gained increasing interest during recent years, particularly due to causal involvement in the aging process corroborated by multiple experimental findings. Indeed, cellular senescence considered to be one of the hallmarks of aging, is defined as a stable growth arrest predominantly mediated by cell cycle regulators p53, p21 and p16. Senescent cells have frequently been studied in the peripheral blood of humans due to its accessibility. This review summarizes ex vivo studies describing cell cycle regulators as markers of senescence in human peripheral blood cells, along with detection methodologies and associative studies examining demographic and clinical characteristics. The utility of techniques such as the quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), microarray, RNA sequencing and nCounter technologies for detection at the transcriptional level, along with Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry at the translational level, will be brought up at salient points throughout this review. Notably, housekeeping genes or proteins serving as controls such as GAPDH and β-Actin, were found not to be stably expressed in some contexts. As such, optimization and validation of such genes during experimental design were recommended. In addition, the expression of cell cycle regulators was found to vary not only between different types of blood cells such as T cells and B cells but also between stages of cellular differentiation such as naïve T cells and highly differentiated T cells. On the other hand, the associations of the presence of cell cycle regulators with demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status), clinical characteristics (body mass index, specific diseases, disease-related parameters) and lifestyle vary in groups of participants. One envisions that increased understanding and insights into the assessment of cell cycle regulators as markers of senescence in human peripheral blood cells will help inform prognostication and clinical intervention in elderly individuals.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) increases with ageing. T2D generally results from progressive impairment of the pancreatic islets to adapt β-cell mass and function in the setting of insulin resistance and increased insulin demand. Several studies have shown an age-related decline in peripheral insulin sensitivity. However, a precise understanding of the pancreatic β-cell response in ageing is still lacking. In this review, we summarize the age-related alterations, adaptations and/or failures of β-cells at the molecular, morphological and functional levels in mouse and human. Age-associated alterations include processes such as β-cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell identity that can influence β-cell mass. Age-related changes also affect β-cell function at distinct steps including electrical activity, Ca2+ signaling and insulin secretion, among others. We will consider the potential impact of these alterations and those mediated by senescence pathways on β-cells and their implications in age-related T2D. Finally, given the great diversity of results in the field of β-cell ageing, we will discuss the sources of this heterogeneity. A better understanding of β-cell biology during ageing, particularly at older ages, will improve our insight into the contribution of β-cells to age-associated T2D and may boost new therapeutic strategies.",

We searched PubMed and Embase (January 1, 2010—August 24, 2022) and finally included 14 longitudinal studies (311654 participants with 8006 incident dementia cases). Random-effects meta-analysis and one-stage linear mixed-effects models were performed. Increased CVH score seemed to associate with decreased risk of incident dementia in a linear manner, but this relationship varied by the measurement age of CVH metrics. That is, midlife CVH tended to have a linear association with late-life dementia risk, whereas a J-shaped association was observed between the late-life CVH score and dementia. In addition, late-life dementia risk was reduced significantly if individuals maintained an ideal level of AHA’s CVH guidelines of physical activity, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, and smoking. However, our meta-analysis did not show a significant association between CVH score and global cognitive decline rate. Following AHA’s CVH guidelines and maintaining CVH at an optimal level would substantially reduce the late-life dementia risk. More research is required to explore the link between a favorable CVH score and cognitive trajectories among cognitively asymptomatic older populations.",

    "abstract": "There has been growing interest in brain aging and rejuvenation. It is well known that brain aging is one of the leading causes of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, but brain aging alone can cause cognitive decline. Microglia are thought to act as 'conductors' of white matter aging by modulating diverse glial cells and phagocytosing white matter-derived myelin debris. A recent study identified a specific subpopulation of microglia in the white matter of aged mice, termed white matter-associated microglia (WAM). Additionally, senescent microglia show impaired phagocytic function and altered lipid metabolism, which cause accumulation of lipid metabolites and eventually lead to myelin sheath degeneration. These results suggest that senescent WAM could be pivotal players in axonal loss during brain aging. The aim of this review is to assess the current state of knowledge on brain aging, with an emphasis on the roles of the white matter and microglia, and suggest potential approaches for rejuvenating the aged brain.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incredibly complex and presently incurable age-related brain disorder. To better understand this debilitating disease, we collated and performed a meta-analysis on publicly available RNA-Seq, microarray, proteomics, and microRNA samples derived from AD patients and non-AD controls. 4089 samples originating from brain tissues and blood remained after applying quality filters. Since disease progression in AD correlates with age, we stratified this large dataset into three different age groups: < 75 years, 75-84 years, and ≥ 85 years. The RNA-Seq, microarray, and proteomics datasets were then combined into different integrated datasets. Ensemble machine learning was employed to identify genes and proteins that can accurately classify samples as either AD or control. These predictive inputs were then subjected to network-based enrichment analyses. The ability of genes/proteins associated with different pathways in the Molecular Signatures Database to diagnose AD was also tested. We separately identified microRNAs that can be used to make an AD diagnosis and subjected the predicted gene targets of the most predictive microRNAs to an enrichment analysis. The following key themes emerged from our machine learning and bioinformatics analyses: cell death, cellular senescence, energy metabolism, genomic integrity, glia, immune system, metal ion homeostasis, oxidative stress, proteostasis, and synaptic function. Many of the results demonstrated unique age-specificity. For example, terms highlighting cellular senescence only emerged in the earliest and intermediate age ranges while the majority of results relevant to cell death appeared in the youngest patients. Existing literature corroborates the importance of these hallmarks in AD.",

Pubmed Central, Medline, CINAHL Plus and PsychINFO were searched between March 1, 2020, and September 30, 2022. We included all studies that assessed proportions of older adults with the mean or the median with a minimum age above 60 reporting worsening cognitive function and mental health. Thirty-two studies from 18 countries met the eligibility criteria for meta-analyses. We found that the proportions of older adults with dementia who experienced worsening cognitive impairment and exacerbation or new onset of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were approximately twice larger than that of older adults with HC experiencing SCD and worsening mental health. Stage of dementia, care options, and severity of mobility restriction measures did not yield significant differences in the number of older adults with dementia reporting worsening cognitive impairment and BPSD, while the length of isolation did for BPSD but not cognitive impairment. Our study highlights the impact of social isolation on cognitive function and mental health among older adults. Public health strategies should prioritize efforts to promote healthy lifestyles and proactive assessments.",

    "abstract": "Aerobic exercise (AE) may slow age-related cognitive decline. However, such cognition-sparing effects are not uniform across cognitive domains and studies. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation and is also emerging as a potential alternative to pharmaceutical therapies. Like AE, the effectiveness of tDCS is also inconsistent for reducing cognitive impairment in ageing. The unexplored possibility exists that pairing AE and tDCS could produce synergistic effects and reciprocally augment cognition-improving effects in older individuals with and without cognitive impairments. Previous research found such synergistic effects on cognition when cognitive training is paired with tDCS in older individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to explore if pairing AE with tDCS could augment singular effects of AE and tDCS on global cognition (GC), working memory (WM) and executive function (EF) in older individuals with or without MCI and dementia. Using a PRISMA-based systematic review, we compiled studies that examined the effects of AE alone, tDCS alone, and AE and tDCS combined on cognitive function in older individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Using a PICOS approach, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science searches up to December 2021, we focused on ‘MoCA’, ‘MMSE’, ‘Mini-Cog’ (measures) and ‘cognition’, ‘cognitive function’, ‘cognitive’, ‘cognitive performance’, ‘executive function’, ‘executive process’, ‘attention’, ‘memory’, ‘memory performance’ (outcome terms). We included only randomized controlled trials (RTC) in humans if available in English full text over the past 20 years, with participants’ age over 60. We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies (RTC) by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Overall, 68 studies were included in the meta-analyses. AE (ES = 0.56 [95% CI: 0.28–0.83], p = 0.01) and tDCS (ES = 0.69 [95% CI: 0.12–1.26], p = 0.02) improved GC in all three groups of older adults combined (healthy, MCI, demented). In healthy population, AE improved GC (ES = 0.46 [95% CI: 0.22–0.69], p = 0.01) and EF (ES = 0.27 [95% CI: 0.05–0.49], p = 0.02). AE improved GC in older adults with MCI (ES = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.21–1.32], p = 0.01). tDCS improved GC (ES = 0.69 [90% CI: 0.12–1.26], p = 0.02), all three cognitive function (GC, WM and EF) combined in older adults with dementia (ES = 1.12 [95% CI: 0.04–2.19], p = 0.04) and improved cognitive function in older adults overall (ES = 0.69 [95% CI: 0.20–1,18], p = 0.01). Our systematic review with meta-analysis provided evidence that beyond the cardiovascular and fitness benefits of AE, pairing AE with tDCS may have the potential to slow symptom progression of cognitive decline in MCI and dementia. Future studies will examine the hypothesis of this present review that a potentiating effect would incrementally improve cognition with increasing severity of cognitive impairment.",

Remarkably, aging and CVD overlap in numerous ways, with deregulated nutrient sensing as a common mechanism and lifestyle as a communal modifier. Interestingly, lifestyle triggers or suppresses multiple nutrient-related signaling pathways. In this review, we first present the composition of the nutrient-sensing network (NSN) and its metabolic impact on aging and CVD. Secondly, we review how risk factors closely associated with CVD, including adverse life states such as sedentary behavior, sleep disorders, high-fat diet, and psychosocial stress, contribute to aging and CVD, with a focus on the bridging role of the NSN. Finally, we focus on the positive effects of beneficial dietary interventions, specifically dietary restriction and the Mediterranean diet, on the regulation of nutrient metabolism and the delayed effects of aging and CVD that depend on the balance of the NSN. In summary, we expound on the interaction between lifestyle, NSN, aging, and CVD.",

Although there are epidemiological studies on the strong relationship between fish or n-3 FA consumption and lower risk of cognitive decline, results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are less consistent. Here, we performed a scoping review on RCTs with n-3 FA supplementation where cognition was evaluated. Seventy-eight RCTs published before April 2022 were included in this review. Among these RCTs, 43.6% reported a positive cognitive outcome after the consumption of n-3 FA compared to the placebo. However, there was a large diversity of populations studied (age ranges and health status), wide range of doses of EPA + DHA supplemented (79 mg/day – 5200 mg/day) and a multitude of tests evaluating cognition, mainly diagnostic tests, that were used to assess cognitive scores and overall cognitive status. RCTs were thereafter categorized into non-cognitively impaired middle-aged adults (n = 24), non-cognitively impaired older adults (n = 24), adults with subjective memory complaints (n = 14), adults with mild cognitive impairments (MCI, n = 9) and people with diagnosed dementia or other cognitive changes (n = 7). Among these categories, 66.7% of RCTs conducted with MCI adults reported a positive cognitive outcome when supplemented with n-3 FA vs. the placebo. Therefore, this scoping review provides rationale and questions to a) strengthen the design of future RCTs with n-3 FA for cognitive outcomes, and b) generate more informative data to support clinicians in their practice in assessing cognition before and after a nutritional intervention.",

    "abstract": "Age-related loss of function brings age-related disease, and therefore it is of primary importance to search for interventions that can help minimize detrimental symptoms people deal with in old age. Fungi have always been given a great deal of attention and reverence in traditional medical practices for their ability to minimize harmful symptoms of diseases. More recently, the role of fungi in influencing healthspan and lifespan is being directly studied in the lab. To treat animal model organisms with fungi-derived molecules, extractions from different life cycle stages of fungi are performed. This includes mycelium (the vegetative stage), sporocarps (the reproductive stage), or spores (the end product of the reproductive stage), and each stage provides a variety of bioactive compounds. These bioactive compounds include glycoproteins, polysaccharides, triterpenoids, meroterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, steroids, alkaloids, benzopyran derivatives, and benzoic acid derivatives, amongst others. In this work, we review evidence that fungal extracts from multiple species can have beneficial effects on the lifespan and healthspan of model organisms, such as C. elegans worms, D. melanogaster flies, and M. musculus mice. We cover extraction methods and lifespan effects of Ganoderma lucidum (i.e. Reishi), Lentinula edodes (i.e. Shiitake), the genus Auricularia (i.e. jelly ear mushrooms), the genera Cordyceps and Ophiocordyceps (e.g. the caterpillar fungi), Hericium erinaceus (i.e. Lion's mane), the mold genus Monascus, and also Inonotus obliquus (i.e. Chaga), Grifola frondosa (i.e. Maitake or hen-of-the-woods), the genus Pleurotus (e.g. oyster mushrooms), and Agaricus subrufescens (i.e. the almond mushroom). We propose that further research on fungal extracts will provide a greater picture of the role fungi-derived bioactive molecules can have in developing longevity and neuroprotective medicines for humans.",

Autophagy is generally considered as a pro-survival mechanism, although its deregulation has been linked to non-apoptotic cell death. Autophagy efficiency declines with age, thus contributing to many different pathophysiological conditions, such as cancer, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, liver disease, autoimmune diseases, infections, and neurodegeneration. Accordingly, it has been proposed that the maintenance of a proper autophagic activity contributes to the extension of the lifespan in different organisms. A better understanding of the interplay between autophagy and risk of age-related pathologies is important to propose nutritional and life-style habits favouring disease prevention as well as possible clinical applications aimed at promoting long-term health.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the available evidence regarding the association between these factors and cerebral macro- and micro-structure. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in various databases, following predefined criteria. Heterogeneity, risk of publication bias and overall certainty of evidence were assessed using standardized scales and, whenever appropriate, random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Of 6715 identified articles, 43 were included. Overall, consistency of findings was low and methodological heterogeneity high for all outcomes. However, in some studies cognitive and social activities were positively associated with total brain, global and cortical grey matter and hippocampal volume as well as white matter microstructural integrity. Furthermore, structural social network characteristics (e.g., social network size) were associated with regional grey matter volumes, while functional social network characteristics (e.g., social support) were additionally associated with total brain volume. Meta-analyses revealed small but significant partial correlations between cognitive and social activities and hippocampal (three studies; n = 892; rz =0.07) and white matter hyperintensity volume (three studies; n = 2934; rz =-0.04). More prospective studies are needed to assess temporal associations.",

    "abstract": "A common feature of adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases is the presence of characteristic pathological accumulations of specific proteins. These pathological protein depositions can vary in their protein composition, cell-type distribution, and intracellular (or extracellular) location. For example, abnormal cytoplasmic protein deposits which consist of the TDP-43 protein are found within motor neurons in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, a common form of motor neuron disease) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The presence of these insoluble intracellular TDP-43 inclusions suggests that restoring TDP-43 homeostasis represents a potential therapeutical strategy, which has been demonstrated in alleviating neurodegenerative symptoms in cell and animal models of ALS/FTD. We have reviewed the mechanisms that lead to disrupted TDP-43 homeostasis and discussed how small molecule-based therapies could be applied in modulating these mechanisms. This review covers recent advancements and challenges in small molecule-based therapies that could be used to clear pathological forms of TDP-43 through various protein homeostasis mechanisms and advance the way towards finding effective therapeutical drug discoveries for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by TDP-43 proteinopathies, especially ALS and FTD. We also consider the wider insight of these therapeutic strategies for other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cardinal motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) include bradykinesia, rest tremor and/or rigidity. This symptomatology can additionally encompass abnormal gait, balance and postural patterns at advanced stages of the disease. Besides pharmacological and surgical therapies, physical exercise represents an important strategy for the management of these advanced impairments. Traditionally, diagnosis and classification of such abnormalities have relied on partially subjective evaluations performed by neurologists during short and temporally scattered hospital appointments. Emerging sports medical methods, including wearable sensor-based movement assessment and computational-statistical analysis, are paving the way for more objective and systematic diagnoses in everyday life conditions. These approaches hold promise to facilitate customizing clinical trials to specific PD groups, as well as personalizing neuromodulation therapies and exercise prescriptions for each individual, remotely and regularly, according to disease progression or specific motor symptoms. We aim to summarize exercise benefits for PD with a specific emphasis on gait and balance deficits, and to provide an overview of recent advances in movement analysis approaches, notably from the sports science community, with value for diagnosis and prognosis. Although such techniques are becoming increasingly available, their standardization and optimization for clinical purposes is critically missing, especially in their translation to complex neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. We highlight the importance of integrating state-of-the-art gait and movement analysis approaches, in combination with other motor, electrophysiological or neural biomarkers, to improve the understanding of the diversity of PD phenotypes, their response to therapies and the dynamics of their disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a pivotal factor contributing to aging and the pathophysiology of age-related diseases. Despite the presence of inflammation and abnormal immune system function in both inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and senescence, the relationship between the two remains largely unexplored. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the intricate connection between cellular senescence, telomeres, and IBD. The review highlights the presence of senescence markers, particularly p16 and p21, in IBD patients, suggesting their potential association with disease progression and mucosal inflammation. We emphasize the critical role of macrophages in eliminating senescent cells and how disturbance in effective clearance may contribute to persistent senescence and inflammation in IBD. Additionally, we shed light on the involvement of telomeres in IBD, as their dysfunction impairs enterocyte function and disrupts colonic barrier integrity, potentially exacerbating the pathogenesis of the disease. Targeting senescence and telomere dysfunctions holds promise for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches to mitigate intestinal inflammation and alleviate symptoms in IBD patients. By unraveling the precise role of senescence in IBD, we can pave the way for the discovery of novel therapeutic interventions that effectively address the underlying mechanisms of intestinal inflammation, offering hope for improved management and treatment of IBD patients.",

    "abstract": "The locomotor system comprises skeletal muscles and bones with active metabolism and cellular turnover. Chronic locomotor system disorders gradually arising with aging are inversely associated with the correct function of bone and muscles. Senescent cells appear more frequently in advanced ages or pathological conditions, and the accumulation of senescent cells in muscle tissue negatively correlates with muscle regeneration, which is crucial for maintaining strength and preventing frailty. Senescence in the bone microenvironment, osteoblasts, and osteocytes affects bone turnover favoring osteoporosis. It is likely that in response to injury and age-related damage over the lifetime, a subset of niche cells accumulates oxidative stress and DNA damage beyond the threshold that primes the onset of cellular senescence. These senescent cells may acquire resistance to apoptosis that, combined with the weakened immune system, results in impaired clearance of senescent cells and their accumulation. The secretory profile of senescent cells causes local inflammation, further spreading senescence in neighboring niche cells and impairing tissue homeostasis. The resulting impairment of turnover/tissue repair in the musculoskeletal system reduces the efficiency of the organ in response to environmental needs that finally lead to functional decline. Management of the musculoskeletal system at the cellular level can benefit the quality of life and reduce early aging. This work discusses current knowledge of cellular senescence of musculoskeletal tissues to conclude with biologically active biomarkers effective enough to reveal the underlying mechanisms of tissue flaws at the earliest possible.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-resident fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells which possess an impressive plasticity in their ability to modify their properties according to the requirements of the microenvironment. There are diverse subgroups of fibroblast phenotypes associated with different tissue pathological conditions, e.g., cancers, wound healing, and many fibrotic and inflammatory conditions. The heterogeneous phenotypes can be subdivided into fibrogenic and non-fibrogenic, inflammatory and immunosuppressive subtypes as well as cellular senescent subsets. A major hallmark of activated fibroblasts is that they contain different amounts of stress fibers combined with α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein, i.e., commonly this phenotype has been called the myofibroblast. Interestingly, several stresses associated with the aging process are potent inducers of myofibroblast differentiation, e.g., oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses, extracellular matrix (ECM) disorders, inflammatory mediators, and telomere shortening. Accordingly, anti-aging treatments with metformin and rapamycin inhibited the differentiation of myofibroblasts in tissues. There is evidence that the senescent phenotype induced in cultured fibroblasts does not represent the phenotype of fibroblasts in aged tissues. Considering the versatile plasticity of fibroblasts as well as their frequency and structural importance in tissues, it does seem that fibroblasts are overlooked players in the aging process.",

Here, we focus on describing the phenotypic spectrum of the aging killifish brain. As turquoise killifish age, their dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons undergo a significant decline in number. Furthermore, brain aging in turquoise killifish is associated with several glial-specific changes, such as an increase in the astrocyte-covered surface area and an increase in the numbers of microglial cells, i.e. the brain-specific macrophage population. Killifish brains undergo age-dependent reduced proteasome activity and increased protein aggregation, including the aggregation of the Parkinson's disease marker α-synuclein. Parallel to brain degeneration, turquoise killifish develop spontaneous age-related gut dysbiosis, which has been proposed to affect human neurodegenerative disease. Finally, aged turquoise killifish display declined learning capacity. We argue that, taken together, the molecular, cellular and functional changes that spontaneously take place during aging in killifish brains are consistent with a robust degenerative process that shares remarkable similarities with human neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, we propose that turquoise killifish represent a powerful model of spontaneous brain degeneration which can be effectively used to explore the causal mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "As the most common bone disease, osteoporosis (OP) increases bone fragility and makes patients more vulnerable to the threat of osteoporotic fractures. With the ageing population in today's society, OP has become a huge and growing public health problem. Unfortunately, the clear pathogenesis of OP is still under exploration, and effective interventions are still scarce. Therefore, exploring new targets for pharmacological interventions to develop promising therapeutic drugs for OP is of great clinical value. Previous studies have shown that normal bone remodeling depends on proteostasis, whereas loss of proteostasis during ageing leads to the dysfunctional proteostasis network (PN) that fails to maintain bone homeostasis. Nevertheless, only a few studies have revealed the pathophysiological relationship between bone metabolism and a single component of PN, yet the role of PN as a whole in the pathogenesis of OP is still under investigation. This review comprehensively summarized the role of PN in the pathogenesis of OP and further discussed the potential of PN as innovative drug targets for the therapy of OP.",

    "abstract": "Dementia, osteoporosis, and fragility fractures are chronic diseases, often co-existing in older adults. These conditions pose severe morbidity, long-term disability, and mortality, with relevant socioeconomic implications. While in the research arena, the discussion remains on whether dementia is the cause or the consequence of fragility fractures, healthcare professionals need a better understanding of the interplay between such conditions from epidemiological and physiological standpoints. With this review, we summarized the available literature surrounding the relationship between cognitive impairment, dementia, and both low bone mineral density (BMD) and fragility fractures. Given the strength of the bi-directional associations and their impact on the quality of life, we shed light on the biological connections between brain and bone systems, presenting the main mediators, including gut microbioma, and pathological pathways leading to the dysregulation of bone and brain metabolism. Ultimately, we synthesized the evidence about the impact of available pharmacological treatments for the prevention of fragility fractures on cognitive functions and individuals' outcomes when dementia coexists. Vice versa, the effects of symptomatic treatments for dementia on the risk of falls and fragility fractures are explored. Combining evidence alongside clinical practice, we discuss challenges and opportunities related to the management of older adults affected by cognitive impairment or dementia and at high risk for fragility fracture prevention, which leads to not only an improvement in patient health-related outcomes and survival but also a reduction in healthcare cost and socio-economic burden.",

    "abstract": "Ageism refers to prejudice, stereotypes or discrimination based on a person's actual or perceived chronological age. While ageism can affect people at all stages of the human lifespan, ageism against older adults has emerged as the most pervasive and potentially harmful. Much is now understood about how ageism can impact older people's health and wellbeing via structural, organisational, and provider level biases that threaten the provision of equitable and ethical healthcare. Negative attitudes about age and ageing also contribute to workforce shortages in aged care sectors, such as residential aged care and nursing. However, often underappreciated is how self-directed ageism, which refers to ageism turned against oneself, can also be an important determinant of health and wellbeing. Relative to external sources of ageism, negative internalised ageist beliefs are not only experienced more frequently in older adults' everyday lives, but are also more strongly linked to their health and wellbeing. Here we highlight how this understanding means that eliminating ageism requires a multifaceted approach that targets not only health care systems and aged care professionals, but older people themselves. Because normal age-related cognitive changes in how we think, perceive and reason increase the risk of older people viewing themselves through a negative and ageist lens, we provide a novel discussion of how broader insights from cognitive ageing literature must play a central role in any agenda focused on breaking the links between ageism and health.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a gradual and irreversible natural process. With aging, the body experiences a functional decline, and the effects amplify the vulnerability to a range of age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. Within the aging process, the morphology and function of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergo alterations, particularly in the structure connecting these organelles known as mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). MAMs serve as vital intracellular signaling hubs, facilitating communication between the ER and mitochondria when regulating various cellular events, including calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and apoptosis. The formation of MAMs is partly dependent on the interaction between the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-B (VAPB) and protein tyrosine phosphatase-interacting protein-51 (PTPIP51). Accumulating evidence has begun to elucidate the pivotal role of the VAPB-PTPIP51 tether in the initiation and progression of age-related diseases. In this study, we delineate the intricate structure and multifunctional role of the VAPB-PTPIP51 tether and discuss its profound implications in aging-associated diseases. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive overview of potential therapeutic interventions and pharmacological agents targeting the VAPB-PTPIP51-mediated MAMs, thereby offering a glimmer of hope in mitigating aging processes and treating age-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of somatic mutations is a driver of cancer and has long been associated with ageing. Due to limitations in quantifying mutation burden with age in non-cancerous tissues, the impact of somatic mutations in other ageing phenotypes is unclear. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed the large-scale quantification of somatic mutations in ageing tissues. These studies have revealed a gradual accumulation of mutations in most normal tissues with age as well as a substantial clonal expansion driven mostly by cancer-related mutations. Nevertheless, it is difficult to envision how the burden and stochastic nature of age-related somatic mutations identified so far can explain most ageing phenotypes that develop gradually. Studies across species have also found that longer-lived species have lower somatic mutation rates, though these could be due to selective pressures acting on other phenotypes such as perhaps cancer. Recent studies in patients with higher somatic mutation burden and no signs of accelerated ageing further question the role of somatic mutations in ageing. Overall, with a few exceptions like cancer, recent DNA sequencing studies and inherited mutations do not support the idea that somatic mutations accumulating with age drive ageing phenotypes, and the phenotypic role, if any, of somatic mutations in ageing remains unclear.",

Within the variety of the human body, different cells store, utilize and release lipids in different ways, depending on their intrinsic function. However, these differences are not well characterized and, especially in the context of ageing, represent a key factor for cardiometabolic diseases. Whole body lipid homeostasis is a central interest in the field of cardiometabolic diseases. In this review we characterize lipid droplets and their utilization via autophagy and describe their diverse fate in three cells types central in cardiometabolic dysfunctions: adipocytes, hepatocytes, and macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) with radiotracers that bind to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) enables quantification of synaptic density in the living human brain. Assessing the regional distribution and severity of synaptic density loss will contribute to our understanding of the pathological processes that precede atrophy in neurodegeneration. In this systematic review, we provide a discussion of in vivo SV2A PET imaging research for quantitative assessment of synaptic density in various dementia conditions: amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Progressive supranuclear palsy and Corticobasal degeneration, Parkinson’s disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies, Huntington’s disease, and Spinocerebellar Ataxia. We discuss the main findings concerning group differences and clinical-cognitive correlations, and explore relations between SV2A PET and other markers of pathology. Additionally, we touch upon synaptic density in healthy ageing and outcomes of radiotracer validation studies. Studies were identified on PubMed and Embase between 2018 and 2023; last searched on the 3rd of July 2023. A total of 36 studies were included, comprising 5 on normal ageing, 21 clinical studies, and 10 validation studies. Extracted study characteristics were participant details, methodological aspects, and critical findings. In summary, the small but growing literature on in vivo SV2A PET has revealed different spatial patterns of synaptic density loss among various neurodegenerative disorders that correlate with cognitive functioning, supporting the potential role of SV2A PET imaging for differential diagnosis. SV2A PET imaging shows tremendous capability to provide novel insights into the aetiology of neurodegenerative disorders and great promise as a biomarker for synaptic density reduction. Novel directions for future synaptic density research are proposed, including (a) longitudinal imaging in larger patient cohorts of preclinical dementias, (b) multi-modal mapping of synaptic density loss onto other pathological processes, and (c) monitoring therapeutic responses and assessing drug efficacy in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Wellbeing—defined broadly as experiencing one's life as enjoyable and fulfilling—has been associated with lower risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The mechanisms underlying this association are largely unknown. However, prior research and theory suggest that wellbeing impacts health behaviors and biological systems that are relevant to cognitive and brain health. Several of these factors have also been identified by the 2020 Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care as modifiable dementia risk factors. In the current review, we summarize and evaluate the evidence for associations between wellbeing and each of the 12 Lancet Commission risk factors. We found relatively consistent evidence for associations between higher wellbeing and lower levels of most of the risk factors: physical inactivity, social isolation, smoking, depression, hypertension, diabetes, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, and air pollution. By contrast, we found evidence for only modest associations between wellbeing and education and mixed evidence for associations of wellbeing with alcohol use and body weight. Although most of the reviewed evidence was observational, longitudinal and experimental evidence suggests that many of the observed associations are likely bidirectional. These findings suggest that modifiable dementia risk factors may be mediators (i.e., intermediate steps in the causal chain) and/or confounders (i.e., variables that impact both wellbeing and dementia, and thus could induce a spurious association) of the association between wellbeing and dementia. We conclude by discussing next steps to test mediation hypotheses and to account for potential confounding in the relation between wellbeing and dementia.",

As discussed in this review, ALS patients exhibit a sex bias pertaining to the features of the disease, and their clinical, pathological, (and pathophysiological) phenotypes. Several epidemiological studies have indicated that this sex disparity stems from various aetiologies, including sex-specific brain structure and neural functioning, genetic predisposition, age, gonadal hormones, susceptibility to traumatic brain injury (TBI)/head trauma and lifestyle factors.",

To support evidence-based efforts for promoting healthy ageing, a summary of data availabilities and gaps to study ageing is needed. Through a multifaceted search strategy, we identified relevant cohort studies worldwide to studying ageing and provided a summary of available pertinent measurements. Following the World Health Organization's definition of healthy ageing, we extracted information on intrinsic capacity domains and sociodemographic, social, and environmental factors. We identified 287 cohort studies. South America, the Middle East, and Africa had a limited number of cohort studies to study ageing compared to Europe, Oceania, Asia, and North America. Data availabilities of different measures varied substantially by location and study aim. Using the information collected, we developed a web-based Healthy Ageing Toolkit to facilitate healthy ageing research. The comprehensive summary of data availability enables timely evidence to contribute to the United Nations Decades of Healthy Ageing goals of promoting healthy ageing for all. Highlighted gaps guide strategies for increased data collection in regions with limited cohort studies. Comprehensive data, encompassing intrinsic capacity and various sociodemographic, social, and environmental factors, is crucial for advancing our understanding of healthy ageing and its underlying pathways.",

The transactivation response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) plays a critical role as an RNA/DNA-binding protein in RNA metabolism and synaptic function. Accumulation of TDP-43 aggregates in the central nervous system is a hallmark of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Autophagy, a major and highly conserved degradation pathway, holds the potential for degrading aggregated TDP-43 and alleviating FTLD/ALS. This review explores the causes of TDP-43 aggregation, FTLD/ALS-related genes, key autophagy factors, and autophagy-based therapeutic strategies targeting TDP-43 proteinopathy.

    "abstract": "Dementia is a global health concern with increasing numbers of people living long enough to develop dementia. People with dementia (PwD) may be particularly vulnerable to suicidality. However, suicide in PwD has not been thoroughly explored. The objective of this review was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of suicide in PwD. Five databases were searched from inception to July 2023. Peer-reviewed publications reporting prevalence, risk factors or quantitative summary data for suicide outcomes in PwD were included. Random effects models were used to calculate the pooled prevalence and effect sizes. 54 studies met inclusion criteria. In PwD, the point prevalence of suicidal ideation was 10 % (95 %CI=6 %;16 %), 2-year period prevalence of suicide attempts was 0.8 % (95 %CI=0.3 %;2 %), 10-year period prevalence of suicide attempts was 8.7 % (95 %CI=6.0 %%;12.7 %) and the incidence of death by suicide 0.1 % (95 %CI=0.1 %;0.2 %). Compared to not having dementia, a diagnosis of dementia increased risk of suicidal ideation (OR=1.62[95 %CI=1.17;2.24]) but not risk of suicide attempt (OR=1.77 [95 %CI=0.85;3.69]) or death by suicide (OR=1.30 [95 %CI=0.81;2.10]). People with moderate dementia had significantly increased risk of suicidal ideation than those with mild dementia (OR=1.59[95 %CI=1.11;2.28]), younger PwD were at increased risk of dying by suicide (OR=2.82[95 %CI=2.16;3.68]) and men with dementia were more likely to attempt (OR=1.28[95 %CI=1.25;1.31]) and die by suicide (OR=2.88[95 %CI=1.54;5.39]) than women with dementia. This review emphasises the need for mental health support and suicide prevention in dementia care, emphasising tailored approaches based on age, symptoms, and being male.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still an excessively complicated neurological disorder that impacts millions of individuals globally. The ideal defensive feature of the central nervous system (CNS) is the intimate junction of endothelial cells, which functions as a biological barrier to safely control molecular transport throughout the brain. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) comprises tightly locked astrocyte cell junctions on CNS blood capillaries. This biological barrier shields the brain from hazardous toxins by preventing the entry of polar medications, cells, and ions. However, it is very challenging to provide any treatment to the brain for neurodegenerative illnesses like Alzheimer's. Different causative mechanisms, such as amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, tubulin-associated unit (Tau) tangles, and neuroinflammation, cause neuronal dysfunction, leading to dementia and memory loss in the subject. Several treatments are approved for AD therapy, whereas most only help treat related symptoms. Disappointingly, current remedies have not been able to control the progression of AD due to associated side effects. Specific pathogenic mechanisms are involved in the initiation and development of this disease. Therefore, the expected survival of a patient with AD is limited and is approximately ten years. Hence, the pathogenic mechanism behind AD progression must be understood to better comprehend and improve the overall survival rate. This review highlighted the recent insights into AD pathogenesis, molecular mechanisms, advancements in theragnostic techniques, the existing updates of clinical trials, and emerging innovations for AD medicinal development. That has helped researchers develop other strategies to address the shortcomings of traditional medications.",

    "abstract": "Immunosenescence is thought to result from cellular aging and to reflect exposure to environmental stressors and antigens, including cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, not all of the features of immunosenescence are consistent with this view, and this has led to the emergence of the sister theory of \"inflammaging\". The recently discovered diffuse tissue distribution of resident memory T cells (TRM) which don't recirculate, calls these theories into question. These cells account for most T cells residing in barrier epithelia which sit in and travel through the extracellular matrix (ECM). With almost all studies to date carried out on peripheral blood, the age-related changes of the ECM and their consequences for T cell mobility, which is crucial for the function of these cells, have been largely ignored. We propose an update of the theoretical framework of immunosenescence, based on a novel hypothesis: the increasing stiffness and cross-linking of the senescent ECM lead to a progressive immunodeficiency due to an age-related decrease in T cell mobility and eventually the death of these cells. A key element of this mechanism is the mechanical stress to which the cell cytoplasm and nucleus are subjected during passage through the ECM. This hypothesis is based on an \"evo-devo\" perspective bringing together some major characteristics of aging, to create a single interpretive framework for immunosenescence.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes contain a large number of transposable elements, part of which are still active and able to transpose in the host genome. Mobile element activation is repressed to avoid deleterious effects, such as gene mutations or chromosome rearrangements. Control of transposable elements includes a variety of mechanisms comprising silencing pathways, which are based on the production of small non-coding RNAs. Silencing can occur either through transposable element RNA degradation or through the targeting of DNA sequences by heterochromatin formation and consequent transcriptional inhibition. Since the important role of the heterochromatin silencing, the gradual loss of heterochromatin marks in constitutive heterochromatin regions during the aging process promotes derepression of transposable elements, which is considered a cause of the progressive increase in genomic instability and of the activation of inflammatory responses. This review provides an overview of the effects of heterochromatin loss on the activity of transposable elements during the aging process and the possible impact on genome function. In this context, we discuss the possible role of the nuclear lamina, a major player in heterochromatin dynamics, in the regulation of transposable element activity and potential implications in laminopathic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although ageing research increasingly incorporates resilience, a common notion on what resilience means is lacking. We aimed to give a comprehensive overview of the conceptual literature on resilience in older persons, identifying areas of consensus and variation/debate. A systematic search of eight databases from different disciplines led to the inclusion of 36 texts. Across the conceptual literature of resilience in older persons, three common features of descriptions of resilience were identified: a stressor, a response and a mechanism. Based on differences in their interpretation of how resilience is expressed we distinguished two perspectives. The first, classical and most widely applied perspective, describes the expression of resilience as a positive response to a high intensity stressor. The second, newer perspective, describes resilience in the context of responses relative to equilibrium, following low intensity stressors. Almost all descriptions across the two perspectives describe the resilience mechanism to be dynamic and emphasize the importance of the context in achieving resilience. This review provides clarity on the current conceptual status of resilience in older persons, an important step towards a higher level of consistency in the future use of resilience in ageing.",

    "abstract": "A widely appreciated conclusion from evolutionary theory is that senescence (aging) is of no adaptive value to the individual that it afflicts. Yet studies of Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are increasingly revealing the presence of processes which actively cause senescence and death, leading some biogerontologists to wonder about the established theory. Here we argue that programmed death that increases fitness could occur in C. elegans and S. cerevisiae, and that this is consistent with the classic evolutionary theory of aging. This is because of the special conditions under which these organisms have evolved, particularly the existence of clonal populations with limited dispersal and, in the case of C. elegans, the brevity of the reproductive period caused by protandrous hermaphroditism. Under these conditions, death-promoting mechanisms could promote worm fitness by enhancing inclusive fitness, or worm colony fitness through group selection. Such altruistic, adaptive death is not expected to evolve in organisms with outbred, dispersed populations (e.g. most vertebrate species). The plausibility of adaptive death in C. elegans is supported by computer modelling studies, and new knowledge about the ecology of this species. To support these arguments we also review the biology of adaptive death, and distinguish three forms: consumer sacrifice, biomass sacrifice and defensive sacrifice.",

    "abstract": "An appraisal of recent data highlighting aspects inspired by the new Geroscience perspective are here discussed. The main findings are summarized as follows: i) liver has to be considered an immunological organ, and new studies suggest a role for the recently described cells named telocytes; ii) the liver-gut axis represents a crucial connection with environment and life style habits and may influence liver diseases onset; iii) the physiological aging of liver shows relatively modest alterations. Nevertheless, several molecular changes appear to be relevant: a) an increase of microRNA-31-5p; -141-3p; -200c-3p expressions after 60 years of age; b) a remodeling of genome-wide DNA methylation profile evident until 60 years of age and then plateauing; c) changes in transcriptome including the metabolic zones of hepatocyte lobules; d) liver undergoes an accelerated aging in presence of chronic inflammation/liver diseases in a sort of continuum, largely as a consequence of unhealthy life styles and exposure to environmental noxious agents. We argue that chronic liver inflammation has all the major characteristics of \"inflammaging\" and likely sustains the onset and progression of liver diseases. Finally, we propose to use a combination of parameters, mostly obtained by omics such as transcriptomics and epigenomics, to evaluate in deep both the biological age of liver (in comparison with the chronological age) and the effects of donor-recipient age-mismatches in the context of liver transplant.",

    "abstract": "Most proteins undergo posttranslational modification such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, biotinylation, and ubiquitination to regulate various cellular processes. Ubiquitin-targeted proteins from the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are degraded by 26S proteasome, along with this, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have specific activity against the UPS through detaching of ubiquitin on ubiquitin-targeted proteins. Balancing between protein expression and degradation through interplay between the UPS and DUBs is important to maintain cell homeostasis, and abnormal expression and elongation of proteins lead to diverse diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune response. Therefore, development of DUB inhibitors as therapeutic targets has been challenging. In addition, understanding of the roles of DUBs in neurodegeneration, specifically brain diseases, has emerged gradually. This review highlights recent studies on the molecular mechanisms for DUBs, and discusses potential therapeutic targets for DUBs in cases of brain diseases.",

    "abstract": "Corpora amylacea (CA) have been described in several human organs and have been associated with ageing and several pathological conditions. Although they were first discovered two centuries ago, their function and significance have not yet been identified. Here, we provide a chronological summary of the findings on CA in various organs and identify their similarities. After collecting and integrating these findings, we propose to consider CA as waste containers created by specific cells, which sequester waste products and foreign products, and assemble them within a glycan structure. The containers are then secreted into the external medium or interstitial spaces, in this latter case subsequently being phagocytosed by macrophages. This proposal explains, among others, why CA are so varied in content, why only some of them contain fibrillary amyloid proteins, why all of them contain glycan structures, why some of them contain neo-epitopes and are phagocytosed, and why they can be intracellular or extracellular structures. Lastly, in order to avoid the ambiguity of the term amyloid (which can indicate starch-like structures but also insoluble fibrillary proteins), we propose renaming CA as \"wasteosomes\", emphasising the waste products they entrap rather than their misleading amyloid properties.",

A growing body of evidence indicates that alterations in multiple components of endocytic pathways contribute to cellular senescence. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CavME) represent major types of endocytosis that are implicated in senescence. More recent research has also identified a chromatin modifier and tumor suppressor that contributes to the induction of senescence via altered endocytosis. Here, molecular regulators of aberrant endocytosis-induced senescence are reviewed and discussed in the context of their capacity to serve as senescence-inducing stressors or modifiers.",

In cross-sectional studies' analyses, the pooled weighted mean difference for total brain volume (TBV) and gray matter volume (GMV) in obese/overweight participants was -11.59 (95 % CI: -23.17 to -0.02) and -10.98 (95 % CI: -20.78 to -1.18), respectively. TBV was adversely associated with BMI and WC, GMV with BMI, and hippocampal volume with BMI, WC, and WHR. WC/WHR are associated with a risk of lacunar and white matter hyperintensity (WMH). In longitudinal studies' analyses, BMI was not statistically associated with the overall structural brain abnormalities (for continuous BMI: RR = 1.02, 95 % CI: 0.94-1.12; for categorial BMI: RR = 1.18, 95 % CI: 0.75-1.85). Small sample size of prospective longitudinal studies limited the power of its pooled estimates. A higher BMI is associated with lower brain volume while greater WC/WHR, but not BMI, is related to a risk of lacunar infarct and WMH. Future longitudinal research is needed to further elucidate the specific causal relationships and explore preventive measures.",

Cardiometabolic risk factors including diabetes, mid-life obesity, mid-life hypertension and elevated cholesterol have been linked with cognitive decline in AD subjects. These potential risk factors associated with cerebral metabolic changes which fuel AD pathogenesis have been suggested to be the reason for the disappointing clinical trial results. In appreciation of the risks involved, using search engines such as PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE and Google Scholar, a relevant literature search on cardiometabolic and genetic risk factors in AD was conducted. We discuss the role of genetic as well as established cardiovascular risk factors in the neuropathology of AD. Moreover, we show new evidence of genetic interaction between several genes potentially involved in different pathways related to both neurodegenerative process and cardiovascular damage.",

In addition, meta-analytic techniques, using mixed-effect methods, were carried out to estimate the impact (pooled effect size) of CR proxies on either dementia incidence or cognitive decline after stroke.Twenty-two studies were included in the systematic revision, whereas nineteen of them were eligible for the meta-analysis. The findings showed that high education is associated with a decreased rate of post-stroke dementia. Moreover, other CR proxies (e.g., occupation, bilingualism or social interaction) demonstrate a protective effect against non-dementia cognitive decline after stroke, although some inconsistencies were found in the literature. Regarding the meta-analysis, occupational attainment and education) showed a protective effect against post-stroke cognitive impairment diagnosis in comparison with a mixed category of different CR proxies. Second, a main cognitive change effect was found, pointing to greater cognitive change after stroke in those with low vs. high CR.Our findings emphasize that CR may prevent cognitive decline after stroke, but this effect can be modulated by different factors such the CR proxy and individual characteristics such as age or type of lesion. The methodological divergences of the studies (i.e., follow-up intervals, cognitive outcomes) need unification to diminish external sources of variability for predicting rates of cognitive decline after stroke.",

We included original research published in peer-reviewed journals including both qualitative and quantitative studies. We assessed quality of included studies using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tools. A narrative synthesis was conducted of all included studies.Of the 4827 articles screened, 34 articles met inclusion criteria. A variety of interventions were identified, with more than half taking place in a museum or gallery. Five RCTs showed improvements in wellbeing outcomes but no cognitive improvements except in some subscales in a music intervention. Most non-randomised studies reported cognitive improvements and well-being improvements for people living with dementia and their caregivers. Studies primarily focused on individuals with mild to moderate dementia.The use of arts and culture interventions may provide benefits for people living with dementia and their caregivers. However, heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measures prevented generalization of the results. Further research of arts and culture interventions for people living with dementia and their caregivers should utilize larger controlled trials, standardized outcome measures and include individuals with moderate to severe dementia.",

    "abstract": "WHO has defined intrinsic capacity (IC) as the composite of all physical and mental capacities of an individual covering five subdomains: cognition, locomotion, sensory, vitality, and psychological. Despite this well accepted definition, the conceptual and measurement model of IC remains unclear, which hampers a standardized operationalization of the construct. We performed a scoping review to give a comprehensive overview of the extent to which the current literature of IC addresses and assumes the conceptual framework and measurement model of IC as reflective or formative. For inclusion, we considered all types of articles that were published in peer-reviewed journals except for protocol articles. A systematic search of 6 databases from different disciplines led to the inclusion of 31 papers. We found inconsistency and gaps in the descriptions of IC. Most of the papers did not define the measurement model. In the conceptual background and validation articles, we identified descriptions of both reflective and formative measurement models while in empirical studies applying IC measurements the underlying assumptions remained mainly unclear. Defining a measurement model is not merely a theoretical matter but influences the operationalization and validation processes of the construct. This study raised questions about the most fundamental features of the IC construct and discusses whether IC should be considered as an underlying latent trait of all capacities (reflective construct) or an aggregate summary measure of the subdomain capacities (formative construct).",

Studies of AD patients and AD transgenic mice have revealed alterations in the retina similar to alterations which occur in the AD brain. Moreover, AD retinal pathology occurs even earlier than AD brain pathology. Importantly, non-invasive imaging techniques can be utilized for retinal observation due to the unique optical transparency of the eye, which acts as a convenient window in which preclinical pathology in the AD brain can be monitored. In this review, we overview the existing literature covering different forms of AD retinal pathology and propose a basis for the clinical application of using the retina as a window to view AD during preclinical and clinical stages.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence has shown that people with chronic low back pain (CLBP) demonstrate significantly greater declines in multiple cognitive domains than people who do not have CLBP. Given the high prevalence of CLBP in the ever-growing aging population that may be more vulnerable to cognitive decline, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the accelerated cognitive decline observed in this population, so that proper preventive or treatment approaches can be developed and implemented. The current scoping review summarizes what is known regarding the potential mechanisms underlying suboptimal cognitive performance and cognitive decline in people with CLBP and discusses future research directions. Five potential mechanisms were identified based on the findings from 34 included studies: (1) altered activity in the cortex and neural networks; (2) grey matter atrophy; (3) microglial activation and neuroinflammation; (4) comorbidities associated with CLBP; and (5) gut microbiota dysbiosis. Future studies should deepen the understanding of mechanisms underlying this association so that proper prevention and treatment strategies can be developed.",

Unraveling the underlying molecular mechanisms and developing effective treatments are crucial for improving the quality of life for those affected. In this context, accelerated aging models offer valuable insights into these conditions by displaying the hallmarks of human aging. Herein, this review focuses on relevant mouse models of musculoskeletal aging with particular emphasis on frailty, osteoporosis, and sarcopenia. Among the discussed models, PolgA mice in particular exhibit hallmarks of musculoskeletal aging, presenting early-onset frailty, as well as reduced bone and muscle mass that closely resemble human musculoskeletal aging. Ultimately, findings from these models hold promise for advancing interventions targeted at age-related musculoskeletal disorders, effectively addressing the challenges posed by musculoskeletal aging and associated conditions in humans.",

    "abstract": "Vascular ageing, characterized by structural and functional changes in blood vessels of which arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction are key components, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and other age-related diseases. As the global population continues to age, understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate vascular ageing becomes crucial for improving cardiovascular health outcomes. Therefore, this review provides an overview of the current knowledge on pharmacological modulation of vascular ageing, highlighting key strategies and promising therapeutic targets. Several molecular pathways have been identified as central players in vascular ageing, including oxidative stress and inflammation, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, cellular senescence, macroautophagy, extracellular matrix remodelling, calcification, and gasotransmitter-related signalling. Pharmacological and dietary interventions targeting these pathways have shown potential in ameliorating age-related vascular changes. Nevertheless, the development and application of drugs targeting vascular ageing is complicated by various inherent challenges and limitations, such as certain preclinical methodological considerations, interactions with exercise training and sex/gender-related differences, which should be taken into account. Overall, pharmacological modulation of endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness as hallmarks of vascular ageing, holds great promise for improving cardiovascular health in the ageing population. Nonetheless, further research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and optimize the efficacy and safety of these interventions for clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Here we propose that SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a class of drugs primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes, could also be repositioned as anti-aging senomorphic drugs (agents that prevent the extrinsic harmful effects of senescent cells). As observed for metformin, another anti-diabetic drug with established anti-aging potential, increasing evidence suggests that SGLT2i can modulate some relevant pathways associated with the aging process, such as free radical production, cellular energy regulation through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), autophagy, and the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB/inflammasome. Some interesting pro-healthy effects were also observed on human microbiota. All these mechanisms converge on fueling a systemic proinflammatory condition called inflammaging, now recognized as the main risk factor for accelerated aging and increased risk of age-related disease development and progression. Inflammaging can be worsened by cellular senescence and immunosenescence, which contributes to the increased burden of senescent cells during aging, perpetuating the proinflammatory condition. Interestingly, increasing evidence suggested the direct effects of SGLT-2i against senescent cells, chronic activation of immune cells, and metabolic alterations induced by overnutrition (meta-inflammation). In this framework, we analyzed and discussed the multifaceted impact of SGLT2i, compared with metformin effects, as a potential anti-aging drug beyond diabetes management. Despite promising results in experimental studies, rigorous investigations with well-designed cellular and clinical investigations will need to validate SGLT2 inhibitors' anti-aging effects.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks control the internal sleep-wake rhythmicity of 24 h which is synchronized by the solar cycle. Circadian regulation of metabolism evolved about 2.5 billion years ago, i.e., the rhythmicity has been conserved from cyanobacteria and Archaea through to mammals although the mechanisms utilized have developed with evolution. While the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an evolutionarily conserved defence mechanism against environmental threats, it has gained many novel functions during evolution, such as the regulation of cell cycle, proteostasis, and many immune functions. There is robust evidence that AhR signaling impairs circadian rhythmicity, e.g., by interacting with the core BMAL1/CLOCK complex and disturbing the epigenetic regulation of clock genes. The maintenance of circadian rhythms is impaired with aging, disturbing metabolism and many important functions in aged organisms. Interestingly, it is known that AhR signaling promotes an age-related tissue degeneration, e.g., it is able to inhibit autophagy, enhance cellular senescence, and disrupt extracellular matrix. These alterations are rather similar to those induced by a long-term impairment of circadian rhythms. However, it is not known whether AhR signaling enhances the aging process by impairing circadian homeostasis. I will examine the experimental evidence indicating that AhR signaling is able to promote the age-related degeneration via a disruption of circadian rhythmicity.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuits, such as synaptic plasticity and neural activity, are critical components of healthy brain function. The consequent dynamic remodeling of neural circuits is an ongoing procedure affecting neuronal activities. Disruption of this essential process results in diseases. Advanced microscopic applications such as two-photon laser scanning microscopy have recently been applied to understand neural circuit changes during disease since it can visualize fine structural and functional cellular activation in living animals. In this review, we have summarized the latest work assessing the dynamic rewiring of postsynaptic dendritic spines and modulation of calcium transients in neurons of the intact living brain, focusing on their potential roles in neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and epilepsy). Understanding the fine changes that occurred in the brain during disease is crucial for future clinical intervention developments.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to evaluate previous studies which used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in dementia given its suitability as a diagnostic and investigative tool in this population. From 800 identified records which used NIRS in dementia and prodromal stages, 88 studies were evaluated which employed a range of tasks testing memory (29), word retrieval (24), motor (8) and visuo-spatial function (4), and which explored the resting state (32). Across these domains, dementia exhibited blunted haemodynamic responses, often localised to frontal regions of interest, and a lack of task-appropriate frontal lateralisation. Prodromal stages, such as mild cognitive impairment, revealed mixed results. Reduced cognitive performance accompanied by either diminished functional responses or hyperactivity was identified, the latter suggesting a compensatory response not present at the dementia stage. Despite clear evidence of alterations in brain oxygenation in dementia and prodromal stages, a consensus as to the nature of these changes is difficult to reach. This is likely partially due to the lack of standardisation in optical techniques and processing methods for the application of NIRS to dementia. Further studies are required for exploring more naturalistic settings and in a wider range of dementia subtypes.",

These transformations will exacerbate pollution, thus highlighting the necessity to unravel its effect on human health. Epidemiological studies have reported that pollution increases the risk of neurological diseases, with growing evidence on the risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Air pollution and water pollutants are the main chemicals driving this risk. These chemicals can promote inflammation, acting in synergy with genotype vulnerability. However, the biological underpinnings of this association are unknown. In this review, we focus on the link between pollution and brain network connectivity at the macro-scale level. We provide an updated overview of epidemiological findings and studies investigating brain network changes associated with pollution exposure, and discuss the mechanistic insights of pollution-induced brain changes through neural networks. We explain, in detail, the pollutome-connectome axis that might provide the functional substrate for pollution-induced processes leading to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. We describe this model within the framework of two pollutants, air pollution, a widely recognized threat, and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a large class of synthetic chemicals which are currently emerging as new neurotoxic source.",

This systematic review included 44 randomised controlled trials (RCT) (29 RCT surgical, 15 RCT medical patients) examining the effect of ONS in community settings on the incidence of complications (n = 716, mean age 67 years, range 35-87). ONS (mean intake 588 kcal/day, range 125-1750; protein 22 g/day, range 0-54; mean energy from protein 22 %, range 0-54) were prescribed for a mean 74 days, range 5-365. Most RCT (77 %) reported fewer complications in the ONS group versus control. Meta-analysis (39 RCT) showed ONS consumption reduced complications including infections, pressure ulcers, wound and fracture healing (OR 0.68, 95 % CI 0.59,0.79; p<0.001). Results showed reductions when ONS were used in hospital and community settings (OR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.59,0.87; p = 0.001) or just in the community (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.52, 0.80; p<0.001). Reductions in complications were only seen with high ONS adherence ≥ 80 % (OR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.48,0.83; p = 0.001) and ready-to-drink ONS (OR 0.69, 95 % CI 0.60,0.81; p<0.001). This systematic review and meta-analysis show community-based use of ONS in addition to the diet substantially reduces the incidence of complications. The diversity of ONS, patient populations and complication outcomes within the trials included in this review mean further research is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Depression and Alzheimer´s disease (AD) are two disorders highly prevalent worldwide. Depression affects more than 300 million people worldwide while AD affects 60% to 80% of the 55 million cases of dementia. Both diseases are affected by aging with high prevalence in elderly and share not only the main brain affected areas but also several physiopathological mechanisms. Depression disease is already ascribed as a risk factor to the development of AD. Despite the wide diversity of pharmacological treatments currently available in clinical practice for depression management, they remain associated to a slow recovery process and to treatment-resistant depression. On the other hand, AD treatment is essentially based in symptomatology relieve. Thus, the need for new multi-target treatments arises. Herein, we discuss the current state-of-art regarding the contribution of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in synaptic transmission processes, synapses plasticity and neurogenesis and consequently the use of exogenous cannabinoids in the treatment of depression and on delaying the progression of AD. Besides the well-known imbalance of neurotransmitter levels, including serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine and glutamate, recent scientific evidence highlights aberrant spine density, neuroinflammation, dysregulation of neurotrophic factor levels and formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, as the main physiopathological mechanisms compromised in depression and AD. The contribution of the ECS in these mechanisms is herein specified as well as the pleiotropic effects of phytocannabinoids. At the end, it became evident that Cannabinol, Cannabidiol, Cannabigerol, Cannabidivarin and Cannabichromene may act in novel therapeutic targets, presenting high potential in the pharmacotherapy of both diseases.",

    "abstract": "The thymus is a critical immune organ with endocrine and immune functions that plays important roles in the physiological and pathological processes of the body. However, with aging, the thymus undergoes degenerative changes leading to decreased production and output of naive T cells and the secretion of thymic hormones and related cytokines, thereby promoting the occurrence and development of various age-associated diseases. Therefore, identifying essential processes that regulate age-associated thymic involution is crucial for long-term control of thymic involution and age-associated disease progression. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a well-established process involved in organ aging and functional impairment through tissue fibrosis in several organs, such as the heart and kidney. In the thymus, EMT promotes fibrosis and potentially adipogenesis, leading to thymic involution. This review focuses on the factors involved in thymic involution, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and hormones, from the perspective of EMT. Furthermore, current interventions for reversing age-associated thymic involution by targeting EMT-associated processes are summarized. Understanding the key mechanisms of thymic involution through EMT as an entry point may promote the development of new therapies and clinical agents to reverse thymic involution and age-associated disease.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a pathophysiological process that causes a gradual and permanent reduction in all biological system functions. The phenomenon is caused by the accumulation of endogenous and exogenous damage as a result of several stressors, resulting in significantly increased risks of various age-related diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and immune system diseases. In addition, aging appears to be connected with mis-regulation of programmed cell death (PCD), which is required for regular cell turnover in many tissues sustained by cell division. According to the recent nomenclature, PCDs are physiological forms of regulated cell death (RCD) useful for normal tissue development and turnover. To some extent, some cell types are connected with a decrease in RCD throughout aging, whereas others are related with an increase in RCD. Perhaps the widespread decline in RCD markers with age is due to a slowdown of the normal rate of homeostatic cell turnover in various adult tissues. As a result, proper RCD regulation requires a careful balance of many pro-RCD and anti-RCD components, which may render cell death signaling pathways more sensitive to maladaptive signals during aging. Current research, on the other hand, tries to further dive into the pathophysiology of aging in order to develop therapies that improve health and longevity. In this scenario, RCD handling might be a helpful strategy for human health since it could reduce the occurrence and development of age-related disorders, promoting healthy aging and lifespan. In this review we propose a general overview of the most recent RCD mechanisms and their connection with the pathophysiology of aging in order to promote targeted therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Delirium is a common condition across different settings and populations. The interventions for preventing and managing this condition are still poorly known. The aim of this umbrella review is to synthesize and grade all preventative and therapeutic interventions for delirium. We searched five databases from database inception up to March 15th, 2023 and we included meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to decrease the risk of/the severity of delirium. From 1959 records after deduplication, we included 59 systematic reviews with meta-analyses, providing 110 meta-analytic estimates across populations, interventions, outcomes, settings, and age groups (485 unique RCTs, 172,045 participants). In surgery setting, for preventing delirium, high GRADE evidence supported dexmedetomidine (RR=0.53; 95%CI: 0.46-0.67, k=13, N=3988) and comprehensive geriatric assessment (OR=0.46; 95%CI=0.32-0.67, k=3, N=496) in older adults, dexmedetomidine in adults (RR=0.33, 95%CI=0.24-0.45, k=7, N=1974), A2-adrenergic agonists after induction of anesthesia (OR= 0.28, 95%CI= 0.19-0.40, k=10, N=669) in children. High certainty evidence did not support melatonergic agents in older adults for delirium prevention. Moderate certainty supported the effect of dexmedetomidine in adults and children (k=4), various non-pharmacological interventions in adults and older people (k=4), second-generation antipsychotics in adults and mixed age groups (k=3), EEG-guided anesthesia in adults (k=2), mixed pharmacological interventions (k=1), five other specific pharmacological interventions in children (k=1 each). In conclusion, our work indicates that effective treatments to prevent delirium differ across populations, settings, and age groups. Results inform future guidelines to prevent or treat delirium, accounting for safety and costs of interventions. More research is needed in non-surgical settings.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease with multiple causative factors such as aging, mechanical injury, and obesity. Autophagy is a complex dynamic process that is involved in the degradation and modification of intracellular proteins and organelles under different pathophysiological conditions. Autophagy, as a cell survival mechanism under various stress conditions, plays a key role in regulating chondrocyte life cycle metabolism and cellular homeostasis. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are heterogeneous transcripts that do not possess protein-coding functions, but they can act as effective post-transcriptional and epigenetic regulators of gene and protein expression, thus participating in numerous fundamental biological processes. Increasing evidence suggests that ncRNAs, autophagy, and their crosstalk play crucial roles in OA pathogenesis. Therefore, we summarized the complex role of autophagy in OA chondrocytes and focused on the regulatory role of ncRNAs in OA-associated autophagy to elucidate the complex pathological mechanisms of the ncRNA-autophagy network in the development of OA, thus providing new research targets for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of OA.",

    "abstract": "Brain diseases present a significant obstacle to both global health and economic progress, owing to their elusive pathogenesis and the limited effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions. Phototherapy has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic modality for addressing age-related brain disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), among others. This review examines the recent progressions in phototherapeutic interventions. Firstly, the article elucidates the various wavelengths of visible light that possess the capability to penetrate the skin and skull, as well as the pathways of light stimulation, encompassing the eyes, skin, veins, and skull. Secondly, it deliberates on the molecular mechanisms of visible light on photosensitive proteins, within the context of brain disorders and other molecular pathways of light modulation. Lastly, the practical application of phototherapy in diverse clinical neurological disorders is indicated. Additionally, this review presents novel approaches that combine phototherapy and pharmacological interventions. Moreover, it outlines the limitations of phototherapeutics and proposes innovative strategies to improve the treatment of cerebral disorders.",

To date, the available neuroimaging literature lacks conclusive evidence about neural patterns underlying EF deficits in PD. Here, we aimed to synthesize the results of PET/fMRI studies examining the differences in brain activation between PD patients and controls during EF tasks, focussing on the three main EF sub-components: cognitive flexibility, working memory, and response inhibition. We conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis to assess the converging alterations in brain activity in PD patients compared to controls. We assessed the association between aberrant patterns of activity and the EF sub-domains. We found a significant association between hypoactivation patterns in PD converging at the level of the right inferior frontal gyrus in response inhibition tasks, whereas hypoactivation in the left inferior frontal gyrus was found in association with the cognitive flexibility domain. Our results confirm the existence of neural alterations in PD patients in relation to specific EF sub-domains.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus, a metabolic condition affecting around 537 million individuals worldwide, poses significant challenges, particularly among the elderly population. The etiopathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) depends on a combination of the effects driven by advancing age, genetic background, and lifestyle habits, e.g. overnutrition. These factors influence the development of T2D differently in men and women, with an obvious sexual dimorphism possibly underlying the diverse clinical features of the disease in different sexes. More recently, environmental pollution, estimated to cause 9 million deaths every year, is emerging as a novel risk factor for the development of T2D. Indeed, exposure to atmospheric pollutants such as PM2.5, O3, NO2, and Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP)s, along with their combination and bioaccumulation, is associated with the development of T2D and obesity, with a 15 % excess risk in case of exposure to very high levels of PM2.5. Similar data are available for plasticizer molecules, e.g. bisphenol A and phthalates, emerging endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Even though causality is still debated at this stage, preclinical evidence sustains the ability of multiple pollutants to affect pancreatic function, promote insulin resistance, and alter lipid metabolism, possibly contributing to T2D onset and progression. In addition, preclinical findings suggest a possible role also for plastic itself in the development of T2D. Indeed, pioneeristic studies evidenced that micro- or nanoplastics (MNP)s, particles in the micro- or nano- range, promote cellular damage, senescence, inflammation, and metabolic disturbances, leading to insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism in animal and/or in vitro models. Here we synthesize recent knowledge relative to the association between air-related or plastic-derived pollutants and the incidence of T2D, discussing also the possible mechanistic links suggested by the available literature. We then anticipate the need for future studies in the field of candidate therapeutic strategies limiting pollution-induced damage in preclinical models, such as SGLT-2 inhibitors. We finally postulate that future guidelines for T2D prevention should consider pollution and sex an additional risk factors to limit the diabetes pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among elderly people. This disease imposes a significant burden on the healthcare system, society, and economy due to the increasing global aging population. Current trials with drugs or bioactive compounds aimed at reducing cerebral Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and tau protein neurofibrillary tangles, which are the two main hallmarks of this devastating neurodegenerative disease, have not provided significant results in terms of their neuropathological outcomes nor met the expected clinical end-points. Ageing, genetic and environmental risk factors, along with different clinical symptoms suggest that AD is a complex and heterogeneous disorder with multiple interconnected pathological pathways rather than a single disease entity. In the present review, we highlight and discuss various non-canonical, Aβ-independent mechanisms, like gliosis, unhealthy dietary intake, lipid and sugar signaling, and cerebrovascular damage that contribute to the onset and development of AD. We emphasize that challenging the traditional \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\" may improve our understanding of this age-related complex syndrome and help fight the progressive cognitive decline in AD.",

RNA methylation is crucial in regulating stem cell fate by modulating gene expression. This review synthesizes current research on RNA methylation modifications, such as m6A, m7G, m5C, and m1A, and their impact on adult stem cell fate. It provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular machinery involved in RNA methylation, emphasizes the critical roles of these modifications in stem cell biology, reviews the latest advancements in sequencing technologies, and discusses potential crosstalk between RNA methylation and epigenetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian organism is comprised of tissue types with varying degrees of self-renewal and regenerative capacity. In most organs self-renewing tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells contribute to organ maintenance, and it is vital to maintain a functional stem cell pool to preserve organ homeostasis. Various conditions like tissue injury, stress responses, and regeneration challenge the stem cell pool to re-establish homeostasis (Fig. 1). However, with increasing age the functionality of adult stem cells declines and genomic mutations accumulate. These defects affect different cellular response pathways and lead to impairments in regeneration, stress tolerance, and organ function as well as to an increased risk for the development of ageing associated diseases and cancer. Maintenance of the genome appears to be of utmost importance to preserve stem cell function and to reduce the risk of ageing associated dysfunctions and pathologies. In this review, we discuss the causal link between stem cell dysfunction and DNA damage accrual, different strategies how stem cells maintain genome integrity, and how these processes are affected during ageing.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative condition, is the most common cause of dementia among the elder people, but currently there is no treatment. A number of putative pathogenic events, particularly amyloid β peptide (Aβ) accumulation, are believed to be early triggers that initiate AD. However, thus far targeting Aβ generation/aggregation as the mainstay strategy of drug development has not led to effective AD-modifying therapeutics. Oxidative damage is a conspicuous feature of AD, but this remains poorly defined phenomenon and mechanistically ill understood. The TRPM2 channel has emerged as a potentially ubiquitous molecular mechanism mediating oxidative damage and thus plays a vital role in the pathogenesis and progression of diverse neurodegenerative diseases. This article will review the emerging evidence from recent studies and propose a novel 'hypothesis' that multiple TRPM2-mediated cellular and molecular mechanisms cascade Aβ and/or oxidative damage to AD pathologies. The 'hypothesis' based on these new findings discusses the prospect of considering the TRPM2 channel as a novel therapeutic target for intervening AD and age-related dementia.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by a general decline in the physiological functions of the body with the deteriorating organ systems. Brain is no exception to this and deficits in cognitive functions are quite common in advanced aging. Though a variety of age-related alterations are observed in the structure and function throughout the brain, certain regions show selective vulnerability. Medial temporal lobe, especially the hippocampus, is one such preferentially vulnerable region and is a crucial structure involved in the learning and long-term memory functions. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), are candidate cellular correlates of learning and memory and alterations in these properties have been well documented in aging. A related phenomenon called synaptic tagging and capture (STC) has been proposed as a mechanism for cellular memory consolidation and to account for temporal association of memories. Mounting evidences from behavioral settings suggest that STC could be a physiological phenomenon. In this article, we review the recent data concerning STC and provide a framework for how alterations in STC-related mechanisms could contribute to the age-associated memory impairments. The enormity of impairment in learning and memory functions demands an understanding of age-associated memory deficits at the fundamental level given its impact in the everyday tasks, thereby in the quality of life. Such an understanding is also crucial for designing interventions and preventive measures for successful brain aging.",

    "abstract": "Sedentary behaviour (SB) and physical activity (PA) can be objectively assessed with inertial sensors to describe bodily movement. Higher SB and lower PA is associated with higher chronological age and negative health outcomes. This study aimed to quantify the association between instrumented measures of SB (i-SB) and PA (i-PA) and mortality in community-dwelling older adults, to subsequently compare the quantitative effect sizes and to determine the dose-response relationships. An electronic search in six databases from inception to 27th of June 2019 was conducted. All articles reporting on i-SB or i-PA and mortality in community-dwelling older adults aged 60 years or older were considered eligible. A meta-analysis was conducted for the association between i-SB and i-PA and mortality expressed in Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI). A meta-regression analysis was performed to determine the dose-response relationship between i-SB and steps per day and mortality. Twelve prospective articles representing eleven cohorts, reporting data of 38,141 participants were included. In total 2502 (6.4%) participants died during follow-up (2.0 to 9.8 years). Comparing the most sedentary with the least sedentary groups of participants resulted in a pooled HR of 2.44 (95% CI 1.82–3.25). Comparing the least active with the most active groups of participants resulted in a pooled HR of 1.93 (95% CI 1.39-2.69); 2.66 (95% CI 2.11–3.35); 3.43 (95% CI 2.61–4.52), and 3.09 (95% CI 2.33–4.11) for light, moderate-to-vigorous-, total PA and steps per day, respectively. Meta-regression analyses showed clear dose-response relationships between i-SB and steps per day and mortality risk. Both i-SB and i-PA are significantly associated with mortality in community-dwelling older adults, showing the largest effect size for total physical activity. Dose-response relationships could be observed for i-SB and steps per day.",

This article recommends some ways in which geroscience can be augmented through collaboration with behavioral and social science to: accomplish translation from animal models to humans; inform the design of clinical trials of anti-aging therapies; develop outcome measures for evaluating efficacy of anti-aging therapies, and reduce and not exacerbate health disparities.",

    "abstract": "Neurological aging is frequently viewed as a linear process of decline, whereas in reality, it is a dynamic non-linear process. The dynamic nature of neurological aging is exemplified during midlife in the female brain. To investigate fundamental mechanisms of midlife aging that underlie risk for development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in late life, we investigated the brain at greatest risk for the disease, the aging female brain. Outcomes of our research indicate that mid-life aging in the female is characterized by the emergence of three phases: early chronological (pre-menopause), endocrinological (peri-menopause) and late chronological (post-menopause) aging. The endocrinological aging program is sandwiched between early and late chronological aging. Throughout the three stages of midlife aging, two systems of biology, metabolic and immune, are tightly integrated through a network of signaling cascades. The network of signaling between these two systems of biology underlie an orchestrated sequence of adaptative starvation responses that shift the brain from near exclusive dependence on a single fuel, glucose, to utilization of an auxiliary fuel derived from lipids, ketone bodies. The dismantling of the estrogen control of glucose metabolism during mid-life aging is a critical contributor to the shift in fuel systems and emergence of dynamic neuroimmune phenotype. The shift in fuel reliance, puts the largest reservoir of local fatty acids, white matter, at risk for catabolism as a source of lipids to generate ketone bodies through astrocytic beta oxidation. APOE4 genotype accelerates the tipping point for emergence of the bioenergetic crisis. While outcomes derived from research conducted in the female brain are not directly translatable to the male brain, the questions addressed in a female centric program of research are directly applicable to investigation of the male brain. Like females, males with AD exhibit deficits in the bioenergetic system of the brain, activation of the immune system and hallmark Alzheimer's pathologies. The drivers and trajectory of mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in the male brain will undoubtedly share common aspects with the female in addition to factors unique to the male. Preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that midlife endocrine aging can also be a transitional bridge to autoimmune disorders. Collectively, the data indicate that endocrinological aging is a critical period \"tipping point\" in midlife which can initiate emergence of the prodromal stage of late-onset-Alzheimer's disease. Interventions that target both immune and metabolic shifts that occur during midlife aging have the potential to alter the trajectory of Alzheimer's risk in late life. Further, to achieve precision medicine for AD, chromosomal sex is a critical variable to consider along with APOE genotype, other genetic risk factors and stage of disease.",

The risk for such pathologies develops years before clinical symptoms appear, and is higher in people with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) polymorphisms. Thousands of people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) are underdiagnosed. Enemy-aggregating proteins may reside in these underdiagnosed AATD patients for many years before a pathology for AATD fully develops. In this perspective review, we hypothesize that the AAT protein could exert a new and previously unconsidered biological effect as an endogenous metal ion chelator that plays a significant role in essential metal ion homeostasis. In this respect, AAT polymorphism may cause an imbalance of metal ions, which could be correlated with the aggregation of amylin, tau, amyloid beta, and alpha synuclein proteins in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively.",

The goal is to provide ideas that go beyond classical diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging or tomography, thus changing the paradigm; enabling the detection of frailty without expensive facilities, in an ecological way for both patients and medical staff and even with continuous monitoring. Fried's five-point phenotype model of frailty along with a model based on trials and several classical physical tests were used for device classification. This work provides a starting point for future researchers who will have to try to bridge the gap separating elderly people from technology and medical tests in order to provide feasible, accurate and affordable tools for frailty monitoring for a wide range of users.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence confirms that PD is indeed a multifactorial disease with different aetiologies and prodromal symptomatology that likely depend on the initial trigger. New players with important roles as triggers, facilitators and aggravators of the PD neurodegenerative process have re-emerged in the last few years, the microbes. Having evolved in association with humans for ages, microbes and their products are now seen as fundamental regulators of human physiology with disturbances in their balance being increasingly accepted to have a relevant impact on the progression of disease in general and on PD in particular. In this review, we comprehensively address early studies that have directly or indirectly linked bacteria or other infectious agents to the onset and progression of PD, from the earliest suspects to the most recent culprits, the gut microbiota. The quest for effective treatments to arrest PD progression must inevitably address the different interactions between microbiota and human cells, and naturally consider the gut-brain axis. The comprehensive characterization of such mechanisms will help design innovative bacteriotherapeutic approaches to selectively shape the gut microbiota profile ultimately to halt PD progression. The present review describes our current understanding of the role of microorganisms and their endosymbiotic relatives, the mitochondria, in inducing, facilitating, or aggravating PD pathogenesis.",

The mutant HTT (mHTT) proteins in the body interfere with HTT's normal cellular functions and cause additional detrimental effects. In this review, we discuss multiple approaches targeting DNA and RNA to reduce mHTT expression. These approaches are categorized into non-allele-specific silencing and allele-specific-silencing using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplogroup analysis. Additionally, this review discusses a potential application of recent CRISPR prime editing technology in targeting HD.",

    "abstract": "Multimorbidity disproportionally affects individuals exposed to socioeconomic disadvantage. It is, however, unclear how adverse socioeconomic conditions (SEC) at different periods of the life course predict the occurrence of multimorbidity in later life. In this scoping review, we investigate the association between life course SEC and later-life multimorbidity, and assess to which extent it supports different life course causal models (critical period, sensitive period, accumulation, pathway, or social mobility). We identified four studies (25,209 participants) with the first measure of SEC in childhood (before age 18). In these four studies, childhood SEC was associated with multimorbidity in old age, and the associations were partially or fully attenuated upon adjustment for later-life SEC. These results are consistent with the sensitive period and the pathway models. We identified five studies (91,236 participants) with the first measure of SEC in young adulthood (after age 18), and the associations with multimorbidity in old age as well as the effects of adjustment for later-life SEC differed from one study to the other. Among the nine included studies, none tested the social mobility or the accumulation models. In conclusion, SEC in early life could have an effect on multimorbidity, attenuated at least partly by SEC in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Advancing age is the most important risk factor of atrial fibrillation (AF). The shortening of telomere length is a biomarker of biologic aging. There is an increasing body of evidence that leucocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with the risk of AF development. However, the results in these studies were controversial. The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the role of LTL in predicting the incidence of AF. Observational studies reporting the association between LTL and the risk of AF were retrieved through 25th June, 2022 from PubMed and Embase. A total of twelve studies including 18,293 patients were included in the present analysis. Leucocyte telomere shortening was found to be an independent predictor of AF as a continuous variable in both univariate [OR:2.14; 95%CI(1.48,3.10); P < 0.0001] and multivariate analyses [OR:1.41;95%CI(1.11,1.79); P = 0.005], as well as categorical variable in multivariate analysis [OR:1.53; 95%CI(1.04,2.27); P = 0.03]. Furthermore, leucocyte telomere shortening was significantly associated with recurrent AF [OR:4.32;95%CI(2.42,7.69); P < 0.00001] but not new-onset AF [OR:1.14; 95%CI(0.90,1.45); P = 0.29]. Leucocyte telomere shortening was also associated with an increased risk of persistent AF [OR:14.73;95%CI (3.16,68.67); P = 0.0006] and paroxysmal AF [OR:2.74;95%CI(1.45,5.18); P = 0.002]. Besides, LTL was an independent predictor for progression from paroxysmal AF to persistent AF [OR:3.2;95%CI(1.66,6.18); P = 0.0005]. Differences between males [OR:1.99; 95%CI(1.29,3.06); P = 0.002] and females [OR:0.86; 95%CI (0.29,2.56);P = 0.79] were observed. Leucocyte telomere shortening predicts the risk of AF, especially recurrent AF. The predictive value is more prominent in males than in females. Shortening in LTL can predict the progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF.",

Addressing this question will help catalogue the progress made towards elucidating disease mechanisms, improving the clinical utility of the identified loci, and envisioning how we can harness the strides to develop translational GWAS strategies. Here we review the advances of PD GWAS made to date while critically addressing the challenges and opportunities for next-generation GWAS. Thus, deciphering the missing heritability in underrepresented populations is currently at the reach of hand for a truly comprehensive understanding of the genetics of PD across the different ethnicities. Moreover, state-of-the-art GWAS designs hold a true potential for enhancing the clinical applicability of genetic findings, for instance, by improving disease prediction (PD risk and progression). Lastly, advanced PD GWAS findings, alone or in combination with clinical and environmental parameters, are expected to have the capacity for defining patient enriched cohorts stratified by genetic risk profiles and readily available for neuroprotective clinical trials. Overall, envisioning future strategies for advanced GWAS is currently timely and can be instrumental in providing novel genetic readouts essential for a true clinical translatability of PD genetic findings.",

We consider therapeutic approaches used to counteract oxidative stress in glaucoma, including untapped treatment options such as novel plant-derived antioxidant compounds that can reduce oxidative stress and prevent neuronal loss. We summarize the current pre-clinical models and clinical work exploring the therapeutic potential of a range of candidate plant-derived antioxidant compounds. Finally, we explore advances in drug delivery systems, particular those employing nanotechnology-based carriers which hold significant promise as a carrier for antioxidants to treat age-related disease, thus reviewing the key current state of all of the aspects required towards translation.",

However, the evidence is sparse and for some nutrients, controversial. The aim of this narrative review is to gather the findings of observational and clinical trials involving human participants on the relationships between nutrients and brain Aβ status. Some dietary patterns are associated to reduced levels of Aβ in the brain, such as the Mediterranean diet, ketogenic diet as well as low intake of saturated fat, high-glycemic-index food, sodium, and junk/fast food. Low Aβ status in the brain was also associated with higher density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acids consumption. Data on alcohol intake is not conclusive. On the contrary, high Aβ levels in the brain were related to a higher intake of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol, saturated fat, sucrose, and fructose. Folic acid, cobalamin, vitamin E, and vitamin D were not associated to Aβ status, while high blood concentrations of Calcium, Aluminum, Zinc, Copper, and Manganese were associated with decreased Aβ blood levels but were not associated with Aβ cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. In conclusion, certain dietary patterns and nutrients are associated to brain Aβ status. Further research on the association between nutrients and brain Aβ status is needed in order to pave the way to use nutritional interventions as efficacious strategies to prevent Aβ disturbance and potentially AD.",

    "abstract": "Spinal stenosis is a common degenerative spine disorder in the aged population and the spinal ligament aging is a main contributor to this chronic disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of spinal ligament aging remain unclear. Epigenetics is the study of heritable and reversible changes in the function of a gene or genome that occur without any alteration in the primary DNA sequence. Epigenetic alterations have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in age-related diseases and conditions, and they are recently studied as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the field of cancer research. The main epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation alteration, histone modifications as well as dysregulated noncoding RNA modulation, have all been implicated in spinal ligament aging diseases. DNA methylation modulates the expression of critical genes including WNT5A, GDNF, ACSM5, miR-497 and miR-195 during spinal ligament degeneration. Histone modifications widely affect gene expression and obvious histone modification abnormalities have been found in spinal ligament aging. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) exert crucial regulating effects on spinal ligament aging conditions via targeting various osteogenic or fibrogenic differentiation related genes. To our knowledge, there is no systematic review yet to summarize the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms of spinal ligament aging in degenerative spinal diseases. In this study, we systematically discussed the different epigenetic modifications and their potential functions in spinal ligament aging process.",

    "abstract": "Annually, approximately 17 million people die from cardiovascular diseases worldwide, half of them suddenly. The most common direct cause of sudden cardiac death is ventricular arrhythmia triggered by an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The study summarizes the knowledge of the mechanisms of arrhythmia onset during ACS in humans and in animal models and factors that may influence the susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmias during ACS with particular focus on the age and sex. The real impact of age and sex on the arrhythmic susceptibility within the setting of acute ischaemia is masked by the fact that ACSs result from coronary artery disease appearing with age much earlier among men than among women. However, results of researches show that in ageing process changes with potential pro-arrhythmic significance, such as increased fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, decrease number of gap junction channels, disturbances of the intracellular Ca2+ signalling or changes in electrophysiological parameters, occur independently of the development of cardiovascular diseases and are more severe in male individuals. A review of the literature also indicates a marked paucity of research in this area in female and elderly individuals. Greater awareness of sex differences in the aging process could help in the development of personalized prevention methods targeting potential pro-arrhythmic factors in patients of both sexes to reduce mortality during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. This is especially important in an era of aging populations in which women will predominate due to their longer lifespan.",

However, in the last decades, a rich albeit fragmentary body of knowledge regarding both the incertal anatomical connections and functional implications has been built mostly based on rodent studies and its lack of cohesion makes difficult to depict an integrated, exhaustive picture regarding the ZI and its roles. This review aims to provide a unified resource that summarizes the current knowledge regarding the anatomical profile of interactions of the ZI in rodents and non-human primates and the functional significance of its connections, highlighting the aspects still unbeknown to research.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification of brain proteins including cell surface adhesion molecules, synaptic proteins, receptors and channels, as well as intracellular proteins, with implications in brain development and functions. Using advanced state-of-the-art glycomics and glycoproteomics technologies in conjunction with glycoinformatics resources, characteristic glycosylation profiles in brain tissues are increasingly reported in the literature and growing evidence shows deregulation of glycosylation in central nervous system disorders, including aging associated neurodegenerative diseases. Glycan signatures characteristic of brain tissue are also frequently described in cerebrospinal fluid due to its enrichment in brain-derived molecules. A detailed structural analysis of brain and cerebrospinal fluid glycans collected in publications in healthy and neurodegenerative conditions was undertaken and data was compiled to create a browsable dedicated set in the GlyConnect database of glycoproteins (https://glyconnect.expasy.org/brain). The shared molecular composition of cerebrospinal fluid with brain enhances the likelihood of novel glycobiomarker discovery for neurodegeneration, which may aid in unveiling disease mechanisms, therefore, providing with novel therapeutic targets as well as diagnostic and progression monitoring tools.",

    "abstract": "Repurposing drugs already approved in the clinic to be used off-label as geroprotectors, compounds that combat mechanisms of aging, are a promising way to rapidly reduce age-related disease incidence in society. Several recent studies have found that a class of drugs-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)-originally developed as treatments for cancers and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, could be repurposed to slow the aging process. Interestingly, these studies propose complementary mechanisms that target multiple hallmarks of aging. At the molecular level, NRTIs repress LINE-1 elements, reducing DNA damage, benefiting the hallmark of aging of 'Genomic Instability'. At the organellar level, NRTIs inhibit mitochondrial translation, activate ATF-4, suppress cytosolic translation, and extend lifespan in worms in a manner related to the 'Loss of Proteostasis' hallmark of aging. Meanwhile, at the cellular level, NRTIs inhibit the P2X7-mediated activation of the inflammasome, reducing inflammation and improving the hallmark of aging of 'Altered Intercellular Communication'. Future development of NRTIs for human aging health will need to balance out toxic side effects with the beneficial effects, which may occur in part through hormesis.",

    "abstract": "The geroscience hypothesis proposes biological hallmarks of ageing are modifiable. Increasing evidence supports targeting these hallmarks with therapeutics could prevent and ameliorate age-related conditions - collectively termed \"geroprotector drugs\". Cellular senescence is a hallmark with considerable potential to be modified with geroprotector drugs. Senotherapeutics are drugs that target cellular senescence for therapeutic benefit. Repurposing commonly used medications with secondary geroprotector properties is a strategy of interest to promote incorporation of geroprotector drugs into clinical practice. One candidate is the cardiac glycoside digoxin. Evidence in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis and atherosclerosis support digoxin as a senotherapeutic agent. Proposed senolytic mechanisms are upregulation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways and promoting intracellular acidification. Digoxin also appears to have a senomorphic mechanism - altering the T cell pool to ameliorate pro-inflammatory SASP. Despite being widely prescribed to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure, often in multimorbid older adults, it is not known whether digoxin exerts senotherapeutic effects in humans. Further cellular and animal studies, and ultimately clinical trials with participation of pre-frail older adults, are required to identify whether digoxin has senotherapeutic effect at low dose. This paper reviews the biological mechanisms identified in preliminary cellular and animal studies that support repurposing digoxin as a geroprotector in patients with frailty and multimorbidity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease characterized by the loss of cognitive function, confusion, and memory deficit. Accumulation of abnormal proteins, amyloid beta (Aß), and phosphorylated Tau (p-tau) forms plaques and tangles that deteriorate synapse function, resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD. The human brain is composed of different types of neurons and/or synapses that are functionally defective in AD. The GABAergic synapse, the most abundant inhibitory neuron in the human brain was found to be dysfunctional in AD and contributes to disrupting neurological function. This study explored the types of GABA receptors associated with neurological dysfunction and various biological and environmental factors that cause GABAergic neuron dysfunction in AD, such as Aβ, p-tau, aging, sex, astrocytes, microglia, APOE, mental disorder, diet, physical activity, and sleep. Furthermore, we explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of GABAergic synapse function in neurological disorders and AD states. We also discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying GABAergic synapse dysfunction with a focus on miR-27b, miR-30a, miR-190a/b, miR-33, miR-51, miR-129-5p, miR-376-3p, miR-376c, miR-30b and miR-502-3p. The purpose of our article is to highlight the recent research on miRNAs affecting the regulation of GABAergic synapse function and factors that contribute to the progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "Protein supplementation has shown to improve muscle mass in older adults. However, its effect may be influenced by supplementation dose, frequency and timing. This systematic review aimed to assess the effect of dose, frequency and timing of protein supplementation on muscle mass in older adults. Five databases were systematically searched from inception to 14 March 2023, for randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of protein supplementation on muscle mass in adults aged ≥65 years. Random effects meta-analyses were performed, stratified by population. Subgroups were created for dose (≥30 g, <30 g/day), frequency (once, twice, three times/day) and timing of supplementation (at breakfast, breakfast and lunch, breakfast and dinner, all meals, between meals). Heterogeneity within and between subgroups was assessed using I2 and Cochran Q statistics respectively. Thirty-eight articles were included describing community-dwelling (28 articles, n=3204, 74.6±3.4 years, 62.8% female), hospitalised (8 articles, n=590, 77.0±3.7 years, 50.3% female) and institutionalised populations (2 articles, n=156, 85.7±1.2 years, 71.2% female). Protein supplementation showed a positive effect on muscle mass in community-dwelling older adults (standardized mean difference 0.116; 95% confidence interval 0.032-0.200 kg, p=0.007, I2=15.3%) but the effect did not differ between subgroups of dose, frequency and timing (Q=0.056, 0.569 and 3.084 respectively, p>0.05). Data including hospitalised and institutionalised populations were limited. Protein supplementation improves muscle mass in community-dwelling older adults, but its dose, frequency or timing does not significantly influence the effect.",

    "abstract": "A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is a crucial transmembrane protein involved in diverse cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proteolysis. ADAM10's ability to cleave over 100 substrates underscores its significance in physiological and pathological contexts, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This review comprehensively examines ADAM10's multifaceted roles, highlighting its critical function in the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which mitigates amyloid beta (Aβ) production, a critical factor in AD development. We summarize the regulation of ADAM10 at multiple levels: transcriptional, translational, and post-translational, revealing the complexity and responsiveness of its expression to various cellular signals. A standardized nomenclature for ADAM10 isoforms is proposed to improve clarity and consistency in research, facilitating better comparison and replication of findings across studies. We address the challenges in detecting ADAM10 isoforms using antibodies, advocating for standardized detection protocols to resolve discrepancies in results from different biological matrices. By highlighting these issues, this review underscores the potential of ADAM10 as a biomarker for early diagnosis and a therapeutic target in AD. By consolidating current knowledge on ADAM10's regulation and function, we aim to provide insights that will guide future research and therapeutic strategies in the AD context.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Despite extensive research conducted on this disorder, its precise pathogenesis remains unclear. In recent years, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has attracted considerable attention within the field of AD. The gut microbiota communicates bidirectionally with the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis, and alterations in its structure and function can influence the progression of AD. Consequently, regulating the gut microbiota to mitigate the progression of AD has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach. Currently, numerous studies concentrate on the intrinsic relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and AD. In this paper, we summarize the multifaceted role of the gut microbiota in AD and present detailed therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota, including the treatment of AD with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for modulating the gut microbiota to alleviate the progression of AD, the current challenges in this area of research, and provide an outlook on future research directions in this field.",

    "abstract": "According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, accumulation of the amyloid peptide Aβ, derived by proteolytic processing from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the key pathogenic trigger in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This view has led researchers for more than two decades and continues to be the most influential model of neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, close scrutiny of the current evidence does not support a central pathogenic role for Aβ in late-onset AD. Furthermore, the amyloid cascade hypothesis lacks a theoretical foundation from which the physiological generation of Aβ can be understood, and therapeutic approaches based on its premises have failed. We present an alternative model of neurodegeneration, in which sustained cholesterol-associated neuronal distress is the most likely pathogenic trigger in late-onset AD, directly causing oxidative stress, inflammation and tau hyperphosphorylation. In this scenario, Aβ generation is part of an APP-driven adaptive response to the initial cholesterol distress, and its accumulation is neither central to, nor a requirement for, the initiation of the disease. Our model provides a theoretical framework that places APP as a regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, accounts for the generation of Aβ in both healthy and demented brains, and provides suitable targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Activities running in community-based-settings offer a method of delivering multimodal interventions to older adults beyond cognitive training programmes. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the impact of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of 'real-world' interventions on the cognitive abilities of healthy older adults. Database searches were performed between October 2016 and September 2018. Forty-three RCTs were eligible for inclusion with 2826 intervention participants and 2234 controls. Interventions to enhance cognitive ability consisted of participation in activities that were physical (25 studies), cognitive (9 studies), or mixed (i.e., physical and cognitive; 7 studies), and two studies used other interventions that included older adults assisting schoolchildren and engagement via social network sites. Meta-analysis revealed that Trail Making Test (TMT) A, p = 0.05, M = 0.43, 95% CI [-0.00, 0.86], digit symbol substitution, p = 0.05, M = 0.30, 95% CI [0.00, 0.59], and verbal fluency, p = 0.04, M = 0.31, 95% CI [0.02, 0.61], improved after specific types of interventions versus the control groups (which were either active, wait-list or passive controls). When comparing physical activity interventions against all control groups, TMT A, p = 0.04, M = 0.25, 95% CI [0.01, 0.48], and digit span forward, p = 0.05, M = 0.91, 95% CI [-0.00, 1.82], significantly improved. Results remained non-significant for all outcomes when comparing cognitive activity interventions against all control groups. Results therefore suggest that healthy older adults are more likely to see cognitive improvements when involved in physical activity interventions. In addition, TMT A was the only measure that consistently showed significant improvements following physical activity interventions. Visuospatial abilities (as measured by TMT A) may be more susceptible to improvement following physical activity-based interventions, and TMT A may be a useful tool for detecting differences in that domain.",

    "abstract": "Age-related eye diseases, including dry eye, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, represent a major global health issue based on their increasing prevalence and disabling action. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases will provide novel opportunities to reduce the burden of age-related eye diseases and improve eye health, contributing to sustainable development goals achievement. The impairment of neutrophil extracellular traps formation/degradation processes seems to be one of these mechanisms. These traps formed by a meshwork of DNA and neutrophil cytosolic granule proteins may exacerbate the inflammatory response promoting chronic inflammation, a pivotal cause of age-related diseases. In this review, we describe current findings that suggest the role of neutrophils and their traps in the pathogenesis of the above-mentioned age-related eye diseases. Furthermore, we discuss why these cells and their constituents could be biomarkers and therapeutic targets for dry eye, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. We also examine the therapeutic potential of some neutrophil function modulators and provide several recommendations for future research in age-related eye diseases.",

Molecular oxygen is pivotal to maintain tissue functions, and aerobic species have evolved a sophisticated sensing system to ensure proper oxygen supply and demand. It is not surprising that aberrations in oxygen and oxygen-associated pathways subvert health and promote different aspects of aging. In this review, we discuss emerging findings on how oxygen-sensing mechanisms regulate different cellular and molecular processes during normal physiology, and how dysregulation of oxygen availability lead to disease and aging. We describe various clinical manifestations associated with deregulation of oxygen balance, and how oxygen-modulating therapies and natural oxygen oscillations influence longevity. We conclude by discussing how a better understanding of oxygen-related mechanisms that orchestrate aging processes may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to extend healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is the accelerated loss of muscle mass, strength and function. Mitochondrial dysfunction was related to the progression of sarcopenia; meanwhile, microRNAs were regarded as core roles in regulating mitochondrial function. Physical exercise is a well-accepted approach to attenuate sarcopenia, yet very few studies depict the molecular mechanisms. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the potential relationships among physical exercise, mitochondrial function, and microRNAs, which may give new insight for retarding sarcopenia. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. The keywords were combined as \"(microRNA OR miR) AND mitochondri* AND muscle AND exercise\" and searched in all fields. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Information was extracted from the included studies for review. In this review, 18 preclinical studies and 5 clinical studies were included. Most of the included studies suggested that effective physical exercise had positive effects on mitochondrial functions by regulating microRNAs. The results showed that 12 microRNAs improved mitochondrial functions, while 18 microRNAs suppressed them. Meanwhile, the results showed that 5 microRNAs improved muscle performance. This systematic review provides an up-to-date sequential overview and highlights the potential relationship among exercise, mitochondrial function, and microRNAs in muscle. Meanwhile, evidence revealed that physical exercise can improve muscle performance by up-regulating mitochondrial functions, especially mitochondrial biogenesis, through modulating microRNAs.",

Circadian disturbance often predates the typical symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and is not only a non-motor symptom, but also one of the causes of their occurrence and progression. Glial cells possess circadian clocks that regulate their function to maintain brain development and homeostasis. Emerging evidence suggests that the microglial circadian clock is involved in the regulation of many physiological processes, such as cytokine release, phagocytosis, and nutritional and metabolic support, and that disruption of the microglia clock may affect multiple aspects of Parkinson's disease, especially neuroinflammation and α-synuclein processes. Herein, we review recent advances in the circadian control of microglia function in health and disease, and discuss novel pharmacological interventions for microglial clocks in neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "The present perspective article proposes an etiopathological model for multiple sclerosis pathogenesis and progression associated with the activation of human endogenous retroviruses. We reviewed preclinical, clinical, epidemiological, and evolutionary evidence indicating how the complex, multi-level interplay of genetic traits and environmental factors contributes to multiple sclerosis. We propose that in this process, endogenous retroviruses transactivation acts as a critical node in disease development. We also discuss the rationale for combined anti-retroviral therapy in multiple sclerosis as a disease-modifying therapeutic strategy. Finally, we propose that the immuno-pathogenic process triggered by endogenous retrovirus activation can be extended to aging and aging-related neurodegeneration. In this regard, endogenous retroviruses can be envisioned to act as epigenetic noise, favoring the proliferation of disorganized cellular subpopulations and accelerating system-specific \"aging\". Since inflammation and aging are two sides of the same coin (plastic dis-adaptation to external stimuli with system-specific degree of freedom), the two conditions may be epiphenomenal products of increased epigenomic entropy. Inflammation accelerates organ-specific aging, disrupting communication throughout critical systems of the body and producing symptoms. Overlapping neurological symptoms and syndromes may emerge from the activity of shared molecular networks that respond to endogenous retroviruses' reactivation.",

    "abstract": "Astronauts returning from space missions often exhibit health issues mirroring age-related conditions, suggesting spaceflight as a potential driver of biological ageing and age-related diseases. To unravel the underlying mechanisms of these conditions, this comprehensive review explores the impact of the space \"exposome\" on the twelve hallmarks of ageing. Through a meticulous analysis encompassing both space environments and terrestrial analogs, we aim to decipher how different conditions influence ageing hallmarks. Utilizing PubMed, we identified 189 studies and 60 meet screening criteria. Research on biological ageing in space has focused on genomic instability, chronic inflammation, and deregulated nutrient sensing. Spaceflight consistently induces genomic instability, linked to prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation, triggers pro-inflammatory and immune alterations, resembling conditions in isolated simulations. Nutrient sensing pathways reveal increased systemic insulin-like growth-factor- 1. Microbiome studies indicate imbalances favoring opportunistic species during spaceflight. Telomere dynamics present intriguing patterns, with lengthening during missions and rapid shortening upon return. Despite a pro-ageing trend, some protective mechanisms emerge. Countermeasures, encompassing dietary adjustments, prebiotics, postbiotics, symbiotics, tailored exercises, meditation, and anti-inflammatory supplements, exhibit potential. Spaceflight's impact on ageing is intricate, with diverse findings challenging established beliefs. Multidisciplinary studies provide guidance for future research in this field.",

In neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, TDP-43 can be mutated, mislocalised out of the nucleus of neurons and glial cells and form cytoplasmic inclusions. These TDP-43 alterations can lead to its RNA splicing dysregulation and contribute to mis-splicing of various types of RNA, such as mRNA, microRNA, and circular RNA. These changes can result in the generation of an altered transcriptome and proteome within cells, ultimately changing the diversity and quantity of gene products. In this review, we summarise the findings of novel atypical RNAs resulting from TDP-43 dysfunction and their potential as biomarkers or targets for therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "It is imperative to optimise health and healthspan across the lifespan. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been implicated in the hallmarks of ageing and inhibiting ROS production can potentially delay ageing whilst increasing healthy longevity. Lipids and lipid mediators (derivatives of lipids) are becoming increasingly recognized as central molecule in tissue and cellular function and are susceptible to peroxidation; hence linked with ageing. Lipid classes implicated in the ageing process include sterols, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and the oxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids but these are not yet translated into the clinic. Further mechanistic studies are required for the understanding of lipid classes in the ageing process. Lipidomics, the system level characterisation of lipid species with respect to metabolism and function, might provide a significant and useful biological age profiling tool through longitudinal studies. Lipid profiles in different ages among healthy individuals could be harnessed as lipid biomarkers of healthy ageing with potential integration for the development of lipid-based ageing clock (lipid clock). The potential of a lipid clock includes the prediction of future morbidity or mortality, which will promote precision and healthy longevity medicine.",

    "abstract": "Since the first description of a set of characteristics of aging as so-called hallmarks or pillars in 2013/2014, these characteristics have served as guideposts for the research in aging biology. They have been examined in a range of contexts, across tissues, in response to disease conditions or environmental factors, and served as a benchmark for various anti-aging interventions. While the hallmarks of aging were intended to capture generalizable characteristics of aging, they are derived mostly from studies of rodents and humans. Comparative studies of aging including species from across the animal tree of life have great promise to reveal new insights into the mechanistic foundations of aging, as there is a great diversity in lifespan and age-associated physiological changes. However, it is unclear how well the defined hallmarks of aging apply across diverse species. Here, we review each of the twelve hallmarks of aging defined by Lopez-Otin in 2023 with respect to the availability of data from diverse species. We evaluate the current methods used to assess these hallmarks for their potential to be adapted for comparative studies. Not unexpectedly, we find that the data supporting the described hallmarks of aging are restricted mostly to humans and a few model systems and that no data are available for many animal clades. Similarly, not all hallmarks can be easily assessed in diverse species. However, for at least half of the hallmarks, there are methods available today that can be employed to fill this gap in knowledge, suggesting that these studies can be prioritized while methods are developed for comparative study of the remaining hallmarks.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to reduce preventable medication-related harm through medication reviews have increased, but interventions often yield null-results regarding clinical outcomes. We conducted a systematic literature search in four data bases and summarised the available evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing medication reviews and usual care in hospitalised patients regarding hospital readmissions and all-cause mortality by random-effects meta-analyses. Effect size differences by methodological study differences were of special interest. The meta-analysis of all 24 trials on hospital readmissions, including 12,539 participants, showed a statistically significant 8% decrease in hospital readmissions (risk ratio (RR) [95% confidence interval]: (0.92 [0.88-0.97], p=0.002). The number of patient contacts was the most prominent effect modifier in meta-regression (p=0.003) and the effect of medication reviews was approximately twice as strong (15%) in 11 trials with 2 or more patient contacts (0.85 [0.78-0.92], p<0.001). No statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in a meta-analysis of all 22 trials with data for this outcome (0.95 [0.86-1.04], p=0.24), including 12,350 participants. The method of mortality assessment was identified as an effect modifier by meta-regression (p=0.01). A meta-analysis of 10 trials with complete mortality ascertainment via registries or primary care data showed a significantly 19% reduced mortality (0.81 [0.70-0.94], p<0.01)). In conclusion, medication reviews reduce the risk of hospital readmission and might also reduce all-cause mortality. Comprehensive mortality assessment was essential for successful trials. Clinical guidelines should recommend medication reviews with multiple patient contacts, involving pharmacists, either for repeated medication reviews or to improve adherence.",

    "abstract": "Although cancer treatment strategies have made considerable progress in recent decades, the challenge of selectively killing tumor cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue remains. Radiotherapy (RT) continues to be crucial for tumor growth control when combined with surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. RT effectiveness depends on factors such as cancer type, tumor features, and the choice of external or internal treatment. Given its non-invasive nature and low systemic toxicity, RT is a suitable strategy for elderly patients. However, despite its efficacy, variations in cell sensitivity to radiation influence treatment outcomes, and normal cells surrounding the tumor can also be affected. Radiation-induced DNA damage can trigger cellular senescence, a permanent cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, contributing to tissue damage in healthy cells and radio-resistance in tumor cells. RT causes not only DNA breakage but also epigenetic remodeling. Epigenetic pathways are involved in RT response, and the radiosensitivity of tumor cells can be modulated using epigenetic compounds. Emerging treatments based on more precise forms of RT, such as boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), offer promising results by selectively targeting tumors while potentially preserving healthy tissues. BNCT has shown efficacy in glioblastoma, recurrent head and neck carcinoma, and melanoma. This review i) examines the mechanisms and challenges of conventional RT, focusing on aging and its role in treatment efficacy and tolerability, ii) describes the impact of senescence and epigenetic factors on resistance, iii) explores advances in BNCT, and iv) considers the potential of epigenetic drugs to optimize RT outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The regenerative decline of organisms during ageing is linked to the reduced proliferative activity, impaired function and exhaustion of tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells. Studies using heterochronic parabiosis, involving the surgical attachment of young and old organisms so that they share a common vascular system, have revealed that the systemic environment has a profound effect on stem cell function. In particular, specific youthful rejuvenating circulatory factors reverse age-related declines in stem cell function, whereas the old milieu contains inhibitory factors that impede stem cell function in young animals. Similarly, the effects of certain dietary interventions, namely calorie restriction, also induce a more youthful cellular and molecular phenotype in ageing stem cells throughout the body. Further to this, there are key molecular pathways involved in translating the availability of nutrients into altered stem cell function, including signalling in the insulin and insulin-like growth factor and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. In this review, we discuss the potential role of dietary interventions to promote a more rejuvenating systemic milieu in order to enhance stem cell function and promote healthy ageing.",

    "abstract": "Brown and subcutaneous adipose tissues play a key role in non-shivering thermogenesis both in mice and human, and their activation by adrenergic stimuli promotes energy expenditure, reduces adiposity, and protects against age-related metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). Low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance characterize T2D. Even though the decline of thermogenic adipose tissues is well-established during ageing, the mechanisms by which this event affects immune system and contributes to the development of T2D is still poorly defined. It is emerging that activation of thermogenic adipose tissues promotes type 2 immunity skewing, limiting type 1 inflammation. Of note, metabolic substrates sustaining type 1 inflammation (e.g. glucose and succinate) are also used by activated adipocytes to promote thermogenesis. Keeping in mind this aspect, a nutrient competition between adipocytes and adipose tissue immune cell infiltrates could be envisaged. Herein, we reviewed the metabolic rewiring of adipocytes during thermogenesis in order to give important insight into the anti-inflammatory role of thermogenic adipose tissues and delineate how their decline during ageing may favor the setting of low-grade inflammatory states that predispose to type 2 diabetes in elderly. A brief description about the contribution of adipokines secreted by thermogenic adipocytes in modulation of immune cell activation is also provided. Finally, we have outlined experimental flow chart procedures and provided technical advices to investigate the physiological processes leading to thermogenic adipose tissue impairment that are behind the immunometabolic decline during aging.",

    "abstract": "Clinical frailty in the elderly is defined by a composite measure of functional psychomotor decline. Herein, we develop the concept of haemodynamic frailty (HDF), a state of increased predisposition to disease prevalent in the elderly and characterised by impairment of the network of compensatory responses governing the defence of circulatory volume and adaptive haemodynamic function. We review the factors predisposing the elderly to HDF, with a focus on the impaired capacity to sustain total body water balance. As a component of HDF, dehydration generates vulnerability to diseases caused by tissue hypoperfusion, including acute kidney injury. We provide a detailed mechanistic explanation of how dehydration and depletion of the intravascular volume impacts on renal blood flow to become an important element of the heightened risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the elderly. We bring these mechanistic considerations into the clinical context with reference to examples of how pre-renal (haemodynamic) and intrinsic (involving renal parenchymal damage) AKI risk is elevated in the setting of dehydration. Finally, we present HDF as a state of opportunity to prevent disease, for which diagnostic and interventional standards need to be refined. Further prospective studies are warranted to help clarify the clinical utility of assessing and managing HDF with regard to the mitigation of AKI risk in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Modifications of RNA, collectively called the \"epitranscriptome\", might provide novel biomarkers and innovative targets for interventions in geroscience but are just beginning to be studied in the context of ageing and stress resistance. RNA modifications modulate gene expression by affecting translation initiation and speed, miRNA binding, RNA stability, and RNA degradation. Nonetheless, the precise underlying molecular mechanisms and physiological consequences of most alterations of the epitranscriptome are still only poorly understood. We here systematically review different types of modifications of rRNA, tRNA and mRNA, the methodology to analyze them, current challenges in the field, and human disease associations. Furthermore, we compiled evidence for a connection between individual enzymes, which install RNA modifications, and lifespan in yeast, worm and fly. We also included resistance to different stressors and competitive fitness as search criteria for genes potentially relevant to ageing. Promising candidates identified by this approach include RCM1/NSUN5, RRP8, and F33A8.4/ZCCHC4 that introduce base methylations in rRNA, the methyltransferases DNMT2 and TRM9/ALKBH8, as well as factors involved in the thiolation or A to I editing in tRNA, and finally the m6A machinery for mRNA.",

These disorders usually converge on the same subject and associate with additive cognitive impairment. Abnormal Tau, TDP-43, and α-synuclein pathologies progress following a pattern consistent with an active cell-to-cell transmission and abnormal protein processing in the host cell. However, cell vulnerability and transmission pathways are specific for each disorder, albeit abnormal proteins may co-localize in particular neurons. All these alterations are unique or highly prevalent in humans. They all affect, at first, the archicortex and paleocortex to extend at later stages to the neocortex and other regions of the telencephalon. These observations show that the phylogenetically oldest areas of the human cerebral cortex and amygdala are not designed to cope with the lifespan of actual humans. New strategies aimed at reducing the functional overload of the human telencephalon, including optimization of dream repair mechanisms and implementation of artificial circuit devices to surrogate specific brain functions, appear promising.",

Therefore, we review these advances and examine the trends in the genetic aspects of hair graying from enrichment theory, Genome-Wide association studies, whole exome sequencing, gene expression studies, and animal models for hair graying with age, aiming to overview the changes in hair graying at the genetic level and establish the foundation for future research.

    "abstract": "Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is highly heterogeneous, varying by oncogenic signals and cellular context. While its dual role, in the initial inhibition potentially later leading to promotion of tumors through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, is still a matter of debate, it is undeniable that OIS is critical to understanding tumorigenesis. A major obstacle to OIS research is the absence of a universally accepted marker. Here, we present a robust OIS-specific transcriptomic secretory phenotype, termed oncogene-induced senescence secretory phenotype (OIS-SP), which can identify OIS across multiple biological contexts from in vitro datasets to in vivo human samples. We apply a meta-analytic machine learning pipeline to harmonize a deliberately varied selection of Ras-Raf-MEK-induced senescence datasets of differing origins, oncogenic signals and cell types. Finally we make use of bypass data to identify key genes and eliminate genes associated with quiescence, so identifying 40 OIS-SP genes. Within this set, we determined a robust core of five OIS-SP genes (FBLN1, CXCL12, EREG, CST1 and MMP10). Importantly, these 5 OIS-SP genes showed clear, consistent regulation patterns across various human Ras-Raf-MEK-mutated tumor tissues, which suggests that OIS-SP may be a novel cancer driver phenotype with an unexpectedly critical role in tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Ageing research has progressed rapidly through our ability to modulate the ageing process. Pharmacological and dietary treatments can increase lifespan and have been instrumental in our understanding of the mechanisms of ageing. Recently, several studies have reported genetic variance in response to these anti-ageing interventions, questioning their universal application and making a case for personalised medicine in our field. As an extension of these findings the response to dietary restriction was found to not be repeatable when the same genetic mouse lines were retested. We show here that this effect is more widespread with the response to dietary restriction also showing low repeatability across genetic lines in the fly (Drosophila melanogaster). We further argue that variation in reaction norms, the relationship between dose and response, can explain such conflicting findings in our field. We simulate genetic variance in reaction norms and show that such variation can: 1) lead to over- or under-estimation of treatment responses, 2) dampen the response measured if a genetically heterogeneous population is studied, and 3) illustrate that genotype-by-dose-by-environment interactions can lead to low repeatability of DR and potentially other anti-ageing interventions. We suggest that putting experimental biology and personalised geroscience in a reaction norm framework will aid progress in ageing research.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins into plaques. Individuals with AD frequently show mixed pathologies, often caused by cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), resulting in lesions such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH). The current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the cross-sectional relationship between amyloid burden and WMH in older adults without objective cognitive impairment. A systematic search performed in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO yielded 13 eligible studies. Aβ was assessed using PET, CSF, or plasma measurements. Two meta-analyses were performed: one on Cohen's d metrics and one on correlation coefficients. The meta-analyses revealed an overall weighted small-to-medium Cohen's d of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.31-0.78) in CSF, an overall correlation of 0.31 (0.09-0.50) in CSF, and a large Cohen's d of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.66-1.27) in PET. Only two studies assessed this relationship in plasma, with an effect size of - 0.20 (95% CI: -0.75 to 0.34). These findings indicate a relationship between both amyloid and vascular pathologies in cognitively normal adults in PET and CSF. Future studies should assess the possible relationship of blood amyloid-beta and WMH for broader identification of at risk individuals showing mixed pathology in preclinical stages.",

Given its high homology with apelin, the first ligand of APJ receptor, ELA likely mediates similar effects. Increasing evidence shows that ELA has a critical function not only in embryonic development, but also in adulthood, contributing to physiological and pathological conditions, such as the onset of age-related diseases (ARD). However, still little is known about the mechanisms and molecular pathways of ELA as well as its precise functions in ARD pathophysiology. Here, we report the mechanisms by which ELA/APJ signaling acts in a very complex network of pathways for the maintenance of physiological functions of human tissue and organs, as well as in the onset of some ARD, where it appears to play a central role. Therefore, we describe the possibility to use the ELA/APJ pathway, as novel biomarker (predictive and diagnostic) and target for personalized treatments of ARD. Its potentiality as an optimal peptide candidate for therapeutic ARD treatments is largely described, also detailing potential current limitations.",

It is characterized by changes in the blood vessels, such as macroscopically increased vascular diameter and intima-medial thickness, chronic inflammation, vascular calcification, arterial stiffening, and atherosclerosis. DNA damage and the subsequent various DNA damage response (DDR) pathways are important causative factors of vascular aging. Deficient DDR, which may result in the accumulation of unrepaired damaged DNA or mutations, can lead to vascular aging. On the other hand, over-activation of some DDR proteins, such as poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), also can enhance the process of vascular aging, suggesting that DDR can have both positive and negative effects on vascular aging. Despite the evidence reviewed in this paper, the role of DDR in vascular aging and potential therapeutic targets remain poorly understood and require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the reported benefits of diet on cognition in older adults, randomized controlled trials (RCT) testing the impact of dietary interventions on cognitive scores have yielded less promising results when cognition was assessed via neuropsychological tests. More recently, neuroimaging has been used to identify more subtle brain-related changes associated to cognition. Hence, employing a combination of neuroimaging techniques with neuropsychological tests could clarify this controversy. To determine the effect of diet on cognitive performance, we conducted a systematic review of PubMed and Scopus databases for all studies, on middle-aged and older adults, combining neuroimaging, neuropsychological tests, and data on dietary patterns. The inclusion criteria were met by 14 observational studies and no RCTs. The range of brain measures assessed varied from volumes to white matter integrity, functional connectivity, brain glucose metabolism and beta-amyloid deposition. Given the variability of methods used in assessing cognitive performance, diet and brain correlates, conducting a meta-analysis was not possible. Here the evidence suggests that, in observational studies, dietary patterns may be associated with brain correlates that have been shown to precede cognitive decline. As such, neuroimaging should be included in future RCTs to identify any benefits of diet on brain measures linked with cognitive health.",

This review aimed to critically appraise and summarise its measurement properties.Reports were eligible if they included results of studies aimed at developing the TFI or evaluating its measurement properties. We performed a literature search in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases from their inception until December 8, 2021. We also searched grey literature databases. We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the \"COSMIN Risk of Bias\". The measurement properties were evaluated using specific criteria. We graded the quality of the evidence using a GRADE approach.Sixty-three studies were included. We found moderate sufficient evidence for TFI content validity, although it is still insufficient for the comprehensiveness of its items. TFI construct validity was based on sufficient evidence from two studies of its structural validity as well as multiple hypothesis-testing for construct validity studies with inconsistent results. We did not find any studies that assessed cross-cultural validity. Only one of TFI's three dimensions showed sufficient evidence for the internal consistency of its scores, and results in test-retest reliability were inconsistent. The TFI showed high sufficient concurrent validity with the comprehensive geriatric assessment. We identified several studies assessing its predictive validity for adverse frailty-related outcomes, although most of the evidence from these studies was insufficient. We did not find any studies that assessed the responsiveness of TFI scores.The TFI had evidence gaps in several relevant measurement properties. Further research is needed to strengthen its usefulness as a clinical decision-making tool.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (CHI) causes brain aging, neurological disorders, cognitive decline, motor function impairment, and mortality. Inhibiting death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) has shown therapeutic potential against CHI, but several reports contradict its protective function, mechanism of activation, and signal transduction. Here, we systematically reviewed the role and the activation mechanism of DAPK1, and quantitatively assess the efficacy of DAPK1 inhibition (DI) methods in neuroprotection, following a CHI in animal models. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. Overall, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria, and the SYRCLE Risk of bias tool (RoB) tool was used to assess RoB. StataSE 16 was used for meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA). Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the effect size. DI was associated with the reduction of brain infarct volume (BIV) [SMD = -1.70, 95% CI (-2.10, -1.30); p = 0.00], neurological score (N.S.), neuronal degeneration, with no change in the level of in cell death [SMD = -0.83, 95% CI (-2.00, 0.35); p = 0.17], indicating the protective role of DI against CHI. No differences were found in DAPK1 mRNA and protein levels [SMD = 0.50, 95% CI (-0.05, 1.04); p = 0.07] {single-study driven; upregulated after exclusion (p = 0.01, I2 = 36.43)}, whereas phospho-DAPK1 [SMD = -2.22, 95% CI (-3.69, -0.75); p = 0.00] was downregulated and phosphorylated myosin light chain [SMD = 3.37, 95% CI (2.51, 4.96); p = 0.00] was upregulated between CHI and sham groups. Furthermore, we performed NMA to understand the molecular level at which DI offers maximum protection against BIV. Post-transcriptional inhibition (PTI; SUCRA, 82.6%) and gene knockout showed best (KO; SUCRA, 81.3%), signal transduction inhibition (STI; SUCRA, 49.5%) offered 3rd best, while catalytic activity inhibition (CAI; SUCRA, 0.3%) exhibited the lowest reduction in BIV against CHI. The results demonstrate that DI has a neuroprotective effect against CHI and DAPK1 might be regulated at the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels after CHI. Inhibiting DAPK1 at the post-transcriptional level and blocking multiple signal transduction pathways of DAPK1 could lead to better functional recovery against CHI.

In addition, the prevalence of IDD tends to be younger, which brings a huge burden to individuals and society economically. Current treatments do not delay or reverse the progression of IDD. The emergence of biologic therapies has brought new hope for the treatment of IDD. Among them, extracellular vesicles (EVs), as nanoscale bioactive substances that mediate cellular communication, have now produced many surprising results in the research of the treatment of IDD. This article reviews the mechanisms and roles of EVs in delaying IDD and describes the prospects and challenges of EVs.",

The six therapies include: 1) treatments addressing levels of TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin, that become significantly reduced after MCI transitions to AD, and addressing also the impaired epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in AD's pathogenesis; 2) and 3) are two formulations that address the inadequate counter-responses to initial loss of cognition; 4) treatments addressing the brain cells whose impaired functions result in MCI and dementia; 5) the need for using partner drugs even when a particular drug addresses a single pathogenetic cause such as amyloid deposition; 6) enhancing the likelihood of genuine cure by using combinations of approaches chosen from the foregoing. Briefly, genuine cure of AD is possible; however, since AD denotes not one but multiple, phenotypically similar conditions, no one therapy can be generalized to all cases.",

In vitro and in vivo models coupled with multiomic techniques have provided important contributions to unraveling the pathomechanisms underlying ALS. To date, despite promising results and accumulating knowledge, an effective treatment is still lacking. Here, we provide an overview of the literature on the use of genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and microRNAs to deeply investigate the molecular mechanisms developing and sustaining ALS. We report the most relevant genes implicated in ALS pathogenesis, discussing the use of different high-throughput sequencing techniques and the role of epigenomic modifications. Furthermore, we present transcriptomic studies discussing the most recent advances, from microarrays to bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. Finally, we discuss the use of microRNAs as potential biomarkers and promising tools for molecular intervention. The integration of data from multiple omic approaches may provide new insights into pathogenic pathways in ALS by shedding light on diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, helping to stratify patients into clinically relevant subgroups, revealing novel therapeutic targets and supporting the development of new effective therapies.",

ADP-ribosylation is a reversible modification onto proteins and nucleic acids to alter their structures and/or functions. Growing evidence support the importance of ADP-ribosylation and ADP-ribosylation-associated enzymes in aging and age-related diseases. In this review, we summarized ADP-ribosylation-associated proteins including ADP-ribosyl transferases, the ADP-ribosyl hydrolyses and ADP-ribose binding domains. Furthermore, we outlined the latest knowledge about regulation of ADP-ribosylation in the pathogenesis and progression of main aging-related diseases, organism aging and cellular senescence, and we also speculated the underlying mechanisms to better disclose this novel molecular network. Moreover, we discussed current issues and provided an outlook for future research, aiming to revealing the unknown bio-properties of ADP-ribosylation, and establishing a novel therapeutic perspective in aging-related diseases and health aging via targeting ADP-ribosylation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding mechanisms of ageing remains a complex challenge for biogerontologists, but recent adaptations of evolutionary ageing theories offer a compelling lens in which to view both age-related molecular and physiological deterioration. Ageing is commonly associated with progressive declines in biochemical and molecular processes resulting from damage accumulation, yet the role of continued developmental gene activation is less appreciated. Natural selection pressures are at their highest in youthful periods to modify gene expression towards maximising reproductive capacity. After sexual maturation, selective pressure diminishes, subjecting individuals to maladaptive pleiotropic gene functions that were once beneficial for developmental growth but become pathogenic later in life. Due to this selective 'shadowing' in ageing, mechanisms to counter such hyper/hypofunctional genes are unlikely to evolve. Interventions aimed at targeting gene hyper/hypofunction during ageing might, therefore, represent an attractive therapeutic strategy. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers a strong model for post-reproductive mechanistic and therapeutic investigations, yet studies examining the mechanisms of, and countermeasures against, ageing decline largely intervene from larval stages onwards. Importantly, however, lifespan extending conditions frequently impair early-life fitness and fail to correspondingly increase healthspan. Here, we consolidate multiple evolutionary theories of ageing and discuss data supporting hyper/hypofunctional changes at a global molecular and functional level in C. elegans, and how classical lifespan-extension mutations alter these dynamics. The relevance of such mutant models for exploring mechanisms of ageing are discussed, highlighting that post-reproductive gene optimisation represents a more translatable approach for C. elegans research that is not constrained by evolutionary trade-offs. Where some genetic mutations in C. elegans that promote late-life health map accordingly with healthy ageing in humans, other widely used genetic mutations that extend worm lifespan are associated with life-limiting pathologies in people. Lifespan has also become the gold standard for quantifying 'ageing', but we argue that gerospan compression (i.e., 'healthier' ageing) is an appropriate goal for anti-ageing research, the mechanisms of which appear distinct from those regulating lifespan alone. There is, therefore, an evident need to re-evaluate experimental approaches to study the role of hyper/hypofunctional genes in ageing in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Neurofilaments are intermediate filaments present in neurons. These provide structural support and maintain the size and shape of the neurons. Dysregulation, mutation, and aggregation of neurofilaments raise the levels of these proteins in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which are characteristic features of axonal damage and certain rare neurological diseases, such as Giant Axonal Neuropathy and Charcot-Mare-Tooth disease. Understanding the structure, dynamics, and function of neurofilaments has been greatly enhanced by a diverse range of biochemical and preclinical investigations conducted over more than four decades. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in post-translational modifications of neurofilaments, such as phosphorylation, aggregation, mutation, oxidation, etc. Over the past twenty years, several rare disorders have been studied from structural alterations of neurofilaments. These disorders are monitored by fluid biomarkers such as neurofilament light chains. Currently, there are many tools, such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Electrochemiluminescence Assay, Single-Molecule Array, Western/immunoblotting, etc., in use to assess the neurofilament proteins in Blood and CSF. However, all these techniques utilize expensive, non-specific, or antibody-based methods, which make them unsuitable for routine screening of neurodegenerative disorders. This provides room to search for newer sensitive, cost-effective, point-of-care tools for rapid screening of the disease. For a long time, the molecular mechanisms of neurofilaments have been poorly understood due to insufficient research attempts, and a deeper understanding of them remains elusive. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the available literature on molecular mechanisms of neurofilaments and the function of neurofilaments in axonal transport, axonal conduction, axonal growth, and neurofilament aggregation, respectively. Further, this review discusses the role of neurofilaments as potential biomarkers for the identification of several neurodegenerative diseases in clinical laboratory practice.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a phenomenon of major relevance in neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders, cataracts, diabetes and many other diseases. Research has unveiled that proteins also aggregate in multiple tissues during healthy aging yet, the biological and biomedical relevance of this apparently asymptomatic phenomenon remains to be understood. It is known that proteome homeostasis (proteostasis) is maintained by a balanced protein synthesis rate, high protein synthesis accuracy, efficient protein folding and continual tagging of damaged proteins for degradation, suggesting that protein aggregation during healthy aging may be associated with alterations in both protein synthesis and the proteostasis network (PN) pathways. In particular, dysregulation of protein synthesis and alterations in translation fidelity are hypothesized to lead to the production of misfolded proteins which could explain the occurrence of age-related protein aggregation. Nevertheless, some data on this topic is controversial and the biological mechanisms that lead to widespread protein aggregation remain to be elucidated. We review the recent literature about the age-related decline of proteostasis, highlighting the need to build an integrated view of protein synthesis rate, fidelity and quality control pathways in order to better understand the proteome alterations that occur during aging and in age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Apathy is frequent and persistent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with poor prognosis and carer distress; yet our knowledge of risk factors remains limited.To identify risk factors associated with apathy incidence and progression in AD over time.We systematically reviewed evidence based on longitudinal studies assessing risk factors for apathy in AD up to June 2021. Two authors independently assessed article eligibility and rated quality.13,280 articles were screened, of which 13 met inclusion criteria. Studies had a mean follow-up of 2.7 years reporting on a total of 2012 participants. Most findings were based on single studies of moderate quality evidence. Risk factors increasing apathy onset were: being a carrier of the T allele of the PRND gene polymorphism, and having high levels of the IL-6 and TNFα cytokines at baseline. Risk factors for apathy worsening were: reduced inferior-temporal cortical thickness, taking antidepressants, being an ApoE ε4 carrier, living longer with AD, lower cognitive test scores, higher baseline apathy, premorbid personality traits (lower agreeableness, higher neuroticism), and higher midlife motivational abilities.Although results are limited by the small number of studies, this review identified specific genetic, neurobiological, AD specific, and dispositional factors that may increase risk of apathy onset and worsening in AD.",

    "abstract": "This article brings a new perspective on oral physiology by presenting the oral organ as an integrated entity within the entire organism and its surrounding environment. Rather than considering the mouth solely as a collection of discrete functions, this novel approach emphasizes its role as a dynamic interphase, supporting interactions between the body and external factors. As a resilient ecosystem, the equilibrium of mouth ecological niches is the result of a large number of interconnected factors including the heterogeneity of different oral structures, diversity of resources, external and internal pressures and biological actors. The manuscript seeks to deepen the understanding of age-related changes within the oral cavity and throughout the organism, aligning with the evolving field of gerophysiology. The strategic position and fundamental function of the mouth make it an invaluable target for early prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and even reversal of aging effects throughout the entire organism. Recognizing the oral cavity capacity for sensory perception, element capture and information processing underscores its vital role in continuous health monitoring. Overall, this integrated understanding of the oral physiology aims at advancing comprehensive approaches to the oral healthcare and promoting broader awareness of its implications on the overall well-being.",

    "abstract": "This scoping review aims at giving an overview of the possible influence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) on cognitive-behavioral neurodegenerative diseases (CBNDs). Based on the PRISMA-ScR checklist, it details the methods of NDDs screening, the identified NDDs-CBNDs associations, as well as the criteria and types of association. The last literature search was performed in June 2023. In the final study, 32 articles were included. Analysis first showed that NDDs were mainly detected through medical records screening. Second, the association of specific learning disorders and major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease was the most investigated. Third, associations were mostly based on prevalence comparisons. Finally, 66 % of studies reported a positive association between NDDs and CBNDs. Notably, up to 67 % of positive associations were observed with atypical forms of certain CBNDs. Authors' interpretations suggest that NDDs could constitute a risk factor for CBNDs. However, the influence of NDDs on CBNDs still lacks evidence and biological support, possibly due to the heterogeneity of methods and criteria employed. Developing validated assessment tools for all NDDs and conducting cohort studies could be beneficial for research, and clinical practice. Indeed, this review also underlines the importance of adopting a life-span approach regarding CBNDs.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most predominant neurodegenerative disease and a quintessential entity within the dementia umbrella, is a global public health crisis. While the lack of disease modifying therapies has been a weak point in AD treatment, the success of recently approved monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics (aducanumab and lecanemab) targeted at the removal of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides in the brain is still under debate. There are multiple safety concerns about these approved neurotherapeutics including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, and even death. Novel paradigms focused on aquaporin-4-mediated neuro-perivascular Aβ and Tau protein clearance pathway are garnering attention. In this paper, we argue that orchestrating the drug discovery focused on glymphatic clearance-facilitating drugs (\"glymphotherapeutics\") might be a potentially novel and viable strategy to mitigate the progression and improve the clinical outcomes of AD.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral perfusion dysfunctions are seen in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We systematically reviewed the literature to investigate the effect of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on cerebral hemodynamics in randomized controlled trials involving AD patients or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD. Studies involving other dementia types were excluded. Data was searched in April 2021 on MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A meta-synthesis was performed separating results from MCI and AD studies. 31 studies were included and involved 310 MCI and 792 CE patients. The MCI studies (n = 8) included physical, cognitive, dietary, and pharmacological interventions. The AD studies (n = 23) included pharmacological, physical interventions, and phytotherapy. Cerebral perfusion was assessed with PET, ASL, Doppler, fNIRS, DSC-MRI, Xe-CT, and SPECT. Randomization and allocation concealment methods and subject characteristics such as AD-onset, education, and ethnicity were missing in several papers. Positive effects on hemodynamics were seen in 75 % of the MCI studies, and 52 % of the AD studies. Inserting cerebral perfusion outcome measures, together with established AD biomarkers, is fundamental to target all disease mechanisms and understand the role of cerebral perfusion in AD.",

Despite considerable research progress, there remain gaps in our understanding of the pathophysiology and there is no disease-modifying treatment. Proteomics is a powerful tool to elucidate complex biological pathways across heterogenous conditions. This review summarizes the widely used proteomic methods and presents evidence for protein dysregulation in the brain and peripheral tissues in DLB. Proteomics of post-mortem brain tissue shows that DLB shares common features with other dementias, such as synaptic dysfunction, but retains a unique protein signature. Promising diagnostic biomarkers are being identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and peripheral tissues, such as serum Heart-type fatty acid binding protein. Research is needed to track these changes from the prodromal stage to established dementia, with standardized workflows to ensure replicability. Identifying novel protein targets in causative biological pathways could lead to the development of new targeted therapeutics or the stratification of participants for clinical trials.",

However, there are conflicting reports regarding the level of norepinephrine and its metabolites (3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) and 3,4 -dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL)) in AD patients. Uncover these alterations may be a key factor for understanding cognitive deficits and AD pathology. We review the literature that compare norepinephrine and its metabolites between AD patients and non-demented controls. A meta-analysis did not reveal significant statistical differences, but there was a trend towards a lower level of norepinephrine of AD, with almost no difference in MHPG in the cerebrospinal fluid. Regarding MHPG in plasma, DHPG and DOPEGAL we only performed a qualitative analyse due to the small or absent number of studies. These findings point to a decrease in norepinephrine, what is in line with locus coeluleus cell loss in AD. The absence of statistical difference and an equal level of MHGP could indicate a compensatory mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is prevalent in aged populations and is associated with disability and distress for those affected. Therapeutic benefits of drugs targeting dementia are small. Impaired nutrient sensing pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of dementia and may offer a novel treatment target. This systematic review collated evidence for novel therapeutic compounds that modify nutrient sensing pathways, particularly the sirtuin pathway, in preventing cognitive decline or improving cognition in normal ageing, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched using key search terms. Articles were screened using Covidence systematic review software. The risk of bias was assessed using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE)'s risk of bias tool for animal studies and Cochrane Risk of Bias tool v 2.0 for human studies. Out of 3841 articles, 68 were included describing 38 different novel therapeutic compounds that modulate the nutrient sensing pathway via the sirtuin pathway. In animal models (58 studies), all investigated novel therapeutic compounds showed cognitive benefits. Ten studies were human intervention trials targeting normal ageing (1 study) and dementia populations (9 studies). Direct sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog) 1 (SIRT1) activators Resveratrol and Nicotinamide derivatives improved cognitive outcomes among human subjects with normal cognition and MCI. Animal studies support that modulation of the sirtuin pathway has the potential to improve cognitive outcomes. Overall, there is a clear lack of translation from animal models to human populations.",

    "abstract": "A plethora of genetic and molecular mechanisms have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the heterogeneous and multifactorial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease, and hence the conventional \"one target-one drug\" paradigm has failed so far to provide effective therapeutic solutions, precisely because of the complex nature of ALS. This review intends to highlight how the integration of emerging \"omics\" approaches may provide a rational foundation for the comprehensive exploration of molecular pathways and dynamic interactions involved in ALS, for the identification of candidate targets and biomarkers that will assist in the rapid diagnosis and prognosis, lastly for the stratification of patients into different subgroups with the aim of personalized therapeutic strategies. To this purpose, particular emphasis will be placed on some potential therapeutic targets, including neurotrophic factors and histamine signaling that both have emerged as dysregulated at different omics levels in specific subgroups of ALS patients, and have already shown promising results in in vitro and in vivo models of ALS. To conclude, we will discuss about the utility of using integrated omics coupled with network-based approaches to provide additional guidance for personalization of medicine applications in ALS.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is a debilitating syndrome that significantly impacts individuals over the age of 65 years. There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for dementia. Impairment of nutrient sensing pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dementia, and may offer a novel treatment approach for dementia.This systematic review collates all available evidence for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics that modify nutrient sensing in the context of preventing cognitive decline or improving cognition in ageing, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia populations.PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched using key search terms focusing on available therapeutics such as 'metformin', 'GLP1', 'insulin' and the dementias including 'Alzheimer's disease' and 'Parkinson's disease'. Articles were screened using Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool v 2.0 for human studies and SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies.Out of 2619 articles, 114 were included describing 31 different 'modulation of nutrient sensing pathway' therapeutics, 13 of which specifically were utilized in human interventional trials for normal ageing or dementia. Growth hormone secretagogues improved cognitive outcomes in human mild cognitive impairment, and potentially normal ageing populations. In animals, all investigated therapeutic classes exhibited some cognitive benefits in dementia models. While the risk of bias was relatively low in human studies, this risk in animal studies was largely unclear.Modulation of nutrient sensing pathway therapeutics, particularly growth hormone secretagogues, have the potential to improve cognitive outcomes. Overall, there is a clear lack of translation from animal models to human populations.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a state of growth arrest that occurs after cells encounter various stresses. Senescence contributes to tumour suppression, embryonic development, and wound healing. It impacts on the pathology of various diseases by secreting inflammatory chemokines, immune modulators and other bioactive factors. These secretory biosignatures ultimately cause inflammation, tissue fibrosis, immunosenescence and many ageing-related diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF). Because the molecular mechanisms underpinning AF development remain unclear, current treatments are suboptimal and have serious side effects. In this review, we summarize recent results describing the role of senescence in AF. We propose that senescence factors induce AF and have a causative role. Hence, targeting senescence and its secretory phenotype may attenuate AF.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is considered a chronic inflammatory disease of arteries associated with the aging process. Many risk factors have been identified and they are mainly related to life-styles, gene-environment interactions and socioeconomic status. Carotid and coronary artery diseases are the two major atherosclerotic conditions, being the primary cause of stroke and heart attack, respectively. Nevertheless, carotid plaque assumes particular aspects not only for the specific molecular mechanisms, but also for the types of atheroma which may be associated with a better or a worst prognosis. The identification of circulating blood biomarkers able to distinguish carotid plaque types (stable or vulnerable) is a crucial step for the improvement of adequate therapeutic approaches avoiding or delaying endarterectomy in the oldest old individuals (> 80 years), a population predicted to growth in the next years. The review highlights the most recent knowledge on carotid plaque molecular mechanisms, focusing on microRNAs (miRs), as a site-specific accelerated aging within the conceptual framework of Geroscience for new affordable therapies.",

    "abstract": "Life has persisted for about 3.5 billion years (Gy) despite fluctuating environmental pressures and the aging and mortality of individuals. The disposable soma theory (DST) notoriously contributes to explain this persistence for lineages with a clear soma/germen distinction. Beyond such lineages however, the phylogenetic scope of application of the DST is less obvious. Typically, the DST is not expected to explain the survival of microbial species that comprise single-celled organisms apparently lacking a germen/soma distinction. Here, we present an evolutionary argument that generalizes the explanatory scope of DST to the entire microbial world and provides a novel characterization of the deep molecular and evolutionary roots supporting this expanded disposable soma theory of aging. Specifically, we argue that the germen/soma distinction arose early in evolution and identify DNA semi-conservative replication as a critical process through which two forms of rejuvenation could have evolved in the first microbes. Our hypothesis has fundamental and practical implications. First, whereas unicellular organisms were long thought of as potentially immortal, we suggest instead that all unicellular individuals (prokaryotes or protists alike) are very likely to age, either replicatively or physiologically, or both. Second, our theory introduces a profound reconsideration of microbial individuality, whereby, all microbial individuals, as seen by natural selection, present an obligate transient germen/soma distinction during their life cycles. Third, our work promotes the study of cellular division in prokaryotes and in protist mitosis to illuminate the evolutionary origin of the soma and germen division, traditionally studied in animals. These ideas set the stage for progress in the evolutionary theory of aging from a heretofore overlooked microbial perspective.",

    "abstract": "Aged care facilities (ACFs) are a high-risk COVID-19 transmission setting, and older residents are at greater risk of severe outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed whether universal masking and COVID-19 vaccination reduce SARS-CoV-2 attack rates (ARs) in ACFs. Articles published between 1 December 2019 and 28 February 2022 were screened across five databases (Medline, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)). Risk of bias was assessed using relevant Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Meta-analysis of single proportions, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression were performed to compare the effects of universal masking and vaccination dosage on pooled SARS-CoV-2 ARs. Of 99 included articles, SARS-COV-2 ARs for residents were available in 86 studies (representing 139 outbreaks), and for staff in 49 studies (78 outbreaks). Universal masking was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 ARs in ACF outbreaks (AR = 34.9% [95% CI: 27.2-42.6%]) compared to facilities without universal masking (67.3% [54.2-80.4%], p<.0001). In ACFs with universal masking prior to outbreak onset, facility-wide testing, and documentation of asymptomatic infection, the asymptomatic AR at time of testing was 11.4% (6.5-17.4%) in residents. Receipt of zero, one and two vaccination doses were associated with ARs of 64.9% (49.6-80.2%), 54.9% (33.7-76.1%) and 45.2% (29.2-61.3%), respectively. To protect residents from COVID-19, ACFs should provide vaccination of residents and staff, universal masking for staff, and facility-wide testing during times of heightened community transmission.",

    "abstract": "The recently announced revision of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostic ATN classification adds to an already existing disregard for clinical assessment the rejection of image-based in vivo assessment of the brain's condition. The revision suggests that the diagnosis of AD should be based solely on the presence of cerebral amyloid-beta and tau, indicated by the “A” and \"T\". The \"N\", which stands for neurodegeneration – detected by imaging – should no longer be given importance, except that A+ ± T + = AD with amyloid PET being the main method for demonstrating A+. We believe this is an artificial and misleading suggestion. It is artificial because it relies on biomarkers whose significance remains obscure and where the detection of “A” is based on a never-validated PET method using a tracer that marks much more than amyloid-beta. It is misleading because many patients without dementia will be falsely classified as having AD, but nonetheless candidates for passive immunotherapy, which may be more harmful than beneficial, and sometimes fatal.",

    "abstract": "The retina has been considered a \"window to the brain\" and shares similar innervation by the dopaminergic system with the cortex in terms of an unequal distribution of D1 and D2 receptors. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview that Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a non-invasive imaging technique, which provides an \"in vivo\" representation of the retina, shows promise to be used as a surrogate marker of dopaminergic neuromodulation in cognition. Overall, most evidence supports reduced retinal thickness in individuals with dopaminergic dysregulation (e.g., patients with Parkinson's Disease, non-demented older adults) and with poor cognitive functioning. By using the theoretical framework of metacontrol, we derive hypotheses that retinal thinning associated to decreased dopamine (DA) levels affecting D1 families, might lead to a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) affecting cognitive persistence (depending on D1-modulated DA activity) but not cognitive flexibility (depending on D2-modulated DA activity). We argue that the use of OCT parameters might not only be an insightful for cognitive neuroscience research, but also a potentially effective tool for individualized medicine with a focus on cognition. As our society progressively ages in the forthcoming years and decades, the preservation of cognitive abilities and promoting healthy aging will hold of crucial significance. OCT has the potential to function as a swift, non-invasive, and economical method for promptly recognizing individuals with a heightened vulnerability to cognitive deterioration throughout all stages of life.",

    "abstract": "With geroscience research evolving at a fast pace, the need arises for human randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy of geroprotective interventions to prevent age-related adverse outcomes, disease, and mortality in normative aging cohorts. However, to confirm efficacy requires a long-term and costly approach as time to the event of morbidity and mortality can be decades. While this could be circumvented using sensitive biomarkers of aging, current molecular, physiological, and digital endpoints require further validation. In this review, we discuss how collecting real-world evidence (RWE) by obtaining health data that is amenable for collection from large heterogeneous populations in a real-world setting can help speed up validation of geroprotective interventions. Further, we propose inclusion of quality of life (QoL) data as a biomarker of aging and candidate endpoint for geroscience clinical trials to aid in distinguishing healthy from unhealthy aging. We highlight how QoL assays can aid in accelerating data collection in studies gathering RWE on the geroprotective effects of repurposed drugs to support utilization within healthy longevity medicine. Finally, we summarize key metrics to consider when implementing QoL assays in studies, and present the short-form 36 (SF-36) as the most well-suited candidate endpoint.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) represent a class of neurological disorders characterized by the progressive degeneration or loss of neurons, impacting millions of individuals globally. In addition to the typical manifestations, pain is a prevalent symptom associated with NDDs, seriously impacting the quality of life for patients. The pathogenesis of pain associated with NDDs is intricate and multifaceted. Currently, the clinical management of NDDs-related pain symptoms predominantly relies on conventional pharmacological agents or physical therapy. However, these approaches often fail to produce satisfactory outcomes. This article summarizes the underlying mechanisms of major NDDs-associated pain: Neuroinflammation, Brain and spinal cord dysfunctions, Mitochondrial dysfunction, Risk gene and pathological protein, as well as Receptor, channel, and neurotransmitter. While numerous studies have investigated the downstream pathological processes associated with these mechanisms, there remains a significant gap in identifying the key initiating factors. Specifically, there is insufficient evidence for the upstream elements that activate microglia and astrocytes in neuroinflammation leading to pain in NDDs. Likewise, there is an absence of upstream factors elucidating how dysfunctions in the brain and spinal cord, as well as mitochondrial impairments, contribute to the development of pain. Furthermore, the specific mechanisms through which hallmark pathological proteins related to NDDs contribute to these pathological processes remain inadequately understood. The objective of this article is to synthesize the existing mechanisms underlying pain associated with NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Schizophrenia, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Multiple sclerosis, while also identifying gaps and deficiencies in these mechanisms. This paper offers insights for future research trajectories. Given the intricate pathogenesis of NDDs-related pain, it emphasizes that a promising short-term strategy is combination therapy-intervening concurrently in multiple pathological processes-akin to the cocktail approach utilized in treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). For long-term advancements, achieving breakthroughs in the treatment of the NDDs themselves will remain essential for alleviating accompanying pain symptoms.",

    "abstract": "During the last few decades, life expectancy has increased worldwide along with the prevalence of several age-related diseases. Among aging pathways, cellular senescence and chronic inflammation (or \"inflammaging\") appear to be connected to gut homeostasis and dysbiosis of the microbiome. Cellular senescence is a state of essentially irreversible cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to stress. Although senescent cells (SC) remain metabolically active, they do not proliferate and can secrete inflammatory and other factors comprising the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Accumulation of SCs has been linked to onset of several age-related diseases, in the brain, bones, the gastrointestinal tract, and other organs and tissues. The gut microbiome undergoes substantial changes with aging and is tightly interconnected with either successful (healthy) aging or disease. Senotherapeutic drugs are compounds that can clear senescent cells or modulate the release of SASP factors and hence attenuate the impact of the senescence-associated pro-inflammatory state. Phytochemicals, phenolic compounds and terpenes, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, could also be senotherapeutic given their ability to act upon senescence-linked cellular pathways. The aim of this review is to dissect links among the gut microbiome, cellular senescence, inflammaging, and disease, as well as to explore phytochemicals as potential senotherapeutics, focusing on their interactions with gut microbiota. Coordinated targeting of these inter-related processes might unveil new strategies for promoting healthy aging.",

Our requirements motivate the use of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs and dedicated workflows employing, e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

    "abstract": "This review provides an in-depth analysis of the complex role of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) in the development of α-synucleinopathies, with a particular focus on its structural diversity and the resulting clinical variability. The ability of α-Syn to form different strains or polymorphs and undergo various post-translational modifications significantly contributes to the wide range of symptoms observed in disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA), as well as in lesser-known non-classical α-synucleinopathies. The interaction between genetic predispositions and environmental factors further complicates α-synucleinopathic disease pathogenesis, influencing the disease-specific onset and progression. Despite their common pathological hallmark of α-Syn accumulation, the clinical presentation and progression of α-synucleinopathies differ significantly, posing challenges for diagnosis and treatment. The intricacies of α-Syn pathology highlight the critical need for a deeper understanding of its biological functions and interactions within the neuronal environment to develop targeted therapeutic strategies. The precise point at which α-Syn aggregation transitions from being a byproduct of initial disease triggers to an active and independent driver of disease progression - through the propagation and acceleration of pathogenic processes - remains unclear. By examining the role of α-Syn across various contexts, we illuminate its dual role as both a marker and a mediator of disease, offering insights that could lead to innovative approaches for managing α-synucleinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Precisely assessing an individual's immune age is critical for developing targeted aging interventions. Although traditional methods for evaluating biological age, such as the use of cellular senescence markers and physiological indicators, have been widely applied, these methods inherently struggle to capture the full complexity of biological aging. We propose the concept of an 'immunosenescence clock' that evaluates immune system changes on the basis of changes in immune cell abundance and omics data (including transcriptome and proteome data), providing a complementary indicator for understanding age-related physiological transformations. Rather than claiming to definitively measure biological age, this approach can be divided into a biological age prediction clock and a mortality prediction clock. The main function of the biological age prediction clock is to reflect the physiological state through the transcriptome data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), whereas the mortality prediction clock emphasizes the ability to identify people at high risk of mortality and disease. We hereby present nearly all of the immunosenescence clocks developed to date, as well as their functional differences. Critically, we explicitly acknowledge that no single diagnostic test can exhaustively capture the intricate changes associated with biological aging. Furthermore, as these biological functions are based on the acceleration or delay of immunosenescence, we also summarize the factors that accelerate immunosenescence and the methods for delaying it. A deep understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of immunosenescence can help establish more accurate immune-age models, providing support for personalized longevity interventions and improving quality of life in old age.",

    "abstract": "Pathological tau is suggested to play a role in cognitive deterioration in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease. We investigated cross-sectional associations of tau burden with episodic and semantic memory performance in older adults without dementia. A systematic search in MEDLINE (via PubMed), PsychINFO, and Embase resulted in 24 eligible studies for meta-analysis. Tau burden was assessed using CSF, PET, or histopathological measures. All studies evaluated associations of tau with episodic memory: weighted effect sizes were -0.46 (95 % CI [-0.73; -0.20], p < .001) for episodic composite scores, -0.19 ([-0.36; -0.03], p = .024) for delayed word list recall, and -0.05 ([-0.14; 0.04], p = .257) for logical memory. Fourteen studies evaluated associations of tau with semantic memory: weighted effect sizes were -0.28 ([-0.52; -0.04], p = .023) for semantic composite scores, -0.06 ([-0.16; 0.03], p = .194) for semantic fluency, and 0.06 ([-0.06; 0.18], p = .319) for picture naming. Our findings indicate that tau burden related to both episodic and semantic memory impairment in older individuals without a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or manifest dementia, with episodic composite scores showing the strongest association with tau burden. Future potential lies in developing more sensitive scores to detect this subtle cognitive impairment, which could contribute to early identification of individuals in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease, thereby improving early diagnosis and timely intervention.",

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been postulated as an early marker of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) but it can also be associated to other non-AD pathologies such as Vascular Dementia (VaD). Nevertheless, there is scarce data about SCD as a potential harbinger of cerebrovascular pathology. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the association between SCD and cerebrovascular damage measured by neuroimaging markers.This study was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted in 3 databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) from origin to December 8th, 2021. Primary studies including cognitively unimpaired adults with SCD and neuroimaging markers of cerebrovascular damage (i.e., white matter signal abnormalities, WMSA) were selected. Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis of studies with a case-control design was performed.Of 241 articles identified, 21 research articles were selected. Eight case-control studies were included for the meta-analysis. A significant overall effect-size was observed for the mean WMSA burden in SCD relative to controls, where the WMSA burden was higher in SCD.Our findings show the potential usefulness of SCD as a harbinger of cerebrovascular disease in cognitively healthy individuals. Further research is needed in order to elucidate the role of SCD as a preclinical marker of vascular cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "With the intensification of population aging, the proportion of elderly breast cancer patients is continuously increasing, among which those with low HER2 expression account for approximately 45 %-55 % of all cases within traditional HER2-negative breast cancer. Concurrently, the significant therapeutic effect of T-DXd on patients with HER2-low tumors has brought this group into the public spotlight. Since the clinical approval of T-DXd in 2019, there has been a significant vertical surge in the volume of publications within this domain. We analyzed 512 articles on HER2-low breast cancer from the Web of Science Core Collection using bibliometrics, topic modeling, and knowledge graph techniques to summarize the current state and trends of research in this domain. Research efforts are particularly concentrated in the United States and China. Our analysis revealed six main research directions: HER2 detection, omics and clinical biomarkers, basic and translational research, neoadjuvant therapy and prognosis, progress of ADC drugs and clinical trials. To enhance the therapeutic efficacy and safety of antibodydrug conjugates (ADCs), researchers are actively exploring potential drug candidates other than T-DXd, with numerous ADC drugs emerging in clinical practice and trials. By incorporating emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy and employing circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection techniques, progress has been made toward improving the prognosis of patients with low HER2 expression. We believe that these research efforts hold promise as compelling evidence that HER2-low breast cancer may constitute a distinct and independent subtype.",

    "abstract": "Dementia has an impact on the quality of life (QoL) of people with dementia. Tailored services are crucial for improving their QoL. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer opportunities for personalised care, potentially delaying institutionalisation and enhancing QoL. However, AI's specific role in approaches to support QoL for people with dementia remains unclear. This scoping review aims to synthesise the scientific evidence and grey literature on how AI can support the QoL of people with dementia. Following Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar in January 2024. Studies on AI, QoL (using Lawton's four-domain QoL definition), and people with dementia across various care settings were included. Two reviewers conducted a two-stage screening, and a narrative synthesis identified common themes arising from the individual studies to address the research question. The search yielded 5.467 studies, after screening, thirty studies were included. Three AI categories were identified: monitoring systems, social robots, and AI approaches for performing activities of daily living. Most studies were feasibility studies, with little active involvement of people with dementia during the research process. Most AI-based approaches were monitoring systems targeting Lawton's behavioural competence (capacity for independent functioning) domain. This review highlights that AI applications for enhancing QoL in people with dementia are still in early development, with research largely limited to small-scale feasibility studies rather than demonstrating clinical effectiveness. While AI holds promise, further exploration and rigorous real-world validation are needed before AI can meaningfully impact the daily lives of people with dementia.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in healthcare and scientific research have shifted the perception of ageing from a period of decline to recognising its potential for sustained functional ability, well-being, and societal contributions. In light of this perspective, a multidisciplinary panel of experts from five European countries conducted a narrative review of the literature. It convened for a one-day consensus meeting to identify key barriers, facilitators, and research priorities related to healthy ageing. Thus, this paper aims to (1) define the concept of positive ageing, (2) discuss barriers and facilitators to healthy ageing, (3) examine the role of healthcare professionals in maintaining and improving intrinsic capacity, and (4) propose a research agenda to address gaps in healthy ageing. The panel identified 70 barriers and 64 facilitators, structured within the WHO's ICOPE framework, related to intrinsic capacity. Twenty-six interventions across five domains-locomotor, sensory, psychological, cognitive capacities, and vitality- were proposed, aimed at both frail and robust individuals, focusing on social integration, psychological well-being, physiological resilience, deficit management, and disorder prevention. The panel also outlined a research agenda emphasising AI-driven ageing support, improved communication strategies, early frailty detection, and the development of locally adapted guidelines and infrastructure for healthy and positive ageing. This framework emphasizes the importance of early-life interventions and advocates for a preventive, holistic, and multidisciplinary approach to aging. In conclusion, the MIPAG's fosters a proactive mindset and early interventions throughout life to prevent the decline and optimise intrinsic capacity.",

    "abstract": "The expression levels of telomerase exhibit regulatory heterogeneity across different cell types and various biological stages of cell development. The expression of telomerase is dynamically regulated across cell types and developmental stages, with its activity predominantly determined by the abundance of its catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). Telomerase levels are typically high in the pluripotent embryonic stem cells, germline cells, and cancer cells, and silenced in the terminally differentiated cells. Minimal telomerase activity is present in the stem and progenitor cells of highly proliferative tissues, although preventing telomere shortening is beyond common sense in the field of biology and cannot be achieved, eventually leading to replicative senescence. While telomerase silencing in somatic cells and adult stem cells acts as a barrier to tumorigenesis by limiting their lifespan, the eventual exhaustion of stem cell pools leads to tissue dysfunction and aging. Telomerase reactivation via telomerase overexpression represents a potential strategy to reverse stem cell aging and rejuvenate aged or dysfunctional tissues. In this review, we discuss the dynamics of telomere (length, activity, and expression level) in pluripotent and adult stem cells as well as their impact on aging. Notably, we have summarized the recent evidence in the application of mesenchymal stem cells immortalized through exogenous telomerase expression in regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Several strategies have emerged lately in response to the rapid increase in the aging population to enhance health and life span and manage aging challenges. Developing such strategies is imperative and requires an assessment of biological aging. Several aging clocks have recently been developed to measure biological aging and to assess the efficacy of longevity interventions. Biological age better reflects a person's actual age and is closely associated with health outcomes and time to mortality. Traditionally, most aging clocks assume that biological changes occur linearly over time. However, age-related changes do not necessarily follow a linear trajectory. Thus, \"Deep Aging Clocks\" have been developed to overcome previous clocks' limitations and better capture subtle changes that occur during aging. Here, we summarize the current deep aging clocks, including epigenetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, microbiome, and imaging based clocks for age prediction. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), utilizing deep learning techniques, have significantly enhanced the prediction of biological aging, and this would help improve aging clocks and accelerate efforts to reach longer and healthier lives.",

    "abstract": "Body-brain interaction (BBI) plays a critical role in coordinating the communication between peripheral organs and the brain, contributing to the comorbidity of metabolic disorders and neurological disorders. In the context of obesity, one of the key mediators driving systemic and neuroinflammatory responses is the soluble form of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which primarily signals through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) to regulate inflammation and cell death. In this review, we examine how TNF/TNFR1-mediated metabolic inflammation in obesity disrupts cellular homeostasis across multiple organ systems, including the brain. In peripheral tissues, TNF is overproduced and secreted by activated macrophages, leading to lipid dysmetabolism, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction in key cell types such as adipocytes and hepatocytes. Elevated circulating TNF also increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, enabling peripheral inflammatory mediators to infiltrate the brain and activate glial cells, thereby amplifying neuroinflammation. Within the brain, TNF induces metabolic and autolysosomal dysfunction in neurons, resulting in elevated reactive oxygen species, accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, and impaired insulin signaling, contributing collectively to neuronal death and the progression of neurodegeneration. We further highlight the metabolic-inflammatory crosstalk within the BBI as a potential therapeutic target, focusing on anti-inflammatory strategies that modulate TNF/TNFR1 signaling. Lastly, we provide future perspectives on the implications of body-brain axes, cell type-specific mechanisms, and disease comorbidities in the context of obesity.",

This review summarizes the latest findings on the mechanisms underlying PNDs, with a focus on microglial activation, interleukin imbalance, and NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. We further discuss how anesthesia and surgery impair synaptic plasticity by disrupting neurotransmitter systems, particularly GABAA and NMDA receptors. Additionally, we highlight the roles of epigenetic regulation and gut microbiota dysbiosis in sustaining neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits. Finally, we explore potential therapeutic strategies, including bioactive compounds and neuroprotective agents, offering new directions for the prevention and treatment of PNDs.",

While notable advances have been made in neurodegenerative disease biomarkers, whether or not the biomarkers discovered to date are useful for early diagnosis remains an open question. Additionally, the reliability of these biomarkers has been disappointing, due in part to the large dissimilarities between the tissues traditionally used to source biomarkers and primarily diseased neurons. In this article, we review the potential viability of atypical epigenetic and/or consequent transcriptional alterations (ETAs) as biomarkers of early-stage neurodegenerative disease, and present our perspectives on the discovery and practical use of such biomarkers in patient-derived neural samples using single-cell level analyses, thereby greatly enhancing the reliability of biomarker application.",

    "abstract": "Genetic causes for ageing are traditionally investigated within a species. Yet, the lifecycles of many organisms intersect. Additional evolutionary and genetic causes of ageing, external to a focal species/organism, may thus be overlooked. Here, we introduce the phrase and concept of age-distorters and its evidence. Age-distorters carry ageing interfering genes, used to manipulate the biological age of other entities upon which the reproduction of age-distorters relies, e.g. age-distorters bias the reproduction/maintenance trade-offs of cells/organisms for their own evolutionary interests. Candidate age-distorters include viruses, parasites and symbionts, operating through specific, genetically encoded interferences resulting from co-evolution and arms race between manipulative non-kins and manipulable species. This interference results in organismal ageing when age-distorters prompt manipulated organisms to favor their reproduction at the expense of their maintenance, turning these hosts into expanded disposable soma. By relying on reproduction/maintenance trade-offs affecting disposable entities, which are left ageing to the reproductive benefit of other physically connected lineages with conflicting evolutionary interests, the concept of age-distorters expands the logic of the Disposable Soma theory beyond species with fixed germen/soma distinctions. Moreover, acknowledging age-distorters as external sources of mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropic genes expands the scope of the mutation accumulation and of the antagonistic pleiotropy theories.",

Furthermore, a reference pangenome allows for the identification of previously undetected structural commonalities and differences among individuals, which may help in the diagnosis of a disease, support the prediction of what will happen over time (prognosis) and aid in developing novel treatments in the perspective of personalized medicine. Therefore, in the present review, the application of the pangenome concept to the study of neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed and analyzed for its potential to enable an improvement in diagnosis and prognosis for these illnesses, leading to the development of tailored treatments for individual patients from the knowledge of the genomic composition of a whole population.",

    "abstract": "Aging strongly affects the peripheral nervous system (PNS), triggering alterations that vary depending on the innervated tissue. The most frequent alteration in peripheral nerve aging is reduced nerve fiber and glial density which can lead to abnormal nerve functionality. Interestingly, the activation of a destructive phenotype takes place in macrophages across the PNS while a reduced number of neuronal bodies is a unique feature of some enteric ganglia. Single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing has unveiled a striking complexity of cell populations in the peripheral nerves, and these refined cell type annotations could facilitate a better understanding of PNS aging. While the effects of senescence on individual PNS cell types requires further characterization, the use of senolytics appears to improve general PNS function in models of aging. Here, we review the current understanding of age-related changes of the intracardiac, musculoskeletal, and enteric nervous system sub-sections of the PNS, highlighting their commonalities and differences.",

    "abstract": "The gradual decline in physiological functions that comes with aging contributes to a range of chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and osteoarthritis. Significant advancements in human longevity due to socioeconomic development have resulted in a foreseeable and substantial strain on the global healthcare system. In fact, there is now a shift in research focus towards enhancing healthspan. As a result, the development of improved therapies for various chronic diseases is essential to enhance healthspan in the aging population. Adiponectin, mainly produced in adipose tissue, is found at elevated levels in the blood of healthy centenarians. In contrast, lower circulating levels of adiponectin are inversely associated with the occurrence and severity of several age-related complications. Adiponectin plays a crucial role in promoting beneficial effects on key biological processes associated with aging-related diseases, contributing to improved healthspan and lifespan in preclinical models. In recent years, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have garnered significant research interest due to their crucial role in both local paracrine signaling and systemic inter-organ communication. They are now widely recognized for their potential as valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tools. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the pathophysiological roles of adiponectin and EVs in aging, emphasizing their combined therapeutic potential in age-related diseases. Additionally, we explore the emerging evidence of crosstalk between adiponectin and EVs, underscoring their potential for developing improved strategies to promote healthy aging and longevity.",

    "abstract": "The aging population worldwide necessitates the development of novel therapeutics that enhance the quality of life by preventing and treating age-related diseases. In this review, we first discuss the advantages of a dual-purpose target identification strategy for aging and age-related diseases, with assessment of the hallmark of aging as an approach to identify such dual-purpose targets. Resulting from a convergence of aging research with machine learning (ML) and other artificial intelligence (AI) models, aging clocks were initially developed as aging biomarkers, but its value in identifying therapeutic targets is also increasingly recognized. Building on recently published aging clocks, we reestablish a significant proportion of known drug targets by identifying clock-associated genes, highlighting the potential of these clocks for target identification. Lastly, we discuss other applications of aging clocks in drug development such as population stratification and disease and treatment monitoring. With the growing availability of multi-omics data and rapid advancements in ML and AI, we anticipate accelerated progress in aging clock research, paving the way for innovative treatments to meet the healthcare needs of a global aging population.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a systematic review of studies comparing the intensity of epigenetic ageing in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and uninfected individuals. We included studies that quantitatively examined the intensity of age-related epigenetic changes in both groups. We identified 25 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The results of the vast majority (22 out of 25) of the studies included in the review indicate the presence of accelerated epigenetic ageing in people living with HIV compared to uninfected individuals. Most studies reported evidence of epigenetic age acceleration in people living with HIV, both among those not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and those who were on ART treatment. However, the studies included in the review were conducted mostly on relatively small groups and using different methods. While several studies have carefully addressed confounding variables, others did not report adjustments for factors such as BMI, diabetes, HBV and HCV co-infections, or lifestyle influences, which may be especially relevant for interpreting second-generation epigenetic clocks such as GrimAge and PhenoAge. We believe that the results of our review indicate accelerated epigenetic ageing in people living with HIV compared to uninfected individuals. There is a need for further research, which will analyse material from different tissues and take into account a number of biomarkers and the mentioned confounding factors. Studies considering the impact of individual classes of antiretroviral drugs, the age of the patient at the time of HIV diagnosis, and the timeliness of diagnosis on epigenetic ageing are particularly needed.",

    "abstract": "Stroke prevention is one of the pillars of management in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), hence effective and safe anticoagulation strategies are needed. While available anticoagulants target coagulation factors involved in thrombus formation, their bleeding complications and limitations in aging populations underscore the necessity for novel agents. Factor XI/XIa (FXI/XIa), which selectively targets the intrinsic coagulation pathway, offers a promising approach by attenuating thrombin generation without impairing hemostasis. Various novel inhibitors, including antisense oligonucleotides, monoclonal antibodies and small molecules, have been developed. Clinical trials have shown favorable safety profiles with reduced bleeding risks compared to traditional anticoagulants. Some efficacy in preventing thromboembolic events has also been demonstrated, with ongoing trials further evaluating long-term safety and efficacy. This narrative review explores the potential of FXI/XIa inhibitors as a novel anticoagulant approach for AF. We discuss the rationale, pharmacology, evidence and future directions to assess the application prospects of FXI/XIa inhibitors in elderly AF patients, highlighting their potential to improve anticoagulation therapy by decoupling thrombosis prevention from bleeding complications.",

It is characterized by persistent DNA damage responses, chromatin reorganization, and the secretion of a complex mixture of cytokines and proteases collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Transcriptomic and proteomic studies have defined key markers, including CDKN2A, CDKN1A, TP53, and SASP factors, but these approaches provide only static inventories. They do not explain how regulatory programs are executed through protein interactions that assemble, dissolve, and reorganize over time. Interactomics now fills this gap. Advances such as affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), proximity labeling (BioID/TurboID), and cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) reveal that senescence is driven not by single molecules but by the rewiring of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). These dynamic networks stabilize DNA damage response hubs, restructure chromatin and the nuclear lamina, regulate SASP secretion, and remodel metabolism. By integrating interactomic data with transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, it is now possible to uncover therapeutic vulnerabilities and guide the design of senolytics, senomorphics, and strategies that block senescence escape. Important challenges remain. Weak or transient interactions are often lost, background signals can obscure specificity, and membrane complexes are under-represented. Emerging single-cell and spatial technologies are beginning to overcome these limitations, revealing how senescence differs across tissues, contexts, and disease states. In essence, senescence is not just a change in gene expression but a reorganization of the cell's communication networks. Interactomics offers the framework needed to decode this complexity and to design precision therapies for aging and age-related disease.",

    "abstract": "Over the past several decades, high-resolution brain imaging, blood and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and other advanced technologies have changed diagnosis from an exercise depending primarily on the history and physical examination to a computer- and online resource-aided process that relies on larger and larger quantities of data. In addition, randomized controlled trials (RCT) at a population level have led to many new drugs and devices to treat neurological disease, including disease-modifying therapies. We are now at a crossroads. Combinatorially profound increases in data about individuals has led to an alternative to population-based RCTs. Genotyping and comprehensive \"deep\" phenotyping can sort individuals into smaller groups, enabling precise medical decisions at a personal level. In neurology, precision medicine that includes prediction, prevention and personalization requires that genomic and phenomic information further incorporate imaging and behavioral data. In this article, we review the genomic, phenomic, and computational aspects of precision medicine for neurology. After defining biological markers, we discuss some applications of these \"-omic\" and neuroimaging measures, and then outline the role of computation and ultimately brain simulation. We conclude the article with a discussion of the relation between precision medicine and value-based care.",

    "abstract": "This concise review provides new perspectives on systemic reduction of tissue aging by comparing different strategies, such as heterochronic parabiosis, injections of young blood plasma, neutral blood exchange (NBE) and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Unlike previous literature that primarily discusses the need for young blood factors, we emphasize the potential of diluting age-elevated proteins as the way to re-calibrate systemic proteome to its younger state without donor blood. Furthermore, we introduce modulation of proteome noise, as an important part of understanding tissue aging and as a critical mechanism for tissue rejuvenation. We discuss studies on the dominance of aged systemic milieu in promoting progeric phenotypes in young cells, in vitro, and in multiple tissues of young animals, in vivo. We support our arguments with evidence showing a significant age-related increase in protein synthesis, in noise of newly synthesized proteomes, and in the rapid induction of these aging phenotypes in young muscle by exposure to aged tissue. We summarize the significance of these findings for future research on aging and longevity.",

Since depression is consistently associated with low vitamin D levels as well as several adverse health outcomes, vitamin D supplementation may be especially relevant for depressed persons. This review examines the potential benefits of vitamin D for (somatic) health outcomes in randomised controlled supplementation trials for depression. Systematic literature search to assess whether adverse health outcomes, such as frailty, falls, or cognitive functioning, were included in vitamin D supplementation trials for depression, and whether these outcomes were affected by supplementation. The revised Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials was used. Thirty-one trials were included. Adverse health outcomes were considered in five studies. Two studies reported some beneficial effect on an adverse health outcome. While depressed persons are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, supplementation trials hardly addressed the common negative health consequences of low vitamin D levels as secondary outcome measures. Well-designed trials of the effects of vitamin D supplementation in late-life depression should explore whether adverse health outcomes can be prevented or stabilised, and whether depression benefits from this improvement.",

As they assessed different dimensions, is important to inform about the content and psychometric properties to guide the decisions when selecting and implementing them in practice. This systematic review provides a comprehensive insight on the strengths and weaknesses of the CGAs used in long-term care settings and community care. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science Core Collection. Studies published up to July 13, 2021, were considered. Quality appraisal was performed for the included studies. A total of 10 different CGAs were identified from 71 studies included. Three instruments were reported for long-term care settings, and seven for community care. The content was not homogenous and differed in terms of the detail and clearness of the areas being evaluated. Evidence for good to excellent validity and reliability was reported for various instruments. Setting more specific and clear domains, associated to the special needs of the care setting, could improve informed decisions at the time of selecting and implementing a CGA. Considering the amount and quality of the evidence, the instrument development trajectory, the validation in different languages, and availability in different care settings, we recommend the interRAI LTCF and interRAI HC to be used for long-term facilities and community care.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to pesticides is a risk factor for various diseases, yet its association with biological aging remains unclear. We aimed to systematically investigate the relationship between pesticide exposure and biological aging. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched from inception to August 2023. Observational studies investigating the association between pesticide exposure and biomarkers of biological aging were included. Three-level random-effect meta-analysis was used to synthesize the data. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Twenty studies evaluating the associations between pesticide exposure and biomarkers of biological aging in 10,368 individuals were included. Sixteen reported telomere length and four reported epigenetic clocks. Meta-analysis showed no statistically significant associations between pesticide exposure and the Hannum clock (pooled β = 0.27; 95%CI: -0.25, 0.79), or telomere length (pooled Hedges'g = -0.46; 95%CI: -1.10, 0.19). However, the opposite direction of effect for the two outcomes showed an indication of possible accelerated biological aging. After removal of influential effect sizes or low-quality studies, shorter telomere length was found in higher-exposed populations. The existing evidence for associations between pesticide exposure and biological aging is limited due to the scarcity of studies on epigenetic clocks and the substantial heterogeneity across studies examining telomere length. High-quality studies incorporating more biomarkers of biological aging, focusing more on active chemical ingredients of pesticides and accounting for potential confounders are needed to enhance our understanding of the impact of pesticides on biological aging.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive decline is a natural consequence of aging, but several genetic, environmental, and psychological factors can influence its trajectories. Among the most enduring factors, the Big Five personality traits - defined as relatively stable tendencies to think, behave, and react to the environment - can influence both directly (e.g., by physiological correlates) and indirectly (e.g., healthy or risky behaviors) the risk of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - a preclinical form of cognitive decline. Despite the great amount of studies focusing on the relationship between personality and cognitive decline, an updated systematic synthesis of the results including a broader range of study designs is still lacking. This systematic review aims to summarize the findings of studies investigating: (i) differences in personality traits between groups of healthy individuals and those with MCI, (ii) the impact of personality traits on the risk for both MCI and dementia, and (iii) changes in personality traits among individuals progressing from normal cognition to MCI. Neuroticism emerged as a significant risk factor for MCI and dementia; Conscientiousness and Openness appear to offer protection against dementia and moderate cognitive decline. Overall, these findings suggest a pivotal role of personality structure in shaping cognitive outcomes on the long run.",
