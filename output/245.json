    "abstract": "Abstract Three dimensional (3D) woven composites have attracted the interest of academia and industry thanks to their damage tolerance characteristics and automated fabric manufacturing. Although much research has been conducted to investigate their out-of-plane “through thickness” properties, still their in-plane properties are not fully understood and rely on extensive experimentation. To date, the literature lacks an inclusive summary of the mechanical characterisation for 3D woven composites. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the available research studies on 3D woven composites mechanical characterisation, with less emphasis on the out-of-plane response, but an in-depth review of the in-plane response “un-notched vs. notched”. The paper highlights the knowledge gap in the literature of 3D woven composites, suggesting opportunities for future research in this field and a room for improvement in utilising Non-Destructive Techniques (NDT), such as Digital Image Correlation (DIC), Acoustic Emission (AE) and X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), for observing damage initiation and evolution in 3D woven composites that could be used to calibrate and evaluate analytical and numerical models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Now-a-days, newer hardened steel materials are coming rapidly into the market due to its wide applications in various fields of engineering. So the machinability investigation of these steel materials is one of the prime concern for practicing engineers, prior to actual machining. Methods The present study addresses surface roughness, flank wear and chip morphology during dry hard turning of AISI 4340 steel (49 HRC) using CVD (TiN/TiCN/Al 2 O 3 /TiN) multilayer coated carbide tool. Three factors (cutting speed, feed and depth of cut) and three-level factorial experiment designs with Taguchi’s L 9 Orthogonal array (OA) and statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to investigate the consequent effect of these cutting parameters on the tool and workpiece in terms of flank wear and surface roughness. For better understanding of the cutting process, surface topography of machined workpieces, wear mechanisms of worn coated carbide tool and chip morphology of generated chips were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Consequently, multiple regression analysis was adopted to develop mathematical model for each response, along with various diagnostic tests were performed to check the validity and efficacy of the proposed model. Finally, to justify the economical feasibility of coated carbide tool in hard turning application, a cost analysis was performed based on Gilbert’s approach by evaluating the tool life under optimized cutting condition (suggested by response optimization technique). Results The results shows that surface roughness and flank wear are statistically significant influenced by feed and cutting speed. In fact, increase in cutting speed resulted in better surface finish as well as increase in flank wear. Tool wear describes the gradual failure of cutting tool, caused grooves by abrasion due to rubbing effect of flank land with hard particles in the machined surface and high cutting temperature. Chip morphology confirms the formation of saw-tooth type of chip with severity of chip serration due to cyclic crack propagation caused by plastic deformation. The total machining cost per part is found to be $0.13 (i.e. in Indian rupees Rs. 8.21) for machining of hardened AISI 4340 steel with coated carbide tool. Conclusions From the study, the effectiveness and potential of multilayer TiN/TiCN/Al 2 O 3 /TiN coated carbide tool for hard turning process during dry cutting condition possesses high yielding and cost-effective benefit to substitute the traditional cylindrical grinding operation. Apart, it also contributes reasonable option to costlier CBN and ceramic tools.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The theory of linear elasticity is insufficient at small length scales, e.g., when dealing with micro-devices. In particular, it cannot predict the “size effect” observed at the micro- and nanometer scales. In order to design at such small scales an improvement of the theory of elasticity is necessary, which is referred to as strain gradient elasticity . Methods There are various approaches in literature, especially for small deformations. In order to include geometric nonlinearities we start by discussing the necessary balance equations. Then we present a generic approach for obtaining adequate constitutive equations. By combining balance equations and constitutive relations nonlinear field equations result. We apply a variational formulation to the nonlinear field equations in order to find a weak form, which can be solved numerically by using open-source codes. Results By using balances of linear and angular momentum we obtain the so-called stress and couple stress as tensors of rank two and three, respectively. Since dealing with tensors an adequate representation theorem can be applied. We propose for an isotropic material a stress with two and a couple stress with three material parameters. For understanding their impact during deformation the numerical solution procedure is performed. By successfully simulating the size effect known from experiments, we verify the proposed theory and its numerical implementation. Conclusion Based on representation theorems a self consistent strain gradient theory is presented, discussed, and implemented into a computational reality .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Finite element is an effective tool to simulate stent expansion inside stenotic arteries, which provides an insightful understanding of the biomechanical behaviour of the whole stent-artery system during the procedure. The choice of balloon type, system constraint and artery constitutive model plays an important role in finite element simulation of stent deployment. Methods Commercial finite element package ABAQUS was used to model the expansion of Xience stent inside a diseased artery with 40% stenosis. The arterial wall, consisting of intima, media and adventitia layers, and the stenotic plaque were described by different hyperelastic models. Both folded and rubber balloons were considered and inflated with a linearly increasing pressure of 1.4 MPa. Simulations were also carried out by considering free, partially and fully constrained arteries. Results Folded balloon produces sustained stent expansion under a lower pressure when compared to rubber balloon, leading to increased stress level and enhanced final expansion for the system. Fully constrained artery reduces the stent expansion when compared to free and partially constrained arteries, due to the increased recoiling effect. Stress in the artery-plaque system has higher magnitude for stent expansion in a free artery due to more severe stretch. Calcified plaque limits stent expansion considerably when compared to hypocellular plaque. The negligence of the second stretch invariant in the strain energy potential leads to the disappearance of saturation behaviour during stent expansion. The use of anisotropic artery model reduces the system expansion at peak pressure when compared to the isotropic model, but with an increased final diameter due to reduced recoiling effect. The stress distribution in the artery-plaque system is also different for different combinations of artery and plaque constitutive models. Conclusions Folded balloon should be used in the simulation of stent deployment, with the artery partially constrained using spring elements with a proper stiffness constant. The blood vessel should be modelled as a three-layer structure using a hyperelastic potential that considers both the first and second stretch invariants as well as the anisotropy. The composition of the plaque also has to be considered due to its major effect on stent deployment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is a well-established non-conventional machining process for the machining of electrically conductive and difficult-to-machine materials. But its applications are limited because of the slow machining rate and poor surface finish. Powder mixed EDM (PMEDM) is unitary of the recent progresses in the EDM process in which powder particles mixed in the dielectric fluid results in higher machining rate and better surface quality. In the past, limited work has been found on PMEDM of Inconel-800 material. Researchers have reported about machining with different powder particles like aluminum powder, silicon carbide, graphite etc. in the dielectric fluid of EDM, but the effect of powder particles, i.e. Tungsten carbide, cobalt and boron carbide along with tool material i.e. copper, copper-chromium and graphite on Inconel-800 material has not been explored. The purpose of the present work is to look into the issue of tool material (Cu, copper-chromium, and graphite) along with powder particles (tungsten carbide, cobalt and boron carbide) suspended in EDM oil on Inconel-800 material. Methods The present work includes optimization of Material Removal Rate (MRR) and Tool Wear Rate (TWR) for the machining of Inconel-800 material using Powder Mixed Elctric Discharge Machining (PMEDM). Different input parameters such as peak current, pulse on-time, pulse off-time, tool and powder materials along with effect of three micro powder particles, i.e. tungsten carbide, cobalt and boron carbide and three electrodes i.e. copper, copper-chromium, and graphite have been considered for the experimentation. The box-Behnken method of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been used for designing the experiments along with the Desirability Approach for multiple response parameters optimization. The adequacy of the proposed mathematical models have also been tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Microstructure analysis and transfer of different factors on the machined surface has also been investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) and X - Ray Diffraction (XRD). Results The results showed that peak current, pulse on-time, and tool material significantly affects the Material Removal Rate (MRR) while peak current, pulse on-time, tool material and powder materials affected the Tool Wear Rate (TWR). Pulse off-time has a trifling effect on both MRR and TWR, while powder particles on MRR. From desirability approach, the optimal combination of parameters found to be current 1 amp, pulse on-time 0.98 μs, pulse off-time 0.03 μs, tool material 0.31 and the powder (suspended particles) 0.64. Conclusion The analysis of the experimental observations highlights that the current, pulse on-time and tool material have found to be the most decisive factors for MRR, while current, pulse on-time, tool material and powder particles for TWR.",

Methods Graphene nanosheets (GNSs) have been incorporated into an aluminium matrix composite using mechanical milling and hot pressing in the current study. Results The SEM observation shows that aluminium particles are firstly flattened into flakes, and then fractured/ rewelded into equiaxed particles as the ball milling progresses. The crystalline size is decreased and the lattice strain is increased during the ball milling, which are also intensified by the added GNSs. The hardness of the composite is increased by 115.1% with the incorporation of 1.0 vol. % GNSs. Conclusions The local stress induced by the hard GNSs accelerates the milling process. The X-Ray diffraction patterns show that the intensity ratio of (111) to (200) can reflect the preferred orientation of the particle mixture, and the evolution of I(111)/I(200) agrees well with the observed results using SEM. The increased hardness is mainly attributed to the refined microstructure and Orowan strengthening.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Significant amount of research, both experimental and numerical, has been conducted to study the mechanical behaviour of biodegradable polymer PL(L)A due to its wide range of applications. However, mechanical brittleness or poor elongation of PL(L)A has limited its applications considerably, particularly in the biomedical field. This study aims to study the potential in improving the ductility of PLA by blending with PBS in varied weight ratios. Methods The preparation of PLA and PBS blends, with various weight ratios, was achieved by melting and mixing technique at high temperature using HAAKE™ Rheomix OS Mixer. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was applied to investigate the melting behaviour, crystallization and miscibility of the blends. Small dog-bone specimens, produced by compression moulding, were used to test mechanical properties under uniaxial tension. Moreover, an advanced viscoplastic model with nonlinear hardening variables was applied to simulate rate-dependent plastic deformation of PLA/PBS blends, with model parameters calibrated simultaneously against the tensile test data. Results Optical Microscopy showed that PBS composition aid with the crystallization of PLA. The elongation of PLA/PBS blends increased with the increase of PBS content, but with a compromise of tensile modulus and strength. An increase of strain rate led to enhanced stress response, demonstrating the time-dependent deformation nature of the material. Model simulations of time-dependent plastic deformation for PLA/PBS blends compared well with experimental results. Conclusions The crystallinity of PLA/PBS blends increased with the addition of PBS content. The brittleness of pure PLA can be improved by blending with ductile PBS using mechanical mixing technique, but with a loss of stiffness and strength. The tensile tests at different strain rates confirmed the time-dependent plastic deformation nature of the blends, i.e., viscoplasticity, which can be simulated by the Chaboche viscoplastic model with nonlinear hardening variables.",

Methods The effects of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on the physical properties of polar acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) and non-polar Ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer rubber (EPDM) matrix have been investigated and their properties compared. NBR vulcanizates exhibited higher cure rates compared to the EPDM systems. Results Effective dispersion of the nanosheets within the different matrices was observed to be a reason for the improvement in properties, but the effective nanosheets-matrix interactions played a key role in reinforcing action. This was noticeable in the various properties (crosslinking density, tensile properties, and dynamical mechanical analysis) evaluated. Typically, the polar NBR matrix was observed to show about 461 and 405% higher interactions parameter with GO and rGO fillers (loaded from 0.1~1phr) than composites of EPDM based on Kraus model.

    "abstract": "Abstract Green manufacturing demands least wastage. Minimum chip formation reduces adverse effect on environment. Nose radius has a major role in reducing development of chips. Selection of proper nose radius and machining parameters will reduce amount of chip, therefore protect the environment. In finish turning of Al alloy-SiC, nose radius wear mainly affect the surface feature of the final product. It is owing to the direct contact between the area of tool nose and the SiC particles during turning. This paper is focused on influence of tool nose radius and machining parameters on surface quality of AA7075/15 wt.% SiC (20 - 40 μm) composites and tool life of tungsten carbide inserts while dry turning. Response surface method (RSM) was utilized to find the roughness and tool life under numerous turning situations. Considering the single objective optimization of turning parameters, minimum roughness of 2.088 μm, was achieved at nose radius of 1.2 mm and maximum tool life of 6.72 min, was obtained at nose radius of 0.4 mm. Multi objective optimization by desirability analysis for minimum roughness and the maximum life of tool has shown that suitable value of nose radius is 0.4 mm. Multi objective optimization of both roughness of surface and life of tool results in 1.81% increase in surface roughness and 10.11% decrease in tool life. Abrasion was mainly found to be responsible for wear of tungsten carbide inserts, while turning of AA7075/15 wt.% SiC (20 - 40 μm) composites. Novelty of this research work is that so far no one has investigated impact of nose radius and machining parameters on surface roughness, tool wear and tool life during turning of AA7075/15 wt.% SiC composites.

There exist already some models which count on this effect. They are, however, phenomenological and need a fitted model parameter. In this paper, a micromechanically-based constitutive law is proposed which considers the flow-induced anisotropic viscosity of the fiber suspension. Methods The introduced viscosity tensor can handle arbitrary anisotropy of the fluid-fiber suspension which depends on the actual fiber orientation distribution. Assuming incompressible material behaviour, a homogenization method for unidirectional structures in contribution with orientation averaging is used to determine the effective viscosity tensor. The motion of rigid ellipsoidal fibers induced by the flow of the matrix material is described based on Jeffery’s equation. The reorientation of the fibers is modeled in two ways: by describing them with fiber orientation vectors, and by fiber orientation tensors. A numerical implementation of the introduced model is applied to representative flow modes. Results The predicted effective stress values depending on the actual fiber orientation distribution through the anisotropic viscosity are analyzed in transient and stationary flow cases. In the case of the assumed incompressibility, they show similar effective viscous material behaviour as the results obtained by the use of the Dinh-Armstrong constitutive law. Conclusions The introduced model is a possible way to describe the flow-induced anisotropic viscosity of a fluid-fiber suspension based on the mean field theory.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of matrix cracking on the mechanical properties of FRP laminates with various off-axis angles, and to provide a critical test for an analytical solution using variational stress analysis. Methods Carbon and glass fiber reinforced polymer laminates (CFRP and GFRP) are tested. FRP prepregs are cured by using autoclave method to form laminates with layups [ θ m / φ n ] s . The laminates are then loaded monotonically and cyclically to obtain their mechanical properties and the effect of matrix cracks on the properties. Some of the effects include reduction of laminates’ stiffness and residual strains after unloading. In order to obtain higher crack densities in specimens, artificial cracks method was introduced in this study, where notches were made at the edges of some specimens before tested in tension. Cracks observation for CFRP laminates is done by using the X-ray technique, while for GFRP laminates a DSLR camera is used. Results The measured stiffness reduction as a function of the crack density is compared to an analytical prediction for cracked angle-ply laminates based on a variational stress analysis.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Wire Electrical discharge machining (WEDM) has higher capability for cutting complex shapes with high precision for very hard materials without using high cost of cutting tools. During the WEDM process, the wire behaves like a metal string, straightened by two axial pulling forces and deformed laterally by a sum of forces from the discharge process. Major forces acting on the wire can be classified into three categories. The first is a tensile force, pulling the wire from both sides in axial direction and keeping it straight. The second is the dielectric flushing force that comes from circulation of the dielectric fluid in the machining area. The third category consists of forces of different kinds resulting from sparking and discharging. Large amplitude of wire vibration leads to large kerf widths, low shape accuracies, rough machined surfaces, low cutting speeds and high risk of wire breakage. Such tendencies for poor machining performance due to wire instability behavior appear with thinner wires. Methods The present work investigates a mathematical modeling solution for correlating the interactive and higher order influences of various parameters affecting wire vibration during the WEDM process through response surface methodology (RSM). The adequacy of the above proposed model has been tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results Optimal combination of machining parameters such as wire tension, wire running speed, flow rate and servo voltage parameters has been obtained to minimize wire vibration. Conclusions The analysis of the experimental observations highlights that the wire tension, wire running speed, flow rate and servo voltage in WEDM greatly affect average wire vibration and kerf width.",

In this study, the precise second- and third-order elastic constants of polycrystalline steels were measured under adiabatic and isothermal conditions. Method To measure the minute change in the propagation time of the elastic wave corresponding to the tensile stress, the uniform and isotropic specimens were processed with high precision, the measuring instruments were strictly calibrated, and the temperature of the measurement chamber was kept constant. The author proposes an experimental formula to obtain the third-order elastic constants of steels. The stress dependent coefficients α ij in this formula are absolutely necessary to obtain the third-order elastic constants. Results The obtained stress dependent coefficients clearly indicated that there is a special relationship between the directions of stress and that of the oscillation of the elastic wave. When the frequency direction of the elastic wave matched the direction of the applied stress, α ij became a larger negative value. Lamè constants and Murnaghan’s third-order elastic constants ℓ , m,n were obtained for four types of steels. Conclusions The second- and third-order elastic constants under adiabatic conditions were smaller than those under isothermal conditions. Oscillation of crystal lattice is nonlinear and this is observed as the third-order elastic constants. Therefore, it is possible to obtain the knowledge on the internal stress and the thermal properties of the materials. This is also the basis of theoretical discussion of the thermal expansion coefficients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stents are commonly used in medical procedures to alleviate the symptoms of coronary heart disease, a prevalent modern society disease. These structures are employed to maintain vessel patency and restore blood flow. Traditionally stents are made of metals such as stainless steel or cobalt chromium; however, these scaffolds have known disadvantages. An emergence of transient scaffolds is gaining popularity, with the structure engaged for a required period whilst healing of the diseased arterial wall occurs. Polymers dominate a medical device sector, with incorporation in sutures, scaffolds and screws. Thanks to their good mechanical and biological properties and their ability to degrade naturally. Polylactic acid is an extremely versatile polymer, with its properties easily tailored to applications. Its dominance in the stenting field increases continually, with the first polymer scaffold gaining FDA approval in 2016. Still some challenges with PLLA bioresorbable materials remain, especially with regard to understanding their mechanical response, assessment of its changes with degradation and comparison of their performance with that of metallic drug-eluting stent. Currently, there is still a lack of works on evaluating both the pre-degradation properties and degradation performance of these scaffolds. Additionally, there are no established material models incorporating non-linear viscoelastic behaviour of PLLA and its evolution with in-service degradation. Assessing these features through experimental analysis accompanied by analytical and numerical studies will provide powerful tools for design and optimisation of these structures endorsing their broader use in stenting. This overview assesses the recent studies investigating mechanical and computational performance of poly(l-lactic) acid and its use in stenting applications.",

This paper presents an integrated FEM-ANN approach to compute accurate value of bend angle during laser bending process. Methods Initially, a finite element method (FEM) based three-dimensional nonlinear transient thermo-mechanical numerical model is developed using ABAQUS package. Using FEM model and data obtained in actual experiments, the proper values of absorptivity for various sets of process conditions are computed by inverse analysis technique. Based on the proper values of absorptivity, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is developed for accurate and quick prediction of absorptivity for given input process conditions. The predicted absorptivity is then employed in the FEM model for accurate computation of bend angle. Results The performance of the integrated approach is verified by conducting experiments. Conclusion The verification results showed that the proposed approach is able to compute the bend angle with a very good accuracy (average prediction error of 4.14 %).

    "abstract": "Abstract Composites reinforced with woven or braided textiles exhibit high structural stability and excellent damage tolerance thanks to yarn interlacing. With their high stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight ratios, braided composites are attractive for aerospace and automotive components as well as sports protective equipment. In these potential applications, components are typically subjected to multi-directional static, impact and fatigue loadings. To enhance material analysis and design for such applications, understanding mechanical behaviour of braided composites and development of predictive capabilities becomes crucial. Significant progress has been made in recent years in development of new modelling techniques allowing elucidation of static and dynamic responses of braided composites. However, because of their unique interlacing geometric structure and complicated failure modes, prediction of damage initiation and its evolution in components is still a challenge. Therefore, a comprehensive literature analysis is presented in this work focused on a review of the state-of-the-art progressive damage analysis of braided composites with finite-element simulations. Recently models employed in the studies on mechanical behaviour, impact response and fatigue analyses of braided composites are presented systematically. This review highlights the importance, advantages and limitations of as-applied failure criteria and damage evolution laws for yarns and composite unit cells. In addition, this work provides a good reference for future research on FE simulations of braided composites.",

Even though copper is face centered cubic it has significant mechanical anisotropy depending on the crystallographic orientations. Copper metal lines in integrated circuits are polycrystalline and typically have lognormal grain size distribution. The polycrystalline microstructure is known to impact the reliability and must be considered in modeling for better understanding of the failure mechanisms. Methods In this work, we used Voronoi tessellation to model the polycrystalline microstructure with lognormal grainsize distribution for the copper metal lines in test structures. Each of the grains is then assigned an orientation with distinct probabilistic texture and corresponding anisotropic elastic constants based on the assigned orientation. The test structure is then subjected to a thermal stress. Results A significant variation in hydrostatic stresses at the grain boundaries is observed by subjecting the test structure to thermal stress due to the elastic anisotropy of copper. This introduces new weak points within the metal interconnects leading to failure. Conclusions Inclusion of microstructures and corresponding anisotropic properties for copper grains is crucial to conduct a realistic study of stress voiding, hillock formation, delamination, and electromigration phenomena, especially at smaller nodes where the anisotropic effects are significant.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Nickel-based superalloys are typically used as blades and discs in the hot section of gas turbine engines, which are subjected to cyclic loading at high temperature during service. Understanding fatigue crack deformation and growth in these alloys at high temperature is crucial for ensuring structural integrity of gas turbines. Methods Experimental studies of crack growth were carried out for a three-point bending specimen subjected to fatigue at 725°C. In order to remove the influence of oxidation which can be considerable at elevated temperature, crack growth was particularly tested in a vacuum environment with a focus on dwell effects. For simulation, the material behaviour was described by a cyclic viscoplastic model with nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening rules, calibrated against test data. In combination with the extended finite element method (XFEM), the viscoplasticity model was further applied to predict crack growth under dwell fatigue. The crack was assumed to grow when the accumulated plastic strain ahead of the crack tip reached a critical value which was back calculated from crack growth test data in vacuum. Results Computational analyses of a stationary crack showed the progressive accumulation of strain near the crack tip under fatigue, which justified the strain accumulation criterion used in XFEM prediction of fatigue crack growth. During simulation, the crack length was recorded against the number of loading cycles, and the results were in good agreement with the experimental data. It was also shown, both experimentally and numerically, that an increase of dwell period leads to an increase of crack growth rate due to the increased creep deformation near the crack tip, but this effect is marginal when compared to the dwell effects under fatigue-oxidation conditions. Conclusion The strain accumulation criterion was successful in predicting both the path and the rate of crack growth under dwell fatigue. This work proved the capability of XFEM, in conjunction with advanced cyclic viscoplasticity model, for predicting crack growth in nickel alloys at elevated temperature, which has significant implication to gas turbine industries in terms of “damage tolerance” assessment of critical turbine discs and blades.",

It can also be used to evaluate the influence of a given variable, or set of variables, on viscoelastic properties. In this research, the effects of time, temperature, fiber volume fraction and the relative crystallinity of polyamide (PA) and glass fiber-reinforced polyamide (GFRPA) were investigated using the time-temperature superposition principle to estimate viscoelastic behavior under each set of conditions. Methods The crystallinities of PA and GFRPA, which ranged from 33 to 45%, were controlled by adjusting the duration of crystallization as 250 °C. Creep tests were carried out with these materials, and creep compliance curves of each condition were obtained. Results Using these creep compliance curves, the master curves for temperature, and the grand master curves for crystallinity and for fiber volume fraction were generated to show the relationships between fiber volume fraction, crystallinity, and viscoelastic parameters. Furthermore, the great-grand master curve for crystallinity and fiber volume fraction was generated to predict creep behavior in an arbitrarily condition. The predicted data were in good agreement with experimental results. Conclusions A method for estimating creep deformation taking into account the effects of influencing variables was developed. The time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP) was applied to the effects of the fiber volume fraction and crystallinity. Grand master curves for crystallinity and fiber volume fraction were obtained by shifting the corresponding master curves. This study demonstrates that the creep behaviors of fiber-reinforced plastics can be estimated using these shift factors and a great-grand master curve. This method yielded estimates of creep deformation that fitted well with experimental results. Based on our findings, it should be possible to control creep deformation in plastics or fiber-reinforced resins by controlling the fiber volume fraction and the crystallinity of the matrix material.",

As a result, analytical resin impregnation prediction showed good agreements with the experimental results in all the producing methods and molding conditions.

    "abstract": "Understanding of viscoelastic behaviour of a periodontal membrane under physiological conditions is important for many orthodontic problems. A new analytic model of a nearly incompressible viscoelastic periodontal ligament is suggested, employing symmetrical paraboloids to describe its internal and external surfaces.In the model, a tooth root is assumed to be a rigid body, with perfect bonding between its external surface and an internal surface of the ligament. An assumption of almost incompressible material is used to formulate kinematic relationships for a periodontal ligament; a viscoelastic constitutive equation with a fractional exponential kernel is suggested for its description.Translational and rotational equations of motion are derived for ligament's points and special cases of translational displacements of the tooth root are analysed. Material parameters of the fractional viscoelastic function are assessed on the basis of experimental data for response of the periodontal ligament to tooth translation. A character of distribution of hydrostatic stresses in the ligament caused by vertical and horizontal translations of the tooth root is defined.The proposed model allows generalization of the known analytical models of the viscoelastic periodontal ligament by introduction of instantaneous and relaxed elastic moduli, as well as the fractional parameter. The latter makes it possible to take into account different behaviours of the periodontal tissue under short- and long-term loads. The obtained results can be used to determine loads required for orthodontic tooth movements corresponding to optimal stresses, as well as to simulate bone remodelling on the basis of changes in stresses and strains in the periodontal ligament caused by such movements.",

This work offers a review of instruments of the statistics and the probability theory that are used for mechanical characterization of heterogeneous media with random positions of reinforcements.

It is also commonly used to produce near-net shaped preforms for advanced fibre reinforced composites.

The process starts from the definition of an analytical function which describes the movement of the carriers on a braiding track plate. Models of idealised Maypole-type braiding machines are built and used to shape virtual yarns into braids. This procedure can be used in a parameter control fashion, to optimise or to create virtual braided structures, which can serve as input for other structural analyses. It is emphasised that multiple cylinders are required for the modelling of a multifilament yarn to achieve better correlation with the experimental results. A parametric study is presented to investigate the effect of the number of virtual cylinders to represent a real yarn and the shape of the final braid. Excellent correlation was found between the virtual models and the experimental results when comparing the braid angle and yarn width.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The theory of microstretch elastic bodies was first developed by Eringen (1971, 1990, 1999, 2004). This theory was developed by extending the theory of micropolar elastcity. Each material point in this theory has three deformable directors. Methods The governing equations of a transversely isotropic microstretch material are specialized in x-z plane. Plane wave solutions of these governing equations results into a bi-quadratic velocity equation. The four roots of the velocity equation correspond to four coupled plane waves which are named as Coupled Longitudinal Displacement (CLD) wave, Coupled Longitudinal Microstretch (CLM) wave, Coupled Transverse Displacement (CTD) wave and Coupled Transverse Microrotational (CTM) wave. The reflection of Coupled Longitudinal Displacement (CLD) wave is considered at a stress-free surface of half-space of material. The appropriate displacement components, microrotation component and microstretch potential for incident and four reflected waves in half-space are formulated. These solutions for incident and reflected waves satisfy the boundary conditions at a stress free surface of half-space and we obtain a non-homogeneous system of four equations in four reflection coefficients (or amplitude ratios) along with Snell’s law for the present model. Results The speeds of plane waves are computed by Fortran program of bi-quadratic velocity equation for relevant physical constants of the material. The reflection coefficients of various reflected waves are also computed by Fortran program of Gauss elimination method. The speeds of plane waves are plotted against angle of propagation direction with vertical axis. The reflection coefficients of various reflected waves are plotted against the angle of incidence. These variations of speeds and reflection coefficients are also compared with those in absence of microstretch parameters. Conclusions For a specific material, numerical simulation in presence as well as in absence of microstretch shows that the coupled longitudinal displacement (CLD) wave is fastest wave and the coupled transverse microrotational (CTM) is observed slowest wave. The coupled longitudinal microstretch (CLM) wave is an additional wave due to the presence of microstretch in the medium. The presence of microstretch in transversely isotropic micropolar elastic solid affects the speeds of plane waves and the amplitude ratios of various reflected waves.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the last decades, the class of Ti-rich TiAl-based intermetallic materials has replaced many contemporary alloys till 900 °C. Due to higher oxidation resistance, 20% lower density and higher (about 150 °C more) operating temperature possibility of Al-rich TiAl alloys over Ti-rich side, phases from the Al-rich region of this alloy system are considered to be highly potential candidates for high temperature structural applications. Although there are a lot of works about Ti-rich alloys, however, investigation from the Al-rich side is very limited. This work reviews the class of Al-rich TiAl alloys in terms of phases, microstructures, morphology, deformation mechanisms, mechanical behaviors along with a possible micromechanical modeling approach. Single crystal like Ti-61.8at.%Al alloy from the Al-rich family has been chosen as an example for modeling high temperature anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry. A possible comparison with Ti-rich side is also presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The research is devoted to machining polymer composite materials and reflects a non-trivial, accuracy-affecting phenomenon that occurs while drilling polymer composite materials, i.e. reduction of holes diameter over time after processing. Methods The article contains experimental data obtained in the research of rheonomic shrinkage of holes after drilling various grades of polymer composite materials. The research involved using different types of tools (high-performance Ham solid carbide drill bits and diamond drill bits). The tests were carried out combining different parameters of drilling modes. We adopted the range of spindle speed change n = 10,000-20,000 rev/min and tool feed range S m = 50-300 mm/min. Measurements of shrinkage were performed with the help of ATOS III Triple Scan XL scanning system immediately after treatment and in 48 h thereafter. Based on the scanned polygonal mesh of each hole, three-dimensional models of holes drilled in the samples were built. Then, these models were verified against nominal drillings using GOM Inspect software. In this way, the values of rheonomic shrinkage were obtained. Verification was carried out according to Gaussian method of measurements by coincidence using variation variables sigma (Gaussian best-fit 3 sigma). Results Shrinkage of holes does not take place in structural materials. However, in polymer composite materials, shrinkage of the drilled hole of 10 mm nominal diameter may reach reduction in diameter of 0.02-0.03 mm during a period of 48 h and depends on the grade of the polymer composite material. Observations have shown that shrinkage also depends on machining mode parameters. Conclusions We have developed two hypotheses to explain the influence of processing mode parameters on rheonomic shrinkage: the first one relates to the rate of processing, the second – to the force factors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Glass and rubbery transitions under cooling and heating of polymeric materials underlie a shape memory effect, that is a material ability to save temporarily the deformed shape and restore the original one under the external influence. The present work aims to model the shape memory effect for an axially compressed polymeric rod in its post-buckled equilibrium state, which is the generalization of Euler’s elastica for a glassy material case. Methods For modeling, we use a new type of constitutive relations describing the thermomechanical behavior of amorphous polymers over a wide temperature range. To define the model parameters for lightly-linked epoxy resin a series of experiments was conducted using the Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer. Results Post-buckled states of an epoxy rod equilibrium during the temperature change have been found from numerical simulation. The obtained results illustrate the shape memory effect in case of axially compressed rod buckling. Conclusion The thermomechanical shape-memory cycle includes the stages of deformation development and preservation and the subsequent recovery of the initial shape. According to the obtained results, maximum deflection corresponds to the first loading step at the rubbery material state, because the elastic modulus is very low. During cooling under a constant load the deformation remains constant. After unloading in glassy state the deflection decreases by a small value, because the glassy elastic modulus significantly exceeds the rubbery one. During subsequent heating the rod recovers its initial undeformed shape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Nickel-based superalloys are usually exposed to high static or cyclic loads in non-ambient environment, so a reliable prediction of their mechanical properties, especially plastic deformation, at elevated temperature is essential for improved damage-tolerance assessment of components. Methods In this paper, plastic deformation in a single-crystal nickel-based superalloy CMSX4 at elevated temperature was modelled using discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD). The DDD approach was implemented using a representative volume element with explicitly-introduced precipitate and periodic boundary condition. The DDD model was calibrated using stress–strain response predicted by a crystal plasticity model, validated against tensile and cyclic tests at 850 °C for &lt;001 &gt; and &lt;111 &gt; crystallographic orientations, at a strain rate of 1/s. Results The DDD model was capable to capture the global stress–strain response of the material under both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. Considerably higher dislocation density was obtained for the &lt;111 &gt; orientation, indicating more plastic deformation and much lower flow stress in the material, when compared to that for &lt;001 &gt; orientation. Dislocation lines looped around the precipitate, and most dislocations were deposited on the surface of precipitate, forming a network of dislocation lines. Simple unloading resulted in a reduction of dislocation density. Conclusions Plastic deformation in metallic materials is closely related to dynamics of dislocations, and the DDD approach can provide a more fundamental understanding of crystal plasticity and the evolution of heterogeneous dislocation networks, which is useful when considering such issues as the onset of damage in the material during plastic deformation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Incorporation of active fillers to rubber markedly improves the strength properties and deformation characteristics of such materials. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is suggested in this work. It is based on the fact that for large deformations the binder (high-elastic, cross-linked elastomer) in the gaps between the filler particles (carbon black) is in a state close to the uniaxial extension. The greater part of polymer molecular chains are oriented along the loading axis in this situation. Therefore it can be assumed that the material in this state has a higher strength compared to other ones at the same intensity of deformation. In this paper, a new strength criterion is proposed, and a few examples are given to illustrate its possible use. It is shown that microscopic ruptures that occur during materials deformation happen not in the space between filler particles but at some distance around from it without breaking particle “interactions” through these gaps. The verification of this approach in modeling the stretching of a sample from an unfilled elastomer showed that in this case it works in full accordance with the classical strength criteria, where the presence in the material of a small defect (microscopic incision) leads to the appearance and catastrophic growth of the macrocrack.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background An electronic device consists of electronic components attached on a circuit board. Reliability of such a device is limited to fatigue properties of the components as well as of the board. Printed circuit board (PCB) consists of conducting traces and vertical interconnect access (via) out of copper embedded in a composite material. Usually the composite material is fiber reinforced laminate out of glass fibers and polyimid matrix. Different reasons play a role by choosing the components of the laminate for the board, one of them is its structural strength and fatigue properties. An improvement of board’s lifetime can be proposed by using computational mechanics. Methods In this work we present the theory and computation of a simplified one layer circuit board conducting electrical signals along its copper via, producing heat that leads to thermal stresses. Results Such stresses are high enough to perform a plastic deformation. Although the plastic deformation is small, subsequent use of the electronic device causes accumulating plastic deformation, which ends the lifetime effected by a fatigue failure in the copper via. Conclusion Computer simulations provide a convenient method for understanding the nature of this phenomenon as well as predicting the lifetime. We present a coupled and monolithic way for solving the multiphysics problem of this electro-thermo-mechanical system, numerically, by using finite element method in space and finite difference method in time.",

Over the last few years, the authors have focused on the development of an understanding of such behaviour in heterogeneous functional materials for energy conversion and storage, called HeteroFoaM ( www.HeteroFoaM.com ). Using paradigm problems, this work will indicate major directions for developing generally applicable methods for the multiphysics, multi-scale design of heterogeneous functional materials. Methods The present paper outlines the foundation for developing validated predictive computational methods that can be used in the design of multi-phase heterogeneous functional materials, or HeteroFoaM, as a genre of materials. Such methods will be capable of designing not only the constituent materials and their interactions, but also the morphology of the shape, size, surfaces and interfaces that define the heterogeneity and the resulting functional response of the material system. Results Relationships to applications which drive this development are identified. A paradigm problem based on dielectric response is formulated and discussed in context.

Methods To achieve the objective through experimental investigation is carried out and the influence of input process parameters (powder concentration, duty ratio, pulse on time, table speed and wheel speed) on surface roughness (SR), MRR and surface integrity has been studied. The fine grade silicon carbide powder of #1000 mesh sizes was mixed in dielectric medium with varying concentration to understand the influence of the powder concentration and its interaction with other process parameters during powder mixed electric discharge grinding (PMEDG). The central composite rotatable design (CCRD) has been used to plan the experiments. Optimization of the obtained statistical models of MRR and SR has been done to obtain highest MRR and lowest SR. Result It was observed that the MRR achieved by PMEDG was 3 – 10 times higher than EDG. It was found that all the process factors and interactions show significant contribution on SR. The SR obtained by PMEDG was 2 – 4 times higher than EDG.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Fiber–reinforced polymer composite materials are widely used in different branches of industry due to their distinctive features such as high specific strength and stiffness and due to as considerable opportunity to formulate materials with controllable variation of properties in response to the action of external factors (smart-materials). A distinguishing feature of products made of composite materials is that the processes of product and material fabrication are inseparable. Therefore the estimation of composite properties based on the composite architecture and properties of the reinforcing fibers and matrix is a very actual task. Methods The model of polymer behavior at glass transition recently developed by the authors was generalized to the case of fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites using two approaches: one is base on the concept of free specific energy, the other – on the growth of matrix stiffness. For homogeneous materials these two approaches are of equal worth, whereas for composite materials they give different results under deformation in the transverse direction. The stiffness growth approach is more accurate, but is very expensive computationally and, is highly sensitive to the experimental data errors. Results Using the finite element method and averaging technique the thermoelastic constants of composites containing different types of fibers in the glassy and high-elastic states were calculated based on the fiber and matrix properties. Softening of the matrix has an insignificant effect on the longitudinal modulus of a composite but leads to a considerable decrease of the transverse and shear moduli. The coefficient of thermal expansion in the transverse direction is much higher than the coefficient of thermal expansion in the longitudinal direction, especially when the composite is in the high-elastic state. Conclusion The model of polymer behavior at glass transition recently developed by the authors can be generalized to the case of fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites. The thermoelastic constants of composites containing different types of fibers can be calculated from the fiber and matrix properties using the finite element method and averaging technique.",
