    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to present the light emitting diode (LED) technology for greenhouse plant lighting and to give an overview about LED light effects on photosynthetic indices, growth, yield and nutritional value in green vegetables and tomato, cucumber, sweet pepper transplants. The sole LED lighting, applied in closed growth chambers, as well as combinations of LED wavelengths with conventional light sources, fluorescent and high pressure sodium lamp light, and natural illumination in greenhouses are overviewed. Red and blue light are basal in the lighting spectra for green vegetables and tomato, cucumber, and pepper transplants; far red light, important for photomorphogenetic processes in plants also results in growth promotion. However, theoretically unprofitable spectral parts as green or yellow also have significant physiological effects on investigated plants. Presented results disclose the variability of light spectral effects on different plant species and different physiological indices.",

    "abstract": "The interest in the use of monoterpenes for insect pest and pathogen control originates from the need for pesticide products with less negative environmental and health impacts than highly effective synthetic pesticides. The expanding literature on the possibility of the use of these monoterpenes is reviewed and focused on the effects of limonene on various bioorganisms. Limonene is used as insecticide to control ectoparasites of pet animals, but it has activity against many insects, mites, and microorganisms. Possible attractive effects of limonene to natural enemies of pests may offer novel applications to use natural compounds for manipulation of beneficial animals in organic agriculture. However, in few cases limonene-treated plants have become attractive to plant damaging insects and phytotoxic effects on cultivated plants have been observed. As a plant-based natural product limonene and other monoterpenes might have use in pest and weed control in organic agriculture after phytotoxicity on crop plants and, effects on non-target soil animals and natural enemies of pest have been investigated",

    "abstract": "The present re-evaluation of a dataset of systematically collected laboratory analyses and in vivo digestibility information for several types of silages gives convincing evidence of the biological weaknesses of feed characterisation based on the proximate feed analysis. The problems include intrinsic failures of the analysis in describing cause-response relationships between forage composition and digestibility, and heavy dependency of the equations on forage specific and environmental factors. It is concluded that proximate analysis is not suitable for characterisation of neither forages nor concentrate feedstuffs. In vitro pepsin-cellulase solubility of organic matter (OMS) and concentration of indigestible neutral detergent fibre (iNDF) predicted forage organic matter digestibility (OMD) with an acceptable accuracy for practical feed evaluation purposes provided that forage type dependent correction equations were employed. The revised detergent system dividing forage dry matter (DM) into almost completely available neutral detergent solubles (NDS), and insoluble residue (neutral detergent fibre, NDF) shows potential for future development. The combined use of long-term in situ ruminal incubation and NDF fractionation can be used to divide forage DM into three biologically meaningful fractions: NDS, iNDF and potentially digestible NDF (pdNDF). The summative models can then be used to predict forage D-value, i.e. apparently digestible organic matter in forage (g kg-1 DM). The models sum digestible NDS, which can be determined by Lucas equation, and digestible NDF (dNDF), which is the amount of pdNDF that is actually digested during any specific fermentation or retention time. Forage type specific summative models were as good as regression equations based on OMS or iNDF in predicting forage D-value and general summative models gave better results than general equations based on iNDF and especially OMS. If the goal is to reduce prediction error of D-value below 15 g kg-1 DM, forage type specific prediction equations should be used regardless of whether they are based on OMS, iNDF or summative models. Another option in the future may be dynamic models, which can incorporate simultaneously the two important dynamic processes constraining feed digestion in ruminants: the rates of NDF passage and degradation (kd). However, a vital prerequisite to employ dynamic models in practical feed evaluation is that iNDF and kd can be easily and reliably determined from on-farm forages. Although a NIRS prediction equation for iNDF will be adopted in practical use in the near future in Finland, the methodology for estimating kd warrants further research.;",

Most new techniques in silage microbiology use the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to make copies of a portion of the DNA in microorganisms. These techniques allow us to identify and quantify species as well as do community analysis. The PCR-based techniques are uncovering new species, both bacteria and fungi, during storage and feeding. Silage inoculants are widely available, but of greater interest has been research investigating why inoculants are so successful. Various inoculant strains have been found to produce bacteriocins and other compounds that inhibit other bacteria and fungi, improving their chances for success. In vitro ruminal fermentation research is showing that some inoculated silages affect rumen microorganisms, reducing methane in some cases and increasing microbial biomass production in others. Better understanding of silage microbiology will allow us to better manage silos and develop better inoculants to improve silage quality.",

    "abstract": "Climate change offers new opportunities for Finnish field crop production, which is currently limited by the short growing season. A warmer climate will extend the thermal growing season and the physiologically effective part of it. Winters will also become milder, enabling introduction of winter-sown crops to a greater extent than is possible today. With this study we aim to characterise the likely regional differences in capacity to grow different seed producing crops. Prolongation of the Finnish growing season was estimated using a 0.5º latitude × 0.5º longitude gridded dataset from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The dataset comprised an average estimate from 19 global climate models of the response of Finnish climate to low (B1) and high (A2) scenarios of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions for 30-year periods centred on 2025, 2055 and 2085 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Growing season temperature sums that suit crop growth and are agronomically feasible in Finland are anticipated to increase by some 140 °Cd by 2025, 300 °Cd by 2055 and 470 °Cd by 2085 in scenario A2, when averaged over regions, and earlier sowing is expected to take place, but not later harvests. Accordingly, the extent of cultivable areas for the commonly grown major and minor crops will increase considerably. Due to the higher base temperature requirement for maize (Zea mays L.) growth than for temperate crops, we estimate that silage maize could become a Finnish field crop for the most favourable growing regions only at the end of this century. Winters are getting milder, but it will take almost the whole century until winters such as those that are typical for southern Sweden and Denmark are experienced on a wide scale in Finland. It is possible that introduction of winter-sown crops (cereals and rapeseed) will represent major risks due to fluctuating winter conditions, and this could delay their adaptation for many decades. Such risks need to be studied in more detail to estimate timing of introduction. Prolonged physiologically effective growing seasons would increase yielding capacities of major field crops. Of the current minor crops, oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) are particularly strong candidates to become major crops. Moreover, they have good potential for industrial processing and are currently being bred. Realisation of increased yield potential requires adaptation to 1) elevated daily mean temperatures that interfere with development rate of seed crops under long days, 2) relative reductions in water availability at critical phases of yield determination, 3) greater pest and disease pressure, 4) other uncertainties caused by weather extremes and 5) generally greater need for inputs such as nitrogen fertilisers for non-nitrogen fixing crops.;",

A distinction is made between field-derived mycotoxins, i.e. mycotoxins that are formed during growth of crops in the field, and ensilage-derived mycotoxins, i.e. mycotoxins that are formed after ensiling. The routes of transmission of these hazards from feed to milk, the effect of pasteurization of milk, and reduction strategies are discussed. Aerobic deterioration of silages is a major factor influencing levels of spores of both aerobic and anaerobic spore-formers, L. monocytogenes, and certain mycotoxins.",

The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of BC on soil characteristics, nutrient uptake and crop yield in field experiments on two temperate soils (Cambisol and Chernozem) in Austria. Maize and wheat (Cambisol), and barley and sunflower (Chernozem) were grown in successive vegetation periods following different BC application rates (0, 24 and 72 t ha-1 at the start of the experiment), supplemented with identical mineral N supply in 33 m² plots. BC treatments showed varying impacts on nutrient uptake of the investigated crops. The first growing season in the Chernozem region was affected by a prolonged drought period, which resulted in positive effects of BC on soil water-holding capacity (WHC) and barley crop yield (+ 10%) for the 72 t ha-1 BC + N treatment compared to a control with identical nutrient supply but without BC. However, maize and wheat grain yield decreased by 46 and 70%, respectively, after the highest BC application rate (72 t ha-1) in an additional treatment without supplementary N-fertilisation. Still, even with high BC application rates we did not observe any adverse effects on crop yield and nutrient uptake, as long as the soil was supplied with sufficient N according to local agricultural practice.",

Also some oat malt has been produced as raw-material of ale and stout production. The main goals of malting have been the degradation of grain storage components to soften the kernel structure, synthesis of amylolytic enzymes and production of nutrients for brewing yeast. Also flavour and colour attributes have been important. During the recent years interest has arisen also in the secondary metabolites produced during germination, which can have valuable health promoting properties and act as bioactive or functional compounds in foods. By using a tailored germination/malting process a desired combination of valuable properties may be obtained in germinating grains or seeds. All this requires knowledge and know-how of the germination process and the biochemistry behind it. This paper reviews the scientific knowledge about germination/malting of oat with special emphasis on changes in grain characteristics.;",

Statistical comparisons were made between three adjacent 35-year periods. The results indicate that the growing season lengthened considerably at all sites between 1891-1925 and 1926-1960. Lengthening has continued at a slower rate up to the present at the eight Fennoscandian sites but not at the Icelandic site. In contrast, the intensity of the growing season, expressed by effective temperature sum above 5°C, which increased at all sites between the first two periods, has decreased slightly at all locations except Turku in recent decades. Under three scenarios, representing the range of estimated greenhouse gas-induced warming by the 2050s, the growing season is expected to lengthen at all sites. For a “Central” scenario, the greatest lengthening is computed for southern and western Scandinavia (7-8 weeks) with smaller changes in Finland (4 weeks) and Iceland (3 weeks). With a lengthening growing season during the past century in Fennoscandia, there are likely to have been impacts on natural and managed ecosystems. Some evidence of recent biotic and abiotic effects already exists, but other indicators of long-term change remain to be analysed.",

    "abstract": "In this review the quality properties of linseed oil for food uses are discussed as well as factors affecting this quality. Linseed oil has a favourable fatty acid composition with a high linolenic acid content. Linseed oil contains nearly 60% á-linolenic acid, compared with 25% for plant oils generally. The content of linolenic acid and omega-3 fatty acids is reported to be high in linseed grown in northern latitudes. The composition of fatty acids, especially unsaturated fatty acids, reported in different studies varies considerably for linseed oil. This variation depends mainly on differences in the examined varieties and industrial processing treatments. The fatty acid composition leads also to some problems, rancidity probably being the most challenging. Some information has been published concerning oxidation and taste, whereas only a few studies have focused on colour or microbiological quality. Rancidity negatively affects the taste and odour of the oil. There are available a few studies on effects of storage on composition of linseed oil. In general, storage and heat promote auto-oxidation of fats, as well as decrease the amounts of tocopherols and vitamin E in linseed oil. Several methods are available to promote the quality of the oil, including agronomic methods and methods of breeding as well as chemical, biotechnological and microbiological methods. Time of harvesting and weather conditions affect the quality and yield of the oil.;",

A colorimetric method based on the extraction of air dry and ground peat samples with 0.025 M sodium pyrophosphate solution was compared with the direct examination of fresh samples by the method of von Post. A significant but not very high correlation was found between the data given by these two methods. It was supposed that colorimetric prodecures of this kind can only be used as supplements of other methods. A rather close correlation was found between the volume weights of air-dry and ground samples and the corresponding values determined by the method of von Post. Because of this result and in view of the fact that the volume weight is a quantity generally determined always when peat analyses are performed, it would offer a convenient basis for the estimation of the degree of humification. Since the material studied contained only some very well humified samples the applicability of the volume weight to the determination of the degree of decomposition of this kind of samples was not proved. A simple scale of humification based on the volume weight was adopted. Its basic unit was 0.08 or the volume weight obtained for the undecomposed plant material collected from various kinds of peat land. It depends, of course, on the method employed for the determination of the volume weight. The elimination of the effect of the ash content of these virgin peat samples did not significantly improve the correlation of the H-values and the volume weights. The material of this investigation consisted of 220 samples collected from various depths of virgin peat soils.",

    "abstract": "This study was begun in 1990 when there was a marked shortage of short fibre raw material for the pulp industry. During the last ten years the situation has changed little, and the shortage is still apparent. It was estimated that 0.5 to 1 million hectares of arable land would be set aside from cultivation in Finland during this period. An alternative to using hardwoods in printing papers is non-wood fibres from herbaceous field crops. The study aimed at determining the feasibility of using non-wood plants as raw material for the pulp and paper industry, and developing crop management methods for the selected species. The properties considered important for a fibre crop were high yielding ability, high pulping quality and good adaptation to the prevailing climatic conditions and possibilities for low cost production. A strategy and a process to identify, select and introduce a crop for domestic short fibre production is described in this thesis. The experimental part of the study consisted of screening plant species by analysing fibre and mineral content, evaluating crop management methods and varieties, resulting in description of an appropriate cropping system for large-scale fibre plant production. Of the 17 herbaceous plant species studied, monocotyledons were most suitable for pulping. They were productive and well adapted to Finnish climatic conditions. Of the monocots, reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) were the most promising. These were chosen for further studies and were included in field experiments to determine the most suitable harvesting system and fertilizer application procedures for biomass production. Reed canary grass was favoured by delayed harvesting in spring when the moisture content of the crop stand was 10-15% of DM before production of new tillers. When sown in early spring, reed canary grass typically yielded 7-8 t ha-1 within three years on clay soil. The yield exceeded 10 t ha-1 on organic soil after the second harvest year. Spring harvesting was not suitable for tall fescue and resulted in only 37-54% of dry matter yields and in far fewer stems and panicles than harvested during the growing season. The economic optimum for fertilizer application rate for reed canary grass ranged from 50 to 100 kg N ha-1 when grown on clay soil and harvested in spring. On organic soil the fertilizer rates needed were lower. If tall fescue is used for raw material for paper, fertilizer application rates higher than 100 kg N ha-1 were not of any additional benefit. It was possible to decrease the mineral content of raw material by harvesting in spring, using moderate fertilizer application rates, removing leaf blades from the raw material and growing the crop on organic soil. The fibre content of the raw material increased the later the crop was harvested, being highest in spring. Removing leaf blades and using minimum fertilizer application rates in-creased the fibre content of biomass.;",

    "abstract": "Oats contain 3-5% of mixed linked beta-glucan, or (1-3), (1-4) â-D-glucan, referred to hereafter as beta-glucan. Oat beta-glucan is a viscous, and soluble dietary fibre component. Soluble and viscous dietary fibres, including the beta-glucan present in oats are associated with two major health promoting effects, i.e. the attenuation of postprandial plasma glucose and insulin levels and the control of cholesterol. Increased viscosity in the intestine delays absorption of glucose and suppresses absorption of cholesterol and reabsorption of bile acids. In spite of its apparent key role physiologically the viscosity of beta-glucan has been discussed relatively little in terms of analytical procedures. In clinical studies performed with oats, the viscosity of beta-glucan has been properly documented in only a few cases. Viscosity of beta-glucan in foods and in the food digest depends on solubility, concentration and molecular weight. A food manufacturer aiming at health-promoting products must pay attention not only to sufficient concentration of beta-glucan (dose) in the raw material, but also to the processing methods that will ensure sufficient solubility of beta-glucan and minimize enzymatic or mechanical breakdown of the beta-glucan molecule. We have been working both with different food processes utilising oat fractions high in beta-glucan and with the development of a method for viscosity determination of the soluble beta-glucan fibre. This review discusses some of the aspects related to the development with a method that could predict the behaviour of beta-glucan in oat processing with respect to its anticipated physiological functions.;",

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to review research which has evaluated the feeding of dairy cows with diets containing large proportions of grass silage. In Finland, milk production systems evolved are based on the use of restrictively fermented silages. Higher potential yields, smaller production risks than with cereal grains, short grazing period and high digestibility of grasses grown in northern latitudes have facilitated this development. Factors affecting nutrient supply from these diets are discussed. Digestibility is determined mainly by the stage of maturity at harvesting and it is not markedly affected by the level of energy and protein supplementation. Intake of grass silage is influenced both by digestibility and fermentation characteristics. Efficiency of microbial synthesis is high in animals given diets based on restrictively fermented silage but rumen fermentation pattern is characterised by low molar proportions of propionate. Production responses to additional concentrate are relatively small, especially when the amount of concentrate exceeds 10 kg day-1. High substitution of silage dry matter (DM), negative associative effects on digestion and partitioning of energy towards body tissues account for small production responses. Protein supplementation has consistently increased milk protein yield but responses do not appear to be related to the level of milk production, silage crude protein content, amount of concentrate or stage of lactation. The new protein evaluation system provides an accurate prediction of protein yield with the typical Finnish dairy cow diets. The high slopes (ca. 0.5) between protein supply and milk protein yield within experiments suggest that protein supply is suboptimal and protein supplements are used with a high efficiency.",

    "abstract": "A longer growing season and higher accumulated effective temperature sum (ETS) will improve crop production potential in Finland. The production potential of new or at present underutilised crops (e.g. maize (Zea mays L.), oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), lucerne (Medicago sativa L.)) will improve and it will be possible to grow more productive varieties of the currently grown crops (spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oats (Avena sativa L.)). Also cultivation of autumn sown crops could increase if winters become milder and shorter, promoting overwintering success. Climatic conditions may on the other hand become restrictive in many ways. For example, early season droughts could intensify because of higher temperatures and consequent higher evaporation rates. Current low winter temperatures and short growing season help restrict the development and spread of pests and pathogens, but this could change in the future. Longer growing seasons, warmer autumns and milder winters may initiate new problems with higher occurrences of weeds, pests and pathogens, including new types of viruses and virus vectors. Anoxia of overwintering crops caused by ice encasement, and physical damage caused by freezing and melting of water over the fields may also increase. In this study we identify the most likely changes in crop species and varieties in Finland and the pest and pathogen species that are most likely to create production problems as a result of climate change during this century.;",

    "abstract": "Conservation tillage practices were tested against autumn mouldboard ploughing for differences in physical properties of soil, surface runoff, subsurface drainflow and soil erosion. The study (1991 -2001) was performed on a gently (2%) sloping clayey soil of southern Finland, with two replicates of the tillage treatments on 0.5 ha plots. The annual shares of surface runoff of the total flow (surface runoff + subsurface drainflow) were 842% for ploughing (depth 2023 cm), 3666% for shallow autumn stubble cultivation (depth 58 cm) and 3682% for soil left untilled over winter. Surface runoff increased with decrease in the tillage intensity, and in line with the values of depressional water storage, macroporosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Erodibility of this gently sloping soil was at highest after autumn and spring tillage operations and decreased with time. Shallow autumn tillage produced erosion as high as mouldboard ploughing (4071700 kg ha1yr1), but 48% and 12% lower erosion levels were measured from plots left untilled in autumn, covered by grass or barley residues, respectively. Eroded soil particles moved relatively freely to the subsurface drains, which carried 3794% of the annual soil losses from the field. The study shows that even on the relatively flat clayey soils typical for southern Finland, tillage has a great influence on soil losses. The frequency of tillage needs to be reduced rather than the depth of tillage on clayey soils with poor water conductivity and structural stability if soil loss is to be diminished by conservation tillage.;",

A greenhouse experiment and two field experiments were conducted. The biochar application did not significantly increase or decrease the microbial biomass. Only the addition of vineyard pruning biochar pyrolysed at 400°C caused microbial biomass to increase in the greenhouse experiment. The biochar treatments however caused shifts in microbial communities (visualized by principal component analysis). We concluded that the shifts in the microbial community structure are an indirect rather than a direct effect and depend on soil conditions and nutrient status.",

    "abstract": "Because of the climatic conditions, the Finnish milk production research has focused to improve the utilisation of grassland, mainly as conserved forages. The main research areas have been ensiling, evaluation of the forage feeding value, predicting nutrient supply from grass silage-based diet and the effects of forage quality and concentrate supplementation on milk production responses. Due to changes in ensiling technologies and variety of forage crops new silage additives have been adopted. A centralized system for the analysis of forage energy value is based on NIRS calibration. It was calibrated against in vitro pepsin-cellulase solubility method that was validated against in vivo digestibility. The concentration of indigestible neutral detergent fibre was found to be a useful parameter both in empirical models predicting forage digestibility and mechanistic rumen models predicting the amounts of absorbed nutrients. Models predicting relative intake potential of forages and total diet were developed, and an intake model combining animal and diet effects independently of each other was developed. Using meta-analysis approaches a nutrient response model was developed for dairy cows for milk, energy corrected milk and protein yield. Feed evaluation, intake and nutrient response models form now the basis of practical Finnish ration formulation system that can optimize diets according to maximum income over feed cost in addition to minimum feed cost.",

In this paper we discuss P retention and release mechanisms, and review studies on the Pretention of different materials and their use as reactive media in filter beds. The main mechanisms for P retentionare sorption on metal (mostly Fe or Al) hydroxide surfaces and, in alkaline conditions, the formation of Ca-Pprecipitates. The retention of P is strongly affected by the chemical composition of a material, its particle size andpH-related effects on sorption and precipitation both during testing and in practical operation. Laboratory testsare sensitive to solution chemistry (pH, alkalinity, ionic strength and composition, P concentration) and affected bymaterial-to-solution ratio, contact time and agitation. Moreover, due to deviations from realistic field conditions,laboratory tests may produce imprecise estimates of the retention capacity and retention kinetics. In particular,materials that contain soluble substances (e.g., CaO) that elevate the pH of the ambient solution to high levels mayin batch tests suggest a high capacity for P retention, but will most probably show much lower retention in fieldsettings. On the other hand, materials containing metal oxides also retain P via slow reactions, and their retentioncapacity may be underestimated in short equilibrations. Appropriate laboratory test procedures will dependon their intended applications and material properties. Long-term field-scale tests are few in number, but some ofthem have shown promising results. Field-scale tests have, however, highlighted the design of the filters as a criticalfactor in their efficiency. ﻿",

    "abstract": "The high rates of rumen fermentation, physical breakdown and passage rates from the rumen of legume silages lead to higher intakes than for grass silages of comparable digestibility. Although total tract digestibilities for legume silages and maize silages are often lower than for grass silages, milk yields are usually higher. A further benefit of legumes and maize is the reduced rate of decline in digestibility. Legume silages often lead to a reduction in milk fat concentration and increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 18:2 n-6 and 18:3 n-3. This latter effect is related to reduced rumen biohydrogenation as a consequence of increased rumen passage rates or the effects of polyphenol oxidase. There is quite a wide range of maturities (300 – 350 g kg-1 DM) that leads to maximum dry matter intakes and milk production from maize silage; milk production is reduced with immature or over–mature maize crops. Forage chop length exerts a number of effects, both in the silo and in the rumen, but effects on rumen function, feed intake and milk production have been inconsistent. The high protein content and high N degradability of most legume silages is associated with a low efficiency of converting dietary N into milk N, with a concomitant increase in urine N. Reducing N intake by inclusion of maize silage in mixtures with legume silages leads to a marked reduction in urine N without loss of production potential. It is predicted, on the basis of their chemical composition and rumen kinetics, that legume silages and maize silages would reduce methane production relative to grass silage, though in vivo measurements are lacking. Extensive fermentation in the silo reduces the amount of fermentable substrate, and reduced methane production in comparison with grass silage where fermentation had been restricted by high levels of acid additive.",

Lipid peroxidation and the changes of antioxidative enzymes were measured at two growing stages. The positive synergistic effect of the lower Se dosage and UV was found to be at least partly associated with the antioxidative role of Se through increased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activity, whereas ascorbate peroxidase (APX) responded negatively to both factors. The contribution of the other enzymes studied seemed to be plant-specific: glutathione S-transferase (GST) increased in both ryegrass assays and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the first lettuce assay. At the higher addition level Se acted as a pro-oxidant and diminished fresh weight yields. UV irradiation alleviated the toxicity coincidently with increase of CAT in ryegrass and SOD in lettuce.;",

In the first year (establishment of the ley, 1992-93), N losses (drainage + surface runoff) were slightly higher after application of slurry in autumn (with immediate ploughing, treatment 2) than in treatments 1, 4 and 5 (21 kg ha-1 vs. 17 kg ha-1), but the respective P losses (0.7-0.9 kg ha-1) were not affected. During the ley years (1993-96) the N and P losses were increased by surface application of fertilizers and by abundance of surface runoff (83-100% of the total runoff). Nutrient losses were extremely high after slurry application in autumn and winter, accounting for 11% and 33% of the applied N and 17% and 59% of the applied P, respectively. The N losses during the ley years from treatments 1-5 were 13, 62, 191, 23 and 24 kg ha-1, where the proportion of NH4-N was 21, 49, 56, 33 and 39%.

The effect of Norwegian MBM as N fertilizer has been evaluated in pot and field experiments. The soils used in the pot experiment were peat and a sand/peat mixture, both low in content of plant nutrients. The field experiment was carried out on a silt loam. In the pot experiment increasing amounts of MBM gave significantly increased yields, although there was a partly N immobilisation shortly after seeding the soil based on peat organic matter. In the field experiment there was no period of N immobilisation and good N effect was found also for small amounts of MBM (Total N 50 kg ha-1). At total N 100 kg ha-1 there were no significant differences in grain yield of spring wheat between the treatments with MBM, mineral N fertilizer, and combination of MBM and mineral N fertilizer (N 50 kg ha-1 from each). The results indicate that the relative N efficiency of MBM compared to mineral fertilizer is 80% or higher, if MBM is applied to cereals in spring.;",

    "abstract": "Legumes are important in world agriculture, providing biologically fixed nitrogen, breaking cereal disease cycles and contributing locally grown food and feed, including forage. Pea and faba bean were grown by early farmers in Finland, with remains dated to 500 BC. Landraces of pea and faba bean were gradually replaced by better adapted, higher quality materials for food use. While grain legumes have been restricted by their long growing seasons to the south of the country, red, white and alsike clovers are native throughout and have long been used in leys for grazing, hay and silage. Breeding programmes released many cultivars of these crops during the 1900s, particularly pea and red clover. A.I. Virtanen earned the 1945 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on both nitrogen fixation and silage preservation. Use of crop mixtures may appear modern, but farmers used them already in the early 1800s, when oat was used to support pea, and much effort has been devoted to improving the system and establishing its other benefits. Although international cultivars have been easily accessible since Finlands 1995 entry into the European Union, the combination of feed quality and appropriate earliness is still needed, as &lt; 1% of arable land is sown to grain legumes and an increase to 910% would allow replacement of imported protein feeds. Climate change will alter the stresses on legume crops, and investment in agronomy, physiology and breeding is needed so that farmers can gain from the many advantages of a legume-supported rotation.;",

The start of the thermal growing season was used to represent all climatic factors affecting sowing time. Regional anomalies in sowing and start of growing season were computed for the years 19652007. The start of the growing season was 22.8 days earlier per decade, with a steeper increase since 1980. Sugar beet sowing advanced 2.5 (since 1980 5.2) and potato planting 3.4 (since 1980 4.5) days per decade, more than expected solely due to earlier starts to the growing season. Sowing of spring cereals advanced 0.6, 0.7 and 1.7 days per decade in the east, north and west respectively (since 1980 1.0, 1.9 and 3.1), with statistically significant trend (p &lt; 0.01) in the west. Earlier sowings can be largely explained by warmer springs, but the trend was not as steep as that for the growing season. This has however not led to increased temperatures during early vegetative phases and thus faster development and increased drought or pest risk, which would have reduced the positive effects of earlier sowing on yield potential. Earlier sowing detected in the west can be explained by changes in spring temperatures, but may also result from economic and technological development. Farmers seem to have adequately adjusted their field activities to the changes in spring temperatures.;",

Dry weight, soluble solids, titratable acidity, total sugar, reducing sugar, sucrose, vitamin C, total polyphenol (gallic acid equivalents); 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity; and phenolics profile were measured from the fruits harvested from different treatments.

The annual energy potential of raw biomass obtained from crop residues and bioenergy crops cultivated in fields set aside from food production is at present 122133 EJ, 8693 EJ or 4750 EJ, when a vegetarian, moderate or affluent diet is followed, respectively.

Of the potential field bioenergy production, 3942 EJ now and 3841 EJ in 2050 would derive from crop residues. The residue potential depends, however, on local climate, and may be considerably lower than the technically harvestable potential, when soil quality and sustainable development are considered. Arable land could be used for bioenergy crops, particularly in Australia, South and Central America and the USA. If crop production technology was improved in areas where environmental conditions allow more efficient food production, such as the former Soviet Union, large areas in Europe could also produce bioenergy in set aside fields.

In the method the sugars are extracted from the sample with 80 % ethanol, the starch is gelatinised by boiling with water for 10 minutes, after which it is hydrolysed into glucose by amyloglucosidase at pH 4.8 at 40°C (20—22 hours) or at 60°C (4—5 hours). The reducing sugars are determined. Purification of the solution for the sugar determination is not necessary for cereal products, peas and potatoes. For vegetables and legumes ionexchange purification reduces the results by 0—0.3 per cent units. The buffer concentration in the sugar determination should be less than 0.01 M. The method was found to give a 100 per cent result for pure starch preparations. The purity of the hydrolysates was examined by paper chromatography and it was observed that, at least for some materials poor in starch, the starch hydrolysate contains small amounts of other sugars besides glucose. However, with a short hydrolysing time these amount to only 0.2—0.3 % of the original dry matter. The repeatability of the method is good, 1—1 ½ %. The analysis of a series of 8—9 samples takes about 12 hours.",

The method of determining DM losses was the total-in versus total-out DM mass flow of the silos, including the determination of DM content and other silage parameters via manual sampling. The results taken from 48 silos showed on average for all investigated crops 9–12% of DM losses. Density and feed out rate showed a negative correlation to DM losses in maize silages. According to the applied method for determining DM losses on farm scale, a guideline of 8% can be suggested for maximum DM losses in bunker silos for grass and maize silages.

The potential of mycorrhizal symbioses to alleviate salt stress has been documented and benefits to plant revealed to be specific and dependent to both plant cultivars and fungal strains. A factorial greenhouse experiment was performed to determine the effects of three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species (Funneliformis caledonius, F. mosseae and Rhizophagus irregularis) on three ‘day-neutral’ strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) cultivars (‘Albion’, ‘Charlotte’ and ‘Seascape’), and a mixture of R. irregularis and F. mosseae on ‘Seascape’, under four salt conditions (0–200 mM NaCl). The overall results showed that plant biomass decreased with increasing salinity. The cultivars responded differently to both AMF and salinity, and ‘Seascape’ was more tolerant to salinity than the other cultivars. AMF enhanced plant growth and improved salt tolerance by increasing the proportion of medium (0.5&lt;ɸ≤1.5 mm) and coarse (ɸ&gt;1.5 mm) diameter roots. The mixture of two AMF species increased root and shoot mass to a higher degree than each species alone at low salinity (0–50 mM) but reduced fruit quality. At higher levels (100–200 mM), R. irregularis alleviated salt stress and improved fruit quality to a higher degree than the other AMF species. Our results support the use of bio-inoculants in saline horticultural areas. Because cultivars respond differently to fungal inoculants, and inoculants prefer specific environmental conditions, fungal inoculants need to be screened on a cultivar- and condition-specific basis.",

Favourable renneting properties were associated with κ-β-casein genotypes ABA1A2, ABA1A1 and AAA1A2 in the Finnish Ayrshire, and with ABA2B, AAA1A3, AAA2A3, ABA1A2 and ABA2A2 in the Finnish Friesian. The favourable effect of these genotypes on curd firming time and on firmness of the curd was partly due to their association with a high κ-casein concentration in the milk. The effect of the κ-casein E allele on renneting properties was unfavourable compared with that of the κ-casein B allele, and possibly with that of the A allele. The β-lactoglobulin genotypes had no effect on renneting properties but they had a clear effect on the protein composition of milk. The β-lactoglobulin AA genotype was associated with a high whey protein % and β-lactoglobulin concentration and the BB genotype with a high casein % and casein number.",

The results of biological control of damping-off did not vary in the peat lots of different origin whose natural disease suppressivity varied considerably. The control result was the same or better than chemical dressing with thiram. The acidity of the substrate (pH 4.8—8.6) had no effect on the effectiveness of biological control.

Point data on daily minimum temperatures from 14 weather stations and low and high warming scenarios were also used. From the 1970s to the present day, the areas of successful maturing of fruits have strongly expanded northwards. It is predicted that in 20112040, the warming of climate will allow expansion of commercial production in the south-eastern lake area, and a wider selection of cultivars for home gardens up to latitudes 6566°N. Risk of extremely low temperatures (Tm&lt; -26 °C) has reduced from 1980s to the present but may not reduce much more in 20112040. Risk to shoots from fluctuating temperatures in winter and spring is likely to increase under the high warming scenario, more in the south-west than in the south-east. Risk to trees from cold days (Tm&lt; -15 °C) with a concurrent thin snow cover is not predicted to increase. In the western inland of the country, below latitude 63°N, and in the south-western coast areas the frost risk during flowering may increase, especially in the early flowering cultivars. In order to adapt to and gain from the climatic change, breeding and testing targets should be modified within five years and they should include reduced sensitivity to temperature fluctuation in winter, late flowering, and frost tolerance of flowers.;",

    "abstract": "Soil test phosphorus (P) concentration has a major influence on the dissolved P concentration in runoff from agricultural soils. Thus, trends in soil test P partly determine the development of pollution potential of agricultural activities. We reviewed the changes of soil test P and P balances in Finnish agriculture, and assessed the current setting of P loss potential after two Agri-Environmental Programs. Phosphorus balance of the Finnish agriculture has decreased from +35 kg ha1 of the 1980s to about +8 kg P ha1 today. As a consequence, the 50-yr upward trend in soil test P concentrations has probably levelled out in the late 1990s, as suggested by sampling of about 1600 fields and by a modelling exercise. For the majority of our agricultural soils, soil test P concentrations are currently at a level at which annual P fertilization is unlikely to give measurable yield responses. Soils that benefit from annual P applications are more often found in farms specialized in cereal production, whereas farms specialized in non-cereal plant production and animal production have higher soil test P concentrations. An imbalance in P cycling between plant (feed) and animal production is obvious, and regional imbalances are a result of concentration of animal farms in some parts of the country. A major concern in future will be the fate of manure P in those regions where animal production intensity is further increasing.;",

The following factors were analyzed: total whey protein (WP), total immunoglobulins (Ig), lactoferrin (LF), lactoperoxidase (LP), lysozyme (LZM), and Salmonella typhimurium antibody titer towards somatic (04,12) and flagellar (H1.5, Hi) antigens. The content of all factors varied considerably in the first milking of the various cows, but the difference in content for all but LP and LZM decreased along with the number of milkings. The concentrations of WP, Ig and LF were at their highest in the first milking and dropped markedly in the following milkings. On the other hand, the LP concentration was on average greatest during the 3rd and 4th milkings, and the LZM concentration during the 7th and 8th milkings. The colostral whey from the first milking had the following concentrations on average: WP 69.2 mg/ml, Ig 52.0 mg/ml, LF 1.53 mg/ml, LP 22.8 µg/ml and LZM 0.40µ/ml. In the milk whey the concentrations were as follows: WP 12.2 mg/ml, Ig 0.95 mg/ml, LF 0.09 mg/ml, LP 20.1 µg/ml and LZM 0.37 µg/ml. Agglutinating antibodies to a human pathogenic strain of S. typhimurium were found against both O and H antigens in the colostrum of all cows. One cow, which had been vaccinated with S. typhimurium before parturition, had significantly higher titers than the unvaccinated animals. The latter were found to have antibodies only in the first two or three milkings post partum while the vaccinated cow still had antibodies in the milk 14 days post partum. The results obtained permit the assumption that in addition to antibodies, the nonspecific antibacterial factors (LF, LP and LZM) may contribute to the antimicrobial activity of colostrum and thus enhance the resistance of a newborn calf to microbial infections during the first week of life.",

On the average, water extracted less P from the heavy clay soils (4.8 ± 2.2mg/kg) than from the coarser clays (12.8 ± 4.6 mg/kg) and non-clay soils (13.3 + 7.2 mg/kg). Water extraction seemed to illustrate ’’the effective” P status, it is that determined by the quantity and quality of sorption components in soil, soil pH and the content of organic carbon. These factors did not affect the amounts of P dissolved in water directly but inderectly by controlling the nature of P bonding which, in turn, seems to be of decisive importance in the extractability of P into water. The P supplying power of a given fraction is obviously controlled by the quantity of corresponding sorption agent. Water extractable P correlated most closely with the molar ratio of NH4F soluble P to oxalate extractable Al (r=0.93***, n= 103). However, according to the theory presented, with progressing desorption, P starts to mobilize also from the NaOH soluble fraction, its significance being the more apparent the greater the corresponding molar ratio NaOH-P/Fe is. In addition, the role and significance of other inorganic P fractions were discussed.",

Furthermore, regression analysis is used to study the impact of farm characteristics on the observed specialization and diversification. The study is based a panel data set of about 900 farms participating in the Swedish Agricultural Economics Survey. Results show that farms are increasingly engaging in diversified activities, though in most firms these activities make only minor contributions to total revenue. Results also show that the degrees of specialization and diversification are influenced by characteristics of firms business structure, financial and demographic conditions. These results contribute to the understanding of farm business development, as well as show the need for policy makers and farm advisors to consider the differences between farms pursuing different development strategies in their efforts to influence behavior.;",

    "abstract": "The traditional production of mineral N and P fertilisers is unsustainable due its reliance on fossil fuels in the case of N, and on limited mineral resource stocks in the case of P. The use of alternative or complementary fertilisers that originate from organic waste materials is gaining interest. Organic farms, especially arable organic farms without livestock, need usable sources of plant nutrients. Meat bone meal (MBM), a potential organic fertiliser for agricultural crops, contains considerable amounts of nutrients (on average 8% N, 5% P, 1% K and 10% Ca). In EU countries, Commission regulation (EC) No 181/2006 authorised the use of MBM as an organic fertiliser. In this study, MBM was compared to conventional mineral NPK fertiliser. Two randomised complete block split-plot field experiments were conducted: one with spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) in two years; and another with oat (Avena sativa) for three years, including a fourth year of testing for residual effect. Compared to mineral fertiliser (20% N, 3% P and 9% K), MBM was applied at three N levels: 60, 90 and 120 kg N ha-1. The grain yield of both cereal species supported by MBM, did not differ from the yield obtained with the mineral fertiliser at any N level. At 120 kg N ha-1, the grain yield level with either type was ca. 4500 kg ha-1 of barley and 5000 kg ha-1 of oat, representing fair averages for Finnish conditions. Moreover, MBM and mineral fertilisation showed no differences in quality in terms of 1000-grain weight, test-weight, protein content and protein yield. Since MBM has a low N/P ratio, P was applied in surplus to attain comparable N levels. Therefore MBM fertilisation should be fitted for crop rotation and for meeting environmental requirements.;",

    "abstract": "The potential for and environmental consequences of localising primary production of food were investigated by considering different food consumption patterns, based on conventional and organic production. Environmental impact was assessed according to agricultural land use and numbers of production animals, both of which depend on food consumption. The results were quantified in terms of nutrient balances, greenhouse gas and acid emissions and the diversity of crop cultivation, which indicate eutrophication of watersheds, climate change and landscape changes, respectively. The study region was able to satisfy its own needs for all farming and food consumption scenarios. Dietary choice had a marked impact on agricultural land use and on the environmental parameters considered. Organic farming for local food production resulted in higher greenhouse gas emissions. Compared with mixed diets, the vegetarian diet was associated with lower emissions and nutrient surpluses, but also with reduced crop diversity. The arable areas allocated to leys and pastures were also smaller. The study area represents a predominantly rural region and is a net exporter of agricultural produce. Therefore, only part of the environmental impact of food production results from local needs. Both the differences among the dietary options and the overall environmental benefit of localised primary food production were greatly reduced when considering total agricultural production of the region. Much of the negative impact of agriculture is due to food consumption in the densely populated urban areas, but the consequences are mainly felt in the production areas. The environmental impacts of localisation of primary food production for the rural areas are small and inconsistent. The results indicate the importance of defining local on a regional basis and including the urban food sinks in impact assessment.;",

Energy ratios and net energy were determined on the basis of plant- and animal-specific energy analyses. In plant production, energy ratios and net energy were assessed as a function of nitrogen fertilization, because indirect energy input in the form of agrochemicals was 5473% from the total energy input and nitrogen was responsible for the major part of this. The highest energy ratio was 18.6 for reed canary grass. As a whole reed canary grass was superior to the other crops, which were barley, spring wheat, spring turnip rape, ley for silage, potato and sugar beet. Reed canary grass and sugar beet gained the highest net energy yields of 111115 GJ ha-1. The optimum energy ratio was gained in general with less nitrogen fertilization intensity than farmers use. The energy ratios in pork production varied between 0.141.28 depending on what was included or excluded in the analysis and for milk production between 0.151.85. Ratios of 1.28 in pork production and 1.85 in milk production are unrealistic as they do not give any shelter to the animals, although they can be approached in very low-input production systems. If the ratio is calculated with feed energy content then the ratio is low, 0.140.22 for pork and 0.15 for milk. This shows that animals can convert 1422 percent of the input energy to usable products. In pork production, the largest portion of the energy input was the ventilation of the building. In milk production milking and cooling consumes a lot of energy and for this reason the electricity consumption is high.;",

No such changes were found during the same periodin a nearby ‘reference’ catchment, where gypsum was not used. Gypsum did not affect soil test values for P, K, Mgor Ca, but it did increase the ionic strength and soil test SO4.

    "abstract": "The present study deals with the last continuous period of traditional farming in Finland, where old-type farming ended only in the 1870’s. Farm economy of the period in question was to a large degree based on self-sufficiency which involved many-sided and varied farm activities. At the same time crop husbandry was heavily predominant since the production of bread grain was of foremost importance. Characteristic of the crop husbandry was the use of varied and greatly differing farming methods. Technical development in this sector, as in all farm agriculture, was at the time minimal, and production could be increased only by extending the area under cultivation. The approximately six-fold population increase in Finland between the 1720’s and the 1870’s necessitated a rapid expansion in the area of cultivated land. In the 18th century the production of bread grain seems to have grown at about the same rate as the increase in population, but in the 19th century agricultural production began to lag behind to an increasing degree. The present study attempts to examine the factors that led to this development and to pay special attention to the structure of agricultural farming. Many different factors contributed to the slowing down grain production. The chief factor was the decline in the 19th century of the method of farming based on the bum-beating which had formed the basis of crop husbandry in eastern Finland in the previous century. As a joint result of various factors Finland became in the 19th century a country that had an underproduction of grain, the deficiency was covered by grain bought from Russia. The import of grain was made possible by the increased sales of livestock and forestry products. Independent fanners could cope with this changed state of affairs relatively well, but the landless population, in particular the casual farm workers, was faced with a difficult situation owing to the reduced possibilities of work. By the end of period the landless population already formed a large agricultural proletariat which developed into a heavy burden on the entire economic life of Finland for a long time to come and in fact right until the era of modern agriculture.",

The association of k with the sampling depth, the degree of decomposition, weight of volume, pH, extractable calcium, and the iron and aluminum dissolved by 0.1 N hydrochloric acid was treated. The acid-soluble aluminum gave with k a highly significant correlation which did not decrease when the effects of acid-soluble iron and the degree of humification were eliminated. The correlation between k and the acid-soluble iron was also highly significant although less close than the former association, and it was to some extent lowered by the elimination of the effect of aluminum. The fairly low, although statistically significant correlation between k and the degree of humification as expressed by the degree of decomposition or by the volume weight disappeared when the effect of aluminum was isolated. In the present material the sampling depth, pH and the content of extractable calcium did not give any significant correlation with k. As far as these results are valid under natural conditions, aluminum appears to play a more important role in the phosphorus sorption of peat soils than iron does.",

    "abstract": "There is great temporal and spatial variation in precipitation in Finland. Both drought episodes and repeated, abundant rains may interfere with crop growth, yield and quality formation, and many agricultural operations (such as tillage, sowing, crop protection and harvesting). The windows for optimal operations are often narrow due to the short growing season and variable weather conditions. Field traffic at high soil moisture may e.g. cause soil compaction. Also, the high environmental footprint on agriculture under high latitude conditions is often attributable to fluctuations in precipitation. The station-wise precipitation observations from the Finnish Meteorological Institute for the time period of 54 years (1961‒2014) were interpolated to a regular 10 km × 10 km grid covering the whole country. Several successive time slices were used to calculate the likelihood of: 1) drought periods and 2) periods with repeated rains with above normal precipitation sum so that both of these lasted for at least a) two weeks or b) three weeks. We demonstrated substantial spatial and temporal variation in the likelihood of drought and repeated rains: drought episodes were common during the early half of the growing season, while again repeated rains with high accumulated precipitation (lasting for two weeks) became common in the latter part of the growing season. Though, we highlighted in this paper some examples of how these events may affect agriculture and their environmental impacts, the datasets published here may be applied for many other assessments.",

These conventional methods degrade soil, increase greenhouse gas emissions, and pollute waterways through nutrient runoff. A circular economy enhances sustainability by minimizing waste, optimizing resource use, and recycling nutrients. This study analyzes the adoption of circular economy practices among farms in Southwest Finland and identifies influencing factors. A survey distributed to farmers measured the extent of circular practices and the challenges faced. Cross-tabulations and logistic regression analyses evaluated how farm characteristics and farmer attitudes impact implementation. Results show a slow and variable transition among farms. About 50% of respondents have reduced mineral fertilizer use, although trading in byproducts and especially on-farm energy production from byproducts remains uncommon. Many farmers highlight insufficient policy support. The study concludes that policy interventions, training, and education are essential to accelerate adoption and stresses the importance of tailored, regional decision-making for effective policy development.",

In this study, the impact of AS soils occurrence and hydrological changes on water quality were determined for 21 rivers (catchment sizes between 964122 km2) running through an AS soil hotspot area in western central Finland. Water samples, collected at the outlet, during eight selected events, were analysed for pH, dissolved organic carbon, electrical conductivity (EC) and 32 chemical elements. Based on the correlation with percentage arable land in the catchments (a rough estimate of AS soil occurrences, as up to 50% of the arable land is underlain with these soils), it was possible to categorize variables into those that are enriched in runoff from such land, depleted in runoff from such land (only one element), and not affected by land-use type in the catchments. Of the variables enriched in runoff from arable land, some were leached from AS soils during high-water flows, in particular (aluminium, boron, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese, nickel, sulphur, silicon, thorium, thallium, uranium, and zinc) and others occurred in highest concentrations during lower flows (calcium, EC, potassium, magnesium, sodium, rubidium and strontium). Molybdenum and phosphorus were not leached from AS soils in larger amounts than from other soils and thus related to other factors connected to the arable land. Based on the concentrations of potentially toxic metals derived from AS soils, the 21 rivers were ranked from the least (Lestijoki River, Lapväärtinjoki River and Perhonjoki River) to the most (Sulvanjoki River, Vöyrinjoki River and Maalahdenjoki River) heavily AS soil impacted. It has been decided that Vöyrinjoki is to be dredged along a ca. 20 km distance. This is quite alarming considering the high metal concentrations in the river.;",

Empirical models predicting the date of planting and emergence of potato were based on thermal time, and a model predicting the date of late blight outbreak was based on thermal time on rainy days. Experiments were conducted over 3 years under ambient and elevated (+3°C) temperatures to obtain parameter values for the growth model. Potato emergence is predicted to occur at 631 degree days accumulated above 0°C after the 16-day running mean temperature in spring exceeds 0°C. A blight outbreak is predicted to occur when the effective temperature sum accumulated above 8°C after potato emergence, on days with at least 0.1 mm of precipitation, achieves 156 degree days. In the prediction of the outbreak the maximum daily accumulation of temperature is limited to 10 degree days. A preliminary sensitivity study carried out at one site in southern Finland suggests that over a range of 1 to 3°C warming, the period during which late blight needs to be controlled by fungicide applications would be 10-20 days longer per 1°C of warming. The increase in yield loss of unprotected crops would be of the same magnitude as the increase in yield potential, around 2 t/ha of dry matter per 1°C of warming.",

The study consists of two experiments on goats dosed singly, either orally with grass sprayed with Na275SeO3 one week before cutting, intraruminally (I.R.) with Na275SeO3, or intravenously (I.V.) with Na275SeO3 or 75Se-selenomethionine. Follow-up periods were from 15 to 28 d long. Dietary Se levels were 0.05, 0.22 and 0.34 mg/kg DM. Values for 75Se absorption, excretion in milk, urine and faeces, 75Se activity in plasma, erythrocytes and hair are presented. In another experiment lasting 539 d, 48 dairy cows were fed either Na275SeO3 or grass silage sprayed with Na275SeO3 one week before cutting. Dietary Se levels were from 0.03 to 1.8 mg/kg DM. Se content in milk, plasma and erythrocytes, and GSH-Px activity in erythrocytes and plasma are given. True absorption of 75Se was 63 % and 65 %, and excretion of 75Se in milk 4 % and 7 % in the goats dosed I.R. with Na275SeO3 and orally with 75Se-labeled grass.

Addition of gluten and transglutaminase affected the structure of the protein network and distribution of water between the protein and starch phases. The differences in microstructure were quantified by determining the areas of starch and protein in the micrographs by image analysis. Breads baked with added gluten and water were softer and less gummy than the oat and wheat reference breads in the texture profile analysis. Addition of transglutaminase made the breads harder and gummier than the breads baked without the added enzyme. In the descriptive sensory analysis breads baked with added gluten or added gluten and water were evaluated as more soft and springy than the reference oat bread. Sensory characteristics of bread texture correlated well with the texture and microstructure measured instrumentally.;",

We examined whether these efforts have decreased agricultural nutrient losses and improved the quality of receiving waters. To do so we used monitoring data on fluxes of nutrients and total suspended solids in agricultural catchments in 19902004 and on the water quality of agriculturally loaded rivers, lakes and estuaries in 19902005. No clear reduction in loading or improvement in water quality was detected. Hydrological fluctuations do not seem to have eclipsed the effects of the measures taken, since there was no systematic pattern in runoff in the period studied. The apparent inefficiency of the measures taken may be due to the large nutrient reserves of the soil, which slowed down nutrient reductions within the period studied. Simultaneous changes in agricultural production (e.g. regional specialisation) and in climate may also have counteracted the effects of agri-environmental measures. The actions to reduce agricultural loading might have been more successful had they focused specifically on the areas and actions that contribute most to the current loading.;",

    "abstract": "The weed flora in conventionally and organically grown spring cereals was investigated in southern and central Finland during 20072009. The survey was conducted in 16 regions, 283 farms and 595 fields (72 organically cropped and 523 conventionally cropped fields, of which 503 were treated with herbicides). The occurrence of weeds was assessed in late Julyearly August. Altogether 148 weed species were identified, of which 128 were broad-leaved and 20 grass species. In organically cropped fields, the average species number per field was 21 and the most frequent species were Chenopodium album 96%, Stellaria media 94%, Viola arvensis 94% and Elymus repens 89%. In conventionally cropped fields, the average species number was 12 and the most frequent weed species were Viola arvensis 83%, Stellaria media 65%, Galeopsis spp. 59% and Galium spurium 59%. The average density of weeds was 160 m-2 (median = 112) in sprayed conventional fields and 519 m-2 (468) in organic fields. The average air-dry biomass of weeds was 167 kg ha-1 (median = 82) and 775 kg ha-1 (563), respectively. Elymus repens, the most frequent and abundant grass species, produced the highest proportion (about 30%) of the total weed biomass in both cropping systems. The frequency of Galium spurium in conventional cropping and Fumaria officinalis in organic cropping had increased substantially since the previous survey in 19971999. The average size of the weed seedbank in the 5 cm surface layer was about 1 700 seeds m-2, the most predominant seeds being of C. album. Although the weed flora in Finnish spring cereal fields consists of numerous species, only a fraction of them severely threaten crop production in terms of their frequency and abundance. Weeds in conventional cropping were effectively controlled with available herbicides whereas weed management in organic cropping calls for urgent measures such as direct mechanical weed control in crop stands, which was not practised at all in survey fields.;",

The N balance calculation was based on data for Finnish Rural Centres and calculated per cultivated hectare. The main data inputs for the calculations were agricultural and environmental statistics, coefficients of manure excretion and crop N concentrations. Finnish national net N balance decreased from 90 kg ha1 in 1990 to 50 kg ha1 in 2005. The decrease in regional N balances was of the same magnitude. The main reason for the lower N balances was reduced use of mineral N fertilisers. Variation in the N balances was due to yield levels varying according to growing season conditions. The Rural Centres with intensive animal production tended to generate the highest N balances.;",

This study discusses such models and the properties associated with them based on a review of 78 prioritisation studies.

The geographical locations of the studies are primarily North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Half of the studies were conducted during the past five years. The review finds that there generally seems to be several prioritisation models, especially in the case of invasive plants, but only a select few models are used extensively. Impacts are often accounted for in the model, but the extent and economic sophistication of their inclusion varies. Treatment of uncertainty and feasibility of control was lacking from many studies.;",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) gross balance is one of the indicators designed for following developments in agriculture in the European Union. A nutrient surplus occurs when the quantity of a nutrient applied in fertilizers is greater than that removed during harvest. In this study the usefulness of N balance in studying the fate of N and controlling N leaching from agricultural fields in south-western Finland was evaluated. To estimate N leaching in 20002005 the mathematical, process-based model COUP was applied to twelve fields representing four agricultural production sectors. The fields represented conventional cereal production, organic cereal production and both conventional cattle and pig husbandry. Simulated N leaching was lowest from cereal production fields with a low N balance. Higher N leaching from pig and cattle production farms might be reduced by decreasing the N balance but also by applying manure in spring instead of autumn. Both N balance and simulated N leaching from organic farm were relatively high compared to low N application rate to the fields. N balance appears to be a rather useful indicator of N leaching over longer periods of time. In the short term, N leaching depends mainly on precipitation and on cultivation practices, like timing and amount of fertilizer application. Statistical evaluation indicated significant positive correlation between calculated N balance and simulated N leaching, especially when supported by constant values of precipitation and N mineralization rate. Decrease of N balance by 1 kg ha1yr1 decreased N leaching by 0.3 kg ha1yr1. High positive N balances are conducive to abundant accumulation of residual N in soil and consequently to a high risk of N leaching during rainy seasons.;",

Positive PCR results have also been obtained from bait plants grown in soil collected from locations where diseased Fragaria x ananassa plants had earlier been destroyed. In the mid-1990s, there was an epidemic of foliar rust caused by the Asian basidiomycete Melampsoridium hiratsukanum on Alnus glutinosa and A. incana. Recently, two ascomycetes that have been introduced are Dothistroma septosporum (responsible for red band needle blight on Pinus sylvestris) and Chalara fraxinea (causing ash decline on Fraxinus excelsior).;",

Positive influence of biostimulant treatment on yield parameters was observed along with significant decrease in incidence of blossom-end rot (BER) in two pepper cultivars. Biostimulants application resulted in overall increase in macro- and microelement content in fruits of treated pepper cultivars. Generally, biostimulants improved the yield of pepper plants grown hydroponically by increasing the nutrient uptake and decreasing the occurrence of BER. Thus, the application of biostimulants could be considered as a good production strategy for obtaining high yields of nutritionally valuable vegetables with lower impact on the environment.",

    "abstract": "Global changes in food demand resulting from population growth and more meat-intensive diets require an increase in global protein crop production, not least as climate change and increasing scarcity of fresh water could restrict future production. In contrast to many other regions, in Finland climate change could open new opportunities through enabling more diverse cropping systems. It is justified to re-enquire whether the extent and intensity of protein crop production are optimized, resources are used efficiently and sustainably, cropping systems are built to be resilient and whether ecological services that protein crops provide are utilized appropriately. This paper aims to analyze in a descriptive manner the biological grounds for sustainable intensification of protein crop production in Finland. Production security is considered by evaluating the effects of and likelihood for constraints typical for northern conditions, examining historical and recent crop failures and estimating ecosystem services that more extensive introduction of protein crops potentially provide for northern cropping systems now and in a changing climate. There is an evident potential to expand protein crop production sustainably to a couple of times its current area. In general, variability in protein yields tends to be higher for protein crops than spring cereals. Nevertheless, protein yield variability was not necessarily systematically higher for Finland, when compared with other European regions, as it was for cereals. Protein crops provide significant ecological services that further support their expanded production. By this means protein self-sufficiency remains unrealistic, but increased production of protein crops can be achieved. The expansion of rapeseed and legumes areas also seems to be economically feasible. From the economic viewpoint, an increase in domestic protein supply requires that farmers have economic incentives to a) cultivate protein-rich crops instead of cereals, and b) use them as animal feed instead of imported sources of protein. Environmental sustainability is an argument to justify economic support for protein-rich crops and thus increase their cultivation.",

Successful farmers also have a firm confidence in their managerial skills, a strong emphasis on instrumental and intrinsic values, and a high appreciation of farming as occupation.

Field trials compared the effects of MBM and mineral fertilizer on yield and quality of sugar beet (2008-2009) and carrot (2010-2011) in Finland. MBM fertilisation of sugar beet grown on clay loam and sandy clay soil gave 11.4% (2008) and 19.6% (2009) lower yields than mineral fertilizers. The lower root yield in 2008 was compensated by higher extractable sugar content and lower amino-N, K and Na in root but no such compensation in root quality was detected for 2009. Mixing MBM with mineral NPK fertilizers had similar effects as MBM-alone. MBM (80 kg N ha-1 2010 and 60 kg N ha-1 2011) together with K fertilizer (Patentkali®, 180 kg K ha-1) were applied for carrot to a fine sandy till soil in 2010 and sandy loam in 2011. MBM alone gave 14% lower total and marketable root yield than mineral fertilization. The lower yield was compensated by improved quality, lower NO3- content in the carrot and good storability. Adding extra fertilizer during growth or separating fertilization applications had no effect on root yield or quality. MBM performed in these cases mainly as an organic N fertilizer. The N supply from MBM is not sufficient for achieving same yields as with mineral fertilizers. The relative N efficiency of total N of MBM was 83% that of mineral fertilizers. MBM should be targeted on soils with low P status.We conclude that MBM is a reasonably competitive alternative to mineral fertilizers, and as a recycled fertilizer it is a good option for organic production.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of Trichoderma asperellum T34 to the plant uptake of phosphorus (P) from sparingly phytoavailable forms such as insoluble calcium (Ca) phosphates and phytates was studied. Two experiments with cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) on siliceous sand were performed involving two factors, namely: (i) P source, viz., KH2PO4, phytate (Ins6P), and phosphate rock (PR), and (ii) inoculation with T34. Liquid pure cultures of T34 were also used. T34 increased the total content in P of cucumber roots irrespective of the particular P form and enhanced total P uptake by plants with P supplied as Ins6P or PR. The increased phytase activity observed with T34 contributes to explain its favourable influence on the uptake of P supplied as Ins6P. Solubilization of Ca phosphates from PR was favoured by the slightly acidifying effect and the increased organic anion concentration promoted by the fungus in the plant growth media. It can be concluded that T34 can improve P nutrition in plants grown on media containing phytates or insoluble Ca phosphates as dominant P forms.",

Plant species differ in their tendency to accumulate Se. Se taken-up by plants is returned to soil in plant residues, but the bioavailability of organic Se in those residues is poorly known. We investigated the impact of inorganic (Na2SeO4), organic (Se-enriched stem and leaf residues) Se applications and also soil microbial respiration on the growth and Se concentrations of various plant organs of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) during its development from the rosette to the seed filling stage. Both inorganic and organic Se slightly improved plant growth and enhanced plant development. Inorganic Se was more bioavailable than the organic forms and resulted in 3-fold to 6-fold higher Se concentrations in the siliques. Inorganic Se in autoclaved soil tended to elevate the Se concentration in all plant parts and at all growth stages. The organic Se raised Se concentrations in plants much less effectively than the inorganic selenate. Therefore, the use of inorganic Se is still recommended for biofortification.",

We compared relationships between soil P extracted by acid ammonium acetate (AAAc-P) and water-soluble P (Pw) in laboratory, and AAAc-P and dissolved molybdatereactive P (DRP) in field runoff. The laboratory study suggested a close relationship (R2 = 0.87, n = 64) between AAAc-P and soluble P concentration in 1:100 (w/v) soil-to-water extracts, described by a linear equation:Pw (mg l1) =0.021 × AAAc-P (mg l1 soil) 0.015 (mg l1). In Lake Rehtijärvi cathcment, dominated by clayey soils, the AAAc-P content of field Ap horizon in a similar manner influenced the flow-weighted DRP concentration in surface runoff and drainflow:a 1 mg l1 increase in soil AAAc-P corresponded to 0.015 and 0.018 mg l1 increase in surface runoff and drainflow DRP, respectively. When the AAAc-P vs.Pw relationship obtained in the laboratory test was used to predict the average DRP concentration in edge-of-field runoff, the precision of the DRP estimates inferred from STP data was in 95% of the cases ± 0.10 mg l1. In the L. Rehtijärvi catchment, 50% of the diffuse DRP loading risk was assigned to an area that corresponded to less than 20% of the fields and the situation may be similar in the national scale.;",

The FA diets significantly decreased silage intake, increased milk yield, decreased milk protein content, increased the concentrations of C18:0, C18:1, and C20:1 and decreased those of C8-16, and C18:3 fatty acids in milk fat. The FA diets also increased the concentration of nonesterified fatty acids in plasma, and decreased the digestibility of organic matter and neutral detergent fibre but increased that of fat. Glycerol decreased the molar proportion of acetate and increased the molar proportions of propionate and butyrate in the rumen, but the addition of glycerol did not have any effect on silage intake, milk yield or milk composition. Milk yield was highest when glycerol and free fatty acids were given together, showing a positive interaction.",

Even soils of the warmest areas in southern Finland and the mineral soils of the coldest areas in the north, at least for the most part, have cryic soil temperature regimes. Therefore, most soils of Finland, classified according to Soil Taxonomy, have names where the cryic temperature regime appears on the suborder or great group level.;",

One important attribute of many LAB is their ability to produce antimicrobial compounds called bacteriocins. Interest in these compounds has grown substantially due to their potential usefulness as natural substitutes for chemical food preservatives in the production of foods with enhanced shelflife and/or safety. There is growing consumer awareness of the link between diet and health. Recent scientific evidence supports the role of probiotic LAB in mediating many positive health effects.

The aim of this study was to verify that oosporederived epidemics actually occur in Finland. For this purpose, 20 suspected foci of oospore-derived potato late blight were scouted in 20002002. All of these were located in fi elds in which late blight had been observed in at least one of the four previous years. Primary symptoms in these foci occurred always on the lowest leaves near or touching the ground. Leafl ets typically showing numerous primary infections or lesions were in direct contact with the soil. In the former, oospores were observed after incubation. Soil samples from two experimental fi elds, marked by severe epidemics in most years during the last decade, caused infections in a bioassay. Both mating types were on every occasion present in groups of single lesion isolates collected from foci and the bioassay. Oospores survived over the winter, as shown by soil samples taken during the spring that infected potato leafl ets in the bioassay. The results presented indicate that oospore-derived epidemics occur in Finland. This paper also discusses the role of oospores in causing blight epidemics in Finland compared to more southern countries.;",

Hot water was used to extract B and Se. From 1987 to 1998, soil P, Ca, Mg, S, Cr, Cu, Zn, volume weight and electrical conductivity increased and soil K, B, pH and organic C decreased. There was no change in soil Al, Cd, Mn and Ni. Between 1987 and 1998,the use of P,K,B and Cu in mineral fertilisers declined whereas that of Ca in liming agents and Zn in mineral fertilisers increased. With the exception of P and Cu,these changes affected the concentrations of easily soluble macro- and micronutrients in the soil accordingly. The slight decrease in soil pH might be due to the increase in the use of fertliser N. The finding that soil Cd and Ni ceased to increase and that soil Cr increased only slightly was attributed to the dramatic reduction in national emissions and bulk depositions of heavy metals.;",

In one experiment the treatments were RSM and soybean meal (SBM), while in another experiment forage was either grass silage or bam dried hay cut at the same maturity. In addition, this was compared to the data of other trials in Finland during the last ten years, in which RSM supplementation had been used. Using this data the response in terms of milk yield to RSM supplementation was estimated. The utilization of protein in milk production was estimated by the Nordic AAT-PBV protein evaluation system. During the experiments (1983-1990) the varieties of turnip rape were changed from high glucosinolate, containing single-zero, to low glucosinolate containing doublezero varieties, while the glucosinolate content was reduced from 40-50 μmoles to 14 μmoles per g of defatted meal. Heat-moisture treatment (™Öpex) further reduced the glucosinolate content by half. By replacing grain with RSM in the concentratemixture with ad libitum silage feeding, the silage intake increased by 0.43 kg per kg increase in RSM on the basis of dry matter (DM) (non significant).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the contents of trichothecenes in representative samples of oats during official variety, nitrogen fertilization and organic farming trials in Finland, 19971999. Further objectives were to promote industry and commerce by selection of high-quality oat varieties for various applications. The official variety trials conducted at 810 locations were managed following standard protocol. There were 2 types of agronomy trial, the first included comparison of oat cultivars grown in conventional and organic farming systems at 6 locations, and the second used 5 nitrogen rates (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg N ha-1) at 2 locations. Regardless of wet cold summer occurring in Finland during 1998, the concentrations of Fusarium toxins were lowest during this 3 year monitoring period. More mycotoxins were produced during the warm, dry summers of 1997 and 1999 than in 1998. In all, 55% of the oat samples in the official variety trials contained deoxynivalenol (DON) within the range of 50 896 µ g kg-1. The differences in DON concentrations between organic and conventional cultivation were small. The results showed also that the use of various nitrogen fertilization levels only slightly affected the trichothecene concentrations. The contents of trichothecenes in Finnish grains appeared to be similar to or lower than those reported earlier in the Northern Hemisphere.;",

Experimental sites were situated on different soils: soil pHKCl at Kärla was 5.5 and at Vasula 6.2. Elemental sulphur and acidifying fertilizers (ammonium sulfate, potassium sulfate and superphosphate) were used in both plantations. Fertilizers were applied based on nutrient in the soil and sulphur was applied at 100 g m2. Plant growth was recorded in 2001, 2002 and 2003. A positive influence of NPK fertilization on yield was found in both Kärla and Vasula, and yield were 336 g and 41 g higher compared to the control, respectively. The vegetative growth and yield of blueberry depended significantly on soil pH. Elemental sulphur increased soil acidity and on loamy sand soil did not increase plant productivity. The sulphur effect on soil pH began to decrease three years after application. Sulphur can be recommended to increase soil acidity in nutrient-rich soil but, not nutrient poor soil with light texture, where only NPK fertilizers were effective.;",

The largest energy input was used in the processing of the biofuels while most of the greenhouse gases were emitted during farming. The GHG emissions of the field-based biogas were emitted mainly from fuels of farming machinery, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions of the soil and the production of ensiling additives. The energy efficiency was most sensitive to the methane yield, and GHG emissions to the N2O emissions.

Accumulating evidence suggests the suitability of BTO as a biocide or repellent in terrestrial environments for the control of weeds, insects, molluscs and rodents. Once applied as biocide, BTO may end up, either through run-off or leaching, in aquatic systems and may have adverse effects on non-target organisms. As very little is known about the toxicity of BTO to aquatic organisms, the present study investigated acute toxicity (LC50/EC50) of BTO for eight aquatic organisms. Bioassays with the Asellus aquaticus (crustacean), Lumbriculus variegatus (oligochaeta worm), Daphnia magna (crustacean), Lymnea sp. (mollusc), Lemna minor (vascular plant), Danio rerio (fish), Scenedesmus gracilis (algae), and Vibrio fischeri (bacterium) were performed according to ISO, OECD or USEPA-guidelines. The results indicated that BTO was practically nontoxic to most aquatic organisms as the median effective BTO concentrations against most organisms were &gt;150 mg L-1. In conclusion, our toxicity tests showed that aquatic organisms are to some extent, invariably sensitive to birch tar oil, but suggest that BTO does not pose a severe hazard to aquatic biota. We deduce that, unless BTOs are not applied in the immediate vicinity of water bodies, no special precaution is required.;",

    "abstract": "The study explored how economic, technical and allocative input efficiencies in specialized Swedish dairy farms are affected by differences in farm size. The efficiency analysis showed that costs could decrease by 30% if all farms were as efficient as the best farms in the sample. The effect of farm size was analysed in second-stage regressions. Two measures of farm size were considered: income from dairy and the number of hectares, together with squared measures of both size measures and variables to control for geographic location. The results showed that the relationships between farm size and efficiency can be described as non-linear, where efficiency first tends to decrease with size and then increase. The average scale efficiency was 94.7%, suggesting that, on average, the farms are close to their optimal scale. The paper concludes by suggesting that farm efficiency can be increased both by focusing on increasing the knowledge about how inputs can be more optimally combined and by growth of the farms. However, the latter suggestion requires farm growth aiming at the larger farm segments.;",

    "abstract": "Several mealybug species reacted positively towards light and high humidity. Planococcoides njalensis (Laing) had a thermopreferendum at 20-25°C. and 25-33° C. was optimum for reproduction with a partial fecundity of 92 nymphs per female. T ½ biol. of 32P in the species was 11.4—15.3 days. Food uptake from virus infected plants was positively related to the infectivity of P. njalensis with cocoa swollen shoot virus isolate 1A. Plant and mealybug radioactivity were positively correlated. Amount of honeydew excreted by the species and the radioactivity of the honeydew were positively correlated. Frequency distribution of 32P in P. njalensis after feeding on 32P-active seedlings or sucrose solution was similar. Radiation effects on infectivity of mealybugs were not detected at 30 µCi/ml of 32P in seedling culture solution. With CSSV 1A and P. njalensis, preliminary fasting increased the rate of settling down to feed, the food uptake and infectivity of mealybugs. Virus was transmitted more often from stems than leaves of source plants. Groups of seedlings of 29—54 days old were almost equally good sources of virus for mealybugs and availability varied more between individual source plants. Mealybugs removed their stylets from source plants in 240 seconds. The length of acquisition access time for maximum transmission was 48—72 hours. Virus was not acquired during short feeds of up to one hour. Virus was acquired from infected seedlings by mealybugs via a parafilm membrane. Acquisition of virus from liquid leaf extract was rare. Virus persisted in mealybugs up to 72—96 hours and loss of infectivity was exponential with a T 1/2 of 12—13 hours. Virus persisted in the mealybugs through postacquisition moulting. Mealybugs vere seemingly more efficient vectors after postacquisition feeding than fasting, Latent period of virus in the test plants was short and over 98 % of the test plants showed virus symptoms in three months. With different numbers of mealybugs on test plants during the inoculation feed, the infection rate was as expected. The use of mealybugs while testing virus resistant and tolerant cocoa is demonstrated. Location of feeding mealybugs on test beans did not influence the infection rate. Virus transmission by mealybugs was not affected by light or darkness. The food uptake was highest and virus was transmitted most often in 29—36°C. The transmission of CSSV isolate 1M or cocoa mottle leaf virus isolate 1C with P. njalensis as the vector, or CSSV 1A with Ferrisia virgata (Cockerell) was similar to that of CSSV 1A with P. njalensis as the vector. A formula is given to describe the increase of infectivity in mealybugs during acquisition feed.",

    "abstract": "Sustainability is a multidimensional concept that entails economic, environmental, and social aspects. The sustainable value (SV) method is one of the most promising attempts to quantify sustainability performance of firms. SV compares performance of a firm to a benchmark, which must be estimated in one way or another. This paper examines alternative parametric and nonparametric methods for estimating the benchmark technology from empirical data. Reviewed methods are applied to an empirical data of 332 Finnish dairy farms. The application reveals four interesting conclusions. First, the greater flexibility of the nonparametric methods is evident from the better empirical fit. Second, negative skewness of the regression residuals of both parametric OLS and nonparametric CNLS speaks against the average-practice benchmark technology in this application. Third, high positive correlations across a wide spectrum of methods suggest that the findings are relatively robust. Forth, the stochastic decomposition of the disturbance term to filter out the noise component from the inefficiency term yields more realistic efficiency estimates and performance targets.;",

The majority of the respondents preferred domestic apples (91% and 81% in 2007 and 2012, respectively), the main motivation being food safety: domestic apples were believed to contain fewer chemical residues. Apple taste was the most important quality attribute, followed by appearance which was rated equally important as health benefits and finally, price. Young people (&lt;25 years) were significantly more indifferent towards apple origin compared to others. However, the preference for apple taste and colour was similar in all age groups. Over the five year period surveyed, the preference for domestic and organic apples had decreased, but taste and colour preference had remained unchanged.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper the routine determination of soil pH in the laboratory was studied using a material of 15 soil samples of various kind and in addition, two larger soil groups, consisting of 80 and 406 samples respectively. In comparing the pH values determined in water and in 0.01 M CaCl2 suspensions, the latter proved to be almost independent of the soil/liquid ratio between 1: 2.5 and 1: 10, that markedly affected the pHH2O values. The change with time from the pH values measured after the first hour showed less variation in CaCl2 suspensions than in water suspensions; the constancy observed in pHCaCl2 values indicating that a relatively short equilibration period of 1—2 hours would be sufficient. To sum up these results, the use of 0.01 M CaCl2 would mean easy and accurate measurements well suited to mass pH determinations. A linear relationship and a highly significant positive correlation was found between pHH2O and pHCaCl2 values in a material of 406 soil samples. The difference between the two values, which largely depends on the soils’ own salt content, ranged from 0 to 1.1 pH units, with the mean difference of 0.49. Therefore, the suggested use of a constant correction factor to bring the pHCaCl2 values to the level of the pH measured in water, is not recommendable. The main advantage of using 0.01 M CaCl2 would be the concealing of differences in salt content of a soil. The use of pHCaCl2 values would also offer new ways for getting more information about a soil’s exchange capacities, as it provides the center point for TERÄSVUORI’s (13) soil curve.",

    "abstract": "Modern dairy production is inevitably associated with impacts to the environment and the challenge for the industry today is to increase production to meet growing global demand while minimising emissions to the environment. Negative environmental impacts include gaseous emissions to the atmosphere, of ammonia from livestock manure and fertiliser use, of methane from enteric fermentation and manure management, and of nitrous oxide from nitrogen applications to soils and from manure management. Emissions to water include nitrate, ammonium, phosphorus, sediment, pathogens and organic matter, deriving from nutrient applications to forage crops and/or the management of grazing livestock. This paper reviews the sources and impacts of such emissions in the context of a forage-based dairy farm and considers a number of potential mitigation strategies, giving some examples using the farm-scale model SIMSDAIRY. Most of the mitigation measures discussed are associated with systemic improvements in the efficiency of production in dairy systems. Important examples of mitigations include: improvements to dairy herd fertility, that can reduce methane and ammonia emissions by up to 24 and 17%, respectively; diet modification such as the use of high sugar grasses for grazing, which are associated with reductions in cattle N excretion of up to 20% (and therefore lower N losses to the environment) and potentially lower methane emissions, or reducing the crude protein content of the dairy cow diet through use of maize silage to reduce N excretion and methane emissions; the use of nitrification inhibitors with fertiliser and slurry applications to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching by up to 50%. Much can also be achieved through attention to the quantity, timing and method of application of nutrients to forage crops and utilising advances made through genetic improvements.",

Foliar application of B at the beginning of bud formation in winter oilseed rape increased seed yield by 0.19 (3%) at the lower B fertilization level to 0.26 Mg ha-1 (4%) at the higher B fertilization level. The observed increase in the yield of winter oilseed rape seeds in response to foliar application of B can be attributed to this micronutrient’s positive influence on seed production in siliques. Foliar fertilization with B increased B content and decreased Zn and Fe levels in the seeds of winter oilseed rape. When B fertilizer was applied at the rate of 150–300 g ha-1, the N and Ca content of the evaluated seeds increased. The fertilizer improved the nutritional value (crude fat content, fatty acid concentrations) of seeds, but deteriorated their feed value (total protein content, acid detergent fiber concentrations, neutral detergent fiber concentrations, quantitative and qualitative composition of glucosinolates).",

    "abstract": "An attempt was made to study to what extent the capacity of the more or less acid soils in Finland to sorb phosphate may be explained on the basis of their content of aluminium and iron. The indicator of the phosphate sorption capacity was calculated on the basis of the Freundlich adsorption isotherm according to the procedure proposed by TERÄSVUORI (8). The material consisted of 390 samples from cultivated and virgin soils representing both topsoils and subsoils. The indicator of the phosphate sorption capacity, the coefficient k, varied in the present material from 40 to 1510. The mean values (with the confidence limits at the 95 per cent level) were for the 109 samples of sand and fine sand soils 290 ± 17, for the 103 samples of loam and silt soils 201 ± 24, for the 151 clay soils 308 ± 20, and for the 27 humus soils 236 ± 41. The total linear correlation coefficients between k and the soil pH, and its contents of organic carbon or clay were low or negligible in most of the soil groups. The correlation of k with the content of aluminium extracted by Tamm’s acid ammonium oxalate was fairly close in the clay soils (r = 0.84***), lower in the sand and fine sand soils (r = 0.77***), and in the loam and silt soils, and in the humus soils it was rather poor (r = 0.65*** and 0.63*** resp.). The elimination of the effect of the ammonium oxalate soluble iron decreased the correlation in the two latter groups quite markedly (to 0.32** and 0.37 resp.), while the corresponding decrease in the coefficients for the former groups was less significant (to 0.64*** and 0.75*** resp.). The elimination of the effect of the ammonium oxalate soluble aluminium, on the other hand, decreased the correlation coefficients between k and the ammonium oxalate soluble iron in the sand and fine sand soils from 0.59*** to 0.26**, in the loam and silt soils from 0.73*** to 0.54***, in the clay soils from 0.70*** to 0.51***, and in the humus soils from 0.68*** to 0.49*. The part of variation in k which could be explained on the basis of the variation in the contents of aluminium and iron was different in the different kind of soils. According to the coefficients of determination and the coefficients of multiple determination, the variance in the aluminium content determined 59 per cent of the variance in k in the sand and fine sand soils and 70 per cent in the clay soils; considering also the content of iron increased this part to 61 per cent and 78 per cent, resp. In the loam and silt soils the variation in the iron content explained 53 per cent of the variation in k, in the humus soils this percentage was 47. Considering both aluminium and iron, the proportion of the variance in k which could be explained in these two groups was increased to 60 per cent and 54 per cent, resp. Thus, in addition to the contents of ammonium oxalate soluble iron and aluminium, other factors must be found to explain the variation in the phosphate sorption capacity, particularly in other soil groups than in the clay soils. The soil pH and its content of organic carbon obviously play only a minor role among these ctors.",

Delaying incorporation of the green manure crop in autumn lessened the risk of N leaching. The higher the crop N and soil NO3-N content, the greater the risk of leaching. Incorporation in the following spring, which lessened the risk of N leaching as compared with early autumn ploughing, often had an adverse effect on the growth of the succeeding crop.

    "abstract": "Wheat is the only temperate cereal for which yield trends have been exhaustively analysed on both global and national bases. This paper aims (i) to compare global yield trends of wheat, barley, oat and rye for the last five decades, (ii) to analyse their yield trends in Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, the northernmost limits for extensive agriculture, and (iii) using case studies, to assess the relative contribution to yield gains made by cereal breeding. Average global yield data from FAO were regressed against years using linear or bilinear regressions. Yield gains in absolute and relative terms were calculated for comparison among countries and cereals. Data from the literature were used to assess the estimated contributions made by breeding to yield gains. Global yield trends were not standard throughout the 1950-1998 period: rye exhibited a constant yield gain (c. 28 kg ha-1 y-1), while barley and oat showed marked increases until around 1970 (c. 38 and 32 kg ha-1 y-1, respectively) but quite modest increases (c.19 and 5 kg ha-1 y-1, respectively) over the last 30 years. Wheat also showed a bilinear trend with only limited yield gains until the 1960s, followed by a more than 3-fold increase in rate of yield gain from then on (16 and 40 kg ha-1 y-1, respectively). However, during the 1990s wheat yield gains have been less than previously. Hence, global yields of barley, oat and wheat have increased very slowly lately. Trends for each combination of cereals and countries indicated consistently higher yields during the 1990s than at mid-century. In general, wheat yield tended to increase at a faster rate than yield of the other cereals. There was a trend in the last decade of low rates of yield increase compared with those of previous decades. This was clear for oat and barley, and a similar trend is emerging for wheat. This suggests that genetic and/or management improvements have had less effect in recent times. Furthermore, we found preliminary evidence to suggest that with the exception of wheat in Canada, genetic contributions in northern areas were smaller than those reported for wheat and barley at lower latitudes. Therefore, alternative approaches must be sought for future breeding work under these high latitude conditions. ;",

The Se contents of oats were significantly higher in 1999 probably due to the combined effect of not increased fertilizer level (from 6 to 10 mg Se kg-1 fertilizer) and very low precipitation in 1999. The Se contents of oats were significantly lower in organic cultivation, due to the absence of Se-supplemented fertilization. Significant (P &lt; 0.001) cultivar differences were detected in official variety trials. The cultivars Veli and Leila showed higher levels of Se.;",

Four primiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows fitted with cannulae in the rumen and duodenum were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square experiment with four 28-d experimental periods and 2 × 2 factorial arrangements of treatments. Using red clover-containing (40%) silage rather than pure grass silage had minor effects on rumen fermentation or diet digestion but increased non-ammonia nitrogen (N) flow in terms of increased flows of microbial and dietary N entering to the small intestine. This was reflected as a reduced ruminal N degradability on grass-red clover diets. Furthermore, grass-red clover diets in comparison to grass silage diets increased milk lactose concentration and yields of milk, protein and lactose. Feeding oats in replacement for barley had minor effects on rumen fermentation or post-ruminal non-ammonia N flows but reduced digestibility of organic matter and neutral detergent fibre in the diet. Using oats rather than barley increased yields of milk and lactose but reduced milk protein concentration. Oats also increased proportions of C18:0 and C18:1 in milk fat and reduced those of C10:0 to C16:0. It is concluded that inclusion of red clover and replacement of barley with oats in grass silage based diets have beneficial effects in dairy cow production.;",

    "abstract": "Ten dairy cows in early lactation were given five different supplements with grass silage ad libitum according to two 5x5 Latin square designs. The supplements consisted of barley (Ba), unmolassed sugar beet pulp (SBP) and molasses (Mo) on dry matter (DM) basis as follows: (A) Ba 1000g, (B) Ba 667 g and Mo 326 g, (C) Ba 417 g, SBP 410 g and Mo 163 g, (D) SBP 983 g and (E) 656 g SBP and 326 g Mo per kg. The lower fat content of SBP and molasses than of Ba was balanced with rapeseed oil. These supplements were fed at the level of 6 kg DM/d. In addition, 1 kg of rapeseed meal was given as a protein supplement. No differences in silage DM intake between the Ba and SBP supplements were found, but inclusion of a high level of Mo depressed silage and total DM intake. Cows given SBP supplements yielded 1.1kg (P &lt; 0.01) more milk and 32 g (P &lt; 0.05) more protein than those given Ba supplements. Milk fat concentration was lower (P &lt; 0.001) on SBP (46.0 g/kg) than on Ba diets (49.1 g/kg) and thus there was no difference in the yield of fat corrected milk(FCM) and milk fat between the two supplements. Inclusion of 2 kg of DM of More reduced the milk (P &lt; 0.001), FCM, fat and protein yields (P &lt; 0.01) compared to diets without molasses. Supplement C increased (P &lt; 0.05) the milk yield compared to the other diets but the milk composition was not affected. The effect of supplements on the digestibility of the ration was determined using acid insoluble ash as a marker. The apparent digestibility of organic matter averaged 0.743 and was not significantly affected by the diet. Digestibility of neutral detergent fibre was higher (P &lt; 0.001) for SBP diets (0.680) than for Ba diets (0.596). Similar differences were observed in the digestibility of other fibre components. However, the digestibility of the silage was not affected by the treatment. Feeding SBP diets resulted in lower (P &lt; 0.001) digestibility of crude protein than did Ba diets. Metabolizable energy (ME) of SBP diets tended to be used more efficiently for milk synthesis than ME of Ba diets. Inclusion of Mo in Ba or SBP did not reduce the efficiency, although the milk yield was decreased. The passage rate of liquid was determined with CoEDTA and that of particles with Cr-labelled straw. The average mean retention time of liquid ranged from 18.0 to 19.9 h and that of particles from 36.8 to 37.7h. Neither time was affected by the treatment. The passage rate of particles from the rumen ranged from 0.045 to 0.048 and that of liquid from 0.096 to 0.104, irrespective of the diet.",

The sulphur fractions are recovered as either Ag2S or BaSO4 precipitates and can further be used for isotope analysis. Overlaps between sulphur species are common during speciation, and must be minimized. Some of these overlaps are caused by poor sampling and storage, inappropriate conditions during the distillation, or natural variations in the sample (e.g. Fe3+ interference and grain size). The procedural impact was determined by conducting tests on both artificial and natural samples containing one or several sulphur species. The method is applied on reduced sediment from an AS soil locality (Överpurmo) and a brackish lake (Larsmo Lake) in western Finland and the results, including S-isotopes, are discussed.;",

Total fruit biomass was higher in mineral fertilized plants compared to urine fertilized and non-fertilized pumpkins. Urine fertilized pumpkins may have suffered from lower potassium or higher chloride, thus they produced fewer flowers and fruits. However, total fruit biomass and the number of fruits were slightly higher in urine fertilized plants than in their non-fertilized counterparts, i.e. 17.2 t ha-1 more pumpkin could be produced with urine fertilizer. The microbial hygiene quality as well as the contents of soluble sugars, protein and taste quality were similar in all treatments, but lower nitrate and higher chloride contents were recorded in urine fertilized pumpkins than other treatments.

This has resulted in considerable aesthetic and economic damage to plants in home gardens and commercial nurseries. Birch tar oil (BTO), is a new biological plant protection product, and was tested against these molluscs. In this study we examined whether 2 types of BTO, used either alone, mixed together, or mixed with Vaseline®, could be applied as 1) a biological plant protection product for the control of land snails by direct topical spray application, 2) as a repellent against snails when painted on a Perspex® fence, and 3) as a repellent against slugs when smeared on pots containing Brassica pekinensis seedlings. Both the fences and the pots with seedlings were placed in each field with a high population of the target organism. When applied as a spray on snails, BTO did not act as a toxic pesticide but rendered the snails inactive for a period of several months. The BTO barriers were effective in repelling both snails and slugs. However, the repellent effect of BTO alone against the molluscs was short-term. Repeated treatments were required to keep the slugs away from the plants and we found that the interval between treatments should not exceed two weeks. A collar fastened around the rim of the pots, combined with the BTO treatment, did not give any additional benefit in hindering slugs from invading the plants. Most noticeably, the BTO+Vaseline® mixture prevented the land snails from passing over the treated fences for up to several months. The results of these experiments provide evidence that BTO, especially when mixed with Vaseline®, serves as an excellent long-term repellent against molluscs.;",

    "abstract": "In many parts of the world, rural development is supported by third sector organizations, such as nongovernmental organizations, farmer associations, and cooperatives. This essay develops a transaction cost explanation of these organizations role in rural areas. Since the traditional transaction cost theory is concerned with the choice of governance mechanisms within the for-profit sector, this essay adopts an alternative conceptualization of the notion of transaction cost by building on the theory of the division of labor. This theory regards transaction cost as a constraint on the division of labor causing the replacement of exchange with self-sufficiency. The proposed transaction cost explanation of rural third sector organizations consists of two arguments: 1) third sector organizations embody partial reliance on self-sufficiency; and 2) rural areas exhibit rurality-specific transaction cost acting as a constraint on the division of labor and thus creating a niche for third sector organizations. The essay concludes with suggesting a research program on developing an economic theory of the rural third sector.;",

Due to its novelty as a biocide/repellent/plant protection product, no comprehensive information on the effects of BTO on non-target soil organisms is available. In this study we examined the impact of BTO on non-target soil organisms (enchytraeids, nematodes and soil microbes) and plants using laboratory toxicity tests and field experiments. In addition, we determined the LC50 value of BTO to the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa and the EC50 value of BTO to the offspring production of the collembolan Folsomia candida. The effects of BTO on soil fauna were mostly insignificant. BTO seemed to be detrimental to the growth of plants directly after application, but this effect was short-term; after a period of 2.5 months, the growth of most of the plant species recovered completely from the application. The LC50 for A. caliginosa was 6560 mg BTO kg-1 dry soil and EC50 for juvenile production of F. candida was 5100 mg BTO kg-1 dry soil. The results indicate that the risk caused by BTOs (concentration 500-1360 L ha-1) to the soil environment is insignificant and short-term as compared to the many chemical products applied for similar purposes.;",

We used long-term yield datasets of FAO for Finland (1960s to date) and MTT Agrifood Research Finland (MTT) Official Variety Trial datasets on yield and quality of major field crops in Finland since the 1970s. Yield variability was exceptionally high in the 1980s and 1990s, but previously and subsequently national yields were clearly more stable. No progressive increase in yield variability was recorded. No marked and systematic changes in variability of quality traits were recorded, except for rapeseed, which exhibited reduced variability in seed chlorophyll content. This may at least partly attribute to the differences in intensity of input use and thereby responsiveness of the crops before and after 1980 and 1990 decades. We also noted that in the 2000s average temperatures were higher than in earlier decades and this was the case for all months of the growing season except June, which represents, however, the most critical phase for yield determination in most of the field crops in Finland. Also in the 2000s precipitation increased in the first three months of the growing season and thereafter decreased, but without signs of significantly increased numbers of heavy showers (extreme rain events). Hence, in general constant, increased average temperatures during the growing seasons of the 2000s were identified, but with reduced yield variability, which was partly attributable to the diminished use of inputs, especially fertilisers.;",

The perception of lactic acid taste to trained judges was higher in samples of major concentration and immersion time. To untrained judges the sample treated with 3% lactic acid for 1 minute, had the best acceptation. Both judges reported that the taste of meat was delicious.

The relative proportions of the different structural units of the hemicellulose have also been determined. Furthermore, a method is proposed for the determination of the cell-wall complex in cereals. Oat and barley differ from wheat and rye to an appreciable extent only in respect of the hull. The hulls consist of strawlike material rich in lignin, cellulose and xylan; they are richer in xylan than the straw proper. The fruit and seed coat enveloping the seed (viz. the bran) contains relatively small amounts of lignin and cellulose. The bran is chiefly composed of hemicellulose with xylose and arabinose as the main components. The main compound of the endosperm is starch, although some hemicellulose and protein are present, whereas only minor amounts of cellulose and lignin can be found. In the samples investigated only small differences were noted between the compositions of wheat, rye, dehulled oat and dehulled barley; wheat had the highest starch content, rye the highest hemicellulose content, and oat the highest contents of crude protein and lignin. The cell-wall complex determined as the residue after enzymatic hydrolysis of the starch agreed well with that obtained by fractionation. On the other hand, the detergent-fibre values differed from the fractionation results considerably, and the conventional crude fibre analysis yielded results which were about 1.5 times that of cellulose. The feed-values of the different grain parts are discussed on the basis of the analysis results obtained.",

A field survey of occurrence of clubroot in oilseed fields was conducted in Finland in 2007−2009 and in 1984−1989. At present, the disease is distributed throughout the oilseed cultivation area. Clubroot was found on average from 30% of fields, but its severity was low; fields with high numbers of infected plants and plants with severe symptoms were rare. According to the survey, cultivation frequency of cruciferous plants is the most important factor affecting clubroot occurrence and severity. Clubroot was found in soils with a wide range of pH-values (pH 5-7.6), but symptoms were most severe at low pH. According to the survey, and greenhouse and field trials, high temperature and moisture during the early growth period seem to favour disease development and can cause significant yield losses. In a survival trial, clubroot declined to close to zero after four years in the absence of host plants, but traces of the pathogen were still detectable after a 19-year trial period, making eradication of the pathogen very difficult.",

The largest energy saving potential was identified in milk cooling and the heating of cleaning water. Even simple methods, such as placing the condenser of the refrigeration system outside, may reduce the energy consumption of milk cooling by 30%. Efficient milk pre-cooling can reduce the energy consumption of the whole milking process by more than 25%. Even larger energy savings are possible with a sophisticated milk cooling – water heating systems. It was concluded that there is a significant potential to reduce the energy consumption and energy costs of the milking process, and thus to improve the profitability and sustainability of the sector at the same time.",

The transition would require the support of horizontal measures that can be implemented throughout the food system. Shifting the emphasis toward the drivers of food demand and consumption will increase the role of new policy instruments and the actors involved in the food system. Collaborative research between environmental and nutritional sciences with economics and policy analysis is necessary to link nutritional health and environmental objectives with economic and social impacts. Less resource-demanding diets would reduce the impact from the food system and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Drastic changes in diets and food consumption in Finland would have an impact on primary agricultural production, but the output from the food processing industry would only be slightly affected. However, a successful transition would involve considerable investments in the agricultural and food industry.",

    "abstract": "Clay content and the ability to reversibly retain cations affect many essential chemical and physical properties of soil, such as pH buffering and carbon sequestration. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and base saturation are also commonly used as criteria in soil classification. However, determination of CEC and particle-size distribution is laborious and not included in routine soil testing. In this study, pedotransfer functions including soil test cations (STCat; Ca2+ + Mg2+ + K+), pH and soil organic carbon (SOC, %) as explanatory variables were developed for estimating CEC, titratable acidity (TA; H+ + Al3+) and clay content (clay, %). In addition, reference values for potential CEC and its components were determined for Finnish mineral and organic soils. The mean of potential CEC extracted by 1 M ammonium acetate at pH 7.0 ranged from 14 (range 6.4−25) in coarse soils to 33 (21−45) cmol(+) kg-1 in heavy clay soils, and from 42 (24−82) in mull soils to 77 (25−138) cmol(+) kg-1 in peat soils. The average CEC of clay and SOC were 27 and 160 cmol(+) kg-1, respectively. Titratable acidity occupied 53% and around 40% of the CEC sites in organic and mineral soils, respectively, evidencing that it is a prominent component of the potential CEC in these predominantly acidic soils. STCat, pH and SOC explained 96% of the variation in potential CEC. STCat and pH can be used in estimating the clay content especially for soils containing over 30% clay. In coarse textured soils, in contrast, SOC hampers the STCat based estimation of clay content.",

The total phosphorus content of all the samples was rather low and no regularity in the influence of the depth upon this quantity could be demonstrated. There seemed to be some tendency to an increase in the P-content with increasing depth in the peat lands of lower quality. In peat lands of higher quality the opposite often held true. A large part of the phosphorus occurred in organic form, and, almost without exception, this percentage of total phosphorus increased with the depth: in undecomposed plant material this proportion was about 50—60 per cent, in the surface layers 70 per cent, on the average, in deposits deeper than 50 cm seldom less than 80 per cent and it could even reach 95 per cent. 1he amount of organic phosphorus expressed as a percentage of organic dry matter was low in most of the samples and although it tended to increase with the depth only in 11 of all the 122 samples values higher than 0.1 per cent were obtained. Even if an allowance is made for the conditions prevailing in peat lands these low percentages of organic phosphorus indicate that, from the microbiological point of view, no rapid mineralization of the organic phosphorus compounds is probable. The inorganic phosphorus content was low and tended to decrease from the surface to deeper layers. The solubility of inorganic phosphorus, however, dropped much more drastically. Thus in the deeper layers the amount of easily extractable inorganic phosphorus could be negligible. The solubility of organic phosphorus also impaired with the depth. The phosphorus economy of peat lands was discussed on the basis of the results obtained.",

Diagnostic PCR assay specific to Dickeya solani, Pectobacterium atrosepticum, Pectobacterium carotovorum, P. brasiliense and P. parmentieri revealed that potatoes are infected by one or more of these species; it also revealed that single species infection is more common than multiple colonization.

    "abstract": "In the middle and northern parts of Sweden and Finland Gramineae-planti are infected by a fungus of Sclerotinia-genus which causes injury during the overwintering of the plants. Vleugel in Sweden described the fungus with the name Sclerotinia borealis Bubåk and Vleugel in 1917. In Sweden S. borealis has been met in several years causing injury to winter rye, timothy, cocksfoot and other field grasses. It occurs commonly in Norrland, especially in the country Norrbotten. The southern limit of its spreading area in Sweden is in latitude about 61° N. In Finland S. borealis is met in the middle and northern parts of the country. On the basis of the information hitherto the fungus is more or less general in the years favourable to its occurrence in the provinces of Lapland, Oulu, Kuopio and Mikkeli. When occurring more abundantly as happened during the overwintering 1945—46, S. borealis is in these regions one cause for the poor overwintering of winter rye, timothy and other grasses. The climatical conditions prevailing during autumn, winter and spring are of decisive bearing for the spreading of S. borealis as well as for its abundant occurrence in certain years. The development of the apothecia of the fungus and the spreading of the ascospores is evidently favoured by long, rainy autumn, the damages are promoted by low freezing of the soil and thick cover of snow in the winter as well as by slow melting of snow in the spring. Of the occurrence of S. borealis in different Gramineae-plants, see p. 133—134. Different varieties of winter cereals and species and strains of grasses vary greatly in resistance to S. borealis. It has been observed that, of the varieties of winter rye, especially the Finnish ones resist the disease caused by the fungus very well. Of field grasses, Phleum pratense, Dactylis glomerata, Lolhim perenne, Poa serotina, and P. trivialis are susceptible to S. borealis. Some strains of these species, however, are extremely well resistant to the fungus. The strains of the grasses and varieties of winter rye grown in the north are generally more resistant to the damages by the fungus. In developing new varieties of winter cereals and strains of field grasses for the northern conditions these facts must be duly considered and for the breeding work such material should be selected which has grown in the district where the fungus occurs. Obviously the damages caused by the fungus are less when the plants receive plenty of nutrients, especially phosphates whereby they become stronger to resist infections.",

    "abstract": "When the salt content of food is reduced a lack of flavor is anticipated to be the greatest problem related to consumer acceptance. The aim of this study was to examine how much the salt content of cooked ham can be reduced without a significant effect on sensory saltiness. Hams made up of coarsely ground pork with added phosphate were prepared and the cooking loss was determined. The salt content of the hams were 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3 and 2.6% NaCl. The saltiness intensity of cold hams was rated against a reference ham (1.7% NaCl) using a relative-to-standard scale. The cooking loss in ham made with 1.1% added salt was higher than in the other hams. The ham with 1.7% NaCl was rated as salty as the hams with 2.0 and 2.3% NaCl (P&gt;0.05), but saltier than those with 1.1 and 1.4% (P0.05). The results of this study suggest that based on saltiness evaluations it is possible to reduce the salt content of cooked ham to 1.7% NaCl.;",

To study their potential in Northern growing conditions PGRs and their application time impacts on plant stand structure and yield formation in tall and short statured cultivars of barley, oat, and wheat were studied in the field. Crop stands were sprayed with the gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitors CCC [chlormequat chloride CCC], Moddus [Trinexapac-ethyl TE], or with ethylene-releasing Cerone [ethephon ETH] at the recommended times or at an earlier growth stage. CCC applied at Zadoks growth scale (ZGS) 13-14 increased and ETH applied at ZGS 39-40 reduced grain yield of oat by 370 kg ha-1 and 270 kg ha-1, respectively. In wheat, CCC applied at ZGS 31-32 reduced grain yield by 480 kg ha-1. This yield reduction was associated with lower grain yield production by the main head and particularly lower single grain weight. In barley cv. Kymppi, ETH and TE treatments promoted yield formation, whereas in cv. Saana they tended to reduce yield. Early applied PGRs reduced stem height at 14 days after treatment irrespective of species or stem stature, but at maturity no constant PGR effect was noted. Excluding the stem length, PGRs did not modify plant stand structure or yield formation markedly.",

Red clover produced well in all swards during the two first seasons. In the third summer the proportion of red clover was greatly diminished except on sandy soil at the northernmost locality (64°40'N) where it remained productive. Linear regression adequately described the dependence of crude fibre content and crude protein content in dry matter of the primary growth and regrowth, both of red clover and grass, on accumulated temperature sum. The contents of P, K, Ca and Mg in clover and grass are given as a function of accumulated temperature to describe their changes during crop growth. The results give new knowledge about possibilities to grow red clover in the northern livestock region of Finland.

The intermediate additions of 100 and 500 µg Se per pot seemed to produce the highest biomasses, although this was nearly masked by large scatter in the data. The Se contents both in roots and shoots increased roughly proportionally to the amount of Se added. However, at small additions Se was preferentially allocated to roots, whereas at larger additions the contents in roots and shoots (mg kg-1 dry matter) were roughly equal. Se treatments did not change the morphology of hypocotyls. On the contrary, the specific length and area of basal and lateral roots were smallest at intermediate Se additions, whereas the specific volume was largest at the largest Se addition. These effects of Se on root morphology were, however, not unambiguously related to plant growth. As the Se contents in roots increased, the roots grew thicker and the specific volume of lateral roots increased in agreement with a hypothesis of increased endogenous ethylene production.;",

In the first experiment, repeated in three successive years (1983 —85) the components were the six-row varieties Agneta, Arra, Hja-673 and Porno. In the second experiment (1984), including two nitrogen doses (50 and 100 kgN/ha), both six-row (Agneta, Pomo) and two-row (Ida, Kustaa) varieties were used. Arra in the first and Agneta in the second experiment were the most competitive varieties. The results suggested that the fast growth of Arra at the beginning promoted its competitive ability. Increase in available nitrogen usually strengthened the competitiveness of Agneta. The observed competitive differences between varieties were not related to the earliness of a variety, neither to the morphological characters (two- and six-row varieties) nor to the grain yield of a variety grown alone. The competitive ability was not always a stable character, the dominant suppression relationship varying from one environment to another (e.g. growing season, nitrogen dose). The observed overyielding was not statistically significant. The ratio of actual to expected yield and the relative yield total of several mixtures exceeded slightly one. As a conclusion, the yield advantage of mixtures was marginal. As a rule, the mixtures were not more stable than monocultures as determined by the coefficient of variation. However, the yield of some mixtures varied less than the yield of the most stable monoculture.",

    "abstract": "Costs of purchasing new piglets and of feeding them until slaughter are the main variable expenditures in pig fattening. They both depend on slaughter intensity, the nature of feeding patterns and the technological constraints of pig fattening, such as genotype. Therefore, it is of interest to examine the effect of production technology and changes in input and output prices on feeding and slaughter decisions. This study examines the problem by using a dynamic programming model that links genetic characteristics of a pig to feeding decisions and the timing of slaughter and takes into account how these jointly affect the quality-adjusted value of a carcass. The state of nature and the genotype of a pig are known in the analysis. The results suggest that producer can benefit from improvements in the pigs genotype. Animals of improved genotype can reach optimal slaughter maturity quicker and produce leaner meat than animals of poor genotype. In order to fully utilise the benefits of animal breeding, the producer must adjust feeding and slaughter patterns on the basis of genotype. The results also suggest that the producer can benefit from flexible feeding technology. Typically, such a technology provides incentives to feed piglets with protein-rich feed. When the pig approaches slaughter maturity, the share of protein-rich feed in the diet gradually decreases and the amount of energy-rich feed increases. Generally, the optimal slaughter weight is within the weight range that pays the highest price per kilogram of pig meat. The optimal feeding pattern and the optimal timing of slaughter depend on price ratios. Particularly, an increase in the price of pig meat provides incentives to increase the growth rates up to the pigs biological maximum by increasing the amount of energy in the feed. Price changes and changes in slaughter premium can also have large income effects.;",

Thirty two Finnish Ayrshire dairy cows were used in a cyclic change-over experiment with four 21-day experimental periods and 4 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Silage fermentation was modified with formic acid (FA), which was applied at the rates equivalent to 0 (FA0), 2 (FA2), 4 (FA4) or 6 (FA6) litres t-1 grass of pure formic acid (as 100% FA). Dietary treatments consisted of four silages, a protein supplementation (no supplement or rapeseed meal 1.8 kg d-1) and a glucogenic substrate (no supplement or propylene glycol 225 g d-1). Increasing the application rate of FA restricted silage fermentation curvilinearly, as evidenced by higher concentrations of ammonia N and butyric acid in FA4 than FA2 silage. Similarly the use of FA resulted in curvilinear changes in the silage dry matter intake and milk yield. The highest milk and protein yields were achieved with FA6, while the milk yield with FA2 was higher than with FA4. Interactions were observed between silage type and supplementation. Rapeseed meal increased milk yield irrespective of the extent of silage fermentation, but the magnitude of response was variable. Propylene glycol was most beneficial with restrictively fermented silages FA4 and FA6. In conclusion, restriction of silage fermentation with a high rate of formic acid is beneficial in milk production. Interactions between silage composition and concentrate types suggest that the responses to supplementary feeding depend on silage fermentation characteristics.;",

Grain of oat cultivar Salo [from official variety trials, MTT Agrifood Research Finland, Jokioinen (60°49'N), 19962000] was assessed for quality prior to dehulling. Impact dehulling rotation speed ranged from 200 to 500 r min-1 at 50 r min-1 intervals, with moisture content of grains ranging from 10% up to 18%. Dehulling improved oat energy content markedly. Hullability was better at higher rotation speeds. 350 r min-1 was determined to be adequate to result in improved quality as no marked additional improvements were demonstrated by increasing rotation speed further. As the proportion of hulless groats increased with higher rotation speeds, nutritional and energy content of groat yield improved consistently. The higher the grain moisture, the higher the proportion of grains retaining hulls. Impact dehulling proved to be a potentially useful method to increase energy content of oat grains on-farm.;",

The possibility of applying the feed protein degradabilities to practical feeding conditions was also examined. In the experiments concerning reliability, such factors as bag porosity, sample weight, sample treatment, washing procedure, diets, and differences between animals and incubation days were studied. The feed protein degradabilities were also determined by using as incubation periods the ruminal retention times for particulate matter of different feeds, evaluated as a function of DM intake/100 kg liveweight in different diets. A nylon bag, with a pore size of 40 µm and internal dimensions of 6 X 12 cm was selected for the degradability determinations. The sample weight used in incubations was 57 —60 mg DM/cm2. In the determination of feed protein degradability, when sheep are used as experimental animals, it is recommended that for routine determinations only one animal be used, analyzing the contents of two bags for each incubation period during two successive days. A control sample of which degradability is determined in advance in many sheep, should be used in all incubations in order to control the digestive processes in the rumen of the experimental sheep. The actual degradabilities analyzed by the bag method are applicable in practise, if they are determined using animals at similar feeding levels and on diets similar to those prevailing under the conditions in which the degradabilities are going to be used.",

The silages were ensiled in pilot scale silos (3 m3) and the voluntary intake and digestibility in sheep were determined in two experiments designed as a 5 x 5 Latin square. The use of enzymes decreased the fibre content of silages, mainly the cellulose fraction, as compared with FA and untreated silages. Enzyme silages were well preserved with a low pH (3.93—4.15), moderate ammonia N (72—119 g/kg total N) and no butyric acid. As compared with untreated silages (mean pH 4.6, ammonia N 131) the preservation was improved. The FA silages were also well preserved (pH 4.0, ammonia N 57) with more restricted fermentation than enzyme silages. FA and especially higher levels of enzymes increased the amount of effluent. In Exp. I, the digestibilities of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and crude fibre were not significantly (P&gt;0.05) affected by the silage treatment. In Exp. II, the digestibility of DM and OM decreased linearly (P",

We studied surface and subsurface losses of P from a clayey underdrained field (Jokioinen/ Kotkanoja; Vertic Cambisol/Typic Cryaquept), with 2% mean slope, during two separate experimental periods. Primary tillage treatments of the first experimental period of three years were moldboard ploughing (to 2023 cm depth) vs. no autumn tillage (wintertime stubble). During the second experimental period of five years, the treatments were moldboard ploughing (2023 cm) vs. shallow (to 58 cm) autumn tillage. The stubble treatment of the first experimental period produced higher dissolved reactive P (DRP) losses (104259 g ha1 yr1) than autumn ploughing (7796 g ha1 yr1), and equally high particulate P (PP) losses (mean 660, 2351300 g ha1 yr1). During the second experimental period, shallow autumn tillage produced 28% higher DRP losses (mean 120, 107136 g ha1 yr1) than ploughing (83117 g ha1 yr1) and 11% higher PP losses (mean 1090, 6861336 g ha1 yr1) than ploughing (7831253 g ha1 yr1). Surface runoff made up 28% and 16% of the total flow from the ploughed soil during the first and the second experimental period, respectively, as compared to 50% for the stubble and 44% for the shallow autumn tillage. Routing of flow between surface and subsurface pathways had a major influence on the P losses. In the relatively flat landscapes of the main agricultural areas of southern Finland, the potential for decreasing agricultural P losses by reduced tillage appears limited.;",

    "abstract": "The incidence of udder diseases and the predisposing factors were examined in 32 herds, in a total of 500 cows. During a 3-year-period 0.32 cases of clinical mastitis occurred per cow per annum. Subclinical mastitis was detected in 61.2 % of the cows during one year. The average incidence based on a single sampling was 36.5 %. In order to obtain reliable information on the udder health of a herd the occurrence of both clinical and subclinical mastitis must be followed. Clinical cases, both those treated by a veterinarian on a farm visit and those treated by the owner according to phone prescription must be filed statistically. In this study the incidence of mastitis as reported by owner was only half of that actually detected. The incidence of teat injuries requiring veterinary treatment was 0.03 cases per cow per annum. The diagnosis »presence of bacteria» obtained from a milk sample examination using Nordic methods means according to this study in most cases the probable occurrence of infection and mastitis. Scoring of observations made from udder health, and indexes based on these scores prove to be good tools when studying relationships between udder diseases and predisposing factors. Of the somatic factors the age of the cow, stage of lactation, the distance of the rear teats from the stall floor and the position of the teats influence the incidence of mastitis. Therefore, these factors must be taken into consideration in preventive work, especially in the culling of cows. Neither teat shape nor milkability had any connection with the incidence of udder diseases. With regard to the factors in the production environment the incidence of clinical mastitis was influenced especially by the function of the milking machine. Diurnal changes in temperature, when exceeding5 degrees centigrade, increased the occurrence of mastitis. The use of a thermohygrograph is proposed in preventive work. Because of the small number of the herds only in few cases reliable proof could be obtained as to whether the constructional details of the cowshed or stall or the milking hygiene had any effect on udder health. The observations made, however, were not in disagreement with those findings published in other Nordic countries. The significance of the cattle tender as an environmental factor is great. When a mastitis control programme is worked out, therefore, the mastitis situation in a herd, and the predisposing factors detected on the farm must be reliably demonstrated to the owner and the measures required for improvement must be clearly proposed.",

    "abstract": "In addition to genetic progress made by selection on additive genetic values, short-term gains can be produced by recovering possible inbreeding depression or utilising putative overdominance. These are both caused mainly by dominance genetic variation which can be quantified using mixed model methodology. Inbreeding brings along a requirement for extra parameterisation in expressing and estimating dominance variance. The extra parameters specify how dominance is affecting the mean and (co)variances among inbred animals. The full description for breed crosses contains a very large set of parameters. The benefits from crossbreeding are highest with widely deviating allele frequencies between the breeds. Maximisation of heterosis can be done only on a temporary basis as a continued exploitation leads to stagnation in the overall genetic progress. Therefore efficient methods with immediate returns are needed to find the most promising breeds jointly with the most potential mating pairs. One possibility is the use of genomic tools in assessing populations for crossbreeding and in searching for major genes mediating dominance variation. The analyses are providing markers that can be used in choosing mating pairs that produce desirable dominance deviations in analysed marker brackets. Genome-wide marker sets can be used for discovering genome segments with maximum heterosis effect. The phenotypic records are available for such analyses, soon are also the large marker sets and their genotypes: the analytical tools need developers.;",

We have updated the list of current alien invertebrate pest species in Finland and produced a list of potential new alien pests using a self-organizing map (SOM) that ranks species in terms of their risk of entry into Finland. The 76 pest species recorded included 66 insects, 5 nematodes, 2 mites and 3 slugs. Nearly half of the alien species appeared to have invaded Finland during the last 48 years. The SOM analysis is considered a viable tool for identification of potentially high-risk invasive pests from among the multitude of potential alien invaders, and represents a useful complement to local expert knowledge-based risk assessment of potentially invasive pests. Along with the comparisons with databases of current and potential pest species, SOM analysis suggests that in the changing climate, the habitats at greatest risk from exotic pests in Finland are horticultural: orchards, ornamental hardy-nursery stocks, landscape and ornamental tree nurseries, and greenhouses.",

    "abstract": "The effects of reducing dietary nitrogen and increasing sodium chloride intake on renal function were studied in reindeer in order so elucidate the extent of urea conservation and solute excretion by the reindeer kidney. The fall in plasma urea concentration and urea excretion on the low protein diet was accompanied by a significant reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urine osmolality. The fraction of filtered urea reabsorbed increased. However, the contribution of the fall of the GFR to restriction of urinary losses of urea was far more significant than the increase in fractional urea reabsorption. The increase in sodium chloride intake reflected in icreased urinary sodium excretion, inducing a rise in urine osmolality on the low protein diet. Increased excretion of sodium was accompanied by decreased urea excretion. This interdependence of urea and sodium in urine excretion was particularly pronounced during the mating season in the autumn, when prominent retention of electrolytes and water was observed. On low protein diet, when reindeer were exposed to cold, the energy intake proved insufficient. The use of body protein as energy source resulted in increased plasma urea values. The fractional reabsorption of urea decreased, but the GFR stayed low. The GFR seems to be unaffected by plasma urea concentrations but is in some way regulated by the intake of dietary protein. Also on lichen diet the intake was not sufficient to satisfy the energy requirements and the plasma urea concentrations increased. The urea excretion was still low due to a decreased GFR. The high moisture content of lichen caused an increase in the urine water excretion, but no increase occured in the solute excretion. The rumen ammonia concentrations correlated significantly with the plasma urea concentrations, showing that urea is readily returned to the rumen in reindeer. The restriction of urea excretion on low protein intake contributes to the nitrogen economy and in reindeer it is brought about by a marked decrease in the GFR together with an increase in the urea reabsorption.",

An increase (0.3–46.7%) in the range size was projected for the 14 species and a decrease (1.2–67.4%) for the 11 species in a future climate. The inclusion of the land use data increased the explanatory power of the models. The greatest increases in range sizes were projected for Amaranthus retroflexus, Papaver hybridum and Fumaria parviflora, and declines for Sinapis arvensis, Cerastium semidecandrum and Chenopodium rubrum. Application of a more severe climate scenario (HadCM3A2) affected decline (0.5–18.5%) for 12 species and increase (2.2–31.5%) for 13 species in the range size projections compared with the less severe (HadCM3B2) scenario. Both model scenarios projected high percentage species loss in Mediterranean and temperate Europe, but high species gain in the Alps, Carpathians and in boreal Europe. The results suggest that even under moderate climate scenarios drastic changes in the weed establishment risk can be expected to take place in Europe in the future.",

A short-term laboratory experiment (4 weeks) was conducted with 24 vegetated (Phleum pratense) mesocosms (12 controls, 12 biochar-treated) that had spent a dormant season in the dark at 15°C for two months after the growing season. N2O efflux to the atmosphere and ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) in the percolated soil water were monitored before and after the FT event. N2O was monitored with the dark chamber method and analyzed using a gas chromatograph. We found that soil amended biochar can significantly diminish the burst of N2O after the soil FT event (by 61% just after FT event) and substantially reduce the risk of NO3-N and NH4+-N leaching from the agricultural soil. Compared to the control, the decrement in concentrations of NO3-N and NH4+-N in water percolated through the biochar amended soil in the mesocosms was 58% and 22%, respectively.",

A two-factorial field experiment in a randomized block design was carried out in 2010 and 2011, in north-eastern Poland. Experimental factor I was MBM dose (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 t ha-1 year-1), and experimental factor II was the year of the study (two consecutive years). Increasing MBM doses contributed to an increase in maize grain yield and 1000-grain weight. The yield-forming effect of MBM applied at 1.5 t ha-1 year-1 was comparable with that of nitrogen and phosphorus contained in mineral fertilizers. A dose of 2.5 t ha-1 MBM led to a significant increase in maize grain yield. The P and K content of maize grain was determined by MBM dose, whereas the concentrations of N, Mg and Ca in grain were not affected by MBM dose. Significantly higher N, P, K and Mg uptake by maize plants was observed in treatments with the highest MBM dose, compared with the control treatment. Nitrogen and phosphorus uptake per 1 t MBM reached 101 kg and 26 kg, respectively. The results of a two-year study show that the maximum MBM dose (2.5 t ha-1 year-1) met the fertilizer requirements of maize with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus.",

    "abstract": "Inorganic phosphorus in 363 samples of Finnish mineral soils was fractionated by the procedure of CHANG and JACKSON. The average content of total inorganic phosphorus determined as the difference of the total phosphorus and organic phosphorus tended to increase from sand to clay soils. The sand and fine sand soils appeared to be richer in fluoride-soluble phosphorus but poorer in acid-soluble phosphorus than the other groups of soils. The part of phosphorus extracted by alkali seemed to be almost independent on the soil texture. In about 60 per cent of the samples the acid-soluble phosphorus was the dominant inorganic phosphorus fraction, in spite of the often high acidity of the soil. This, in connection with the rather low content of reductant soluble phosphorus, was taken to indicate the relatively low degree of weathering in these soils. The higher contents of fluoride-soluble and alkali-soluble phosphorus in the surface samples of the cultivated soils as compared with the corresponding kind of virgin soils or soils from the deeper layers may be mainly attributed to the application of phosphorus fertilizers and to a somewhat higher degree of weathering. The soil pH did not seem to play any important role among the factors related to the distribution of inorganic phosphorus into various fractions in the present material. This was particularly true in the cultivated surface soils. It is likely, that in our soils the variation in the contents of active iron and aluminium will to a higher degree than pH explain the variation in the fractions of alkali-soluble and fuoride-soluble phosphorus. The relatively high content of the latter fraction in the sand and fine sand soils as compared with the soils of the finer texture could be related to the higher ratio of ammonium oxalate soluble aluminium to iron in the former soils.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the effects of silage plant species (faba bean and field pea based whole crop legume-cereals vs. grass) on performance and meat quality of growing Aberdeen Angus (AA) and Nordic Red (NR) bulls. A 2×3 factorial design was used. The experiment comprised 30 AA and 30 NR bulls. Both breeds were randomly allotted to the three feeding treatments. The compositions (g kg-1 dry matter) of diets were: 1) grass silage (650) plus rolled barley (350), 2) faba bean-wheat silage (650) plus rolled barley (350) and 3) pea-wheat silage (650) plus rolled barley (350). The experimental diets were offered as total mixed rations ad libitum. The AA bulls grew faster, had better feed conversion rates and superior dressing proportion and carcass conformation compared to the NR bulls. Replacing grass silage by whole crop legume-cereal silages in the diet did not have remarkable effects on animal performance, carcass characteristics or meat quality.",

Recently, F. proliferatum and its mycotoxin fumonisin were found in wheat grains. Here we report that seed-borne infection of wheat with F. proliferatum resulted in systemic colonization of wheat plants and contamination of wheat grains with fumonisins and beauvericin. F. proliferatum strains originating from different hosts were able to infect wheat via seeds. Colonization of wheat plants with the fungus was highest in the stems, followed by leaves; one third of the strains reached kernels, causing accumulation of fumonisins and beauvericin to 15–55 µg kg-1. The results show that seed-borne infection of wheat with F. proliferatum can lead to contamination of wheat kernels with mycotoxins fumonisins and beauvericin.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper the total and organic P content of virgin peat soils is studied on the basis of 217 peat samples mostly collected from Northern Finland and consisting of 32 Sp, 34 CSp, 62 SCp, 12 EuSCp, 36 BCp, and 41 Cp samples. The material was found to be satisfactorily typical for a study of Finnish peat soils as to the pH, ash and N contents. Only the BCp samples were, in some respect, of a poorer quality than in general. The total P content of the 217 samples ranged from 190 to 2350 ppm or from 30 to 2440 kg/ha. In the Sp and BCp groups the mean P content was equal, 580 ± 80 ppm and 560 ± 90 ppm resp., and significantly lower than the corresponding value in all the other groups which was 950 ±120 ppm in the Cp-group, 980 ± 290 in the EuSCp-group, 800 ± 60 in the SCp-group, and 800 ± 120 ppm in the CSp-group. A low but significant correlation was found to exist between the degree of land quality estimated on the basis of the surface vegetation and the P content of the surface samples: r = 0.361***. When the BCp samples were excluded an even closer correlation was detected: r = 0.481***. The correlation coefficient between the total P content and the degree of humification was r = 0.317***, that between the total P and the ash contents r = 0.289**, and that between the total P and N contents r = 0.206*. The organic P content of the 217 samples ranged from 130 to 1950 ppm with an average of 600 ± 40 ppm. The Sp and BCp groups showed significantly lower means, 430 ± 60 ppm and 440 ±7O ppm resp., than the other groups with averages of 630 ± 120 ppm in the CSp-group, 620 ± 50 ppm in the SCp-group, 770 ± 100 ppm in the Cp-group and 820 ± 280 in the EuSCp-group. The organic P content was very closely correlated with the total P content; the total correlation coefficient was r = 0.934***. The connection with the degree of humification was not distinct: the total correlation coefficient was r = 0.336***, but the partial correlation coefficient after the elimination of the effects of total P and N contents was only r = 0.136. No significant correlation existed between the organic P content and the N content, r = 0.184. The organic P content of the 217 samples expressed as a percentage of the total P content ranged from 55 to 95 per cent with an average of 78 ± 1 per cent. The proportion of organic P of total P was correlated with the degree of humification, the total correlation coefficient was r = 0.504***, the partial correlation coefficient after the elimination of the effect of the sampling depth was r = 0.427***. No correlation with the sampling depth existed after the elimination of the effect of the degree of humification: the partial correlation coefficient was r = 0.159, whereas the total correlation coefficient was r = 0.334***. A low correlation existed between the percentage of organic P of total P and the pH value even after the elimination of the effect of the degree of humification, r = 0.228*, but the connection with the total P content appeared to be only indirect and arised from the effect of the degree of humification, the total correlation coefficient was r = 0.222*, the partial correlation coefficient r = 0.076. The amount of organic P expressed as a percentage of the organic dry matter ranged from 0.01 to 0.25 per cent with an average of 0.07 ± 0.004. The ratio of N/org.P ranged from 12 to 133 with an average of 45 ± 3. Owing to the low P content of the BCp-group its mean ratio was significantly higher than that of the other groups. The degree of humification did not show any correlation with the ratio of N/org.P. The solubility of inorganic P in 0.5 N acetic acid and in 0.2 N sulphuric acid was highest in the Sp-group. On the average approximately from 15 to 30 per cent of total inorganic P was extracted by the latter solution. The acetic acid extracted only about 2 per cent of the inorganic P in the Cp-group but about 15 per cent in the Sp-group. The phosphorus conditions in virgin peat soils was discussed and it was attempted to explain the results obtained on the basis of the supposition that phosphorus is a minimum factor in the metabolism of peat.",

    "abstract": "An attempt has been made to elucidate the influence of lime and fertilizers upon the mineralization of peat nitrogen under laboratory conditions. The main object was to study differences between the responce of various kinds of peats to these treatments and to the incubation under conditions favourable for the activity of microorganisms. The material consisted of eight peat samples from North Finland. Four of them were fen peats with a virgin productivity of 6—8. The other four originated from untillable bogs with a virgin productivity of 1—3. All the samples were from virgin peat lands and only slightly decomposed. In spite of the different origins of these peat groups no marked differences in their chemical composition and characteristics could be found. This was supposed to be due to their low degree of decomposition. In the first large incubation experiment carried out at 15°—22 °C the accumulation of nitrate-nitrogen during the B—lo8—10 months of incubation was relatively high in all the limed samples, but marked nitrification occurred also in most of the un-limed samples, the Sphagnum fuscum peat being the most prominent exception. On the average, the effect of lime upon the total accumulation of mineral nitrogen was positive only in three of the fen peats and in the Sphagnum fuscum sample. In the second experiment lime seemed to stimulate the ammonification in the Sphagnum peats during the first month of incubation, but later on the accumulation of mineral nitrogen was found to be almost equally intensive in the limed and un-limed samples. No significant effect of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers could be stated in the incubation experiments. The same was true in respect to the effect of copper sulphate, zinc chloride or ammonium molybdate. The influence of ash upon the changes in the mineral nitrogen content of one fen peat was supposed to be due to its neutralizing agencies. The accumulation of mineral nitrogen, particularly of ammonium nitrogen, was highest in the untreated samples. Although some superiority of the fen peats to the Sphagnum peats in respect to the speed of the accumulation of mineral nitrogen could be stated, the differences between these groups after the prolonged incubation were negligible. This can be explained by the different intensity of immobilization and denitrification of nitrogen in these peats under the conditions of the experiments. It also may be taken to mean that no distinct differences existed between the decomposability of the nitrogen compounds of these slightly humified fen peats and Sphagnum peats.",

    "abstract": "Attention was paid in the present paper to the fact that the precision of the values obtained by different methods for the total organic phosphorus in soil cannot be very high. Even the variation caused by the treatment of the extracts and connected with the colorimetric estimation of phosphate in the solution makes it impossible to report the results more accurately than by 10—20 ppm organic P, at least if routine analyses are in question. Although the somewhat modified methods of Dean, Wrenshall and Dyer,. Pearson, and Mehta et al. yielded equal results for the organic phosphorus content of the respective mineral soils and of most of the peat soils analyzed, the treatment with cold alkali in the Wrenshall and Dyer procedure apparently failed to extract the organic phosphorus from two peat samples as quantitatively as the treatment with hot alkali in the other methods. On the basis of this observations a new modification of the method of Wrenshall and Dyer was proposed. It consists of an extraction of 1-g sample with 25 ml of 4 N sulphuric acid at room temperature for 18 hours, followed by washing with water and two successive extractions with 100 ml of 0.5 N sodium hydroxide, the first of them for 18 hours at room temperature, the second for 4 hours at 90°C. This method was found to extract from 40 peat soil samples on the average about 97 per cent of the total phosphorus dissolved by the Kjeldahl digestion and about 9 per cent more organic phosphorus than the method of Pearson. Experiments concerning the ignition and acid extraction procedures indicated that the method of Ghani was not suitable for the determination of organic phosphorus in the twelve samples analysed. The extraction with sulphuric acid showed no marked differences between the increase in the soluble phosphorus due to the ignition when the ratio of extraction was varied from 1:40 to 1:200, and the extractant from 0.2 N acid to 5 N acid. The results obtained for 40 peat samples by ignition for one hour at 600°C and extraction of the ignited and untreated samples with 0.2 N sulphuric acid in a ratio of 1:100 for half an hour were on the average 8 per cent higher than those given by the proposed acid-alkali extraction. The total organic phosphorus content of soil may probably be somewhat higher than the figure yielded by the acid-alkali extraction and slightly lower than the value obtained by the ignition method. For the present, the most reliable result seems to be found in the average of the data given by these two methods.",

    "abstract": "In the northern circumpolar zone, the area between the 600°Cd and 1200°Cd isopleths of effective temperature sum above 5°C, the annual receipt of solar energy is limited by the low angle of radiation arriving at the earth’s surface. This is the primary cause of the climatic constraints observed in the zone, such as low temperatures, a short growing season, frosts during the growing season, long and cold winters and thick snow cover. In Finland, the length of the growing season varies from 180 days in the south (60°N) to 120 days in the north (70°N). Consequently, the growing time for crops from sowing to ripening is also short, which limits their ability to produce high yields. The most advanced forms of farming in the high-latitude zone are encountered towards the south in Northern Europe, central Siberia and the prairies of Canada, i.e. mainly in the phytogeographical hemiboreal zone where the effective temperature sum is higher than 1200°Cd. Conditions for agriculture then deteriorate gradually further north with the cooling of the climate, and this is reflected as an increase in cattle rearing at the expense of grain cultivation. In northern Europe farming is practised as far north as to the Arctic Circle, at about 66°N latitude. In North America, fields extend to about 55°N, In Asia, there are few fields north of 60°N. Finland is the most northern agricultural country in the world, with all its field area, about 2.5 million hectares, located north of latitude 60°N. Changes in the climate and atmospheric CO2 predicted for the future are likely to have a strong influence, either beneficial or disadvantageous, on the conditions for growth in northern areas where the annual mean temperature is 5°C or less.",

Ten soil samples with varying clay content and P status were studied. Desorption tests were conducted by submitting the soils sequentially to nine anion exchange resin (AER) extractions. Sorption of P was studied by shaking the soils in P standard solutions (0-250 ppm). Soil inorganic P was characterised by sequentially extracting P from the fractions assumed to be connected to Al and Fe compounds and present as the stable apatitic form. The desorption studies and the fractioning of inorganic P suggested that oxalate solution dissolves apatitic P and/or other relatively stable P-bearing compounds, probably referring to the sum of inorganic P fractions rather than labile P. The amount of P desorbed in the nine AER extractions was about 80-280 mg/kg, whereas oxalate extracted about 490-1100 mg P/kg, which approximated the sum of the inorganic P fractions. Therefore, in soils high in apatitic P, oxalate-extractable P does not seem to be a reliable measure of the P saturation of Al and Fe oxide surfaces that regulate the P concentration in soil solution and runoff water.;",

The solution-to-soil ratio varied from 50 to 2000 1 kg-1. Sorption to and desorption from the soils were studied at different temperatures and ionic strengths by determining quantity-intensity (Q/I) plots at the solution-to-soil ratio of 50 l kg-1, and the results were fitted to a modified Langmuir equation: Q = QmaxI/(1/K + I)-Q0 where Q is P sorbed or desorbed, Qmax = maximum P sorption, I = P concentration in the equilibrium solution, K = sorption/desorption equilibrium constant, and Q0 = instantly labile P. The desorption of DRP was depressed by increases in the CaCl2 concentration of the extractant and promoted by widening of the solution-to-soil ratio. At the solution-to-soil ratio of 50 l kg-1, the increase in the temperature from 5 to 25°C raised the DRP release to water from 12.6 to 20.7 mg kg-1 in the Aurajoki soil and from 1.8 to 3.4 mg kg-1 in the Jokioinen soil. In the Aurajoki soil, the constant Q0 of the Langmuir equation responded to the changes of ionic strength and temperature in the same way as did DRP extracted at wide solution-to-soil ratios.

    "abstract": "Comprehensive research into phosphorus (P) in soils and crops began in Finland in the early 1900s. The average amount of total P in the ploughed topsoil layer of mineral soils was about two tonnes per hectare in the 1930s, before the abundant use of fertilisers. The main chemical fractions of P in mineral soils were organic matter, primary apatite and secondary complexes of the hydrous oxides of Al and Fe. Of the smaller amounts of P in light peat soils, as much as 80% was present in stable organic compounds. Field experiments showed that the native P reserves of Finnish soils are poorly available to plants, and that P fertilisers are inefficiently utilised because of the strong fixation of applied phosphate in soils. In evaluations before the late 1950s, all simple chemical tests appeared to be rather unreliable indicators of the supply of P from soils to plants, but later research has shown that the results were impaired by errors implicit in the research materials. Some soil test P values (STP)obtained from old samples stored for more than ten years evidently were too high, particularly for organic soils, and many of the soils studied were strongly acidic and therefore biologically less fertile than the chemical P tests indicated. The acid ammonium acetate method (pH 4.65) was introduced in the early 1950s and has since been used in routine soil testing in Finland, not only for P but for all macronutrients except N. In later evaluations of different methods used for estimating the requirement of P fertilisation, the acid ammonium acetate method has proven equal or superior to any other simple chemical method.;",

The samples were prepared by the standard method for examination by scanning electron microscope. The hyperparasitism of S. griseoviridis was clearly shown. S. griseoviridis tightly wound around Alternaria conidia and Sclerotinia hyphae, eventually disintegrating them. It grew along the hyphae of B. cinerea, P. sclerotioides and M. acerina, dissolving them. The hypha of F. oxysporum seemed to be slightly affected, and its conidia not at all. The hyperparasite grew only loosely on the hypha of R. solani and on the mycelium and oogonia of Pythium which seemed not to sustain much injury.",

Further, single application was compared to split applications. Carotene determinations were done at harvest in 1985 and 66, 88 and 121 (at harvest) days from sowing in 1986. The results were studied by contrast analysis. Weather conditions had a strong effect on the carotene content and in both years the carotene content increased with the length of the growing season. At harvest in 1985, PK placement with N fertirrigations had a tendency to yield a higher carotene content than did broadcast fertilization, irrigated single application, and NPK fertirrigations. The carotene content was higher when P and K were placement fertilized as compared to treatments where P and K were broadcast fertilized or fertirrigated (p = 0.1). At the first sampling date in 1986, fertilization increased the carotene content (p = 0.1). PK placement with N fertirrigations had a tendency to increase the carotene content as compared to placement fertilization, single application and irrigated single application. At the second sampling date and at harvest in 1986 no statistically significant differences could be found. The results indicate that the placement of PK-fertilizer or NPK-fertilizer was favourable to carotene production.

These scenarios are the results of a large Delphi study carried out among Finnish agri-food sector stakeholders. The Delphi panel members gave their future view on desirable and probable futures. From these two dimensions, three scenarios were elaborated through the future images  the subjective future path and the importance analysis. The scenarios represent a technology optimistic day-dream agriculture, a probable future as industrialised agriculture and an undesirable future path as drifting agriculture. Two mini-scenarios are also presented. They are based on a discontinuity event as an unexpected impact of climate change and an analogy event as an ecological breakdown due to the expansive animal disease epidemics. In both mini-scenarios, the directions of storylines are dramatically changed. The scenarios support strategic planning introducing not only one forecast but alternative outcomes as a basis for future strategy and decisions. In this study the scenarios were constructed to address the opportunities as a desired vision and also the threats as to an undesirable future in the agricultural sector. These results bring to the table a Finnish agri-food expert community view of the future directions of relevant key issues in the agricultural policy agenda.;",

We also present the first attempt to estimate the success of recent conservation efforts for wooded meadows. Our analysis is based on recent exhaustive inventories. We found that Estonia, despite a decrease of the area in wooded meadows by two orders of magnitude during the 20th century, still has about 8400 ha remaining of which approximately 5800 ha are meadows with, at the least, an intermediate conservation value. The latter is directly dependent on mowing regime. Efforts to preserve wooded meadows include establishment of protected areas and financial support for mowing. The national conservation subsidy has been useful and supportive for wooded meadows, however the total amount of this subsidy has been small compared to the area that could be supported. The much larger funds of agri-environmental subsidies have largely not been available for wooded meadows. Moreover, there has been no record keeping about subsidisation of semi-natural grasslands using agricultural support schemes. Although the preservation of some good examples of wooded meadows in Estonia seems guaranteed, further degradation of this valuable habitat type on a national scale is very probable.;",

In Experiment 2, compost extract, Trichoderma spp. and Gliocladium catenulatum sprays were studied in Ruukki. The treatment time was chosen to control grey mould. The effect of different biological sprays on the incidence of grey mould and total and marketable yield was insignificant compared to the untreated control. In both years and in all trials the incidence of grey mould was low and rot occurred mainly in the latter part of the harvesting period, which may partly explain the small differences between treatments.

Options for mechanical and cultural control of S. arvensis were studied in a field experiment on clay soil under organic production. The experiment consisted of different crop sequences: spring cereal (barley, Hordeum vulgare L., in 2001, oats, Avena sativa L., in 2002) with or without inter-row hoeing and/or stubble cultivation, bare fallow, fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), and ley with mowing. In 2003 the entire field was sown to spring wheat. Crop plant and Sonchus shoot density and dry mass prior to cereal harvest and crop yield were assessed. The control effect was rated: bare fallow &gt; ley &gt; cereal with or without inter-row hoeing &gt; poor growth fibre hemp. Bare fallow was an effective but costly way to reduce S. arvensis infestation. Introduction of a regularly mown green fallow or silage ley in the crop rotation is advisable. Mechanical weed control by inter-row hoeing in cereals limits S. arvensis growth. Infestation might also be reduced by stubble cultivation in autumn. When managing S. arvensis using mechanical and cultural methods, appropriate options, including a competitive crop, should be chosen for the specific field and rotation.;",

A pedon in a field that has been in agricultural use since the 17th century was characterized and features indicative of human-influenced pedogenic processes were identified. Owing to intensified agriculture, the soil has become drier than ever before. Natural shrink-swell and anthropogenic turbation processes had destroyed the rock structure to a depth of 72 cm. Groundwater monitoring during nine years proved that in several years the soil had a chance to desiccate down to 150 cm, resulting in wedge-shaped prisms and desiccation joint planes. The cracks and root channels serve as routes for clay translocation. Illuvial clay, observed in thin sections, had the maxima (&gt;1%) in the Btg (3872 cm) and BCtg2 (112140 cm) horizons, corresponding to the effective drainage depths during ditch drainage until 70 years ago and subsequent subsurface tile drainage, respectively. Seventy years of improved drainage seems to be sufficient to give rise to an argic/argillic horizon. This feature is likely manmade but, being irreversible, it must be taken into account in soil classification. In this climate, agriculture seems to influence pedogenesis strongly throughout the solum far below the plough layer. Luvisols (WRB) or Cryaqualfs (Soil Taxonomy) have not been documented in a clay soil in Finland or Sweden before.;",

The amount of the above-ground biomass stays about the same at least for three years after 23 years of increase, whereas the underground biomass increases strongly at least during the first six years, if succession starts after open cultivation. The general tendency in succession at the species level is for the typical weed species of open cultivations to reduce in a few years, and for the species of meadow vegetation to increase both in frequency and abundance. Five vegetation types were distinguished: I) Galeopsis-type, 2) Phleum-type, 3) Anthoxanthum-type, 4) Deschampsia-type, and 5) Elytrigia-type.

The feeding experiment with 24 Finnish Ayrshire and 8 Holstein-Friesian bulls included 4 forage feeding treatments: (1) grass silage (G), (2) whole-crop barley and hairy vetch mixture silage (BHV), (3) whole-crop wheat and hairy vetch mixture silage (WHV) and (4) whole-crop barley silage (B). In all treatments animals were offered silage ad libitum. The amount of concentrate supplementation was 36 g (W0.75)-1 animal-1 day-1 for all treatments. The concentrate ration included rolled barley and rapeseed meal. Differences between the treatments were compared using an a priori test (Dunnetts test) so that comparison of the diets was based on the G diet. The animals were fed the experimental diets from day 240 to finish at day 505 of age. During the experiment the average concentrate proportions of G, BHV, WHV and B diets were 437, 424, 426 and 423 g dry matter (DM) (kg DM)-1, respectively. There were no significant differences in silage DM intake or in the total DM intake (DMI) (kg DM d-1) between treatments. However, DMI kg-1 W0.75 tended to be 3.5% higher (p = 0.09) in the B diet than in the G diet. Due to increasing energy intake, the gain of the bulls was higher with the G diet than with the WHV diet (p &lt; 0.05). BHV and B diets did not differ from the G diet in gain. Treatments had no significant effect on the dressing proportion or carcass conformation. The carcass fat score of WHV bulls was 29% lower (p &lt; 0.05) than that of the G bulls, but BHV and B diets did not differ from the G diet in carcass fatness. The feed conversion rate (DM intake kg-1 carcass gain) of the bulls was better (p &lt; 0.001) and protein conversion (g AAT kg-1 carcass gain) tended to be better (p = 0.07) with the G diet than with the WHV diet. BHV and B diets did not differ from the G diet in any feed conversion parameters. It can be concluded that replacing moderate digestible grass silage with whole-crop wheat and hairy vetch mixture silage decreased the carcass gain of growing dairy bulls due to lower energy intake and poorer feed conversion. Instead, replacing moderate digestible grass silage with whole-crop barley or with whole-crop barley and hairy vetch mixture silage resulted in no differences in the performance or carcass characteristics parameters of growing dairy bulls.;",

Thirty-one bulls with an initial live weight (LW) of 289 kg were selected for a 2 ~ 2 factorial design experiment consisting of two primary growth GCSs harvested at different maturities (in vitro digestible organic matter (OM) in dry matter (DM), D value: Early-cut, E, 750 g kg-1 DM; Late-cut, L, 699 g kg-1 DM) and two concentrate crude protein concentrations (Medium, M, 170 g kg-1 DM; High, H, 210 g kg-1 DM). The concentrate comprised milled barley and pelleted commercial protein compound and was offered daily on average 3.2 kg DM, including 0.45 and 1.13 kg of rapeseed cake in M and H, respectively. Grass-red clover silage was offered ad libitum. The target cold carcass weight was 330 kg.The proportion of concentrate of the total daily DM intake averaged 0.337 during the entire experiment. Treatments had no effect on the daily intake of GCS, total intake of DM, DM intake kg-1 LW0.75 and metabolizable energy averaging 6.0 and 9.4 kg DM, 97.4 g and 109.4 MJ, respectively. The digestibility of dietary OM and neutral detergent fibre was lower (p &lt; 0.05, 0.733 vs. 0.769 and 0.625 vs. 0.665) on diet L than on diet E. The animals on diet E tended to consume daily on average 1.29 kg less (p &lt; 0.10) DM kg-1 net weight gain than those on diet L. The time to achieve the target carcass weight was on average 18 days longer (p &lt; 0.01) on diet L than on diet E. During the entire experiment the LW gain averaged 1795 and 1609 g d-1 (p &lt; 0.01) on diets E and L, respectively. The concentrate protein concentration did not affect animal performance. Treatments had no significant effect on the kill-out proportion, EUROP carcass conformation and carcass fat classification which averaged 537 g kg-1, 6.5 and 3.6, respectively. The eating quality of the tested loins was good. Treatments had only a minor effect on the yield of valuable cuts. It is concluded that the digestibility of silage is important since the early-cut silage improved the growth rate and shortened the finishing period of bulls significantly compared with those fed late-cut silage. The lower yield and, thus, higher unit cost of early.cut silage may, however, invalidate its superiority compared with the late.cut silage. There was no benefit from using concentrate of high protein concentration.;",

In order to study the effect of C. arvenses root system on soil properties, the field experiment and a survey of arable fields were conducted in Estonia. The soil bulk density and penetration resistance were measured from soils covered by C. arvense or spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) on compacted and un-compacted soil. The results showed significantly lower penetration resistance and bulk density underneath C. arvense than under barley in both the field experiment and a field survey on arable soils. The shoot mass of C. arvense was less affected than the shoot mass of barley by soil compaction and was caused by C. arvenses better ability to develop its root system in compacted soil. Wheat yield, on soils affected by C. arvense, was increased by 28% on loose soil and 37% on compacted soil. It may be concluded that in areas affected by deep-rooted weed species, such C. arvense, the soils physical properties will improve at least in the first two years.;",

In this study these specific topics were investigated i.e. resource allocation and also the financial success of diversified farms from a farm management perspective. The key question addressed in this dissertation, is how tangible and intangible resources of the diversified farm affect the financial success. This studys theoretical ackground deals with resource-based theory, and also certain themes of the theory of learning organisation and other decision-making theories. Two datasets were utilised in this study. First, data were collected by postal survey in 2001 (n = 663). Second, data were collected in a follow-up survey in 2006 (n = 439). Data were analysed using multivariate data analyses and path analyses. The study results reveal that, diversified farms performed differently. Success and resources were linked. Professional and management skills affected other resources, and hence directly or indirectly influenced success per se. In the light of empirical analyses of this study, tangible and intangible resources owned by the diversified farm impacted on its financial success. The findings of this study underline the importance of skills and networks for entrepreneur(s). Practically speaking all respondents of this study used either agricultural resources for non-farm businesses or non-farm resources for agricultural enterprises. To share resources in this way was seen as a pragmatic opportunity recognised by farmers. One of the downsides of diversification might be the phenomenon of over-diversification, which can be defined as the situation in which a farm diversifies beyond its optimal limit. The empirical findings of this study reveal that capital and labour resource constrains did have adverse effects on financial success. The evidence indicates that farms that were capital and labour resource constrained in 2001 were still less profitable than their no problems counterparts five years later.;",

The dung and urine patches were applied in June or August two consecutive grazing seasons and the measurements were carried out for a year following each application. There were no significant differences in CH4 fluxes between plant species and emissions originated mainly from the fresh dung pats. The average annual CH4 fluxes from the control sites without excreta were -0.60±0.1 and with the excreta 0.47±0.3 kg CH4 ha-1. Thus, excreta originating from dairy cows can turn boreal swards from weak sinks to small sources of CH4. However, these emissions are only 0.2% of the total CH4 emissions from a dairy cow.",

The studied mulching systems were: plastic mulch (PM), mulch with row cover (PMRC), and matted-row system (MRS). Results showed that plastic mulch with row cover (PMRC) generally increased yield per plant, average fruit weight, SSC, firmness and ORAC, but differences varied within harvest times. No significant differences in total yield and TA were observed under the selected mulching systems. Both PMRC and PM accelerated the harvest periods compared to MRS. ‘Kent’ and ‘Jewel’ had the highest total yield while ‘SJ8976-1’ and ‘St-Pierre’ had the highest average fruit weight. The highest SSC, TA and ORAC were found in ‘Jewel’. There was no interaction between the mulching systems and genotypes, indicating that the effect of production system is independent of cultivars. PMRC seems to be a better growing system, improving fruit quality and increasing the nutritional value of all genotypes. By allowing off-season fruit production in cool climates, PMRC can be an alternative method to the costly high tunnels.",

Climatic and biotic constraints may challenge future crop production. The objective of this study was to speculate how a range of arable land use patterns, resulting from various policy driven choices, could be introduced into a farming system, and how they would affect the risks associated with nutrient leaching. We found that while adaptation to climate change must include consideration of crop choices, there are conflicts associated with allocations and rotations for various market and policy situations. The expected increase in nutrient loading in the simulations caused by climate change was moderate. The increase can partly be compensated for by changes in farmland use, more in the shorter term than in the longer term to mid-century. In the future, adaptation at cropping system level is potentially an efficient way to manage nutrient load risks.",

The average annual yields and protein yield achieved in crop rotation were studied. The field trials were carried out in north-eastern Poland in 2006–2010. The factor was dose of MBM: 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 t ha-1 year-1 or 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 t ha-1 every other year. The four-year experiment has proven that MBM is a valuable nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer in cultivation of cereals and oilseed rape. By amendment of the tested meal into the soil it produced crop yield and protein yield similar to that achieved by mineral fertilization. However, the crude fat yield of rape was significantly higher under the influence of all the MBM doses. The yield-stimulating effect of MBM did not depend on the frequency of its application; therefore it is more convenient to apply it once every two years. Increasing MBM from 1.5 to 2.5 t ha-1 did not significantly increase any of the four crop yields, therefore for soils that had satisfactory nutrients content, 1 or 1.5 t ha-1 MBM is enough and increasing MBM will only increase economic burden for farmers and environmental risks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper some observations on the estimation of organic phosphorus in mineral soils are reported. The fact is emphasized that the accuracy of all the methods available is relatively poor. Usually, there are no reasons to pay attention to differences less than about 20 ppm. of organic P. Analyses performed on 345 samples of Finnish mineral soils by the extraction method of MEHTA et. al. (10) and by a simple procedure adopted by the author (successive extractions with 4 N H2SO4 and 0.5 N NaOH at room temperature in the ratio of 1 to 100) gave, on the average, equal results. It seemed to be likely that the MEHTA method removed the organic phosphorus more completely than did the less vigorous method, but in the former the partial hydrolysis of organic phosphorus compounds tends to be higher than in the latter. An attempt was made to find out whether the differences between the respective values for organic phosphorus obtained by an ignition method and the simple extraction method could be connected with any characteristics of the soil. No correlation or only a low correlation coefficient could be calculated between the difference in the results of these two methods and e. g. the pH-value, the content of clay, organic carbon, aluminium and iron soluble in Tamm’s acid oxalate, the indicator of the phosphate sorption capacity, or the »Fe-bound» inorganic phosphorus, respectively. The absolute difference tended to increase with an increase in the content of organic phosphorus. For the 250 samples of surface soils analyzed, the ignition method gave values which were, on the average, about 50 ppm. higher than the results obtained by the extraction procedure. The corresponding difference for the 120 samples from deeper layers was about 20 ppm of organic P. The author recommends, for the present, the determination of the total soil organic phosphorus as an average of the results obtained by the ignition method and the extraction method.",

Reducing the CAP budget by 20% would affect farm incomes by 20–25% in southern Finland while central and northern parts of the country, which are dependent on national payments coupled to dairy and beef production, would be less affected. Our results show that the milk and beef sectors throughout the country are still dependent on support payments coupled to production due to reduced real prices for agricultural products.

An economic agricultural sector model was used in order to assess the impacts of the scenarios on production, land use and farm income in Finland. The results suggest that falling crop yields, if realized due to low prices and restrictive policies, will result in decreasing crop and livestock production and increasing nutrient surplus. Slowly increasing crop yields could stabilise production and increase farm income. Significantly higher crop prices and yields are required, however, for any marked increase in production in Finland. Cereals production would increase relatively more than livestock production, if there were high prices for agricultural products. This is explained by abundant land resources, a high opportunity cost of labour and policies maintaining current dairy and beef production.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity degradation is a national and global problem which is interconnected with land use and climate change. All these are major unsolved questions and their interactions are only partly understood. Agriculture and especially cattle farming is under keen societal focus because of its significant role in soil carbon losses, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and biodiversity preservation. We reviewed the Finnish scientific literature to assess the impact of intensive contra extensive grass production on biodiversity using vascular plants, vertebrates, invertebrates and soil biota. Still a few decades ago, mixed farming was prevailing almost everywhere in Finland, but nowadays cereal production is essentially clustered in the southwest and milk and beef production in the northeast. This is reflected in the distribution of intensive (connected with cattle) and extensive grasslands (both types of farming). The bird community was most abundant and species rich in farmland which provides small fields in large blocks of farmland and many kinds of crops, including both intensive and extensive grasslands. Overall permanent grasslands with rather simply vegetation diversity can maintain a diverse community of spiders and leafhoppers, and act as overwintering habitat for polyphagous predators in field ecosystems. The ecological requirement of all species and species groups are probably never met at one site and consequently target should be in having differently managed areas at regional scale. For some of the taxa, ecosystem services could be indicated, but a research-based quantitative assessment is available only for carbon sequestration and weak impact of dung-beetles in diminishing GHG emissions from cow pats. Our review demonstrated that quite much is known about biodiversity in extensively managed grasslands, but very little in intensively managed grasslands. An important question is whether there is some threshold for the proportion of grasslands under which regional biodiversity will be reduced. Intensive production offers limited value to replace the high biodiversity value of semi-natural pastures.",

Wheat was grown for three seasons in two locations across Lithuania and sowing was carried out one time per week from 1 September to 29 September. Average three-year temperature of vegetation period gets lower every week by 0.16 °C, and available GDD by 94.5 °C when sowing time is delayed. Modeling results showed that tillering rate is affected by sowing time winter wheat grew 232 (tillers m-2) less with each week of delayed sowing. Grain filling stage was shortened by 1.25 days with each delayed sowing week. Depending on sowing time yield varied from 8.58 t ha-1 to 6 t ha-1 while simulated harvest was 8% lower. We conclude that best winter wheat sowing time for current climatic conditions in Lithuania is mid-September and DSSAT model proves as a useful tool in anticipating sowing time while facing problems caused by a climate change.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper it is tried to trace the fate of fertilizer phosphorus in soil by comparing the analyses of soils from treated and untreated plots of field trials. This indirect approach cannot be expected to provide exact values, but it is likely to give an approximate answer. The results reported above do not in any marked degree change our present conception of the forms in which fertilizer phosphorus accumulates in soils. In the acid soils studied (pH 4—6.4 in 0.02 N CaCl2) superphosphate tended to increase the fractions which were extracted by NH4F or NaOH. Hyperphosphate phosphorus was mostly found in the acid-soluble fraction. During a longer period of dressing with phosphate an increase in the organic phosphorus content of a peat soil could be detected. In the incubation experiments the mineralization of organic phosphorus occurred at a higher rate in the samples from the plots treated with superphosphate than in those from the untreated one. It might be supposed that the organic phosphorus mineralized mainly originated from the plant residues. It seems that the fractionation method developed by CHANG and JACKSON (4) for the estimation of discrete forms of soil phosphorus is not quite satisfactory for tracing the fertilizer phosphorus in soils recently dressed with phosphates. In particular, it may be fallacious to conclude that the fraction extracted by NH4F would only represent phosphorus bound to aluminium and its compounds. At least in the absence of soil, a large part of phosphorus in dicalcium phosphate dihydrate falls into this fraction, and also a small amount of hyperphosphate phosphorus may be found in it. The test values for »available» phosphorus showed the effect of fertilizers in accordance with previous observations (9, 13). Acetic acid soluble P revealed the treatment with hyperphosphate, but only slightly the application of superphosphate. The test value for the sorbed P of BRAY and KURTZ (2), or phosphorus extracted by 0.03 N NH4F-0.025 N HCI, distinctly indicated the addition of superphosphate, and also to some extent the presence of hyperphosphate phosphorus. Thus, even these results furnish a supplement to the data (11, 19) which prove that acids are not recommendable for the estimation of »available» phosphorus in Finnish soils. Probably, the use of ammonium fluoride would give a more reliable picture, provided, it is on the whole possible to characterize the phosphorus condition of soil with this kind of test values.",

Also the quantities of extracted sodium are reported. It has been found that the percentic content of these cations in the surface vegetation are higher than in the peat. Particularly marked is the accumulation of potassium in living plants and, although in a less degree, in the surface layers of peat. The variation in the distribution of the extractable amounts of the cations in various depths of the peat lands is considerable. A significant correlation exists between the depth and the magnesium content, and a negative correlation between the depth and the amount of extractable potassium. So far as the amount of cations extracted by 1 N ammonium chloride represents nutrients available for plants, calcium and magnesium are not generally minimum factors in peat soils, whereas in most soils the sources of potassium probably will be depleted by the first crops.",

The composition of weed flora in spring cereal fields was investigated in southern and central Finland during 2020–2022. The survey was conducted in 16 regions, 226 farms and 549 fields. The occurrence of weeds was assessed in the second half of July from 90 organically cropped and 459 conventionally cropped fields. The weed flora was dominated by broad-leaved species, representing 81% of the total number of 138 identified species. The average species number per field was 21 in organic fields and 12 in conventional fields. The most frequent weed species in organic fields were Chenopodium album 99%, Erysimum cheiranthoides 84%, Viola arvensis 83% and Stellaria media 82%. In conventionally cropped fields, the most frequent species were Viola arvensis 83%, Stellaria media 65%, Galeopsis spp. 59% and Galium spurium 59%. The two most common grass species in both production systems were Poa annua and Elymus repens. The frequency and density of Poa annua had increased substantially in conventional cropping since the previous survey in 2007–2009. The average density of weeds was 384 plants m-2 in organic fields and 147 plants m-2 in sprayed conventional fields. The average air-dry biomass of weeds was 678 kg ha-1 and 151 kg ha-1, respectively. Elymus repens produced almost a quarter of the total weed biomass in both production systems. Changes in weed flora were minor in terms of frequency and density of the most common broad-leaved weed species. Increased infestation of Poa annua in conventional cropping calls for special attention. The dominance of Elymus repens decreased in both production systems since the previous survey.",

    "abstract": "Adequate nitrogen (N) nutrition is essential for producing high vegetable yields of good quality. Fertilizer N not taken up by the plants is, however, economically wasteful and can be lost to the environment. Therefore the efficient use of N fertilizer, involving accurate estimation of crop N demand, choice of application method and timing of N fertilization, is an important research area. The effects of band placement and rate of N fertilization on inorganic N in the soil and the dry matter accumulation, yield and N uptake of cabbage, carrot and onion were studied in a three-year field experiment between 1993 and 1995. The plants were sampled during the growing season to determine the dry matter accumulation and plant N concentration. The inorganic N in the soil was determined during the growing period and after harvest. The N uptake was 3.8 kg, 1.6 kg and 2.5 kg per ton of edible yield of cabbage, carrot and onion, respectively. At the highest yield levels the N uptake including crop residues was 300 kg ha-1, 150 kg ha-1 and 120 kg ha-1 in cabbage, carrot and onion, respectively. In cabbage, almost 50% of N was in crop residues, whereas in carrot and onion only about 30% of N was in crop residues. Nitrogen uptake from non-fertilized soil varied from 29 to 160 kg ha-1, depending on the growing season and the crop. Cabbage and carrot utilised soil N efficiently, usually taking up more than 100 kg ha-1 from non-fertilized soil. Onion, on the contrary, utilised soil N relatively poorly, usually less than 50 kg ha-1 from non-fertilized soil. The rate of N uptake was low with all crops in early summer. After one month, N uptake increased in cabbage and onion. This uptake continued until harvest, i.e. mid-August for onion and early September for cabbage. Nitrogen uptake by carrot started rapidly only two months after sowing and continued until harvest at the end of September. High N rates often resulted in high N concentrations and N uptakes, but growth was not necessarily increased. One month after fertilization, most of the N placed was still near the original fertilizer band and at the depth of 5-10 cm. At that time, broadcast N was at a depth of 0-5 cm. After harvest the soil mineral N content was generally low, i.e. below 25 kg ha-1 at the depth of 0-60 cm. Onion was an exception with poor growth in 1994, when soil mineral N after the highest N rate was 80 kg ha-1 at a depth of 0-60 cm after harvest. The placement distance in the cabbage experiment, 7.5 cm in the side and 7 cm below cabbage transplants, resulted in lower plant growth and N uptake than broadcasting of N at the beginning of the growing periods 1993 and 1994. Towards harvest differences between application methods decreased, although in 1993, placement of N still led to 6% lower cabbage yields than broadcasting of N. In 1993, high N rates increased cabbage dry weight and N uptake towards harvest, and this effect was more pronounced when N was broadcast. In 1994, soil N mineralisation was high, and only non-fertilized cabbages took up less N than fertilized plants. Carrot was remarkably insensitive to N fertilization. Carrot yields were similar with and without N fertilizers. Band placement and N rate did not affect carrot growth and N uptake. In 1993, band placement and high rates of N increased onion growth and bulb yield more than broadcasting. In 1994, onion growth was poor and treatments did not affect plant N concentrations or growth. Apparent recovery of fertilizer N was increased in 1993 by low N rates or band placement. This result that band placement of N does not much affect vegetable growth is in agreement with most previous studies. With onion, probably due to the sparse root system, positive effects of N placement are most likely to be found.;",

Spring tillage reduced N leaching only on peat soil (16%). Slight competition between the main and the undersown crop was indicated by lower N contents of the barley yield.;",

We measured the current plant species richness and composition of the boundaries, and based on the differences in vegetation characteristics, we describe six boundary types. The observed plant species were mainly indicators of fresh to wet soils and moderate to rich mineral nitrogen content. The most frequent species were tall, perennial monocots and dicots indicating the high productivity of thevegetation. Moreove, herbicide-tolerant species were common. No species rare for Finland were found.In animal husbandry regions, the most frequent species were sown grassland species and typical grassland weeds. In cereal production regions, fast-spreading root weeds tolerant of herbicides were the most frequent. Mean species richness was highest in the cluster Ca-lamagrostis-Phalaris (24 species (s)/boundary (b)), which we considered as representative of moist sites with some disturbance by agricultural practices. Most species-poor were the clusters Elymus-Anthriscus (14 s/b)and Elymus-Cirsium (16 s/b),both found predominantly in cereal production regions in southern Finland. Our results suggest that the biodiversity value of boundaries is lowest in the most intensive cereal production areas and highest in areas of mixed farming.;",

Further reduction of sodium content in low-salt meat products is possible by replacing sodium phosphate with potassium phosphate.

The amounts of P required to attain and maintain an adequate P status in the soil were investigated in field experiments at 22 sites in Finland on soils containing large amounts of residual fertiliser P. The effects of five rates (0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 kg ha-1) of annual P application were measured in the soil by chemical methods after 9 to 15 experimental years, and the changes in soil test P values (STP) were compared with P balances.

The mean changes of STP in the whole topsoil caused by P fertilisation expressed as per cent of the balance difference were 3.5% (0.0159 mg dm-3)/(kg ha-1) in the acid ammonium acetate test (PAc), 4.7% (0.0214 mg dm-3)/(kg ha-1) in water extraction (Pw) and 9.7% (0.058 mg kg-1)/(kg ha-1) in sodium bicarbonate extraction (modified Olsen P). Initially high PAc values tended to slowly decrease at zero P balance, while low values did not change without some particular reason, such as soil acidification or mixing of the topsoil with some of the less fertile subsurface soil.

This study seeks to explain this difference by measuring carbon (C) and N profiles in both an AS soil and a neighbouring non AS soil. In Lapua, western Finland, two adjacent fields (Dystric Cambisols), subjected to similar agricultural practices, were analysed to the depth of 240 cm for pH, total C (Ctot), total N (Ntot), NH4 +-N, NO3 --N, sulphur and bulk density. Field A, an AS soil, contained sulfidic materials and 0.9% Ctot below 170 cm, while Field B, not an AS soil, had 0.3% Ctot in the subsoil and no sulfides. In these soils, the groundwater level declined below 200 cm in summer, subjecting the subsoil to oxidation. This study revealed large stocks of Ctot, Ntot, and mineral N in the subsoil, particularly in the AS soil. At 20240 cm, Field A contained 292 tons of Ctot ha-1 and 25 tons of Ntot ha-1, while Field B had 152 tons of Ctot ha-1 and 11 tons of Ntot ha-1. Field A contained up to 435 kg of mineral N ha-1 in autumn, while in Field B there was only up to 137 kg of mineral N ha-1. In Field A, NH4 +-N dominated strongly, while NO3 --N dominated in Field B. It is suggested that the greater concentration of mineral N in the AS soil is due to 1) a greater stock of total (mineralizable) N and 2) the slower rate of nitrification resulting in substantial NH4 +-N retention on cation exchange sites.;",

The following seven viruses were found to occur; potato viruses X, S, M, Y, A, potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) and tobacco rattle virus (TRV). The isolates of potato viruses X and Y included two clearly distinct strains. The other viruses had only minor variants. The most severe and important of the viruses was PVY, particularly its Y° strain. Other important viruses were PVM and PVA and potentially PLRV. PVY was found to be the most easily transmitted in the field. For serological identification of the viruses, indigenous antisera produced for selected isolates were mostly used. Significant serological variation was only found among the PVY isolates. The lowest concentration of PVX D-protein detected with the agar gel double diffusion test was 10 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml with the single diffusion test. With the ELISA test 0.1 ng of virus /ml could be detected. For PVX the lowest relative value detected in potato leaf sap was a dilution of between 10-6 and 10-7. The chloroplast agglutination test was too unreliable for detecting PVY in potato samples. Also the agar gel double diffusion test was found to be too insensitive for the identification of potato viruses but the single diffusion test could be used in certain cases. With the ELISA test potato viruses X, S, M and Y could be reliably detected in potato leaf sap and with almost the same accuracy in sap from sprouting tubers. The ELISA test was also found to give satisfactory results during routine testing for the identification of PVA and PLRV in potato leaves or non-dormant tubers.",

In 1982 a large number of intoxicated animals were suspected of being affected by mycotoxicosis. Later on imported maize was found to be the cause of the illness. After 2 years of investigations we concentrated our attention on Fusarium toxins, and in the autumn of 1984 we were able to detect the presence of trichothecenes in feeds. The rainy summer of 1984 created very favourable conditions for the growth of moulds. The production lines of some feed factories were contaminated by Fusarium fungi. The number of intoxicated animals increased drastically. Two strains of Fusaria were isolated at a feed factory. Since the trichothecenes have strong dermotoxic and cytotoxic effects, biological tests were used in this investigation. Capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to identify and quantify the trichothecenes. Qualitative and quantitative results are presented together with the symptoms observed in the intoxicated animals. The reliability and the significance of the results have been discussed. Despite what has earlier been believed, itis evident from our results that trichothecenes are unstable in cereals and feeds. In fact, samples which originally proved to be toxic were found to be almost toxin-free after 3 to 6 months storage at +4°C.",

The STN system plants had more flowers than those in the MIN system, and these attracted significantly more Meligethes aeneus, the only abundant and real pest in Estonia. Meligethes aeneus had two population peaks: the first during opening of the first flowers and the second, the new generation, during ripening of the pods. The number of new generation M. aeneus was almost four times greater in the STN than in the MIN crop. More carabids were caught in the MIN than in STN crop. The maximum abundance of carabids occurred two weeks before that of the new generation of M. aeneus, at the time when M. aeneus larvae were dropping to the soil for pupation and hence were vulnerable to predation by carabids.",

This was done by using three sowing times and four rye varieties in field trials conducted at three locations in 19992001. The early sown rye (beginning of August) was severely affected by diseases caused by Puccinia recondita and Microdochium nivale, whereas postponing sowing for two weeks after the recommended sowing time resulted in considerably less infection. The infection levels of diseases differed among rye varieties. Finnish rye varieties Anna and Bor 7068 were more resistant to snow mould and more winter hardy than the Polish variety Amilo, or the German hybrid varieties Picasso and Esprit. However, Amilo was the most resistant to leaf rust. In the first year snow mould appeared to be the primary cause of winter damage, but in the second year the winter damage was positively correlated with leaf rust. No significant correlation between frit fly infestation and winter damage or disease incidence of snow mould or leaf rust was established. The late sowing of rye (in the beginning of September) is recommended in Finland, particularly with hybrid varieties, to minimize the need for chemical plant protection in autumn.;",

Water content of silages was also determined by conventional forced-air oven drying at 105°C. When ethanol content of the silage was above 5 percent, there was a tendency for water contents obtained by the oven drying method to be over 5 percentage units greater than those obtained by solvent extraction gas chromatography.

Doubts were however raised whether these feeding regimes can maintain good growth performance and carcass quality of pigs. Three experiments were carried out to study different organic feeding regimes in weaned piglets and fattening pigs. In Experiment 1, we evaluated the use of peas and faba beans (0, 120, or 240 g kg-1) in diets for weaned piglets. Piglets fed pea diets performed as well as those fed the control diet, whereas the highest faba bean level resulted in reduced feed intake and growth performance. In Experiment 2, we studied the replacement (0, 33, or 67%) of rapeseed cake with blue lupins in fattening pig diets. The dietary lupin level had a quadratic effect on the weight gain of growing pigs, the best performance being observed at the 33% replacement level. However, dietary lupin level did not influence weight gain during the finishing period and total fattening. Back fat became softer with increasing dietary lupin levels. In Experiment 3, different protein supplements were compared in organic diets from weaning to slaughter. In two-phase feeding, the best performance was observed when whey protein was used as the protein supplement, followed by soya bean cake + whey protein and rapeseed cake + fish meal. The effects of a one-phase organic feeding regime with cold-pressed rapeseed cake + whey protein did not differ from those of the two-phase organic feeding regimes. Fattening pigs fed organic diets required from two to seven days longer to reach slaughter weight than those fed conventional diets. Pigs fed organic diets had fatter carcasses, but the eating quality of organic pork did not differ from that of pork from pigs fed conventional diets. Feed costs and the circulation rate of pigs, weaners in particular, were greater and carcass prices lower in the organic feeding regimes than in the conventional ones.;",

Simultaneously, reduced tillage practices have become popular due to energy saving and environmental concerns, as they may strengthen and improve the functioning of structured soil pore system. Soil aeration is affected by both compaction and reduced tillage through changes in soil structure and in the distribution of easily decomposable organic matter. We investigated whether a single wheeling by a 35 000 kg sugar-beet harvester in a Stagnic Luvisol derived from loess near Göttingen, Germany, influenced the gas transport properties (air permeability, gaseous macro- and microdiffusivities, oxygen diffusion rate) in the topsoil and subsoil samples, and whether the effects were different between long-term reduced tillage and mouldboard ploughing. Poor structure in the topsoil resulted in slow macro- and microscale gas transport at moisture contents near field capacity. The macrodiffusivities in the topsoil under conventional tillage were slower compared with those under conservation treatment, and soil compaction reduced the diffusivities by about half at the soil depths studied. This shows that even one pass with heavy machinery near field capacity impairs soil structure deep into the profile, and supports the view that reduced tillage improves soil structure and aeration compared with ploughing, especially in the topsoil.;",

The experiment comprised 24 Finnish Ayrshire bulls and 8 Holstein-Friesian bulls and included four treatments. The control diet (C) consisted of moderate digestible (653 g digestible organic matter in dry matter (DM) grass silage (450 g kg-1 DM), barley grain (275) and barley fibre (275) without protein supplementation. Three isonitrogenous experimental diets included also extra protein, i.e. (1) rapeseed meal (RSM) (supplementation 530 g DM per animal day-1), (2) wet distillers solubles (WDS) (600 g) and (3) a mixture of barley protein (90% of fresh weight) and wet distillers solubles (10) (BPWDS) (480 g). In all isonitrogenous diets the crude protein content of concentrate increased from 137 to 150 g kg-1 DM (9%) compared with the C diet. All bulls were fed total mixed ration ad libitum. The energy content of all diets was 11.6 MJ kg-1 DM. The live weight gain of the bulls tended to be higher with the BPWDS diet than with the C diet (C 1214 vs. BPWDS 1301 g d-1; p = 0.10), but the treatments had no significant effect on carcass gain, feed conversion or slaughter parameters. Only the BPWDS diet differed significantly from the C diet in DM (C 9.69 vs. BPWDS 10.38 kg DM d-1; p &lt; 0.01) and energy intake (C 112.4 vs. BPWDS 120.3 MJ d-1; p &lt; 0.05). The apparent organic matter digestibility (OMD) was 5% higher in the BPWDS diet than in the C diet (p &lt; 0.001), but the RSM and WDS diets did not differ from the C diet in OMD. The results indicate that the supply of protein in dairy bulls is most probably adequate with moderate digestible, well-preserved grass silage and barley-based concentrates when intake of digestible organic matter is high enough to support microbial protein synthesis in the rumen.;",

    "abstract": "Three trials in dairy cows were carried out to study the effects of replacing grass silage (GS) with wholecrop silage (WCS) made of barley (BS) or wheat (WS) harvested at dough stage with a dry matter (DM) concentration of 300-450 g kg-1. All silages were ensiled using a formic acid based additive 5 l t-1. Milk production responses to energy and protein supplementation of diets were studied. In Exp. 1, BS replaced GS at the rates of 0, 200, 400 or 600 g kg-1 forage DM. Also 10 kg of concentrate containing 0 or 2 kg of rape seed meal was fed. In Exp. 2, barley was harvested at three times (BS1, BS2, BS3) at one week intervals. Barley silages were fed as a mixture with GS (40:60) and in addition BS2 and GS alone. Silages were supplemented with a cereal based farm-made concentrate (FC) or a commercial compound having a lower concentration of starch than FC. In Exp. 3, barley and wheat were harvested at two week intervals, fed as a mixture with GS (40:60) and supplemented with low or high amount of concentrate. The fermentation quality of whole crop silages was good. Weather conditions and maturity affected the proportion of ear in the crop and subsequently the ratio of non-structural carbohydrates to NDF in the silage. The inclusion of WCS depressed diet OM digestibility depending on the digestibility of GS and the proportion of WCS in the diet. However, mixing GS and WCS did not depress intake. Subsequently the use of mixtures maintained or even increased milk yield as compared with GS diet in Exp. 2 and 3. In Exp. 1, higher proportions (400, 600 g kg-1) of BS decreased milk yield. Minor effects of growth stage on milk production were observed with barley whereas delaying wheat harvest increased milk yield. Different types and levels of concentrate induced mainly similar intake and milk yield responses with diets based on GS alone or on mixtures of GS and WCS. The synergistic effect of mixing GS and WCS was more positive in experiments where the protein concentration of concentrate was high (200 g kg-1 DM).;",

    "abstract": "Seed viability and vigour play important roles in seedling emergence, plant stand establishment and yield potential. The majority of cereal fields in Finland are typically sown with farm saved seed (FSS). If the quality of the seed is not known, there can be insidious yield reduction. This research was conducted to study the effects of seed quality on seedling emergence rate, seedling number and yielding capacity. The study comprised three-year field experiments conducted during 20072009, established at three sites: Jokioinen, Nousiainen and Ylistaro. Spring barley cultivars Saana (2007) and Annabell (2008-2009) were sown at rate of 500 germinating seeds m-2. Five seed lots were included as treatments: farm saved seed (FSS); downgraded seed 2.7 mm); upgraded seed &gt;2.7 mm with disinfection (FSS&gt;2.7 mm + dis); and commercial certified seed with disinfection (CCS). Up- and down-graded seed lots (FSS2.7 mm, and FSS&gt;2.7 mm + dis) all originated from the FSS. Seedling emergence rate was measured from the time when coleoptiles started to break through the soil surface. The number of seedlings (3 × 1 m row per plot) was recorded at five-day intervals four times from the same rows. Plots were harvested at physiological maturity and grain yield (kg ha-1), hectolitre weight (HLW, kg) single grain weight (SGW, mg) and grain protein content (%) were recorded. Seed lots of CCS and FSS&gt;2.7 mm + dis enhanced seedling emergence rate and increased the number of plants compared with other treatments. These two seed lots also produced the highest grain yield and had the lowest grain protein. Seed quality had an apparent effect on plant stand establishment and grain yield. A seed lot effect was evident despite identical targeted sowing rates that took into account germination rate and seed weight. Therefore, differences in seedling emergence and yielding capacity were likely outcomes of variation in seed vigour among the five treatments.;",

The non-parametric method Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to estimate the total technical, pure technical and scale efficiency of Estonian grain farms in 20002004. Mean total technical efficiency varied from 0.70 to 0.78. Of the grain farms 62% are operating under increasing returns to scale. Solely based on the DEA model it is not possible to determine optimum farm scale and the range of Estonian farm sizes operating efficiently is extensive. The most pure technically efficient farms were the smallest and the largest but the productivity of small farms is low compared to larger farms because of their small scale. Therefore, they are the least competitive. Since pre-accession period to the EU, large input slacks of capital have replaced the former excessive use of labour and land. This raises the question about the effects on efficiency of the EUs investment support schemes in new member states.;",

Rapeseed oil and rapeseed oil methyl ester were both stored for a period of time and their fuel characteristics (e.g. acid number) had changed from those set by the fuel standards and are considered to have an effect on its biodegradation. The phytotoxicity was tested using two different types of barley cultivars: Saana and Vilde. The phytotoxic effect on the barley varieties was determined, after the growth season, by measuring the total biomass growth and the mass of 1000 kernels taken from the tests plots. Also visual inspection was used to determine what the effects on the barley growth were. These measurements suggest that both RSO and RME have a negative impact on barley sprouts and therefore the total growth of the barley. RSO and RME both decreased the total amount of harvested phytomass. The weight of 1000 kernels increased with low concentrations of these contaminants and high contamination levels reduced the mass of the kernels. The results of these experiments suggest that the stored rapeseed oil and rapeseed oil methyl ester are both phytotoxic materials and therefore will cause substantial loss of vegetation in the case of a fuel spill. The RSO and RME biodegraded effectively in the measurement period of 28 days under OECD test conditions: the degree of biodegradation being over 60%. The biodegradation in the ground water was much slower: the degree of biodegradation being about 10% after 28 days.;",

For this reason the figures on the milk producing ability, and the connection between the milk yield and other characteristics of the cow or its calf, are bound to be uncertain. The general composition of reindeer milk is in fair agreement with results reported by other researchers (Tables 1, 4 and 5). Individual differences in the milk producing ability could clearly be detected. The correlations between the milk quantity and the constituents were usually not significant. The association between the dam’s spring weight and the protein percentage was significant (r = —0.47**). The range of the calves’ weights at birth was to a large degree mainteined during the entire period of growth (Table 9). The weight and growth of the calves was clearly dependent on the weight or on the size of the dam. The results obtained did not indicate any connection between the milk production characteristics of the dams and the growth of the calves (Tables 11 and 12). The spring weight of the dam has a more decisive influence on the growth of the calf than the birth weight of the latter. The results obtained seem to indicate that in the breeding for growth capacity, selection on the basis of the weight or size of the dams os of conclusive importance. In spite of the individual variations existing in the milk producing ability of reindeer cows, the importance ofthe quantity and composition of the milk seems to be covered by the genetically determined growth factors. As the size of reindeer can be determined more easily than the weight, the combined measure, (body length + chest girth), seems tobe a more suitable basis for evaluation.",

By including the derived demand changes in an agricultural sector model, we show that livestock production in Finland, incentivised by national production-linked payments for milk and bovine animals, would decrease by much less than 20% due to the complex nature of agricultural production and trade. Overall, assuming unchanged consumer preferences and agricultural policy, a 20% reduction in red meat consumption is not likely to lead to a substantial decrease in livestock production or changed land use, or greenhouse gas emissions, from Finnish agriculture.",

To this end, an optimization model is developed that includes gypsum amendment as well as matching phosphorus fertilization to crop need and the level of soil phosphorus reserves as phosphorus load mitigation measures, with soil phosphorus reserves measured by soil test phosphorus (STP). The optimal extent of gypsum amendment is then determined simultaneously with optimal fertilization use as a function of field STP level. The results indicate that whether or not gypsum amendment is economically feasible depends on field erosion susceptibility and STP level. When accounting for the costs and benefits to the society on the whole, gypsum treatment suits best to mitigation of phosphorus losses from soils with excessively high phosphorus reserves; once a threshold STP level is reached, gypsum amendment is optimally given up. This threshold level depends on field slope and on society’s willingness to pay for water quality.",

In addition to the gypsum effects, a macropore flow description was added to ICECREAM. First, a sensitivity analysis was performed for the new macropore parameters, retrieved from a literature survey. After this, the model was calibrated for a reference period by setting of the macropore parameters to correspond to the P losses observed in the catchment experiment. Next, the effect of gypsum was added to the model in line with laboratory and field experiments that suggested decreased P losses and changed hydraulic properties of the soil. Finally, the modified model was verified for four seasons after the gypsum amendment in the catchment experiment. The model was able to simulate the P losses in three out of the four seasons. According to the simulations, gypsum reduced total P losses by 44%. Although the effect of gypsum on P and erosion is a complex process, our relatively simple modifications to the ICECREAM model described the impact with reasonable accuracy. However, to increase confidence in the performance of the model, it should be tested under other environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Aerobic spoilage of silages occurs frequently and is undesirable because it reduces both its nutritive and hygienic quality. Silage inoculants containing heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, like Lactobacillus buchneri, have already been proven to improve aerobic stability by augmented production of acetic acid, which inhibits yeasts. In this study, the effect of L. buchneri on fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of alfalfa-ryegrass silage, red clover silage and maize silage was assessed using microsilos. Two dosages, 1×105 and 3×105 cfu g-1 of fresh matter, were compared to untreated control silage. Inoculation with L. buchneri clearly altered the fermentation characteristics of alfalfa-ryegrass and red clover silage, resulting in a significantly higher aerobic stability at both dosages. The effects of L. buchneri inoculation on maize silage were less clear, but nevertheless the aerobic stability of maize silage inoculated with 1×105 cfu g-1 of fresh matter was significantly higher compared to the untreated silage.",

The revealed comparative advantage index is used to analyze the levels, compositions, and evolutions in patterns of development in the export competitiveness of meat products and their levels of stability at the product level. Except for some niche meat products, a larger number of the EU-27 member states have experienced comparative disadvantages on global markets over the analysed years of 2000 to 2011. The revealed comparative advantages on the global markets are the most robust for Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Denmark, Poland, Cyprus and Hungary. The revealed comparative advantage indices and their survival rates differ across the meat product groups. The heterogeneity in export competitiveness of the EU-27 member states suggests the importance of the differentiation of meat products in competitive export specialization on global markets.",

Impacts depend on the vulnerability of the object, production system and their resilience to climatic variability. The station-wise temperature observations from the Finnish Meteorological Institute for a time period of 54 years (1961‒2014) were interpolated to a regular 10 km × 10 km grid covering the whole country. Several successive time slices were used to measure the likelihood for: 1) elevated temperatures of a) ≥1 °C above normal for three weeks, b) ≥2 °C above normal for two weeks and c) ≥3 °C above normal for one week, and 2) heatwaves with daily maximum temperature &gt;25 °C for: a) 5 days (short) or b) 14 days (long episode). We also estimated the likelihood of warm winds in the early growing season which may enhance pest migration. We found large spatial and temporal variations in the likelihoods of elevated temperatures with many impacts on crop production, animal farming and welfare. In fact, only 1 °C temperature elevation may already be harmful, though in some cases also beneficial depending on region and vulnerability or adaptation of the object and production system. Though we show only some examples of the potential impacts of temperature variation on high latitude agro-ecosystems, these data are valuable as such for much wider applications in agriculture and beyond that.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper the effect of lime on the mobilization of peat nitrogen was studied using incubation experiments under laboratory conditions. In the first experiment in which 13 samples of virgin peat soils were incubated for four months at 7°C, lime caused a marked nitrification of ammonium nitrogen in three samples, and a fairly low increase in the ammonium nitrogen content of five samples. The accumulation of total mineral nitrogen was benefited by lime in five samples and only in one of them could a marked increase be detected. In the second experiment the amounts of lime applied to five peat samples corresponded to 4000, 8000 or 12 000 kg/ha of CaCO3. At the end of an incubation period of four months at 9—15°C the total amounts of mineral nitrogen accumulated did not depend on the fate of liming, as did the nitrification in SCp-and BCp-samples, and also, in part, in the Sp- and CSp-samples. After the prolonged incubation up to 12 months the amount of lime applied had little or no effect upon the accumulation of nitrate-nitrogen or total mineral nitrogen except in the SCp-sample in which a positive correlation between these figures existed. Traces of nitrite-nitrogen were detected in some of the samples incubated for four months with the heaviest applications of lime. In the third experiment carried out at 7°C the treatment with lime was equal to that in the second series, but half of the pots were treated with ammonium nitrate corresponding to 100 kg/ha of nitrogen. The effect of lime on the treated samples appeared to be similar to that in the untreated one. Owing to the large variation, the fate of applied mineral nitrogen could not be distinctly detected. The loss of ammonium nitrogen through volatilization from the most heavily limed pots may be a possible explanation for the lower amounts of total mineral nitrogen in the incubated BCp-samples. Some reasons for these variable results are discussed and attention is also paid to the importance of nitrification on the nitrogen nutrition of plants.",

Analyses and estimations of different P fractions (total P, PO4-P, and particulate P) in leachate following simulated rainfall events on undisturbed topsoil cores sampled 6–8 years after liming revealed lower total P and particulate P concentrations in both lime treatments compared to the untreated control. Two sugar beet trial sites with soil pH ≤7.2 before liming showed an increase in sugar yield for structure lime and ground limestone as an effect of increased concentration of soil potassium (K-AL) and/or lower Aphanomyces root rot potential compared to the untreated control. The yield of winter wheat was not affected by the application of either type of lime at sites with pH &gt;7.2 but the yield of oilseed rape decreased after the application of structure lime.",

Conventionally managed farm groups were constructed based on propensity matching, selecting the closest counterparts to organically managed farms (n=15). These groups, each containing 15 farms, were differentiated by an increasing number of matching variables. The first group was matched based on geographical location, milk quota, and milking cow units. In the second match, the proportion of milking cows in the total cattle herd was added, and in the third, the ratio of milk delivered to milk produced and concentrate usage per dairy cow were included. The analysis showed that the conventionally managed farms (n=185) had higher greenhouse gas emissions (1.42 vs 0.98 kg CO2 per 2.78 MJ of edible energy from milk and meat, calculated as GWP100-AR4) and higher N intensity (6.9 vs 5.0 kg N input per kg N output) compared to the organic farms (N=15). When comparing emissions per kg of energy-corrected milk (ECM) delivered, conventional farms also emitted more CO2 (1.07 vs 0.8 kg CO2 per kg ECM). Furthermore, conventionally managed farms showed lower gross margins both in terms of NOK per 2.78 MJ edible energy delivered (5.8 vs 6.5 NOK) and per milking cow unit (30 100 vs 34 400 NOK), and they used less land (2.9 vs 3.6 m 2 per 2.78 MJ edible energy delivered) compared to organic farms. No differences were observed among the three conventionally managed groups in terms of emissions, N intensity, land use occupation, and gross margin.",

    "abstract": "We examine cost-effectiveness and social net benefits of using soil amendments, gypsum and structure lime, in reducing phosphorus loading while accounting for the climate emissions from both amendments. Recent field experiments and large-scale pilots in Finland and Sweden suggest that both gypsum and structure lime improve soil structure and can reduce total P loading from clayey fields but differ as soil amendments. While gypsum does not change soil pH, structure lime helps to adjust it to a desired level. Drawing on literature, gypsum is postulated to reduce both dissolved (25%) and particulate losses (50%) of phosphorus, while structure lime is postulated to reduce only particulate phosphorus (40%). Life-cycle analysis is applied to determine greenhouse gas emissions from both soil amendments. We examine 5 and 10 years impacts on phosphorus loss by choosing doses and their timing accordingly. Both amendments provide the highest water quality benefits on erodible soils or soils with high soil phosphorus. Accounting for climate issues drastically changes the picture. Greenhouse gas emissions from gypsum production are 14.43 kgCO2e ha-1, and those from structure lime from pristine materials are 1837 kgCO2e ha-1. Cost-effectiveness of P load reduction including carbon price of GHG emissions is 59 € kg-1P for gypsum and 122 € kg-1P for structure lime. At the national level (application to 0.54 Mha), differences in greenhouse gas emissions without soil emissions are huge and in favour of gypsum (0.048 Mt and 1.04 Mt). Structure lime from recycled zero-emission materials performs well but its supply is very limited.",

Experimental design was a cyclic change-over with six dietary treatments. The treatments in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement consisted of either untreated (UB) or heat-moisture treated barley (TB), given without protein supplementation (control) or with untreated or heat-moisture treated RSM. Grass silage was given ad libitum and the concentrates at a rate of 10 kg/d. For the RSM diets, 2 kg/d of the basal concentrate was replaced with either untreated or treated RSM. Treatment of barley decreased silage intake, the effect being greater when the supplement did not contain RSM. There was no effect on milk yield, but due to the lower milk fat content, energy corrected milk yield was lower in cows given TB than in those given UB. Feeding the TB diets was also associated with lower milk urea content, and with increased milk protein content but not protein yield. Faster initial rate of gas production in vitro suggested that the treatment of barley increased the rate of fermentation. Compared with the control diets, RSM supplementation significantly increased silage intake, milk yield, milk protein content and yields of all milk constituents. Heat-moisture treatment of RSM did not produce any further production response.",

    "abstract": "Future changes in atmospheric composition and consequent global and regional climate change are of increasing concern to policy makers, planners and the public. However, predictions of these changes are uncertain. In the absence of single, firm predictions, the next best approach is to identify sets of plausible future conditions termed scenarios. This paper focuses on the development of climate change scenarios for northern high latitude regions. Three methods of scenario development can be identified; use of analogues having conditions similar to those expected in the study region, application of general circulation model results, and composite methods that combine information from different sources. A composite approach has been used to produce scenarios of temperature, precipitation, carbon dioxide and sea-level change for Finland up to 2100, as part of the Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change (SILMU). Tools for applying these scenarios in impact assessment studies, including stochastic weather generators and spatial downscaling techniques, are also examined. The SILMU scenarios attempt to capture uncertainties both in future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere and in the global climate response to these emissions. Two types of scenario were developed: (i) simple “policy-oriented” scenarios and (ii) detailed “scientific” scenarios. These are compared with new model estimates of future climate and recent observed changes in climate over certain high latitude regions.",

    "abstract": "Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to characterize a part of a sea buckthorn gene bank collected for plant breeding purposes. Molecular markers were generated in 55 cultivars and accessions, representing five subspecies of Hippophae rhamnoides L. and intraspecific hybrids between different subspecies. Sixty-three markers were used to generate a Dice's similarity coefficient matrix of pairwise comparisons between individual RAPD profiles. Cluster (UPGMA) and principal co-ordinate analyses, based on this matrix, revealed clustering of plants into groups which generally correspond to their taxonomic classification or geographic origin. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was found useful for estimating components of genetic variation between and within taxonomic and geographic groups of accessions and cultivars. Whereas both alternatives for grouping the material (taxonomic or geographic origin) resulted in significant between-group variation, the major part of molecular variance (approximately 75%) was still attributed to variation within groups. We conclude that the RAPD analysis is useful for clarification of taxonomic and geographic origin of accessions and cultivars of sea buckthorn.",

Samples were lysed either enzymatically or by alkaline treatment followed by enzymatic amplification of DNA from the ZFY/ZFX locus. Sex diagnosis could be done after the digestion of the amplified product by restriction endonucleases. Ovine and bovine embryos could be sexed from biopsies as small as 1-4 cells. Some embryos were split into 2-4 sections, which were amplified separately. Blind trials with such samples demonstrated that the method was highly accurate, even when embryo biopsy was done under farm conditions. The protocol involves an in-built control. This eliminates the need for autosomal control primers, which often inhibit the amplification of the Y-chromosome-specific DNA, especially when a small amount of template is used.",

The swards were mixtures of timothy and meadow fescue. The grasses were ensiled unwilted with formic acid. Fixed or mixed regression procedure of SAS was used to investigate the relationships between composition of grasses and respective silages and to develop regression equations for predicting silage in vivo organic matter digestibility (OMD) from herbage pepsincellulase organic matter solubility (OMS). The silages were well preserved showing only limited amounts of secondary fermentation products. The silage dry matter (DM), crude protein and neutral detergent fibre contents could be estimated relatively accurately from grass variables as judged by relatively small prediction errors (RMSEmixed = 3.6, 8.1 and 18 g (kg DM)-1, respectively). The average OMS of grasses was significantly higher than that of respective silages (779 vs. 756 g (kg DM)-1, P &lt; 0.001). However, silage OMD was equally accurately predicted from grass and silage OMS (RMSEmixed = 15.1 and 15.8 g (kg DM)-1, respectively). When predicting silage OMD from OMS, specific equations should be used for primary growth and regrowth silages, because the slopes and intercepts of correction equations were numerically though not statistically significantly different. It is concluded that silage composition and digestibility can be reliably predicted from herbage characteristics provided that silages are well preserved with moderate ensiling losses.;",

    "abstract": "The study was concerned with the competitive strategies of small food-processing firms in rural Finland and their ability to achieve and maintain a competitively advantaged position in relation to larger food companies in the dynamic and mature food market. Competitive strategies were approached from the resource-based view (RBV) that emphasises internal firm factors as sources of competitive advantage and long-term success. As strategic choices, differentiation was specifically considered. The main objective was to explain the relationships between resources, competitive advantage and firm success. To understand the ambiguous nature of the resources in the small-scale food production context, the study introduced a distinction between strategic resources and basic resources and the strategic relationship between them. The empirical part of the study was based on quantitative analyses of the survey data collected from 238 small (less than 20 persons), food-processing firms in rural Finland. The sample firms represented different branches of the food industry and 39% of them operated in connection with a farm. The linkage between resources, competitive advantage and firm success was investigated by means of cluster analysis, mean comparisons and LISREL modelling. The results demonstrated that there are some typical features relating to small-scale food production in Finland. The results also revealed that small-scale, rural food processing firms do not constitute a homogenous group of their own, but that different strategies among small firms can be identified as well. The analyses proved that a linkage between resources, competitive advantage and firm success can be identified, which is consistent with resource-based logic. However, according to the findings, following a particular strategy does not automatically ensure that a firm will achieve success. The analysis also showed that strategic resources and basic resources are strongly interlinked and that the relationship between basic resources and success was, however, considerably stronger than the link between strategic resources and success. The study concludes that resource deployment  in terms of both strategic resources and basic resources  should be balanced in order for a small food-processing firm to have the opportunity to establish a relatively favourable position in the market. Based on the results, theoretical, methodological and managerial implications are suggested and ideas for the further research are provided.;",

    "abstract": "From 1977 to 1987, variety trials were conducted at two test sites in order to determine the agronomic value of old oat varieties as compared to that of the varieties presently grown. The trial sites were located at two breeding stations of the Hankkija Plant Breeding Institute, those of Nikkilä (61° 33' N latitude) and Anttila (60° 25' N latitude). The variety trials were performed according to the methods of Partially Balanced Lattices, and the results and their summary were computed according to the Nearest Neighbour Analysis. Eleven oat varieties released by the Institute between 1921 and 1982 as well as the old native oat variety from Ylitornio and the American oat variety Wasa, released in the 1920s, were all tested simultaneously. The materials are presented in Table 1, the test environment in Table 2. The main findings are shown in Tables 3 &amp; 4 and in Figures 1—5. The correlations between the age of the varieties and their characteristics are presented, in order of quality, in Table 5. The field experiments showed that intense progress inbreeding work is reflected as increased crop yield, shortening of the straw, improved strength of the straw, and decreased husk content. In the trials the crop yield of the newest variety, Hankkijan Vouti variety, averaged 51 per cent more than the Ylitornio land race variety. The mean improvement in these properties achieved in 1921—-1982by means of breeding work was: an increase in crop yield of approximately 40 per cent; shortening of the straw by roughly 20 per cent; reduction of the tendency to lodging by about half; and lowering of the husk content by some 2 percentage points. In contrast, no constant advances could be shown for the earliness at heading or ripening, the 1 000 kernel weight, the hectolitre weight, the crude protein content or resistance to Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV). The 1 000 kernel weight and the hectolitre weight had risen from those of the local oat variety, whereafter development ceased to occur. The study also investigated the ratio between genotype and environmental effects. In the experimental series, environmental factors had an effect on determining the time needed for ripening, the crude protein content, the length of the straw, the hectrolitre weight and crop yield that was at least five times greater than the effect of genotype. Genotype proved to have a stronger influence on the 1 000 kernel weight, for which the variance component of genotype was three fold that of the environmental component. The heritability values in the experimental series ranged from 0.19 (for BYDV infection) to 0.77 (for time to heading).",

It remains an under-utilised crop and it contributes less than 0.1% to the total oat area in Finland. In general, limited interest in growing naked oat more extensively is attributed to its weaknesses, which ironically result from nakedness that improves the quality of the crop. This paper reviews the available literature and assesses the balance of the arguments for and against naked oats. Results from the study were transformed into quantitative variables and analysed for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) using an analytical hierarchical process. As the importance of different SWOT-factors depends largely on targeted end-use of yield, separate analyses were done for use of naked oats as on-farm feed and as an input for the feed and food industry. If we aim at increasing area under naked oat in Finland, the most feasible starting point would be on-farm feed. In this case, strengths (high nutritional quality and energy content) outweighed weaknesses (sensitivity to grain damage) and threats (problems in germination). Increasing naked oat production in this respect is likely to encourage solving the remaining problems that deter industry. Threats (availability) regarding the feed industry and weaknesses (incomplete expression of nakedness) in the food industry out-weighed strengths (high nutritional quality and storability) and opportunities (potential niches).;",

    "abstract": "This paper presents price transmission models explaining the farm-to-retail price spread and degree of competition in the meat marketing chains during the period of economic transition in Slovenia. The meat marketing chains in Slovenia are characterised by relatively large processing and marketing margins, which are expected to decline with market deregulation and integration into the international markets. As results of the economic restructuring and policy reforms, competitive market pressures in a marketing margin determination have increased, inducing pressures for efficiency improvements in the vertical market integration from the farm to the retail stage in the Slovenian meat sector. Co-integration models are applied to estimate vertical market integration and to assess the degree of price competition in the Slovenian beef and pork marketing chains. The tested econometric models confirmed the existence of the long run market integration in the meat chain and the speed of adjustment of price changes. Farm-gate meat prices are identified as weakly exogenous, indicating the crucial role of supply side processing and marketing factors in the retail meat price determination. The results of structural tests suggest a long-run mark-up price strategy in the beef, and a competitive price strategy in the pork, chain as the outcome of policy reforms. The increased competitive market pressures are very likely to increase efficiency in the beef markets. Efficiency improvements in the Slovenian food markets are needed in the increased competitive market pressures of the enlarged European Union markets.;",

However, in todays global food markets, the industry faces strict challenges in the development of new processes and applications where the prior experience is unsatisfactory or insufficient. The storage stability of novel oat products can be greatly enhanced by taking the mechanisms of lipid deterioration into account, and by adjusting the processing conditions accordingly so that these reactions can be minimized. The lipid reactions in oat products result in two different unwanted properties: bitter, astringent, taste or a rancid flavor. Chemically, these properties are associated to enzymatic hydrolysis of ester bonds and non-enzymatic oxidation of unsaturated fatty acyl chains respectively. The processing history oat product has a huge impact on which of these reactions predominates in oat products. The review focuses on the reactions of lipids in processed oat products, and identifies factors that are critical for enhanced shelf-life.;",

Using different threshing settings at different grain moisture contents, it was investigated whether grain moisture at threshing and combine harvester settings affected hull content and its relationship to germination capacity. Naked groats were stored at room temperature and analysed for protein content and fatty acid composition to determine storability. Grain moisture content at threshing had contrary effects on hull content and degree of hull retention in different years. Small grains tended to retain hulls more tightly during threshing. Grain filling capacity appears to be the dominant factor determining degree of nakedness rather than stage of maturity. The postulated protective nature of hulls was confirmed only for cultivar Lisbeth. Highly viable samples of grain of cv. Lisbeth, threshed at normal settings, contained a higher percentage of hulls than those with low germination capacity, while for cv. Bullion, a protective effect of the hulls was not evident. Grain moisture content at threshing did not affect protein content of naked cultivars, but some differences in fatty acid composition were recorded. Changes in lipid composition and volatile oxidation products during storage of groats were relatively moderate, indicating no major problems related to storage when naked oat was dried well.;",

The aim of this study is to predict the diversity effects of agricultural policy reforms in which direct aid payments are disconnected from production, and compare the outcomes with the effects of a policy in which Common Agricultural Policy support is coupled to production. The study employs a dynamic regional sector model of Finnish agriculture. The sector model predicts regional agricultural land use, numbers of livestock, stocking densities, pesticide application areas, and nutrient balances. Diversity of agricultural land use is measured by Shannons diversity index. The results indicate that if agricultural support is independent from production, the amount of fallow land will increase considerably in the future. This will decrease the diversity of agricultural land use at landscape level, but may not be harmful at species level since green fallow has some positive effects, especially on the densities and abundance of farmland birds. Instead, the decrease in bovine animals is likely to run down biological diversity, since it simplifies crop rotation and diminishes grazing.;",

Experiments were carried out with cultivar Bounty during 20002002 at the Estonian Agricultural University. Results showed that fertilization had a positive effect on the yield of first grade fruits with both mulches. With plastic mulch, fertilization had a positive influence on vitamin C content. With straw mulch, fertilization decreased fruit damage. None of the experimental factors had an impact on the content of soluble solids. We concluded that injecting fertilizer solution into the soil under plastic mulch is an effective and inexpensive way to avoid a decrease in fruit size in the third year of production. Vitamin C content was negatively influenced by plant age, and in the three-year-old plantation, smaller fruits contained more vitamin C than larger fruits.;",

Soil was compacted most severely when till age and drilling were performed under wet conditions about one week be for enormal sowing time. The sub soil at the depth of 35-40 cm was compacted only under very wet conditions. The grain yield of wheat was significantly reduced when the volume of large pores was reduced to about 10 % or less. Porosity measurements showed that the severely compacted soil almost completely recovered from one spring to the next. Theoretical calculations suggested that compaction by normal traffic does not cause a shortage of oxygen at least in the inter-crumb pores of soil if the soil surface structure is not dispersed and encrusted. The decrease in crop growth by compaction is primarily due to mechanical impedance, which slows down development of the root system.",

Monitoring losses of potentially bioavailable forms of PP is expensive, calling for other ways to predict them. Such predictions could be based on soil loss and available soil P indices, e.g., agronomic P status. To study correlations between P pools in runoff versus soil P saturation (by Mehlich 3 extraction; DPSM3) and acetate soil test P (PAc), 15 clayey soils of south Finland were subjected to laboratory rainfall simulation. Runoff from these simulations was analyzed for concentrations of suspended soil (TSS), dissolved molybdate-reactive P (DRP), total P (TP), and, as normalized to soil loss, potentially bioavailable forms of PP: desorbable (anion exchange resin-extractable, AER-PP/TSS) and redox-labile PP (bicarbonate- dithionite-extractable, BD-PP/TSS). Correlation coefficients (r2) between DPSM3 and DRP, AER-PP/ TSS, and BD-PP/TSS equaled 0.92, 0.77, and 0.45, respectively. Runoff P forms were also correlated to soil PAc with r2 values of 0.84, 0.56, and 0.58 for DRP, AER-PP/TSS, and BD-PP/TSS, respectively. Prediction of soil loss-normalized concentrations of potentially bioavailable PP by the agronomic PAc test was considered possible. However, such predictions have a high degree of uncertainty, evidenced by comparison to published field data. Acceptably accurate predictive equations would require a large material as a basis for their construction, and soils should probably also be grouped according to other soil properties that would account for variation in P sorption capacity.;",

Results showed that the highest economic values, when expressed in genetic standard deviations, were obtained for total number of piglets born (2.07 per piglet), feed conversion ratio (2.07 per feed unit per kg), and lean meat percentage (1.69 per %). Economic values for litter size, piglet mortality, sows length of productive life, and lean meat percentage increased when subsidies were not accounted for in the bio-economic model. Results show further that meat quality should have 1520 percent weight in the Finnish production trait index in order to prevent its deterioration. When the selection weights are 1520% for meat quality, the expected loss in genetic gain is approximately 3 percent for other production traits when compared to selection indices where meat quality traits are not included.;",

    "abstract": "This paper assesses policy-related transaction costs (PRTC) associated with the main agricultural and agri-environmental policy instruments in Finland. We find that area-based income support measures entail low transaction costs as expressed in percent of payments, not only in Finland but also in other European countries. Moreover, transaction costs in the Finnish agri-environmental programme are surprisingly low. Within the agri-environmental programme, transaction costs increase with more targeted and differentiated agri-environmental measures. For the basic mandatory measures, these costs are even lower than the transaction costs for the area-based income support measures. What regards the most differentiated policy measures such as conservation of special biotopes or establishment of riparian buffer zones, transaction costs increase considerably. Combining these findings with the actual targets of the Finnish agricultural policies provides indirect evidence about the impacts of policy instruments and the efficiency of administration in implementing the instruments. For area-based income support measures, the Finnish administration seems to work very efficiently. For water protection targets, enforcement and division of labour within the administration seem to be insufficient.;",

Na--alginate beads each containing one shoot tip, dehydrated for 2 days in 0.75M sucrose and desiccated to 20% moisture content (fresh weight basis), gave 60% recovery after exposure to liquid nitrogen. Regenerated shoots showed no differences in length and leaf shape compared to the mother plant. Multiplication rate and rooting ability of cryopreserved shoots were lower than those of untreated controls after one subculture, but were completely restored following the third subculture. Fifteen cryopreserved lines derived from single buds were used for genetic analyses by RAPDs and SSRs, in comparison with the mother plant. In RAPD analysis, of a total of 24 primers, only 15 showed reproducible and well resolved bands and were further used. These primers produced a total of 66 fragments ranging from about 500 to 2500 base pair size. SSR (microsatellite) marker amplification was performed using 19 primers which produced 57 reproducible fragments. Microsatellites fragments ranged from 60 to 600 base pairs. Both RAPDs and SSRs did not reveal any polymorphism between cryopreserved lines and the original genotype, suggesting that cryopreservation, using encapsulation-dehydration, does not affect genetic stability of wild pear.;",

    "abstract": "Since 1995 the Finnish Agri-Environmental Program has set limits for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertiliser application rates in agriculture. The decrease in N and P fertiliser recommendations, and especially the decrase in N and P amounts applied in practice, has raised the question of whether N and P application rates are too low to produce high quality yields. The test weight, 1000 grain weight and protein concentrations measured in 19902005 by the Cereal Inspection Unit of the Finnish Food Safety Authority were analysed against soil type, location and NP fertiliser data. The purpose of this study was to document and statistically analyse changes in fertiliser use, important quality factors and the connection between fertiliser use and grain quality of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oats (Avena sativa L.), winter rye (Secale cereale L.) as well as spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Applications of N and P fertiliser, test weight and 1000 grain weight have decreased in Finland since 1990-1994. Protein content began to decrease in 19951999, but then increased in 20002005. The statistical analysis showed that reduced N application rates are associated with lower test weight, 1000 grain weight and grain protein concentration. In addition, low P application rates were associated with reduced 1000 grain weight and protein concentration in some instances, although protein concentration also increased in winter wheat grain. The magnitude of grain quality reduction was not solely explicable through N and P application rates. During the observation period many other factors changed in Finnish cereal production and, for example, the decrease in cereal prices, increase of reduced tillage and low investments in drainage and liming could have been associated with decreased grain quality.;",

    "abstract": "This study was carried out on Helminthosporium species found on cereals (Avena sativa L., Hordeum vulgare L., Triticum aestivum L., Secale cereale L.) and couch grass (Agropycon repens (L.)PB.) The objective was to ascertain their distribution and general significance in Finland. The results were obtained from samples of cereals gathered in 2040 fields all over the country during the growing season 1971 1973. The samples of couch grass (approx. 170 samples) were collected infields and the borders of fields. The fungi in all the samples were examined by microscope, using the blotter method and with cultures. Many Helminthosporium species were found to be very common and abundant on cereals, especially in 1972, throughout the country and as far as Lapland. The imperfect stages (conidia) of the fungi occurred dominantly and in abundance, whereas the perfect stages of the fungi were found only occasionally at all times. Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechs. on Agropyron repens was exceptional in this respect. The most widespread and common Helminthosporium fungi were the following species: H. avenae Eidam was found to be very common and abundant in more than 60 per cent of the oat fields and in nearly 90 per cent of the localities that were studied throughout the country. These figures apply to seedlings as well. H. gramineum Rabenh. ex Schlecht was found frequently in more than 30 per cent of the spring barley fields and in about 55 per cent of the localities that were studied. It was very common and abundant in Ostrobothnia and the northern parts of the country and was frequent on six-rowed barley, too. H. teres Sacc. was found to be common and abundant in nearly 60 per cent of the spring barley fields and in nearly 90 per cent of the localities that were studied. These figures apply to the seedlings as well and are especially representative of observations made in the western and southern parts of the country. The fungus was more common on six-rowed than on two-rowed barley H. tritici-repentis Died, was found to be moderately common in southern and southwestern Finland as follows: in nearly 30 per cent of the spring wheat fields and in 40 per cent of the localities studied; in 17 per cent of the winter wheat fields and in 23 the winter rye fields; for both the latter mentioned moderate abundance was observed in more than 50 per sent of the localities studied. On Agropyron repens the fungus was very common and abundant in 50 per cent of the samples and in nearly 60 per cent of the localities studied. In addition, the perfect stage of the fungi, Pyrenophora triticirepentis (Died.) Drechs. with mature ascoma and ascospores was found in about 1/4 of the samples examined throughout the country. H. sativum Pammel, King and Bakke was found to be moderately common and abundant in about 30 per cent of the spring barley fields and in 55 per cent of the localities studied throughout the country, being most common in southern and southwestern Finland. The fungus was more common on two-rowed than on six-rowed barley. The fungus was observed to be moderately common in 9 per cent of spring wheat fields and in nearly 20 per cent of the localities studied. In all fields H. sativum appeared sporadically also in seedlings on spring barley and spring wheat as well as on the roots of barley. The fungus was found to be moderately common also in oat fields, but only in 1972, whereas on winter wheat and winter rye its occurrence was only rare and sporadic. An undetermined Helminthosporium species, like H. gramineum or H. teres, was found to be sparce but moderately common, in about 10 per cent of the spring wheat fields and in nearly 20 per cent of the localities studied. It occurred only occasionally on winter wheat and on winter rye fields. It is not known how fungi damage affects crop yields. At least H. gramineum, H. teres and H. sativum on spring barley, as well as H. avenae on oats, caused severe damage to plants and occurred commonly throughout the country.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an economic sector level analysis of the effectiveness of different policy measures in decreasing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) surpluses from agriculture in order to reduce nutrient runoff from agricultural fields to watercourses and to improve water quality of surface waters. Assuming no changes in the EU level policies after CAP reform 2003 we focus on national level policy measures such as full or partial de-coupling of national support from production, payments for reduced nutrient surpluses of N and P, and N fertiliser tax. None of the analysed policy measures is superior one with respect to environmental performance, since full decoupling of national support would be the most effective in reducing P surpluses while payment for reduced nutrient surplus performed best with respect to N surpluses. Economic performance (farmers compliance cost per %-reduction of N or P surplus) of full and partial de-coupling of national support is clearly better than that of specialised agri-environmental policy instruments, because both decoupling scenarios result in the increase of farmers income in comparison to base scenario, and thus compliance costs are in fact negative in these two cases. Our analysis confirms the fact that the overall policy package matters a lot for the effectiveness of agrienvironmental policy measures. Environmental performance of agri-environmental policy measures may be significantly reduced, if they are implemented jointly with production coupled income support policies. Thus, in order to increase the effectiveness of agri-environmental policy measures agricultural income support policies should be decoupled from production and this alone would bring substantial reduction in nutrient surpluses.;",

The competition treatments included no competition and four levels of competition with barley, differing in terms of germination time. The success of A. retroflexus was measured as growth (height and biomass) and seed production (number and biomass). Elevation in temperature enhanced seed production of A. retroflexus, but the impact on growth was minor (only difference in plant height in one treatment). The growth and seed production of A. retroflexus in competition with barley was minimal although the growth of barley decreased with the rise in temperature. The results indicate that climate change could improve growth of a C4 weed such as A. retroflexus, but it is unlikely to succeed in spring barley.;",

In this study we monitored the genetic improvements and environmental variability as well as differences among crop species (spring cereals and rapeseed) in YRN in order to characterize changes that have occurred and environmental constraints associated with reducing N leaching into the environment. MTT long-term multi-location field experiments for spring cereals (Hordeum vulgare L., Avena sativa L. and Triticum aestivum L.), turnip rape (Brassica rapa L.), and oilseed rape (B. napus L.) were conducted in 19882008, covering each crops main production regions. Yield (kg ha-1) was recorded and grain/seed nitrogen content (Ngrain, g kg-1) analyzed. Total yield N (Nyield, kg ha-1) was determined and YRN (%) was calculated as a ratio between applied and harvested N. A mixed model was used to separate genetic and environmental effects. Year and location had marked effects on YRN and Nyield. Average early and/or late season precipitation was often most advantageous for Nyield in cereals, while in dry seasons N uptake is likely restricted and in rainy seasons N leaching is often severe. Elevated temperatures during early and/or late growth phases had more consistent, negative impacts on YRN and/or Nyield for all crops, except oilseed rape. In addition to substantial variability caused by the environment, it was evident that genetic improvements in YRN have taken place. Hence, YRN can be improved by cultivar selection and through favouring crops with high YRN such as oat in crop rotations.;",

In this study turbidity and concentration of nitrate-N were monitored with probes in the Savijoki catchment, which has been observed with traditional methods for decades. Particular attention was paid to implementation of the equipment, calibration of the probes and calculation methods. All equipment functioned technically well during the one year monitoring period. Calibration of turbidity and nitrate-N proved that the sampled values agree well with the probe results. However, it seems that loading estimates made with the traditional method are not very reliable for individual years. The research period in this study was exceptional with its many runoff peaks in winter. It is not possible to catch the peaks with traditional monitoring, why the results and comparisons between automatic probes and traditional monitoring cannot be generalized. However, the results proved that novel monitoring techniques have to be continued and extended. In further studies the calculation methods need developed and improved to be to get reliable loading estimations from the sensor data as simply as possible. In a changing climate, the monitoring, loading estimations, and consequently the assessment of the effect of agricultural water protection measures will probably turn even more difficult and challenging.;",

Samples of twelve soils were incubated for three months at room temperature with the applications of KH2P04 in amounts corresponding to 100, 200, or 500 mg P/kg of soil. The results of the fractionation showed that in most samples the applied phosphorus could be found almost completely in the fluoride-soluble and alkali-soluble fractions, the part of the former being the higher and that of the latter the lower the higher the rate of the phosphate application. Similar results were obtained also when the fractionation was performed after the samples had been in contact with the phosphate solutions only for two hours. Analyses of samples from two field trials were in accordance with these results. The soils tended to have a characteristic pattern of phosphate retention which in extreme cases means an almost complete sorption of the applied phosphate either as the fluoride-soluble form or as the alkali-soluble form. In most soils, however, the distribution was more equal. Usually the fluoride-soluble part of the recovered phosphorus tended to be somewhat higher than the alkali-soluble part. This tendency was more distinct in regard to the newly retained phosphorus. The effect of phosphate fertilizers in our soils is discussed on the basis of the results.",

    "abstract": "The food industry faces the problem of soil contamination and consequently the deterioration of the quality of plant products. Here, we present a study on evaluation of the effect of fertilization with sewage sludge (SL) with varying, rates of biochar (BC 2.5, 5 and 10% of DW) on yield quality and the accumulation of heavy metals in wheat grains. The greatest grain yield with the highest content of protein and gluten as well as the highest total content of phenols and flavonoids, was obtained when SL+5%BC fertilization was applied. The addition of 5%BC and 10%BC to SL resulted in the greatest increase in the antioxidant capacity of grain. Among phenolic acids, syringic acid was found in the largest amount in grain in the SL+2.5%BC treatment. A significant decrease in Pb accumulation in wheat grain after application of SL+5%BC and a successive decrease in Al content with increasing BC addition were observed. To increase the quality of wheat grains and to reduce the bioaccumulation of harmful elements after the application of biochar to the soil is important in the context of food safety and health of humans especially in food production on acidic and/or contaminated soils.",

Using the co-application of waste (MS+BD), the highest yield was obtained in the first and second year, but in the third year, a slight decrease in yield was observed compared to NPK. In all years, BD and MS+BD fertilization increased the content of protein, wet gluten, and phenols in wheat grain compared to NPK and no fertilization. Waste fertilization had a positive effect on the antioxidant capacity index of grain but only in the first year. The bioaccumulation index (BAI) demonstrated that NPK decreased BAI for Zn, B, Cd, and Mn, whereas MS+BD decreased BAI for Cu, Sr, Pb, Co, Ba, and Cr.",

    "abstract": "Applying holistic indicators to assess dairy farm efficiency is essential for sustainable milk production. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been instrumental for the calculation of such indicators. However, ‘additive’ DEA models have been rarely used in dairy research. This study presented an additive model known as slacks-based measure (SBM) of efficiency and its advantages over DEA models used in most past dairy studies. First, SBM incorporates undesirable outputs as actual outputs of the production process. Second, it identifies the main production factors causing inefficiency. Third, these factors can be ‘priced’ to estimate the cost of inefficiency. The value of SBM for efficiency analyses was demonstrated with a comparison of four contrasting dairy management systems in terms of technical and environmental efficiency. These systems were part of a multiple-year breeding and feeding systems experiment (two genetic lines: select vs. control; and two feeding strategies: high forage vs. low forage, where the latter involved a higher proportion of concentrated feeds) where detailed data were collected to strict protocols. The select genetic herd was more technically and environmentally efficient than the control herd, regardless of feeding strategy. However, the efficiency performance of the select herd was more volatile from year to year than that of the control herd. Overall, technical and environmental efficiency were strongly and positively correlated, suggesting that when technically efficient, the four systems were also efficient in terms of undesirable output reduction. Detailed data such as those used in this study are increasingly becoming available for commercial herds through precision farming. Therefore, the methods presented in this study are growing in importance.",

In this study we aimed to assess how the switching between spring cereals that differ in earliness was associated with different external factors. This was tested using unique datasets for regional cropping areas and cultivar use for the last 15 years. Early maturing barley was favored at the expense of later maturing wheat when a high number of days to crop maturity was required in the preceding year. In contrast, farmers reduced the barley area when a high number of cumulated degree days was required for a crop to mature in the previous year. A shift was recorded from early to late maturing cultivars. This study indicated that despite limited opportunities for farmers to alter land use, they readily responded to past conditions and used the knowledge gained for decision-making to reduce risk. This is a valuable operative model for studying adaptation to opportunities and constraints induced by climate change.",

The empirical basis was a survey of farmers in Finland. Findings from limited dependent variable regression models suggest that one group of farmers is loyal to the cooperative and opposes its foreign investments. A second and a third group have lower levels of social capital and switch membership status between multiple cooperatives or opt out of cooperatives. These farmers welcome international investment. This finding was more significant for individual farm types than the social capital-linked opposition to internationalisation. A general conclusion is that the internationalization of cooperatives seems affect the members’ trust in the cooperative differently. The increasing heterogeneity within the memberships may give rise to governance problems.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the geographical apple-tree growing location on the accumulation of dominant bioactive compounds in apple fruits: phenolics and triterpenes as the most valuable substances for human health. The study included two apple cultivars, ‘Auksis’ and ‘Ligol’, on B.396 rootstock and was carried out from 2016 to 2018. Geographical apple-tree growing location had a significant impact on the composition and total content of the tested bioactive compounds in apple fruits. Increased accumulation of phenolic and triterpene compounds was recorded in the south–north direction. This could be explained by the different climate conditions in the trial locations: the sum of active temperatures gradually decreased by 200–300 °C in the south–north direction, and the vegetation period becomes shorter. Apples grown in Estonia, depending on the tested cultivar, had 77–139% more total phenolic compounds. Significant differences were recorded for all groups of phenolic compounds. The differences between the trial sites in accumulation of triterpene compounds were lower, although apples in at farthest north location had 18–32% more total triterpene compounds than apples grown in south.",

The addition of a chokeberry juice concentrate to the osmotic solution significantly influenced the increase of polyphenols content in the fruit. Their content was significantly higher in the samples treated via osmotic dehydration in solutions containing the chokeberry juice concentrate, followed by freeze-drying and also by microwave-convective method. The ability to bind DPPH• radicals ranged from 40% in the dried strawberries without osmotic dehydration to 82% in fruit osmo-dehydrated in a mixture of inulin and the chokeberry juice concentrate and dried by freeze-drying. Study results indicate that the concentrated chokeberry juice and inulin can be used as beneficial osmotic substances.

We review mitigation measures and their cost-effectiveness in reducing emissions. Given the multiple sources of agricultural emissions, the literature finds carbon taxes and emissions trading to perform best. The challenges involved in measuring and verifying changes in emissions make the implementation of policies targeting all sources of emissions difficult. Second-best policies addressing a subset of emissions, such as those from ruminants or mineral fertilizers, are more feasible but less efficient. Carbon sequestration in arable soils, while technically promising, faces the problems of heterogeneity in sequestration capacity, measurement, verification and permanence of sequestration. The variation of estimates on emissions reduction, abatement costs and differences in model simulations is large. A better basis for policy designs is needed.",

Peak computer core memory use was 0.67 GB by IOP, 0.80 GB by IM, and 7.53 GB by CHM.

This study tested the effects of composted and lime-stabilised mixed PMS (CPMS and LPMS) on wheat (Triticum aestivum) yields and residual effect on oat (Avena sativa) yields in the boreal region. A two-year field experiment included two CPMS and two LPMS treatments all with additional mineral fertilisation, a mineral fertiliser treatment, and a zero-control treatment. All the fertilisers increased yields. There were no differences in crop yields between CPMS, LPMS and mineral fertiliser treatments. However, some quality characteristics and nitrogen (N) uptake were lower with all or some PMS compared with mineral fertilisation. This result suggests that part of the mineral fertilisation for cereals could be replaced by using PMS, but more information on N mineralisation from sludges is needed.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper some observations upon the occurence of Azotobacter chroococcum in Finnish soils are reported. Without enrichment Azotobacter could be cultivated on the agar plates only from 5 soils out of the 72 samples tested. The enrichment procedure markedly increased the number of soils that gave positive results in the test. Azotobacter could not be found in soils with a pH value lower than 5.8. On the basis of the results it is concluded that Azotobacter probably is present in a large amount of our less acid soils, although generally, in very low numbers. The phosphorus status of the soil exerted some influence upon the development of inoculated Azotobacter in soil plaques. In soil tests the phosphorus requirement of Azotobacter appeared to be markedly higher than that of the crop plants, in general. It was supposed that in some cases this fact could be explained not only on the basis of the phosphorus need of the bacteria but on the basis of the high sensitivity of the organism to the effects of soil aluminium and iron prevented by phosphates. The cultivation of Azotobacter indicum from the soils failed, but Clostridium species could be found in all the samples tested. The increase in the nitrogen content of the mannitol solution cultures during incubation was highest when the soil contained Azotobacter chroococcum. But also in several cultures of soils from which no Azotobacter could be found by the agar plate method, a considerable increase in nitrogen was observed. This was connected with the formation of a thick membrane of fungi and bacteria on the surface of the liquid. The possibility of nitrogen fixation by the associations of soil microorganisms is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The preliminary experiments the results of which are recorded in the present paper, have been carried out in order to obtain some information on the microbiological and chemical mobilization of peat nitrogen at various temperatures. In the incubation experiment at 5°, 20°, 35°, 50°, and 65CC the accumulation of ammonia nitrogen increased with a rising temperature except in the limed series where a minimum was found at 20°. The maximum of nitrate-nitrogen lay at 20 in both the series. The amount of nitrite-nitrogen was almost negligible in all the samples. The mineral nitrogen in the samples incubated at 50° and 65° represented 10—20 % of the total nitrogen. Thus, the organic nitrogen in peat soils can be mobilized to a marked extent, if the conditions are favourable. Accumulation of mineral nitrogen could be stated also at the lower temperatures where the reutilization of released nitrogen in the synthesis of new microbial substance is always more intensive than in the range of thermophilic organisms. Even at 5° a release of nitrogen was noticable. In these experiments liming did not show any beneficial effect upon the accumulation of mineral nitrogen, on the contrary, the values for total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen were lower in the limed series. The nitrate formation was generally somewhat higher in the limed samples than in the corresponding unlimed ones. It was supposed that the considerable increase in the ammonia content of the samples incubated at 50° and 65° was partly due to purely chemical transformations, since the mere heating of moist samples at 75° for two hours brought about a marked accumulation of ammonia nitrogen. The treatment with dry heat was less effective except when the temperature was raised to 200° in which case a carbonization of the peat took place. The losses of organic matter and of total nitrogen due to the heating were almost negligible at the temperatures below 150°. At 150° and at 200°, respectively, about one tenth and one third of the organic matter was burnt up, and the losses of total nitrogen corresponded to approximately one half of the decrease in dry matter. On the basis of the results reported above valid conclusions ought not to be drawn, since the material is too scarce. However, these experiments indicate that reasons for further research exist.",

In theorganic system, lodging is mainly controlled by selecting varieties with increased resistance to lodging, by regulatingsowing density, or by cultivation of varieties of appropriate height. The present study aimed to compare ten varietiestested in the years 2020–2022 in organic trials in terms of plant height and resistance to lodging in two growthphases (milk and harvest). Depending on the analyzed trait, a linear or cumulative link linear mixed model was fittedon plot data. The analyses showed that variety Farmer was the most resistant to lodging in the two growth phases,whereas varieties KWS Vermont and Rubaszek were less resistant to lodging in two growth phases than Farmer,but only at the milk phase, the differences were significant. Furthermore, Radek was the tallest among the testedvarieties, whereas Farmer was classified as mid-tall. According to Wricke’s ecovalence coefficient, Bente was themost stable, while Farmer ranked third. Therefore, varieties that are the most resistant to lodging and are the moststable in terms of height, should be promoted for cultivation.",

Beef production strategies at current annual milk production in Finland (2 200 million kg) were optimised by Excel Solver for each combination of milk yield (8 000, 9 000, 10 000, 11 000, and 12 000 kg year-1) and beef production (60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 100 million kg year-1). Increased milk production intensity decreased total CH4 production at each beef production level. In addition, at the lower levels of beef production than currently (85 million kg) total manure N output decreased with increased intensity of milk production but at current or higher beef production levels the effects of milk yield were small. The current strategy of producing milk and beef with high milk production intensity seems to be effective in terms of CH4 production and N emissions.",

    "abstract": "As global food systems evolve toward sustainability, the demand for plant-based alternatives to traditional animal-derived products is growing. Faba beans (Vicia faba), known for their versatility and agricultural benefits, offer a promising solution in the development of vegan cheese analogues. This study explores the potential of using faba beans to produce a Camembert-like cheese. The Camembert analogues were formulated with fat contents of 15% and 30% and varying proportions of coconut and rapeseed oils in triplicate. The proportions of coconut and rapeseed oils were 40:60, 50:50, and 60:40. Generally, the Camembert analogues with the higher fat content (30%) resulted in higher hardness, springiness, chewiness, and dry matter content compared to the analogues with 15% fat. This suggests that fat content is more important for these parameters than proportions of coconut and rapeseed oil. Future research should focus on optimising texture to more closely replicate traditional dairy Camembert and meet consumer sensory expectations. Incorporating sensory evaluations and consumer feedback is essential to validate instrumental findings and ensure the product meets consumer expectations.",

In laboratory-scale, timothy and meadow fescue mixture was ensiled in 12-litre silos using three compaction methods (normal, loose, and normal followed by additional delayed compaction) and five additive treatments (control, homofermentative inoculant, heterofermentative inoculant, salt-based additive, and formic and propionic acid-based additive). Silage samples from three farms with aerobic stability issues were also analysed. In laboratory scale, chemical preservatives enhanced aerobic stability and minimized fermentation losses more effectively than biological inoculants. Heterofermentative inoculants increased acetic acid production, enhancing stability, while homofermentative inoculants had minimal impact on most parameters. Farm silages exhibited varied quality, with poor microbial quality linked with fast aerobic deterioration. Effective silage management practices, including oxygen limitation, proper compaction, and appropriate preservative application, are crucial to preventing spoilage and ensuring silage quality.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this in vitro batch culture study was to evaluate various agro-industrial by-products as feeds for cattle. In Experiment 1, a basal diet composed of grass silage and barley grain was replaced by additional barley grain, palm kernel cake (PKC), beet molasses (M), wheat bran (WB), or sugar beet pulp (SBP) at two levels of dietary supplementation. In Experiment 2, soybean meal (SBM) was compared with heat-treated rapeseed meal, dried distillers´ grains (DDG), rapeseed cake (RSC), and rapeseed meal (RSM) at two levels of dietary protein concentration in diets based on grass silage supplemented with barley grain or SBP. Propionate and branched chain volatile fatty acids decreased, and CH4 production increased when energy by-products of higher fibre content replaced barley grain. Diets incorporating PKC and WB were less fermentable, while M and SBP did not alter digestibility when replacing barley. Generally, incremental levels of protein in Experiment 2 linearly increased digestibility, utilisable crude protein (uCP), isobutyrate and valerate in vitro. Utilisable crude protein increased for all by-products that replaced SBM, except for RSM in diets including SBP. There was a positive linear effect of by-product level on uCP and valerate, and a negative linear effect for acetate. Diet digestibility was equivalent for DDG and SBM in diets composed with barley as well as SBP. Overall, by-products provided more uCP than diets supplemented with SBM. However, the intestinal digestibility of uCP of the different feeds can vary. In vivo production experiments are needed to fully assess the potential of in vitro evaluated by-products as widely applicable alternative feeds in diets for cattle.",

Unfortunately, the harrowing is partially damaging to crop plants. The objective of the study was to find the optimum timing and intensity (1–3 harrow passes) of weed harrowing in spring barley. A 3-year one-factor field experiment was conducted on the alluvial loamy sand soil. Weed harrowing was conducted at different growth stages of barley. The additional treatments were: the increased seeding rate of barley by 20%; herbicide application and an untreated control. At least two passes with spring-tine harrow: at barley emergence and next at tillering or at the 2-leaf stage and tillering were needed for the significant weed density reduction, but only the first treatment did not reduce barley grain yield. Three harrow passes: at barley emergence, the 2-leaf stage, and tillering most efficiently reduced weed density but were also most damaging to barley. The experiment showed that when planning weed harrowing twice during barley growth, the cereal needs a long period of time to recover after the first cultivation.",

In addition, mass balances of these elements were calculated over 100-year scenarios of P fertilization with a product that was low or high in the assessed elements, a common mineral phosphate fertilizer (MPF), and a hypothetical fertilizer containing the maximum amount of these PTEs allowed by the EU regulations. The examination was performed using case-specific conditions for Finland, Denmark, France, Spain, Hungary, and Germany, in which countries the products had been tested. Although in some individual products the current maximum EU limits were exceeded for Cd and Ni, the contents of the targeted PTEs were overall low in the studied products. The dominant trends in the contents and fluxes of As, Ni, and Pb were decreasing in all fertilizer-use scenarios with observed BBF concentrations, but the maximum allowed rates would instead commonly lead to prominent increases. The highest sensitivity to variation in fertilizer input rates, along with some substantial increases in the environmental contents and fluxes was observed for Cd. However, with low-Cd BBFs, favorable development is also achievable for Cd fluxes. It is recommended that PTE levels remain well below the maximum EU limits.",

A survey was conducted with 400 Finnish respondents, and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships within TPB constructs, including above-mentioned modifications of self-identity and consumption strategies, across different socioeconomic subgroups and the full sample. The findings indicate that attitudes toward farm animal welfare, ethical concerns, and familiarity with animal farming are the strongest predictors of purchasing intentions for welfare-labeled pork. While most respondents expressed a willingness to pay more for AW-labeled products, the role of boycotting emerged as more significant than buycotting, particularly among women and those sharing grocery shopping responsibilities. Social norms and perceived behavioral control showed limited influence in the full sample but were significant for specific groups, such as higher-educated consumers and middle-aged respondents. These results provide valuable insights into consumer motivations, particularly the role of self-identification with ethical concerns, and offer strategic opportunities for marketers and policymakers to promote ethical consumption and strengthen the market potential of welfare-labeled products.",

This study evaluated the effect of adding chestnut hydrolysable tannin (HYT) at ensiling on the chemical composition, protein degradability, and rumen fermentation of grass, whole-crop pea, and bean silages. Forages were harvested, wilted (48 h), chopped (5 cm), and ensiled in mini silos (~25 kg) with one of four treatments: 40 g kg-1 FW HYT (HT), 20 g kg-1 HYT (LT), an inoculant (IN), or water (W, control). Tannin addition reduced (p&lt; 0.01) ammonia-N during ensiling by 31% (HT), 19% (LT), and 7% (IN) compared to W. Tannin treatments decreased (p&lt; 0.01) CNCPS fraction A and increased (p&lt; 0.01) fractions B1, B2, and C, as well as undegradable protein at a 0.05 h⁻¹ outflow rate (HT = 282; LT = 273; IN = 222; W = 216 g kg⁻¹ CP). In-situ degradation showed reductions (p&lt; 0.01) in both the immediately soluble fraction “a” and total degradable fraction “a+b” with tannin inclusion. Gas production was also reduced (p&lt; 0.01) with HT (254 ml) and LT (281 ml) compared to IN (310 ml) and W (337 ml).

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to evaluate the methods for determination of vitamin B6 in foods. To achieve this, the literature review focused on sample treatment and liquid chromatographic analysis of vitamin B6 related compounds. In the experimental part, the chosen sample pretreatment and the high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method were validated, and used to produce vitamin B6 data on various food items commonly consumed in Finland. The main emphasis of the sample treatment was on the extraction efficiency and the maintenance of the original concentration profile of the vitamers. Several acid extraction procedures were tested for this purpose. Perchloric acid was chosen as the extraction agent. Routine food analysis was then performed using dilute ice-cold perchloric acid extraction followed by an internally standardized ion-paired reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Food samples were hydrolyzed with takadiastase and alkaline phosphatase enzymes, phosphorylated and glycosylated vitamers were quantitated before and after the enzymatic digestion. This procedure enabled the extraction of vitamin B6 compounds in their intact forms, and the measurement of free, phosphorylated and glycosylated forms. The maintenance of the concentration profile of the vitamers was verified by using 14C -labeled pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in the examination of the extraction procedure. The extraction efficiency and laboratory performance were confirmed by interlaboratory studies. Up-to-date data on vitamin B6 content of about fifty common food items was produced. The data includes the results from meat and poultry, fish and fish product, dairy product, cereal and vegetable, and ready-to-eat food samples. Free and phosphorylated vitamin B6 compounds were measured in all food groups, and the glycosylated vitamer fraction was analyzed in all plant-derived foods. The results obtained in this work showed that vitamin B6 content of nearly all foods of plant origin was mainly comprised of glycosidically bound pyridoxine derivatives. These bound analytes are normally not taken into account in traditional analytical methods, and food composition tables lack the data of glycosylated pyridoxine. The role of the glycosylated pyridoxines need to be clarified in terms of their analytical and physiological nature. If, as it is currently assumed, the availability of the bound forms is limited for humans, the role of vegetables, cereals and other foods of plant origin as a source of vitamin B6, as well as the analytical methods should be reassessed.;",

The isolates tested were clustered into two main groups and further into several subgroups by UP-PCR profiles and phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenetic relationships of these groups are discussed. No clear correlation was found between the groups and host plant preference or the geographic origin of F. avenaceum isolates. Pathogenicity tests showed differences between F. avenaceum isolates, but two isolates, one from wheat and the other from barley, were the most aggressive in wheat and barley. This fungus, usually known as a weak pathogen of cereals and other crops, has thus probably not evolved in respect to its ability to damage wheat or barley.",

Current address: MTT Agrifood Research Finland, Plant Production Research, FIN-31600 Jokioinen, Finland. e-mail: pirjo.peltonen-sainio@mtt.fi Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are not usually applied to oat (Avena sativa L.) crops. This study was designed to test whether the antigibberellin chlormequat chloride (CCC) and ethylene-releasing ethephon sprayed on to oat foliage represent potential agents for manipulation of yield formation under northern growing conditions. Effects of these PGRs on yield components and tiller growth and productivity were examined in detail. This study included a long-strawed landrace, a modern standard height cultivar, two naked (A. sativa ssp. nuda L.) and two dwarf oats. Field experiments were conducted at Viikki Experimental Farm, University of Helsinki, in 1995 and 1996. Chlormequat chloride was sprayed at the two-node stage and ethephon when the flag leaf ligule was just visible on the main shoot. Various traits characterizing growth and yield formation were assessed. Chlormequat chloride increased grain yield by 0% to 13% depending on cultivar and year, while ethephon most often decreased it by up to 17%. No lodging occurred and the recorded increase in grain yield of CCC treated plants was not therefore due to prevention of lodging. However, CCC treatment resulted in more panicles per square meter and in 1995 tillers contributed more to grain yield. Ethephon treated plants had less grains per main shoot panicle, lower panicle filling rate (PFR) and parallel decreased harvest index (HI). Stem elongation of dwarf oat was enhanced by CCC, in contrast to that of conventional and naked cultivars.;",

Research approaches for agricultural crops have evolved from observations on winter and frost damage to studies on molecular mechanisms of cold acclimation and freezing injury. The results of experiments on survival of winter cereals, grasses and clovers and frost tolerance of potato and turnip rape are discussed. The studies conducted on horticultural crops, including apple, strawberry, raspberry, currants, blueberry, sea buckthorn, perennial herbs as well as on ornamental trees and shrubs have included field evaluations of cultivars, or selections for winter hardiness, and studies on the effects of cultural management practices on winter survival. During the last decade detailed studies including controlled freezing tests have provided tools to assist in explanation of the underlying mechanisms of cold hardiness also in horticultural plants. ;",

In Finland, undersowing is a suitable method for establishing cover crops in cereal cropping. The effect of annual undersowing on cereal grain yield and soil mineral N content in spring was studied at two sites. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), a mixture of red clover and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), and westerwold ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. var. westerwoldicum) were undersown in spring cereals in the same plots in six successive seasons, and their effects on cereal yield were estimated. Annual undersowing with clovers increased, and undersowing with westerwold ryegrass decreased cereal grain yields. The grain yield was only slightly lower with a mixture of red clover and meadow fescue than with red clover alone. Westerwold ryegrass did not affect soil mineral N content in spring and the increase attributable to clovers was small. The mixture of red clover and meadow fescue affected similarly to pure red clover. Soil fertility was not notably improved during six years of undersowing according to grain yield two years later.",

    "abstract": "Although atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) has been up to 16-fold higher than at present, the past several million years have seen atypically low values. Thus, modern-day plants are adapted to cope with a low [CO2]/[O2] ratio. The present [CO2] does not saturate C3 photosynthesis, so its doubling produces an “efficiency effect”, but it is not always fully realized. Acclimation to high [CO2] during growth can down-regulate photosynthesis, presumably to optimize carbon acquisition and utilization. A primary factor in acclimation is a reduction in rubisco. Two crops, rice and soybean, were used to study this phenomenon. Rice photosynthesis and growth peaked at 500 μmol mol-1 , whereas soybean responded up to 990 μmol mol-1 . Rubisco concentration declined under CO2-enrichment and increasing temperatures, more so in rice than soybean. The rubisco kcat of rice was unaffected by growth [CO2] or temperature, but that from soybean was increased by both. In rice the capacity to handle carbohydrate, as measured by sucrose phosphate synthase activity was up-regulated by CO2 -enrichment, but not by temperature. Leaf carbohydrates were increased by [CO2], but decreased by higher temperatures, starch more so than sucrose. Even though C3 species differ in response to [CO2] and temperature, CO2 -enrichment can moderate adverse effects of temperature extremes.",

The average proportion of land in agricultural use in the sample area was 17.4%. The arable area declined from the maximum of 62.3 ha (1959) to 47.6 ha. The total length of linear landscape elements, predominantly ditch bank habitats, halved, from 876 m/ha of field (1944) to 449 m/ha by the end of the period. The average rate of loss of field boundary habitat was 9.1 m/ha/ year. At the same time, the Shannon-Weaver index of diversity of agricultural landscape elements dropped from 0.37 to 0.24. The number of field parcels declined by 29%, and the mean parcel size increased by 45%, from 1.2 ha to 1.7 ha. The index value of the fractal dimension measuring the complexity of parcel shapes also fell, from 1.88 (1959) to 1.86 (1991). The change in spatial structure reflects the intensification of farming in Finland. Biodiversity at ecosystem level has clearly declined.

Inorganic Se group males received 0.2 mg inorganic Se + 30 mg vitamin E, those of organic Se group 0.2 mg organic Se + 60 mg vitamin E in 1 kg of the diet ration. The experiment was performed in two seasons: I - June-September, II - January-April. On day 180 of life (close of the test), the boars were subjected to live evaluation: testes volume, libido level, semen characteristics as well as Se content and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in seminal plasma and blood serum. The boars of group inorganic Se obtained higher (P = 0.01) selection index of live evaluation than those of the group organic Se. The boars of group organic Se were characterized by better libido level, higher (P = 0.05) concentration and total number of spermatozoa in an ejaculation, lower (P = 0.01) percentage of semen with morphological changes and higher (P = 0.01) value of osmotic resistance test of acrosome membranes in spite of the fact that GSH-Px activity in seminal plasma was lower when compared with those of the group inorganic Se. The findings show that organic Se + vitamin E has been of a more favourable influence on reproductive performance of young boars than that of inorganic Se + vitamin E. More favourable influence of organic Se + vitamin E was observed in winter-spring season than in summer.",

    "abstract": "The influence of different fertilization practices on the growth, yield and inner quality of carrot (Daucus carota L.) was studied. The field experiments were carried out in Southern Finland, on the experimental farm of Kemira Oy, in 1985 and 1986. Unirrigated and irrigated placement and broadcast fertilization, NPK fertirrigations without or with basic fertilization, and PK placement with N fertirrigations were compared. Placement and broadcast fertilizations were carried out by single application, whereas NPK or N fertirrigations were performed as split applications. The highest yields were obtained when the total phytomass production was high. The yield increased by the placement of NPK fertilizer as compared to broadcast fertilization, and by the placement of P and K as compared to treatments where P and K were broadcasted or fertirrigated. The PK placement with N fertirrigations increased the root dry matter content as compared to NPK fertirrigations. The lowest NO3-N contents of roots were obtained by unirrigated placement fertilization. NPK fertirrigations caused higher root NO3-N contents than any other fertilization practice, and irrigation as such increased the NO3-N contents. Root N and P contents were increased by placement of PK or NPK fertilizers, but fertilization practices had no effects on K, Mg and Ca contents. Single application increased ash and dietary fibre contents as compared to split applications. In conclusion, the placement of NPK or PK fertilizers had positive effects on the above mentioned quality criteria and yield, and thus in future research and in commercial vegetable production these fertilization practices should be utilized. Fertilization practices had no or only slight effects on the carotene and sugar contents, taste, texture and the quality of stored carrots. Carotene content increased as the growing season progressed, and was 41 % higher in the climatically more favourable year 1986 than in 1985. Total sugar contents were higher in the climatically less favourable year 1985 and in unfertilized treatments than in 1986 and in fertilized treatments. It was hypothesized that carrot sugar contents are related to growth and total phytomass production. The indicative results showed that the NPK fertirrigations without basic fertilization had a slight positive effect on carrot taste and texture as compared to placement fertilization but, on the other hand, the NPK fertirrigations without basic fertilization showed a tendency to impair the storage ability as compared to single application. In conclusion, carotene and sugar contents are strongly influenced by genotype and climate and thus it is logical that the effects of fertilization practices remained slight. The results of carrot taste do not allow any final conclusions to be drawn; further investigation on the subject is needed.",

    "abstract": "This article deals with the results achieved in the breeding of six-row barley at Hankkija Plant Breeding Institute since the beginning of scientific barley breeding in the 1910s, with special reference to earliness and genetic origin of the varieties. In Finland, barley is grown in the northern border of plant production up to the 67th parallel. Through centuries it has been an important cereal but a rapid expansion in the acreage occurred only in the mid-1970s. Today the acreage of barley is close to 700,000 hectares. Most of the crop is used for feed, the rest for malting. Adaptation to Finnish conditions, with a short growing season and acid soils, has always been the major aim inbreeding. The genetic basis for the beginning of barley breeding was locally adapted landraces which had reached Finland from east and west. The landraces showed extensive genetic variations. Through selection, a total of eight varieties three four-row, one six-row and four two-row varieties were developed. The most important was the extremely early variety Olli which has been an important variety not only in Finland but also in Canada. After the variation of landraces was fully utilized, the positive characteristics of different varieties were combined by crossings. A total of eight six-row varieties have been developed since Olli. These varieties are presented in brief. It is worth noticing that all the varieties are nearly totally of Scandinavian origin. The extremely early variety Olli is included in the pedigree of all the eight varieties released since Olli (1927). The percentage of wide crosses is minimal. However, in spite of the narrow gene pool, breeding work has produced several successful varieties which have covered are markable proportion of the total barley acreage. This may be a result of good adaptation of landraces and the first cultivars to the extreme weather and soil conditions prevailing in Finland. Furthermore, although the earliness of landraces or Olli has not been exceeded, improvements in other characteristics, e.g. yielding potential, straw stiffness and malting quality, have considerably contributed to the production of Finnish barley.",

    "abstract": "The effects of nitrogen fertilization on the yield and quality of early potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) were studied at MTT Agrifood Research Finland during 19961997. Cultivars were harvested at three times. The experimental layout was a split-split-plot with harvest times as main plots and nitrogen fertilization and potato cultivars as the subplots. The fertilizer treatments were 60 and 120 kg N ha-1 and the cultivars tested were Timo, Gloria and Van Gogh. The harvest times were 5762, 7075 and 8590 days after planting. Application of 120 kg N ha-1 intensifi ed canopy development and increased leaf area of the stands. At early harvest the tuber yield of all cultivars receiving the higher nitrogen application increased by 0.52.5 t ha-1. The highest yielding cultivar was Timo. At last harvest, the higher nitrogen treatment increased yield by 3.06.2 t ha-1. The highest yielding cultivars were Timo and Van Gogh. The dry matter content of tubers was very low, 13.817.2%, at the fi rst harvest and the higher nitrogen application reduced dry matter content by 0.31.0%. The highest fertilizer application rate resulted in the largest tuber size. Nitrogen application, however, affected the quality of potatoes by decreasing the dry matter content. The nitrate content in tubers increased signifi cantly with the increasing level of nitrogen. The range of nitrate content in tubers fl uctuated between 13 and 189 mg kg-1 fresh weight showing good controlling of nitrate values. Harvest time affected sucrose content and the reducing sugar content in tubers, but nitrogen fertilizer did not change the sugar content of tubers. As tuber yield and quality during a short growing season are affected mainly by intercepted radiation, methods to increase tuber yield should focus on reducing the time to emergence, improving haulm growth after emergence and increasing the harvest index.;",

Consequently, the extent of the acidification problem is likely to have varied over time in response to the type and extent of contemporary land use. In this study, we have combined historical information on land use and knowledge on hydrogeochemical processes in order to assess the pH declines that are likely to have occurred in streams in this area since the Middle Ages. The results show that among several potentially acidifying activities, reclamation of mires for farmland (19th and 20th centuries) and subsurface drainage of acid sulphate soils (post-war times) are the major causes of the pH decline. Recent methods developed to combat the acidification and possible future changes in pH are discussed.;",

The objective of this paper was to study the effect of the introduction of robotic milking in Finland on the composition and hygienic quality of milk. The study was carried out on three farms which were the first in Finland to introduce the automatic milking system (Volontary Milking System). Main chemical composition, somatic cell count, total bacteria count, freezing point, free fatty acids, as well as Bacillus cereus, Clostridium spores, psychrotrophic bacteria and coliforms were determined. After the introduction of the automatic milking system an increase in somatic cell count and total bacteria count, psychrotrophic bacteria and coliforms was observed; however, the differences were not statistically significant. The counts for Clostridium spores were at the same level in the automatic and the conventional milking system. Bacillus cereus counts were very low in both milking systems studied. Milk fat content and free fatty acids were elevated when AMS was introduced. The introduction of AMS resulted in a significant increase (P &lt; 0.01) in the freezing point during the first three months. Though there was a trend that the overall quality of milk was impaired after the introduction of AMS, the quality of milk remained at premium class.;",

Two experiments were conducted with wilted timothy-meadow fescue herbage (dry matter 429 and 344 g kg-1) using six treatments. In experiment I, E76 (106 cfu g-1 fresh matter (FM)) was applied alone and in combination with sodium benzoate (0.3 g kg-1 grass FM) or low rate of formic acid (0.4 l t-1 FM). In experiment II, E76 and a commercial inoculant were applied alone and in combination with sodium benzoate. Untreated silage and formic acid (4 l t-1 FM) treated silage served as negative and positive controls in both experiments. The effect of sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate in experiment I, on aerobic stability was tested by treating silages prior to aerobic stability measurements. The novel lactic acid bacteria inoculant was equally effective in improving fermentation quality as the commercial inoculant. However, the aerobic stability of both inoculated silages was poorer than that of formic acid treated or the untreated one in one of the experiments. The results suggested that antimicrobial properties of E76 were not effective enough to improve aerobic instability. One option to overcome this problem is to use chemical additives in combination with the inoculants.;",

Herbage Ca and Na contents varied between the seed mixtures, Ca, Mg, P and Na contents between the years and all measured minerals, except Na, between the grazing periods. The white clover mixture resulted in higher Ca and Na contents. The contents of Ca and Mg were positively related with the proportions of clovers and weeds and were higher in 1997. The contents of P and K were higher in the rainy summer of 1998. The seed mixtures resulted in similar mean K/(Ca + Mg) equivalent ratios, but the Ca/P ratio was higher for the white clover mixture. Mineral rations varied between and within grazing seasons. Under organic practices the supply of minerals in the pasture herbage varied temporally and according to the botanical contents and was unable to meet fully the requirements of dairy cows.

Yield results of some earlier field studies were also used in calibrating the soil test P values determined by the Finnish acid ammonium acetate method (PAc). Significant yield responses to P fertilisation were obtained on soils which had low PAc values or medium levels of PAc and too low or too high pH values (&lt; 6.0 or 7.5 in water suspension). The mean relative control yield (RCY, yield without applied P divided by yield with sufficient P multiplied by 100) of the eight sites was 94.6% (n = 128, mean PAc 15.5 mg dm-3) varying from 87% at PAc 2.8 mg dm-3 to 100% at high PAc. A PAc level of 5-7 mg dm-3 was adequate for cereals, grasses and oilseed rape on the basis of the RCY value of 95% at optimal pH. At this PAc replacing the amounts of P in the crops (14 kg in 4 t grain) and the fixation of extractable P (about 6 kg ha-1 a-1) produced almost maximum yields in favourable seasons and were considered optimal.;",

The feeding experiment comprised 20 Finnish Ayrshire bulls and 12 Holstein-Friesian bulls, and four treatments (8 bulls per treatment). There were four diets with two offered at stage 1 (from the initiation of the study to 450 kg live weight) and four at stage 2 (from 450 kg live weight to slaughter). The control diet (BF0) included grass silage (460 g kg1 dry matter) and barley grain (540), BF25 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (405) and BF (135), BF50 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (270) and BF (270), and BF75 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (135) and BF (405). At stage 1 there were only two treatments (BF0 and BF50) and at stage 2, all four treatments were included. All bulls were fed total mixed ration ad libitum. The mean initial live weight of the bulls was 261 kg and the mean final live weight 650 kg. At stage 1 there were no significant treatment differences in dry matter, energy or protein intakes or in live weight gain. At stage 2, replacing barley grain with BF led to a linear decrease of daily live weight gain (P &lt; 0.05) and a linearly reduced feed conversion (kg dry matter kg1 live weight gain) (P &lt; 0.05). The apparent digestibility of the organic matter and neutral detergent fibre decreased linearly with increasing BF supplementation (P &lt; 0.001). The dressing proportion and the carcass fat score decreased linearly (P &lt; 0.05) with partial replacement of barley grain with BF. On carcass conformation, treatment had a significant (P &lt; 0.05) quadratic effect: the BF25 and BF50 diets were classified highest. The results indicate that 50% of barley starch can be replaced with BF without affecting growth, but feed efficiency factors may decrease when barley starch is replaced with BF. At 75% replacement, feed intake was reduced, which resulted in a lower energy intake and reduced level of performance.;",

Based on their occurrence in different climate zones, the risk of naturalization of new harmful alien weed species was deemed low for those species not currently found in Finland, but higher for species occurring as casual aliens in Finland. In the latter group, 10 species of concern were detected. Exploration of the distribution patterns of naturalized species within Finland revealed species occupancy to be dependent on the residence time of the species.

For the more resistant genotype, fungicide application had relatively low returns because of the much higher level of biological resistance and small disease-related yield reductions.

A geostatistical method, model-based kriging, was used to determine the spatial variation in yield, clover content and BNF of clover-grass leys as well as soil chemical properties throughout two fields in 2004-2006. Based on this variation, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the similar patterns of variation. On one location, total dry matter yields of the leys decreased over three production years from 9 700 to 4 100 kg ha-1, clover content from 53 to 26% and BNF from 150 to 40 kg N ha-1, whereas on the other location the yields increased from 6 500 to 7 100 kg ha-1, clover content from 52 to 62% and BNF from 100 to 120 kg N ha-1. Nutrient concentrations in soil also varied greatly within the fields, although this depended on the nutrient species. Kriging combined with PCA described the spatial variation of ley parameters very informatively, but was not as powerful for describing the pattern of nutrients. Based on the spatial dependence determined in the two fields investigated, it seems that the sampling distance should be 80 m for soil nutrients, 100 m for yield and 60 m for clover content and BNF determination, respectively.;",

    "abstract": "The development of the yield and nutritive value of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) both in the primary growth and in the regrowth were studied at MTT Plant Production Research, a unit of MTT Agrifood Research Finland, in Rovaniemi (66°35´N) in 19992001. The dry matter yield and leaf:stem ratio were measured from the crop samples, and the contents of crude protein and organic matter digestibility of both whole plant samples and leaf and stem fractions were analysed. In primary growth, the most rapid increase of dry matter, 220240 kg ha-1 per day, was measured around the beginning of the heading stage. There was a very strong positive correlation between the proportion of stems and the amount of dry matter in the primary yield. The daily growth rate of the regrowth was less than half of that of the primary growth. The fastest decrease, 1 percentage unit per day, in crude protein content was measured at the pasture stage (45-leaf stage). During the entire sampling period, the average daily decline in crude protein content in the primary growth of timothy was 0.65 percentage units. The main cause for the rapid decline in crude protein content was the high proportion of stem matter and its low protein content. In the regrowth, during the last four weeks before the harvest, the average daily decline in crude protein content was 0.28 percentage units.The average decline in organic matter digestibility from early pasture stage to late silage stage was 0.9 percentage units per day. The most remarkable change was noticed at the growth stage of timothy when about the half of stems were heading and it was then that the digestibility decreased by more than one percentage unit per day. The rapid decline in organic matter digestibility was due to the low digestibility of stem matter. The daily change in forage digestibility in the regrowth was very small, on average 0.11%.;",

In severely S deficient plants (0.05 mM), Se acted as a toxic element, alfalfa was the most susceptible plant that died at this treatment. However, in plants supplied with near adequate (0.5 mM) or adequate (1.0 mM) S, Se acted as a growth promoting element. The most pronounced stimulation of growth was observed in cabbage and the lowest in alfalfa. Increasing S concentration in the medium, reduced Se uptake and transport. In contrast, S uptake and transport increased in response to Se addition. Se volatilization was higher in alfalfa than cabbage and kohlrabi when expressed on unit shoot dry weight or leaf area basis, but not when expressed per plant. Results suggested that Se supplementation of plants supplied with adequate S, not only had beneficial effects on plants growth but also can have application in enrichment of livestock fodder and human food.;",

Averaged over one-, two-, and three-year-old leys the accumulated first and second cuts produced 7.12 t dry matter herbage ha-1 year-1, with a clover proportion of 34.8%. Herbage production declined with increasing ley age. The average proportion of clover increased from 26.4% in the first to 43.7% in the second cut but decreased with ley age. Within- and between-field variations of clover proportions markedly decreased from the first to the second cut and strongly increased with ley age, while changes in the variations of herbage production were less pronounced. Within-field variations of clover proportions in the first and in the second cuts were higher at lower proportions of clover. Herbage production was positively related with clover proportion. Soil properties had a major impact on clover proportion and herbage production, largely explaining also regional differences in ley growth. Amelioration of fields and, not at least, of less fertile sites within the same field seems to be a crucial requirement for higher and more even clover proportions and herbage yields.;",

The decreases in plant weight and total yield of the weeds were very steep when the cereal seed rate was raised from 25 to 200 kg/ha. Increases in the seeding rate reduced the total yields of weeds rather than their numbers. The effect of the cereal on weeds became apparent as soon as heading of the cereal was complete and was further enhanced by prolonged competition. Added nitrogen raised the weed yields at cereal seed rates of 25—100 kg/ha but reduced them at higher seed rates. Nitrogen also raised the yield and individual plant weight of C. album. Cereal seed rate did not affect the nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium contents of the weeds grown among the crop. Due to larger total weed yields, however, the amounts of these nutrients in the weeds were higher in sparse than in dense cereal populations.",

    "abstract": "The placement of fertilizer was studied in the field trial on a clay soil in Southern Finland. The placement of fertilizer in the depth of 8 cm gave 28 per cent greater grain yield of spring wheat, and the placement in the depth of 12 cm 26 per cent greater grain yield than the surface dressing. The growth of shoots on the soil receiving placement was much better than on the soil receiving surface dressing. The results of shoot analyses showed that the placement caused a much greater uptake of nutrients than the surface dressing. The uptake of nitrogen was relatively most increased by the placement, somewhat less that of potassium and least that of phosphorus. The ripening of wheat was speeded up by the placement, which probably was due to the better early uptake of nitrogen and to the better uptake of phosphorus by means of the placing. The superiority of the placement to the surface dressing could be explained by the distribution of nutrients in the experimental soil during the dry early part of the growth season. A great deal of fertilizer nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium remained near the surface of the soil receiving surface dressing, and plants were not able to take up nutrients from the dry surface layer. On the contrary, the placed nutrients were deeper, in moister soil and better within the reach of wheat roots. Any movement of ammonium nitrogen was not found by the used methods. Nitrate nitrogen appeared to move to a greater extent particularly in the irrigated plots.",

The estimating equations are standardized and simplified so that they provide information for designing tradable contracts. A simple basket of weather indices, consisting of growing degree days, night frost and rainfall measures, has the potential to hedge about 38% of the wheat grower yield risk, with the remaining 62% being left as uninsured basis risk. Our results have several important implications for the design of simple and tractable weather index-based insurance contracts. The data suggest that the marginal products of weather events have a large variation across time and they are the most significant within certain critical time periods. Therefore, the weather events triggering the indemnity payments should be bounded within certain critical time regimes over their distribution along the growing season.;",

Plant height, leaf area index (LAI), SPAD-value, biomass yield, ash content and mineral element composition were determined. Mean aboveground biomass yields were not significantly affected by N source (legume intercrops and synthetic fertilizer) and ranged from 13 to 17 t ha-1. Remarkably, plants given no fertilizer yielded equally to plants given 90 N kg ha-1. These results confirm that Jerusalem artichoke, compared to other energy crops, have less need for N and can potentially be sustained by N fixing legumes in an intercropped system. This could reduce or eliminate production and environmental cost in cultivation of biomass feedstock for energy use.",

The effect of drought stress on the nutritive value was considerable less pronounced than the influence on DMY. No significant influence of water deficit on crude protein, crude fibre and crude ash contents was found, but only on water-soluble carbohydrate and crude fat content in one year of the study. It was found, that under drought stress T. pratense is more suitable for cultivation in the mixture with F. braunii than in pure stand, due to a lower reduction of DMY and no adverse effect of water deficiency on yield quality.",

A set of financial ratios formed an aggregated indicator reflecting the complexity of relationships between the level and structure of current assets and liabilities of a firm. Based on the proposed indicator, four types of strategies for working capital management were identified and characterized in terms of risk and return preferences. Only a few companies from the sample demonstrated a direct orientation on liquidity or value within their strategies for working capital management. To retain flexibility in short-term financial management, most firms applied moderate policies for current assets and liabilities that helped them in maintaining liquidity and reducing the cost of financing. The integrity of the proposed method for the synthetic evaluation of working capital management makes it a convenient managerial tool suitable for use in firms operating in a turbulent business environment.",

In the more intensively podsolized virgin soils the surface layers, particularly the A2-horizon, are very poor in all the forms of inorganic phosphorus while the enrichment layer will contain fairly high amounts of iron and aluminium bound phosphorus. The application of fertilizers and the other cultivation managements tend to accumulate aluminium and iron bound phosphorus in the plough layer. In some soils the minimum content of calcium bound phosphorus occurs in the layer below the plough layer, but an increase with the depth seems to be typical to it in all the non-Litorina soils, while the first two fractions usually decrease with the depth. In the Litorina soils the iron bound phosphorus is dominant in all the layers studied, but the content of reductant soluble phosphorus is low in these soils, and their content of calcium bound phosphorus is higher than the content of phosphorus bound by aluminium. The predominance of calcium phosphate in the subsoil and the rather low content of reductant soluble and occluded fractions indicate that the chemical weathering in most of our soils is not yet at an advanced stage. The test values determined were in accordance with the results of the fractionation and the estimation of ammonium oxalate soluble aluminium and iron.",

    "abstract": "In the present work an attempt was made to follow in laboratory experiments the distribution of fertilizer phosphorus into the various fractions of soil inorganic phosphorus using the procedure of CHANG and JACKSON (3). Four mineral soils were selected for these studies. Their acidity varied from pH 3.7 to pH 6.0 (in 0.02 N CaCl2), clay content from 28 to 54 per cent, and the indicator of their capacity to sorb phosphate from 135 to 1000. The fertilizers studied were superphosphate, CaHPO4∙2H20 (chemical grade), hyperphosphate, basic slag, and a preparate of fused apatite called in this work the »Finnish phosphate». In the soil samples incubated with an application of fertilizers corresponding to about 500 ppm P for 24 weeks at room temperature, the fertilizer phosphorus accumulated in various fractions mainly according to the properties of the soils. In the two acid Litorina soils rich in sesquioxides and with a high capacity to sorb phosphate, the main part of the fertilizer phosphorus was found in the alkali-soluble fraction in most the cases, with a not insignificant amount in the fluoride-soluble fraction. The only exceptions occurred in the distribution of hyperphosphate phosphorus, and to a lesser degree, of phosphorus in basic slag, in the sample particularly rich in iron where a large portion of fertilizer phosphorus remained in the acid-soluble forms. In the slightly acid sandy clay the distribution of the fertilizer phosphorus into the different fractions was more uniform than in the other soils, only the hyperphosphate phosphorus largely remained in the acid-soluble forms. In the acid silt soil with a typical average capacity to sorb phosphate, the main part of the fertilizer phosphorus was in all cases found in the fluoride-soluble fraction. The equal distribution of superphosphate phosphorus and dicalcium phosphate phosphorus in the respective incubated soils is in accordance with the claim that monocalcium phosphate rapidly turns over into dicalcium phosphate in the soil. The well known slow mobilization of hyperphosphate phosphorus in all but the very acid soils is also demonstrated by the present results, but the slow reaction of this fertilizer in the acid soil with a very high content of iron may be worth of further studies. The compounds of basic slag seem to be mobilized fairly rapidly even in the less acid soils. The results concerning the »Finnish phosphate» indicate that this preparate may be a valuable phosphorus fertilizer in various kinds of our soils. During the fractionation procedure the reactions of the fertilizer phosphorus compounds with the soil constituents seem to be marked, the trend and the rate of the reactions largely depending on the properties of the soils.",

In the points of growth of the Sphagnum mosses colloidal acids saturated with hydrogen ions, so-called acidoids, are continuosly formed. They produce an electrical potential difference between the moss and its growth base. The potential difference with reference to the growth base increases from the boundary surfaces between moss and peat towards the points of growth. This potential difference forces the base cations to pass over from the peat into the moss plant in the direction of the potential and at a rate controlled by it. In the investigation this potential difference has been determined experimentally with the aid of NERNST’s formula.",

    "abstract": "A statistical study of the effects of the feeding of large amounts of calcium and phosphorus supplements on the level of these minerals in the blood of dairy cows was made on the basis of 274 blood samples collected from 15 herds. The effects of four presumably independent variables, the actual amount of either calcium or phosphorus in the ration, milk yield, stage of lactation and the Ca/P ratio of the ration, were investigated simultaneously. When the level of calcium in the blood (x1) was considered as the dependent variable, it showed a possibly significant correlation only to two of the above mentioned independent variables, e.g., to Ca/P ratio (x2) and milk yield (x3). The coefficients of partial correlation obtained were r12,3 = + 0.3766 and r13,2 = + 0.1545 and that of multiple correlation r1(23) = 0.3966. These correlations can be expressed quantitatively with the following equation: x1 = 4.88 + 0.427 · x2 + 0.0373 · x3, where x1 = the amount of calcium in blood in mg. per 100 ml, x2 = the Ca/P ratio of the ration and x3 = kilograms of milk produced per day. When the effect on the level of inorganic phosphorus in mg. per 100 ml. of blood (x1) was investigated similarly, again only two of the variables studied, e.g., the actual amount of phosphorus (g. per day) in the ration (x2) and the milk yield (x3) appeared to be effective. The coefficients of partial and multiple correlations obtained were r12,3 = + 0.4861, r13,2 = - 0.1447 and r1(23) = 0.4892. This effect expressed as a linear function, is given by the following equation: x1 = 3.59 + 0.0142 · x2 - 0.0304 · x3. When the cations Na+, K+,and Ca++, and the anions CL- and HPO4-- were determined separately in the blood, the total amount of cations expressed in chemical equivalents exceeded the total equivalent amount of inorganic anions to an amount that was about twice the equivalent amount of the bicarbonate alkali reserve of the blood. The total cation excess varied independenly of the Ca/P ratio of the ration, but the latter showed a negative correlation to the bicarbonate alkali reserve, probably due to an increasing amount of organic acids in the blood. No effect on the pH of either blood of feces was noticed. It is concluded that an excessive amount of phosphate may be conducive to maintaining a high blood inorganic phosphate level. Similarly, a high Ca/P ratio of the ration or an excessive amount of calcium carbonate in the feed, along with proper rumen fermentation, may be conducive to maintaining a high calcium content in the blood of high producing dairy cows.",

    "abstract": "Red clover is typically produced as a mixed stand with grasses, which may lead to suboptimal fertilization and harvest time practices, resulting in poor survival of red clover. Further, unknown proportions of red clover in mixed swards complicate ration formulation for livestock. Thus, producing red clover as pure stands could offer benefits, but it may be difficult to ensile. The objective of the current study was to evaluate major management possibilities such as wilting, inclusion of timothy grass and different types of additives in optimizing the ensilage of red clover. Low DM silages were poorly preserved with high pH, elevated acetic acid concentrations and proportions of ammonia-N in total N, as well as depleted water-soluble carbohydrate levels. Moderate wilting clearly improved the fermentation quality of silages. Further, the use of formic acid-based additives improved the fermentation quality of the silages, the effect being more pronounced in the low than medium dry matter silages. The composition of red clover and timothy were rather similar regarding dry matter content and ensilability. This was probably the reason why clear benefits in silage quality from timothy inclusion could not be demonstrated.",

Chickweed (Stellaria media), an adaptive and competitive annual weed, poses a significant agricultural threat due to its low and dense canopy. This study aimed to evaluate the level of resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors in chickweed populations in Estonia and identify potential mechanisms. In the initial dose-response experiment, a biotype from Järva County exhibited resistance to the ALS inhibitor tribenuron-methyl. Molecular analysis identified a mutation at position 574 in the ALS gene, where tryptophan was replaced by leucine. Testing of eight chickweed biotypes for resistance to tribenuron-methyl and the combination herbicide iodosulfuron + amidosulfuron found three resistant biotypes. The Järva County biotype was cross-resistant to sulfonylureas, while two others exhibited resistance only to iodosulfuron + amidosulfuron. The latter two biotypes lacked the ALS gene mutation, suggesting non-target-site resistance mechanisms, although these were not investigated further. These findings highlight the potential for widespread herbicide resistance in Estonia and emphasize the need for more comprehensive monitoring and research into resistance mechanisms.",

We estimated changes in the metal content of the following crops: wheat, barley, oat, rye, potato, carrot, sunflower seed, and maize following 100-year scenarios of fertilization with the different products. To estimate changes in chronic dietary exposure to metals via food, we used available national data of food consumption and metal content in target crops. Our results showed low changes to current chronic dietary exposure after using BBFs. Exceedance of the maximum allowed levels of Cd and Pb in food (EU 2023/915) was more rare with low-Cd BBF than with SP mineral fertilizer. Only the BBFH slightly increased the dietary exposure to Cd, although similarly to SP. In conclusion, the studied BBFs did not increase dietary exposure to heavy metals, especially compared with the use of conventional SP mineral fertiliser.",

In this study, we developed a method to define a critical threshold value for SOC/clay ratio on the basis of crop productivity and resilience. The study integrated data from national soil monitoring (NSM) of Finnish cropland soils (n=505) with satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from the EcoDataCube (EDC) portal. The study area was confined to the boreal environmental zone to ensure consistent pedo-climatic conditions. The results show that the interannual variation in crop productivity increases rapidly below SOC/clay ratio of 0.09 (95% confidence intervals ranging from 0.07 to 0.16), whereas the corresponding threshold for mean productivity was 0.13 (0.09–0.16). The observed threshold values were found applicable for both cereals and temporary ley. The SOC/clay ratio of 1:13 (=0.08), regarded as a criterion for healthy soil in the current Soil Monitoring Law proposal, based on studies by Johannes et al. (2017) and Prout et al. (2021), is lower than the mean thresholds estimated in this study but aligns close to the lower bound of the 95% confidence intervals. In this research, Finnish agricultural land served as the case study area, but the method is easily applicable to various pedo-climatic regions and potentially to different land use types.",

We reviewed changes in the status of agricultural and horticultural pests that were identified in 2011 as potential future threats to Finnish plant production and identified species that were not mentioned in the previous review but are considered emergent pests now. In field crops, the emergent weed species were Echinochloa crus-galli and Solanum nitidibaccatum, the emergent plant pathogens Zymoseptoria tritici, Fusarium graminearum and F. langsethiae and rusts (Puccinia spp.) in cereals, as well as Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) and emerging species of potato blackleg bacteria (Dickeya and Pectobacterium spp.). The migrant Lepidopteran, Autographa gamma, the established alien sawfly Athalia rosae in oilseed crops, the alien Bruchus rufimanus in faba beans, native Chaetocnema spp. in spring cereals and wireworms (Elateridae) in potato were the emergent arthropod pests of field crops. In horticultural crops, Aculops lycopersici, Bemisia tabaci, Rhagoletis batava, Igutettix oculatus, Hoplocampa flava and Hoplocampa minuta and Otiorhynchus spp. were emergent alien arthropod pests, while the greenhouse whitefly, various aphids, thrips, and Phytonemus pallidus and Tetranychus urticae were emerging mainly due to withdrawal of chemicals. Warm early summers, banning of chemicals and importation of plants and seeds were considered the major drivers of the change. Several pests not considered potential future threats in 2011 are now emergent pests in Finland, underlining rapid changes in pest emergence and the challenges of their prediction. Utilization of citizen science platforms is encouraged to enhance early observation of emerging pests.",

The purpose of this study is to examine the nonlinear effect of seasonal precipitation on the yields of winter wheat, spring wheat, oats, and spring barley using Swedish county-level data from 1979 to 2021. To this end, we use Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects. Results show that increased precipitation during the early growing season enhances crop yields except for spring barley. Increased precipitation in the second, main growing season negatively affects all crops, but the magnitude of the impact is small compared to that in the early growing season. The impacts are generally more beneficial in the southern part of the country. Irrigation of winter wheat in the spring could be profitable for farms that own irrigation equipment, but for spring crops this would only be the case under extremely dry conditions. Results point to the need for well-tailored climate adaptation strategies.",

Dietary treatments in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement consisted of two wilted silages treated with either a formic acid-based (FA) 5 l/t or a bacterial inoculant additive (I) and three levels of protein supplementation obtained by fish meal (FM) inclusion (0, 60 and 120 g/kg concentrate).

Feeding FA-silage decreased diet organic matter digestibility, particularly that of neutral detergent fibre, compared with I-silage. Inclusion of FM increased the digestibility of all dietary constituents. Dry matter (DM) intake of I-silage was lower than that of FA-silage but milk yield was not significantly affected. Restricting silage fermentation increased milk fat content, fat yield and energy corrected milk yield. FM inclusion increased silage DM intake, milk yield, milk protein content and yield. FM120 inclusion increased milk fat yield more with FA-silage than with I-silage, whereas the response in milk protein yield was greater with I-silage.

Carry over effect of the N fertilization rates (0180 kg ha-1 ) was evaluated in 1997. N fertilization rate for the best grain/seed yield (120150 kg ha-1 ) was not affected by PGRs. The seed and N yields of oilseed rape were improved most frequently by recommended use of PGR. The yields of oats were increased in 199596. Even though PGR effectively shortened the plant height of spring wheat, the grain yield increased only in 1995. N yield of wheat grains was not increased. Response of fodder barley to PGR was insignificant or even negative in 1995. The data suggest that PGRs may decrease some N leaching at high N rates by improving N uptake by grain/seeds, if the yield is improved. The carryover study showed that in soils with no N fertilization, as well as in soils of high N rates, N uptake was higher than in soils with moderate N fertilization (6090 kg ha-1 ), independent of PGRs. According to soil mineral N contents, N leaching risk is significant (1535 kg ha-1 ) only after dry and warm late seasons. After a favourable season of high yields, the N rates did not significantly affect soil mineral N contents. ;",

Sucrose in the in vitro rooting medium gave the best support to weaning survival in comparision with glucose and fructose. Directly rooted microcuttings had a higher survival rate than in vitro rooted microcuttings. AMF inoculation did not improve the rooting rate in direct rooting. However, the Glomus hoi strain V98 caused severe rotting of microcuttings and thus lowered the rooting rate of cv. Hanna, AMF inoculation increased the mean shoot height of established plants, particularly inoculation with G. hoi V98, G. claroideum V43a or G. fistulosum V128. This effect, however, varied considerably in different host-fungus combinations. Some AMF strains, e.g. G. hoi V1O4, caused strong growth retardation. After the rooting and weaning stage, many uninoculated plants lapsed into arrest of growth. This phenomenon was less frequent in AMF inoculated plants. Optimal timing of AMF inoculation and nutritional level of rooting and weaning substrate are discussed.",

The basal diets (negative controls) were principally composed of soya bean meal (SBM) and grain (wheat, barley, oats) supplemented with up to 0.10% mineral P; the positive control diets were supplemented with 0.24-0.30% mineral P. Compared with the negative control groups, which were fed diets with 0.05% mineral P either during the whole rearing period or during the starting period only, phytase addition increased live weight by 4-7% and feed intake by 3-9% (Trials 1 and 2). Tibia values indicated that with low mineral P supplementations (0.05 and 0.10%), phytase additions have a non-significant effect on bone mineralization. If mineral P is not added, the tibia values show a marked response to phytase (Trial 3). Utilization of P increased from 50.9% to 60.0% when phytase (1000 PU/g) was added to the diets without mineral P supplementation (Trial 3). Utilization of P was only 34.5% in the positive control diet (0.3% mineral P). The results were obviously affected by the intrinsic phytase activity in grain and the dietary calcium level, and suggest that, in SBM-grain-based diets with very low (0.05%) or no mineral P supplementation, weight gain can be increased by adding phytase up to 1000 PU/g. This supplemented phytase activity is apparently sufficient for adequate bone mineralization.",

The weeding effect of the different methods was measured by weighing the weeds remaining just before harvesting. Inter-row hoeing was the most effective of the mechanical methods. Weed harrowing was as good as hoeing in silty clay soil but less effective in mull soil. Rotary hoeing was the least effective. Herbicide spraying was more effective than the mechanical methods in both soils. Increasing the spacing between rows from the standard 125 mm to 250 mm decreased the yield of barley by 12-13%. Inter-row hoeing affected the yield very slightly. The yield decreasing was lower at a row spacing of 180 mm than at 250 mm. Weed harrowing and rotary hoeing decreased the yield 5-10%. Although inter-row hoeing seems to be a fairly effective method for weed control, it may be difficult to compensate for the yield loss due to the increase in row spacing.;",

The starting point is that if current farm subsidies are regarded as means to maintain the multifunctional characteristics of agriculture, what happens if subsidies are reduced. The effects of the decline in agricultural support on multifunctional characteristics of agriculture in Finland are estimated using the cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Only a part of the consequences can be assessed by the CBA due to lack of data on the economic value of many elements of multifunctional agriculture. Hence, the results should not be generalised too strongly, but they still provide useful information for the political decision-making. Concerning further research, we should study, inter alia, what the so-called correct level of compensation for the adequate supply of public goods would be, and what kind of means of agricultural policy are the most efficient to unambiguously enhance the multifunctional character of agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Competition and yield advantage in barley varietal mixtures and in barley-oats mixtures were investigated. The trials were based on replacement series, but in a few cases the overall density of the stand was varied on the basis of an addition series. Both models of competition, one based on the de Wit model and the other upon a linear regression model, agreed as to which component was the dominant and which was the subordinate in the mixture. The competition coefficients from regression analyses depicted competition between components better in a dense than in a sparse stand. The competitive ability of a genotype did not depend directly upon individual characters of the genotype, such as rate of initial development, earliness, culm height, tillering capacity or grain yield in monoculture (adaptation), A good combination of characters from the viewpoint of competition was provided by the barley cv. Arra with its rapid initial development and rapid culm growth (earliness), the variety being dominant irrespective of number of components in the mixture, stand density, level of nitrogen fertilization or growing season. This suggests that competitive relations and distribution of resources within a mixture are determined at an early stage in the growing period. In other cases the competitive ability of a genotype varied from one environment to another with the competitive relations between components being inconsistent. The dominance of an aggressor usually increased with increasing nitrogen fertilization especially when the total density of the stand was high. As a rule, competition affected all the components of yield with the kernel weight being least affected. The grain yield of varietal mixtures did not differ from the yield of the highest yielding component grown alone, i.e., mixtures did not over yield. The relative yield total of varietal mixtures was higher at low (RYT &gt; 1) than at optimal densities (RYT =1). Also the relative yield total was higher under conditions where the nitrogen fertilization was not optimal. The results of a varietal trial repeated during three successive years indicated that the relative yield total of a given mixture varied from one growing season to another, fluctuating around unity. Thus highly adapted barley varieties appear to compete for the same resources, and the grain yield advantage of such mixtures is marginal. The results of the barley-oats mixture trials revealed that the mixture may over yield. The relative yield totals of barley-oats mixtures were usually equal to or greater than unity the latter suggesting that the mixtures of barley and oats may use resources more efficiently than monocultures, and some grain yield advantage could be achieved with such mixtures. The protein yield of the barley-oats mixtures did not differ from the yield of the highest yielding component grown alone. The ratio of actual and expected protein yield and the relative protein yield total were usually slightly greater than one. The grain yields of mixtures were not consistently more stable than monocultures as determined by the coefficient of variation.",

Micropropagation techniques have been developed due to the need to increase productivity through clonal selection. Because of the mycorrhizal dependence exhibited by this crop for optimal growth and the recognized role of mycorrhiza establishment for the survival and development of most of the plants produced in vitro, the effect of mycorrhiza inoculation on the development of micropropagated plants of Annona cherimola was investigated. Mycorrhizal inoculation was assayed at two different stages of the micropropagation process: (i) immediately after the in vitro phase, before starting the acclimatization period, and (ii) after the acclimatization phase, before starting the post-acclimatization period under greenhouse conditions. Plantlet survival was about 50 % after the acclimatization period. Plant growth and development profited remarkably from mycorrhiza establishment. Most of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) assayed greatly increased shoot and root biomass and leaf area. Micropropagated Annona plants seem to be more dependent on mycorrhiza formation for optimal growth than plants derived from seeds. The greatest effects of AMF on plant growth were observed when they were introduced after the acclimatization period.",

Examination of nitrogen deficient leaves by transmission electron microscopy showed dramatic changes in chloroplast ultrastructure.

The crude protein (CP) content of the pea and field bean cultivars ranged from 244 to 279 and from 320 to 347 g/kg dry matter (DM), respectively. The concentrations of several essential amino acids in protein decreased as the CP content increased. In peas, predicted in vivo digestibilities did not correlate with chemical composition, and in field beans were lower than in peas. A digestibility trial was carried out on six cannulated barrows according to a 6 ´ 5 cyclic change-over design to determine the faecal and ileal nutrient digestibilities of organically grown leafed peas (cv.

For producing high quality naked oat seed, it is recommended that harvesting be carried out at as low grain moisture content as possible. This reduces mechanical damage to the grain and promotes germination. Under northern growing conditions, grains are often harvested at 20% moisture content or higher. In this study, reduced grain resulted from using gentler settings on the combine harvester. Two naked oat cultivars and one conventional oat were harvested at different grain moisture content using three combine harvester settings: the first setting that recommended for conventional oat, the second a reduced cylinder speed and the third a narrow concave clearance. The greater the grain moisture content of naked oat at harvest, the more damage was caused by threshing. Lower cylinder speeds tended to result in better germination than higher speeds, even under moist conditions. Narrowing the concave clearance did not affect germination.",

Also the relative importance of water for swimming, the empty cage and the nest box was measured. Seventy-eight farm mink were placed in four groups according to a 2x2 experimental design: two unit sizes, large and small, and two water conditions, with or without water. Each unit consisted of three cages side by side in which half of the animals had a water filled basin and the other half an empty area in the middle cage. This cage had openings to the other two cages. In addition, a tunnel above the basin connected the right and left cage. One hour before the beginning of daily observations the animals had their access restricted to only the left cage. Each animal was observed ten times a day on nine consecutive days. No difference in scratching into the tunnel, basin or nest box was detected between the four groups. All groups scratched significantly or nearly significantly more into the nest box than into both the tunnel and the basin. Most stereotypies were found in the group in small cages with a dry basin. Our investigation suggests that when compared to the deprivation from a nest box, the deprivation of water for swimming does not alone cause frustration of farm mink any more that the exclusion from an empty cage. However, it does indicate that the cage size may affect the level of stereotypy.;",

The experimental sites (8 Cambisols, 9 Regosols, 6 Histosols, 1 Podsol) were moderately acidic (pH w 5.6, range 4.6-6.6) and contained 1.6-31.2% organic C, and (mineral soils) 3-74% clay. The concentration of total P was 1.22 (0.66-1.87) g kg -1 , and the inorganic fraction separated with fluoride and hydroxide extractions (Al,Fe-P) was 8.2% (4.5-12.4%) of oxalate extractable Al+Fe (P saturation index). In mineral topsoil the pool of Al,Fe-P was 850 kg ha -1 , which is 300 kg ha -1 larger than was obtained in the early 1960s and 600 kg ha -1 larger than found in virgin soils. The soil test P value was 13.1 (3.7-60) mg dm -3 by the acid ammonium acetate method, 11.5 (1.6-42) mg dm -3 by a water extraction method (1:60 v/v) and 61 (23-131) mg kg -1 with a modified Olsen method. The intensity factor of soil P status has remained at a relatively low level in a major part of the cultivated area.;",

    "abstract": "Most dry dog foods are based on cereals, but very little published information and few comparative studies are available on the nutritive value of various cereals in dogs. To determine the apparent nutrient digestibilities and feed values of five different autoclave-processed and ground cereals: oat groats, barley, wheat, corn and rice, a digestibility trial was carried out on twelve adult huskies according to a 6 x 4 cyclic changeover design. Total tract organic matter (OM), crude carbohydrate and gross energy (GE) digestibilities were higher in rice than in all the other cereals. Apparent crude protein (CP) and acid hydrolyzed fat digestibilities of rice (80% and 94%, respectively) were as good as for oat groats (81% and 93%). However, oat groats had higher OM, CP and GE digestibilities than barley, wheat and corn. The amount of digestible crude protein (118 g kg-1 DM) was higher in oat groats than in the other cereals. Digestible energy contents (MJ kg-1 DM) of oat groats, rice, corn, wheat and barley were 17.1, 16.0, 15.7, 15.6 and 15.5, respectively. The quantity of excreted wet faeces increased and the percentage of dry matter (DM) in faeces decreased when oat groats, barley, wheat or corn were supplemented to the basal diet, in contrast to rice, which had the opposite effect on wet faeces excretion. Oat groats are good substitutes for rice or other cereals in dry dog foods.;",

    "abstract": "Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are exogenously applied chemicals that alter plant metabolism, cell division, cell enlargement, growth and development by regulating plant hormones or other biological signals. For example, some PGRs regulate stem elongation by inhibiting biosynthesis of gibberellins or through releasing ethylene. PGR effects are widely studied and reported on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), whereas there are only a few reports addressing oat (Avena sativa L.). This is likely to be a result of smaller acreage and lower intensity of oat management and production and hence a reduced need for stem shortening by PGRs. However, this is not the case for all cereal producing regions and there exists a need to understand the potential application of PGRs to oat production. This paper represents a review of the potential of PGRs to regulate stem elongation and other biological traits governing plant stand structure and yield components, with special emphasis on oat and its responses to PGRs. Yield improvement requires more heads per unit land area, more grains per head or heavier grains. Of these yield-determining parameters, the number of head bearing tillers and grain numbers per head, compared with grain weight, are more likely to be improved by PGR application. In the absence of lodging, PGR may reduce grain yield due to potential reduction in mean grain weight and/or grain number. Cultivation systems aiming at extensive yields with intensive use of inputs likely benefit from PGR applications more often compared with low or moderate input cultivation, for which cost effectiveness of PGRs is not frequently reached.;",

    "abstract": "The calculation of whole-farm nutrient balance is an effective and simple method for estimating the potential nutrient loading from dairy farming into the environment. In Finland, however, the published results based on larger number of farms are still lacking. In this study whole-farm nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances on Finnish dairy farms were studied based on short-cut data for the year 2002. The survey was targeted to 1260 dairy farms, located all over Finland. Of the 386 replies received, 319 were used for subsequent statistical analyses. The association between selected farm variables and nutrient balance was studied using regression analysis and a sensitivity coefficient was calculated for each regression slope. The average (± standard deviation) whole-farm nutrient balance for N and P was 109 (±41.3) and 12 (±7.2) kg ha-1, respectively. The most responsive factors affecting the nutrient balances were total nutrient and fertilizer import per ha, followed by animal density, milk export per ha and concentrate import per ha. The results suggested that nutrient surpluses could be controlled more easily in combined crop and milk than in specialised milk production. It is concluded that nutrient surplus on Finnish dairy farms is markedly lower than that on areas with intensive production in central European countries. However, when nutrient balances were extrapolated to comparable production intensity as in central Europe, the level of the surpluses was equal.;",

By means of P fractionation, we studied the fate of P in 35 soils that had received long-term surplus P rates as fox and mink manure P (F&amp;MM-P), considered as a sparingly soluble P source. We compared these data with those from the same soils under a more typical P management, i.e., fields amended with soluble P sources superphosphate and dairy manure (SP+DM). Fractionation of manures according to the Hedley procedure suggested limited solubility of F&amp;MM-P, two-thirds of the F&amp;MM-P being soluble in acid (HCl) only. In mineral soils, surplus F&amp;MM-P accumulated for the most part as HCl-P (poorly available), whereas in organic soils accumulation occurred largely as NaOH-soluble (moderately available) and labile P. Translocation of F&amp;MM-P was evidenced by P fractionation and by agronomic P test: subsurface soil of F&amp;MM-amended fields contained more P than the same soils in fields amended with SP+DM. In the 35 soils that had received surplus F&amp;MM-P, agronomic P status was classified as excessive in 90% of the samples taken from the plough layer, in 75% of those from 2040 cm depth, and in 50% of those from 4060 cm depth. In the reference soils amended with SP+DM, excessive P status was recorded for 23% of the plough layer samples and 4% of the subsurface samples. These results show that manure P which appears as sparingly soluble in P fractionation may in a longer term increase the content of labile soil P and translocate in the soil profile when applied in high rates.;",

In this study we use two approaches to consider whether agricultural landscapes are preferred as a destination for recreation (day trips) and rural tourism (overnight trips). We first analyse the choice of recreation site type based on a model that aggregates sites using the presence of agricultural land as an aggregation variable. Population survey data on recreation trips reveal an association between the respondents living environment, recreational activities and visit characteristics and the probability of choosing a destination with agricultural land. Second, we also estimate the demand functions for trips to agricultural sites and other destination types to consider whether the presence of agricultural land, as opposed to other land use categories, increases the number of trips and the benefits of recreation. The results suggest that agricultural landscapes are inferior to alternative site types in terms of per-trip benefits. However, agricultural landscapes are associated with high annual benefits because of the high rate of visitation.;",

Inoculation with Lactobacillus buchneri 40788, for a final application rate of 1×105 cfu g-1 of fresh forage ensiled in laboratory silos during 80 days, promoted a higher CP concentration. Furthermore, it promoted changes in the concentration of fermentation end products, decreasing lactic acid and increasing acetic and propionic acids.

The control finishing diet was based on barley and soybean meal, and the fibrous finishing diet was based on barley, barley fibre, faba beans, and rapeseed cake. These diets contained 465 and 362 g starch and 177 and 250 g dietary fibre per kg, respectively. The fasting times of 25 and 41 h were obtained by giving the pigs their last meal at different times. Longer fasting lowered the glycolytic potential of the longissimus lumborum muscle (P = 0.01), whereas the finishing diet had no effect. Different muscles responded differently to the treatments. Longer fasting increased the ultimate pH of the semimembranosus muscle (P = 0.02), but did not affect that of the longissimus lumborum and semispinalis capitis muscles. The finishing diets did not affect the ultimate pH of the investigated muscles. A diet × fasting time interaction was seen in the lightness of the semimembranosus muscle (P = 0.05). The fibrous diet resulted in darker meat than the control diet did in pigs that were fasted for 25 h (P &lt; 0.05). Longer fasting darkened the meat colour in pigs fed the fibrous diet (P &lt; 0.05) but not in those fed the control diet. The meat from the semispinalis capitis muscle was darker in pigs fed the fibrous than those fed the control diet (P = 0.04). The treatments did not affect the colour of the longissimus lumborum muscle. Longer fasting decreased drip loss from the meat of pigs fed the control diet (P &lt; 0.05). The eating quality of the pork was not influenced by the finishing diets or the fasting time. The pigs also grew equally fast on both finishing diets. In conclusion, a moderate alteration in the carbohydrate composition of a finishing diet or longer pre-slaughter fasting can have some effects on pork quality in crossbred pigs, but these effects vary in different muscles.;",

    "abstract": "Development of black scurf on potato tubers (cv. Nicola) was compared in plants inoculated with isolates of Rhizoctonia solani of three anastomosis groups (AG2-1, AG3 and AG5) which occur in potato crops in Finland. All isolates induced stem canker lesions but only isolates of AG3 formed efficiently black scurf on progeny tubers. Among the AG2-1 and AG5 isolates tested, only one AG2-1 isolate formed a few sclerotia on 13.5 % of the progeny tubers in one experiment. The data indicate that isolates of AG3 differ from those of AG2-1 and AG5 in having a higher ability to form sclerotia on tubers. Therefore, while AG2-1 and AG5 isolates have a broader host range, AG3 is more efficient in producing black scurf, which provides this anastomosis group with more efficient means of dissemination on seed potatoes. These differences probably explain the predominance of AG3 (98.9 % of isolates) in potato crops in Finland and other northern potato production areas.;",

    "abstract": "Policy harmonized (PH) approach allows for the quantitative assessment of the impact of various elements of EU CAP direct support schemes, where the production effects of direct payments are accounted through reaction prices formed by producer price and policy price add-ons. Using the AGMEMOD model the impacts of two possible EU agricultural policy scenarios upon beef production have been analysed  full decoupling with a switch from historical to regional Single Payment scheme or alternatively with re-distribution of country direct payment envelopes via introduction of EU-wide flat area payment. The PH approach, by systematizing and harmonizing the management and use of policy data, ensures that projected differential policy impacts arising from changes in common EU policies reflect the likely actual differential impact as opposed to differences in how common policies are implemented within analytical models. In the second section of the paper the AGMEMOD models structure is explained. The policy harmonized evaluation method is presented in the third section. Results from an application of the PH approach are presented and discussed in the papers penultimate section, while section 5 concludes.;",

The age, yield, C:N, biological N fixation (BNF) and total N of red clover-grass leys were studied for their influence on yields, N uptake and N use efficiency (NUE) of the two sequential cereal crops planted after the leys. Mineral N in deeper soil (30-90 cm) was measured to determine N leaching risk. Altogether, four field experiments were carried out in 1994-1998 at two sites. The age of the ley had no significant effect on the yields and N uptake of the two subsequent cereals. Surprisingly, the residual effect of the leys was negligible, at 020 kg N ha-1yr-1. On the other hand, the yield and C:N of previous red clover-grass leys, as well as BNF-N and total-N incorporated into the soil influenced subsequent cereals. NUEs of cereals after ley incorporation were rather high, varying from 30% to 80%. This might indicate that other factors, such as competition from weeds, prevented maximal growth of cereals. The mineral N content deeper in the soil was mostly below 10 kg ha-1 in the sandy soil of Juva, but was 5-25 kg ha-1 in clayey soil of Mietoinen.;",

    "abstract": "Modeling tools are needed to assess (i) the amounts of loading from agricultural sources to water bodies as well as (ii) the alternative management options in varying climatic conditions. These days, the implementation of Water Framework Directive (WFD) has put totally new requirements also for modeling approaches. The physically based models are commonly not operational and thus the usability of these models is restricted for a few selected catchments. But the rewarding feature of these process-based models is an option to study the effect of protection measures on a catchment scale and, up to a certain point, a possibility to upscale the results. In this study, the parameterization of the SWAT model was developed in terms of discharge dynamics and nutrient loads, and a sensitivity analysis regarding discharge and sediment concentration was made. The SWAT modeling exercise was carried out for a 2nd order catchment (Yläneenjoki, 233 km2) of the Eurajoki river basin in southwestern Finland. The Yläneenjoki catchment has been intensively monitored during the last 14 years. Hence, there was enough background information available for both parameter setup and calibration. In addition to load estimates, SWAT also offers possibility to assess the effects of various agricultural management actions like fertilization, tillage practices, choice of cultivated plants, buffer strips, sedimentation ponds and constructed wetlands (CWs) on loading. Moreover, information on local agricultural practices and the implemented and planned protective measures were readily available thanks to aware farmers and active authorities. Here, we studied how CWs can reduce the nutrient load at the outlet of the Yläneenjoki river basin. The results suggested that sensitivity analysis and autocalibration tools incorporated in the model are useful by pointing out the most influential parameters, and that flow dynamics and annual loading values can be modeled with reasonable accuracy with SWAT. Sensitivity analysis thus showed the parameters which should be known better in order to result in more realistic parameter values. Moreover, the scenario runs for CWs made with SWAT revealed the high demand of land area for this protective measure to be substantially effective.;",

We measured bulk density, air permeability and precompression stress in a clay soil (Vertic Cambisol) and a sandy loam (Haplic Regosol) in Finland, to identify management-related changes in the physical and mechanical properties in the surface soil of buffer zones. In addition, the impact of texture on these properties was studied at depths down to 180?200 cm. Soil cores (240 cm3) were sampled from a cultivated field, from buffer zones harvested by grazing (only in a clay soil) or by cutting and removing the vegetation, and from buffer zones covered with natural grass vegetation. The samples were equilibrated at a matric potential of -6 kPa and compressed at a normal stress range of 20-400 kPa (7 h), followed by stress removal (1 h). Generally, the clay soil was more compressible than the sandy loam. Due to trampling by cattle, the young grazed buffer zone (0-3 cm) had the largest bulk density and the smallest total porosity. For the grazed sites, reduced air permeability (2.7-5.1 × 10-5 m s-1) was found, compared with that of the buffer zone under natural vegetation (15-22 × 10-5 m s-1), indicating decreased pore continuity. Although the old grazed site was easily compressed, compared with the younger site, it showed a greater resilience capacity due to the protective cover of organic residues accumulated on the soil surface.",

By estimating the potential of individual mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, resources can be targeted to the most promising policy measures. This paper reports two agricultural emission scenarios for Finland up to year 2020, one baseline scenario (Scenario 1) based on the projected agricultural production levels determined by markets and agricultural policy and one with selected mitigation measures included (Scenario 2). Measures selected for the analysis consisted of 1) keeping agricultural area at the current level, 2) decreasing the proportion of organic soils, 3) increasing the proportion of grass cultivation on organic soils and 4) supporting biogas production on farms. Starting from 2005, the emissions of nitrous oxide and methane from agriculture would decrease 2.3% in Scenario 1 by 2020 whereas the respective decrease would be 11.5% in Scenario 2. According to the results, mitigation measures targeted to cultivation of organic soils have the largest potential to reduce the emissions. Such measures would include reducing the area of cultivated organic soils and increasing the proportion of perennial crops on the remaining area.",

Data from single experimental fields are seldom representative for the whole respective catchment. In this study typical soil profiles for mineral agricultural soils in Finland are defined. Key parameters describing e.g. the texture and water holding capacity of soils, were generated from existing soil data using expert knowledge and are aimed to be used for field-scale modelling when the target is not to model a particular field but soils of certain type in general. Estimates for water balance and phosphorus losses, obtained with the ICECREAM model by applying these data sets, were realistic and compatible with experimental results measured in Finland.;",

We report here long-term nutrient removal performance of two on-site sand filters (F1 and F2) in southwestern Finland, established in the 1990s. The sand filters were enhanced with a layer of phosphorus binding material Fosfilt-s, a side product of titanium dioxide production. The monitoring periods were 4.5 and 3.5years for F1 and F2, respectively. F1 only worked for some months due to blockage of the crushed stone layer. After renovation (1999), the filter worked for a year but then the Fosfilt-s layer clogged and the filter increased suspended solids (SS) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loads by 36% and 19% on average, respectively. Total P (PTOT) load was not affected. The structure and performance of F2 were more successful due to a better water distribution system. On average, 61% ofthe inflowing suspended solids, 37% of the PTOT and 45% of the DRP were removed during the monitoring period. We conclude that these filter types have the potential to be further developed into useful tools for nutrient load reduction. Development work should be focused on the treatment of subsurface drainage waters with high concentrations of dissolved nutrients, in particular. Long term field data is needed, because laboratory tests cannot fully simulate natural circumstances.",

To test the capacity of PSS to detect signature ADE properties we measured electrical conductivity (ECa), magnetic susceptibility (MSa) and gamma ray data by transect sampling and compared these readings, using fuzzy classification, with datasets on chemical soil properties from a 28 ha large study area located on the Belterra Plateau of the Lower Amazon in northern Brazil.

The ash after its combustion contained 11.33–13.38% of phosphorous, 4.94–5.67% of potassium, 31.85–32.69% of calcium and 2.07–2.51% of magnesium. Moreover, the ash contained 0.45-0.46% of iron, 0.10–0.11% of manganese, 0.11–0.14 of zinc and 0.02% of copper. Mineral combusted residue of this type of granules has a low content of heavy metals and can be used as an additive to fertilizers and soil improvers, in order to enrich their composition in valuable macro- and micronutrients.",

The amount of retained phosphorus in the different fractions was computed by taking the difference between the treated and check samples. In the 70 samples of clay soils, the mean proportion of the retained phosphorus was 57 per cent of the 250 mg/kg applied, in the 62 samples of the sand and fine sand soils the corresponding part was 45 per cent, and in the 48 samples of loam and silt soils it was 44 per cent. The higher retention in the clay soils was mainly due to a higher retention in the alkali-soluble fraction. The net increase in the fluoride-soluble forms was of the same order in these three soil groups. On the average, more than 95 per cent of the sorbed phosphorus was found in the fluoride-soluble and alkali-soluble fractions. In one third of the samples a low net increase in the acid soluble fraction was detected, but this may be partly due to changes in the solubility of the native phosphorus in the treated samples. Owing to the fairly large variation, the tendency to somewhat higher mean values for the sorption in the subsoils compared with those of the topsoils was not statistically significant. The ratio between the sorbed amounts of fluoride-soluble and alkali soluble forms was higher in the sand and fine sand soils than in the clay soils. Only in 15 samples, most of them Litorina-soils, the net increase in the alkali-soluble forms was higher than in the fluoride-soluble fraction. Probably, because an equilibrium in the phosphorus conditions was not yet reached at the end of the treatment, the attempt failed to find any clear connection between the distribution of the sorbed phosphorus and such soil properties as pH, the contents of acid oxalate soluble aluminium and iron, organic carbon, the phosphate sorption capacity and the degree of phosphate saturation. Only in the subsoil samples, 76 per cent of the variation in the net increase in the fluoride-soluble fraction could be explained by the variation on the content of oxalate-soluble aluminium, and in the topsoil samples the oxalate-soluble iron and pH determined 61 per cent of the variation in the net increase in the alkali-soluble phosphorus. The ratio of oxalate-soluble aluminium to iron was more closely correlated with the ratio between the total amounts of fluoride-soluble and alkali-soluble phosphorus than with the ratio between the corresponding sorbed amounts. In the topsoils, it explained 70 per cent of the variation in the former. The distribution of the retained phosphorus did not depend on the soil pH, its content of organic carbon, or its degree of phosphate saturation but there was some tendency to a higher accumulation of alkali-soluble phosphorus compared with the fluoride-soluble forms with an increase in the phosphate sorption capacity of the soil.",

We used an indoor rainfall simulation to monitor concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP) and faecal coliforms in runoff and percolation water from different paddock footings. Drainage water was also monitored from two paddocks constructed of woodchips. Sand retained more DRP (p&lt;0.0001) and coliforms from percolation water than woodchips. Some of the footings were amended with P-sorbing materials, such as [Ca(OH)2], [Fe2(SO4)3], or Fe-gypsum, to retain DRP. High DRP concentrations (17–18 mg l-1) were observed in runoff from a woodchip footing amended earlier with Ca(OH)2 and in sand footing amended with CaCO3. However, application of Fe-gypsum to woodchips decreased the DRP load in percolation water by 83% compared to the footing without Fe-gypsum. Fe compounds were better than Ca compounds. The decrease in coliforms was usually small due to the modest pH changes in the water.",

The proposed analysis is based on the description of field working dynamics collected on an experimental tractor during a plowing operation. The energy needs can there be characterized as having a dual alternating profile, depending on the tractor working phase within the field. As a result, two field oriented performance indicators consisting in time efficiency [h.ha-1] and area specific consumption [l.ha-1] are defined out of the profile characteristics. A model converting the draft of an implement into an engine running point is then developed to compute these indicators. The model is fitted on data collected over conventional bench tests, and is validated by an application to a plowing operation. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis on the operational parameters is conducted.",

The three dietary treatments included either first-, second- or third-cut grass silage (550 g kg-1 dry matter), rolled barley (435 g kg-1 dry matter) and a mineral-vitamin mixture (15 g kg-1 dry matter). Dry matter and energy intakes and growth rates of the bulls increased when either first- or third-cut silages were used instead of the second-cut silage. This was probably due to differences in digestibility, which was the lowest in the second-cut silage. There were no differences in intake or growth between the first- and third-cut silage-based rations. No significant differences in carcass traits among the feeding treatments were observed.",

The aim of the experiment was to establish the influence of deep and shallow ploughing, chiselling, disking and no-tillage systems on parameters of maize productivity. No-tillage resulted in a significant decrease in maize stand density compared with deep and shallow ploughing, as well as chiselling, while maize canopy height and dry biomass was slightly higher in the no-tillage system. Nevertheless, in no-tillage plots the maize yield was insignificantly lower than in deeply and shallowly ploughed plots (on average 3.5–6.4% less). Overall, long-term reduction of primary tillage had less impact on maize productivity parameters than meteorological conditions during the vegetation period.",

For this purpose, the relevance of the currently used Hydrothermal Coefficient (HTC) and five drought indices widely used in other countries were reassessed. It was found that the methodologies applied in Lithuania and other countries are not completely suitable under current conditions. A new agricultural drought identification methodology using the Temperature–Precipitation Index (TPI) is proposed as a result of this study. Analysis of long-term changes (1961–2019) in reoccurrence of droughts was carried out. It was determined that the largest number of droughts in Lithuania was recorded in the last decade of the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century. Despite the fact that there is a positive tendency in reoccurrence of droughts, the changes are not statistically significant.",

Harvesting at the end of day delayed the loss of chlorophylls and caused the lowest decrement in sugars, although no differences in invertase, sucrose synthase and β-amylase activities were detected among samples. Treatments of MA and 1-MCP caused a lower loss of glucose and fructose, while HT caused a lower decrement of sucrose. Treated samples maintained higher levels of chlorophylls. The treatments reduced the activity of invertase and sucrose synthase and induced higher levels of β-amylase activity. Harvesting at the end of day and performing simultaneously a MA treatment could be a good combination to maintain the green color of the inflorescence and sugar levels during postharvest of broccoli.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) from agricultural systems contributes to the eutrophication of waterbodies through leaching. Incorporating organic material with a high carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio, such as mixed pulp mill sludges (PMSs), into the soil in autumn could reduce the amount of leachable N. This study tested the potential of composted and lime-stabilised mixed PMSs (CPMS and LPMS) in reducing the concentration of mineral N in the soil, and thus the risk of N leaching from arable land in the boreal region using a two-year field experiment. To better understand the mechanisms of the PMSs for influencing mineral N concentration in soil, the impact of PMSs with different quality on the reactions of N in the soil was investigated in a laboratory incubation study. In the field experiment, nitrate-N (NO3--N) concentration was lower with PMSs compared to mineral fertilisation and the control during the first autumn and the following spring after PMS application. The undersowing of Italian ryegrass reduced the NO3--N concentration in the soil during the first autumn. In the incubation experiment, PMSs reduced the soil ammonium-N (NH4+-N) concentration at the beginning of the experiment and the soil NO3--N concentration throughout the experiment compared to a mineral fertiliser treatment and an organic fertiliser. Increased soil respiration in PMS-treated soils indicated increase in microbial activity, and thus immobilisation of soil NO3--N and NH4+-N due to PMSs addition. These results suggest that PMSs have the potential to reduce N leaching from agricultural soils. However, the immobilisation of N must be considered when planning the nutrient requirements of the following crops.",

Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted on three farms. Farmers and employees were interviewed. The material was analysed using a qualitative approach inspired by qualitative content analysis. For the farmers and employees, animal well-being was central for various reasons and from different perspectives. Despite the differences, the impact of animal well-being was interlinked between the two groups. An increased and deeper understanding of the different perspectives and needs arising from the different roles of farmers and employees can provide new knowledge about factors important for improvinganimal well-being.",

    "abstract": "A field experiment was established in 1978 on a loam soil (pH in CaCl2 7.1) to monitor gradual changes in the soil P status as response to different P fertilization regimes. For 18 years, cereals or grass were cultivated without P fertilization (P0) or with annual P application of 35 kg ha-1 (P1) or 70-79 kg P ha-1 and 71-83 kg K ha-1 (P2K). The effects of the treatments on the crop yield varied yearly. The Chang and Jackson fractionation analysis revealed that fertilizer P not taken up by the plant crops was mostly in the NH4F extract and to a lesser extent in the NaOH extract. The NH4F-extractable P proved also to be the main P source for plants. However, the changes in the reserves of inorganic and organic P did not agree very well with the calculated P balance in soil (applied P minus plant P uptake). This disproportion was partly explained by the soil movement from plots to the neighbouring ones during the experiment. Phosphorus extractable in acid ammonium acetate or water decreased gradually when no P was applied and increased with increasing P accumulation. The changes in the inorganic P reserves due to different P fertilization history were reflected a little more sensitively in the water extraction test than in the acid acetate test.",

    "abstract": "Indicators can be used for identifying, simplifying and quantifying agri-environmental aspects of sustainability. They offer us a way to proceed from the theoretical definition of sustainability to more practically oriented approaches. This study examines agricultural systems with a view to identifying the points and levels at which the sustainability of these systems can be assessed. The agri-environmental indicators are presented within the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework. Although suitable for ecological indicators, this framework is not highly relevant for economic and social indicators, which were thus studied from a more general theoretical perspective. As the concept of sustainability includes a number of different value-laden definitions, the setting of indicators should be seen as an ongoing re-evaluation rather than a technical process of measuring certain parameters. The need to refine the assessment methods was recognised in several subthemes of agricultural sustainability. A major shortcoming was found to be the lack of tools for evaluating qualitative phenomena such as landscapes and animal welfare. Likewise, in economics and the social sciences, much needs to be done to promote understanding of the interactions between these disciplines and environmental processes. Moreover, the basic framework of the assessments requires further examination, for instance, when interpreting the indicator results, when dealing with uncertainty and when seeking to identify cause-effect chains, even though these questions are no longer purely matters of indicator methodology.;",

    "abstract": "Field experiments were performed in Southern Finland on three soil types: fine sand (1989-1991), clay (1989) and mull (1990-1991). The following soil mechanical treatments were applied to autumn ploughed land: soil loosening by ridge preparation (ridge distance 45 cm), rotary harrowing (to a depth of 20 cm, clay 15 cm), and soil compaction track by track by a tractor weighing 3 Mg (1 or 3 passes, wheel width 33 cm) before seed bed preparation. One plot was untreated. These treatments were set up in April (on clay in May) under moist soil conditions. Sprinkler irrigation (one application of 30 mm) was applied to clay and fine sand when soil moisture in top soil had decreased to around 50% of plant-available water capacity. PVC cylinders (r = 15 cm, h = 60 cm) were fixed in the experimental areas during the growing periods. At harvest, these cylinders were removed for specific analysis of tap and fibrous roots of carrot. Length and width of fibrous roots were quantified by image analysis in the USA. The impacts of soil loosening and partial compaction were determined by measuring soil physical parameters to a depth of 25 cm in mineral soils, and to greater depths in organic soil. Dry bulk densities of the plough layers increased with increasing tractor passes by 8%, 10% and 13% for fine sand, mull and clay soils, respectively. The lowest dry soil bulk density in the plough layer was obtained by rotary harrowing to a depth of 20 cm. Comparison of gamma ray transmission and gravimetric analysis indicated that dry soil bulk density was slightly lower when determined by gravimetric analysis. Increased soil bulk densities were reflected by increased water retention capacity (matric suction ≤ 10 kPa) and greater penetrometer resistance. Relatively similar increases in bulk density increased the penetrometer resistance much less in mull than in fine sand. In contrast, greater bulk densities in the mull soil affected soil air composition adversely by decreasing the O2 content to 10% when the subsoil had high wetness. In other soils, the lowest soil oxygen contents of 16-18% were recorded in early summer (compacted clay) and during periods of vigorous plant growth (fine sand) when soil water contents were high. Even though the highest degree of soil compactness (D) in a plough layer approached 93 (gravimetric) in all soils, only clay soil was compacted to a soil macro-porosity below 10% (pore diameter &gt; 30 μm). Soil compaction promoted crop establishment and early growth as compared with loose soil beds. Optimum soil compactness for carrot yield (D = 82) was observed only in clay field where excess loosening or compaction affected yield quantity adversely at different stages of growth. During biomass accumulation, excessive penetrometer resistances limited tap root growth in compacted fine sand without irrigation. Water applications promoted shoot growth, but did not affect final shoot and tap root yield. Among the three soil types tested in this study, compaction of mull soil had the least effect on carrot growth and external quality. This paper presents evidence that the internal quality of carrots is only slightly affected by changes in soil physical properties, while the adverse effects of soil compaction on carrot external quality (short, deformed and conical tap roots with greater maximum diameters) are clear. Even though compacted clay soil greatly limited the biomass accumulations in the tap root, which had a high crude fibre content, the carotene (10 mg/100 g carrots) and sugar contents (5%) reached acceptable levels. The lowest carotene contents (4 mg/100 g carrots) were observed in loose mull, following a cool late summer in 1990. The effect of irrigation on carotene content varied from one year to another. High sugar and carotene contents appeared to respond to the high below-ground absorption surface. The fibrous root system of carrots, consisting of mostly very fine roots (diameter 0.15 mm), had total lengths of 150 m in loose fine sand at a soil depth of 0-50 cm (rotary harrowed), 200 m and 300 m in fine sand and mull soils subjected to 3 passes by a tractor wheel. The maximum dry weight (60 μg), length (1.2 cm) and surface area (0.05 cm2) of the fibrous root system per soil volume (cm3) were observed in compacted or irrigated soil to a depth of 30 cm, and also in relation to tap root dry weight. This suggests a capacity of carrot plant for high below-ground absorption potential and optimal biochemial maturation of tap root tissue even when surface soils are compacted. This is supported by higher leaf area, as the early shoot growth was promoted by partial soil compaction. Soil compaction affected the soil physical properties and carrot external quality in agreement with previous studies. Carotene and sugar contents appeared to be unaffected or were slightly increased in riper and firmer carrots of compacted soils. This is consistent with the earlier information about the internal quality of carrot which is shown to be highly dependent on genetic factors and developmental stage of carrot. The present study emphasizes the surface area of carrot fibrous root system as a beneficial factor for maintaining high levels of carotene and sugar contents in tap roots after partial soil compaction.",

The effect of basic induction media, pretreatment on mannitol medium, density of anthers, incubation temperature and light regime were tested. Pretreatment of anthers for 4 days on medium containing 0.175 M mannitol was beneficial for all 8 genotypes tested and increased production of green plants per 100 anthers from 26% to 74% for the best genotype (‘lnari’ x ‘Kymppi’ F1). A lower anther density (1.6 anthers per cm2) was better than a more dense one. A modified MS-medium with ammonium nitrate partly replaced with glutamine (MMS-MG) was slightly better than a medium based on N6 salts (N6-MG), and addition of 100 μM silver nitrate reduced both plant and green plant production. No significant differences were observed between the effects of incubation temperatures (20°C vs. 25°C) or the light regime (darkness vs. weak light) during incubation of anthers. In each experiment the genotypic effect was prominent and the recalcitrance of some genotypes was apparent. Green plants were produced however from all genotypes.",

The study was conducted as a 23 factorial experiment with six randomized complete blocks. The average initial and final live weights of the bulls were 123 kg and 494 kg, respectively. The crude protein content of the ad libitum fed EC and LC silages, cut at an interval of eight days, was 159 and 131 g kg-1 DM. However, the difference in the estimated content of AAT (= amino acids absorbed in the small intestine) between the two silages was small, whereas there was a large difference in PBV (= protein balance in the rumen). The respective values for crude fibre were 278 and 304 g kg-1 DM. At the beginning of the experiment the voluntary grass silage intake of the EC bulls was higher than that of the LC bulls. Towards the end of the experiment the difference in silage intake between the two stages of cut disappeared. This change in voluntary grass silage intake was followed by a similar change in the rate of daily live weight gain (LWG): the EC bulls started to grow faster than the LC bulls, but the initial slower LWG of the LC bulls had been compensated by the end of the experiment. The LL bulls had a higher intake of silage than the HL bulls. The substitution rate was 0.63 kg silage DM per concentrate DM, regardless of the stage ofcut. HL feeding resulted in faster LWG. Owing, at least partly, to the improved diet digestibility, inclusion of rapeseed meal in the diet increased the silage intake throughout the experiment followed by a faster LWG. The positive effect of rapeseed meal was unaffected by the stage ofmaturity of the grass for silage and the level of concentrate supply. The animals were not able to take full advantage of the high protein content of the EC silage. The inclusion of rapeseed meal in the diet, however, improved the rate of gain and resulted in more efficient feed conversion.",

The rates of P applied yearly in granular NPK fertilizers were 0, 13/16, 26/32, 47/56 and 60/72 kg P/ha in 1974—82/1983 —85. Oats, barley, spring wheat and winter wheat were grown, in two years also oil seed crops. In one experiment, the maximum yield of cereal grains in the first nine years (4 460 kg/ha) was reached at the P rate of 13 kg/ha, but thereafter at 32 kg P/ha. The average difference between the maximum yields and the ones obtained without P fertilization was 470 kg/ha (12 %) in 1974—80, but during the last four years the difference increased to 1 360 kg/ha (40 %), owing to the depletion of P in the plots not fertilized with P. Also in the other experiment, in which the maximum yield of cereal grains (4 790 kg/ha) was obtained at the P rate of 26/32 kg/ha, the response to P fertilization increased towards the end of the trial, the mean response during the last three years being 570 kg/ha (12 %). Phosphorus fertilization, up to the P level at which the maximum yield was reached, decreased the moisture content of cereal grains at harvest. The quantity of P extracted with 0.5 M NH4-acetate-0.5 M acetic acid (pH 4.65) decreased in the plots not fertilized with P, from 5.8 mg/l to 2.2 mg/l and from 6.2 mg/l to 1.8 mg/l in the course of the two trials. The original level of acetate-extractable P was somewhat maintained but not elevated by P rates of 26/32, 47/56 and 60/72 kg/ha.

This work is concerned with spatial hydrogeochemical patterns, remediation measures and the juridical obligation to improve water quality in one such area, i.e. the Rintala plain (23 km2) in mid-western Finland.

The juridical obligation to improve the water quality is inappropriate as it does not consider the main reason for the poor water quality, i.e. drainage by subsurface drainage pipes, and because of the equality principle (other acid sulphate soil areas have just as poor water quality but do not have such an obligation). Groundwater management, i.e. keeping the groundwater level as high as possible, is recommended as the best management practice.;",

A semi-quantitative method of pollen analysis based online counts was developed. It was found efficient for determining the relative numbers of pollen grains in the honey samples. On average, ca. 16 pollen types were identified per sample. The number of honeydew elements was low in all samples. Brassicaceae pollen was the dominant type. The other most frequent and abundant types were pollen grains of Trifolium repens + T. hybridum, Salix spp., \"the Rosaceae group” (Prunus, Malus, Sorbus spp.), Apiaceae, and Filipendula ulmaria. These pollen types constituted 90.8 % (1977) and 90.3 % (1978) of all the pollen examined. Between 1960—1963 and 1977—1978 the average proportion of Brassicaceae pollen has risen, while the proportion of T. repens + T. hybridum pollen has decreased, evidently due to the changes in agricultural practices. The seasonal variation in the pollen spectrum was explained by the weather conditions. Regionally characteristic pollen spectra were not found, although Brassicaceae pollen was typical of the honeys of agricultural zones I and II, due to cultivation of Brassica oilseed crops in those regions. The positive correlation of the proportion of Brassicaceae pollen with the total pollen count is discussed in connection with the problem of determining the botanical origin.",

One group was kept in confinement with ad libitum grass silage within each experiment. The other group had ad libitum grass silage indoors and they were put out on grass pasture during part of the 24 hour period, 12 hours (night, Experiment 1) and 6 hours (day, Experiment 2) in June, July and August. In Experiment 2, the concentrate (9 kg d-1) was given at two crude protein levels: high crude protein [185 g kg-1 dry matter (DM)] and low crude protein (135 g kg-1 DM). In Experiment 1, night-time grazing increased total DM intake and milk (3.9 kg d-1) production. There was interaction between month and forage feeding strategy, the difference in milk yield being smallest between treatments in June. In Experiment 2, day-time grazing had no significant main effect on milk production but there was significant interaction between month and forage feeding strategy showing 2.5 kg d-1 difference between treatments in July. High-protein concentrate tended to increase the milk yield more on the silage diet compared with the group grazing during daytime. .The differences in milk yield between the forage feeding treatments were mainly due to the higher dry matter intake and higher metabolizable energy content of the pasture grass compared with silage. The lower milk responses to concentrate crude protein in the cows grazing during daytime compared with the silage group indicate a high protein value of pasture grass. It is concluded that part-time grazing increases the milk yield and decreases the need for supplementary concentrate protein.;",

The acid sulphate soils (located under farmland) had a large impact on the stream as indicated by pH values occasionally down to 4.0, moderately to strongly increased concentrations of inorganic solutes, and a high acid SO4 2- load characterised by negative d34S(sulphate) values. In addition, the forested areas underlain mainly with till and peat released low SO4 2- but low pH waters (down to at least 4.6) during high flows, indicating the importance of humic acids in controlling the pH. These humic acids flocculated abundantly in the middle/ lower reaches as a result of interaction with acid sulphate water. Therefore, not only the farmland acid sulphate soils but also the organic-rich soils/horizons in the forested areas contribute to water-quality deterioration.;",

The results were compared with the analytical data obtained from three soil samples incubated in a prolonged liming experiment. The resin extraction method proved more effective than the water extraction method. The amounts of P desorbed by both methods seemed to increase exponentially as the pH in the soil suspensions rose. The factors involved were discussed. On the basis of fractionation analyses P reacting to changes in the pH and participating in desorption processes was supposed to originate from secondary NH4F and NaOH soluble reserves. In general, as the acidity decreased NH4F-P increased at the expense of NaOH-P. In heavily limed gyttja soil also H2SO4-P increased. This was possibly induced by the precipitation of mobilized P as a Ca compound. The significance of pH in the extractability of soil P seemed somewhat to lessen as the amount of secondary P increased. The results were in accordance with the conception that liming improves the availability of inorganic P to plants and reduces the need for P fertilization. However, increasing of the soil pH involves the risk that P is more easily desorbed to the recipient water by the eroded soil material carried into the watercourse. Therefore, intensive liming is not recommendable close to the shoreline. Further, it should be taken into account that liming of lakes may also result in eutrophication as desorption of sedimentary inorganic P is enhanced.",

The microstructure of native, germinated, autoclaved and extruded grains of the hulled cv. Veli and hull-less cv. Lisbeth was examined by light microscopy, the texture was measured by determining the milling energy and hardness of the grains and sensory characteristics were evaluated with descriptive sensory profile analysis. In cv. Veli the cells of the starchy endosperm were smaller than in cv. Lisbeth and ß-glucan was concentrated in the subaleurone layer. In cv. Lisbeth ß-glucan was evenly distributed in the starchy endosperm. The grains of cv. Lisbeth were more extensively modified in the germination process than the grains of cv. Veli, otherwise the effects of processing on the grains of the two cultivars were similar. Germination caused cell wall degradation, autoclaving and extrusion cooking caused starch gelatinization. Autoclaving resulted in the hardest perceived texture in oat. Gelatinization of starch appeared to contribute more to the hardness of oat groats than the cell wall structure. Of the instrumental methods used in this study the milling energy measurement appeared to be the most useful method for the analysis of the effects of processing on grain structure.;",

Variables with significant relationships in correlation analysis both before and after difference detrending were further investigated using forward stepwise regression. For rye, March snow depth, and June and July solar radiation accounted for 66% of the year-to-year variance in hectolitre weight, and for winter wheat January snow depth, June solar radiation and August temperature accounted for 62% of the interannual variance in hectolitre weight. Further analysis of national variety trials and weather station data was used to support proposed biological mechanisms. Finally a cross validation technique was used to test forecast models with those variables available by early July by making predictions of above or below the mean hectolitre weight. Analysis of the contingency tables for these predictions indicated that national hectolitre weight forecasts are feasible for both cereals in advance of harvest.;",

The levels of the carbohydrate supplements were 15 % and 30 % of the dry matter of the daily rations, representing 2 1/2 and 5 g/kg animal live weight per day. The silages were prepared with three different preservatives: 1) AIV I solution (25 % formic acid and 20 % hydrochloric acid), 2) formic acid and 3) Viher solution (26 %formic acid and 70 % formalin). The total number of ciliates was highest in the animals receiving sucrose with the silage, lower in those given starch and lowest in those given cellulose. On the pure silage diet, it was between those for the starch and cellulose diets. The total number of bacteria decreased in the opposite direction on the different diets. The sucrose supplements increased the numbers of small ciliates especially and the cellulose supplements those of the bigger ciliates. The total volume of the ciliate fauna was thus highest in the animals on cellulose diets, lower in those on starch diets and lowest in those on sucrose diets. The total microbe mass constituted the following percentages of the rumen content on the different diets: only silage 4.1, 15 % sucrose 3.5, 30 % sucrose 3.5, 15 % starch 4.0, 30 % starch 4.5, 15% cellulose 4.6 and 30 % cellulose 5.2. Bacteria constituted 77—86 % of the total microbe mass on the different diets, the precentage being highest on the sucrose diets and lowest on the cellulose diets. Only small differences were found between the different silage preservatives in the effect on the rumen microbiota.",

The consumers evaluated five cultivars each, including the control cultivar Aroma. Each cultivar was scored for appearance, texture, juiciness, taste and overall impression by a minimum of 100 consumers in 2002 and by 200 in 2003. All quality attributes were positively correlated when calculations were performed across all consumer scores, with overall impression and taste having the strongest association. Rubinola and K:1160 emerged as the best liked cultivars overall. Cultivar means were analysed for relationships with some previously scored or measured variables and with consumer profile data. Positive correlations with overall impression were obtained for amount of red colour in 2002, and for sugar levels in 2003. Among consumer profile variables, age had the largest influence on consumer scores, with some indications that older consumers preferred (or at least tolerated) soft-fleshed cultivars better than did younger consumers. Minimum number of consumers needed to obtain reliable results was determined by computer simulations indicating that the error rate became stabilized already with 50 consumers.;",

Crop yields of grain and straw are given in Table 2. Low addition of the metal (50 mg/pot) has had slight or no effect on the yield size. The high rate of metal (250 mg/ pot) of some of the metals has induced definite to heavy yield reductions. Nickel has led to a heavy yield decrease in all soil series both in grain and straw afterlight liming. The yield reduction is to a certain extent or completely eliminated after heavier liming. Mercury has induced a near complete crop failure in the sandy soil series at both lime rates. Some yield reduction is obvious also in the other soil series, in clay soil only after light liming. Cadmium has reduced the straw yields in peat soil after both lime rates. Clay soil shows grain yield reduction at heaviest liming, while no yield reduction is detectable in the sandy soil. Cobalt has induced some degree of yield reduction in all soil types, most of all in clay soil after light liming. Lead has had no effect on the yield size. The heavy metal content in the crop is presented in Table 3. Apart from lead, the relative content increases very heavily with increased metal application. The content at times proves essentially higher in the crop from peat soil and sandy soil than in crop from clay soil. The content of cadmium, nickel and cobalt is lower at heavy liming compared to light liming. This is particularly characteristic of the crop from clay soil and sandy soil. The effect of heavier liming on the mercury and lead uptake is equivocal. For nickel, the relative content is essentially higher in the grain than in straw. The content of other metals is higher in the straw. The lead content in particular is much higher in straw than in the grain. In addition to the crop experiment, all treatments have included one parallel pot without plants. At the harvesting time, samples were taken from these pots for chemical analysis. The heavy metal content was determined after extraction by an AL-solution (Table 4). Wide variations appear between metals and soil types with regard to the recovered amounts of applied metal. Mercury shows a characteristically low AL-soluble recovery, only 1 to 2 per cent at the highest application rate. Also of lead, only a small amount of the applied substance exists as AL-soluble. With regard to the remaining metals, nearly all have been recovered as AL-soluble by a heavy application of cadmium to sandy soil at light liming. In other cases the percentage recovery falls within the 20—70 range, the lower figures often pertaining to clay soil and the higher ones to peat soil. A description of plants influenced by retarded growth, and symptoms of toxicity, are given.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the relation between the local numbers and distribution of autumn staging Eurasian Cranes (Grus grus Linn.) and agricultural land use during recent decades in Estonia. The analysis is based on the long-term monitoring data of staging cranes and the statistical data of land use in Estonia. We found that great changes in cropping area, as well as in crane numbers have taken place in Estonia since the 1960s. We also found a significant positive correlation between crane numbers and the cropping area of summer wheat, winter wheat, winter rye and all cereals together, and a negative correlation with the area of potatoes. Generally, arable land, particularly that used for growing cereals, has a great influence on the local numbers and distribution of staging cranes. Based on our findings, we predict that changes in the local numbers and distribution of Eurasian Cranes staging during their migration in Estonia and elsewhere will depend on changes in agricultural land use in staging areas, rather than on the size of the breeding population. As about 10 percent of the European Eurasian Crane population stop over in Estonia during the autumn migration, the country has an important role to play in the protection of the species.;",

WR is commonly recognized in the soils of warm and temperate climates. To explore the occurrence of WR in soils in Finland, soil R index was studied on 12 sites of different soil types. The effects of soil management practice, vegetation age, soil moisture and drying temperature on WR were studied by a mini-infiltrometer with samples from depths of 0-5 and 5-10 cm. All studied sites exhibited WR (R index &gt;1.95) at the time of sampling. WR increased as follows: sand (R = 1.8-5.0) &lt; clay (R = 2.4-10.3) &lt; organic (R = 7.9-undefined). At clay and sand, WR was generally higher at the soil surface and at the older sites (14 yr.), where organic matter is accumulated. Below 41 vol. % water content these mineral soils were water repellent whereas organic soil exhibited WR even at saturation. These results show that soil WR also reduces water infiltration at the prevalent field moisture regime in the soils of boreal climate. The ageing of vegetation increases WR and on the other hand, cultivation reduces or hinders the development of WR.;",

CM mainly intensified the reddening of sausage cuts and increased monounsaturated acids in fat. Acceptance was also better for CM, although odour and flavour were only slightly improved.

The study was carried out with 75 fatteners (30.100 kg body weight), divided into three groups, of 25 pigs each. The control group was given a basal diet that contained 85 mg/kg of Fe from premix. A L-carnitine group was given a basal diet supplemented with 100 mg/kg of L-carnitine, and a L-carnitine+Fe group was given a basal diet supplemented with 100 mg/kg of L-carnitine and 60 mg/kg of Fe from a Fe-AA complex. The supplement of L-carnitine to the diets did not have any effects on the growth performance and carcass traits. The L-carnitine supplement decreased the concentration of triglycerides (p.0.05), cholesterol (p .0.05) and low-density lipoproteins (p .0.01) in the blood serum of pigs, while it increased (p.0.01) the concentration of high-density lipoproteins. The combination of L-carnitine+Fe increased the growth performance of growing pigs (p .0.05) and the lean percentage and fatless ham weight in carcass and also increased (p .0.05) the Fe content in the blood serum and the longissimus dorsi muscle of pigs. The results suggest the more effective outcomes can be reached when L-carnitine+Fe rather than only L-carnitine is used in diets.;",

The sum of the cell-wall constituents thus determined was subsequently compared with Paloheimo’s membrane substances and crude fibre. Large variations in the cell-wall composition were found between different plant materials. Furthermore, there were large differences in the solubility of the cell-wall substances of different plant materials in the hydrolysing procedures used in determinations of membrane substances and crude fibre. The hemicellulose composition of different species in the same genus and even in the same family was found to be similar in definite plant parts and at definite growth stages.

It was hypothesized that interspecific competition will change the response of the investigated plants to increased [CO2] and temperature. The obtained results showed that in the current climate conditions, a higher biomass and photosynthetic rate and a lower antioxidant activity were detected for barley grown under interspecific competition effect. While in the warmed climate and under competition conditions opposite results were detected: a higher water use efficiency, a higher photosynthetic performance, a lower dissipated energy flux and a lower antioxidant enzymes activity were detected for barnyard grass plants. This study highlights that in the future climate conditions, barnyard grass will become more efficient in performance of the photosynthetic apparatus and it will suffer from lower oxidative stress caused by interspecific competition as compared to barley.",

Overall there was no statistically significant effect on 1000 grain weight and a slightly negative effect on grain test weight. Nitrogen fertilizer increased N uptake much more steeply in slightly acidic soils (SA, pH 5.8–6.9), located mostly in South Finland, than in moderately acidic soils (MA, pH 5.0–5.7), located in Central Finland. With increasing N rates, protein content increased to a larger extent in spring barley and oats than in spring wheat.

The lower differences are expressed by higher ITSF value, whereas the index values range from 0 to 1. Data collected in 38 dairy farms (with tie-stall and freestall housing systems) were used for the ITSF index analyses. The ITSF index values for the two compared housing systems were calculated for measurements carried out in four zones in each barn: lying, social, feeding and milking areas. There were higher average ITSF index values for the freestall system than for the tie-stall housing system across all investigated zones included in the barns. Investigations can support farmers to improve some conditions of dairy production in the barns including consciousness of some standards on dairy facilities and cow comfort.",

Crossbreds produced milk with higher milk fat and protein contents than HF cows, but ECM yield did not differ between genotypes.

With moderate lighting (170 W m-2 above rows, 60 W m-2 inter-row) in a ventilated greenhouse, seasonal electricity and heat use (MJ kg-1 cucumber) were 20–50 and 10–25, 17–30 and 3–8, 38–55 and 10–18 in spring, summer and autumn to mid-winter, respectively. In summer, a semi-closed greenhouse improved energy use efficiency by 20–30% and split-root fertigation by 0–15%. Raising light intensity and applying inter- row lighting allowed higher yields in autumn to mid-winter without affecting electricity use efficiency. In other seasons, increasing the lighting decreased the efficiency. The emissions largely resulted from electricity use. Direct emissions (kg CO2-eq kg-1) based on propane and electricity from the national grid were 2.5, 1.5 and 3.3 in spring, summer and autumn to mid-winter, respectively. Efficiency of using solar and supplemental PAR was markedly lower in summer than in other seasons. The results provide profile of energy use and emissions and point to ways to reduce them.",

This study was designed to complement such investigations with novel understanding from high latitude conditions. Four experiments were designed to characterise seed loss at harvest, persistence, viability and capacity for volunteer seedling establishment, as well as impact of management measures on soil seed bank dynamics. Oilseed rape was the primary crop investigated due to the availability of GM cultivars and because of the increasing importance. Harvest losses and soil seed bank development were significant. Volunteer seedlings emerged at reasonably high rates, especially in the first autumn after harvest, but about 10% of buried seeds maintained their viability for at least three years. Soil incorporation methods had no major effect on numbers of volunteer seedlings, but herbicide treatments controlled volunteer seedlings efficiently, though not completely, due to irregular timing of seedling emergence.",

Both models constructed frontiers where: i) the rankings of farms according to efficiency were positively and highly correlated and ii) the size and the significance of the parameter estimates were similar. Input-saving technologies were found to be positively influenced by livestock density, pasture availability and the use of coupled income support. Larger farms, farms with higher specialisation in beef cattle, farms with a larger number of animals older than 2 years, farms converting to organic production, farms located in less favoured areas and farms located in regions with a shorter grazing period were found be less efficient.",

Six broiler flocks were reared per year with an average of 26 000 birds per flock. Heating constituted the major energy input, averaging 1.3 kWh kg-1 of carcass weight. It varied greatly between seasons and was highest during the cold period. Using renewable energy for heating remarkably reduces CO2 emissions compared to fossil energy. Electricity consumption averaged 0.08 kWh kg-1 of carcass weight. The greatest energy saving potential can be found in heating. CO2 emissions can be lowered to similar levels as in warmer countries by using biofuels for heating. Ventilation control is one possibility for direct energy savings in broiler production. Feed production is one of the key elements when total energy consumption is considered.",

In these trials ammonium nitrate limestone and calcium nitrate were, at several rates, applied as surface dressing. It was found that not only the ammonium nitrogen but also the nitrate nitrogen applied to the surface of loam, silt, silt clay, and fine sand clay soils tended to remain in the top inch for a considerable period in the absence of heavy rainfalls or a longer wet period. The plants appeared rapidly to deplete the layers downwards from 1 inch, but even after six and eight weeks from the application of the fertilizers the ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen contents of the surface inch could be markedly higher in the treated plots than in the untreated ones. In the non-cropped soil, eight weeks after the application of the fertilizers, the mineral nitrogen content of the top inch corresponded to about 60 % of the nitrogen applied. On the basis of these results the working in or placement of nitrogen fertilizers seems to be profitable. Fixation of ammonium nitrogen in unexchangeable forms was observed in some of the trials. This, however, did not significantly impair the value of ammonium nitrate limestone as a nitrogen source in these trials.",

Samples were used from a field trial in which superphosphate had been annually applied for 35 years in amounts of 0, 100, 200, and 300 kg/ha, resp. Analyses were performed on samples of four layers: 0 to 10 cm, 10 to 20 cm, 40 to 50 cm, and 60 to 70 cm. It was found that the mineral nitrogen (NH4-N + NO3-N) content of the soil samples collected late in the autumn was in all layers highest in the plots treated with the highest amount of superphosphate. The positive effect of the treatment with 200 kg/ha of superphosphate reached down to the layer of 40 to 50 cm. In the soil treated with 100 kg/ha the mineral nitrogen content was higher than in the untreated soil only in both surface layers. In the incubation experiment of five and ten weeks the differences in the mineral nitrogen content were equalized, particularly in the samples from deeper layers. In the top layers the superiority of the heaviest treatment was maintained. The amounts of nitrogen in the hay yields harvested in the previous summer appeared, generally, to be the higher the larger the amounts of superphosphate applied. It seemed to be probable that potassium was a minimum factor in the plots of the heaviest superphosphate treatment. Comparison of the present results with data obtained from the same experiment when it had been only run for five years indicated that, in regard to the availability of nitrogen in this peat soil, the slight tendency found thirty years ago had grown to the distinct superiority of the heavy superphosphate treatment.",

The use of organic soils in food production is a complex and politically driven issue, thus multistakeholder and participatory approaches to policy development, implementation and evaluation are essential. This study is integrating qualitative and quantitative methods in an iterative process to produce action-oriented knowledge for supporting actions to sustainably manage peatlands and reduce the enormous greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural peatlands. This study has engaged inter-disciplinary researchers and transdisciplinary actors in the Finnish food system via farmers, regional and ministry officials, food industry representatives along with education and research representatives to produce action-oriented knowledge for sustainability. The results indicate that actions are needed to develop a shared understanding between relevant actors and stakeholders in the food system to create activities and effective policy measures to remove peatlands from active production in Finland. Therefore, there is a necessity to identify and define incentives from both the public and private sectors to remove peatlands from food production, and thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Interventions that account for local, regional, and national perspectives should be co-created among the inter-disciplinary researchers and transdisciplinary actors in the food system to generate transformative and system-wide change in the transition towards a low-carbon society.",

Treatments included oxo-biodegradable mulch film and no mulch, and three harvest times (the latter only in Helsinki). Mulch film increased DM yield on average by 2.3 Mg ha-1 in Helsinki and by 3.8 Mg ha-1 in Maaninka. Mulch film had a minor effect on the quality, and overall, the quality improved, although DM yield accumulation had already ceased. Nevertheless, the starch contents fluctuated and remained mostly below the target rate – 300 g kg-1 DM – especially in Central Finland. The results indicate that mulch film improves forage maize yield, but a late harvest is still required to improve forage quality. However, climate conditions still restrict starch accumulation to ears in Northern European climate conditions, especially in the important milk production area in Central Finland.",

Increased cutting frequency lowered the total dry matter yields of all plant species. Production of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis L.) swards was significantly reduced by taking four or five cuts instead of one or two cuts. Meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) and meadow grass (Poa pratensis L.) showed only a minor interaction with harvesting regimes and were less affected by the cutting frequency. The increased cutting frequency raised the crude protein content, this causing the highest protein yields despite the smaller dry matter yields. The inclusion of red clover in seed mixtures had a favourable effect on the crude protein content of grass swards. Stands of sown plants decreased and the proportion of weeds in yields increased with time, reflecting the suitability of plant species to various cutting regimes. Meadow fescue and meadow grass with rapid regrowth had a positive effect on sward density and also caused less invasion of weeds when the cutting frequency was increased.",

The observed values of reproducibility (95% probability) of soil P determination were 42-61% of the mean P concentration for three soils. This approximately corresponds to a maximum error of one P class in a seven-step classification system. Soil texture and organic matter content are used as secondary variables in P fertilization planning. In commercial soil testing these are both determined by finger assessment and the results have significant errors in most laboratories. Erroneous texture determinations are more likely to lead to errors in P fertilizer recommendations than soil P analysis itself. In this study the largest deviation from a correct P fertilization recommendation was +10 kg ha-1. In soil sampling simulation, stratified random sampling in areas of differing texture gave the most consistent results with geostatistical analysis of the soil test data, as compared with random, systematic, and judgment sampling strategies.;",

    "abstract": "The annual cycle of growth of many temperate grasses is limited by low temperatures during the winter and spring and water stress during the summer. Climate change, induced by increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, can affect the growth and community structure of temperate grasslands in two ways. The first is directly through changes in atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the second is indirectly through changes in temperature and rainfall. At higher latitudes, where growth is largely temperature limited, it is probable that the direct effects of enhanced CO2 will be less than at low latitudes. However, interactions with increasing temperature and water stress are complex. Temperate grasslands range from intensively managed monocultures of sown species to species rich natural and semi-natural communities whose local distributions are controlled by variations in soil type and drainage. The different species can show marked differences in their responses to increasing CO2 concentrations, rising temperatures and water stress. This will probably result in major alterations in the community structure of temperate grasslands in the future. In addition to impacts on primary productivity and community structure, a long-term effect of elevated CO2 on grasslands is likely to be a significant increase in soil carbon storage. However, this may be counteracted by increases in temperature.",

Two-year experiments investigated the effects of three NPK fertiliser levels (N 50, 100, 125/150 kg/ha), with and without irrigation, on yield, advancement of maturity, storage losses and shelf life. High fertilisation advanced maturity but irrigation had no effect. High fertilisation increased yield only in 1996 (5B7%), but irrigation increased the yield noticeably: by 33.5% in 1995 and 8.5% in 1996. There was no interaction between fertilisation and irrigation. The low fertilisation optimum is attributed to the mineralisation of soil nitrogen, as the soil was rich in organic matter. At the low fertilisation level, plants took up twice as much nitrogen as present in the fertiliser, and with increased fertilisation the nitrogen uptake increased markedly. The foliage nitrogen content was low, evidently as a result of late harvesting. Treatments had only a minor effect on the storage performance and shelf life of onions. The results suggest that fertilisation rates could be reduced in onion production. Irrigation during warm and dry periods is essential to achieve the maximum yield potential and does not impair the storage quality of onions.;",

Compaction of organic soil low in P increased P and K contents and uptake by carrot roots and shoots. In severely compacted clay soil, the nutrient use decreased by increasing soil compactness. NO3-N contents were the highest in early season (25-30 mg kg-1 fresh matter) and decreased with advancing season. In loam, NO3-N content was increased by irrigation or loosening. Increasing the N fertilisation of organic soil from 30 kg ha-1 to 60 kg ha-1 increased the NO3-N content 30%. Soil type and its nutrient status, weather conditions, and growth stage had much more significant influence on the P, K, and Mg contents of carrots than soil treatments.",

Rimmed tin boxes were used to collect seed from shattered pods. They were placed between the continuous rows before pods started to shatter. The shed seeds were collected two to three times a week. Susceptibility and timing of pod shattering varies between spring turnip rape and rape. However, before optimal harvest date spring rape does not shatter significantly more than spring turnip rape. Spring rape starts to shatter more compared with spring turnip rape after its optimal harvest date. It is also more sensitive to weather conditions than spring turnip rape. Furthermore, pod shattering after optimal harvest time differs among years. Weather conditions are discussed as one possible cause of pod shattering",

    "abstract": "Reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinacea L., is a relatively new biomass crop in northern Europe, which produces raw material for bioenergy and paper pulp. Breeding reed canary grass for industrial purposes is under way in the absence of domestic cultivars being available. Knowledge of the extent of variation in biomass related traits is a basic requirement of the breeding programme. The aim of this study was to describe variation in biomass related traits and evaluate the relationships among the variables. Field experiment was carried out between 1994 and 1998 in Finland. Research material included wild and elite populations, which were divided into ten groups according to their origin. Biomass yield, plant fractions, shoot number, node number, leaf area and overwintering ability were measured. Panicle number, plant height and seed ripening were included to the analyses of the relationships. Results indicated the high biomass yield potential of reed canary grass, reaching over 13 t DM ha-1 in the fourth year after establishment. Elite material and a local group from southern Finland had the highest biomass yield, whereas the northernmost local group had the lowest. Three factors established accounted for 45% of the variance and they were defined as high biomass yield, leaf-shoot relationship and fast development. The first factor indicated positive connections among biomass yield, panicle number, plant height, straw fraction and node fraction. This study indicated variation in agronomic traits of reed canary grass, which enables breeding of new cultivars with desired trait combinations.;",

The animals were fitted with cannulae in the rumen and in the proximal duodenum. A diet of grass silage, barley and rapeseed meal (445, 445 and 90 g/kg total dry matter (DM)) was fed, with and without addition of 10 g per day of yeast culture (YC), in two treatment sequences. The addition of YC had no effect on the mean values of rumen pH, ammonia N concentration or molar proportions of volatile fatty acids. Also, the postprandial changes in rumen fermentation pattern were similar when the diet did and did not contain the YC supplement. The peak concentration of lactic acid 1 h after feeding tended to be higher in cattle receiving the YC diet (13.9 v 6.0 mmol/l). Apparent digestibility of organic matter (OM) (mean 0.780) and the proportion of OM digestion occurring in the rumen (mean 0.603) were not affected by YC. Likewise, there was no effect on rumen or total digestion of cell wall carbohydrates, and the results for the degradation of hay DM in the rumen and for particle-associated carboxymethylcellulase and xylanase activities indicated that YC had no effect on the rumen environment that could affect fibre digestion. Supplemental yeast did not affect the rate of microbial N synthesis (28.0 and 28.6 g/kg OM apparently digested in the rumen). The results indicate that the addition of YC to the diet is not likely to improve the efficiency of digestion and fermentation in the rumen of cattle given a diet based on grass silage and barley.",

The complete assembly consists of six culture vessels (liquid volume 700 ml) fed twice daily with finely ground feed. The artificial saliva enters the vessel continuously, and the effluent leaves it continuously through the overflow port. The intermittent stirring of the fermentor content and the pH regulation are automatically controlled by a desktop computer. Two replicate experiments with ten fermentors given a diet of silage (50 %) and barley (50 %) were made in order to evaluate the system. The results indicate that the system reaches steady-state conditions within three to five days, ammonia concentration being an exeption. It takes for the ammonia concentration approximately 11—14 days to stabilize. The plateau values for the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, the molar proportions of individual VFAs, and the ammonia concentrations were found to be within the accepted range in the rumen of animals given similar diets or in other artificial rumen systems. There was a tenfold decrease in the numbers of protozoa in the fermentors during the first four days of incubation. However, the average plateau value for the protozoa numbers (2.5 x 104/ml) is in the same range as in the dual flow continuous culture systems. The efficiency of the microbial N production was higher than that usually observed in vivo or in vitro (45 vs. 30 g/kg organic matter digested). The results indicate that this continuous culture system provides a reasonable estimate of rumen fermentation.",

Earthworms were sampled during the three last years of the seven year experiment. Samples were taken with formalin in the autumns of 1986 and 1987 (one replicate of the experiment) and in that of 1988 with formalin and by taking soil-cores (all three replicates). Aporreclodea caliginosa (Sav.) was dominant in all cropping systems. The rest of the identified individuals were Lumbricus rubellus (Hoff.) and L. lerrestris (L.). A few L. castaneus (Sav.) were also found. There were no clear differences in the species composition between the conventional and organic cropping systems. Application of slurry caused a drop in the proportion of Lumbricus. Low total numbers were observed in 1987, possibly due to high winter mortality. In 1988, the average number (and SE) of earthworms was 23 (11.2) - 92 (49.8) ind. m-2 and their total dry weight 1.0 (0.54) - 3.2 (1.53) g m-2. The average number of cocoons in 1988 ranged from 5 (2.5) to 52.5 (26.3) coc. m-2. The highest abundances of earthworms and cocoons were observed in the organically cultivated vetch ley. The differences between the treatments in worm abundance were not statistically discernible. The mean size (mg dwt) of juvenile and adult A. caliginosa was similar in different cropping systems. The abundance patterns of earthworms differed in the replicates. This was related to the confounding effects of local water-logging and soil compaction in the field. Consistent differences in the soil conditions of the cropping systems resulting from the activity of earthworms are unlikely.",

    "abstract": "In Finnish natural populations, arctic bramble proved uniformly self-incompatible. In vigorous and richly flowering populations, the intensity of fruit set is governed by the number of incompatibility classes present. Most non-fruiting populations contain only one incompatibility class (and most likely only one clone) and therefore totally lack compatible pollen. Richly fruiting populations usually contain at least three incompatibility classes. A clone with an estimated size of 80 metres and age of 160 years was found. This supports the vegetative burst explanation for the “sudden appearance” of arctic bramble populations. For the purposes of plant breeding, a large genetic collection is required. In cultivation, a thorough mixture of at least three varieties is recommended. The study was dynamically optimized. A computerized guidance system was constructed, which analyzed the accumulating results and yielded recommendations for forthcoming crosses. For the analysis into equivalence classes of incompatibility, a stepwise clustering algorithm of the single move type, based on the maximum likelihood principle, was introduced. This partitioning was based on the number of seeds in a cross, considering it as a stochastic variable. Seed number probability distributions in intraclass and interclass pollinations were acquired utilizing non-parametric density estimation. Finally, both incompatibility class and seed probability estimates were adjusted together iteratively. A recommendation algorithm was produced, based on a partially heuristic principle of maximum lability maximum stability. With the aid of the guidance system, incompatibility classes could be resolved using about one tenth of the number of crosses required in a conventional system.",

Surveys were done in 20022003 in 119 conventionally cropped fields and 64 fields under organic cropping. Herbicides were applied to 92% of conventionally cropped fields where they provided relatively good control but were costly. Weeds were controlled mechanically only in five fields under organic production. A total of 76 weed species were recorded, of which 29 exceeded the 10% frequency level of occurrence. The average number of weed species per field was 10 under conventional cropping and 18 under organic cropping. The most frequent weed species in both cropping practices were Chenopodium album, Stellaria media and Viola arvensis. Elymus repens was the most frequent grass species. The difference in species composition under conventional and organic cropping was detected with Redundancy Analysis. Under conventional cropping, features of crop stand and weed control explained 38.7% and 37.6% of the variation respectively. Under organic cropping the age of crop stand and field location (y co-ordinate) respectively explained best the variation. Weeds could be efficiently managed with herbicides under conventional cropping, but they represented a significant problem for organic production. Mixed cultivation of pea with cereals is recommended, particularly for organic cropping, as it favours crop competition against weeds.;",

For the incubation, 40 ml of culture medium (53% buffer, 45% frozen ileal digesta, and 2% fresh faeces) was dispensed in vessels containing 5 ml of buffer, 0.5 g of feed, and 20 ìl of liquid or 20 mg of solid acidifiers. Gas production was measured every 15 min during the 24 h incubation at 39°C, and a Gompertz bacterial growth model was applied to the gas production data. Formic acid was the only acid that reduced the maximum rate of gas production (ìm) compared to that in the control treatment (P &lt; 0.05). The ìm was slower in vessels with formic acid than in those with calcium formate, citric acid, and potassium sorbate (P &lt; 0.05) Calcium formate increased the ìm compared to the control treatment (P &lt; 0.05). The maximum volume of gas produced and the lag time did not differ between different acidifiers (P &gt; 0.05). When investigating formic-acid-based mixtures that contained 15% of potassium sorbate and/or sodium benzoate, the estimated parameters for the Gompertz growth model did not differ from those for treatments with plain formic acid (P &gt; 0.05). However, concentrations of total volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid, and n-butyric acid were reduced by all the mixtures (P &lt; 0.05), but not by plain formic acid (P &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, organic acids and salts were found to differ in their ability to modulate microbial fermentation in the digestive tract of piglets. Mixing formic acid with potassium sorbate or sodium benzoate changed fermentation patterns, and the possibility to use them to enhance the antimicrobial effect of formic acid should be investigated further in vivo.;",

The effect of seed mixture (alsike clover, red clover, white clover, white and alsike clover or grass mixture), year (1996, 1997 and 1998) and grazing period (5 per grazing season) on pre- and post-grazing herbage mass (HM), botanical and chemical composition of pregrazing HM and post-grazing sward height was assessed. The nutritive value of herbage for milk production was also considered. Seed mixtures resulted in different pre-grazing HM and post-grazing sward heights, but similar pre- minus post-grazing HM. Compared with other mixtures, the proportion of clover was higher for white clover based mixtures. The white clover mixture had the highest crude protein content and lowest concentrations of cellulose and hemicellulose. In addition to seed mixture, the effect of year and grazing period on measured parameters was significant, highlighting the importance of grazing management. Moderate pasture herbage production of relative high nutritive value was achieved under organic practices, but the supply and nutritive value of herbage was variable and, in some cases, unable to meet the requirements of lactating dairy cows. The proportion of clover in all seed mixtures decreased year on year, and was subject to seasonal variations that altered the nutritional value of herbage.

Wiltshire was the most common pathogen, being more common on cabbage than on any of the other plant species. 91 % of the white cabbage and red cabbage seed lots were infected. The mean A. brassicicola contents of the infected seed lots were 29.5 % and 30.6 %. Plenodomus lingam (Tode ex Fr.) Höhnel occurred in 10 % of the white cabbage and 27 % of the red cabbage seed lots, the fungus content varying from 0.5 % to 14 %. The fungus was also found on cauliflower, swede and radish. Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc. was found in 4 % of the cabbage and in 31 % of the rape seed lots at fungus contents of 0.5—6.5 %. Alternaria raphani Groves &amp; Skolko was found in 30 % of the radish and black radish seed lots at fungus contents of 0.5—8 %. The following fungi were also found on the seeds of Cruciferous plants: Pleospora herbarum (Pers.) Rabenh., Whetzelinia sclerotiorum (Lib) Korf &amp; Dumont, Botrytis cinerea Pers., Ulocladium concortiale (Thum.) Simmons, Fusarium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani Kühn as well as 18 fungus genera and species either saprophytic or pathogenic to other plants. When the Alternaria brassicicola content of the seeds was 20 % it caused 10 % damping-off damage on the sand substrate. A similar level of damage occurred on the peat substrate when the fungus content reached 70 %. In addition to causing damping off and damaging the seedlings, the fungus also slowed-down seedling growth without apparently damaging them. When the seedlings were grown at a lower temperature the amount of damage caused by A. brassicicola was much less than that which occurred when a higher temperature was used. Plenodomus lingam caused as much damping-off as there were seeds infected with the fungi. Other seed-borne fungi had no importance in seedling raising. Sphagnum fuscum peat, which is used in Finland as a growth substrate, reduced the amount of damping-off caused by seed-borne fungi in comparison to disinfected substrates and prevented the spread of A. brassicicola and P. lingam from diseased to healthy seeds. Dressing the seeds with thiram proved to be very effective against A. brassicicola.",

    "abstract": "By means of theoretical calculations and laboratory experiments, this study attempted to elucidate the effects of excessive and of inadequate soil moisture on the germination and seedling emergence of sugar beet. The results of this study confirmed the opinion that water contained in the sugar beet seed or surrounding the seed as a water film is a barrier to the adequate intake of oxygen by the seed only when the value of the water potential is close to zero. The soil water potential at which the passage of oxygen into the seed is prevented depends largely on the structure of the seed bed. With a semi-permeable membrane of cellulose acetate and a solution of polyethylene glycol, it was shown that the sugar beet seed will still germinate fairly well at a potential of —10 atm, but at —13 atm germination is slight. The soil water potential appeared to have nearly the same effect on germination as did the water potential of the polyethylene glycol solution. The seedling emergence percentage was, however, smaller than the germination percentage in experiments with the semi-permeable membrane. This was considered to be caused by the slow extension growth of the radicle due to a low water potential, at the stage of seedling emergence. According to studies made, the initial water intake of the sugar beet seed planted in soil is rapid. Poor contact between the seed and the soil slows down water intake and seedling emergence, but does not impair the final seedling emergence. Removal of the fruit coat was shown to improve germination markedly when the water potential is low. This treatment would have little practical significance, since the growth of the radicle at a low water potential is very slow.",

A procedure for extracting sulphur from soil samples with ammonium acetate (pH 4.65), the interference of the organic matter being reduced by oxidation of the extract with H2O2, was proposed. Sulphur balance in Finnish cultivated soils was estimated by taking into account the average amounts of emitted (8 kg S/ha/yr.), precipitated (8 kg S/ha/yr.) and leached (8 kg S/ha/yr.) sulphur. The actual situation in the cultivated soils seems thus to be depending, on an average, on the uptake by plants and the sulphur applied (12 kg S/ha/yr. in the early 1970s). In 104 samples of cultivated soil, the content of total sulphur showed a slight correlation with the content of organic carbon. The amounts of sulphur extracted in various ways were not predictable by means of the soil characteristics used (pHCaCl2, org. C and texture). Extracted sulphur did not correlate sufficiently with the development and sulphur uptake of plants. Under field conditions in northern Finland, sulphur application produced a relatively distinct result in respect both to the ley yields on Carex peat, and their sulphur content. On mineral soils in southern Finland the yields were unaffected by supplementary fertilization with sulphur. In the pot experiments performed a fairly close relationship between sulphur and nitrogen was demonstrated.",

To estimate environmental effects of recurrent slurry applications, a 5-year field study was performed to compare nitrogen (N) losses to water and ammonia losses to air by volatilization, when cattle slurry was either surface broadcast or injected into clay soil after grass cuttings. Slurry was spread on the grass in summer (19961997) or both in summer and autumn (19982000). Biomass N uptake before grass harvesting and amount of soil mineral N in spring and autumn were measured and field N balances were calculated. Despite cool weather, up to one third of the ammonium N of broadcast slurries was lost through ammonia volatilization after application in autumn, but injection effectively prevented losses. The mean surface runoff losses of total N were negligible (0.34.6 kg ha-1 yr-1) with the highest loss of 13 kg ha-1 yr-1 measured after slurry broadcasting to wet soil in autumn and followed with heavy rains. A substantial part (2455%) of the applied mineral N was not recovered by the foregoing measurements.;",

The history of migration and the consequences for potato production of potato wart, blackleg and soft rot, Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) and its vector powdery scab are reviewed as examples of economically important and biologically different potato pathogens. Potato wart spread alarmingly during 1920-1960. Plant quarantine acts and the use of resistant cultivars were successful in eradicating the disease. The pathogens causing blackleg and soft rot increased rapidly in 1960-1970. Development of seed certification schemes after the end of the 1970s decreased disease incidence and made the disease insignificant other than for seed potato production. Introduction of new strains of blackleg bacteria in 2003 caused the disease again to become a considerable threat to potato production. PMTV was imported into Finland in the 1970s where it spread rapidly, especially in starch potato production. Currently it is common in all potato production except that of seed potato. The disease cannot be eradicated but contamination of clean fields can be prevented. New diseases can spread to Finland in future but population changes of existing pathogens have recently caused more problems than species completely new to Finland.;",

The stochastic simulation model integrates nutrient dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sea basins adjoining the Finnish coast, nutrient loads from land and other sources, benefits from nutrient abatement (in the form of recreation and other ecosystem services) and the costs of agricultural abatement activities. The aim of the study is to present the overall structure of the model and to demonstrate its potential using preliminary parameters. The model is made flexible for further improvements in all of its ecological and economic components. The results of a sensitivity analysis suggest that investments in reducing the nutrient load from arable land in Finland would become profitable only if the neighboring countries in the northern Baltic committed themselves to similar reductions. Environmental investments for improving water quality yield the highest returns for the Bothnian Bay and the Gulf of Finland, with smaller returns for the Bothnian Sea. Somewhat surprisingly, in the Bothnian Bay the abatement activities become profitable from the national viewpoint, because the riverine loads from Finland represent a high proportion of the total nutrient loads. In the Gulf of Finland, this proportion is low, but the size of the coastal population benefiting from improved water quality is high.",

In a flow-through system, the granule phosphate-retention capacity was 6–7 mg g−1, being largely unaffected by pre-leaching. Phosphate release from P-saturated granules was pH-dependant and suggested P association with Fe oxides, and as Ca-phosphate precipitates. In a sequential extraction of P-saturated granules, about 25% of retained P was released, whereas a separate anaerobic incubation resulted in negligible release of P. Immersion of unleached, P-saturated granules for 16 days in a low-P–concentration lake resulted in more than 80% Ca loss, but no loss of metals, and about 25% loss of P accumulated earlier in granules. These granules are promising for P retention and merit a field-scale study.",

Weaned piglets received mixtures containing RPC and legume mixtures. Considerable differences were found in amino acid composition of proteins. Differences in the apparent digestibility of essential nutrients were statistically insignificant. Sows fed with field bean and yellow lupine gave birth to heaviest piglets.

Linear and threshold animal and sire models were used to estimate genetic parameters and genetic trends for stillbirth in the first, second, and third parities. Mean incidence of stillbirth decreased from first to third parities: 23.7%, 22.1%, and 21.8%, respectively. Phenotypic rates of stillbirth decreased from 1993 to 1998, for first, second and third calvings, and then increased from 1998 to 2007 for the first three parities. Direct heritability estimates of stillbirth for parities 1, 2 and 3 ranged from 2.2 to 8.7%, 0.6 to 5.1% and 0.1 to 3.8%, respectively, and maternal heritability estimates of stillbirth for parities 1, 2 and 3 ranged from 1.4 to 6.3%, 0.5 to 4.2% and 0.08 to 2.0%, respectively, using linear and threshold animal models. The threshold sire model estimates of heritabilities for stillbirth in this study were 0.021 to 0.071, while the linear sire model estimates of heritabilities for stillbirth in the current study were from 0.003 to 0.021 over the parities. There was a slightly increasing genetic trend for stillbirth rate in parities 1 and 2 over time with the analysis of linear animal and linear sire models. There was a significant decreasing genetic trend for stillbirth rate in parity 1 and 3 over time with the analysis of threshold animal and threshold sire models, but the genetic trend for stillbirth rate in parity 2 with these models of analysis was significantly positive. The low estimates of heritability obtained in this study implied that much of the improvement in stillbirth could be attained by improvement of production environment rather than genetic selection.;",

The mean of these pairwise Fst values revealed differences between herds depending, mainly, on the proportion of common sires shared between the herds. In addition, we investigated the cause of negative Fst values. Based on our results, these negative values could be interpreted as an excess of within-herd genetic diversity over the between-herds genetic diversity.

The sward was harvested after wilting at low dry matter (DM) (LDM, 194 g kg-1) and high DM (HDM, 314 g kg-1) concentrations and half of the herbage batches were inoculated with Clostridium tyrobutyricum spores before additive treatments. No butyric acid fermentation was observed in HDM silages probably because of the relatively high DM and nitrate contents of the herbage mixture. In LDM silage butyric acid was detected only in formic acid-treated silage, and the number of clostridia copies was higher in formic acid-treated than in sodium nitrite treated silage. Sodium nitrite treatment was superior to FA treatment in suppressing clostridial fermentation in the LDM silages.",

Their interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and phosphorus (P) supply were also addressed. All experimental factors influenced barley growth. Shoot height and biomass of barley were increased by FH and reduced by RH. AMF decreased barley biomass at high P-supply. In wheat, the biomass was slightly reduced by AMF while other factors had no significant effect. In the parallel field experiment, RH but not FH increased yield and grain size of barley, while there was no significant effect of either hydrolysate on wheat. Application time had no effect on hydrolysate efficacy. Both hydrolysates promoted severity of net blotch (Pyrenophora teres maculata) on barley in the pot experiment, but reduced it in field. FH promoted wheat root colonisation by AMF under low-P supply. Our results show limited transferability of pot results to field conditions and manifest complex interactions between hydrolysates, soil phosphorus, and plant symbionts and pathogens.",

An unbalanced data panel covering 3578 Swedish dairy farms in the period 2002-2012 was used. The analysis showed that in the study period, environmental farm support decreased the differences in farm revenue generated by agri-environmental output constraints in Sweden. However, the environmental support distribution did not succeed in meeting regional needs, so difficulties in farmers’ ability to generate output in southern and central forest and valley areas of Sweden were visible. Furthermore, the environmental agricultural support had only a partial subsidisation effect on ‘green’ farm management practices, with full compensation being achieved for organic and capital-extensive farming, whereas low livestock density farming was not sufficiently compensated. This analysis reveals incentives with policy implications for farm economic performance and provides direct input to future policy recommendations for environmental support allocation.",

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possible existence of buyer power in the Finnish food supply chain. More specifically, we follow an approach used by Lloyd et al. (2009) to measure oligopsony power among the Finnish food industry and retailers against farmers. The results suggest that the spread between producer and retailer prices in Finland is not consistent with perfectly competitive behaviour, and might thus be caused, at least as a candidate amongst other factors, by the existence of oligopsony power in the Finnish food supply chain.",

N2O emissions were more variable showing also highest emissions (20.3 µg N kg dw-1 h-1) from the oldest samples.

    "abstract": "The possibility of improving the soil phosphorus status by a store dressing with rock phosphate has been studied in two field trials of five years standing. Hyperphosphate Reno was applied to the nurse crop of a red clover-timothy ley in amounts of 0, 1000 kg/ha, or 2000 kg/ha, respectively. The split-plot technique was used to study the response of the ley to an additional annual application of 200 kg/ha of superphosphate. The soil analyses distinctly proved that, in spite of a careful working in of the hyperphosphate with a spade harrow, the fertilizer had not penetrated deeper than to the layer from 1 to 3 inches, with a large part of it remaining in the top inch. The treatment with hyperphosphate had mostly increased the fraction of the calcium-bound phosphorus, and, to a very low degree, the aluminium-bound phosphorus. The effect of superphosphate could be detected only in the fractions of aluminium- and iron-bound phosphorus of the surface inch. Although the store dressing did not produce marked responses in the yields of either trial, the statistically significant negative interaction between the effect of it and of superphosphate may be taken to indicate that hyperphosphate was able to improve the phosphorus status of these soils to some degree. The analyses of the hay samples from one of the trials in the fifth experimental year showed that the store dressing, particularly with the higher amount of hyperphosphate was able to increase the phosphorus content of hay to a satisfactory level which was equal to that produced by the annual superphosphate dressing only. Their combined effect resulted in the production of hay dry matter containing more than 0.24 % of P. In one of the experiments the residual effect of the treatments on rye was studied. The response to superphosphate was highly significant, probably owing to the high demands of phosphorus by rye, connected with the overwintering conditions, and also to the fact that ploughing in of the ley had brought superphosphate phosphorus within the reach of the plant roots.",

Furthermore, for carrots, insecticide and herbicide spray frequencies increased more than treatment volumes.

    "abstract": "Enteric methane (CH4) represents about half of the climatic footprint of milk production in Finland. Methane is generated from the surplus hydrogen produced during the anaerobic feed digestion process in the rumen. Methane intensity per liter of energy corrected milk (g CH4 kg-1 ECM) is a function of the number of cows, milk yield (MY), replacement rate (RR), and the diet composition. This study aimed to model and report the inventory of CH4 from milk production in Finland between 1960 and 2020. Furthermore, we report the potential future scenarios of CH4 mitigation strategies based on the further development in MY and feed efficiency with constant or changing BW of cows. The diet composition of cattle was formulated for 5-year periods according to feed consumption statistics (ProAgria 2021) and the current metabolizable energy (ME) requirements for dairy cattle (Luke 2021a). The CH4 production from cattle was simulated using the formulated diets with the Nordic dairy cow model Karoline. The future CH4 mitigation scenarios of increased MY and improved feed efficiency were simulated using Lypsikki® dairy farm model. During the inventory period, the number of cows (1000) decreased from 1150 to less than 258, and MY increased three-fold. The total milk and CH4 production peaked in 1965 being 3650 and 110 million kg per year and decreased to 2300 and 48 million kg per year in 2020, respectively. Consequently, decreased number of cows and increased MY reduced the total CH4 production by 56%. In addition, CH4 intensity improved by 36% during the inventory period. Of the future scenarios, increased MY and improved feed efficiency had a substantial potential to improve CH4 intensity. In both scenarios maintaining the current BW of cows resulted in higher mitigation potential. We conclude that selecting more efficient animals has a significant CH4 mitigation potential.",

FI variability is decomposed to three components: market income, total subsidies, and the cost of external factors. The results reveal that subsidies have a larger share in income of smaller farms. Variability of FI differs in farm size quartiles and is significantly lower in case of largest 25% of farms. Revenues are the largest source of variation of FI. While subsidies reduce FI variation, there is no evidence that they are counter-cyclical. We argue that in addition to subsidies, smaller farms need advice on farm management to increase market income, improve its stability, and expand farm size, as larger farms have more stable incomes despite relatively lower producer support estimate (PSE) levels.",

    "abstract": "Weather extremes in parts of Europe have led to a renewed search for alternative feeds for ruminants. Cereal straw presents one source of fibre, which is hard to digest due to its lignin-carbohydrate complexes. Chemical and biological treatments have been investigated to improve digestibility. Here, the applicability of alkaline treatments for farming conditions under EU legislation and their efficacy were checked. Thus, we tested caustic soda (60, 120 g kg-1straw) and urea (15, 30, 45, 60 g kg-1 straw without and with urease addition) applications both at laboratory scale and using a mixer-wagon. The nutritive value was evaluated analyzing chemical parameters including fibre components and estimating in vitro digestibility. The in vitro digestibility indicated by gas production, enzymatically soluble substrate and neutral detergent fibre digestibility (30h) was highest for the NaOH treatments, which did not differ by dose. Remoistening the straw to 600 g DM kg-1 was a precondition for the effectiveness of both treatments. Urease addition enhanced the intended ammonification when urea was applied at ≥ 30 g kg-1. An ambient temperature for urea treatment ≥ 25 °C was necessary and had to be maintained for at least 14 d post treatment. The determination of crude ash in NaOH treated feeds by the standard procedure and time overestimated the mineral fraction and had to be modified. This systematic approach provides guidance for feasible straw treatments for EU farmers. However, trials for feed acceptance and in vivo digestibility are needed to demonstrate the real effect in animals.",

The intake of other constituents discussed can be regarded as being nutritionally adequate, although the amounts of protein and particularly those of niacin have been in many cases rather scanty.

    "abstract": "The heritability and repeatability for trotting performance traits were estimated from individual race results. Data comprised of records from 1991 to 1995 for 4808 Finnhorses and from 1993 to 1995 for 5869 Standardbred trotters. The statistical model included the additive genetic effect of an animal and two permanent environmental effects, and the fixed effects of sex, age, starting method*starting lane combination, driver and race. The first permanent environmental effect described repeatability over a horses career while the second one characterized repeatability within a racing year. Variance components for three trotting performance traits were estimated by the animal model and the method of restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Heritability and repeatability estimates were moderately high for time at finish (h 2 =0.230.28 and r=0.500.57), moderate for ranking within a race (h 2 =0.12 and r=0.25) and low for earnings (h 2 =0.050.09 and r=0.150.18). Time at finish seemed to be the most usable measure of trotting performance because of its wide information substance. However, time at finish does not take into account records of disqualified horses or of those which did not finish, but use of earnings, either from individual race results or preferably from annual records, is one possible way to consider records of such horses.;",

The food labels of 689 packaged food products were checked for salt and sodium information on the basis of Finnish regulations on salt. Products with reduced salt contents were found in most food groups but not among whole-meat or ready-to-eat foods. Half of the products with reduced amounts of salt were labelled \"lightly salted\". All four supermarkets had a similar assortment of lightly salted products. From the public health point of view, the food industry should increase the supply of lightly salted products, and make a special effort to develop lightly salted ready-to-eat foods.",

The experimental factors included also irrigation and treatments where the nitrogen fertilizer was applied in the first year as 15N-labelled ammonium nitrate. During four years, 41-66% of the nitrogen applied in the first growing season was recovered in plants harvested. Most of it, 91-96%, was taken up in the year applied. Mostly, the water drainage was lowest in silt and sand soils. The irrigation increased clearly the leaching of nitrogen almost in all treatments. Crops decreased the drainage of water through the lysimeters and the leaching of nitrogen, grass more than barley. The effects of plants and irrigation were similar in all soils, but most marked in sand. The largest amount of nitrogen was leached in irrigated, fallowed sand, 440 kg ha-1, during four years. The majority of the leached nitrogen was nitrate. Only in peat soil a significant amount of nitrogen was leached in some another form. The leaching of 15N-labelled fertilizer during four years was highest in sand, 2.3 kg ha 1 of N or 2.3% of the nitrogen applied in the first experimental year.",

The studied 24 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), 13 rye (Secale cereale L.), 5 triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) and 11 barley (Hordeum vulgäre L.) cultivars differed highly significantly from each other in winter survival ability determined in field trials during 1989-1992 at six locations in Finland and at altogether 17 locations in all the Nordic countries. The Field Survival Indexes of cultivars were determined, too. Rye was the most winter hardy species followed by winter wheat, triticale and barley. Since field trials often fail to screen the resistance of plants to specific winter stress factors, such as frost or snow mould, laboratory tests were used to study these factors. On the basis of the results it could be concluded that, during cold acclimation, sugars and proline are accumulated, and the fatty acid composition of the plasma membrane lipid fractions is changed. Cold acclimation enhances frost resistance and general winterhardiness of overwintering cereals, but part of the snow mould (Microdochium nivale (Fries) Samuels &amp; Hallet) resistance may be induced without low temperature treatment. Thus, different resistance mechanisms may be controlling frost and snow mould resistance. The results of this study suggest that general winterhardiness of overwintering species could be enhanced by screening separately resistance mechanisms of plants to various specific winter stress factors and combining these into new cultivars.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal dairy calves were randomly allotted to three colostrum feeding regimens with increasing intakes of immunoglobulins (Ig) on the first day of life. The control group was fed one litre of pooled colostrum (Ig intake 19.5 g). In two experimental groups, the pooled colostrum was supplemented with 0.5 or 1.5 litres of commercial Ig-concentrate, giving a total Ig intake of 52.7 and 119.0 g, respectively. Serum IgG, IgM and IgA levels increased linearly (p &lt; 0.001) on day 2 post partum with the increasing Ig intake. The calculated mean Ig-absorption rate was 61% and decreased linearly for IgM (p = 0.051) and IgG (p = 0.078) with increasing Ig intake. At the highest Ig intake, serum IgG remained above 10 g/l during 30 days post partum. In the experimental groups, serum IgM and IgA decreased sharply during the first week of life and were relatively constant thereafter. In the control group, however, there was an increase in serum IgM after one week post partum, perhaps due to the in situ production of Ig. With the increasing Ig intake there was a small and non-significant tendency for better live weight gain (p = 0.286) and a lower incidence of diarrhoea (p = 0.421) during the first four weeks of life. It is concluded that the Ig-product tested is well absorbed during 24 hours post partum and it can be used either as a supplement to maternal colostrum when its quality is poor, or as a substitute when colostrum is not available.",

This paper describes the growth characteristics of two carrot cultivars in relation to climatic conditions in two years, with special reference to the factors associated with high yield. Cv. Fontana produced twice as large a leaf area and shoot weight as cv. Panther. Increased partitioning to shoot in the former cultivar also resulted in a higher root yield. Uniformity in relative growth rates during the period of analysis suggests that intervarietal differences in the shoot to root ratio and in the yield potential appear very early. Nearly half of the root weight at final harvest was gained after mid-August, when temperature and daily irradiance began to decrease. A large leaf area may ensure better utilisation of diminishing growth resources at the end of the growing season. In the more favourable growing season, 1997, plants invested more in leaf production than they did in 1996: shoot fresh and dry weights were considerably higher but leaf area was not much higher.;",

    "abstract": "Worldwide interest in soil quality evaluation has increased rapidly throughout the past decade, prompting us to evaluate the long-term impact of four cropping systems on several biological, chemical and physical determinants of soil quality. We hypothesized that after 17 years several of the determinants would show significant differences between conventional cereal and low input/organic rotations. Four crop rotations were imposed on a silt soil from 1982 through 1999. Rotation A was a conventionally managed cereal rotation that received 100% of the recommended mineral fertilizer each year. Rotation B was also managed conventionally from 1982 until 1993, although it received only 50% of the recommended mineral fertilizer. From 1994 through 1999, rotation B was managed as an organic rotation. Rotations C and D were low-input rotations with plant residues returned either untreated (C)or composted (D)from 1982 until 1994.From 1994 through 1999,they were also anaged organically. Significant decreases in extractable phosphorus (P)and potassium were observed in rotations C and D compared with rotation A, presumably because their yearly nutrient inputs were somewhat lower. The amount of soil organic carbon (Corg), soil water holding capacity, the numbers and biomass of earthworms and the microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen were or tended to be higher in low input/organic than in conventionally managed plots. These effects may be in connection with the slightly increased levels of Corg in soil of the organic rotations. Activities of twelve enzymes were strongly affected by sampling time (early-versus late-summer), but much less by long-term management. Litter decomposition, numbers of soil nematodes, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)fungal diversity,AM spore density and AM functioning were little affected by rotation. However,AM spore density correlated positively with the high amounts of extractable calcium and P which were a result from excessive liming applied to some plots in 1982. The crucial question to be answered in future is whether plant growth and yield will correlate with the changes in soil properties. This question will be dealt with in a further paper using data from the same experiment.;",

    "abstract": "The use of Finnsheep (F) as experimental animals on fertility has created interest in the origin of it and its prolificacy. Linguistic and archeological evidence indicate that wool has been used in Finland for 2 000 years and that sheep have been kept for over 1 000 years. The ancestors of F may have arrived either with Finns from the present Russia, where the short-tailed and prolific Romanov breed is found, or with Vikings or western settlers from Scandinavia, where there also are short-tailed breeds. Finnish terms concerning weaving (mainly Slavic loans) speak for the former, the sheep husbandry terms (mainly Germanic loans) for the latter source. In the 16th and 18th centuries, foreign breeds were imported to western Finland, but they were not accepted by farmers. When animals from northeastern Finland were mainly used as foundations for the herd book work, the present F may stem mainly from the original stock. The breed has long been kept in small flocks and thus been subject of inbreeding and weak selection. Since the establishment of herd book and production recording the live and fleece weights as well as litter sizes have increased. Wool was the main product until the 1920’s, but meat has been most important during the last 60 years, excepting war times. Presently one aims at effective utilization of its versatility, i.e. for meat, handicraft wool, luxury furs, and forest and landscape management.",

Polkka) under different temperature and CO2 growing conditions. The effects of elevated temperature (3-4°C) and CO2 concentration (700 ppm) as expected for Finland in 2100 were simulated. The model was calibrated for long-day growing conditions in Finland. The CERES-wheat genetic coefficients for cv. Polkka were calibrated by using the MTT Agrifood Research Finland (MTT) official variety trial data (1985-1990). Crop phenological development and yield measurements from open-top chamber experiments with ambient and elevated temperature and CO2 treatments were used to validate the model. Simulated mean grain yield under ambient temperature and CO2 conditions was 6.16 t ha-1 for potential growth (4.49 t ha-1 non-potential) and 5.47 t ha-1 for the observed average yield (1992-1994) in ambient open-top chamber conditions. The simulated potential grain yield increased under elevated CO2 (700 ppm) to 142% (167% non-potential) from the simulated reference yield (100%, ambient temperature and CO2 350 ppm). Simulations for current sowing date and elevated temperature (3°C) indicate accelerated anthesis and full maturity. According to the model estimations, potential yield decreased on average to 80.4% (76.8% non-potential) due to temperature increase from the simulated reference. When modelling the concurrent elevated temperature and CO2 interaction, the increase in grain yield due to elevated CO2 was reduced by the elevated temperature. The combined CO2 and temperature effect increased the grain yield to 106% for potential growth (122% non-potential) compared to the reference. Simulating the effects of earlier sowing, the potential grain yield increased under elevated temperature and CO2 conditions to 178% (15 days earlier sowing from 15 May, 700 ppm CO2, 3°C) from the reference. Simulation results suggest that earlier sowing will substantially increase grain yields under elevated CO2 growing conditions with genotypes currently cultivated in Finland, and will mitigate the decrease due to elevated temperature. A longer growing period due to climate change will potentially enable cultivation of new cultivars adapted to a longer growing period. Finally, adaptation strategies for the crop production under elevated temperature and CO2 growing conditions are presented.;",

Defoliation height affects the magnitude of all these factors. Timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) are the two most common pasture species in Finland, but little is known about their response to defoliation height. In this study the effect of three defoliation heights, 3, 6 and 9 cm, on the regrowth rates of timothy and meadow fescue in both the generative (JuneJuly) and vegetative (August) phases of growth were examined in two one-year experiment in year 2000 and 2001. In addition, the main postdefoliation parameters were measured and their contributions to regrowth were studied. In JuneJuly 2000 the regrowth rates, kg dry matter ha-1 d-1, of both species increased linearly by 19% by increasing the cutting height from 3 to 9 cm. In August 2000 the regrowth rates increased by 27% and the cumulative regrowth dry matter yield increased by 29%. In 2001 the defoliation height had no effect on the regrowth rates but the cumulative regrowth yield increased by 10% by increasing the cutting height. Meadow fescue produced 821% higher cumulative regrowth yields than timothy. In the reproductive phase, the regrowth rate of timothy is dependent on the population density of vegetative tillers but for meadow fescue population density did not have such importance. In vegetative phase there was no single factor essential for regrowth rates of either of the species.;",

    "abstract": "Cover crops can reduce leaching and erosion, introduce variability into crop rotations and fix nitrogen (N) for use by the main crops. In Finland, undersowing is a suitable method for establishing cover crops in cereals. The effect of annual undersowing on soil nitrate N was studied at two sites. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), a mixture of red clover and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), and westerwold ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. var. westerwoldicum) were undersown in spring cereals during six successive seasons, and a pure stand of cereal was grown in two years after that. In all years, the soil nitrate N was measured in late autumn, and in addition in different times of the season in last four years. The effect of undersowing on soil NO3-N content was generally low, but in one season when conditions favoured high N leaching, westerwold ryegrass decreased soil NO3-N. The negligible increase of N leaching risk in connection with undersowing clovers, associated with late autumn ploughing, supports the use of clovers to increase the cereal grain yield. The highest levels of soil NO3-N were recorded at sowing in spring irrespective of whether a crop was undersown or not. NO3-N contents were higher in sandy soil than in silt. Undersowing can be done annually in cereal cultivation either to fix or catch N. No cumulative effects on soil nitrate N were associated with undersowing after six years.;",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this report was to study all available information for estimating the sources of naturally occurring sodium and added salt in the Finnish diet. The calculations were based on food consumption statistics, sales figures of salt, salt use in the Finnish food industry and catering, and on the food consumption data provided by the mobile clinic dietary survey of 1973—1976. The average daily per capita intake of added salt is 10—11 g and that of the naturally occurring sodium in foodstuffs is 0.6 g which is equivalent to 1.5g of NaCl, the total intake being 11—12 g. In the adult population the mean daily intake of sodium expressed as NaCl is 12—15 g in men and 10—12 g in women. The average salt concentration in the diet is 4.3 g/1 000 kcal (10.3 g/10 MJ) and that of adults 4.5 g/1 000 kcal (10.6 g/10 MJ). Of the total sodium intake 50 % is derived from the salt used by the food industry and in catering, 38 % from salt added by the consumer at home, and 12 % from the naturally occurring sodium in the foodstuffs. Of the added salt, 57 %is used by the food industry and catering and 43 % by the consumer. Of the different food items, baked products (bread, buns and pastries) arc the most important sources of sodium, constituting 22 % of the total sodium intake. The share of bread alone is 16% and that of sausages and other meat products is 14%. The share of other food items is less than 10 %.",

    "abstract": "The effect of the first cutting date and cutting frequency on the clover-grass stand growth and development and on the relationships between plant species were studied at the University of Helsinki in 1974—76. The second study objective was the relationships between several growth factors and the yield components of the stand. The third study area comprised the energy value changes and the photosynthetic activity of the stand during different phases of the growing season. The most rapid growth and development occurred within the temperature range of 400—500° C (∑ &gt; 0° C). The late first cutting date increased yields most in the 2 and 3-cutting systems and least in the 4-cutting system, due to two summer cuts during the dry period of the season. Due to the regrowth ability of the species and lack of water in midsummer leading easily to dormancy there was a negative correlation between the first and the second cut and a positive correlation between the following successive cuts. The most important variables in the regression model describing DM production in the first, second, third and fourth cut were temperature sum in degree days, precipitation during the week before the previous cut, amount of precipitation between cuts and the physiological activity of the stand, respectively. The energy value of spring and autumn DM yield was higher than that of midsummer. The average photosynthetic efficiency was 0.95 % in 1974 and 0.47 % in 1975. The DM content of the yield in spring decreased until the temperature sum of 420° C (∑ &gt; 0° C) and then increased linearly. The DM content, protein content, digestibility of DM and protein yield in the total yields were mostly influenced by the first cut if made when the slope showed either decreasing or increasing values of DM content. Otherwise a late first cutting date or low cutting frequency lowered the quality of the forage. In the mixture the spring growth of timothy ceased by the end of June and was replaced by red-clover. The regrowth of timothy ceased by the middle of July and was replaced by meadow fescue. The growth of red clover was the most uniform throughout the entire growing season.",

In this study, results from the biogeochemical, soil geochemical and Quaternary mapping programmes at SGU were used to investigate the impact of fine-grained deposits hosting AS soils on stream water trace element chemistry in two separate areas. In the area around Lake Mälaren, postglacial sediments contain the highest levels of most trace elements studied. Owing to the low pH of AS soils and subsequent leaching, levels of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), sulphur (S), yttrium (Y), uranium (U), tungsten (W), and molybdenum (Mo) were significantly elevated in aquatic roots. Levels were lower in the Skellefteå area, which may be explained by lower concentrations in source deposits. Concentrations of arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) were normal or impoverished in biogeochemical samples from postglacial, finegrained sediment areas. Maps based on ratios (Ni:Pb or Y:Pb) in biogeochemical samples can, together with results from Quaternary mapping, be used to predict areas with AS soils in Sweden.;",

The proportion of damage caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schl. was 0—5 % and was present in 0—10 % of the spoilt onions. The early weight losses during storage of the onions were mostly due to storage pathogens which spread via the onion sets used as propagation material. This can be prevented very effectively by soaking the sets in benomyl solution before planting out. The unusually high fungus content of the sets resulted in a reduced yield. Spraying with fungicide early on in the growing season and applying different amounts of nitrogen fertilizer had no significant effect on the number of storage pathogens. A low stroge temperature did not inhibit the development of storage pathogens, it merely slowed it down.",

The intra-panicle variation in development is likely to influence potential grain size. This may result from differences in activity and duration of the cell division phase, vascular transport capacity, duration of filling period and/or hormonal balance. In this preliminary survey we studied intra-panicle variation in pollination (when clusters of pollen were visibly attached to stigmatic branches) of florets and cell division in developing grains immediately after pollination of the oat cultivars Belinda and Fiia. We found substantial intra-panicle variation for both traits. The highest cell number was found in the uppermost, most advanced, primary grain, while secondary grains tended to have fewer cells compared with their counterpart primary grains irrespective of their position. Results of an additional experiment indicated that death of the primary floret in the conventional oat cultivar Virma prior to pollination, resulted in higher weight of secondary grain, though this never equalled that of the primary counterpart. This limited growth capacity may partly result from lower cell number. These results encourage us to continue with experiments on the contribution of groat cell number to sink strength and grain-filling capacity.;",

The study determined the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) coefficients of amino acids in barley, wheat, oats, triticale, maize, and dehulled oats in the diets of 180 Ross broiler chickens (aged 2435 days). The birds were fed semi-purified diets that contained grain as the sole protein source and chromium-mordanted straw as an indigestible marker. The AID coefficients of the nutrients were assessed using the slaughter technique, and the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) was determined using total excreta collection. The ileal digestibility of the dry matter and organic matter were the highest in maize. The AME of maize was higher than that of other cereals. The ileal digestibility of crude protein was higher in wheat than that in barley, oats and dehulled oats. The AME of wheat was similar to that of barley and oats but lower than that of triticale and dehulled oats. The amino acid AID was highest in wheat (0.86) and triticale (0.85) and lowest in oats (0.79) and barley 0.77). The average amino acid AID was 0.81 in dehulled oats. The threonine AID was the same in all tested ingredients.

This was done using three sowing times and four rye varieties in field trials conducted at three locations in 19992001. The early sown rye was severely affected by pests (Oscinella frit, Mayetiola destructor) and weeds, whereas postponing sowing for two weeks after the recommended sowing time in late August resulted in considerably less damage and the optimal establishment of crop stands. The German hybrid varieties Picasso and Esprit produced more tillers m-2 in autumn than the Finnish varieties Anna and Bor 7068. However, the number of pests and weeds did not differ among rye varieties. Late sowing of rye should be considered to minimize the need for plant protection. If rye is sown at the recommended time it may still require insecticide treatments promptly in the autumn whereas herbicide treatment need not be determined until spring, after recording the winter mortality of weeds.;",

Pig slurry, NPK fertilizer and plain peat were used as references. Manures were incorporated before sowing or surface-applied after sowing in spring at an ammoniacal N rate of.54.106 kg.ha-1 with or without supplementary NPK fertilizer (40.kg N.ha-1). Soil moisture conditions were varied by different irrigation treatments. Peat manure produced 5.15% higher grain yields than pig slurry, with the largest difference after surface application. Incorporation was more important for slurry than for peat manure in increasing N uptake and yield. Soil moisture deficit in spring and early summer limited the availability of manure N. Part of the manure N that was not available in the early growing period was apparently taken up by the crop later. Consequently, N concentration tended to be higher with lower yields, and differences in the recovery of manure N were smaller than the differences in grain yield. Supplementation of manures with inorganic fertilizer N increased yield by 37%, on average, and improved the N recovery.;",

The Cd content of Finnish linseed is of interest, since some properties of linseed as the content of fatty acids are different in northern growth locations compared with other growing areas. Seed samples (N = 85) were collected from the experimental farm of Helsinki University and from commercial fields in different locations in southern Finland and Ostrobothnia. In addition, 15 samples of linseed crush were examined. The cadmium contents of the linseed samples, determined with atomic absorption spectroscopy, varied between 0.27 and 1.3 mg kg-1 (dry weight) (mean 0.61 mg kg-1). The Cd contents of the crush samples were between 0.47 and 1.5 mg kg-1 (mean 0.85 mg kg-1). There were differences between the Cd contents of the three examined varieties and years at the experimental farm. Increase in nitrogen fertilization somewhat increased the Cd uptake of linseed. The permitted intake of linseed depends on body weight and on the Cd content of the product and is in most cases higher than the dietary recommendation (2430 g daily dose of linseed).;",

It is therefore important to analyse how the reduction in N fertilization affects N leaching at the root zone scale. In this study the nutrient leaching model ICECREAM was used to demonstrate the effects of climatic conditions and decreased N input on N leaching. Ten years (19912000) of climatic input data from five stations located in different parts of the country were used as input to simulate nitrate N (NO3-N) leaching from barley cultivation with i) constant N fertilization (Baseline simulation, 90 kg N ha1) and ii) decreasing N fertilization (N Reduction Scenario simulation: annual linear decrease from 110 to 90 kg N ha1). The annual and regional variation of simulated N leaching was considerable in both the Baseline and N Reduction Scenario simulations. In the Baseline simulation the average annual NO3-N leaching was 24% of the N fertilization amount. From 1991 to 2000, the annual N leaching decreased close to Baseline leaching values in the N Reduction Scenario simulations, but the decrease was not linear due to high variability in N losses caused by changes in annual weather conditions. The model results indicate that it is possible to achieve a reduction in root zone N leaching by adjusting the fertilizer levels.;",

An algorithm and a mathematical model were composed to calculate the total costs depending on the distance to the plot. The transportation costs of machines and materials, cost of organisational travel and timeliness costs are taken into account in the model to enable determination of the maximum distance or the minimum area of the plot necessary for profitable cultivation. Simulations allow us to conclude that the growth in yield and selling price of the production allow an increase in the limit value of driving costs and, thus, the profitable distance of the plot; on the other hand, it means also an increase of timeliness costs as a limitation for extending distance.

Significant effects of P fertilisation were observed at all sites that had low or medium PAc values; in the case of potatoes, even at sites with fairly high values. The mean relative yield without applied P divided by yield with 60 or 45 kg P ha-1 of the ten sites was 81% (mean PAc 11.6 mg dm-3) varying from 55% at the PAc value of 4.7 mg dm-3 to 100% at the highest PAc values.

Winter rye and winter wheat were used as reference crops. The efficiency of applying all N at the tillering stage (N100%+N0) was the highest for the grain yield of triticale. N application at development stage of plants BBCH47 increased the grain protein concentration significantly and the increase by 1 kg N was the highest in triticale cultivars. More stabile grain yield was produced by triticales in application regime N+N. N splitting did not influence significantly either the duration of the grain-filling period or the dry matter accumulation rate of triticale. N splitting affected Hagberg falling number (HFN) indirectly through the effect on the grain yield formation and grain protein concentration. HFN was positively correlated with the grain yield and negatively with the grain protein concentration. The suitable N regimes are: 1) triticale as the energy plant  N60+N0  N applied at the tillering stage of plants and suitable N norm is not more than 60 kg N ha-1; 2) triticale as a feed or food  N60+N60  High grain yield, protein and lysine concentration level are assured then.;",

Fiia) grown on Finnish acid sulphate (AS) soils with varying geochemical characteristics. Twenty two soil profiles, which were sampled to a depth of 1 m (five 20 cm section splits), and 26 composite oat grain samples were collected on a total of five fields. The concentrations of Co, Ni, Zn and Mn in the grains were correlated with the NH4Ac-EDTA-extractable concentrations in the soils. However, as these four chalcophilic metals are in general easily lost to drains and not retained as a large pool in the soil in easily-extractable form, also the concentrations in the oats were not in general elevated as compared with average values on other soils. On one of the fields, however, the Co and Ni concentrations in the soil, and thus also in the oats, were clearly elevated. Copper and Fe displayed no correlation between the soil and oat concentrations, indicating that the plant-uptake mechanisms are much more important than variations in geochemistry. It was suggested that the NH4Ac-EDTA solution was not efficient in extracting Fe and Cu, which shows that these metals are bound in relatively immobile oxyhydroxides.;",

Ultimate pH (pHu), meat colour (lightness, redness and yellowness), drip loss and two visually scored colour traits were recorded from 483 Finnish Landrace and 494 Finnish Large White station test pigs in a half-sib design. A univariate restricted maximum likelihood procedure was used to estimate variance components. The statistical model contained age at beginning of test, sex and time lapse from slaughter to dissection as fixed effects and slaughter batch, common environment of littermates and additive genetic effect of the animal as random effects. The average pHu values in adductor and semispinalis were between 5.6 and 6.1. The pHu were on average 5.4 and 5.5 in longissimus and semimembranosus respectively, with the latter two being lower than optimum values of 5.6 to 5.9. Lightness for semimembranosus turned to be clearly lighter (62) than for other muscles. Lightness for longissimus (56) was slightly lighter than optimum (from 48 to 54). The heritability varied from zero to 0.45 for pHu, from 0.02 to 0.34 for lightness, from 0.17 to 0.56 for redness, from zero to 0.28 for yellowness and from 0.05 to 0.16 for drip loss. Heritability for redness values was considerably higher than heritability for other meat quality traits. The heritability of quality traits spoke for possibilities for genetic improvement of meat quality. Genetic correlations between quality traits (pHu and lightness) and average daily gain varied strongly among breeds and muscles. Genetic correlations between meat-% and pHu were in most cases high and unfavourable (rg from 0.36 to 0.68 except in longissimus, where it was 0.11). Genetic correlations between meat-% and lightness were unfavourable in Finnish Large White (from 0.47 to 0.92) but in Finnish Landrace estimates varied among muscles (from 0.40 to 0.47). Due to these results, the ham quality (pHu and lightness for semimembranosus) was included in the selection criteria for pork quality in the Finnish pig improvement programme.;",

The compost types were municipal biowaste (Biowaste), biowaste + sewage sludge (BioSludge) and cattle manure (Manure). Plant yields and nitrogen (N) uptakes were measured for three years and efficiency of N utilization was estimated. In single application of compost, the total N was mainly in organic form and less than 10% was in inorganic form. Along with increasing amount of inorganic N applied in compost, the yield, N uptake and N recovery increased during the application year. The highest compost N recovery in the application year was 12%, found with Biowaste. In the following years the highest N recovery was found where the lowest total N had been applied. Clover performance was improved in the organic grass-clover ley established with BioSludge fertilization, producing total ley yield comparable with Manure compost. High total N application in composts caused high N surplus and low N use efficiency over three years. Generally, moderate compost fertilization is suitable for ley crops when supplemented with mineral N fertilizer or clover N fixation.;",

    "abstract": "The ideotype of a crop is a model of a plant community where all necessary and beneficial traits for crop performance in a particular environment are combined. It is important to consider the environment when developing an ideotype since climatic, edaphic and agronomic features of the target region have a major role in determining crop performance. New technologies, high yielding cultivars, irrigation and water management, plant protection materials and more skilful farm management practices have increased yields and yield potentials on cereals in Finland as in many other countries. In this paper we aim to summarize traits which would be useful from the farmers perspective. The most important trait is increased early vigour of spring cereals, including faster rate of early development and increased leaf area to improve both the resource capture of the canopy and water use efficiency. Introduction of dwarfing genes would improve lodging resistance and harvest index due to improved partitioning of dry matter into grains whereas longer coleoptiles would improve emergence and seedling establishment. Improved ability of crops to utilize stem reserves during grain filling would increase resistance against environmental stresses. All of these traits would also increase the competitive ability of the plant against weeds as well as competition within the crop canopy and are already available from non-adapted germplasm of the various spring cereal species.;",

    "abstract": "The genetic and epigenetic stability of hop accessions cryopreserved for one year or cold stored for three years was evaluated using several molecular markers (RAPD, AFLP, and MSAP). Clear, repetitive patterns were obtained among accessions and between control and treated samples. Although no genetic changes were detected among the control plants grown in the greenhouse and in vitro plants regenerated from slow-cooling cryopreserved shoot tips or cold stored in vitro shoots, MSAP analysis detected methylation changes in 36% of the loci. Nevertheless, only 2.6 to 9.8% of the detected changes could be ascribed to the conservation procedure and most of them seemed to be generated as a result of the in vitro introduction. Due to the number of accessions analysed (51) we can cautiously deduce that the genetic behaviour described in this work after cryopreservation or cold-storage protocols is common to most hop genotypes and these storage procedures are suitable for standard use. However, it is important to keep in mind the epigenetic changes produced, particularly during any in vitro processes.;",

Recorded survival was compared with number of intersections between the curves of simulated LT50 and the soil temperature curve for each field. A cumulative stress level (CSL) was calculated based both on number of intersections and FROSTOL simulated stress levels. The correlation between CSL and field recordings was quite low. While the field trials characterize a general ability to stand various types of winter stress, FROSTOL estimates damage caused by the soil temperature regime only.

The treatments were 0, 60 and 120 kg N ha-1 and the potato cultivars tested were Van Gogh and Nicola. Four successive harvests were made during the course of the experiment to monitor changes in the accumulation of dry matter and nitrogen over the season. Applications of nitrogen substantially increased haulm dry matter accumulation and to an even greater extent their nitrogen contents. The highest dry matter values were generally registered at 120 kg N ha-1. Dry matter and nitrogen content of haulms started to decline during the later part of season and most nitrogen was relocated to tubers. The results suggest that an application of only 60 kg N ha-1 was sufficient to promote rapid canopy development and there were only small reductions in dry matter and nitrogen accumulation until late in the season when the canopy started to senesce as nitrogen supply diminished. Tuber yield, plant dry matter and nitrogen accumulation at maturity were related to crop nitrogen supply. Although application of the high rate, 120 N kg ha-1, resulted in a significant increase in dry matter accumulation, this was not reflected in the profit because the higher nitrogen application reduced dry matter content of tubers by 2.6% in 2000 and by 1.1% in 2001 relative to the use of 60 kg N ha-1. Apparent fertilizer nitrogen recovery values on a whole plant basis ranged from 53 to 75%. The proportion of fertilizer recovered in tubers clearly declined with increase in nitrogen supply.;",

The natural handicap and small farm size are challenges, but farmers are further challenged by the decoupling of supports and their transformation into direct income payments. Additionally, farmers actions are limited by some institutional settings that substantially reduce incentives to improve productivity. Technical progress was found to drive the increase in productivity on grain farms in Finland. The scale had only a moderate effect and for the whole study period (19762006) the effect was close to zero. Total factor productivity (TFP) increased, depending on the model, by 0.61.7% per year. The results demonstrated that the increase in productivity was hindered by the policy changes introduced in 1995. The cumulative increase in TFP over the study period was at the same level as the measured yearly changes in TFP. The results highlight the nature of grain farming in Finland as well as the challenges in simultaneously taking into account the general trend and yearly variation in TFP.;",

Path modeling results from this study suggest that especially grains/ear, harvest index (HI) and maximum 1000 kernel weight were significant factors defining the highest yield potential. Mixed and Cultivation value modeling results suggest that when compared with genotypes introduced for cultivation before 1990s, modern spring wheat genotypes have a significantly higher yielding capacity, current high yielding mid-European genotypes even exceeding the 5 t ha-1 non-potential baseline yield level (yb). Because of a forthcoming climate change, the new high yielding wheat genotypes have to adapt for elevated temperatures and atmospheric CO2 growing conditions in northern latitudes. The optimized ideotype profiles derived from the generic high-latitude and mid-European genotypes are presented in the results. High-latitude and mid-European ideotype profiles with factors estimating the effects of concurrent elevated CO2 and temperature levels with photoperiodical daylength effects can be utilized when designing future high yielding ideotypes adapted to future growing conditions. The CERES-Wheat ideotype modeling results imply, that with new high yielding mid-European ideotypes, the non-potential baseline yield (yb) would be on average 5150 kg ha-1 level (+ 108 %) vs. new high-latitude ideotypes (yb 4770 kg ha-1, 100%) grown under the elevated CO2(700ppm)×temperature(+3ºC) growing conditions projected by the year 2100 climate change scenario in southern Finland.",

The reason for this is believed to be associated with the geological origin of the soil material and with the relative resistance to weathering of the minerals from which the trace elements are derived. In mineral soils the contents of trace elements increased with increasing organic matter and the maximum contents are likely to be found in soils containing from 5 to 15 per cent organic matter. A further increase in organic matter tends to decrease the total contents of trace elements expressed on a volume basis (kg/ha). The causes underlying this relation, which are believed to be pedological rather than chemical, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The ammonium fixing capacity of Finnish soils was studied by analysing a material of 139 samples from surface soils and 127 samples of deeper layers collected mainly from cultivated soils from various parts of the country. The pH-values of these samples measured in 0.02 N CaCl2-suspension ranged from 3.3 to 7.5, the content of organic C from 0 to 10.1 per cent, and the content of clay (&lt; 2 μ) from 0 to 96 per cent. The ammonium fixing capacity was determined under moist conditions by treating the samples for 24 hours with N NH4CI solution corresponding to 1000 m.e. of NH4-N per 100 g of soil, and removing the easily exchangeable ions by washing with CaCl2 -solutions. The difference in the nitrogen content of treated and untreated samples determined by digesting in concentrated sulfuric acid, was taken to indicate the amount fixed under these conditions. The results varied from 0 to 4.0 m.e./100 g of soil in the surface samples, and from 0 to 15.9 m.e./100 g of the soils from the deeper layers. The corresponding mean values were 1.0 and 3.8 m.e. per 100 g of soil, respectively. The association of the ammonium fixing capacity (1) with the clay content (2), pH (3), and the content of organic C (4) of the samples could be characterized by the following partial linear correlation coefficients; r12;34 = 0.472*** r13;24 = 0.177 r14;23 = –0.313** The total linear correlation coefficient between the ammonium fixing capacity and the fixation of potassium under moist conditions (2.5 m.e. of K added to 100 g of soil) was r = 0.829***. No correlation existed between the ammonium fixing capacity and the content of exchangeable potassium in these samples. Some of the results point to the possibility that in certain soils the coarser fractions, from 2 to 6 μ, or even from 6 to 20 μ, may play an important role in the fixing of ammonium in difficultly exchangeable form. In spite of the fact that under laboratory conditions the ammonium fixing capacity of Finnish soils may be fairly high, even in the surface soils, the conclusion was drawn that usually under the field conditions, the fixation of ammonium ions in difficultly exchangeable form might not reduce the effect of ammonium nitrogen fertilizers to any marked degree.",

Effects of intercropping of organically managed maize and faba beans to silage on acquisition of mineral nutrients in shoots of both crops and on leaf spot progression in faba beans were investigated. Three field experiments were performed with maize and faba bean intercropped or grown separately. Intercropping increased shoot concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Na, S and B in faba bean, and shoot concentrations of Cu, Zn and Mo in maize. Thus, the ecological complementary effects enhance feed quality. Disease severity index (DSI) of leaf spots in faba beans was reduced by intercropping by 42–57%, partly due to an increased Cu acquisition at sites where the Cu availability was low. There was a significant negative linear relationship between Cu concentration in shoots and DSI of leaf spots. Total uptake of mineral nutrients per land area was greater in the intercropping system with a total LER &gt; 1 for all mineral nutrients, except for P, Ca and Mn at one of the sites. Increased nutrient use efficiency, due to facilitative uptake from the soil, and the production of crops with higher contents of minerals compared with monocropping, are benefits of intercropped maize and faba beans.",

The objective of study was to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on carbon allocation and partitioning in different parts of plant, soil, and microbial biomass. An experiment was conducted on summer rape (Brassica napus L.) under increased levels of air temperature and atmospheric CO2 in controlled environment chambers. Results showed that the amount of leaf, stem and root carbon statistically significantly increased under elevated CO2 and temperature conditions. Microbial biomass carbon significantly increased by 11.2% and 13.5% under elevated CO2 and elevated CO2 and temperature, respectively, although soil carbon under both treatments decreased. It is concluded that carbon allocation is controlled under different climate conditions; however, elevated CO2 and temperature together will have a more significant effect for carbon allocation to different plant parts and microbial biomass carbon compared to elevated CO2 alone.",

According to feed analyses, the GS had 15 and 8% higher metabolizable energy (ME) concentration as well as 51 and 49% higher crude protein (CP) concentration compared to TS and BS, respectively. Average DM intake (DMI) on TS and BS containing diets was higher compared to GS as a sole forage (p=0.001). Compared to the TS based rations the use of BS rations increased daily DMI by 5% (p&lt;0.05). In CH bulls, DMI decreased 0.8 kg d-1when GS partially replaced TS or BS while in HF bulls the use of silage mixtures slightly increased DMI (0.23 kg d-1). The live weight gain (LWG) and carcass gain of the CH bulls were 5 and 26% higher, respectively, compared to the HF bulls. Inclusion of GS in the diet increased LWG and carcass gain with TS but decreased them with BS (interaction p&lt;0.01). The experiment demonstrated lower feeding value of TS compared to BS in the diet of the bulls. Whole crop silage based rations increased DMI compared to GS as a sole forage in the TMR. When GS partially replaced TS or BS, interactions in LWG and carcass gain results demonstrated higher feeding value for BS and lower for TS compared to GS. Feeding treatments had only minor effects on carcass traits of the bulls.",

Three litter bags were buried in soil basins, which were stored in the dark for 31 and 19 weeks in the sandy till experiment and medium fine sand experiment, respectively. Once per each temperature period, the soil was saturated in order to collect excess water for nutrient analyses. Biochar increased the decomposition rate of N-rich litter but did not affect the decomposition of N-poor litter. PO43--P and NO2--N were released from the biochar to the leached water and thus leaching of PO43--P, NO2--N and total P was increased in the soil with the finer texture. However, biochar retained water after heavy irrigation and leaching of PO43--P and total P was not increased on the coarser soil. Although pure biochar adsorbed NH4+-N from nutrient solutions, NH4+-N leaching from both soil types was generally not affected by biochar. Leaching of nitrate NO3--N and total N was decreased on both soils due to retention by the biochar.",

In breast and thigh meats, carbonyl content was noted to increase, whereas sulphydryl content decreased during frozen storage (p&lt;0.05). A significant decrease in protein solubility and water holding capacity (p&lt;0.05) was also determined due to denaturation and aggregation of proteins as a result of protein oxidation. Myofibrillar proteins, particularly myosin heavy chain, were identified to be more susceptible to oxidation although no notable changes were determined in sarcoplasmic protein pattern. In general, significant proteolytic changes were particularly noted from the third month of storage onward. This could be a useful finding in order to make a decision for shelf life and thus minimize undesirable quality changes in chicken meats. Additionally, strong correlations were noted between the examined quality parameters.",

In experiment 1, the standardised ileal digestibility (SID) of protein and amino acids (AA) of cakes was determined in 12 male cannulated pigs. Each diet was fed to six pigs during three seven-day periods. Ileal digesta was collected during the last three days of the period. In experiment 2, five groups each containing six female pigs with initial body weights (BW) of 20 kg were fed on diets containing BRC, YRC, or soyabean oil meal (SBM) as the main protein source. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and growth performance were measured untill 60 kg BW was reached, and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations in the colon, as well as the weight of the liver, kidney, heart, and thyroid, were recorded. The main differences between BRC and YRC were found in higher content of fat and protein, lower amounts of fibre and glucosinolates (Gls), and higher ATTD of fibre in YRC. Protein and AA SID, ATTD of nutrients, total SCFA colonic concentration, and growth performance did not significantly differ. The chemical composition of the three YRC was not uniform, the greatest differences were found among the amounts of Gls. The relative weights of the thyroid and heart were greater in pigs fed BRC than in YRC and SBM diets. Thyroid weight was positively correlated with dietary progoitrin, alkenyl Gls, and total Gls, whereas heart weight was positively correlated with progoitrin and alkenyl Gls. It was concluded that winter yellow-seeded rapeseed is a better raw material for cold-pressing than brown-seeded due to having lower Gls and fibre content.",

The aim of this study was to compare different tillage methods in the control of Elymus repens by using two intensified bare fallow strategies. Two field experiments consisted of three ploughing methods and seven fallow methods. The experiments were carried out in organic soils in Central Finland. The methods applied in the brief fallow before cereal sowing (exp. 1) were not effective enough against E. repens. Due to wet weather conditions in the spring the fallow period was limited to two weeks in both years, which did not seem to be enough time. In the late summer fallow after ley (exp. 2), the Kvick-Finn weed-cultivator destroyed E. repens very effectively; on average 5% of E. repens remained alive in the barley crop in the autumn of the following year. After use of ordinary cultivators 10% of E. repens remained alive, after use of the spade harrow 25% and after frequent mowing over 50% remained alive, respectively. As a result of effective E. repens control, barley yield was about 1000 kg ha-1 higher than without any fallow. In conclusion, effective control of E. repens is achieved with proper machinery and repeated treatments at the optimal time.",

The samples ground to pass through a 60 mesh (0.25 mm.) screen gave 0—5 % smaller results than those ground through an 1 mm. screen. Locating the extraction with ethanol-benzene before or after the prehydrolysis had no significant influence on the lignin values. The refluxing with water before the acid prehydrolysis lowered the lignin values (N-free) to some extent. The pepsin pretreatment lowered them still further. The nitrogen content of the part of crude lignin which was digested by pepsin was 9—13 %. On the nitrogen content of crude lignin obtained from faeces the use of pepsin had no influence. The hydrolysis procedure with 72 per cent sulphuric acid did not appear to be conventional as to the extension of the hydrolysis above the time needed, the effeciency of the stirring of the mixture or the stability of the temperature. The refluxing of the dilution after 72 per cent acid treatment was not necessary if the acid prehydrolysis was sufficiently effective. The lignin values obtained by different acid methods correspond to each other provided that certain fundamental principles are followed.",

The damage suffered by the Sirius tetrapl. Svalöv variety included in the tests only for two years, was considerably slighter than in other varieties. In the second test in which the varieties listed on page 272 were included for four successive years, the Zwaans Brabo was damaged least of all, the damage being below the average in every year investigated. As to the Purple Top Mammoth the damage was continually above the average. In this group, too, the number of the damaged specimens of the »Native» big-leafed turnip was above the average. The shape of the turnips (the material was grouped as follows: 1. the flat and flat-round, 2. the round, and 3. the long-round and fairly long turnips) did not seem to affect the extent of the damage caused by the cabbage maggots, not at any rate when the level of damage was slight or moderate as in the cases investigated. It is, however, obvious, that in cases of severe damage the round and long-round varieties which generally have strong roots, endure damage better and recover from it more quickly than the flat and flat-round varieties with their thin roots.",

    "abstract": "The availability to plants of native peat phosphorus was studied by chemical methods and by a pot experiment in which three successive oat crops were grown with peat as the only source of phosphorus. The eight samples were collected from virgin peat lands. They were air-dried and ground. The samples were found to represent three different types of phosphorus condition: the first group contained relatively high amounts of inorganic phosphorus which was fairly easily available; the second group had a very high capacity to fix phosphorus which made its high quantity of inorganic phosphorus difficultly available; the third group was very poor in total and inorganic phosphorus but the latter was easily soluble and available to plants. On the basis of the capacity and intensity factors determined according to the method by Teräsvuori and also on the basis of inorganic phosphorus extractable by water fairly reliable predictions could be made of the mutual order of the samples as phosphorus supplyer to the plants in the pot experiment. In an incubation experiment at 27°C the amounts of organic phosphorus mineralized during the period of four months were in some of the samples quite marked, even 40 mg/l, and in most of the samples they corresponded to 5 to 15 per cent of the organic phosphorus. The amounts of phosphorus taken up by the oat crops under the favourable conditions of the pot experiment varied from 11 to 60 mg/l or from 20 to 120 kg/ha.",

Ces., in the experiments with winter wheat both F. nivale and the Typhula spp. fungi, T. itoana Imai and T. idahoensis Remsb. The pentachloronitrobenzene compounds PCNB and the organic mercury compounds phenylmercuryacetate (PMA) and phenylmercurysalicylate (PMS) were effective against both the Fusarium and the Typhula fungi in the experiments in which the treatments of the seedlings had been performed in November under weather conditions normal for South Finland. The effect of treatments performed correspondingly earlier in October was slighter. In experiments made in South Finland in the winter 1955—56 and in the winter 1957—58, when low-temperature parasitic fungi appeared in abundance, the increases in yield due to treatment of the seedlings with PCNB and with the mercury compounds PMA and PMS performed in November were very considerable; winter rye (7 tests) 12—122 per cent, winter wheat (4 tests) 31—735 per cent, and winter barley (one test) 124 per cent. – In the experiments made in 1956—57 in South Finland no increase in yield was obtained through treatment of the seedlings because low-temperature fungi did not appear. The mercury compounds PMA and PMS when applied on the stands in autumn were more effective against low-temperature parasitic fungi on winter cereals than the PCNB preparations. The effect of zineb and hexachloronitrobenzene (HCNB) preparations in controlling low-temperature parasitic fungi on winter cereals by treating the stands in autumn was found to be much slighter than the effect of PCNB and of the organic mercury fungicides. The amount of active ingredient in the PCNB preparations was in most experiments 5 kg per hectare. In the two PMA preparations used in the experiments the amount of active ingredient was 125 and 425 kg per hectare, the corresponding amounts of Hg were 75 and 212.5 g per hectare. The amount of active ingredient in the two PMS preparations was 235 and 470 g per hectare, the corresponding amounts of Hg were 110.5 and 221 g per hectare. In the experiment on seed dressing with winter rye in 1955—56 it was ascertained that in addition to the organic mercury preparations also the thiram preparation was effective against Fusarium mould. In seed dressing experiments in Finland considerable increases in yield especially of winter rye have been obtained by using organic mercury compounds when the seed has been normally germinating and not infested by mould. This shows that the small amount of mercury that accompanies the seed into the soil is effective in controlling the low-temperature fungi during the winter.",

    "abstract": "In Finland the protein content of the feeds is in general so low that it restricts the milk yield particularly in herds of high production capacity. This is especially significant for the reason that owing primarily to climatic factors the quality of the feeds cannot be notably improved in this respect. Therefore an effort should be made to change the composition of milk by means of breeding in such a way that it would correspond to the possibilities of feed cultivation in Finland better than at present. This would mean that it should be endeavoured to breed cows whose milk is very fat-rich but at the same time poor in protein, in which case more of the commercially valuable butterfat could be produced on the feed grown on the estate. Since a correspondingly greater amount of milk of poor protein percentage could be produced than that of protein rich milk, the breeding of such cows would not decrease the yield of protein, which is of such great food value, but as great an amount in kilograms of milk protein would be available as earlier for domestic purposes as well as dairies. We have aimed at this goal in our country in general by endeavouring to raise the fat percentage of the milk by means of breeding. It is known that protein percentage does not increase exactly as markedly as the fat percentage, wherefore the protein yield per kilogram of fat decreases as the percentage rises. The influence of breeding would however be incomparably greater if low protein percentage were selected simultaneously with high fat percentage. In the investigation we have dealt with the possibilities of such selection in Finnish cattle, in connection with which we have striven to make clear how much the protein percentage of the milk varies independently of the fat percentage. The material comprises 54 West-Finnish Native cows; the fat and protein percentages of their milk yield has been determined once a month during one lactation. The relation of fat and protein is not the same throughout the whole lactation, but it changes so that at the end of the lactation the protein percentage as compared with the fat percentage is relatively greater than at the beginning of the period (Table and Figure 1). The averages of the fat and protein percentages and likewise the correlation between them depend consequently upon the length of the calving interval. Therefore the said averages have been estimated only on the basis of 2—7 production months. Fy means of these averages r = +0.60 ± 0.09 was derived as the coefficient of correlation between the fat and protein percentages y = 1.53 + 0.39 x as the regression equation, x = fat percentage and y = protein percentage. The individual cows diverge very much from the general rule set by the regression equation, which can be concluded already from the comparatively low value of the coefficient of correlation. The protein percentage of the milk yield of the West- Finnish Native cows diverges at least about one per cent independently of the fat percentage when judging on the basis of the extreme divergencies in the material. Although a part of the divergency evidently is caused by external factors, the role of the genetic factors is nevertheless so great that there appear to be great possibilities for breeding cows producing fat-rich milk by means of breeding but having a protein which would be considerably lower than the present average.",

Environmental degradation can be reduced by intensive production at least on intermediate production levels. Biodiversity of livestock breeds can be maintained with globally diverse breeding goals containing several traits and with national conservation schemes for rare local breeds. Ethical sustainability can be taken into account by improving health and longevity traits. Production must also be economically profitable, otherwise it is not sustainable. In optimising all these aspects, the animal breeders have to lay down criteria for conservation programmes and re-evaluate breeding goals so that sustainability is taken into account.",

Annual hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), westerwold ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. var. westerwoldicum) and straw of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were incorporated into the soil by ploughing in early September, late October and the following May, and by reduced tillage in May. Spring barley was established in the following spring, and spring oats (Avena sativa L.) one year later. In general the grain yield of spring barley after legumes was similar to that after barley, in spite of the fact that N fertilization was reduced by 40 kg ha-1. The two autumn ploughing treatments resulted in a good yield of spring barley more reliably than did the spring incorporations. Because delayed autumn ploughing did not decrease the grain yield, a delaying procedure can be recommended for its potential of decreasing nitrogen leaching. Spring ploughing could be used on all but clay soils. Incorporating ryegrass or red clover in spring by using reduced tillage often decreased the grain yield of barley. Timing of incorporation did not have a consistent effect on the grain yield of oats in the third experimental year.;",

The closed chamber (CC) method was used for the direct and Pick’s diffusion model (DM) method for the indirect measurements. The winter soil temperatures at 2-cm depth were between 0 and 1°C for each soil type. The concentration of CO2 within the snowpack increased linearly with snow depth. The average fluxes of CO2 calculated from the gradients of CO2 concentration in the snow using the DM method ranged from 10 to 27 mg CO2 m2h-1 and with the CC method from 18 to 27 mg CO2 m2h-1. These results suggest that the snow insulates the soil thermally, allowing CO2 production to continue at soil temperatures slightly above freezing in the winter. Carbon dioxide formed in the soil can move across the snowpack up to the atmosphere. The winter/summer ratio of CO2 evolution was estimated to exceed 4%. Therefore, the snow-covered crop soil served as a source of CO2 in winter, and CO2 evolution constitutes an important part of the annual CO2 budget in snowy regions.",

Moderate water deficit and severe drought stress did not affect the developmental rate of the panicle, but the pre-anthesis and post-anthesis architecture changed considerably; leaves unrolled later, the number of green leaves was lower, the internodes lengthened less, and the inflorescence was shorter as a consequence of water deficit. Drought stress decreased the number of fertile florets in the panicle significantly, in the lower clusters of branches in particular. In the cultivar “Puhti”, 57 % of the fertile florets aborted as a consequence of moderate drought stress and 89 % as a result of severe drought stress when compared to well-watered individuals, while in “Virma”, a cultivar of significantly higher yield potential, 80 °lo and 90 % of the fertile florets wilted, respectively. In addition, water deficit caused considerable losses in all the morphological characteristics measured. Further implications of these results for yield formation are discussed.",

Purpose of this review is to evaluate this data against the information available on genetic and environmental factors. Genotype and light intensity highly affect the vitamin C content of plants. Optimal nitrogen level has a small effect, but excess of nitrogen decreases vitamin C content. Genotype, developmental stage of the plant, adequate photosynthesis, vigorous growth and relatively high temperature increase the carotene content of carrots. The effects of fertilization on the carotene content of plants have been contradictory and warrants more research. No research results could be found of the effects of fertilization or growing practices on the vitamin B content even though vegetables are an important source of vitamin B in diets. Increasing nitrogen fertilization, genotype, low light intensity, low temperature and drought increase the nitrate content of vegetables, but the levels are low in vegetables grown in the Nordic countries, except in lettuce grown under glass with the aid of lights during the dark season. The effect of fertilization on the sugar content is small, and the effect on dietary fibre warrants further study.",

Amblyseius subsotidus (Beglyarov) and A. reductus Wainstein occurred occasionally in relatively high densities, whereas Anlhoseius rhenanus (Oudemans), A. suecicus (Sellnick), A. richteri (Karg), A. bakeri (Carman), A. viktorovi Wainstein, Paraseiulus taihii (Athias-Henriot) and P. triporus (Chant &amp; Yoshida-Shaul) occurred rarely and always in low densities. On unsprayed trees, the mean density of phytoseiid mites was 1.2 mites/leaf. On sprayed trees, none or only a few phytoseiids were found, but the density of the European red spider mite Panonychus ulmi (Koch) was much higher than on unsprayed trees. Indigenous phytoseiid mites appeared to be capable of maintaining the P. ulmi population level under the economic threshold on unsprayed apple trees. The presence of the common prey mites, P. ulmi, the rust mite Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa), or tydeid mites was not necessary for the presence of phytoseiid mites. Relatively high numbers of E. finlandicus, P. macropilis and P. soleiger were found, although prey mites were scarce. Many deciduous trees and bushes support high populations of phytoseiid mites. The highest numbers were found on Aesculus hippocastani, Corylus avellana, Fraxinus excelsior, Ribes nigrum. Rubus odoralus, Sorhus aucuparia, Tilia spp. and Ulmus glabra. E. finlandicus occurred most commonly and in the highest densities, followed by P. macropilis, P. soleiger, P. triporus and A. rhenanus. E. finlandicus can immigrate rapidly from adjacent vegetation into an orchard after harmful spraying if suitable plants are present, and tall trees appeared to be more important than low bushes as natural sources of phytoseiids for aerial dispersal. In acaricide tests, flubenzimine was effective against P. ulmi, but it was harmful to E. finlandicus and P. macropilis. A single treatment with clofentezine and hexythiazox, although effective against P. ulmi, was harmless to E. finlandicus and P. macropilis, but repeated sprays of both acaricides significantly reduced the density of phytoseiids. The fungicides dithianon and bitertanol were harmless to phytoseiids, but dichlofluanid was harmful. Triforine sprays also reduced the numbers of phytoseiid mites, but the effect was only temporary. It had a 75% effect on P. ulmi winter eggs when sprayed just before hatching. Dichlofluanid was effective against P. ulmi and A. schlechtendali.",

    "abstract": "Arable soil is a functional unit whose condition is vital to crop production, but also to ecosystems at large owing to the significant role of soil in global nutrient cycles and balances. The soil quality concept recognises the concern for the sustainability of current arable land use practices. It integrates soil chemical, physical and biological properties, and takes account of the interaction of soil with water and air. This paper reviews the soil quality concept and its applications and discusses the importance of the concept for the assessment of Finnish arable soils. Many aspects of the chemical quality of arable soil are already well known in Finland. In contrast, follow-up of the physical and biological soil components, which are increasingly seen as important features of soil quality, is rudimentary. For monitoring of the soil quality at different scales  field, regional, national and global  a suitable set of indicators needs to be identified. In this paper particular attention is paid to the potential importance and usefulness of selected biological indicators. It is clear that more basic research is needed to provide scientists and advisors with a solid basis for transmitting reliable information on soil quality. While the soil quality concept has been justifiably criticised, it has clear merits in the integrated handling of the soil entity and in highlighting the environmental aspects of arable soil quality.;",

    "abstract": "The split application of fertilizer nitrogen and adjusted irrigation were studied at Potato Research Institute in Lammi in 1993-1995. Independent of year, variety or irrigation, the split application of nitrogen had no benefit on yield or yield quality compared to a single dose at planting on the levels of recommended nitrogen fertilization. The highest yields were received with the highest dose 110 kg ha-1 N, given all at planting, followed by 80, 50+30+30, 50+30 and 50 kg ha-1 N. The yields without fertilizer nitrogen averaged 24.8 t ha-1. The adjusted irrigation increased tuber yields 17%. The utilization of fertilizer and organic soil nitrogen was good on potato crop if water supply was taken care of. Some values of apparent fertilizer nitrogen recovery exceeded 1.0 thus suggesting that the moderate fertilization improved the ability of potato crop to utilize the natural nitrogen sources in soils.",

For the development of an efficient monitoring and forecasting system for Lygus densities, low catches of bugs with yellow sticky traps have been a problem. We determined the spectral reflectance of yellow and blue traps and compared their catches of Lygus spp. during five consecutive growing seasons in carrot fields, with additional data collected from other crop plants. Blue sticky traps caught significantly more omnivorous Lygus rugulipennis (Popp.) than yellow sticky traps in carrot fields. Lygus kalmi (L.) that is a typical species in carrot fields, was equally caught by yellow and blue traps. Our results suggest that blue sticky traps are a convenient method for monitoring of L. rugulipennis especially during the seedling stage of cultivated carrot plants when sweep netting cannot be used. Factors affecting the efficiency of blue sticky traps to capture omnivorous bugs and thrips are discussed.",

Half of the experiment had been limed twice with CaCO3 (10 tons/ha). In a pot experiment, six yields of Italian ryegrass were grown in soils taken from each plot, and the P uptake by the grass was determined. Soil P was extracted with water (Pw) and 0.5 M ammonium acetate-0.5 M acetic acid at pH 4.65 (PAAAC)- Reversibly adsorbed P (Pi) was extracted by a new method in which P desorbing from the soil was collected in strips of filter paper impregnated with iron hydroxide. P uptake by pot-grown grass from soils fertilized with increasing rates of P in the field corresponded to 30, 72, 100 and 112 kg larger quantities of P per hectare, compared to the soil not receiving P in the field experiment. The apparent utilization of residual fertilizer P ranged from 16 % to 25 %. The reserve of potentially desorbable P in soil had been affected much more by the fertilizer applications than had P uptake by crops in the field. The ability of the three extraction methods (Pw, Pi, PAAAC) to predict P uptake by pot-grown ryegrass was discussed. The Pi method appeared to be well suited for assessment of potentially available P reserves both in limed and unlimed soils.",

    "abstract": "Surveys of the incidence of flea beetles on sugarbeet and rapeseed were carried out in eight localities in southern and central Finland in 1972 and 1980—83. The first flea beetles emerged from overwintering in late April to early May, depending on the temperature. The majority, however, appeared during the second half of May, when daily temperatures occasionally reached +20°C. Flea beetles found their host plants by olfactory orientation. Two population peaks occurred during the growing season. The overwintered flea beetles formed the first peak in late May to early June and the adults of the new generation the second peak starting in late July. The incidence of flea beetles fluctuated greatly on the cultivation, as the flea beetles moved only short distances and showed thus very local occurrence. The availability of host plants greatly affected their reproduction rate, and thus the annual and regional differences in the incidence of the flea beetles were great and depended solely on the availability of host plants. Therefore it was difficult to establish any countrywide differences in the incidence of the beetles. Only Phyllotreta undulata (Kutsch.) and P. striolata (F.) were of any importance aspests of rapeseed. P. undulata made up some 80—90 % and P. striolata some 10 % of the total number of flea beetles on rapeseed. P. striolata was more abundant on radish than on rapeseed. Sugarbeet was damaged only by Chaetocnema concinna (Marsh). Other species of flea beetles were also observed in small numbers on rapeseed, radish and sugarbeet. They did not, however, cause any damage, but spread from adjacent cultivated plant species or weeds. The suction trap collected only a few flea beetles, but clearly revealed their activity periods. Damage caused by flea beetles is most harmful during the short seedling stage. At that time one flea beetle per plant was considered the threshold level for control measures. Later, even several flea beetles did not significantly hamper the growth. Seed coating efficiently prevented damage by flea beetles. The general incidence of flea beetles observed during this study was so low that coating of the seed was not justified. Chemical control of blossom beetle efficiently reduced flea beetles as well. The abandoning of the cultivation of winter rape also reduced the total number of flea beetles.",

Straw samples (n = 5) liberated significantly higher amounts of spores (3.7 x 106 cfu/m3 air) in comparison to hay samples (n = 33) and grain samples (n = 2), which liberated 0.6 x 106 cfu/m3 and 0.2 x 106 cfu/m3 , respectively. Thermotolerant and thermophilic microflora were typical of the exposure originating from straw. Hay liberated about 10 % and grain only 0.7 %, the level of spores of thermotolerant fungi liberated from straw. The corresponding percentages of spores of thermophilic actinomycetes were 5 % and 0.4 %. Thermoactinomyces vulgaris was the dominating microbe in the exposure caused by straw; Aspergillus umbrosus was the major species in the microflora liberated from hay and grain. Other Aspergillus (A.) species (A. fumigatus, A. ochraceus, A. flavus, A. repens, A. versicolor) and Penicillium (P.) species (P. expansum, P. piceum, P. citrinum, P. brevicompactum, P. echinulatum, P. verrucosum var. cyclopium) occurred frequently, and in great amounts, in all the analysed materials. Spores of Cladosporium (C.) species (mainly C. herbarum, C. cladosporioides, and C. macrocarpum) were found frequently, and abundantly, during the handling of hay. The present results suggest that not only the traditional causative agents of farmer’s lung disease but also other fungal and actinomycete species may be found in high concentrations during the handling of bedding and feeding stuffs, and that these fungal and actinomycete exposures may cause respiratory symptoms and other health problems in both man and animals. Special attention should be paid to decreasing the moisture content of hay and straw before storing in order to lower the risk of moulding during the indoor feeding period.",

The compared tillage systems were as follows: conventional tillage (CT), reduced conventional tillage (RT), conservation tillage I (CP), conservation tillage II (CM), no-tillage system (NT). The aim of the research was to determine the influence of those tillage systems on the energy and labour requirement, and on the yield of the maize and of the winter wheat.

The aim of this study was to evaluate reed canary grass germplasm, elite and wild populations, for non-food, forage and seed production. An index composed of different agronomic traits was used to establish the best populations for each end-use. Populations were also ranked according to biomass or seed yield only. Non-food cultivars have not yet been developed, but results from this study suggest that some high biomass forage cultivars could be used in non-food production. However, local populations possessed a desirable combination of traits, including higher proportion of straw associated with high biomass yield. This study indicated that local populations could be used in non-food crop breeding together with elite material. Some evidence for the potential of populations for forage production was also noted, mainly through leaf area and leaf proportion measurements. High non-food or forage indices were associated with good seed production in some populations. Results help in selecting appropriate cultivars for non-food use, which is currently important as the cultivated area of reed canary grass for biofuel in Finland is anticipated to be 75 000 hectares by 2010.",

Soil pH(H 2 O) and extractable nutrients (NO 3 -N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Cu, Mn) and leaf nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, B) were analysed. The mean soil pH, P, K and Mn were in the recommended ranges. Over 50% of soil P and 60% of Mg results and the greatest part of Ca results passed below the lower recommended limits, but soil B and Cu were frequently over the upper recommended limits. The mean leaf N, P and K on all currants, Mg on black and red currants and Ca and B on black currant were within the recommended limits. The lower recommended limit of Mg was passed below in 74% of white currant leaf samples. Positive correlations were found between soil and leaf nutrient concentrations for P, Ca and Mg. The recommended lower soil analysis limits might possibly be too high for coarse soils, because low values of soil P, Mg and Ca were common. The nutrients also might not be evenly distributed in the sampled soil layer but might be accumulated in a thin surface soil layer because of repeated surface broadcasting of fertilizers.",

    "abstract": "The effect of Cl and SO2-4, anions as well as that of the ionic strength on the desorption of soil P were studied in 102 mineral soil samples by extracting them with KCI and K2SO4 solutions at ionic strengths of 0.025 and 0.1. The quantities of salt soluble and water soluble P in the soils were compared. Both sulphate solutions extracted more P in every single sample than either of the chloride solutions. On the other hand, the material could be divided into three groups according to the position of water in the order of extraction efficiency. In the group W&gt;S&gt;Cl, consisting of 53 samples, water was the most effective extractant, in the group S&gt;W&gt;Cl of 37 samples water was less effective than sulphate solutions but more effective than the chloride solutions, and in 12 samples (S&gt;Cl&gt;W) water was the least effective, less effective than even chloride. The groups classified according to P extractability did not deviate from each other in terms of soil texture, pH or org. C %, but the salt solutions tended to be the more effective extractants the poorer the P status of the soil was. The salt soluble and water soluble P which are closely related to each other correlated with the same factors. Exclusive of the group of 12 samples (S&gt;Cl&gt;W), the highest value sof correlation coefficient were found for NH4F-P/Al, i.e. the molar ratio of NH4F soluble P (CHANG and JACKSON's method) to oxalate extractable Al (r=0.89***-0.93***). The absolute differences between amounts of P dissolved in KCI and K2SO4 solutions of the same initial ionic strength were the greater the more water soluble P the samples contained (r=0.58* -0.94***). An increase in ionic strength tended to depress the extractability of P in both salt solutions. Therefore the ligand exchange between sulphate and phosphate or hydroxyl was regarded unprobable. A theory of the extraction mechanism of sulphate was presented. The greater extraction efficiency of sulphate was assumed to be caused by the exchange reactions with H2O groups which affect the ionic strength in a solution and the electric condition near the surface.",

More specifically,the aim is to build a set of dynamic,theory-based econometric models which are able to capture both short-run and long-run effects of income and price changes,and which can be used for prediction and policy simulation under alternati e assumed conditions.A relati ely unrestricted,data determined,econometric modelling approach based on the error correction mechanism is used,in order to emphasise the importance of dynamics of trade functions.Econometric models are constructed for se en agricultural commodities cassa a,cocoa,coconut oil,palm oil,pepper, rubber,and tea exported from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)to the European Union (EU).With the aim of providing broad commodity co erage,the intent is to explore whether the chosen modelling approach is able to catch the essentials of the behavioural relationships underlying the specialised nature of each commodity market. The import demand analysis of the study examines two key features:(1)the response of EU s agricultural commodity imports to income and price changes,and (2)the length of time required for this response to occur.The estimations of the export demand relationships provide tests whether the exporters  market shares are influenced by the le el of relati e export price,and whether exports are affected by ariations in the rate of growth of imports.The export supply analysis examines the relati e influence of real price and some non-price factors in stimulating the supply of exports.The lag distribution (the shape and length of the lag)is found to be ery critical in export supply relationships,since the effects of price changes usually take a long time to work themselves through and since the transmission of the price effects can be complex.The set of dynamic econometric models estimated in the study are then used to simulate the effects different types of trade policies.More specifically,attempts are made to quantify the effects of a unilateral tariff remo al by the EU,an imposition of export subsidies and taxes by the ASEAN countries as well as exchange rate adjustments on ASEAN agricultural exports to the EU. The results suggest that concepts such as cointegration and error correction specification are well suited for the study of agricultural trade flows,which are typically non-stationary time series.The error correction specification is found to provide a good representation of the data-generating process for agricultural commodity flows from ASEAN countries to the EU.Furthermore,the study shows the importance of inspection of the time series properties and the examination of both short-and long-run adjustment when studying trade functions.The different dynamic responses are often critical to the outcomes of the types of trade policies considered.;",

To one such batch of fertilizer, an extra amount of cadmium was added at the mixing stage. In a two-year field experiment carried out in soil consisting of clayey fine sand and begun in 1977, 1000 kg/ha of NPK fertilizer with a cadmium content of either 57 or 81 mg/kg brought about a clear increase in the cadmium content of radish tops.

The cadmium content of the dry matter of rye grass was lower than that of the other experimental plants, and it appeared to rise less with an increase in the cadmium content of the fertilizer. Owing to the wide range of variation, the cadmium uptake of the experimental plants could not be determined reliably, The spinach, however, appeared to have taken up the largest amount of cadmium, and the rye grass the least amount. The increase in the cadmium content of the spinach harvested in 1978 corresponded to 1.5‰ of the cadmium introduced into the ground during the two-year period through application of the fertilizer with the highest content of the metallic element.",

    "abstract": "To abate the environmental problems caused by the severe acidity and high metal concentrations in rivers draining acid sulphate (AS) soils of Western Finland, control drainage (CD) and lime filter drainage (LFD), and their combination, were investigated. The effectiveness of these best management practices (BMPs) on drainage water quality was studied on plot scale in two locations. In Ilmajoki, where the sulphidic materials are more than 2 m below the soil surface, CD efficiently reduced the concentrations of sulphate, aluminium, manganese and iron concentrations and to some extent also increased the pH of the drainage waters. LFD, in contrast, effectively reduced the drainage water acidity and raised the pH level. Decrease of the groundwater level owing to strong evapotranspiration in summer could, however, not be properly prevented by CD. In Mustasaari where sulphidic materials were as shallow as 1 m below soil surface, the positive effects of LFD recognised in Ilmajoki were hardly seen. This shows, that the tested BMPs work properly, and can thus be recommended, for intensively artificially drained AS soils like in Ilmajoki where most of the acidity has already been transported to watercourses. LFD can, however, not be recommended for as yet poorly leached and thus particularly problematic AS soils like in Mustasaari. This is, of course, a drawback of the tested BMP, as it is not effective for the soils which would need it most. The field data were tentatively utilised to test the performance of the HAPSU (Ionic Flow Model for Acid Sulphate Soils) simulation model developed to estimate the loads of harmful substances from AS soils.;",

A laboratory model of an impact oat dehuller, similar to a commercial device, was used to study the effects of rotation speed and grain moisture content on groat breakage and the storage life of oat groats. Grain of oat cultivar Salo [from official variety trials, MTT Agrifood Research Finland, Jokioinen (60°49'N), 19962000] was dehulled with an impact oat dehuller using rotation speeds of 200 to 500 r min-1 at 50 r min-1 intervals. In an additional experiment, grains were moistened resulting in moisture content ranging from 10% to 18%. Proportion of broken groats and size distribution of groat particles were measured. Storability was determined through analysing the evolution of pentanal, hexanal and free fatty acid content after storing groats at 10, 20 and 30°C for two and five months. At higher rotation speeds more broken groats resulted, but dehulling did not cause any marked rancidification of the groats. Thus, impact dehulling is a practical method to increase the energy content of oat grains on-farm without such problems as groat breakage induced oxidation of fatty acids.;",

The contract available for hedging fixes the price and quantity at the time of sowing for a delivery at harvest. Autoregressive models are used to obtain point forecasts for the conditional mean price and price volatility at harvest. Expected yield and yield volatility are estimated from the field experiment data. A range of coefficients of absolute risk aversion are used in the computations. The results suggest that yield volatility is large and it dominates the price volatility in the optimal hedging decisions of the Finnish wheat producers. The point estimate for the price and yield correlation is negative and has a large magnitude. Thus, a negative correlation between the price and the yield, as signalled by the point estimate, will decrease the optimal hedging ratio since the Finnish farmers do not have access to selling put options when they enter in a forward contract.;",

Proportion of PBS was 0 (PBS0), 33 (PBS33), 67 (PBS67) or 100 (PBS100) % of silage dry matter (DM). The DM content was 559 and 255 g kg-1 for GS and PBS.

Silage was fed for ad libitum intake and supplemented with on the average 13 kg concentrate per day. Silage DM intake was 9.2 (PBS0), 9.7 (PBS33), 9.0 (PBS67) and 7.1 (PBS100) kg per day (Pquadr. &lt; 0.05). The energy corrected milk yield [30.3 (PBS0), 29.8 (PBS33), 30.3 (PBS67), 31.3 (PBS100) kg per day] was not significantly affected by the treatment. Milk protein concentration decreased linearly (P &lt; 0.05) in response to feeding PBS. It is concluded that PBS can replace up to two thirds of wilted, moderate quality GS in the feeding of dairy cows because in this experiment pure pea-barley silage reduced silage intake.",

Unbuffered N KCI replaced Al only from soil samples with a pH less than 5.3 in 0.01 M CaCl2 . In this part of the material, Al corresponded, on the average, to one third of the exchange acidity of mineral soil samples, and to 16 per cent of that of organic soils. The amount of Al was usually the higher the lower the soil pH, but the correlation was close only in the group of clay soils. Titratable nonexchangeable acidity was estimated as the difference of the amount of acidity neutralized at pH 8.2 and the corresponding amount of exchange acidity replaced by unbuffered KCI. In 100 clay soil samples it was, on the average, 12.0 ± 1.3 me/100 g, in 42 samples of silt and loam soils 8.8 ± 1.8 me/100 g, in 99 sandy soils 8.9 ± 1.1 me/100 g and in 57 organic soils 49.1 ± 6.8 me/100 g. There was no correlation between titratable nonexchangeable acidity and the clay content within various soil groups. In the clay soils exalate soluble Al alone explained 78.3 %, in the silt and loam soils 59.8 %, in the sandy soils 6.5 %, and in the organic soils 0.6 % of the variation in titratable nonexchangeable acidity. Taking into account the content of organic C increased the rate of explanation only to 82.1 % in clay soils, to 84.1 % in silt and loam soils, to 83,1 % in sandy soils, and to 63.7 % in the organic soils. Further, adding the soil pH increased the rate of explanation 5.8 to 9.6 per cent units in various soil groups, but considering of oxalate soluble Fe did no more distinctly increase the part of variation explained, except in the organic soils. Regression equations were calculated for the relationship of these variables. According to the partial correlation coefficients and to the β-coefficients, the relative importance of oxalate soluble Al in explaining the variation in titratable nonexchangeable acidity was in the clay soils higher than even that of organic C content, but in the other mineral soil groups it was less important than both C content and pH; in the organic soils even oxalate soluble Fe appeared to be slightly more important.",

In the present paper the results of the root investigations, carried out in connection with these trials, are reported. Fifty-six root samples were taken on four dates during the growing season. The roots in the soil blocks, taken perpendicularly to the fertilizer and seed rows, retained their original distribution during washing and drying. The growth of the roots was stronger than the growth of the shoots of plants in the early part of the summer, but at the end of the summer, when the main yield above ground developed, the weight of the roots no longer increased, in fact it had decreased. There was a close correlation between the weights of roots and the weights of the shoots of plants during the whole growing season. A particularly high correlation was found between the root system and the grain yield. Fertilizer placement and irrigation increased both the growth of roots and the growth of shoots of plants. The relative increases produced by the placement of fertilizer were equal in the weights of roots and in the weights of aerial parts, but irrigation increased the weight of aerial parts to a relatively greater extent than the weight of roots. The distribution of the roots in the top soil was somewhat unexpected. A part of the roots reached the subsoil quite early in the growing season. On the other hand, the main part of the root system in the ploughed layer lay, during the whole growing season, immediately beneath the sowing depth, or at a depth of 4—10 cm. The topmost layer, i.e. the layer above the sowing depth, contained very few roots during the entire growing season, and the main part of these roots consisted of buttress roots, whose capacity for taking up nutrients may be very slight. Irrigation had only a slight effect on the distribution of the root system, while the effect of fertilizer placement was very distinct. The roots clearly sought their way to the fertilized rows, also in cases where the distance between fertilized and sowing rows was remarkably great. On the basis of the results it was concluded that it is important to place the fertilizer at a convenient depth, 5—10 cm, when spring cereals are in question. The horizontal distance between seed rows and fertilized rows appeared to be of less importance.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to compare the colour, chemical composition, meat quality and fatty acid profile of the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of growing bulls housed in an insulated tie-stall, an uninsulated barn or a forest paddock. Two housing experiments were conducted at the North Ostrobothnia Research Station of MTT Agrifood Research Finland in Ruukki (64°44N, 25°15E). The first experiment was conducted from November 1999 to October 2000 and comprised 30 Hereford bulls, the second from November 2000 to December 2001 with 30 Ayrshire bulls. In both experiments the bulls were divided into six groups of five animals according to live weight and the groups were randomly allotted to one of three treatments: tie-stall in an insulated barn (IB bulls, ten animals/individual stall), uninsulated barn (UB bulls, five animals/pen, two pens) and forest paddock (PAD bulls, five animals/paddock, two paddocks). Nine carcasses from experiment 1 (three/treatment) and twelve from experiment 2 (four/treatment) were randomly selected for meat quality analyses. After slaughter, the carcasses were cooled for 24h at 2 °C and LD samples were taken by complete cross-section between the 12th and 13th ribs. The results were calculated across the two experiments and analysed as one data. There were no differences between housing environments in temperature or pH of the LD or meat moisture, fat or protein composition of the LD. Instead, the myoglobin content of the LD was 21% higher in PAD bulls than in IB bulls (p &lt; 0.05). Between IB and UB bulls there was no difference in meat myoglobin content and there were no significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences between housing environments in the colour of the LD. However, the muscle tended to be 6% lighter (L-value) in IB bulls than in PAD bulls (p = 0.09). There were no significant differences in shear force or sensory analysis (tenderness, juiciness, overall flavour) between treatments. The LD of the PAD bulls contained a higher proportion of 18:2 and 18:3 fatty acids compared to that of IB bulls (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the saturated fatty acid (SFA) or monounsaturated fatty acid proportions of the LD between treatments. Instead, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) proportion of the LD was 34% higher in PAD bulls than in IB bulls (p &lt; 0.05). The PUFA:SFA ratio was higher in PAD bulls than in IB bulls (p &lt; 0.05) but there was no difference in the PUFA:SFA ratio between UB and IB bulls. In conclusion, there were no important effects of housing system on the meat quality characteristics of the LD, although according to meat fatty acid profiles, outdoor housed bulls produced meat with a higher PUFA:SFA ratio than tethered bulls in an insulated barn.;",

To ensure the continuation of this production, profitable management practices designed for Norwegian conditions have to be established. Thus a simulation model was developed that integrates the daily feed intake, the daily live weight (LW) gain, silage net energy concentration for beef production (feed units beef (FUb) kg?1 dry matter) and price, concentrate level and price, and carcass price for bulls of the country's five most common beef breeds. In this work the model was combined with production statistics to find general recommendations in the finishing of beef bulls under Norwegian conditions. Among all the five breeds the Limousin bulls had the highest estimated mean daily return and the Hereford bulls the lowest estimated mean daily return from 20 g concentrate kg?1 LW0.75 for the 940 FUb kg?1 silage dry matter, and from 40 g concentrate kg?1 LW0.75 for the 800 FUb kg?1 silage dry matter. Our estimated optimal slaughter ages and carcass weights shows that it pays to more intensively feed during the finishing period for all five breeds. Current farming practice in Norway for the five major breeds studied is that slaughter age is at least two months later with lighter carcass weights than the results expected from following our model estimated recommendations.",

The evaluated concrete materials had different compositions and included different additives and coatings. Contact angle meter, optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy SEM were used for characterization of surface properties. Radiochemical methods and a biochemical adenosine triphosphate ATP method were used to determine cleanability. A specific methodological aim was to examine the correlations between these determination methods. A statistically significant difference was observed between contact angles of non-coated concretes, coated concretes and joint materials. In general, coatings smoothened surfaces and the joint materials were the roughest surfaces, as illustrated by profilometry and SEM. On the basis of the radiochemical determination methods, coatings improved the cleanability of concrete. An epoxy joint material was cleaned efficiently from the oil model soil and from the labelled feed soil when compared to the two cement-based joint materials. According to the results of the biochemical ATP method the manure test soil was cleaned better from a concrete including inorganic sealant than from the other materials examined. The cleanability results of oil model soil used in the radiochemical method correlated with the results of the test feed soil used in the biochemical ATP method. Both determination methods of cleanability appeared to be suitable for examining the cleanability of surfaces soiled with agricultural soils. Only the radiochemical determination gives detailed quantitative results, but it can be used only in laboratory studies. The results of this laboratory study will be used for selecting materials for a pilot study in a cattle barn.;",

The experiment was performed on 96 grower-finisher pigs of (Polish Landrace × Polish Large White) × Pietrain, weighing from 25 to ca. 100 kg. The pigs were divided into four diet groups. The feed compound of the control group contained extracted soybean meal. In experimental groups soybean meal protein was replaced by raw grass pea seeds in quantities of 50% in grower and/or finisher diet, and 100% in both fattening period. The use of raw grass pea seeds amounting to 50% of protein feeds in finisher diet did not result in lower growth performance in comparison to the control group. However, the fatteners fed grass pea seeds amounting to 50% of protein feedstuffs in both fattening periods revealed the highest feed and energy intake per kg of live weight gain, compared to the group feed grass pea only in the second phase of the fattening period. A higher share of grass pea seeds in the mixture led to weaker growth performance and carcass characteristics. Hypertrophy of kidney and liver was noted in the animals which were fed with raw seeds of grass pea amounting to 100% of protein feeds. Also, hyperactivity of ALAT, ASAT and alkaline phosphatase was observed in the animals serum. No negative influence of applying raw seeds of grass pea amounting up to 50% of protein feeds in grower and/or finisher periods on the parameters examined was noted.;",

The singly-housed mink had access from their home cages to extra cages with 20.5 litre water baths. Two short-term experiments aimed to investigate how quickly adult and juvenile mink start using and how consistently they use water baths over 10 days, and whether the extent of the use correlates between dams and their females kits. A four-month experiment was designed to compare the development of stereotyped behaviour in juvenile mink housed with and without swimming opportunity. The behavioural analyses were based on several 24-hour video recordings carried out in all three experiments. There were obvious inter-individual differences and intra-individual consistency in swimming frequency and time. Farmed minks motivation to swim can be assessed in short-term experiments, and measurement of water losses from the swimming baths and use of instantaneous sampling with 10 min sampling intervals provide quite reliable measures of the amount of swimming. The bath use of the juveniles correlated with that of their dams, indicating that an individual minks eagerness to swim may have a genetic component. The lower amount of stereotyped behaviour in mink housed with water baths indicates that long-term access to baths may alleviate frustration in singly-housed juvenile farmed mink.;",

    "abstract": "In the present studies various drying procedures were investigated and compared to freeze-drying. The persistence of sugars in some of the dried samples was also investigated. In addition, the effect of some organic acids or their salts on fructose during heating was investigated. The following results were obtained: A drying temperature exceeding 40° caused sugar losses at least in some of the plant materials. Brassica species were found to be the most sensitive to heat. The sugar content remained practically the same in vacuum drying at 40° as in freezedrying. Drying at 40° must be carried out in the absence of oxygen. During vacuum drying at 70°, oxalic, citric and malic acids – even in concentrations of only 1 % –produced a considerable decrease in the reducing activity of fructose; oxalic acid had the same effect even at 40°. The dry matter loss was not so serious. When grass samples, vacuum dried at 70°, were subsequently kept at room temperature, and when similar samples, freeze-dried, were kept at about —8°, their sugar contents after 4 months of storage were the same as immediately after drying.",

The highest content of total and soluble oxalates (105 and 82 mg 100 g-1 fresh matter) was found in beetroot. The lowest proportion (55%) of soluble oxalates was noted in celeriac; this proportion was higher in the remaining vegetables, being broadly similar for each of them. Blanching brought about a significant decrease in total and soluble oxalates in fresh vegetables. Cooking resulted in a higher loss of oxalates. The level of oxalates in products prepared for consumption directly after freezing approximated that before freezing. Compared with the content before freezing, vegetables prepared for consumption by cooking after frozen storage contained less oxalates, except for total oxalates in parsnip and soluble oxalates in beetroot and celeriac. The highest ratio of oxalates to calcium was found in raw beetroot; it was two times lower in raw carrot; five times lower in raw celeriac; and eight times lower in raw parsnip. These ratios were lower after technological and culinary processing. The percentage of oxalate bound calcium depended on the species; this parameter was not significantly affected by the procedures applied. The true retention of oxalates according to Judprasong et al. (2006) was lower than retention calculated taking its content in 100 g fresh matter into account.;",

In these the non-cellulosic compounds are tried to be removed as thoroughly as possible without decomposing the cellulose. However, the preparations obtained still contain different non-cellulosic components for which corrections must be made. In the method proposed by the authors a crude cellulose preparation is produced by a relatively mild treatment, and corrections are made for crude lignin and pentosans. The main feature in producing the crude cellulose preparation is shaking the samples with 3N NaOH solution in pressure bottles in a boiling water bath. The method appears to give readable results for fodder materials. For woods the results are evidently too high, especially due to mannan in the crude cellulose.",

A total of 100 trials with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and 47 trials with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were used to parameterise prediction models for EONR based on yields in plots with no nitrogen (N) fertilisation, intended to reflect N mineralisation, and yields in plots with a high N rate, aimed as a proxy variable for yield potential, i.e. a modification of the delta yield (∆Y) approach. When the prediction models were applied to new sites and years, predictions had mean absolute error (MAE) = 10 kg N ha-1 for wheat and = 9 kg N ha-1 for barley. Performing modified ∆Y experiments can complement current N fertilisation trials with many rates, in order to improve the spatial representation of EONR estimations. Moreover, ∆Y experiments can potentially be used for in-season EONR estimation, in which case the accuracy of the EONR predictions depends also on the uncertainty in yield predictions made at the time of supplementary fertilisation.",

The UB bulls spent more time in lying, ruminating, oral explorative and manipulative behaviour and rubbing and less time foraging and walking than the PAS bulls. The UB bulls performed more social licking and oral manipulation of objects and less mounting than the PAS bulls. These differences resulted most probably from the different feeding regimes and different space allowances.",

In this study the content and stability of natural vitamins and antioxidants were investigated in two fruit beverages made from rose hip powder, sea buckthorn berry purée and white grape juice concentrate, and wheat germ oil in one of the beverages. Beverages were formulated, pasteurised and filled aseptically in Tetra Brik packages and stored up to 35 days at 4 °C or 22 °C. Samples were analysed for the content of ascorbic acid, carotenoids, major phenolics, tocochromanols, total phenols and total antioxidant capacity as ferric reducing ability. The largest changes occurred during the first 5 days of storage, thereafter mainly ascorbic acid decreased. In the wheat germ oil supplemented beverage, α-tocopherol was more rapidly degraded. Negative correlations between the decrease of some carotenoids and tocochromanols, and the increase of some phenolics, suggest relationships of redox reactions specific to the amount of oil supplemented. From the present study we can conclude that additions of oil to beverages should be carefully selected to avoid oxidations of bioactive compounds. Furthermore, packaging of the beverages should be carried out at higher temperatures and thereafter it should be stored at low temperatures (4 °C), which decreased oxidation of all bioactive compounds except ascorbic acid.",

The aim of this paper is to explore the profitability, risk and agricultural policy consequences associated with the transition from tie-stalls to loose housing. Data on farm economics and investments were collected from farm enterprise budgets on 66 farms that have built new cowsheds in recent years in Vestland county. Vestland was chosen because on average it has the smallest dairy farms in Norway, with 45 percent of the herds having less than 20 cows. To analyze profitability and risk we used net present value and stochastic simulation. The findings show that irrespective of herd size, to continue farming with an upgraded tie-stall is more profitable than to invest in new loose housing. For farms with less than 30 cows, investment in new loose housing is on average not profitable and involves a high risk. Unless the Governmental investment grant is significantly increased, the tie-stall ban will have large consequences for farm structure and conflict several agricultural policy goals. Farmland in less favored districts may go out of production, making it more difficult to reach the policy goals of increasing food production, agriculture across the country, biodiversity and rural viability. Our findings are of interest to politicians in countries where one considers stricter animal welfare regulations, as well as planners and farmers who consider investing in new loose housing dairies.",

    "abstract": "Der Verfasser hat neulich zwei Versuche über die Wirkung der Dauer der Melkpausen auf die Milchproduktion der Kühe bei zweimaligem Melken ausgeführt (6). Die Versuche führten zu solchen Ergebnissen, dass die im Mittel etwa 16 kg melkenden Versuchskühe dieselbe Milchleistung gaben, unabhängig davon, ob die Pause zwischen Abend- und Morgenmelken 12, 13 oder 15 Stunden, und entsprechend die im Mittel etwa 20 kg melkenden Versuchskühe auch dieselbe Milchleistung, unabhängig davon, ob die Pause 12, 13 oder 14 Stunden ausgemacht hat. Ein solches Ergebnis ist entweder so zu erklären, dass die Intensität der Milchsekretion ganz unabhängig von der Länge der Melkpause gewesen ist, oder auf Weise, dass diese Intensität während der kürzeren Pause grösser und während der längeren kleiner gewesen ist und dass diese Veränderungen in der Produktionsintensität sich ausgeglichen haben. Auf Grund des Versuchsmaterials, das in den oben erwähnten Versuchen gesammelt worden ist, hat der Verfasser in dieser Veröffentlichung untersucht, welche der zwei genannten Möglichkeiten in der Wirklichkeit vorlag. Die Berechnungen haben zu folgenden Ergebnissen geführt; Das Verlängern der Melkpausen hat, wenn es langsam (nur 5—8 Min. täglich) geschehen ist, die Intensität der Milchsekretion, also die in einer Zeiteinheit gewonnene Milchmenge, gar nicht vermindert, und ihr Verkürzen hat sie nicht vermehrt. Unabhängig von der Dauer der Melkpausen hat man auf die Dauer bei jedesmaligem Melken und bei allen Kühen an Milch eine Menge erhalten, die zu der gesamten Milchleistung des Tages in demselben Verhältnis gestanden hat wie die Melkpause zu 24 Stunden. Die kleinen Abweichungen von dieser Regel, die vorgekommen sind, beruhen offenbar auf Zufall und sind keinesfalls von der Höhe der Leistung abhängig gewesen. Die allgemeine Auffassung, dass das Verlängern der Melkpausen zu einer solchen Steigerung des inneren Milchdruckes im Euter führte, dass er die Milchsekretion verlangsamte, ist also nicht unter den Versuchsverhältnissen zutreffend gewesen. Zur Erklärung der Erscheinung stellt Verfasser die Theorie dar, dass die Kühe im allgemeinen stets über unbenutzte, nicht arbeitende Euterabteilungen verfügen, die bei Bedarf allmählich für die Milchabsonderung mobilisiert werden können, wobei auch die nötige Zunahme des Hohlraumes im Euter zustande kommt. Da dies offenbar nicht in ganz kurzer Zeit geschehen kann, gelangt man zu verschiedenen Ergebnissen, wenn der Übergang von einer Melkpause zur anderen langsam oder schnell herbeigeführt wird. Dies könnte viele scheinbare Widersprüche erklären, die in den Ergebnissen der auf die Lösung dieser Fragen abgesehenen Versuche bestehen.",

In these the meiosis in the PMC has been studied. In the F2-generation of the former hybrid observations on the inheritance of a number of species characters have been made. The meiosis of the F1-generation in R. idaeus x arcticus is regular. In 83.4 % of the divisions chromosome pairing is complete and 7 bivalents are formed. In 10.6 % of the cells 6 bivalents and 2 univalents are observed. In 6.0 % of the cells the division of one bivalent was irregular. In the meiotic divisions of the F2-generation no disturbances were observed. In the meiosis of R. saxatilis x arcticus varying numbers of univalents, bivalents and trivalents are seen. The trivalents sometimes form inversion bridges and are delayed in their division. Some chromosomes are consequently eliminated and the chromosomes are divided unequally between the poles. The second division is more regular; sometimes, however, a few chromosomes are eliminated. The F1-generation of R. idaeus x arcticus now studied is very sterile. In part this sterility depends on chromosomal irregularities. Mainly, however, it is caused by the fact that the anthers and the pollen suffer from drought during the summer and consequently no fertilization can take place. In autumn when the humidity of the air becomes higher, some fruit formation takes place. This sterility is here called seasonal sterility and it is thought to depend on an unfavourable gene combination formed by the idaeus and arcticus chromosome complements. In the F2- generation fertility is restored owing to the breakdown of this combination. R. saxatilis X arcticus is completely sterile owing to irregular meiosis. In the F2generation of R. idaeus x arcticus a strong segregation of the species characters takes place. The observations indicate that the two species have a number of allelomorphs in common. It is assumed that the inheritance of some characters is connected with the action of several modifier genes. It has been established that R. arcticus belonging to the Cylactis section of the genus Rubus and R. idaeus belonging to the Idaeobatus section have been derived from common ancestral forms at some time before the pleistocene period. The differentiation has probably been caused by a gene or chromosome mutation leading to seasonal sterility. Speciation has then continued mainly through gene mutations. Rearrangements in chromosome structure have been so small that the ability of the chromosomes to conjugate has not been changed.",

However, the choice of the appropriate hydrothermal processing is critical to sustain the nutritional values and cytoprotective activities, as Brussels sprouts are rarely eaten raw. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of various culinary methods (boiling, steaming, and sous-vide in comparison to raw plant material) applied to Brussels sprouts on the chosen functions of liver and intestinal cell lines (HepG2 and Caco-2, respectively): the markers of enterocyte differentiation (alkaline phosphatase and sucrase-isomaltase activities and protein level), glutathione store management (total GSH concentration and Glu, Gly, Cys and Met amino acids analysis) and mitochondrial polarization (JC-1 staining analysis). The in vitro digestates from raw Brussels sprouts had a stronger positive effect on the enterocyte marker enzymes in the Caco-2 cultures as compared to the digestates from the hydrothermally processed vegetables (boiled, steamed, and sous-vide). The sous-vide method diminished the intracellular glutathione stores. Hydrothermal processing, particularly steaming and sous-vide had a negative impact on the mitochondrial abundance and polarization as compared to raw vegetables. Our results suggest that shorter processing is more beneficial to retain glutathione and mitochondrial polarization than longer hydrothermal treatment.",

Across Finland, agricultural TN loading (ATNL) has decreased from 17.4 kg ha-1 a-1 to 14.4 kg ha-1 a-1 (moving 10-year averages) since the 1990s. The main driver of the decrease in simulated ATNL is a reduction in mineral fertilizer use, which has decreased the N surplus in the soils. The TN leached fraction, however, did not show a trend but did have high annual variability due to variations in runoff; this corresponds to an average of 14.4% of the TN applied. The ATNL was considerably higher in the Archipelago Sea catchment compared to other Finnish Baltic Sea sub-catchments, with the lowest ATNL found in the Vuoksi catchment in Eastern Finland. The highest decrease of ATNL was simulated for Vuoksi and Gulf of Finland catchments. In the Bothnian Sea, Bothnian Bay and Archipelago Sea catchments, the decreasing trend of ATNL was smaller but still significant, with the exception of the Quark catchment, where there was no significant change. The differences in decreasing trends between regions can be explained by the heterogeneity of catchment characteristics, hydrology and agricultural practices in different regions.",

    "abstract": "Amidst population growth, escalating food costs, limited arable land, and farmland degradation, the adoption of innovative technologies—like organic waste recycling and nutrient recovery—is crucial for enhancing the resilience of global agri-food systems. Nitrogen-Enriched Organic fertilizer (NEO) is produced using a new method, where dinitrogen (N2) is captured from the air through a plasma process and mixed with slurries or digestates as nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-). This process leads to solid slurry acidification and a high NO2- content, potentially yielding toxic inorganic or organic N compounds. This study investigated the impact of NEO derived from cattle slurry and biogas digestate on soil nitrification—conversion of NH4+ to NO2- and NO3- by aerobic autotrophic bacteria and archaea. We investigated and compared the potential nitrification rates in soil samples from two agricultural trials (cereal and grass) treated with NEO and other fertilizers after two consecutive fertilization years. Additionally, we examined the immediate nitrification response to NEO through 73-hour soil incubations. Our results revealed that NEO significantly stimulated nitrification rates in agitated soil slurries, regardless of the feedstock used, surpassing rates observed in ammonium controls. Similarly, this pattern was also observed in loosely placed soil samples, with high nitrification rates occurring with NEO and ammonium chloride. Interestingly, the differences in nitrification rates between field-fertilized soil samples were minimal and inconsequential, suggesting that while NEO exhibits a rapid boost in nitrification rates shortly after application, this effect is not sustained ≈ six months after fertilization under field conditions. Consequently, NEO indicates its potential as an environmentally benign fertilizer without adversely affecting soil nitrification.",

Twelve barley batches were formed from three varieties (two-rowed Kustaa and six-rowed Arra and Pokko) grown on mould or clay soil and fertilized with either a low or normal level of N (43 or 71 kg N/ha to mould soil and 76.5 or 110 kg N/ha to clay soil). In the growth experiment all the diets contained similar amounts of barley and soya bean meal (845/120 g/kg). Variety Arra contained 21 g/kg more CP than did Pokko or Kustaa. The N fertilizer supply slightly increased the CP content of the barley samples (133 vs. 141 g/kg) but decreased the amount of lysine in the protein (31 vs. 29 g/ 160g N). Regression equation showed that CP and β-glucan were positively and neutral detergen fibre content negatively related to the in vitro digestibility of N in barley samples. The content of CP and the in vitro digestibilities of dry matter and N were highest in var. Arra. The daily gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the pigs on Arra-based diets was better than that of those on Kustaa or Pokko (P",

The dual approach of the neoclassical production and cost theory is applied. A system of derived demand and cost functions is estimated using a representative dairy farm data and panel data of bookkeeping Finnish dairy farms. The flexible translog cost function is utilized to solve the empirical research problem. The cost function study is chosen, because it makes it possible to study production of farms operating in the area of decreasing average costs. According to the results, inputs are for the most part substitutes with each other. With the existing production technology, the substitution of inputs for other inputs is inelastic. The own price elasticities are also inelastic. Technical change is purchased feed-saving and other inputs-using. The average annual rate of technical change was 1.3 percent. The new production chains resulting from technical change have made it possible to increase the size of dairy farms. Increasing the size of dairy farms should be allowed so in order to make it possible to utilize the advantages related to the economies of size.",

    "abstract": "The study was concerned with the estimation of food-demand parameters in a system context. The patterns of food consumption in Finland were presented over the period 1950-1991, and a complete demand system of food expenditures was estimated. Price and expenditure elasticities of demand were derived, and the results were used to obtain projections on future consumption. While the real expenditure on food has increased, the budget share of food has decreased. In the early 19505, combined Food-at-Home and Food-away-from-Home corresponded to about 40% of consumers’ total expenditure. In 1991 the share was 28%. There was a shift to meals eaten outside the home. While the budget share of Food-away-from-Home increased from 3% to 7% over the observation period, Food-at-Home fell from 37% to 21%, and Food-at-Home excluding Alcoholic Drinks fell from 34% to 16%. Within Food-at-Home, the budget shares of the broad aggregate groups, Animalia (food from animal sources), Beverages, and Vegetablia (food from vegetable sources), remained about the same over the four decades, while structural change took place within the aggregates. Within Animalia, consumption shifted from Dairy Products (other than Fresh Milk) to Meat and Fish. Within Beverages, consumption shifted from Fresh Milk and Hot Drinks to Alcoholic Drinks and Soft Drinks. Within Vegetablia, consumption shifted from Flour to Fruits, while the shares of Bread and Cake and Vegetables remained about the same. As the complete demand system, the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) was employed. The conventional AIDS was extended by developing a dynamic generalisation of the model and allowing for systematic shifts in structural relationships over time. A four-stage budgeting system was specified, consisting of seven sub-systems (groups), and covering 18 food categories. Tests on parameter restrictions and misspecification tests were used to choose the most preferred model specification for each group. Generally, the estimated models did not satisfy the Slutsky conditions. The goodness-of-fit measures were good, and, compared to static specifications, dynamics usually provided a better fit. The misspecification tests indicated that the dynamic specification was correct, but some form of misspecification was found. The structural change in parameters indicated that the modelling failed to track a stable preference structure - if there is one. The estimated demand system was employed in projecting the future consumption of food products in Finland to the year 2000. The approach was to choose a certain change in the real total consumption expenditure and alternative sets of relative prices for the forecast period. Four different options of price variables were defined. Three of the options relied on the historical price trends recorded in Finland, whereas one option measured the expected consequences of Finland's possible membership in the European Union. A predicted consequence of the membership in the European Union is that the share of food in consumers’ budget would decrease. The expected decrease is somewhat faster than the decrease that would take place if future price developments were based on the historical trends. If Finland joins the Union, the budget share of Food-at-Home would decrease from 21% in 1991 to 18% in 2000, whereas the budget share of Food-at-Home excluding Alcoholic Drinks would decrease from 16% in 1991 to 14% in 2000.",

The repeatability estimates were high for time traits but only moderate for other trotting performance traits, suggesting that repeated records improve accuracy in genetic evaluations.

Factors affecting seed yield, protein yield and protein content were determined. Efficiency of biological nitrogen fixation in the varieties was evaluated at two nitrogen application levels, 16 and 80 kg/ha. Selection methods for increasing protein content were discussed. The commercial varieties bred during the programme were presented. The effect of the gene af on different characteristics of the pea was the central object of the studies. The ideotype of peas for cultivation in Finland has to be of the afila-type. This concerns cultivation in both pure and mixed stands. Afila-peas gave seed yields and protein yields as high as the leafed ones. The lodging of afila-peas throughout the generative growth phase was less than that of the conventional leaf types. In mixed cropping the most suitable afila-peas generally formed almost completely unlodged stands together with cereals. The best seed yields were given by the varieties with a stem height of 61 to 94 cm. Due to competition, the corresponding height in mixed stands ranged from 80 to 100 cm. For the same reason, varieties to be used in mixed stands must possess a fairly large seed size and fast growth rate after emergence. The optimum flowering period lasted from 19 to 28 days. The varieties must be early, with a growing time from 91 to 101 days. Late varieties are not adapted to northern conditions, giving low yields and poor quality. The mean yield of the varieties was 4500 kg/ha in pure stands. The high nitrogen application level of 80 kg/ha did not increase pea yield in comparison with the 16 kg/ha level. In contrast, it enhanced the protein content by 1 % and the protein yield slightly. In mixed stands the mean total yield was 4700kg/ha. The hectare yields of crude protein reached levels of 990 and 900 kg respectively. Early varieties tend to have a low protein content. The protein content ranged from 15.4 to 27.6 per cent in the unselected line material. A negative, although weak correlation was found between seed yield and protein content. A variety with the highest protein yield must exceed the average level both in seed yield and protein content. The varieties with the highest protein yields had a content of 23—27 per cent.",

    "abstract": "Crop yields between 1982 and 1988 are reported here as a part of a cropping system experiment carried out at Suitia, Southern Finland. The soil was silty clay. There were four conventional and four organic systems: conventional cropping systems for barley monoculture, cereal production, diverse plant production, or a cattle farm, and organic cropping systems either for plant production with or without composting, or for cattle farms with or without composting. The crop sequences were fixed by six-year rotations, carried out in two phases. There were great differences in yields between the years, and the organic cropping systems were more negatively affected by poor growing conditions than the conventional ones. In the organic systems, the barley yields in 1985 and in 1988 were 25 % of the yields obtained from conventional stands, when the latter yielded about 3 t/ha. In better years, barley in the organic plant production yielded 50 % of the yield obtained in conventional barley monoculture (6 t/ha). It was not possible to differentiate between the effects of two different causes the preceeding crop and annual variation. The yields obtained with ’organic’ winter wheat and oats (+ Vicia faba) were 40 % of those from the respective conventional pure stands. The clover-grass leys of the organic systems yielded as much as the conventional grass leys until they were destroyed by water and the resulting ice cover during winter. Compared to those of ‘conventional’ system, the ‘organic’ system gave annual mean yields of potato varying from 37 % of the 16 t/ha obtained conventionally to 48% of the 21 t/ha obtained conventionally. Barley variety was found to interact with cropping system in 1988, a year characterised by draught stress. In 1989, in a separate trial carried out on the same field, an interaction between soil wetness (location) and cropping system was observed. Wetness of soil in winter seemed to interfere more severely in the organic system than in the conventional one. Because the uncontrolled variation of the field itself as to topography and drainage makes the comparisons between the organic and the conventional systems somewhat biased and unreliable, these results should not be generalised to cover the overall question of yield level in organic cropping.",

Protein supplements significantly increased concentrations of peptide N (P=0.009)and total SNAN (P =0.03)fractions in omasal digesta.Peptide constituted the largest proportion of SNAN flow into the omasum indicating that hydrolysis of peptides to amino acids is the most limiting step in rumen proteolysis.The microbial contribution to SNAN was on an average 0.64 indicating that a large proportion of SNAN flow leaving the rumen was of microbial origin.The estimated SNAN flow per kg dry matter intake from the basal diet and protein supplemented diets indicated that approximately 49,22 and 37 g kg-1 of fishmeal,soybean meal and maize gluten meal protein, respectively, escaped from ruminal degradation as SNAN.;",

In this study, the concentrations of ammonium acetate extractable phosphorus (P AAAc )and mineral nitrogen (NH 4-N and NO 3-N) in soil and the quality of percolation water from an open feedlot were studied in eastern Finland in 19972000. In each of four pens (9751300 m2) eight suckler cows were fed in winter from 1995 in the case of the first two pens and from 1996 in the remaining two. The suckler cows usually stayed in the front part of the feedlot. Therefore the nutrient loading was also the highest in this part of the lot. When the pens had been used for 12 winters, the mean contents of PAAAc, NH 4-N and NO 3-N in the surface soil (05 cm)were 14,73 and 3.0 mg l1 respectively, compared to only 3.0, 4.2 and 0.06 mg l1 in the control forested area. In the front part of a 1-m-deep soil layer, the mean amounts of NH 4-N, and NO 3-N were 410 and 28 kg ha1 respectively after 12 years of use of the feedlot. In percolation water, too, the mean concentrations of total phosphorus and total nitrogen were high in the front part: 1.7 28 and 2101400 mg l1 respectively. The minimum requirement is cleaning of the dung, and even then loading may be substantial.;",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of vegetative filter strips to reduce erosion was assessed by simulation modelling in two catchments located in different parts of Finland. The areas of high erosion risk were identified by a Geographical Information System (GIS) combining digital spatial data of soil type, land use and field slopes. The efficiency of vegetative filter strips (VFS) was assessed by the ICECREAM model, a derivative of the CREAMS model which has been modified and adapted for Finnish conditions. The simulation runs were performed without the filter strips and with strips of 1 m, 3 m and 15 m width. Four soil types and two crops (spring barley, winter wheat) were studied. The model assessments for fields without VFS showed that the amount of erosion is clearly dominated by slope gradient. The soil texture had a greater impact on erosion than the crop. The impact of the VFS on erosion reduction was highly variable. These model results were scaled up by combining them to the digital spatial data. The simulated efficiency of the VFS in erosion control in the whole catchment varied from 50 to 89%. A GIS-based erosion risk map of the other study catchment and an identification carried out by manual study using topographical paper maps were evaluated and validated by ground truthing. Both methods were able to identify major erosion risk areas, i.e areas where VFS are particularly necessary. A combination of the GIS and the field method gives the best outcome.",

Although the mechanisms involved are well known, more research is needed to relate soil aeration status to plant growth. The effects of reduced oxygen supply on soil respiration and the growth of barley seedlings were studied in pot experiments with fine sand soil, where the soil air composition was varied by flushing the soil with gas streams containing 0%, 2%, 6%, 10% or 20% O2 independently of compactness (bulk density 1.4, 1.6 Mg m-3) and wetness (air space 0-5%, &gt;5%). Plant growth decreased only at 0-2% O2 in the loose moist soil but as early as 20% O2 in the wet soil. Soil compaction impaired plant growth regardless of wetting and aeration. In the loose moist soil cropped with barley, the respiration rate (emission of CO2) did not decrease at 6% O2 but decreased clearly at 0-2% O2. The results compared fairly well with the critical oxygen concentrations calculated by a simple multicylindrical model, in which the water-film thickness around the roots was estimated using soil water retention data.",

The present article deals with preliminary studies on the effects of some LAB inocula (Lactobacillus alimentarius or Pediococcus pentosaceus) on fermenting sour cabbage. The effect of LAB on yeast growth, a problem in sour vegetables, was also studied through the use of dual yeast and LAB inocula. The pH of cabbage juice decreased to levels under pH 4 during the first 10 days of fermentation, which is near the final values, pediococci decreasing the pH to the lowest values. The LAB count in inoculated cabbages increased by 0.5-2.0 log cfu (colony forming unit) /g during the first 10 days of fermentation and thereafter decreased. Pediococci formed predominant part of microbial flora almost in all experimental batches. In cabbage challenged with yeasts, yeast counts rose only when the pH was &lt; 3.5. Yeasts appeared almost regularly also in cabbages inoculated only with LAB. Pediococci fermented cabbage effectively decreasing the pH to lower levels than lactobacilli or natural LAB. However, too strong a decrease in pH may result in a decrease of LAB count which may subsequently lead to yeast growth. The yeast problem could not be solved with the LAB inocula used in our study.;",

The stand types were monocrops and replacement series of mixtures with 2/3 and 1/3 or 1/3 and 2/3 of oats (Avena sativa) and faba bean (Vicia faba), respectively. In one of the experiments control of R. padi, by means of deltamethrin sprayings, was an additional experimental factor having two levels. The height of stems or the above ground biomass of oats either were not affected or were increased by crop diversification. Bean plants remained smaller in the mixtures than in the monocrop. In plant size, there was a significant interaction between stand type and the effect of aphicide spraying: Oat benefitted most from being grown in the mixture containing most bean, and there was an indication (not statistically significant) that in these mixtures bean had proportionately higher weight loss. This result was interpreted as giving some support to the hypothesis of interspecific compensation between oats and bean against aphid damage to oats. In oats, the content of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg all decreased from the stage of inflorescence emergence to the stage of the onset of milk development. Mixed cropping increased the content in oats of all these nutrients except Ca. At the same time, contents of P and K in bean were decreased. The changes in growth form and composition in oats induced by intercropping are discussed from the point of view of host plant relationship and damage function of the aphid pest. In terms of relative yield total (RYT), there was no overyielding in the dry matter, and in one case only was there overyielding in the nitrogen. During the period of population growth of R. padi, the daily maximum temperatures within the canopy were higher in the mixtures than in the monocrop of oats.",

The profit functions are production line-specific, and the endogenous choice of production line is controlled for by a switching-type Probit-model. The results suggest that the small parcel size and their long distances from the compound significantly affect the farmer choice of allocating most land either to grass or to grain. The endogenous choice of line of production also has significant statistical implications in relation to profits, output supplies and input demand. Small parcel size was found to increase costs significantly by hindering farmers from adopting the most efficient production technologies and practices. The ongoing rapid structural development in Finnish agriculture implies that the constraints imposed by small parcels of land are becoming more and more costly. Grassland farming is predicted to loose its comparative advantage in the most fragmented agricultural areas, as farm sizes increase further. Operations to re-structure parcels of land amongst a group of neighbouring farms, although often costly and time consuming, will generate high returns.",

For instance, the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) emphasizes cost-effectiveness in reaching good water status in European river basins by 2015. River Basin Management Plans specify the eventual reduction targets, which will differ between the basins. These differences have implications on cost-effectiveness assessments: changing the level of total abatement changes the relative shares of measures in the cost-effective allocation. In this paper we develop a model which determines the cost-effective allocation of three alternative measures to reduce phosphorus loss from fields. The model allows for comparisons with cost and reductions of all possible allocations. We show that, even for homogenous regions, the cost-effective allocation of measures is strongly dependent on the target level, and that using the allocation from one reduction level as a guideline for other levels violates cost-effectiveness seriously. On the grounds of these results we give recommendations for cost-effectiveness assessments in the context of the WFD.;",

Estimates of MAC provide information on how large reductions in Nfertilisation rates should be before other measures are considered. Based on N-response experiments from Croatian field trials with maize, N-response curves were estimated and profit maximising N-doses were derived. Values of NO3-N concentration in lysimeter water from the same treatments were used to estimate an NO3-leaching function. A sample of 20 Croatian family farms was used to obtain records of producer and input prices as well as actual N-doses. Abatement costs and MAC for an N-tax, a product tax and an Nquota were estimated. The MAC for all the instruments are non-constant and increase at an accelerating rate. The MAC for N-taxes are positive for N-taxes lower than 60%, indicating a net return to society. Reduction rates in fertilisation up to this level should be achieved before considering governmental support for other measures. The N-tax has the lowest abatement cost and the lowest MAC for a particular level of reduction while the N-quota has a lower MAC than the product tax when total reduction levels are below 20 mg NO3 l-1.;",

    "abstract": "The potential effects of freezing on phosphorus (P) chemistry in Finnish soils are not well known. We studied the effects of multiple freeze-thaw cycles on soil P chemistry in a laboratory incubation experiment with one organic and one mineral surface soil. The soils were incubated at +5°C or at alternating +5/20°C temperatures for 24 weeks, either without amendment or amended with pig slurry or with commercial compound fertilizer (NPK 2039). After incubation, the soils were analyzed for water-soluble reactive and unreactive P, and acid ammonium acetate soluble P (PAAA). Freezing and thawing of soils during the incubation had no significant effect on any of the water-soluble P fractions or PAAA. The outcome was most likely a consequence of the good P status of the soils, which masked the gentle effects of freezing. According to these results, the time of soil sampling (fall vs. spring) has no effect on P test results on soils with a good P status. Concentrations of soluble P after incubation were roughly twice as high in the slurry treatments than in the fertilizer treatments, demonstrating potentially better long-term availability of slurry P.;",

However, the application of various biotechnologies in rye breeding has been limited duo to its recalcitrant in tissue culture. In order to improve somatic tissue effi ciency, key factors affecting somatic embryogenesis and reproducible green plant regeneration of rye (Secale cereale L.) were evaluated and optimised. In this study, a total 27 rye genotypes including 10 spring and 17 winter genotypes were involved in the investigation. Genotype, culture medium, sugar, gel agent and auxin infl uenced somatic embryogenesis of immature embryo signifi cantly. One-two weeks cold pretreatment of young embryo enhanced somatic embryogenesis and green plant regeneration. In culture of immature embryos, infl orescences and leaf segments of the seedlings, explants signifi cantly infl uenced the culture effi ciency. Highest embryogenic callus yield resulted from rye immature embryo as explant compared to young infl orescence and leaf segment of seedling. Developmental stage of embryo played an important role in somatic embryogenesis. Late spherical coleoptile stage (embryo size 0.51mm in length) was optimal developmental stage of immature embryo for culture. Morphogenetic potential of embryogenic callus decreased with an increasing number of subcultures, and this ability could be maintained in vitro for a maximum of 8 months of culturing.;",

This has caused a variety of environmental problems. The aim of this study was to determine the concentration levels and spatial distribution of sulphur, carbon and metals [titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese (Mn), iron, cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn)] in these sediments, in order to increase the geochemical understanding of the parent materials from which acid sulphate soil develops. Sediment samples were collected at 317 sites from a depth of 1.53 m. While the sediments have high S (sulphide) concentrations (median = 0.54%) and thus a strong acidification potential, they carry transition metals mainly in smallsized silicates close to background concentrations far below contamination limits. The previously documented extensive release of Co, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn from oxidised and acidified layers of these sediments (i.e. acid sulphate soil) is thus not explained by anomalously high natural or anthropogenic metal concentrations of the soils/sediments, but by an inherent highly mobile metal pool. Spatial-distribution maps highlight areas of elevated S and Mn concentrations, where it is likely that ditching and subsequent oxidation will result in an exceptionally large release of protons and Mn respectively.;",

Regional specialization of agricultural production along with differences in climate and soil properties were expected to generate differences in weed communities between south and northwest. Total and average numbers of species were higher in the south than in the northwest (33 vs. 26 and 15.6 vs. 10.0, respectively). Some rare species (e.g. Papaver dubium) were found in the south. Fumaria officinalis and Lamium spp. were found only in the south. The densities and dry weights of Lapsana communis, Myosotis arvensis, Polygonum aviculare, Tripleurospermum inodorum and Vicia spp. were higher in the south, while the densities and dry weights of Elymus repens, Persicaria spp. and Spergula arvensis were higher in the northwest. Total density of weeds did not differ between south and northwest (average = 565 vs. 570 shoots m-2, respectively). Total dry weight of weeds was higher in the northwest compared with the south (average = 1594 vs. 697 kg ha-1, respectively), mainly due to the high dry weight of E. repens. The only variable that was dependent on the duration of organic farming was weed density in the south. The abundance of nitrophilous in relation to non-nitrophilous weed species was higher while the abundance of perennial ruderal and grassland weed species was lower compared with previous weed surveys. This can be regarded as the result of increasing cropping intensity on organic farms in Finland. Different weed communities call for the application of specific target-oriented weed management in the respective coastal regions.;",

    "abstract": "This study consists of 1228 profiles taken from forest soils mainly situated in South and Central Finland. Nine per cent of the soils are located in the Oxalis-Myrtillus type (OMT), 56 percent in the Myrtillus type (MT), 28 percent in the Vaccinium type (VT), 5 per cent in the Calluna type (CT), and 2 per cent in the Cladina type (CIT). Four layers of each profile were analyzed. In the podsolized soils (80 per cent of all cases) the layers investigated were the litter layer (A0 horizon), the leaching layer (A2), the enrichment layer (B1—2), and the subsoil (C). In the clay, silt and sand soils, in which the podsolization was weak, the uppermost sample was taken from the litter horizon (A0), the second one down to 20 cm, the third from a depth of 20—40 cm., and the fourth at a depth of 40—60 cm. The types OMT, MT and VT are found in all soil types. There are no clay, silt or finer fines and samples taken from CT and CIT, while 57 per cent of all cases were in OMT. On the other hand, only 3 per cent of the sand samples came from OMT, while 54 per cent of the CT samples and 42 per cent of the CIT samples were sand. In general, the uppermost layers of forest soils are the most acid ones. The average pH-value of the litter layers in each forest type is about one pH-unit lower than that of the subsoil of the same type. The mean values of pH(H2O) in the litter layers decrease from pH 4.7 in OMT to pH 4.0 in CIT. According to this study, the litter layer is the richest layer in nutrients in forest soils. The differences between the mineral soil layers are small in each nutrient in the same forest type. The average exchangeable calcium and potassium contents in the surface soil increase with better forest types. The average Ca contents of the mineral soil layers in OMT vary from 366 to 1 060 mg/l soil while the corresponding numbers of CIT, CT and VT are 36-117mg/l. The litter layer of OMT has the highest potassium mean value (177 mg/l) while the lowest value (7 mg/l) is found in the subsoil of CIT. The content of readily soluble phosphorus in the humus layer is 4-10 times as high as that in the deeper mineral soil layers. This is the only regularity to be found in the P contents between the different forest and soil types. Dividing the samples into soil type groups, we can say that the higher the mean values of calcium, potassium and pH, the richer the forest type they represent. Carbon and nitrogen determinations were made from surface soil samples only. The C/N ratio decreases quite regularly from 42 (CIT) to 24 (OMT).",

    "abstract": "The effect of irrigation and fertilizer placement on the accumulation of nitrogen in the aerial parts of spring wheat was studied in the relatively dry summer 1969, on the basis of plant samples collected at various stages of development from a field trial on silty clay soil. In addition to 16 kg/ha of nitrogen in the basal dressing, 120 kg/ha of nitrogen was applied as ammonium nitrate limestone, as urea, or as Ureaform, either on the surface, or in rows at the depth of 8 cm. 60 mm of water was applied by sprinkler irrigation, one half about three, and the other half about four weeks after sprouting. Under the conditions of this trial, spring wheat only slightly responded to Ureaform. No significant difference in the effect of urea and ammonium nitrate limestone could be detected. Placement of these two fertilizers tended to increase both the amount of dry matter and its content of nitrogen; these effects were more significant without irrigation. Though irrigation, usually, markedly increased the total amount of nitrogen in the aerial parts of the plants, this was in the later stages of development due only to higher yields of dry matter, since in July the positive effect of irrigation on the percentage of nitrogen in plant dry matter changed to a negative effect. In the grain yields the apparent recovery of nitrogen in urea or ammonium nitrate limestone was estimated to be only about 30 per cent of the 120 kg N/ha applied as surface dressing. Irrigation increased this recovery to 54 per cent, placement of the fertilizer to 42 per cent, and both placement and irrigation resulted in an apparent recovery of 61 per cent. On the basis of plant samples collected two days before harvest, the apparent recovery of nitrogen in urea or ammonium nitrate limestone by the aerial parts of wheat was estimated to be, on the average, 36 per cent from the surface-dressing, and 60 per cent when the fertilizers were placed. Irrigation increased the apparent recovery in the first case to 76 per cent and in the latter case to 96 per cent. Thus, in the field experiment the uptake of fertilizer nitrogen by spring wheat was markedly increased by irrigation and to a lesser extent by fertilizer placement. Both treatments together are recommended.",

The concrete and plastic-coated samples were placed on a walking path on the floor and on a feeding table in a cattle barn. The surfaces were characterized using colorimetric and gloss measurements and determination of topography. In most cases, the colour of the surfaces placed on the floor darkened during the one year study period, whereas the colour changes of the samples placed on the feeding table did not show a similar trend. However, in both locations the plastic-coated surfaces were generally the easiest to clean, and the highest colour changes indicating soil residues were detected on the uncoated and silane-impregnated concrete surfaces. The difference between the locations was also seen in the gloss values, which increased in the samples placed on the floor during the one-year test period but varied considerably between the different materials on the surfaces placed on the feeding table. This field study confirmed the observation from earlier laboratory studies that plastic coatings improved the cleanability of concrete cattle barn surfaces. Silane impregnation was not functionally competitive with the plastic coatings. In general, the cleanability results were in accordance with the results of previous laboratory experiments but the field study provided practical information about the behaviour of the surface materials examined.;",

Urine additions immediately increased soil pH and MRPw, but no such response was observed in PAc extraction due to the low pH (4.65) of the extractant enhancing the resorption of P. The PAc responded to the dunginduced increase in soil total P similarly as did Pw, which suggests that both tests can serve to detect areas of high P concentration. However, water extraction was a more sensitive method for estimating short-term changes in P solubility. In pasture soils, the risk of P loss increases as a result of the interaction of urination and high P concentration in the topsoil resulting from continuous dung excretion.;",

The study was carried out with mail surveys and telephone interviews on the Finnish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) farms. The most challenging investments were in animal husbandry buildings and, as to these investments, the comparison of alternatives was the most challenging stage. For most investments, the planning phase was considered more challenging than the implementation. Before making the decision, farmers acquired information from many sources, of which the opinion of the main customer and the experiences of fellow farmers were the most valued. Some of the products considered were so new on the market that it was not easy to get adequate information and, furthermore, the information given by suppliers was not always accurate. Decision-making was supported by calculations, but qualitative factors had a dominating role. Large basic decisions were made relatively quickly, while details needed a longer time to process. In general, farm managers were satisfied with their investments. Improvements in work quality and quantity were especially mentioned and generally qualitative factors were the ones first in mind when evaluating the successfulness of the investment.;",

The number of electric shocks the animals received from the training fence was recorded continuously. After the training period, the calves were turned to pasture. Nine of the animals were also grazed the following summer as yearlings, and observed before turnout in a smaller enclosure. The calves got more shocks from the fence during training hour 1 than during any of the following seven hours. The number of shocks the calves received from the fence also declined from training day 1 to 2 and from training day 3 to 4. The results indicate that the dairy bull calves learned to avoid an electric fence quickly, even within an hour from release into the training yard. A simple training procedure was sufficient to ensure that the animals could be grazed in and would avoid a light-built electric fencing system as calves and, even after a winter-housing period, as bulls.;",

A bio-economic model of an integrated production system of a closed herd was used. Economic values of milk carrier yield and length of productive life differed between quota and non-quota conditions, but there were only minor differences between those marketing systems in economic values for functional traits. The standardised economic values of the most important traits varied in magnitude between18 to 81% of the economic value for milk yield. Discounting had a substantial impact on the economic value of length of productive life. When defining the breeding objective for Estonian Holstein, the interval between the first service and conception of heifers, and the length of productive life should be included in the breeding goal along with the traits with the highest economic value, milk, fat and protein yield. In the optimum breeding objective, relative weights of production vs. functional traits were 79 and 21%, respectively.;",

Changes in policy environment and changes in costs of feed pose challenges for farm efficiency. We construct a spreadsheet from two modules based on mathematical deterministic programming techniques. In order to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of costs that may be incurred, the first module utilizes a linear program for least-cost ration formulation. The resulting value is then targeted as a cost goal in the second module. This is supported by weighted goal programming with a penalty function system. The approach presented here is an example of how a combination of mathematical programming techniques might be applied to prepare a user-friendly tool for optimal ration formulations. We report results that confirm this approach as useful, since one is able to formulate a least-cost ration without risking a decrease in the rations nutritive value or affecting the balance between nutrients.;",

No significant differences in the analyzed pigs were found between genotypes CC and CT at the locus RYR1 and CD and DD at the locus CAST/MspI in terms of carcass and meat quality. However, a significant association of the CAST/ApaLI polymorphism with carcass quality and meat marbling were observed. The carcasses of AB pigs had significantly higher carcass percentage of lean meat, thinner backfat and thicker muscle, as well as lower meat marbling, as compared with the BB pigs. Furthermore, interactions CAST/MspI × RYR1 and CAST/ApaLI × RYR1 were found significant in relation to all the studied carcass traits. The results presented here imply that the CAST gene recognized with ApaLI may be considered as important in terms of the way it affects porcine carcass quality traits. Moreover, the research has revealed a relationship between CAST and RYR1 genotypes as regards formation of carcass traits in pigs. Follow-up studies, however, should be carried out on larger populations representing all possible CAST genotypes.;",

The sample is extracted with boiling 80 % ethanol, boiling absolute ethanol and cold water. The residue corrected for ash, protein, and, if necessary, for starch, gives the amount of cell wall substances. Determinations were made of the same samples of which Salo in this department, using quite a different principle, has determined the cell wall complex. She determined separately cellulose, neutral sugar hemicellulose, uronic acid hemicellulose, and lignin. Adding up these items Salo obtained the total of the cell wall substances. The results obtained with the new method are in most cases in agreement with the results of Salo (Table 1). The 80 % ethanol seems to be a very efficient solvent. In most cases more than 35 % of the dry matter of the sample was dissolved by it, while only about 0.3 % was dissolved in the succeeding extraction with absolute ethanol (Table 2). 1—12 % was dissolved by water. The new method is compared also with the earlier method of Paloheimo in which the sample is boiled in 0.05 N hydrochloric acid. It appeared that the results obtained with the latter procedure are considerably lower than those obtained with the new method. Evidently most plant materials contain cell wall substances which are extractable with a very weak acid treatment.",

This work has been carried out to monitor the natural infection of Rcc in two winter barley cultivars and to follow artificial fungal infection by a PCR-based assay. Using our approach, we could detect presence of the fungal pathogen in barley leaves before the appearance of disease symptoms at early growth stages. Response of two tested cultivars to Rcc infection in the field conditions was different, showing genotype-environment interaction in the development and spreading of Rcc. In harvested grain samples at the end of growing season no Rcc infection was detected. The role of external inoculum, Rcc conidia transmitted from various grasses (Poaceae) growing next to crop fields, is discussed. These results provide further insight into the epidemiology of Rcc.",

In an other experiment, six samples (pH from 3.3 to 4.3) were incubated with 0, 0.5, 1, or 2 per cent CaCO3 also for six months. At the end of the incubation period the soil pH in the limed samples of the first experiment ranged from pH 5.9 to pH 7.5, in the second experiment the highest application kept the soil pH at 6.5 to 7.0. In the air-dried samples the content of organic phosphorus and the fractions of inorganic phosphorus were determined, and the increases or decreases due to the incubation and liming were calculated. Incubation without lime brought about decrease in the organic phosphorus content of several samples, and the presence of lime tended to intensify this effect, although only in a few cases the decrease due to liming was statistically significant. Liming also tended to increase the accumulation of NH4F-soluble inorganic phosphorus. The acid-soluble fraction was often increased in the limed samples but not in the unlimed ones. The alkali-soluble fraction was decreased in most soils in the limed samples, while it increased in some of the unlimed ones. In the second experiment the incubation caused marked decrease in the alkali-soluble phosphorus without a corresponding increase in the other phosphorus fractions determined in the subsoil samples. It was concluded that in these experiments the relatively heavy liming in the first place affected the distribution of inorganic phosphorus increasing the NH4F-soluble and acid-soluble forms at the expense of the alkali-soluble fraction. The effect on the mineralization of organic phosphorus seemed to be in most soils of minor importance.",

    "abstract": "The relation between the P test values obtained by four methods and the inorganic phosphorus fractions of soil was studied on the basis of a material consisting of 346 samples of mineral soils originating from the surface layer and from the deeper layers. Fairly large differences were found in the results between the sand and finesand soils and the clay soils. The Bray 1 test gave higher average values in the former soils than in the latter group, and the contrary was true with the acetic acid test. On the average, the Bray 1 test and the Olsen test extracted equal amounts of phosphorus, the values of the acetate test were very low, and the acetic acid test values were between these except in the deeper layers of loam and silt soils and clay soils in which the acetic acid values tended to be higher than the other ones. The Bray 1 test values and the Olsen test values were closely correlated with each other, and somewhat less closely correlated with the acetate values. The acetic acid values were correlated with the other test values only in the sand and fine sand soils. The variation in the Bray 1 test values was most closely connected with the variation in the NH4F-soluble P, and only in the clay soils the NH4CI-soluble and the alkali-soluble fractions appeared to be of importance. In the Olsen test both the NH4F-soluble and the alkali-soluble fractions had to be taken into account, in clay soils also the NH4CI-soluble fraction. Adding the acid-soluble fraction did not increase the part of the variation in these two test values which could be explained. The acetate test value was most closely associated with the NH4CI-soluble fraction, except in the sand and finesand soils where the alkali-soluble P appeared to be of importance. Taking into account the acid-soluble fraction increased to some extent the part of the variation in the acetate values which could be explained by the variation in the three other fractions. The variation in the acetic acid test value, on the other hand, appeared to depend only on the acid-soluble fraction in other groups than the sand and finesand soils. Less than one half of the variation in it could be explained by the variation in these four fractions or soil pH. It is suggested that the Bray 1 test and the Olsen test would be recommendable for the measurement of the capacity factor of the soil P status.",

The results indicate 12.1% of the farmers with conventional horticulture production were interested in converting to organic. Small farm size, horticulture being only a minor part of the enterprise, intermediate estimated yields, greater intent to grow new crops, hiring labor, having other income sources in addition to agriculture and participating in training courses emerged as significant predictors for the intention to switch to organic production in multivariable regression modeling. These results suggest potential to increase organic production could be found particularly among smaller part-time enterprises actively seeking new crops and knowledge.",

Three years after structure liming, soil structural stability measurements on lysimeters (15 cm high, inner diameter 18 cm) subjected to repeated simulated rainfall events showed no significant differences in turbidity in leachate between the early and normal liming dates.

    "abstract": "Since the year 1947 daily milk yields of Ayrshire cows at the ascending phase have been obtained at the University Farm Viik. In this paper only healthy cows are considered. Because the yearly milk production has considerably increased since 1947, the milk records have been divided into three sequences: the first consists of the control years 1946-47 – 1949-50, the second 1950-51 – 1956-57 and the third 1957-58 — 1960-61. In each sequence average lactation curves have been drawn separately for heifer-cows and older cows in both the winter and pasture feeding periods. The lactation curves have been designed in such a way that both productions and the durations of the ascending phase or fixed fractions of them (1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 5/4) are averages (Figures 1—3). The designing of these curves has been more thoroughly described in an earlier paper (12, p. 162). In the present paper attention has been paid to some of the factors influencing the lactation curve at the ascending phase. The following points were noted. The average peak production of cows older than heifer-cows at winter feeding was 21.8 kg in the first sequence, 26.0 kg in the second sequence, and 26.6 kg in the third sequence. At pasture feeding the corresponding figures were 21.6 kg, 20.8 kg, and 24.2 kg. The duration of the ascending phase at winter feeding in cows older than heifer-cows in the first sequence was on an average 31 days, in the second sequence 32 days, and in the third sequence 36 days. At pasture feeding the corresponding figures were 25, 28, and 33 days. The average peak productions as well as the average of the times involved in reaching them were higher at winter than at pasture feeding. The feeding in both periods was intensive during the second and third sequences. At winter feeding the duration of the ascending phase was generally longer in heifer-cows than in older cows. The lactation tangent at the ascending phase, which is the ratio between the peak production and the duration of the ascending phase (kg/day), was on an average lower in heifer-cows both at winter (about 0.5) and at pasture feeding (about 0.6) than in older cows (both at winter and pasture feedings 0.8—0.9). No significant difference was found in the values of lactation tangent at winter and at pasture feedings. The influence of the condition of the cows on the peak production and the duration of the ascending phase of cows older than heifer-cows is slight, assuming that the cows at parturition are in normal or good conditions. Heifer-cows in normal condition, on the contrary, do not have an average peak production as high as cows in good condition. The duration of the ascending phase of the heifer-cows in normal condition is, however, about as long as that of cows in good condition. Only a few cows in a thin condition were included in this study. The length of the dry period has no great influence on the peak production if the dry period is at least one month in length. A too short dry period before the second lactation has a detrimental effect on lactation. It was found that at winter feeding the mean production of the three first days in per cent of the peak production was smaller in heifer-cows (about 50 %) than in older cows (about 60 %). According to this, lactation in heifer-cows begins both absolutely and relatively more slowely than in older cows. There is a rather close correlation between the mean production of the three first days and peak production. At winter feeding in cows older than heifer-cows, the peak production can be predicted on the basis of the mean production of the three first days by the aid of the regression equation. The accuracy, however, will be only 5 or 6 kg if a reliability of 95 per cent is desired. There is a very close correlation between the production of the tenth day (the mean of the 9th, 10th, and 11th day) and peak production. At winter feeding in cows older than heifer-cows, the peak production can be predicted on the basis of the production of the tenth day either by the aid of the regression equation or by adding to the production of the tenth day the difference between the peak production and the production of the tenth day. The accuracy will be 4 kg for areliability of 95 per cent. In the two latter sequences the most probable value for the peak production can be found by adding 4 kg to the production of the tenth day.",

The authors have used an analysis scheme in which the conventional crude fibre determination is replaced by the determination of the total of the vegetable cell wall substances. This fraction is called membrane substances. The crude fibre is an arbitrary fragment of this total. E.g. in spruce wood the crude fibre forms about 80 % of the total of the membrane substances, and in wheat bran about 50 %. In addition the fraction »membrane substances» is divided into 4 subtractions: cellulose, pentosans, lignin, and other membrane substances. Further, a fraction called valuable carbohydrates is determined by subtracting from 100 the percentages of water, ash, crude protein, crude fat, and membane substances. This scheme has been applied to the investigation of 44 different plant products. A critical examination of the methods used has been included.",

    "abstract": "Protein bound iodine (PBI) and total cholesterol levels in serum were determined from 589 arterial samples of healthy dairy cows in different stages of lactation during a period of 18 months. PBI values varied from 2.10 to 6.29 ɣ %, with approximately 79 % of the cases occurring between 3 and 5 ɣ % and the average PBI level being 3.935 ɣ %. Cholesterol values varied from 37.6 to 494.4 mg %, with approximately 66 % of the cases between 100 and 300 mg % and the average colesterol level being 197.43 mg %. The stage of lactation had a greater influence on total cholesterol level than on PBI level. PBI level was lowest one month post partum (3.65 ± 0.08 ɣ %), but remained rather constant from the 5th to 13th month post partum, varying between 3.96 ± 0.08 and 4.11 ± 0.08 ɣ %. It was assumed that during the early stages of lactation the disappearance of thyroid hormones from the serum may be somewhat faster than their synthesis within the thyroid gland, and after an adaptation period in the later stages of lactation, the thyroid gland is able to maintain an optimal PBI level in the serum. The average cholesterol level of 177 mg % one month post partum was relatively low in regard to milk production compared with cholesterol levels obtained at later stages of lactation. The relatively low cholesterol values in the early part of lactation may have reflected a state of physiological undernutrition or an adaptation of the liver and rumen to increasing milk production. The total cholesterol was parallel with milk production from the 3rd to 13th month post partum. The lowest cholesterol values occurred in the serum of dry cows. Significant seasonal variations were noticed in PBI and cholesterol levels. The highest average PBI levels were obtained in April, May, and June and the lowest at the end of July and at the beginning of August. The cholesterol levels were highest during the indoor feeding period from December to May and lowest during the pasture feeding period. Since seasonal variations of total cholesterol level resembled greatly those of PBI, it was assumed that there are common factors influencing simultaneously both the PBI and cholesterol levels.",

Different additive treatments were made and crude protein and crude fibre content and fermentation profile were evaluated. Consumption of tomato pomace silage by wild ungulates was also measured. Ground maize grains increased the dry matter content and crude protein : crude fibre ratio of tomato pomace. Tomato pomace mixed silage had a limited fermentation capacity with appropriate pH and fermentation acid content. The special baling technology was suitable to form well-shaped bales. In the investigated hunting preserve tomato pomace was the dominant food component in the diet of ungulate species. According to our results, tomato pomace could provide suitable quality supplementary food for large game species.",

The clay and sand employed as soil improving agents had pH 5.9 and 4.4, respectively. The effect of liming has proved to be relatively prolonged on Sphagnum bog as well as on fen soil. In the test with different rates of lime addition on Sphagnum bog, the pH value was found to increase linearly with the lime quantity. Addition of mineral soil has produced a remarkable increase in pH. Its effect, too, has been highly prolonged. In spite of their different inherent reactions, the sand and clay have exerted largely similar effects on the pH value of the plough layer. Stable manure possesses an effect resulting in an increase of the pH value and this value is also increased by calcium nitrate fertilization, whereas fertilizing with potassium salt and with superphosphate or fine-ground rock phosphate did not affect the reaction of the peat in any noteworthy and distinct degree.",

This would seem to indicate a prolonged effect of mineral soil on the properties of the plough layer.

The following conclusions were reached; On a hay+sugar beet pulp diet the mean retention time of dry matter in the reticulo-rumen, and the retention times of lignin in the reticulo-rumen, in the whole digestive tract, and in the digestive tract following the reticulo-rumen are of the same magnitude as the corresponding retention times on a hay+concentrate diet (figs. 1, 2, 5, and 6). The mean retention time of membrane substances in the reticulo-rumen seems to be shorter and that of valuable N-free nutrients in the reticulo-rumen longer than the corresponding retention times on a hay+concentrate diet (figs. 3 and 4). On a hay+swede diet the mean retention times of dry matter and membrane substances in the reticulo-rumen are of the same magnitude as on a hay+concentrate diet (figs. 1 and 3). The mean retention time of valuable N-free nutrients in the reticulo-rumen and, in abundant feeding, the retention times of lignin in the reticulo-rumen, in the whole digestive tract, and especially in the digestive tract following the reticulo-rumen are shorter than on the hay+concentrate diet (figs. 2, 4, 5, and 6). On the hay+sugar beet pulp and the hay+swede diets the retention times are in general of the same magnitude. However, the retention time of membrane substances in the reticulo-rumen is shorter and that of the valuable N-free nutrients considerably longer on a hay+sugar beet pulp than on a hay+swede diet. Replacing a certain amount of hay by concentrates, sugar beet pulp or swedes on a dry matter basis seems to have no effect on the mean retention time of dry matter in the reticulo-rumen. However, a retarding effect on the rate of passage of typical hay constituents (lignin and membrane substances) and an accelerating effect on that of valuable N-free nutrients characteristic of concentrated foods was observed. The said replacing accelerates the rate of passage of lignin in the disgestive tract following the reticulo-rumen on a hay+swede diet.",

The analyses of the hay yields harvested from the third year red clover-timothy ley, fairly poor in red clover, proved that the phosphorus content of the hay from the hyperphosphate plots was markedly lower than that of the hay from the superphosphate plots. The respective figures were 0.17 and 0.21 per cent P of dry matter, while the phosphorus content of the hay from the untreated plots was 0.15—0.16 per cent. Red clover seemed to be able to synthesize plant material equally rich in phosphorus both when feeding on superphosphate and when feeding on hyperphosphate. On the other hand, the grasses, in these cases mainly timothy, took up far less phosphorus from hyperphosphate than from superphosphate. The differences in the phosphorus content of the respective plant groups were almost exclusively due to differences in their content of inorganic phosphorus, or phosphorus determined as inorganic forms by the simple fractionation procedure employed. No effect of the different phosphate treatments on the content of ash, calcium, potassium, or nitrogen in the ley plants could be detected. The results of the present study corroborate the earlier observation that on a ley, poor in clover, rock phosphate may produce crops too low in phosphorus for the needs of domestic animals. The results also emphasize that it is important not to judge the response to phosphate fertilizers only on the basis of the dry matter yields.",

    "abstract": "In the boreal zone of Europe, differences between the four seasons are considerable. Also, the within-season variation in climatic conditions is substantial. This has many impacts on agriculture that are exceptional when compared to any other environmental zone in Europe. All the meteorological data were based on weather observations made by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Likelihood (%) for soil frost (≤ 0 °C at 20 cm soil depth) at nine weather stations, and late snow cover (&gt; 1 cm) (10 km × 10 km grid) were estimated for late spring. Probabilities (%) of night frost at the ground surface (March-September) were calculated at nine weather stations by frequencies of the lowest observed night-time temperature: a) between –2 and –5 °C (mild), b) ≤ –5 °C (moderate) and c) ≤ –9 °C (severe). Also, the probabilities (%) of night frost in mid-summer were estimated (≤ –1 °C for at least five hours). Furthermore, a significant shift from mild to below-freezing conditions was measured in winter as a period of at least ten days with daily maximum temperatures above 0°C followed by at least a 10-day period with daily mean temperatures below –5°C in order to characterize high fluctuating winter conditions. All these except late snow cover constitute high risks to crop production. Deep soil frost may postpone sowings, while in advanced springs, night frost may cause damage. For winter crops and perennials, shifts from mild to cold spells outside the growing season are particularly detrimental. Again the data may have many other applications beyond the assessments highlighted in this paper.",

The determination of parathion was carried out by a modification of the method of AVERELL and NORRIS, using a benzene-water-alcohol mixture and increased acidity in the reduction. The malathion was determined by the method of NORRIS et al. with the modification of benzene used as the extracting solvent instead of carbon tetrachloride. The procedures for the determination of total residues in plants are described in detail. The initial deposits of parathion varied from 0.49 to 14.60 ppm and those of malathion from less than 0.5 to 49.8 ppm, depending on the plant species. The half-life of the residues was 1—3 and 1—2 days, respectively. The most persistent residues were found in black currant; in these berries malathion could be determined qualitatively 28 days and parathion at least 43 days after spraying. Very small residues were found in the steam-juice prepared from black currants. In the preparation of two kinds of jam, 30 and 54 % of the parathion and 54 and 71 % of the malathion were destroyed.

The material consisted of samples from a field trial at the Leteensuo Experiment Station. The soil samples from the ploughing layer were collected in autumn 1956, and the hay samples from the crop harvested in 1957. The hay yields from the treatments with 200 or 300 kg/ha of superphosphate were about 7400 kg/ha, and the phosphorus content of the hay 1.69 and 1.85 per cent, respectively. The treatment with 100 kg/ha of superphosphate yielded only about 5100 kg/ha of hay dry matter with a very low phosphorus content, 0.96 per cent. The yield from the untreated plots was almost negligible. Also the biological and chemical soil tests showed that the untreated soil was almost depleted of available phosphorus. The phosphorus conditions in the soil annually treated with 100 kg/ha of superphosphate were not significantly better than in the untreated soil. An annual anplication of 200kg/ha of superphosphate was able to maintain a more satisfactory rate of available phosphorus in the soil, but only the treatment with 300 kg/ha of superphosphate resulted in markedly higher test values than those for the lower treatments. The total phosphorus content of the soil was the higher the larger the amount of superphosphate applied. About 40 to 50 per cent of the differences between the total phosphorus content of the treated and untreated samples was due to organic phosphorus. The potassium content of the hay was the lower the higher the superphosphate treatment. The hay from the treatment with 300 kg/ha of superphosphate contained only 1.25 per cent potassium. The possibility that potassium was a minimum factor in this treatment was discussed.",

The records made have been treated statistically by comparing different chromosome classes with each other, the purpose being to reveal the possible phenotypic effects of aneuploidy upon the species. It was found that a stringent elimination of hypotetraploid zygotes took place when the progeny studied developed. The effect of aneuploidy was to be seen only in some developmental characteristics in hypertetraploid chromosome classes. The effect was very slight in the 4 x + 1 types but more pronounced in the 4 x + 2 group. The effect was observed as a tendency to a lower growth rate during the active growth period of the plants. Furthermore, a tendency to a retardation of the beginning of flowering was observed, as well as an increased proportion of exceptional, long and short, growth periods in hypertetraploid populations. The vigour of monoploid 4 x + 1 types was fully maintained, and even an increase in growth rate as compared with that of even tetraploids was observed.",

    "abstract": "In connection with the concept of sustainability emphasising the interaction of the economy and nature the material flow accounting (MFA) approach has in recent years obtained new relevance and is presently under vivid development. In this study, the concept of the total material requirement (TMR) of the MFA methodology has been applied to agriculture in Finland. The present level and development trends in use of natural resources since the beginning of the 1970s are described. The objective is to show the feasibility of the approach, to point out the reduction possibilities within the agriculture and to provide tools to set clear quantitative goals for reduction. There appears to be an urgent need to develope new methods, because several of the TMR-based indexes cannot be applied within the agricultural sector as such. Three indexes -direct material input (DMI)/energy consumption, .DMI/use of commercial fertilisers, .DMI/use of biocides  are suggested to measure the resource efficiency and the tempo of change towards sustainability. Some of the problems are directly related to the lack of adequate and internationally comparable data. The study is part of the national ecoefficiency-project with the overall aim to analyse the dependence of the natural resource use from the structure and growth of the economy, to localise the strategic targets of dematerialisation of the economy and to create a coherent and internationally comparable database to be used in developing environmental indicators.;",

Males also had higher body weights and more social contacts than females. The locomotor activity of the animals increased during the breeding season, especially in the case of males. Urinary marking had a significant importance during the breeding season, being most pronounced in dominant males. No synchronization was observed in the heat development of females despite some kinship. Behaviours such as escape attempts, bitings and increased aggressiveness occurred in March-April as a result of increasing social tension combined with reproductive behaviour. Whelping success varied depending on group composition. Some of the non-breeding and breeding females were observed to act as communal nursing helpers.",

Regression analysis showed that heart girth was the trait most highly correlated to body weight (R2 = 0.969). Including body length or wither height as a second term in the regression, increased R2 values only slightly. When the relationship between heart girth and body weight was used to predict the body weight of heifers reared at two feeding levels (experiment II), the precision of prediction was affected by the plane of nutrition. Actual body weight for a given heart girth was slightly higher on the high than on the low feeding level. It is, nevertheless, concluded that the equations presented in the paper can be used to estimate accurately the body weight of pre-pubertal (95-140-cm heart girth) Ayrshire heifers gaining 550-700 g/d.",

The residues of fenvalerate and permethrin in straw approximately 2 months after application varied between 0.1 to above 5 mg/kg straw in 1986, 1988 and 1989, but was less than 0.5 mg/kg straw at harvest in 1991. No pesticide residues were found in straw samples taken in the following summer in the 1991 experiment. The decomposition rate of straw did not differ between permethrin and fenvalerate- treated plots and control plots. The rate of decomposition was slightly higher in sandy soil than in organic soil, but the same on tilled and non-tilled plots. Fenvalerate and permethrin affected the numbers of epigeal Arachnida and Collembola in the field. Araneae were more numerous in pitfall samples taken from control plots than in insecticide-treated plots immediately after treatment. In organic soil the difference was marginally significant after harvest. The abundance of Acarina in pitfalls was significantly lower in insecticide-treated plots than in control plots. In the sandy soil experiment, less Collembola occurred in pitfalls of fenvalerate plots than in permethrin or control plots.

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes alternative agri-environmental policy reforms to reduce nutrient runoff when the government has price support, fertilizer tax, buffer zone subsidy and acreage subsidy as available instruments. To promote environmental goals, the government is assumed to adjust the tax and subsidyrates so as to keep the farmers profits constant. This instrument switch reduces the prices of less-polluting inputs and the farmer re-optimizes his production so that it becomes more environmentally friendly. The four alternative reforms under study are the following: a reduction of the producer price support or acreage subsidy compensated for by a higher buffer zone subsidy, and an increase in the fertilizer tax which is compensated for by either a higher acreage subsidy or a buffer zone subsidy. We show theoretically that although all reforms reduce the nutrient runoff, the last one is the most efficient. Our simulations show that at a 30 % abatement level of nitrogen runoffs all policy mixes decrease the average farmers profits after the re-adjustment, if the end price is not allowed to in-crease due to decreased production. The smallest loss in the farmers profits results from a policy mix which compensates for the higher fertilizer tax by a higher acreage subsidy.;",

Four diets provided either 34 g or 74 g total dietary Ca/day, and were either anionic or cationic. Dietary cation-anion balance (DCAB), calculated as milliequivalents [(Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + S2-)], was -247 mEq/kg dry matter (DM) in the low DCAB group and +34 mEq/kg DM in the high DCAB group. DCAB was formulated using NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4 and MgCl2 as anionic salts. Cows received grass silage (5.2 kg DM), hay (0.9 kg DM) and concentrate mixture (1.6 kg DM) until calving. Blood and urine samples were collected 4, 3, 2 and 1 week before the expected calving date, at calving, the day after calving and 1 week following calving. The results indicate that the reduction of cation-anion balance induced mild metabolic acidosis and increased the ability of the cow to maintain blood Ca concentration.

    "abstract": "Associations between protein feeding and reproductive efficiency in the dairy cow are reviewed. Examination of published data indicated that reproductive responses assessed as days open, services per conception or conception rate following changes in protein feeding tend to be inconsistent. Discrepancies can arise due to between-study variations in experimental design, statistical analysis, sample population size, uterine health, cow age, parity, reproductive management or nutrient intake. Detri-mental effects on reproductive efficiency following periods of excessive protein feeding are often attributed to increases in tissue urea and ammonia oncentrations leading to impaired reproductive hysiology, modified endocrine function or exacerbated postpartum negative energy balance. Examination of data collected from Finnish dairy herds (n = 16 051) participating in the national milk recording scheme during 1993 indicated that milk production was maximised in herds fed diets containing 180 g crude protein/kg dry matter. In contrast, no consistent relationships were identified between increases in on-farm protein feeding necessary to secure higher milk production and herd reproductive efficiency assessed as calving interval, first service interval and number of inseminations per calving. Further examination of data derived from 5 437 herds within the National recording scheme indicated that on-farm reproductive efficiency was independent of large variations in the mean annual urea concentration of bulk tank milk. It is concluded that increases in the crude protein content of Finnish dairy cow rations from 150 to between 170 and 180 g/kg dry matter would allow improvements in milk production to be realised without leading to significant reductions in reproductive efficiency.;",

Also two levels of nitrogen fertilization (50 and 100 kgN/ha) were applied. Two approaches (the replacement series and the linear regression equation) were used to analyse the competitive relationship based on grain yields in two-component mixtures. In three component mixtures the replacement series approach was applied. Both methods showed a similar dominance order of the varieties with Arra always being dominant and Agneta subordinate. The relationship between varieties was independent of the number of varieties in the mixture. Increase in available nitrogen strengthened the competitiveness of Arra especially in the dense, two-variety mixtures. Some mixtures over yielded but the differences were not statistically significant. The yield advantage based on relative yield total or on the ratio of actual and expected yield was greatest when the density and nitrogen fertilization were low and especially when one component in the mixture was a rather low yielding variety (Agneta). The land equivalent ratios (LER) (the reference pure culture yield was the maximum yield of each variety) were close to one, suggesting that under optimal growing conditions the yield advantage of barley varietal mixtures is marginal.",

Relative mobility (REM) values for hordein bands were determined. Genetic background was found to strongly effect the determination of hordein composition of barley genotypes. Those genotypes with largely common ancestry showed often similar hordein composition and were difficult to identify whereas genotypes possessing unique hordein banding patterns had clearly exceptional pedigree.

    "abstract": "The effect of bees on the yield of field bean (Vicia faba L.) was studied in cage experiments in southern Finland during two successive years. Comparisons were made between field cages with and without honeybees and open-pollinated uncaged controls. Effect of shading was also considered. The yield in open plots, which were freely visited by pollinators, was considerably greater than in plots from which the insects were excluded. Freely visited plants and plants caged with bees produced about twice as many seeds as plants caged without bees, and the number of seeds per pod was also higher. The plants were tallest in cages without bees. In open plots, 44 % of the bee visitors were honeybees, 56 % being bumblebees. The higher number of seeds obtained with honeybee pollination indicates that honeybees are able to pollinate the field bean flowers in the conditions prevalent in Finland. – It is concluded that there is little value in introducing bee colonies in small field bean areas and places where bumblebees are fairly abundant. Honeybees may improve the yield in larger fields, where natural pollinators are often scarce.",

    "abstract": "The supply for domestic beef has been decreasing sharply since Finland joined the European Union (EU) because profitability of beef production has been low. The goal of this study is to search for optimal beef management practices that increase returns on beef production in Finland. Numerical dynamic programming (DP) is used to simultaneously optimise feeding and timing of slaughtering. The DP-algorithm is solved under alternative subsidy, output price, and silage price scenarios. At 1998 prices and subsidies, the optimal carcass weight is estimated above 250 kg. The European Agenda 2000 reform is predicted to decrease the optimal carcass weight to 200 kg, which is 50 kg lower than under the 1998 prices and subsidies. This reform will increase farmer returns significantly and its income effect depends crucially on the price of silage. The results indicate also that the reform will result in adjustment of feeding. Particularly, farmers having high silage production costs will substitute feed concentrates for roughage in the diet. A farmer is entitled to a premium subsidy of FIM 200 (e33.63), provided that the carcass weight of a culled animal exceeds 270 kg. But when the Agenda 2000 reform is fully implemented, this premium subsidy is not large enough to supply carcasses heavier than 270 kg. The results suggest that carcass weights of at least 270 kg would require a premium subsidy of FIM 400-800 (e67-134). Rearing heavy animals will significantly increase production costs and, therefore, most of the subsidy will be taken away from the farm in terms of increased costs.;",

    "abstract": "Traditionally farmed silver fox cubs are raised after weaning either in pairs or singly in a traditional fox cage (1.2 m2). However, this way of housing foxes has been criticised because the foxes may have limited chance to exercise and to show social behaviour. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different social and spatial conditions on the welfare of silver fox cubs. The cubs were housed singly, in pairs or in quartets with space allocation of either 0.6 or 1.2 m2 per animal. Behavioural, physiological and production-related welfare parameters were assessed. The results revealed that space allocation had only minor effects on the measured welfare related parameters. With regard to social conditions, the results showed that the possibility for social behaviour is important for the welfare of young cubs. However, the welfare of the cubs may be jeopardised if they are kept in quartets beyond their natural dispersal time. Therefore, the welfare of silver fox cubs could be enhanced by allowing the cubs to enjoy of social companionship during the first months of their lives and by separating them into pairs in later autumn.",

In all three years, disease levels in mixed stands were lower than the arithmetic mean of the pure stands. The yield experiments indicated that under low or moderate disease stress mixtures can buffer yield reduction effectively. However, when disease levels were high, mixtures appeared to be less effective in that respect.

The ewes have a high precocity and good adaptability to breeding season changes. Litter size (LS) is about 2.2 at 18 months and over 3 in adults, resulting from a high ovulation rate (OR) and a reduced embryonic mortality (EM). OR is less variable, but LS as variable as in other breeds. There are 0.8—1.9 % freemartins. In ewe lambs, the heritabilities of OR, EM and LS are 0.39, 0.09 and 0.02, resp. R has a favourable direct effect on lamb viability. Heterosis is high on fertility in ewe lambs, but less on OR and LS, favourable on lamb viability. The lack of performance regression from F1 to F4 in crosses with Berrichon du Cher has allowed the creation of a composite line (INRA 401), used on farms. Ewes suckle a maximum of twins. Lambs grow fast but have a low carcass and meat quality. A good viability of crossbred lambs and a good productivity of F1 ewes have been observed both in intensive and extensive conditions. In extensive system, R ewes are relatively susceptible to gastro-intestinal parasitism but are resistant to hepatic or pulmonary parasitism. R lambs seem to be susceptible to caseous lymphadenitis. Favourable results have been obtained with regard to prolificacy of F1 or ¼ R ewes and viability of lambs in six other European countries, but an unfavourable effect of heavy summer heat on male activity and female fertility.

    "abstract": "In Finland, the breeding of small fruits has been focused on species belonging to the Ribes, Fragaria, Rubus, Vaccinium and Hippophaë genera. Of the blackcurrant, many local varieties have been brought under cultivation during this century, the most significant being ‘Brödtorp’ and ‘Melalahti’. The Department of Horticulture of the Agricultural Research Centre has, by means of intervariety crossings, developed selections combining high yield, upright growth and resistance to gooseberry mildew. A selection with greenberries, chosen from among the self-pollination progeny of the Swedish ‘Öjebyn’ variety, was released for cultivation in 1987, under the name ‘Vertti’. As to the gooseberry, the old Finnish varieties ‘Hinnnomäen keltainen’ and ‘Lepaanpunainen’ are still generally cultivated. In 1984, the Department of Horticulture released the late, cultivated strawberry variety ‘Hiku’, a very good cropper, for cultivation. It comes from the crossing ‘Senga Sengana’ x ‘Redgauntlet’. The most promising early selection, which this spring was released for cultivation under the name ‘Mari’, comes from the crossing ‘Pocahontas’ x ‘Lihama’. In 1986, the wood strawberry variety ‘Minja’ a result of the crossing Fragaria vesca x ‘Rügen’, was brought under cultivation. In the breeding of the raspberry, the Department of Horticulture has utilized the gene pools of wild raspberries; this has produced new selections with fairly good winter hardiness. This spring a variety named ‘Ville’, which was produced in the crossing of the Canadian ‘Ottawa’ and a Finnish wild raspberry strain, was introduced on the market. In addition, the raspberry has been crossed with the arctic bramble. By means of many crossings and back-crossings, the so-called nectar raspberry was developed, of which the variety ‘Heija’ was released for cultivation in 1975 and the variety ‘Heisa’ in 1981. Of the arctic bramble, two natural strains selected by the North Savo Research Station of the Agricultural Research Centre were brought under cultivation in 1972 under the variety names ‘Mesma’ and ‘Mespi’. The cross between them, ‘Pima’, was released for cultivation in 1982. By crossing the arctic bramble with the Alaska bramble, the Department of Horticulture has developed arctic bramble hybrid selections, two of which were named varieties, ‘Aura’ and ‘Astra’, in 1986. They form a higher growth structure than the arctic bramble, are better croppers and have bigger berries with the fine aroma of the arctic bramble. As a result of the breeding work done at the Department of Horticulture, a high bush blueberry variety, ‘Aron’, with a better winter hardiness than the foreign varieties, was released for cultivation in 1982. It comes from the back-crossing ‘Rancocas’ x (Vaccinium utiginosum x ‘Rancocas’). The aim of the breeding of the sea-buckthorn at the Department of Horticulture is, by means of crossings between subspecies growing wild in Europe and Asia, to reduce the thorniness of the bushes and to cause the berries to come off the stalks intact. The release of two selections for cultivation is presently being prepared.",

The objective was to ascertain their distribution and general significance in Finland. The results were obtained from samples of cereals gathered in 2 040 fields all over the country during the growing season 1971-1973. The fungi in all the samples were examined by microscope and cultures and inoculation tests were used as well in laboratory. One of the Septoria species was found to occur on all the cereals, being most commonly on wheat and two-rowed barley, moderately common on winter rye, very rare on six rowed barley and only sporadic on oats. Septoria species were observed to occur most commonly in the southwestern and southern parts of the country, whereas they were very rare in the middle parts of the country and Ostrobothnia. The imperfect stages of the fungi (Septoria) occurred dominantly, whereas at all times the perfect stages (Leptosphaeria) were found only occasionally. The following Septoria species were found to occur on cereals: Septoria nodorum (Berk.) Berk. &amp; Br. was found to occur as the most common species on spring and winter wheat and was moderately common on two-rowed barley. The fungus was found on wheat in 60—70 per cent, and on barley, in about 40 per cent of the localities and for both cereals in 1/3 of the fields that were studied. On the other hand the fungus was found to be very rare on six-rowed barley and winter rye in 610 per cent of the localities and only 2—4 per cent of the fields studied. Also in the inoculation tests it was found that S. nodorum isolates, which originated from different cereals, infected not only their own host but all the other cereals with the exception of oats. The perfect stage, Leptosphaeria nodorum Müller was found only a few times on spring wheat, spring barley and winter rye. Septoria avenue Frank f. sp. triticea T. Johanson was found to be the most common on two-rowed barley in about 45 percent of the localities and in about 1/3 of the fields studied; on wheat in about 35—40 per cent of the localities and in nearly 1/4of the fields studied. The perfect stage of the fungus, Leptosphaeria avenaria Weber f. sp. triticea T. Johnson was found only a few times on spring wheat and barley. S. avenae Frank f. sp. avenae Shaw was found to occur only occasionally on oats in nearly 10 per cent of the localities and only in 3 per cent of the fields studied. The perfect stage of the fungus, L. avenaria Weber f. sp. avenaria Shaw was found a few times also on oats. Septoria tritici. Rob. ex Desm. was found to occur only on winter wheat in about 1/2 of the localities and in about 40 per cent of the fields studied. The fungus was found only in the spring (May to early June). It sometimes attacked fields in great profusion. In the inoculation tests it was found that the S. triticis' isolate originated from rye weakly infected not only rye but also spring wheat and winter rye. Septoria secalis Prill. &amp; Delacr. was found to occur only on winter rye, being moderately common in 1/2 of the localities and in about ¼ of the fields studied. On the basis of this study not much can be said about the magnitude or economic importance of the damages caused by the Septoria species. In addition to Septoria species, several other parasitic fungi such as Helminthosporium-, Puccinia-, Fusarium-species and Erysiphe graminis DC. were observed to grow at the same time on the leaves of cereals.",

Of the cadmium added to the mixture of Carex peat and clay, radish tops and roots took up an overall 3.9 %. In the mixture of Sphagnum peat and clay the corresponding proportion was 9.5 %. In the incubation experiment, differences in the solubility of the added cadmium accounted satisfactorily for the differences found in the plant experiment. It was concluded from the results of the pot and incubation experiments and from autoradiographic tracings of cadmium uptake in radishes, that radishes were able to take up cadmium dissolved in soil water with little hindrance, and that translocation occurred in the plant in conjunction with the transpiration stream.",

    "abstract": "The investigation of meadow fescue as a forage crop was carried out at the University of Helsinki in Viikki in 1975—78. The main objective was to study the rhythm of the growth and yield formation pattern of a stand and the relationship between growth pattern and growth factors during different phases of the growing season. The management techniques studied were the number of cuttings, use of nitrogen, requirements of population density and the relationships of management factors to the changes in the quantity and quality of forage yield. The most important growth factors in the seeding year spring and autumn development were the temperature sum and the total radiation available to the plant and nitrogen fertilization beyond the temperature sum range of ∑ 500° C, respectively. During the production years the most important variables in the spring growth were the growing time, the temperature sum and the total radiation. The midsummer and autumn growth were mostly influenced by the total precipitation, amount of nitrogen for the cut and the precipitation during the week before the prior cut. For spring, summer and autumn growth one unit increase in LAI created a DM yield increase of 715, 500 and 315 ha-1 respectively. Increasing the cutting frequency from two to four decreased the total DM yield 2527 kg ha-1. The protein content and DM cellulase digestibility increased 4.8 and 13.3 % units respectively. Increasing nitrogen from 130 to 260 kg N ha-1 raised DM and protein yields 1 110 and 485 kg ha-1, the protein content and DM cellulase digestibility 4.2 and 1.4% units. The seeding rate requirements for the maximum DM yield were 60 kg ha-1 in the seeding year, 15—30 kg ha-1 in the second year and 15 kg ha-1 in the third year. The management system involving a seed rate of 30 kg ha-1, 3—4 cuts and 260 kg N ha-1 is recommended.",

In Experiment 1, cows on Diet C were offered grass silage and straw and on Diet A grass silage and a fl our-mill industry by-product.

In Experiment 2, cows were offered either grass silage (C) or whole-crop barley silage (A) as a sole feed. Strategy S was carried out by offering 68, 95 and 119 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) per cow daily. On Strategy F, roughage was given daily 97 MJ ME. In both experiments, there were no signifi cant differences between treatments in the cow live weight, body condition score, calf pre-weaning live weight gain and cow reproduction. Strategy F can be practised in the nutrition of mature suckler cows in marginal circumstances. Flour-mill industry by-product can partly replace grass silage and straw in the winter diet. Wholecrop barley silage can be offered as a sole feed to suckler cows with good body condition score in autumn.;",

The experimental diets consisted of five concentrates fed at a rate of 9 kg d-1: a mixture of barley and oats (control), which was replaced either with rapeseed or soybean expeller both at two levels (130, 180 and 230 g crude protein per kg dry matter). A mixture of grass and red clover silage (1:1) was fed ad libitum. No mineral supplements except for NaCl and trace minerals were used. Ruminal digestion was estimated by omasal sampling technique and total digestion from total faecal collection. Intake of all minerals except sodium increased with the level of protein supplementation and it was generally higher when rapeseed compared with soybean expeller diets were offered. Reticulo-rumen was the major site of net absorption of magnesium, whereas calcium, phosphorus, sodium and potassium were absorbed postruminally. Net absorption of sulphur took place both in the rumen and postruminally. Omasal flow of sodium and phosphorus indicated substantial secretion of these minerals into the rumen via saliva. Compared with the published data based on duodenal sampling, the results indicated that omasum has an important role in the absorption of minerals, especially sodium and phosphorus. Omasal sampling technique is a useful tool in studying ruminal mineral metabolism.;",

Using a method termed carrier technology, seeds of spring canola were coated with polymer and sown in winter or early spring. Two types of polymer were tested: water-impervious PoligenÆÊWE3 (polyethylene wax at five rates depending on experiment) and water-soluble, freeze sensitive ExtenderÆÊ (GrowTech at 3% of seed weight). Four separate field experiments at two locations (Jokioinen, 60¢X81¡¦N and Mietoinen, 60¢X38¡¦N) and two laboratory experiments were carried out in 2002¡V2004. Early sowing times were used in combination with autumn control of weeds using non-selective herbicides and broadcast sowing onto cereal stubble to promote cost-efficiency. Such sowing method failed to produce even plant stands, as only few seedlings emerged. The polymer coatings were successful and the water-soluble, freeze sensitive polymer designed to allow an alternative sowing time performed well in laboratory tests. Large numbers of early sown coated and control seeds remained viable until the end of spring. Under field conditions germination or seedling establishment failed probably due to poor seed-to-soil contact. Moreover, unfavourable winter and spring conditions likely resulted in lack of synchrony between adequate temperature and water availability needed for seed imbibition and germination.;",

The hygienic quality of the various fractions of bast fibre plants is of interest in thermal insulations, because it may affect the quality of indoor air. Packaging materials may be associated e.g. with foodstuffs, which highlights the importance of hygienic quality. The aim of this study was to screen the hygienic quality, determined as microbial content, of mechanically fractionated fibre hemp and linseed plants harvested in the autumn before frost, after early frost and in spring. In addition, the possible correlation between microbes and ash was investigated. Two plant species, fibre hemp and linseed were studied. The plants were cultivated in Siuntio in southern Finland during the years 2002 and 2003, harvested in autumn or in spring and mechanically fractionated. The microbial contents of the fractions were examined by measuring the total number of microbes using Hygicult® growing slides. The microbial content of fractions of fibre hemp and linseed varied between 103 and 109 cfu/gdw. The fibre of hemp harvested after early frost or in spring had the lowest amount of moulds, but during winter and spring the amounts of bacteria and yeasts increased in hemp. Mechanically separated fibre and shive contained less microbes than the stalk. Ash contents of all examined samples of stems and stem fractions varied between 1% and 14%. The fibre after fractionating had a lower ash content (2.33.3%) than that of stems (4.46.9%) harvested in the autumn. The ash content of stem and shive decreased to 1.6% during winter, the ash content of fibre being even somewhat lower (0.9%). No correlation was observed between the contents of microbes and ash.;",

The amount of all these cations tended to increase with an increase in the clay content, but variation within each textural class was large, and the ranges usually overlapped those of the other classes. The higher acidity of virgin surface soils was connected with a lower average degree of saturation by Ca as compared with the corresponding textural classes of cultivated soils. No significant difference in the respective contents of other cations was detected. The samples of various textural groups from deeper layers were usually poorer in exchangeable Ca and K than the corresponding groups of plough layer. The mean content of exchangeable Mg was equal or even higher in the samples from deeper layers than in the samples from plough layer, except in the group of sand soils. The percentage of Mg of the effective CEC increased, as an average, from 9 in the sand and fine sand soils of plough layer to 30 in the heavy clay soils; in the heavy clay soils from deeper layers its mean value was 38 ± 4 %. In the samples of plough layer, the mean ratio of Ca to Mg in sand and fine sand soils was about 9, in silt and loam soils about 6, in the coarser clay soils about 4, and in heavy clay about 2.",

Four sheep populations from the central Volga region were genotyped for 20 microsatellites and compared with geographically proximate breeds (Estonian Whitehead and Blackhead, the Finnsheep and an exported and a native population of Russian Romanov) and with local populations in Estonia, Finland and Russian Karelia. Between-breed analyses including admixture analysis using molecular genetic markers and the phenotypic characteristics indicated that the Volgaic populations have not remained pure. The Viena population from Russian Karelia, the Romanov breed and, to some extent, the Komi population, have escaped extensive mixing, making them most attractive for conservation programmes. The study compared imported and native Romanov breed populations and the results suggest that the diversity parameters are markedly similar in these two populations.;",

Shoots collected from the irrigated plots (30 mm water on June 9 and 30 mm water on June 17) in the middle and at the end of June had a higher content of all the nutrients studied than those from the nonirrigated plots although at the latter date also the dry matter yield was markedly increased by irrigation. Later, the larger production of dry matter on the irrigated plots decreased this difference and resulted in equal or even somewhat lower contens of N, P, K, Mg, and Ca in the ears and straw, and also in the grains. An improvement in the supply of available nitrogen tended to increase the dry matter yield and the content of K, Mg, and Ca in the vegetative parts of the plant; the N content was increased also in the ears and grains. The positive interaction of water and nitrogen supply was distinct in the production of dry matter and in the uptake of nutrients. The high grain yields produced by irrigation and good or very good nitrogen supply were attributed, at least partly, to the more intensive uptake of nutrients during the period of vigorous growth in June. It was emphasized that the improvement of the efficiency of plant production by irrigation and placement of fertilizers may result in an impoverishment of the soil of other nutrients.",

The program assumes a single trait SNP-BLUP model where the breeding value can include a residual polygenic (RPG) effect. The reliability calculation requires elements of the inverse of the mixed model equations (MME). The calculation has three steps: 1) MME calculation, 2) MME coefficient matrix inversion, and 3) reliability computation. When needed, the inverted matrix can be saved after step 2. Step 3 can be used separately to new genotypes which do not contribute information to Step 2. When an RPG effect is included, an approximate method based on Monte Carlo sampling is applied. This reduces the MME matrix size and allows including many genotyped individuals. The program is written in Fortran 90/95, and uses LAPACK subroutines which enable multi-threaded parallel computing. The program is efficient in terms of computing time and memory requirements, and can be used to analyze even large genomic data. Thus, the program can be used in calculating model reliabilities for large national genomic evaluations.",

The inoculant affected lucerne silage characteristics but had little effect on the maize silages. In vitro fermentation of the silages showed few effects except increased microbial biomass yield (MBY) at 24 h in the inoculant-treated lucerne silages. In vitro fermentation of the lucerne silage water extracts produced no differences due to treatment except for reduced MBY in the inoculant-treated extracts.

Agricultural development trends both in terms of number of jobs and value of production, have been different from total economic development since the mid-1980s. As with economic functions in general, a regional concentration trend has taken place in agriculture. However, this trend has been stronger in all industries together and compared to other industries, agriculture as a whole is still regionally evenly dispersed. The reasons behind this can be found in historical, societal and political factors, and tight connections between agriculture and surrounding land and natural circumstances.",

The randomized complete block design was applied in field conditions in 2015–2017. It comprised one factor, the timing and the intensity of post-emergence weed harrowing with the spring-tine harrow. The plots were harrowed once, twice, or three times on one day at six consecutive growth stages of triticale: BBCH 10, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22. Harrowing did not increase the grain yield of the triticale-lupin mixture, and when repeated three times at BBCH 21, it decreased the grain yield. The cereal was more resistant than lupin to timing and intensity of harrowing. The weeds were best controlled by a single cultivation conducted at the first leaf of triticale. This method caused a significant reduction in the density and the biomass of weeds at the anthesis of triticale and a reduction in the weed biomass at the full maturity of the mixture.

    "abstract": "Dry cow therapy (DCT) is an efficient measure to control intramammary infections (IMI) in dairy herds. In a blanket-DCT practice (BDCT), all cows receive antibiotics at dry-off. In a selective-DCT practice (SDCT), treatments are targeted only at infected cows. Our objective was to compare the economy of SDCT and BDCT under Finnish production conditions. Economic analysis is needed to show numerically whether the farms currently applying BDCT can switch to SDCT without the dairy farmer’s economic losses. We applied a partial budgeting approach and built a stochastic calculation model to show the margin for costs that are equal in both DCT policies. Data for modeling were generated by running 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The parameters for the model were extracted from the literature and from official statistics. SDCT is a competitive management practice, especially with herds succeeding in keeping their IMI risk low. Therefore, the focus in farm-level decision-making should be on the herd’s udder health status. In those herds with high IMI prevalence, the problem must be tackled primarily by means other than BDCT, which does not support the goal of reducing the use of antibiotics and which, when used routinely, is also contrary to existing EU legislation.",

Tiineysajan pituuden keskiarvo ilman kaksosvasikkatapauksia oli 279.92 ± 0.222 vuorokautta, hajonta 4.30 vuorokautta ja muuntelukerroin 1.54 %. Tiineysajan pituus vaihteli 265—293 vuorokauteen. 2.

    "abstract": "In Finland the protein content of the feeds is in general so low that it restricts the milk yield particularly in herds of high production capacity. This is especially significant for the reason that owing primarily to climatic factors the quality of the feeds cannot be notably improved in this respect. Therefore an effort should be made to change the composition of milk by means of breeding in such a way that it would correspond to the possibilities of feed cultivation in Finland better than at present. This would mean that it should be endeavoured to breed cows whose milk is very fat-rich but at the same time poor in protein, in which case more of the commercially valuable butterfat could be produced on the feed grown on the estate. Since a correspondingly greater amount of milk of poor protein percentage could be produced than that of protein rich milk, the breeding of such cows would not decrease the yield of protein, which is of such great food value, but as great an amount in kilograms of milk protein would be available as earlier for domestic purposes as well as dairies. We have aimed at this goal in our country in general by endeavouring to raise the fat percentage of the milk by means of breeding. It is known that protein percentage does not increase exactly as markedly as the fat percentage, wherefore the protein yield per kilogram of fat decreases as the percentage rises. The influence of breeding would however be incomparably greater if low protein percentage were selected simultaneously with high fat percentage. In the investigation we have dealt with the possibilities of such selection in Finnish cattle, in connection with which we have striven to make clear how much the protein percentage of the milk varies independently of the fat percentage. The material comprises 54 West-Finnish Native cows; the fat and protein percentages of their milk yield has been determined once a month during one lactation. The relation of fat and protein is not the same throughout the whole lactation, but it changes so that at the end of the lactation the protein percentage as compared with the fat percentage is relatively greater than at the beginning of the period (Table and Figure 1). The averages of the fat and protein percentages and likewise the correlation between them depend consequently upon the length of the calving interval. Therefore the said averages have been estimated only on the basis of 2—7 production months. Fy means of these averages r = +0.60 ± 0.09 was derived as the coefficient of correlation between the fat and protein percentages y = 1.53 + 0.39 x as the regression equation, x = fat percentage and y = protein percentage. The individual cows diverge very much from the general rule set by the regression equation, which can be concluded already from the comparatively low value of the coefficient of correlation. The protein percentage of the milk yield of the West- Finnish Native cows diverges at least about one per cent independently of the fat percentage when judging on the basis of the extreme divergencies in the material. Although a part of the divergency evidently is caused by external factors, the role of the genetic factors is nevertheless so great that there appear to be great possibilities for breeding cows producing fat-rich milk by means of breeding but having a protein which would be considerably lower than the present average.",

For test material samples were selected to represent as far as possible the types of soil in which 1 the total phosphorus consists to a great extent of organic phosphorus and to a smallest possible extent of ferric and aluminium phosphates (heavy clay 5) and 2. the total phosphorus consists to a great extent of ferric and aluminium phosphates and to a small extent of organic phosphorus (muddy clay 4). Besides, in some samples phosphorus is present both in organic form and as ferric and aluminium phosphates (muddy clay 3), and the content of both being low (heavy clay 6). In addition, samples have been obtained from many years’ fertilizer experiment fields. Soil samples have been preserved limed and moistened in different ways for 9 months (Table 1) and for 6 months (Table 2). After incubation lime the organic phosphorus of samples was determined by treating with 0.25 N NaOH and easily soluble phosphorus with lactate method (Table 1). The samples preserved for a shorter period were analyzed according to Neubauer test whereby 3 successive harvests were made (Table 2). Due to liming organic phosphorus was decreased and the lactate-soluble phosphorus increased in samples containing amply organic phoshorus (Table 1). The Neubauer test gave similar results as the lactate method (Table 2). It can be concluded from the data that the increase of lactate-soluble and root-soluble phosphorus caused by liming is to a large extent ascribable to mobilization of organic phosphorus since it is greatest in soils where the percentage of organic phosphorus is highest. A part of the increase of easily soluble phosphorus is due to hydrolyzation of ferric and aluminium phosphates, since also in samples, containing little organic phosphorus but plenty of ferric and aluminium phosphates (muddy clay 4), increase of easily soluble phosphorus has occurred. In soil containing very little phosphorus both in organic form and as ferric and aluminium phosphates no increase of easily soluble phosphorus has been noted, on the contrary, a distinct reduction has been observed. Fertilizing has no effect on the percentage of organic phosphorus (Table 1). It seems that the amount of organic phosphorus depends more on the type of soil than on fertilizing.",

There is strong public support for maintaining the viability of domestic agriculture through government intervention, but views differ on allocation of agricultural support and how agricultural production should be developed. A significant number of respondents supported the idea that climate and other environmental issues should be better considered in agricultural policy. However, about half of the respondents accepted environmental damage caused by agriculture and one-fifth perceived the importance of agriculture in a society as declining. These views, not prominent in the public debate, emphasize the importance of regular investigation of citizen opinions for including all the relevant stands in policy discussion to design legitimate policy measures.",

In a field experiment on Aquic Haplocryoll soil, root intensities (number of roots/area) were measured to 50 cm depth by minirhizotron microvideo camera technology over a two -year period (21 recording sessions). At anthesis, root biomass and morphological parameters were measured by destructive soil sampling and image analysis of washed roots. Winter cereal roots reached 50 cm depth as soon as the autumn of the seeding year. For both post-seeding years, timothy roots developed the most intensively in spring, while red clover had higher root intensity than timothy in late autumn. At anthesis, the crops were ranked timothy &gt; red clover &gt; winter wheat &gt; winter rye according to root length density, surface area density, and biomass. Based on S:R ratios, red clover appears to offer the most intense carbon sink at 0–60 cm soil depth. Over-wintering crops had living roots in the subsoil both in late autumn and early spring, indicating potential to plant available nutrient uptake outside the growing season of annual crops.",

In Experiment 1, arctic bramble cvs. ‘Alli’ and ‘Mesma’ were grown in a greenhouse in 40, 60 or 80% RH and pollinated by bumblebees. In Experiments 2 and 3, commercial biostimulant products Kelpak, Cremalga, Kriss and Alginamin were tested on cv. ‘Alli’ in a greenhouse, and an open high tunnel. Fruit set and yield were strongly affected by RH, being highest in either 40% RH for cv. ‘Mesma’ or 60% RH for cv. ‘Alli’, reduced by nearly 50% in 80% RH. Kriss and Alginamin increased fruit weight by as much as 18% but there was no effect on total yield. We conclude that control of relative humidity in greenhouse cultivation, especially to avoid very high RH conditions, can be highly beneficial for arctic bramble, and that algae-based biostimulants show potential to improve fruit weight.",

Since economic viability and profit motives are strong among farmers, there is a need for analysis tools investigating the profitability of agronomically feasible, diversified cropping systems and rotations. While there is consensus on pre-crop effects, their impact is unclear and often overlooked in decision-making. We integrate recent empirically estimated pre-crop values into farm models to assess their influence on land use and farm economy and use dynamic optimization to solve the economically optimal crop rotations. The results show that including empirically estimated pre-crop values improves on subjective expert estimates of pre-crop effects and can eliminate the need for additional rotational constraints. Utilizing pre-crop effects consistently over time may lead to significant economic gains. This approach can contribute to sustainable agriculture by encouraging diversification and resilience, even amidst changing climates or novel crops.",

    "abstract": "The concentrations of zinc, copper, lead, cadmium and nickel in spring wheat grain and straw, Italian rye grass and lettuce were studied in a two-year field experiment conducted alongside two roads with a daily traffic density of 9500 and 5500 vehicles each. The experimental plots were located 22, 58 and 200 m from the roads. As controls, polyethylene pots filled with non-contaminated soil were placed in each plot. The values for the bulk deposition of lead were 50% and those for dry deposition over 50% higher in the plot 22 m from the roadside than in the plot 200 m from the roadside. The bulk deposition of zinc also decreased slightly with distance from the road. Cadmium depositions were low at all experimental sites. The highest values for dry deposition of lead and cadmium were recorded when the wind blew from the road in the direction of the collectors. The heavy metal concentrations varied from plant to plant but for a particular species were similar at different experimental sites. The highest zinc, cadmium and nickel concentrations were measured in lettuce. The lead concentration of wheat straw, Italian rye grass and lettuce at 22 m from the roadside was 1.5-3 times that of the background level at 200 m. In wheat grain, the lead concentration was very low and did not change with distance from the road. The plants took up lead mainly from air deposition. The zinc concentration of wheat grain and the nickel concentration of Italian rye grass were also high. Cadmium concentrations were low in wheat grain and straw and in rye grass. In wheat, the zinc and copper concentrations were higher and the lead and cadmium concentrations much lower in grain than in straw.",

Apart from some insignificant quantities, goat’s rue did not contain any known phytoestrogens. Even in biological studies it had no estrogenic effect. The estrogenic effect of alfalfa was apparently due to coumestrol, which was discovered in the samples in quantities of 34-65 ppm. All white clover varieties contained very small quantities of estrogenic isoflavones and coumestrol, and they did not explain the increased weight of the immature rat uterus observed in the biological studies.",

The purpose was to study the effects of the supplementation of concentrate to grass silage on rumen fermentation, microbial protein synthesis and digestion of organic matter (OM), fibre components and N. The diets were composed of grass silage alone (S); grass silage and barley (SBU, 50:50 % on dry matter (DM) basis); and grass silage, barley and protein concentrate based either on rapeseed meal (SBR), or meat and bone meal (SBM) (50:40:10). To make the diets isonitrogenous, 23 g of urea was given with the SBU diet. The supplementation of concentrates, irrespective of their type, increased the average rumen ammonia-N and total concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and decreased the molar proportion of acetate. Inclusion of concentrates in the diet had a negative effect on the digestibility of cell wall constituents. The production of microbial protein and the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis were not affected by the diet. It appears, therefore, that the supply of nitrogenous constituents for rumen microbes through ruminally degraded protein was adequate in silage feeding, and that no extra benefit, at the utilized level of application, was gained by the supplementation of any of the concentrates.",

Seeding rates were 300,500 and 700 viable seeds m-2. Chlormequat chloride (CCC)was sprayed at the two-node stage of the main shoot and its effects on lodging and yield formation were studied. Various traits were assessed that characterised tiller and main shoot growth and productivity, growth duration and plant stand structure.Spring rye responded differently over years and among CCC treatments. CCC increased grain yield by about 200 kg ha -1 compared with the control.Spring rye has long straw (130-140 cm)and tended to lodge under heavy rainfall.Thus,grain yield was maximum (ca. 5200 kg ha -1 in 1997)when rainfall was minimum.Partly because high seeding rates enhanced lodging,no seeding rate effects on grain yield were recorded.At 300 seeds m-2, yield formation of both main shoot and tillers was enhanced to compensate for the reduced number of main shoots m-2. Ripening was not delayed at low seeding rates.Grain and hectolitre weights were not affected by seeding rate. Thus,spring rye is a potential crop for Finland if low seeding rates are used.;",

For determination of soil type (according to clay content) and organic carbon content on average 8 samples, and for the plant available P (Bray 1) and exchangeable Mg and K contents 10 to 16 samples per hectare appear sufficient.

    "abstract": "Increasing concentrations of arsenic and heavy metals in agricultural soils are becoming a growing problem in industrialized countries. These harmful elements represent the basis of a range of problems in the food chain, and are a potential hazard for animal and human health. It is therefore important to gauge their absolute and relative concentrations in soils that are used for crop production. In this study the arsenic and heavy metal concentrations in 274 mineral soil samples and 38 organogenic soil samples taken from South Savo province in 2000 were determined using the aqua regia extraction technique. The soil samples were collected from 23 farms.The elements analyzed were arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc. The median concentrations in the mineral soils were:As 2.90 mg kg 1, Cd 0.084 mg kg 1, Cr 17.0 mg kg 1, Cu 13.0 mg kg 1, Hg 0.060 mg kg 1, Ni 5.4 mg kg 1, Pb 7.7 mg kg 1, Zn 36.5 mg kg 1. The corresponding values in the organogenic soils were:As 2.80 mg kg 1, Cd 0.265 mg kg 1, Cr 15.0 mg kg 1, Cu 29.0 mg kg 1, Hg 0.200 mg kg 1, Ni 5.9 mg kg 1, Pb 11.0 mg kg 1, Zn 25.5 mg kg 1. The results indicated that cadmium and mercury concentrations in the mineral and organogenic soils differed. Some of the arsenic, cadmium and mercury concentrations exceeded the normative values but did not exceed limit values. Most of the agricultural fields in South Savo province contained only small amounts of arsenic and heavy metals and could be classified as Clean Soil. A draft for the target values of arsenic and heavy metal concentrations in Clean Soil is presented.;",

    "abstract": "Storability of onion is affected by timing of harvest. However, the optimal time for maximum yield and maximum storability do not necessarily coincide. This study aimed to determine the most suitable harvest time for obtaining a high bulb yield with high quality and storability. Storage experiments were conducted on onions produced in field experiments at a research field and on farms in four years. Results indicate that harvesting could be delayed to 100% maturity, or even longer, without a marked increase in storage loss. In rainy years, late harvest is likely to impair the quality. The incidence of sprouting in shelf life tests varied considerably between years. An early harvest before 50% maturity and a delayed harvest increased the risk of sprouting. It may be concluded that the harvesting of onions for long-term storage can be timed to take place between 50% maturity and even some weeks after complete maturity without a loss in storage quality. Therefore, it is possible to combine high yield and good storage quality.",

The purpose of this work was to develop a small-scale dryer for herbs and vegetables. A prototype rotary dryer combining infrared radiation with a so-called heat pump drying method was applied in drying experiments for several herbs and vegetables. The drying experiments were performed under actual crop production conditions. The drying curves for leaves of birch (Betula spp.), rosebay willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium) and dandelion (Taraxacum spp.) as well as slices of red beet (Beta vulgaris) and carrot (Daucus carota) are presented. During the drying operation, temperature and humidity of the drying air were recorded, as well as the energy consumed in drying. The quality parameters measured were water content, colour and rehydration ratio. In the present rotary dryer design, intermittent irradiation and mixing of the product enable to avoid overheating, which is particularly important for maintaining product quality. In this dryer design the drying drum slowly rotates and simultaneously mixes the product. The infrared heaters are attached to a panel, allowing the product to receive infrared radiation periodically.",

    "abstract": "A severe infestation of the gall midge Epicalamus phalaridis (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae)occurred in a field of reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinacea in northern Sweden. The midge species has potential to become a serious pest on Phalaris grown for bioenergy or fibre production. Larvae of the midge feed beneath leaf sheaths and the crop lodges in late summer. Details are given on the biology of the midge. In the infested field, population densities of the midge were very high during three consecutive years. The crop was weakened and the occurrence of weeds increased. The dry matter yields declined markedly and were after three years of midge-attack about 50% of the average yield in the preceding years. The yield dropped comparatively more when the crop was harvested in the spring as opposed to harvest in late autumn and more at a nitrogen fertilisation at 100 kg compared to 200 kg N ha1 per year. The effect of midge attack on fibre quality was studied. The fibre properties of midge-infested parts of internodes were poor, but as midge-damaged parts are brittle, they could probably be sorted out in a fractionation process. Undamaged parts of infested internodes had the same fibre properties as those from an uninfested crop.;",

The five most abundant species accounted for 42% of the total catch, and the thirty most abundant species made up 98% of the total catch. Percentage similarities among the assemblages by PS-index were from 16% to 48%. In comparison to published data about carabid diversity in boreal forests, which form the dominating habitat matrix in which Finnish farmland is embedded as relatively small patches, arable fields harbor more species rich assemblages, with more even rank-abundance distributions but variable species composition. Importance of landscape (regional) level, instead of spatial level of crop fields, in understanding carabid diversity in farmland is discussed. Inclusion of carabids into monitoring schemes of agro-biodiversity at landscape level is suggested.",

Landraces originated from a collection of Polish Gene Bank, IHAR Radzików, Poland. Thirteen landraces (65%) expressed resistance reactions and from those 37 single-plant lines were selected. These lines were tested at the seedling stage with 23 differential isolates of powdery mildew. The isolates were chosen according to their virulence spectra as observed on the 'Pallas' isoline differential set and on 8 additional differential cultivars. Fiveteen lines originating from five landraces (4917, 4919, 4926, 4928 and 4935) expressed resistance to all isolates used. In 31 tested lines it was impossible to determine which specific allele or alleles for resistance are present. However, expression of infection types 0, 1 and 2 for the isolates tested indicated that 26 from these lines may have several alleles for resistance. Three different resistance alleles (Mlat and Mla6+ Mla14) were postulated to be present in the lines either alone or in combination with other unidentified genes. Allele Mlat was postulated to be present in 4 and alleles Mla6 + Mla14 were postulated to be present in 2 of the tested lines. The value of landraces for diversification of powdery mildew resistance genes available to barley breeders was discussed.;",

    "abstract": "The study estimates a conditional mean and conditional variance model for producer prices of fresh potatoes. The results suggest that potato price movements are volatile exhibiting a symmetric and non-stationary process. Prices respond symmetrically to exogenous shocks and the shocks are, thereafter, predicted to prevail in prices to the end of the marketing year. The persistency of the price shocks makes potato price movements unpredictable and, therefore, increases price risks of holding potato inventories. The estimates indicate elastic price response with respect to annual potato yield shocks. A ten percent yield increase is predicted to decrease prices by 20%. The information on inventory levels is included in prices and this information is not increased by surveying the inventory levels. Because of the elastic price response, the largest risk for a farmer is an exceptionally large total yield of potatoes. Information on the aggregate potato yield, which arrives during the growing season, will be quickly incorporated in prices. Therefore, pre-harvest hedging strategies are more efficient than after-harvest hedging strategies in managing potato price risks.",

The cation concentration in the leachate seemed to be determined by the CEO of the soil sample. The relative and absolute leaching losses were lowest in the sandy clay and highest in the sand soil. Five percolations extracted most abundantly calcium and least abundantly sodium, the losses of magnesium and potassium were of about the same magnitude. In regard to cation reserves of the soils the relative amounts leached usually followed the sequence: Na &gt;Mg≈ Ca&gt;K. Fertilization seemed to promote the leaching of cations, especially that of soil calcium. Water extracted 10 to 37 % of added magnesium, but only 2 to 6 % of added potassium due to the effective retention.

    "abstract": "The rumen microbiota were studied in free-ranging semi-domestic reindeer in Finnish Lapland under the nutritional conditions obtaining at two different sampling times. Qualitative and quantitative investigations were made of the rumen ciliate fauna and quantitative investigations of the rumen bacterial flora. The volume coefficients for rumen ciliates obtained by Westerling (1970) and that for rumen bacteria obtained by Warner (1962) were used to obtain an indication of the volume of the rumen microbe mass in reindeer. The rumen samples were collected in connection with the round-up and slaughter of reindeer, being taken from 30 animals in December and 29 animals in March. The reindeer slaughtered in December had normal access to food, but those slaughtered in March had grazed on better pastures and received a supplementary feed of hay. The total number of ciliate cells was over six times as high in March as in December, the numbers being 1 182900 and 188 300 per ml rumen contents, respectively. The corresponding total numbers of bacterial cells were 9.65 x 109 in March and 6.65 x 109 in December. The reason for the statistically significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher numbers in March than in December is probably the better nutritional conditions of the herd slaughtered in March, not the time of the year. The ciliate fauna consisted of 19 different species, although not all the species were found in every sample. The percentage composition of the ciliate fauna did not vary considerably between the two sampling times. The volume of the total microbe mass constituted 8.2% of the rumen contents in March and 1.9 % in December, the average being 5.1 %. The proportion of the ciliate volume in the total microbe mass was clearly higher than that of the bacteria at both sampling times: 7.2 times as high in March and 1.7 times in December, the average being 4.7 times.",

In this study the basic physical properties, the friction coefficient, heat flux as a function of time and softness of the bedding materials were measured. The heat flux to the bedding was shown to be large enough to affect the cows heat balance. The friction coefficients of most of the tested materials were not within the recommended 0.30.5. However, the friction values are only indicative, as the material and the shape of the arti- ficial hoof were not identical to natural hooves. There were also differences of almost an order of magnitude in the softness (Youngs modulus) of the mats. Demands for softness vary according to the type of building and cows physical condition, for instance a cow with an injured leg needs softer bedding. The properties of mats and beds varied considerably and the various properties did not correlate with each other. More information is needed concerning these values to animal welfare and health in order to be able to make recommendations of different physical material characteristics in different climate and housing conditions.;",

The pedogenic processes in a Spodosol, 10,700 years-old, at Sotkamo that has been cultivated for about 50 years were studied by characterizing the morphology and analyzing the major chemical properties, texture and mineralogy. Before cultivation, organic acids produced by decomposition of organic matter from pine litter in O and A horizons had weathered primary minerals in A and E horizons releasing Al and Fe. Percolating waters moved the organo-metallic complexes from A and E horizons to Bhsm and Bs horizons where the complexes coated and bridged sand grains eventually forming cemented ortstein. Because of the high biotite content of the parent material, the index of accumulation of Fe and Al in the Bhsm horizon (Al + 0.5 Fe = 4.1%) was the highest reported in Spodosols of Finland. The data support the theory of downward movement of Al and Fe as organo-metallic complexes with formation of some ferrihydrite but little or no formation of imogolite type materials. Little, if any, podzolization has likely occurred since the initiation of cultivation because, after agricultural liming and consequent increase of pH in the Ap horizon, organic compounds are likely to chelate Ca and Mg rather than Al and Fe.;",

    "abstract": "Imidazolinonies (IMIs) are a group of herbicides inhibiting acetolactate synthase (ALS) activity. They control the growth of many broadleaved weeds and annual grass species. Herbicide resistance against imidazolinonies has been transferred in some crop species, for example in Brassica napus. IMI-resistant oilseed rape cultivars have been developed by a mutation in ALS. They have been on the market for a few years, especially in North America. To determine if imazamox, an imidazolinone herbicide, and IMI-resistant oilseed rape cultivars are suitable for cultivation in Finland, we conducted four herbicide trials in three locations. We found, that imazamox had no negative effect on yield or oil quality characters of IMI-resistant oilseed rape. Some transient chlorosis was observed immediately after the treatment, but it was not apparent after a few days. The effects of imazamox against the most troublesome weeds in oilseed field in Finland, Chenopodium album and Galium spurium, were very good. Imazamox had good or moderate effects on Stellaria media, whereas its effects on Viola arvensis, Lapsana communis and Fallopia convolvulus were insufficient. If the total weed number was high or the emergence of oilseed rape was slow, the application of imazamox increased the yield of oilseed rape compared to untreated control. Our results suggest that imazamox is a good alternative in controlling weeds for Finnish oilseed fields. Therefore, it would be beneficial to transfer the IMI-resistance into Finnish oilseed and turnip rape lines.;",

The occurrence of the most abundant weed species in oilseeds was surveyed in 429 fields. In the fields with moderate or high weed infestation, 16 harmful weed species were recorded by visual observation according to their biomass production. About 40 weed species were recorded, the most predominant being Chenopodium album, Galeopsis spp., Galium spurium, Sonchus arvensis and Tripleurospermum inodorum. Elymus repens was the only major grass weed. Chemical weed control of broad-leaved weeds had been practised in 53% of the fields, resulting in relatively good control. In addition, both selective graminicides and glyphosate were used to control E. repens. Mechanical weed control was not practised in any field. The crop yield level was about 300 kg ha-1 higher in the fields with low weed infestation compared with in the highly infested fields. New promising options to replace the banned herbicide trifluralin are available. Thus, the most harmful weeds, such as C. album, which interferes with the production of high-quality oil for human consumption, can still be effectively controlled.;",

    "abstract": "One of the aims in domestic pig breeding has been to increase the size of litters resulting in variation in birth weight of piglets. Pig breeding has also resulted in increased body muscle mass. Muscles with the same size can consist either of large number of thin muscle fibres or small number of thick muscle fibres. Larger body muscle content means that in living animal the heart must pump blood to larger muscle mass than earlier. Our interest in this study was to investigate the relationship between the pigs birth weight and (i) growth performance and carcass composition, (ii) the size of organs, and (iii) the mean muscle fibre cross-sectional area at slaughter. The study consisted of twenty pigs slaughtered at the age of 165±2 days. The day after the slaughter, the carcass composition was determined by dissecting the chilled carcass into lean, fat, bones, and skin and organs were weighed. The average cross sectional area of muscle fibres was determined from three fast-twitch muscles longissimus dorsi, semimembranosus, gluteus superficialis, and two slow-twitch muscles infraspinatus and masseter. The birth weight of pigs ranged from 0.9 to 2.2 kg. We found no clear relationships between the birth weight and the pigs growth performance from birth to slaughter. When the birth weight increased the heart weight at slaughter increased as well (P &lt; 0.01). The heart weight was higher in those pigs with high carcass weight (P &lt; 0.05) and with the high weight of total muscle mass in the carcass (P &lt; 0.001). The cross sectional area of muscle fibres in M. longissimus dorsi (P &lt; 0.05), M. semimembranosus (P &lt; 0.10), and M. gluteus superficialis (P &lt; 0.05) was larger in those pigs with low birth weight compared to those found in pigs with high birth weight.;",

The data consisted of 5 309 lambs from ordinary production flocks, the Finnsheep nucleus flock and a breeding flock. The variance component estimation was done applying REML analyses. Wool traits included fleece uniformity, density, staple formation, lustre, crimp frequency, fineness grade and staple length. There was a smaller dataset that contained also lamb live weight, greasy fleece weight and additional fleece characteristics including fibre diameter measured with the OFDA method. The variance components for direct and maternal effects were estimated using bivariate analysis for 42-day, 120-day weight and greasy fleece weight. Heritability for visually assessed wool characteristics varied from 0.23 to 0.43 and for measured traits from 0.45 to 0.62. Staple length had a high negative genetic correlation with crimp frequency and fineness grade. Heritability of greasy fleece weight was high (0.55) and that of fibre diameter 0.62. The genetic correlation between crimp frequency and fibre diameter was negative (- 0.56). The results imply that the assessed traits are useful indicators for fleece quality and those of major importance can be introduced into the breeding programme. The results suggest that there is no antagonism in selection for both growth capacity and wool quantity.;",

The PVS2 vitrification protocol was successfully applied to two white poplar in vitro clones stored for more than 6 months in slow-growth conditions (4 °C, in darkness) and showing clear signs of explant etiolation and decay. After 60 min of PVS2 treatment, P. alba L. (cv. Villafranca) explants isolated from axillary buds demonstrated significantly better potential for post-freeze regrowth (64%) compared to those obtained from apical buds (17%). Similarly, a high level of survival (78%) of the frozen hybrid aspen shoot tips was recorded following the application of the same technique. Using the encapsulation-vitrification procedure, no toxic effects of the PVS2 treatment were noticed after 120 min exposure, however none of the cryopreserved (poplar and aspen) explants survived after 3 weeks. In contrast, the droplet-vitrification technique appeared to be very efficient in the cryopreservation of white poplar shoot tips, which increases the opportunities for wider application of this method in other woody species.;",

By utilizing a long-term field experiment on silt soil with 18 years of cropping history (19821999), including three OCSs and one CCS, we studied if this is true also for strawberry. The strawberry experiment was conducted in 20002002. The experiment had one CCS (A) and three OCSs (B,C,D). The impact of pre-planting peat amendment was also studied. The degree of overwintering, fruit yields, yield components and some soil nutrients were determined. Total and marketable fruit yields were estimated using a peduncle analysis based on weights of fruits of different orders in the peduncle, numbers of healthy and injured fruits in the peduncle and the number of peduncles per plant. The shoot growth, total and marketable fruit yields, as well as all yield components estimated were significantly higher in the OCS rotation D than in the CCS rotation A. The peat amendment, but not the cropping system, decreased the percentage of strawberry plants suffering from or killed by winter damage. However, peat amendment did not affect yield. The cropping system had no impact on soil pH, or the amount of extractable calcium, magnesium and nitrate. Extractable phosphorus and potassium were higher and soil organic carbon (Corg) slightly higher in the OCS than in the CCS. The peat amendment increased Corg by 2%. The amounts of extractable nutrients in soil were not a limiting factor for strawberry growth and yield as they were of sufficient levels both in CCS and OCS. It remains unclear whether the higher yield in the OCS was due to a long-term cropping history or to a short-term effect of composted manure, or to a combination of these two. The importance of soil organic management in strawberry production is emphasized.;",

    "abstract": "Meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) is grown widely in the Nordic countries in forage grass mixtures. Locally adapted cultivars are preferred for establishment of mixed swards. Meadow fescue seed yield is determined by seed weight, the number of panicle bearing tillers, size of panicles and the number of fertile florets. We aimed to determine the differences in components of seed yield in two different meadow fescue cultivars differing in forage quality; Kalevi, released in 1979, and Fure, released in 1999. Biomass accumulation was monitored, numbers of fertile and sterile florets, and seeds were counted, and the forage quality was analysed. Seed quality was also analysed. Fure was leafier and accumulated more vegetative biomass than Kalevi. Kalevi had significantly more panicles than Fure, although Fure compensated for the lower number of panicles with increased panicle size. There were no differences in number of sterile and aborted florets between cultivars. Based on the results it seems that these two meadow fescue cultivars have a completely different strategy in seed production even though the final seed yield was not markedly different. It is apparent that meadow fescues have good ability to compensate among the components of seed yield. Long-term field experiments should be conducted to investigate the interactions between plant stand ecology, seed production and cultivation technology.;",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with ash and mineral contents essential in the nutrition of livestock and man. The results of the investigated products are presented in Tables 1—3. Of the minerals the ash and the water-soluble part of it were determined, as well as the ash of the water-soluble fraction and the cations and anions P, Cl, K, Na, Ca and Mg. The determination of the water-solubility to some extent characterizes in what form the minerals occur in the plant. The following results were obtained in the determinations of the contents of total ash and the water-solubility. 1. As the Gramineae-grasses grow older the contents of ash and of individual minerals decrease, while the water-solubility simultaneously slightly declines (Table 1). The water-solubility of the ash and P is 70—80 %, that of K almost complete, that of Ca c. 50 % and that of Mg in general 60—70 %. 2. When red clover develops from the leaf stage to the blooming stage the contents of ash, N, P, Na, Ca and Mg decrease considerably, even to one half, while the content of K remains unchanged (Table 2). Simultaneously one can observe a decrease in the water-solubility. The water-solubility of the ash is 50—55 %, that of P 70—80 %, that of K almost complete, that of Ca 30—50 % and that of Mg 50—70 %. The contents of N, P and Ca in the leaves are considerably higher than in the stalks; at the blooming stage this is true also for Mg. On the other hand the content of K in the stalks is higher than in the leaves. The mineral content of the flowers is similar to that of the leaves, except that the content of ash is lower and that of phosphorus higher. 3. The water-solubility of the ash of cereal grains, cereal products and straws is 40—60 % (Table 2). The water-solubility of P in grains and wheat bran is c. 40 %, in brewers’ grains and straw 60—80 %. The water-solubility of K is only 60—80 %, except in straw where it is 90 %. The water-solubility of Ca in grains and brewers’ grains is c. 70 %, in the wheat bran and straw 30—40 %, in hulls of oats 20 % and awns of barley 66 %. The water-solubility of Mg in brewers’ grains is almost 70%, in oat grains and straw c. 50 %, in wheat grains and bran 20—30 %. 4. The water-solubility of the ash of roots and potato (Table 3) is high, 80—90 %. The ash content of tops and potato stalks is quite high, but the water-solubility of the ash only approximately 60 %. The water-solubility of P of the aforementioned plants and parts of plants is 70—90 % and that of K almost complete. The water-solubility of Ca in potato tubers, swede tops and spring rape is c. 50 %, where as it is low in other plants, especially in sugar beet tops and potato stalks. The water-solubility of Mg in potato tubers and tops is c. 70 %, whereas it is low in carrots, potato stalks and especially in swede roots. 5. In Table 3 are furthermore presented the mineral contents of some plants belonging to various groups of plants which to a limited extent may be used by some animals. The dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is quite similar to the meadow fescue at the leaf stage with respect to its mineral content and the water-solubility of various minerals. The common sedge (Carex Goodenowii) is with respect to its mineral content and the water-solubility of the minerals similar to the blooming timothy, except; that the amount and water-solubility of P is low. The water-soluble ash and the contents and water-solubility of various minerals of water horsetail (Equisetum fluviatile) and common horsetail (E. arvense) are approximately the same as those of the meadow fescue at the leaf stage, except that the contents of Ca and Mg are higher and the water-solubility of Ca considerably less. The ash content of chickweed (Stellaria media) (c. 24 % in the dry matter) and of its specific minerals, the content of K (c. 10 %) is exceptionally high. On the other hand lichen (Cladonia alpestris) is especially poor in minerals.",

Once the varieties with the highest susceptibility were severely infected by the fungi the test was suspended and the plants were given some 2 weeks to recover prior to being analysed. The tested varieties were well known from field trials during a number of years. The results agree in the main with those obtained in the field. The Finnish winter wheat and winter rye varieties showed a greater degree of resistance to the above fungi than the Swedish ones. The injury inflicted by F. nivale on winter rye was more severe than that on the winter wheat varieties. T. ishikariensis and T. incarnata were considerably more pathogenic to wheat than F. nivale, and the tested varieties showed varying degrees of resistance to these fungi.

    "abstract": "The nonexchangeable or fixed NH4-N was determined by the method of SCHACHTSCHABEL in 130 samples of Finnish mineral soils. In this relatively heterogeneous material consisting of 44 samples from the surface layer down to 20 cm and 86 samples from the deeper layers, the pH values ranged from 3.3 to 7.5, the contents of clay from 0 to 96 per cent, organic C from 0.03 to 6.6 per cent, and Kjeldahl-N from 0.13 to 4.53 mg/g. In the 46 finesand, loam and silt soil samples, the content of nonexchangeable NH4-N was, on the average, 90 ± 30 ppm ranging from 0 to 190 ppm. In the 84 clay soil samples it ranged from 40 to 620 ppm, with an average of 290 ± 30 ppm. The heavy clay soils of the deeper layers were particularly rich in fixed NH4-N containing it averagely 400 ± 40 ppm. Because of these soils the mean value in the samples of the deeper layers was as high as 260 ± 30 ppm and thus significantly higher than the corresponding figure in the surface soils, 140 ± 40 ppm. In the clay soils the amount of nonexchangeable ammonium was correlated with the clay fraction less than 0.6 μ (r = 0.74***), but not at all with the coarser clay. In the finesand, loam, and silt soils no correlation between the contents of fixed ammonium and clay was detected. No close relationship existed between the indigenous fixed ammonium and the capacity of the soil to fix applied ammonium. If the sum of these quantities would represent the total ammonium fixing capacity of the soil, about one half of this capacity would be saturated by the native fixed ammonium in the topsoil. In the subsoils the rate of saturation would be much lower. In the topsoil samples the amount of nonexchangeable NH4-N corresponded in the non-clay soils to 4 ± 2 per cent and in the clay soils to 9 ± 3 per cent of the Kjeldahl-N. In the subsoil samples the corresponding average percentage was 52 ± 5. The rather low ratios of organic C to Kjeldahl-N in the clay soils of the deeper layers may be taken to indicate that a part of the Kjeldahl-N was not in organic compounds. The C/N-ratios obtained when the amount of nonexchangeable NH4-N is subtracted from the Kjeldahl-N may be too high to characterize the soil organic matter, since it is likely that all the fixed NH4-N was not determined by the Kjeldahl-procedure.",

The acids are titrated electrometrically to pH 9.0. The cations are eluted from the resin and determined by flame photometry. As the inorganic salts present in the water extract are converted by the ion exchanger to the corresponding acids, the total acidity value is corrected for the chlorides, phosphates and nitrates present. The free and combined plant acids are calculated on the basis of the results obtained.

    "abstract": "The cereal often dominates the grain legume in intercrops, especially when sown in larger amounts. This study assessed yield formation of pea (Pisum sativum L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.) in an intercropping system in high-latitude conditions. Three pea cultivars (Hulda, Karita and Perttu) and one oat cultivar (Roope) were grown as sole crops and intercrops with shares of either 7.5% or 15% of oat (as weight of sown seed mixture). Experiments were organized in three (southern, western and northern) locations of Finland for three years. Yield and vegetative above-ground biomass, their land equivalent ratio (LER, i.e., the yield in intercrop compared to that of the component yields in pure stands), and a number of yield components were measured prior to harvest at crop-stand and single-plant levels. The share of oat in the intercrop did not have any impact on variation in LERyield. Oat yield and yield components generally benefitted from a pea companion crop. The pea cultivar Perttu was superior in intercrops: it had a LERyield&gt;1 in seven out of eight experiments (mean LERyield=1.06), while Karita had a LERyield&gt;1 in four (mean LERyield=1.00) and Hulda only in one experiment (mean LERyield=0.98). Perttu proved to be a compatible pea companion for a pea-oat intercrop, likely because it was successful in overcompensating for decline in relative yield (RGY) of oat in intercrops, contrary to Hulda. However, none of the measured yield components of Perttu were associated with LERyield, suggesting compensation ability between them, while in Karita and Hulda, e.g., higher grain yield and number of grains and pods per square meter were associated with decline in LERyield. It was concluded that the success of Perttu as a companion for oat in intercrops is likely attributable to its flexibility in building yield through a variable combination of yield components rather than being outperformed due to some superior traits. Such flexibility, likely attributable to long duration of flowering supports resilience to weather variability that is typical for northern European conditions allowing Perttu to consistently sustain a LERyield &gt;1.",

The choice experiment data were analyzed using a latent class model. The results demonstrate that the subjects were interested in the currently hypothetical, new types of investment instruments in agricultural producer cooperatives.

The possibility has also been pointed out that infection can take place by means of mycelia or spores which were present in the seed lot (3, 15, 16). The sclerotia have a durable outer covering consisting of 3—4 layers of cells which protects them from unfavourable external influences (9). Thus sclerotia are able to live for many years, although in general they are often rapidly destroyed in the soil. ERIKSSON (5) assumed that sclerotia in the soil remain viable during only one summer. At times sclerotia are completely destroyed within about two months (24), while often a large share of them survive in the soil for many years (3, 9, 19) and have been known to live for over seven years (16). The present investigation deals with the survival of sclerotia of Sclerotinia trifoliorum on the soil, their ability to infect clover, and the occurrence of clover rot at the Viik Experimental Farm of the University of Helsinki during the years 1954—1961. In addition, the appearance of apothecia in various years has also been studied.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a prototype model for evaluating measures to abate agricultural nutrients in the Baltic Sea from a Finnish national perspective. The stochastic simulation model integrates nutrient dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sea basins adjoining the Finnish coast, nutrient loads from land and other sources, benefits from nutrient abatement (in the form of recreation and other ecosystem services) and the costs of agricultural abatement activities. The aim of the study is to present the overall structure of the model and to demonstrate its potential using preliminary parameters. The model is made flexible for further improvements in all of its ecological and economic components. The results of a sensitivity analysis suggest that investments in reducing the nutrient load from arable land in Finland would become profitable only if the neighboring countries in the northern Baltic committed themselves to similar reductions. Environmental investments for improving water quality yield the highest returns for the Bothnian Bay and the Gulf of Finland, with smaller returns for the Bothnian Sea. Somewhat surprisingly, in the Bothnian Bay the abatement activities become profitable from the national viewpoint, because the riverine loads from Finland represent a high proportion of the total nutrient loads. In the Gulf of Finland, this proportion is low, but the size of the coastal population benefiting from improved water quality is high.;",

At the same time, there is a global attempt to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper analyses the medium-term (2015−2020) projections for milk production and associated GHG emissions from dairy cows in Estonia. The FAPRI-GOLD type market model of Estonian agriculture, which is used for projections of agricultural production, was supplemented with a module that helps project GHG emissions. The paper demonstrates the endogenisation of GHG emission factors in a relatively general agricultural market model context. The results imply that increasing milk production by 30% by 2020 would jeopardise Estonia’s commitments with regard to agricultural GHG emissions. However, the average GHG emission per tonne of produced milk will decline, thus reducing the “carbon footprint” of milk production.",

The results of the aggregate analyses proved to be practically independent of the initial moisture condition of the soil samples when the samples were wetted slowly with a spray. When wetting the samples by direct immersion the mean weight diameters of aggregates decrease with decreasing initial soil moisture content to values of less than half of those obtained from samples in their original field-moist condition (34.6—36.7 % dry wt.) or of those wetted with a spray. Air-drying seems to be a minor factor affecting the destruction of aggregates but the destruction effect of the sample pre-treatment may be very harmful if immersion wetting is used. This, however, can be eliminated almost completely if wetting with a fine mist is used.",

Eight samples from virgin peat lands representing different land qualities were used.

Some data from incubation experiments were compared with the uptake of peat nitrogen by plants. The results did not agree with the earlier conception that the Carex-peats are superior to the Sphagnum-peats, particularly in regard to the availability of peat nitrogen. Under the conditions of pot culture and incubation experiments some of the fairly poor Carex-Sphagnum peats were markedly better as supplyers of nitrogen to the plants than were e.g. samples of Bryales-Carex peat and eutrophic Sphagnum-Carex peat of the present study. The uptake of nitrogen by plants from the peat samples was often lower than the amounts of mineral nitrogen accumulated in short-time incubation experiments. The possible reasons for this discrepance was discussed. It was pointed out that in pot experiments these air-dried and ground peat proved to produce higher yields without phosphorus fertilizers than without application of nitrogen, at least in the first year.",

    "abstract": "60 peat samples from northern Finland representing different types of peat were incubated in a laboratory at a temperature of 17—18° C. The ammonium nitrogen, the nitrate nitrogen and the pH in the samples were determined after one month of incubation as well as after three months of incubation. The results were compared to results from determinations made before incubation. An attempt was made to elucidate the factors that influence the mobilization of nitrogen. On the basis of the above results it is evident that the differences between the various peat types as mobilizers of nitrogen are under these circumstances not very distinct, nor do these differences seem to be dependent on the types of peat. The following facts can, however, be established: In the amounts of ammonium nitrogen an increase takes place in most groups of samples during the first month. This increase is fairly big in the Sphagnum-dominated peats. The increase in ammonium nitrogen continues in the unlimed samples in most peat groups during all three months of incubation. After three months of incubation the amount of ammonium nitrogen in the limed samples is smaller than in the unlimed samples, although it is usually bigger than in the original samples. After the first month of incubation the amounts of nitrate nitrogen in all types of peat have decreased compared to the amounts in the original samples. In the limed samples the decrease is not as great as in the unlimed ones. After three months of incubation the amount of nitrate nitrogen has considerably increased as compared to the amount after one month of incubation. In the limed samples it might to some extent exceed the original amount of nitrate nitrogen, however, this is seldom the case in the unlimed samples. If the results are calculated on the basis of weight unit, it can be stated that the ability to mobilize nitrogen is greater in the Sphagnum peats than in the other peat groups. Working out the results in kg per ha it will be noted that somewhat more nitrogen is mobilized in the Carex-dominated than in the Sphagnum-dominated peats. The results obtained by experiments in the laboratory are not directly applicable to conditions in the field.",

The setup consisted of three 270m2 plots representing monocrops of faba bean and cabbage, and a plot of alternating strips of the two. The setup was established in 2018 and 2019. Activity density of P. xylostella was determined through yellow sticky trapping and Phyllotreta spp. activity density was determined by pitfall trapping. Crop yields were determined at harvest, and foliar damage to cabbage leaves was also assessed. The results showed that strip cropping reduced the activity density of P. xylostella, but no suppression effect was observed for Phyllotreta spp. Average foliar damage to cabbage was higher in the strip crop plot, but in 2018 the yield was also higher. Average faba bean yield was lower in the strip crop plot in both years. Our results indicate potential for cabbage-faba bean strip cropping to reduce the activity density of P. xylostella but not Phyllotreta spp. and to increase cabbage yield when overall pest pressure is moderate, but at the cost of faba bean yield. The case study shows that a Brassica vegetable – legume strip cropping system has potential for pest suppression in northern conditions, but agronomic compatibility of crop plants needs attention to ensure similar or higher productivity than a monocrop system.",

    "abstract": "A survey was conducted in southern and central Finland from 1982 to 1984 to determine the main weed species affecting spring cereal production. The weed flora was dominated by broad-leaved species. The most common broad-leaved weeds were Chenopodium album L., Galeopsis L. spp., Viola arvensis Murr. and Stellaria media (L.) Vili., and the most common grass weed was Elymus repens (L.) Gould. The density of weeds averaged 170 plants m-2 (median 124), and the dry weight 320 kg ha-1 (median 183). Ordination analyses revealed that the species composition of weed populations varied regionally and was affected by soil characteristics and crop management practices, particularly by long-term use of herbicides. An additional aspect studied in the survey was herbicide efficacy in farmers’ fields. Phenoxy acid herbicides, MCPA, dichlorprop and mecoprop, were the most common active ingredients used in the 252 spring cereal fields surveyed. MCPA alone gave only a moderate control of 65%, determined as a reduction of weed biomass, whereas the efficacy of herbicide mixtures containing MCPA averaged 83%. Inadequate control was in most cases due to a wrong choice of active ingredient for the prevailing weed population. Reduction in the use of herbicides by applying lower doses than recommended was studied in field experiments. Herbicide formulations of MCPA/dichlorprop, MCPA/mecoprop and MCPA/fluroxypyr were screened in spring barley (Hordeum vulgäre L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields. The efficacy of herbicides, applied at the lowest recommended dose, averaged 85%. At a 30% lower dose the efficacy still reached 79%. Even lower herbicide doses were often adequate, depending on the herbicide, weed species and the crop. The production of weed biomass was adequately suppressed with reduced doses since the most common and aggressive species, such as Chenopodium album and Galeopsis spp., were efficiently controlled with low doses. Use of reduced herbicide doses for three years in the same field caused neither an increase in the subsequent weed infestation nor changes in the species composition of weed populations compared with the treatments at recommended rates of application. The percentage emergence of weeds averaged 70-75% at the time of herbicide application when the crop was at the 3-4 leaf growth stage. However, spraying during the early growth stages of those weeds that emerge in the main flush is recommended since the competitive ability of the crop is normally sufficient to suppress the growth of late-emerging weed seedlings. At harvest the proportion of weed biomass in unsprayed plots, as a proportion of the total vegetative biomass, averaged 3.1% in barley fields and 3.6% in wheat fields. The growth of weeds was more efficiently suppressed with reduced herbicide doses than by increasing the seeding rate of the crop. The mean yield gain remained below 5% at all rates of herbicide application. No reliable density-based threshold for chemical weed control was established. Instead, site-specific dose adjustment based on the composition and infestation level of the prevailing weed populations is suggested to reduce the total use of herbicides and to maintain the current low levels of weed infestation. Consequently, annual reductions of 30% in use of cereal herbicides are expected. Such a reduction corresponds to monetary savings of approximately FIM 20 million per annum at the national level.",

Field bean was visited by Bombas subterraneus (L.)/B, hortorum (L.) as well as by B. lucorum (L.). These species were also present on goat’s rue; the most numerous bumblebee species on this plant, however, was B. lapidarius (L.) which was also the only bumblebee species visiting turnip rape. The total number of bees was highest on goat’s rue. The visits of honeybees began on field bean at noon and were most numerous in the afternoon. On goat’s rue, the numbers were smaller in the mornings, whereas turnip rape was visited at a rather constant rate throughout the day. On field bean, the numbers of B. subterraneus/B. hortorum increased and those of B. lucorum decreased towards the afternoon. On goat’s rue, these species were present in the morning and in the afternoon. B. lapidarius was present on goat’s rue during the whole day, but on turnip rape only in the mornings. On the basis of these results and earlier investigations it is concluded that the numbers of natural pollinators are rather low to assure adequate pollination in turnip rape and large field bean areas under the conditions in southern Finland. If the growing of goat’s rue becomes more prevalent, its pollination requirements need further studies.",

The effect of climatic factors on net blotch severity were also investigated. The genotype by site interaction for net blotch severity was not statistically significant, but that for yield was. Net blotch severity differed between years, but was similar across sites and there were statistically significant first order interactions between year, site and genotype. ‘Saana’ and ‘Thule’ had relatively low mean terminal net blotch scores and their reaction to the disease was less sensitive to the environment than was that of ‘Tyra’ for example. Analysis of yield data adjusted for net blotch severity indicated that the magnitude of the genotype by environment interaction terms were not accounted for to any significant degree by differences in relative net blotch resistances among the barley genotypes. Overall, mean scores for scald severity were lower than those for net blotch. Terminal net blotch severity was correlated with May rainfall and growing degree days.",

Plant viruses have been intensely studied in Finland over 40 years. Up to date, 44 plant virus species have been detected, and many tentatively identified viruses are also reported. Control of many virus diseases has been significantly improved. This has been achieved mainly through changes in cropping systems, production of healthy seed potatoes and healthy stocks of berry plants, fruit trees and ornamental plants in the institutes set up for such production, and improved hygiene. At the present, barley yellow dwarf luteovirus, potato Y potyvirus and potato mop-top furovirus are considred to be economically the most harmful plant viruses in Finland.",

The predicted longer growing season in Finland would imply that more productive cultivars and even new crop species could be grown. Moreover, higher [CO2] is also likely to increase dry matter production of crops. This study analyzed the growth of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) under ambient and suggested future conditions, and its response to N fertilization. Model simulations of soil temperature and of snow accumulation and melting were also studied. The calibration and validation results showed that the model performed well in simulating snow dynamics, soil temperature, the growth of barley, and the response of crop growth to N fertilization under present conditions. According to the simulation runs, if a cultivar was adapted to the length of the growing period, the increase in dry matter production was 23% in a low estimate scenario of climate change, and 56% in a high estimate scenario under a high level of nitrogen fertilization. The simulation study showed that the shoot dry weight increased by 43%, on average, under high N fertilization (150-200 kg N/ha), but by less (20%) under a low level of N (25-50 kg N/ha) when the conditions under a central scenario for the year 2050 were compared with the present ones.",

The plants were also compared with the aid of random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Apart from DNA, the most important distinctive characteristic was yield. Characteristics of the flowers, leaves and berries, such as number, size, shape and colour were used to differentiate between the arctic bramble genotypes. The yield of three new cultivars, named Marika, Muuruska and Elpee, was greater than that of Pima or Mespi. The yield of 'Marika' and 'Elpee' was 2,4-times and that of 'Muuruska' 1,9-times that of 'Pima' or 'Mespi'.

The responses of soil mineral N, dry-matter yield and uptake of N were also determined. Irrigation was performed during two periods in 1993 and one period in 1994. During sampling periods, the soil moisture ranged from 11% to 45% (v/v) and soil temperature from 0°C to 21°C. Unirrigated bare fallow contained 14-21% O2, 0.1-2% CO2 and 0.2-100 µl l-1 N2O (1993 maximum 27 µl l-1) in the soil air. Cropping and irrigation lowered O2 (minimum 3-7%) and raised CO2 (maximum 9%) in soil air, but fertilization had no effect. Irrigation raised N2O in the soil air if nitrate was present abundantly. Consequently, fertilization increased N2O especially in the irrigated bare soil, which still contained plenty of nitrate in autumn 1993. Cropping decreased N2O. The variation in soil air composition was partly explained by that in soil air-space. The average daily N2O-N emission amounted to 0-40 g ha-1 (mean 7 g ha-1) and correlated positively with N2O concentration in the soil air.;",

The difference between these two ley soils was not clear, partly because of the considerable statistical variance, but the microbial activity of organic cattle farm plots in clover leys tended to be higher than in conventionally cultivated grass leys. This favourable effect on dehydrogenase activity was not detected after poor overwintering in organic cattle farm plots in annual clover in 1984 and Persian clover in 1985, but some effect on nitrification was found in 1984. In many cases, soil microbial activity was still increased two to three years after the leys. The soil nitrification activities were often higher in organic plant production plots than in conventional plant production plots, but the dehydrogenase activities and cellulose decompositions of organic plant production plots were similar to those in conventional diverse plant production or barley monoculture plots.",

The effects of fertilization on concentrations of crude protein, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and non-structural carbohydrates, although statistically significant, were relatively minor in absolute terms. Na applications increased and K applications decreased sulphur and phosphorus concentrations, the magnitude of which was dependent on soil type. The increase in sulphur concentration can be attributed to sulphate in Na-fertilizer. The effects of fertilizers on in vitro organic matter digestibility and the potential extent of dry matter (DM) and NDF digestibility were small. Digestion kinetic parameters estimated from fermentative gas production measured using a fully automated system were used in a rumen simulation model to estimate digestibility. Total gas volume and the rate of gas production from the rapidly digestible fraction were negatively correlated with timothy S and N concentrations. Na application had no effect, but K application increased true rumen DM digestibility, the effect being most profound on organogenic soil. The results suggest that Na application does not elicit substantial positive effects on the nutritive value of timothy which has often been reported for perennial ryegrass, but K application can improve the nutritive value of timothy grown on K deficient soil.;",

The formation of gluten was less at dry conditions (total precipitation under 50 mm) and total precipitation exceeded 130—140 mm. The optimum daily temperature for gluten production was some 15—17°C during grain filling. The gluten content decreased if daily minimum and maximum temperatures exceeded 11—12°C and 21—22°C, respectively. The effect of temperature and rainfall were not, however, significant in early maturing varieties. The climatic factors and grain yield did not correlate. Grain yield and protein yield had strong positive relationship, which was perhaps a consequence of supply and utilization of nitrogen. It is concluded that climatic factors affecting yield to quality ration in wheat may be excessive rains before heading and high temperature during grain filling. Interaction between weather and nitrogen are discussed to optimize correct timing of nitrogen fertilization for amount and quality of economic wheat yield.",

    "abstract": "Discussed are the reproductive and productive characteristics of the dairy and prolific Chios sheep breed, originating from the homonymous Greek island. Besides the island, the breed is also raised in the Greek mainland, the westcoast of Turkey and in Cyprus. It is early maturing, with long reproductive reason and lambing period, extending from October to March. Inspite its high ovulation rate, repeatability estimates do not suggest the presence of fecundity genes. The average prolificacy ratio ranges between 1.80 and 2.0, with triplets and quadruplets not uncommon. The average exploitable milk yield varies between 180 and 200 kg, with occasionally reported productions of up to 400 and 500 kg. Repeatabilities of prolificacy and milk production based on island data were found 0.15 and 0.40, respectively. Heritability of milk yield from the island was 0.31 and 0.40, respectively, for second and third lactations. Recent estimates from Cyprus report values of 0.30 and 0.39 for 90-day milk and total milk yield, respectively. Other parameters and information on udder (mechanical milking), growth, and carcass characteristics as well as on crossbreeding trials are also reported. Some considerations are given with regard to potential and valorization of this highly productive sheep breed.",

    "abstract": "Finnish milk fat is relatively hard, particularly during the indoor feeding period. For reasons of both dairy technology and nutrition, however, it would be advantageous to obtain a softer fat. On the basis of the initial experiments, it would appear that the feed concentrates used, particularly their grain component, have a effect on the composition of milk fat. For this reasons, a comparative study of the effect of oats and barley on the fatty acid composition of milk fat was being carried out in the winter of 1983. In a comparison of barley and oats, it was observed that the iodine value of the milk in the experimental group which was fed barley was 5.1 units lower than that of the group fed oats. By itself, the feeding of barley alone was also responsible fora sharp decrease in iodine values when compared to the results obtained during the pre-experimental phase during which the cows were fed barley and oats in a ratio of 1:1.The softening effect of oats on milk fat appeared to be slight when the results from the experimental phase were compared to those of the pre-experimental phase. In a comparison of the fatty acid composition of milk fat in samples from the barley and oats groups, it was found that the greatest differences were in the amounts of palmitic acid (C16) and oleic acid (C18:1) present. The amount of palmitic acid in the milk fat of the barley group was 36.6 %, and in that of the oats group 30.2 %. The corresponding amounts of oleic acid were 14.7 % and 22.1 %. On the basis of this study, it is recommended that oats should be preferred in making up feed concentrate mixtures for milk cows.",

The gases were ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan and other sulfides. The mean concentrations of ammonia varied between 8—43 cm3/m3 in the air of livestock building. In the poultry yards the mean concentration of ammonia was highest; it was lower in piggeries and especially in cowhouses. Carbon dioxide concentrations were 500—3500 cm3/m3 in cowhouses, 1000—4000 cm3/m3 in hoghouses and 600—4000 cm3/m3 in poultry yards. Very low concentrations of methane and sulfur compounds were found in the livestock confinement buildings. It is obvious that in normal working situations only ammonia of the measured gases exceeds the threshold limit value (25 cm3/m3). High ammonia concentrations can be expected in the floor type poultry confinement buildings especially when manure is left on the floor for several months. In such cases effective mechanical ventilation is the only way to keep the ammonia level acceptable.",

    "abstract": "Over the period from 1972—1982 the incidence of blossom beetles and their effect on yield formation in rape were studied infield trials and cage experiments at the Agricultural Research Centre, Vantaa, near Helsinki. The beetles migrated to the winter rape stands in May, when maximum daily temperatures rose above + 15°C, and the migration to the spring rape stands occurred about three weeks later. The population peak in both winter and spring rapes occurred just before flowering. During the 1970’s the diminishing cultivation of winter turnip rape, the chief host of the blossom beetle, together with an increase in the extent of spring rapes resulted in the reduction of beetle populations to such low levels that intensive control measures were not required until 1981. It appears that the blossom beetles are gradually adapting themselves to the developmental rhytm of spring turnip rape. In the cage experiments beetles were maintained on the plants a) from the seedling stage to flowering, b) from flowering to maturity and c) from the seedling stage to maturity, starting with populations of 5, 15 or 25 beetles/plant. In the first treatment the beetles had no significant effect upon yields, as the plants were able to compensate for the injuries. In the other treatments even the lowest population density reduced yields. The larvae, too, contributed to the yield loss. Apparently a vigorous stand can tolerate large numbers of beetles up to a few days before flowering, provided they are promptly destroyed after that. In the field trials, yield losses caused by natural populations of beetles ranged from 0—34 %. Even lower incidences than 2 beetles/plant caused measurable losses in yield. The injured plants produced fewer siliquas than the control plants, but tended to compensate by increasing seed number and seed weight. The trial results confirm that the threshold level, 1 beetle/plant at the early bud stage, should be followed. On the other hand they clearly demonstrate that the threshold level is essentially dependent upon the growing conditions and time of injury. For fully effective control generally two applications of insecticide are needed. The best control strategy in the future will probably involve a comprehensive regional application eg. in two to three year sequences in order to prevent the beetle populations from building up to excessive levels.",

    "abstract": "The effect of increasing lime quantities on reactions of native and applied P was investigated in an incubation experiment performed with two acid mineral soils of pH 4.8 (CaCl2). The soil samples differed considerably in the content of organic matter, which was reflected in their pH buffering power: in the fine sand, rich in organic matter (6.4 % org. C), liming raised the pH less than in the muddy fine sand (3.0 % org. C). The level of native water-soluble P was markedly lowered in the incubated soil samples treated with nutrient salts. In the muddy fine sand, the decrease tended to be the smaller, whereas in the fine sand the greater, the more intensive liming was. This held true also of added P. The changes in CHANG and JACKSON’s P fractions did not alone satisfactorily explain the dissimilar response of soil P to lime treatments. The fate of P was concluded to be controlled by the quality and quantity of Al species differing in their affinity for P sorption. The changes in the solubility of P are a net result of processes enhancing and of those depressing the sorption tendency. In the fine sand soil of high initial content of water-soluble P, the detrimental effect of liming seemed to be attributed to the abundance of polymerized Al the affinity of which for P retention increased with intensified liming. Further, the high pH buffering power of this soil reduced the efficiency of lime to produce OH- ions able to compete with phosphate for sorption sites. In the muddy fine sand soil, on the contrary, the formation of sorption-active sites was not equally marked and, owing to the weaker pH buffering, liming raised the OH- concentration more effectively.",

Ultrastructure of interactions was studied using electron microscopic techniques. Following inoculation, conidia of S. nodorum germinate, form appressoria anda penetration peg which directly penetrates through the cell walls. It is suggested that most penetration attempts fail because of cellular defence reactions, formation of papillae and cell wall alterations. Inoculation with low spore concentration reduced grain yield of Hankkija’s Taava cultivar by 10 % and 1000-grain weight by 14 %. Inoculation with high spore concentration on large plots of Tähti cultivar reduced grain yield by 32 % and 1000-grain weight by 18 %. Inoculation with high spore concentration on normal breeding plots of Tähti cultivar reduced grain yield by 35 % and 1000-grain weight by 21 % and the grain yield of Kadett cultivar by 27 % and 1000-grain weight by 20 %. Inheritance studies on F2 progenies of spring wheat crosses involving susceptible and moderately or highly resistant parents suggest that heredity component of symptom expression is moderate level and breeding success depends mainly on efficient screening techniques. Resistance was associated with tallness in crosses, and cultivar trials suggest that resistance is positively associated with late maturation time. Field screening techniques based on small plots and artificial inoculation showed that the most resistant entries were wild Triticum species and late and tall cultivars. Seedling plant tests based on attached seedling leaves and detached leaves revealed easily the most resistant and most susceptible cultivars. The overall correlation between seedling tests and field tests was quite high. The results are discussed in relation to wheat breeding strategies for resistance to S. nodorum.",

In the ligand exchange the central ions Al3+ and Fe3+ of the oxides are Lewis acids or electron acceptors and the ligands are Lewis bases or electron donors. The binding of ligand oxygen by the central ion is primarily dependent on the nucleophilic strength of the ligand oxygen. The proton is a hard Lewis acid as are Al3+ and Fe3+. The pKa-value of the acid corresponding to the anion shows the ability of ligand oxygen to bind a proton and also the ability to bind Al3+ and Fe3+. The greater the nucleophilic strength of the ligand, the more covalent the nature of the bond between ligand oxygen and the central ion. However, the covalent character of this bond does not make the adsorption of a ligand by oxides an exothermic reaction. The entropy changes in adsorption determine the exchange equilibrium of the anions. The nucleophilic strength of ligand oxygen also determines the rate of exchange. If an anion has a high nucleophilic strength, it is rapidly adsorbed by oxides but the desorption is slow. The theory explains the relationship between the adsorption of anions to oxides and the pH-value in the equilibrum solution. The theory also illuminates the factors, which determine the leaching of an anion from the soil and the uptake rate of an anion from the soil by plants.",

The material consisted of 193 mineral soils and 17 organogenic soils. Oats (Avena saliva L.), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and turnip rape (Brassica campestris oleifera L.) were used as the test plants in the pot experiments. A cation exchange resin method was developed for extracting soil manganese. The method enabled both exchangeable and reducible manganese to be determined. Exchangeable manganese comprised the manganese which was freely present in the soil solution in cationic form, and the manganese in cationic form which could be exchanged from the soil. Reducible manganese was the manganese reducible to the oxidation state, Mn2+, by the action of hydroquinone, hydroxylammonium chloride or ascorbic acid. The content of exchangeable manganese in the soil explained 33,7 % of the variation in the manganese content of the first yield of ryegrass. The greater the number of yields harvested, the smaller was the significance of the content of exchangeable manganese in the soil as an independent variable. On the other hand, when the content of reducible manganese in the soil was used as the independent variable, then the greater the number of yields harvested, the better it explained the variation in the manganese content of the yield. The content of manganese reduced by hydroxylammonium chloride explained 68,6 % of the variation in the manganese content of the fourth yield. The contents of exchangeable manganese and manganese reducible by ascorbic acid explained 73,4 % of the variation in the manganese content of the roots. The pH, the organic carbon content and the content of hydroquinone-reducible manganese in the soil explained 67,0 % of the variation in the content of exchangeable manganese in the plough layer of the mineral soils. The content of \"total\" manganese in the plough layer of the mineral soils explained 27,6 % of the variation in the content of ascorbic acid-reducible manganese. The plant stands increased the content of exchangeable manganese in the soil and decreased the redox potential of the soil in comparison to the incubated soils. The content of exchangeable manganese started to increase when the redox potential of the soil fell below 0,59 V. Adding glucose promoted the reduction of manganese in the soil, reduction appearing to be both biological and non-biological in origin. Soil moisture increased the content of exchangeable manganese when the moisture was higher than the field capacity. Liming decreased the content of exchangeable manganese in the soil more than would have been expected on the basis of the change in pH values. The manganese content and manganese uptake of the crop were also reduced. Adding large amounts of manganese (Mn 51,5 kg/ha*20 cm) did not prevent liming (calcite 14 t/ha*20cm) from reducing the manganese content of the yield.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of freezing on some structural properties of clay soils. The laboratory analyses were based on field observations including measurements of soil temperature and frost depth. The daily temperatures showed remarkable variations on the very soil surface both in the autumn and spring, ranging from below zero at night-time to above 10°C at daytime. The depth of soil frost was deepest in the ploughed field, whilst the straw cowers on the soil surface not only strongly reduced its depth, but also slowed up the thawing. Eight clay soil samples were analyzed in the laboratory. At the potentials of —0.001 to —0.1 bar the water retention capability of soil was reduced by freezing. Disruption of the 5 —10 mm aggregates by freezing, analyzed with wet and dry sievings and waterdrop analysis was strongly dependent on the water potential, the Water potential of 1.0 bar or lower having in general no effect. The total pore volume of aggregates Was dependent on the water potential when it exceeded —15.0 bar. Freezing had a minor effect on the pore volume of the aggregates, if they were let to thaw before drying. The freeze-dried aggregates showed a clear increase of pore volume when the water potential at freezing exceeded —1.0 bar. The movement of water due to ice formation was studied with small and big soil cylinders. It showed a great effect on the structure, if total pore volume, determined with a mercury method, is considered the standard of judgement. Thus it was concluded that the water movement even at a short freezing period is one of the most essential factors determining the structural formation of ploughed clay soil.",

In four irrigation experiments, established in the clay area of South Finland, the irrigation performed in the middle of June (2 x 30 mm) increased the yield of two rowed barley by 1750 kg/ha on an average or by 71 % (variation range 49—104 %). In addition irrigation improved the quality of barley significantly by preventing detrimental late tillering. The irrigated evenly ripened barley was at harvesting time on an average 12.3 per cent units drier, with a hectolitre weight that was 3,6 kg higher when compared to the non-irrigated green grained barley. Analyses of the sheaves collected from the fields indicated that irrigated barley when compared to non-irrigated barley contained: a) equally many individuals per square meter, b) 14% less ears per individual, c) 83 % more grains per ear, d) 9 % heavier grains; in fact the total result was a 70 % higher grain yield. Causes of late tillering and the significance of irrigation in preventing this detrimental phenomenon are discussed. It is further established that in years when no late tillering occurs, irrigation affects the grain yield components in ways that differ from those established in the present study.",

The results were obtained from samples of barley (c. 860 samples) and rye (c. 200 samples) gathered in fields during the growing season throughout the country in 1971 1973. The samples (c. 170 samples) of Agropyron repens were collected in fields and the borders of fields. The fungi of all the samples were examined by microscope and cultures and inocolation tests were used as well. Rhynchosporium secalis was observed to occur commonly on spring barley throughout the country from Helsinki to Lapland. The fungus was observed in about 30 per cent of the fields and in below 60 percent of the localities examined. Leaf blotch was commoner on six rowed barley than on two-rowed barley. The fungus sometimes attacked a field in great profusion. R. secalis was observed in below 50 per cent of the winter rye samples and in below 70 per cent of the localities examined. The fungus occurred commonly in the southern part of Finland and was found also in Lapland (Inari, 69° N, 27°E). Spores of the fungus were most abundant in the leaves of rye in spring and in early summer. R. secalis was observed rather scarce (in over 10 per cent of fields and in over 25 per cent of the localities examined) on Agropyron repens throughout the country. A high degree of host specialisation has been found within the species R. secalis. Two isolates from spring barley and from winter rye were pathogenic to their original host only.",

The aim of the present study was to compare TMR representing simplified feeding (TMR1) with TMR combined with a decreasing amount of additional concentrate (TMR2C). Finnish Ayrshire cows (39) were housed in a loose housing barn. TMR1 consisted of a mixed ration of grass silage (0.49) and concentrates (0.51). In TMR2C, the same grass silage and concentrate were mixed in a ratio of 55:45. In TMR2C, cows were offered additional concentrates from automatic feeders differing in composition from the concentrate in TMR1 [6.5 kg d-1 (first 100 days, Phase 1), 3.0 kg d-1 (subsequent 50 days, Phase 2) and no concentrate thereafter (Phase 3)]. During the whole experiment (224 days), total consumption of concentrates per cow averaged 2426 kg dry matter (TMR1) and 2414 kg dry matter (TMR2C). There were no significant differences in mean total dry matter, metabolizable energy, crude protein or absorbed amino acid intakes. During Phase 2, total intake of all cows fed TMR2C was one kg lower (P = 0.10) than for cows fed TMR1. This was due to differences in total feed intake of multiparous cows. Average yields (kg d-1) of milk, energy corrected milk, protein, fat and lactose were not significantly different between diets. During Phase 2, primiparous cows tended to produce more energy corrected milk on TMR2C than on TMR1. The results showed that both TMR1 and TMR2C were equal feeding strategies for early lactating cows and cows did not benefit from greater concentrate consumption in early stage of lactation when total consumption of concentrates was similar.;",

The fields belonged to: autumn mouldboard ploughing (AP), conservation tillage (CT) and perennial grass in the crop rotation (PG). In the third year, direct drilled (DD) fields were established in five areas. Excluding PG, mainly spring cereals were grown in the fields. Location and surface area of ponded water (in the spring and autumn) as well as hampered crop growth (during June-July) were determined in each field by using GPS devices and GIS programs. Surface water ponding or crop hampering occurred when the amount of rainfall was clearly greater than the long-term average. The mean of the relative area of the ponded surface water, indicating the risk of surface runoff, and hampered crop growth was larger in the CT fields than in the AP fields. The differences between means were, however, not statistically significant. Complementary soil physical measurements are required to investigate the reasons for the repeated surface water ponding.;",

Only on a sandy loam with low P status did annual P applications give statistically significant yield increases, 7% and 20% over the P-unfertilised treatment for onion and cabbage, respectively. The maximum P rate allowed by national regulation for this soil is 80 kg ha-1, but P rates of 10–12 kg ha-1 were sufficient to produce 97% of the yield maxima. The results strongly suggest that the P demand of the studied vegetables is smaller than previously thought also in a boreal climate. Critical soil test P concentrations for vegetables should be established to avoid unnecessary build-up of soil P that may be uneconomical and elevate the risk for P losses to waterways. However, too few data exist for this at present.",

    "abstract": "Attention is paid in the present paper to the conflicting information in the literature about the recovery of fertilizer nitrogen by crops. One reason for this inconsistency is suggested to be the fact that in several cases the difference in the nitrogen content of the crops receiving all the main nutrients and that of the unfertilized crops is supposed to represent the amount of nitrogen taken up from the fertilizer. This has been done even when results of the same experiment distinctly show that an application of potassium or phosphorus fertilizers has markedly increased the amount of nitrogen in the crop as compared with the unfertilized one. In some Danish and Finnish longterm field experiments the uptake of fertilizer nitrogen by the crops of the whole rotation has been reported to be 60 to 104 per cent. When the apparent recovery of fertilizer nitrogen is computed on the basis of results from treatments which differ only in regard to the nitrogen application, values ranging from 11 to 55 per cent of the amount applied are obtained from these experiments. In two American longterm rotation experiments with grains the recovery of fertilizer nitrogen varies from 18 to 42 per cent. The present of root crops in the rotation appears to increase the recovery of fertilizer nitrogen. It seems that the residual effect of fertilizer nitrogen is worth some more consideration. Results of Finnish pasture experiments are in accordance with the statement by COOKE (3) that on the average two thirds to three quarters of the applied fertilizer nitrogen is taken up by grass. In field experiments carried out with oats by the present institute the apparent recovery of fertilizer nitrogen by grains and straw ranged from 24 to 76 per cent of nitrogen applied as calcium nitrate or ammonium nitrate limestone. In general, the recovery was related to the nitrogen conditions of the soils characterized by the contents of total nitrogen and mobilizeable nitrogen. The relative recovery did not seem to depend on the rate of application. No significant difference could be found between the uptake of nitrogen from the two fertilizers, although some tendency towards a slightly better utilization of calcium nitrate may exist. The variation in the uptake of fertilizer nitrogen is large, but obviously, the apparent recovery by arable crops, except by root crops, is usually more likely to be less than 50 per cent than to exceed 70 per cent. Therefore, studies on the improvement of the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizers seem to be necessary.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to find out if organic apple juice (AJ) contained higher contents of polyphenols or patulin compared to conventional AJ, and if higher storage temperature before processing increases patulin content in juice. AJ was pressed from Estonian, Danish and Norwegian apples. Additionally, three cultivars from Estonian organic and conventional orchards were stored at 3±2 °C and 9±2 °C before processing. Patulin, polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity were determined in pasteurized juices. In 2015, 33% of conventional (n=6) and 46% of organic (n=11) juices contained patulin; two of the organic juices above the legal limit (191 and 64µg l-1). In 2016, none of the AJs contained patulin. Patulin occurrence was more affected by weather conditions two weeks before harvest than by cultivation system and apple storage temperature. Polyphenol content was higher in organic than in conventional juices and was reduced at higher apple storage temperature.",

In split-plot design, fertilizer treatment with unfertilized control, organic fertilizer, and synthetic fertilizer was the main plot factor, and crop treatment with fallow, red clover (Trifolium pratense), timothy (Phleum pratense), and a mixture of red clover and timothy was the sub-plot factor. Dry matter, carbon and nitrogen yields in mixture plots were highest with relatively high N% and the optimum C:N ratio (p &lt; 0.05). Fertilization increased annual yields of mixture and timothy but not that of red clover. Soil NO3-N changed over time (p &lt; 0.05) and was highest in fallow, followed by red clover, mixture, and timothy (p &lt; 0.05), and the decrease during late growing season was smaller in the mixture and timothy plots. At the end of the experiment, soil C/NO3-N ratio was higher in timothy and mixture while lower in red clover and fallow plots (p &lt; 0.05), and the relationship between soil DNA and NO3-N content may indicate that the potential nitrogen loss was lower in mixture and timothy than that in fallow and red clover plots.",

Seven products with different composition of mineral nutrients were applied to the seed in a combination with binder, filler and fungicide (BFF), or applied directly onto the seed. The results showed that a treatment with mineral nutrients increased the plant size at stage BBCH 60 (early flowering stage) when the products were applied in combination with BFF in the field experiments. However, the increased plant size did not influence seed yield. Furthermore, when seeds were treated only with a nutrient product the addition of BFF decreased plant size by 10% on average and seed and crude fat yields by 4% on average. The use of BFF may thereby be questioned and is subject to further investigation.",

Data were collected by postal survey from farmers of the Salo region in South-Western Finland. Farmers were categorized into three different groups according to a combination of their age and experience. Farmers who were in the early phase of taking over a farm had better education and better networks than their older counterparts. Younger farmers considered their networks to be more important than did their senior colleagues. The early phase farmer group invested significantly more and had more liabilities than the other two groups. Moreover, early phase farmers were the most active at developing their farms. The late phase farmers were the least active, even when they knew they were going to transfer their farm to next generation within the next few years.

The mutual dependence of five variables, calcium (x1), sodium (x2), the total excess of cations (x3), chlorine (x4), and inorganic phosphorus in the blood (x5), was investigated simultaneously. For this purpose the coefficients of partial correlation were calculated and the dependence of each mineral studied was expressed as a linear function of the others. If the effects of all the minerals studied were taken into consideration simultaneously the inorganic anions in the blood showed a slight positive correlation with the blood calcium or vice versa, r14;235 = +0.1353 and r15;234= +0.1717. The phosphates appeared to be proportionately more effective than the chlorides. No reciprocal relationship was noticed between calcium and inorganic phosphorus in the blood of dairy cows Blood chlorine and inorganic phosphorus in the blood were reciprocally related, r45;123 = —0.1746; hence it is concluded that an excessive feeding of chlorides can remove phosphorus from the blood and affect the requirements. Blood sodium and chlorine were fairly closely correlated, r24;135 = +0.7022, and the possibilities of removing one oi these elements from the blood by feeding the other in excess appear to be limited. Regarding the positive effects asserted to be obtainable with chlorides in maintaining the blood calcium at high level the study has given a fairly positive result. If, however, the excess of cations in he blood is maintained simultaneously at a normal level the effect of chlorides on the blood calcium appears to be very slight and in practice some other methods may be preferable.",

The experimental period lasted for 224 days. The ad libitum fed roughages were grass silage, hay and oat straw, each supplemented with four levels of concentrates, the number of treatments thus being 12. Daily supplements of concentrates were 0,1, 2 or 3 kg on grass silage feeding, 1,2, 3 or 4 kg on hay feeding and 2,3, 4 or 5 kg on straw feeding. Barley was used as a concentrate on grass silage feeding, but part of it was replaced by rapeseed meal and urea in the hay and straw feeding groups to balance the nitrogen intake. An increase in concentrate intake was found to decrease the roughage intake with each type of roughage, but the total intake of dry matter (DM) was increased. Increasing the level of concentrates enhanced both the rate of daily live weight gain (LWG) and carcass gain. However, 2 kg more concentrates was needed on hay feeding than on grass silage feeding to obtain similar carcass gain. On straw feeding, 4 kg of concentrates was not sufficient to obtain a comparable carcass gain as with grass silage alone. The response to concentrate supplementation on grass silage feeding indicated, however, that the growth potential of the bulls receiving silage alone or silage with small amounts (1 or 2 kg/day) of concentrates was not completely utilized. The study showed that LWG is an inadequate measure of animal performance when diets with different fill characteristics are compared. With coarse diets, a relatively large proportion of LWG is rumen contents. Comparisons of animal performance and feed conversion should, instead, be done in terms of carcass gain.",

Late P. brachyurus inoculation did not influence growth of nonmycorrhizal plants while early pathogen application caused reductions in nonmycorrhizal plant growth. Nematode number per g of root was significantly decreased for endomycorrhizal plants when pathogen was introduced at outplanting or one month later. Nematode inoculation affected endomycorrhizal colonization estimated by non vital staining for the Queen Tahiti and Spanish varieties but did not alter development of metabolically active arbuscules in roots of the three varieties. P concentration of endomycorrhizal shoots was higher for all treatments and P. brachyurus tended to decrease mineral concentration of nonmycorrhizal plants with early nematode application.",

Systems analysis was used to accomplish a mathematical model of the position dependent control system. The model developed describes a system which consists of models for the positioning method and the target. An accuracy requirement of ±5 meters for N-fertilization was set with the developed model. The results from Keimola gave information on the variability of soil and wheat yield.

Colony background information and winter loss data were obtained from beekeepers who had taken tracheal mite infested samples. A total of 2116 samples from honey bee colonies of 402 beekeepers were investigated. Infestations were found in 8% of the beekeeping operations and in 10% of the samples inspected. In the last years of the survey more than 20% of apiaries were infested. This increase may be partly explained by tracheal mite infestations found in commercial queen-rearing apiaries. A field experiment with colonies infested at different levels showed that colonies in which 20% or more of bees are infested with tracheal mites have an increased risk of dying during the winter under Finnish conditions. This infestation level was found among colonies in 92% of the infested apiaries. Comparison of the tracheal mite prevalence in apiaries with their winter losses indicated that infestations were associated with colony mortality. The results of this survey point to the high pest potential of the tracheal mite in Finland, in contrast to findings on tracheal mites from elsewhere in Europe. Therefore, strategies to prevent further spread of the mite are highly recommended and methods for effective control should be sought.;",

Half of the animals grew up with free access to swimming water in a basin, the other half to an empty middle cage. Access between the cage containing the nest box and the cage containing the feed was either through the basin/middle cage or through a tunnel above it. Twenty-four hours before observations, the animals were confined without feed to the cage containing the nest box. Observations were carried out over two and a half hours after re-opening one of the access routes to the feed. When access was through the water filled basin, the animals were slower in reaching the feed and crossed between the feed and the nest box fewer times compared to both the same animals using the tunnel and the animals having a dry middle cage. In addition, animals scratched more at the blocked tunnel access when the available route was through the water than when it was through the dry middle cage. The results led to the conclusion that, under some circumstances, water can act as a barrier when farm minks are approaching feed. This indicates that water for swimming is not necessarily an environmental enrichment for, and that the lack of it would not impair the welfare of ranch mink.;",

The study is primarily methodological with the focus on development of a method for measuring technological change and on testing this method. The study is divided into a theoretical and an empirical part. The most common methods for measuring technological change are examined in the theoretical part of the study together with the concepts connected with a technological change and its characteristics. The empirical part tests the applicability of the measuring method based on the CES function for estimating the parameters of technological change in agriculture. To a great extent the parameter estimates calculated conform with what was anticipated. Technological change will continue to be a very important source of productivity growth. By adapting to new technology our small farms can develop very fast in terms of structure and productivity. It appears that technological development will continue to proceed along the lines described in this study in the near future. Technological change can be expected to be capital-using and labour-saving. It will also have a considerable influence on increasing output, especially in cattle husbandry.",

    "abstract": "Leaf protein was extracted from different green crops in 11 pilot plant esperiments. Of the crops, 4 were grass, 6 clover and one pea. The extraction of juice was on average 55 % of the fresh weight of the green crop and the values for dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) were 22.6 and 24.1 %. Clover gave better recoveries of protein than grass. In the leaf protein concentrate (LPC) obtained from the juice, the separation ratios for DM, CP and TP (true protein) were, respectively, 23.7 %, 48.0 and 80.7 %. Heating to 85°C gave more efficient recoveries of LPC than the combination of heating and acid precipitation. The average DM content of the pressed pulp was 30.4 %, the corresponding value for the whole crop being 16.5 %. Measured on a DM basis, the CP content of the pressed pulp was only 0.4 % units lower than in untreated forage, but the crude fibre content was 7.3 % units higher. In vitro organic matter digestibility and the pepsin-HCI solubility of crude protein were on average 5.1 and 5.5 % units lower in the pulp. The average DM of the plant juice was 6.5 % and contained 21.9 % ash, 21.5 % CP, 10.7 % TP and 29.9 % soluble sugars. Clover and pea had much higher values for CP and TP than grass. In the LPC preparations, CP and TP averaged 43.6 % and 38.5 % of DM. Heat treatment gave higher protein content than precipitation of LPC by combined heating and acidification. The in vitro digestibility and protein solubility of LPC were high, on average 85.6 % and 80.2 %. LPC had fairly high contents of lysine and methionine, 4.1 % and 1.6 g/16 g N. There were only small differences in the amino acid composition between grass and clover and between crops harvested at different growth stages. Green crop fractionation is a potential means of improving grassland production and utilization. Promising results have been obtained with plant juice and LPC fed to monogastric animals and pressed pulp residues in diets for ruminants. The economic aspects of fractionation remain to be evaluated.",

Diet 1 contained Span rapeseed meal (RSM) 17% and pea 5 %, diet 2 RSM 8 % and fish meal 4 %, and diet 3 (control) soybean meal (SBM) 5.5 % and fish meal 4 %. The daily rations were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous, and contained digestive crude protein (DCP), lysine and S-amino acids according to standards. The feeds were steam pelleted, and the pigs were fed using a one-diet system and restrictive feeding. The only clear difference between diets was the poorer palatability of those containing RSM, especially of diet 2. The feeding of groups 1 and 2 was therefore actually unrestrictive. The average daily intake of f.u./pig was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower in group 2. Some tail biting occurred in group 2. The growth results were equal for diets 1 and 3, and nonsignificantly poorer for diet 2. The average daily gains of groups 1, 2 and 3 were 813, 788 and 820 g, and the f.u./kg gain 2.74, 2.78 and 2.74, respectively. In carcass characteristics there were no differences between diets: the side fat was 20.3, 21.3 and 20.9 mm, and the area of l. dorsi 36.7, 37.8 and 37.7cm2, respectively. No odd tastes in fat or meat were observed. The results indicate that quite a high level of Span ROM in steam pelleted diet can be fed and still produce high daily gain. The combination of RCM with other feed ingredients seems to have an extra influence on the palatability and nutritive value of the diet. Because RSM makes the diet more bulky and less palatable, the pigs can be fed ad libitum without negative effect on the carcass quality.",

Twenty milligrams of urea was incubated for 5 hours in 40 ml of sheep rumen fluid-buffer solution (1:1) together with 1.5 grams of substrate. The substrate consisted of vacuum-dried and milled feeds: barley (25 %), molassed beet pulp (25 %) and NaOH-treated straw (50 %). The feeds and urea were used in the same proportions as in the diet of the sheep which yielded the rumen fluid for incubation. Treatment with HCHO decreased hydrolysis of urea to ammonia. The ammonia concentration in contents offer mentors 2 hours after the start of incubation had a highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) negative correlation (r = -0.976, n = 72) with the HCHO treatment level. Microbial protein synthesis was calculated from tungstic acid - sulphuric acid precipitation. Synthesis of protein, expressed as grams of nitrogen per 100 grams fermented organic matter was highest when F1.5-F3.0 urea was used. Treatment with more than 3 % of HCHO decreased the number of protozoa and the general activity of the microbes, thus decreasing fermentation of organic matter and lowering the yield of microbial protein. When F1.5 urea was used, the total yield (mg protein/hr) was significantly higher than with untreated urea, but the results obtained with F1.5 urea did not differ significantly from those with F0.75 or F2.0 urea.",

In the isotherm A the P exchange was expressed as a function of P concentration in the initial solution, in the isotherm B as a function of P concentration in the final equilibrium solution. Both isotherms conformed to the equation y = a + bx, where y stands for the amount of P sorbed or desorbed and x the P concentration in the solution. In the isotherm A the constant a is the intensity factor expressing the amount of water soluble P at a given soil-solution ratio. The term a in the isotherm B, on the contrary, was only poorly related to water soluble P in soil. In both isotherms the slope b of the line seemed to be most effectively affected by oxalate extractable Al. The relative importance of oxalate soluble Fe appeared to be greater in affecting the effectiveness of sorption-desorption reactions than in affecting the buffer reactions. However, the slope b of both isotherms was found to be a semi-intensive parameter: it was quite markedly dependent also on soil characteristics which control the level of water soluble P in soil. The ratio of the term —a to b (termed as EBS or EPC), expressing the zero point of net P exchange, varied from 0.003 to 13.89 mg P per liter, the lowest values tending to be in the heavy clay soils and the highest ones in the non-clay soils. The practical significance of this quantity was discussed.",

    "abstract": "Chive is a perennial herb, growing also natural in Finland. Commercial production of the herb is very small in our country, but large amounts of chive are imported. This fact has aroused interest in investigating the opportunities of producing chive using modern cultivation techniques. Effects of cultivar, plastic mulch as ground cover and fertilisation on yield were studied in field experiments over three years. In the experiments, the most productive cultivars or populations (a Finnish population Hankoniemi, a Dutch population Tavallinen and a German cultivar Grolau) produced 1020% higher yields than the less productive cultivars. There were no clear differences in the yield quality between the cultivars. Black plastic mulch was effective in increasing yield, controlling weeds and maintaining soil moisture. For fertilisation, the experiments revealed the high nutrient demand of chive. After the basic soil fertilisation, weekly fertigation with a NPK fertiliser at a higher nitrogen dose (10-15 kg ha -1 N per week) resulted in higher biomass production than fertigation with nitrogen alone and/or a half nitrogen dose. In the years following the planting, the annual uptakes in yield were 185-200 kg ha -1 for nitrogen, 17-20 kg ha -1 for phosphorus, and 120-140 kg ha -1 for potassium in the most intensively fertilised treatment producing the highest yield. The results show that chive is feasible for commercial production with modern cultivation techniques.;",

    "abstract": "During 1975—1977, studies were carried out on the fungus diseases of field bean and attempts were made to find, through seed-dusting trials, suitable methods for their control. The fungal flora in a total of 43 seed lots containing 140—200 seeds each were determined. In addition, plant samples collected from farms where field beans were under cultivation and field bean cultivar trials in seven localities were analysed. The weather conditions in the growing seasons of 1975 and 1977 were rather exceptional, the former being dry and warm and the latter rainy and cool. Ripe crops were obtained from the control experiments, in which the seeds of 3—4 field bean cultivars were dusted with thiram and benomyl preparations, only in 1975 and 1976. Ascochyta fabae Speg. was rare in all the seed samples apart from those from Länsi-Hahkiala, where the degree of infection varied, depending on the cultivar, from 1.3—20 %. Botrytis fabae Sard. was rare in the seeds, B. cinerea Pers. ex Fr. quite common in 1976 and especially in 1977. The frequency of the Fusarium fungi were very great on the seeds in 1977, F. culmorum (W. G. Sm.) Sacc. and F. avenaceum (Fr.) Sacc. being the most common. A. fabae was quite common in the stand samples collected at Länsi-Hahkiala in 1975 and 1976. The chocolate spot-causing agents, B. fabae and B. cinerea, were relatively rare in all years except 1977, when some cultivars were heavily infested by B. cinerea.",

Cellular freezing tolerance was studied using ion leakage tests and the sensitivity of the photosynthetic apparatus to freezing and high light intensity stress by measuring changes in chlorophyll fluorescence (FV/FM) and oxygen evolution. Exposure to high light intensities after freezing stress increased frost injury significantly in all genotypes studied. Compared with S. tuberosum cultivars, the hybrids were more tolerant both of freezing and intense light stresses. In field experiments the mechanism of frost injury varied according to the severity of night frosts. During night frosts in 1999, the temperature inside the potato canopy was significantly higher than at ground level, and did not fall below the lethal temperature for potato cultivars (from -2.5 to -3.0°C). As a result, frost injury developed slowly, indicating that damage occurred to the photosynthetic apparatus. However, as the temperature at ground level and inside the canopy fell below -4°C, cellular freezing occurred and the canopy was rapidly destroyed. This suggests that in the field visual frost damage can follow from freezing or non-freezing temperatures accompanied with high light intensity. Therefore, in an attempt to improve low temperature tolerance in potato, it is important to increase tolerance to both freezing and chilling stresses.",

Vibrio costicolus, Achromobacter 22, Achromobacter guttatus, Achromobacter X, Escherichia coli, or Proteus vulgaris. Sausage without any inoculation and sausage containing Micrococcus sp. + Lactobacillus plantarum were used as references. Aeromonas x and 19 strains had a very favourable effect on the quality of dry sausage when inoculated together with lactobacilli. Both strains reduced nitrate, and the colour formed during the first 3 days. The pH value of Aeromonas + Lactobacillus sausages decreased so quickly that the consistency of these sausages developed within one week and was at least as good as, and often firmer than in Micrococcus + Lactobacillus sausages. The consistency of Aeromonas 19 + Lactobacillus sausages was better at the 0.05 significance level than that of Micrococcus + Lactobacillus samples. The aroma and flavour of Aeromonas + Lactobacillus sausages were as good as or better than those of Micrococcus 4- Lactobacillus sausages. The aroma and flavour of Aeromonas 19 + Lactobacillus sausages were significantly better (significance level 0.001) than Micrococcus-f Lactobacillus sausages. The flavour of Aeromonas x + Lactobacillus sausages was better at the 0.05 level than Micrococcus + Lactobacillus sausages. The number of bacteria, roughly the number of lactobacilli. was often significantly higher in Aeromonas + Lactobacillus sausages (range 2—4 x 108/g between 3 and 21 days of ripening) than in Micrococcus + Lactobacillus sausages (range 8 X 107 1.5 X 108/g between 3 and 21 days of ripening). For this reason the former sausages ripened more quickly than the latter. Vibrio 21 and three Achromobacter strains did not thrive in dry sausage and disappeared during the first 7 days of ripening. When inoculated together with lactobacilli, Escherichia coli had almost as favourable an effect as micrococci on the quality of dry sausage. Inoculations of E. coli alone and Proteus vulgaris, both alone and with lactobacilli, did not improve the quality of dry sausage. P. vulgaris actually had a detrimental effect. Conclusion The investigation has proved that gram-negative bacterial strains Aeromonas x and 19 inoculated with lactobacilli improve the quality of dry sausage and that, especially with the Aeromonas 19 + Lactobacillus inoculum, better dry sausage was obtained than with micrococci and lactobacilli.",

    "abstract": "In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde untersucht, welche Auswirkungen eine Verringerung der Nitrit- und Nitratzusätze auf die Reifung und Eigenschaften der Rohwurst hat. Der Arbeit lag die Aufgabe zugrunde, Empfehlungen über die optimale Dosierung dieser Zusatzstoffe unter Berücksichtigung der Forderung auszuarbeiten, dass sich daraus kein durch pathogene Bakterien bedingtes erhöhtes gesundheitliches Risiko und keine technologischen Schwierigkeiten ergeben dürfen. Die Untersuchung gliedert sich in drei Teile. In den Präliminarversuchen wurden der Einfluss des Nitrit- und/oder Nitratzusatzes auf die Eigenschaften der Rohwurst untersucht; auf Grund der Ergebnisse wurden dann die Herstellungsvorschriften gewählt. Die mit verringertem Nitrit- und/oder Nitratzusatz hergestellten Würste wurden in technologischer Hinsicht (vergleichende Versuche) und in bezug auf das Salmonellenwachstum (Salmonellenversuche) an Würsten mit den üblichen Zusätzen verglichen. Insgesamt umfasste die Untersuchung 208 Versuchswurstchargen. Die Präliminarversuche umfassten 16 Doppelversuchsreihen und dienten dazu, die Auswirkungen verschiedener Nitrit- und Nitratzusätze auf die Eigenschaften der Rohwurst unter verschiedenen Verhältnissen klarzustellen. Als Starterkultur für die Würste wurden entweder Micrococcus sp. (Baktoferment 61) oder Lactobacillus plantarum + Micrococcus sp. (Duploferment 66) verwendet. 1. Das zugesetzte oder aus Nitrat reduzierte Nitrit hemmte deutlich das Wachstum der Laktobazillen, nicht aber das Wachstum der Mikrokokken. Eine Verringerung des Nitritzusatzes von 100ppm auf 50 ppm und des Nitratzusatzes von 125ppm auf 62,5 ppm oder darunter hatte ein zu kräftiges Bakterienwachstum und einen zu starken pH-Abfall zur Folge. Die niedrigsten Konzentrationen, die in den Versuchen geprüft wurden 25 ppm NaNO2 und 50 ppm KNO3 ergaben noch Wurst von beständiger, gleichmässiger Farbe. Durch Zugabe von Askorbinverbindungen konnte die Umrötung beschleunigt weiden. 2. Bei Senkung der Fermentationstemperatur von 26° C auf 18°C verlangsamte sich die Nitratreduktion. Gleichzeitig nahm die Maximalkonzentration des durch Reduktion aus Nitrat gebildeten Nitrits ab. Der End-pH blieb mit abnehmender Reifetemperatur höher. Zwischen bei gleicher Temperatur hergestellten Nitrit- und Nitrat-Würsten wurden keine Unterschiede beobachtet. Die vergleichenden Versuchsreihen wurden sechsmal, die Salmonellen-Versuchsreihen zweimal durchgeführt. 3. Bei gleichzeitigem Zusatz von Glukono-delta-Lakton (GdL) hatte eine Verringerung des Nitritzusatzes von 200 ppm auf 100 ppm oder beim Arbeiten mit Starterkulturen (Duploferment 66) eine Verringerung des Nitratzusatzes von 300 ppm auf 150 ppm oder dessen Substitution durch 50 ppm NaNO2 und 75 ppm KNO3 keine statistisch signifikante Verschlechterung des Geruchs, des Geschmacks oder der Schnittflächenfarbe zur Folge; allerdings lieferte der niedrigere Nitritzusatz bei GdL Wursten eine schwächere Wurstoberflächenfarbe als höherer Zusatz. 4. Die Verringerung des Nitrit- oder Nitratzusatzes oder das Arbeiten mit einem Nitrit-Nitrat-Gemisch hatte keinen Einfluss auf die physikalischen und mikrobiologischen Eigenschaften der Würste oder auf das Wachstum von Salmonella senftenberg, die bei den GdL-Wursten zahlenmässig auf null oder nahezu null, bei den Starterkultur- Würsten auf ein Zehntel der ursprünglichen Zahl zurückging. 5. Der Restnitritgehalt bewegte sich bei den GdL-und den Starterkultur Würsten in der gleichen Grössenordnung (10—l5 ppm NaNO2), wohingegen der Gehalt an Restnitrat der GdL- Würste drei bis fünfmal (ungefähr 100 ppm KNO3) so hoch wie bei den Starterkultur- Würsten (20—28 ppm KNO3) lag. 6. Der gegenseitige Vergleich von GdL- Würstenund Starterkultur- Würsten ergab, dass der pH bei ersteren schneller abnahm, jedoch auf einem höheren Wert zum Stillstand kam. Als Folge dieser Erscheinung hatten die Starterkultur- Würste die bessere Konsistenz und Farbbeständigkeit; ausserdem waren sie den GdL- Würsten geschmacklich liberlegen. 7. In sämtlichen Versuchen kam in sehr augenfälliger Weise der Nitritschwund mit Erreichen von pH 5,0 zum Stillstand. Die Ursache dieser Erscheinung wurde diskutiert. Bei der Nitratreduktion lag der »Wendepunkt» im pH-Bereich von 5,2—5,3, trat aber nicht in so ausgeprägter Form in Erscheinung wie beim Nitritschwund. Schlussfolgerungen: Auf Grund der vorliegenden Untersuchung und der damit verbundenen Literaturauswertung wurde festgestellt, dass bei Zusatz von 100 ppm NaNO2 oder 150 ppm KNO3 oder einer Mischung aus 50 ppm NaNO2 und 75 ppm KNO3 eine technologisch und gesundheitlich sichere Rohwurstherstellung gewährleistet ist. Voraussetzung für die Verwendung der verringerten Nitrit- oder Nitratzusätze ist allerdings, dass dabei gleichzeitig GdL oder Starterkulturen zum Einsatz kommen. Dadurch wird ein genügend rascher pH-Abfall in den gewünschten pH-Bereich (pH 5,3—4,8) erzielt.",

In general, multi-rowed varieties were significantly earlier than two-rowed varieties. In single-plant trials the two-rowed barleys, due to their good tillering capacity, gave a larger biological yield than the multi-rowed barleys. Grain yield in single-plant trials was in the south higher from the two-rowed varieties but in the north from the multirowed varieties.

Using a standard comparative static partial equilibrium analysis in the Marshallian economic surplus framework, the welfare effects are calculated for eight major cereal and livestock commodities produced in Finland for the year 2003. The results suggest that farmers, despite the growth in direct payments, have incurred large annual welfare losses ranging from EUR 570 to EUR 600 million. Consumers, on the other hand, have gained from the accession between EUR 815 and 875 million annually. The taxpayers have gained  as a result of the decrease in the direct subsidies and export restitutions paid by the national budget  between EUR 470 and EUR 580 million.

    "abstract": "During the last three years, 1964—66, investigations on sprinkler irrigation of spring cereals have been carried out. The experimental fields were clay soils in Southern Finland. Neutral river and lake waters containing small amounts of soluble salts were applied in the nighttime. The application rate of the rotary sprinklers used was 2.5—4 mm per hour with the radius of 12±2 m. With this technique the experimental soils having poor structure endured the irrigation without any crust formation. It was found that the sprinklers equipped with two nozzles distributed the water more uniformly than those with one nozzle. With the former sprinklers a fairly good uniformity was attained: The amount of water usually varied between 25 and 35 mm with an average of 30 mm, except in a relatively small area nearest to the sprinklers which received too much water and in the area at the greatest distance from the sprinklers with less than the average amounts of water. The soil water conditions were followed by gypsum blocks inserted at different depths. In each experimental year, within 2—3 weeks from sprouting, the available water in the top soils decreased to 50 per cent of the total capacity. This dry condition existed for two months in the years 1964 and 1966 and for one month in 1965. During these dry periods the top soils were near the wilting point for a long time, and in 1966 the available water was wholly exhausted. The influence of transpiration was effective also in deeper layers. In 1966, the soil reached the wilting point also at the depth of 40 cm and stayed at this condition for about one month. The effect of a 30—37 mm irrigation on the soil moisture conditions lasted only for 1—2 weeks. Thus, the rate of evapotranspiration was as much as 4 mm per day. The plants consumed water simultaneously from the whole root zone, yet, most effectively from the surface layers. The top soil (20 cm in thickness) which had reached the wilting point was not completely moistened by the amounts of water applied. This indicates the high capacity of clay soils to store water. It is also noteworthy that a part of irrigation water percolated to 40 cm before the soil at the depths of 10 and 20 cm had time to get to the field capacity. In experimental years, to ensure favourable moisture conditions to spring cereals several high applications of water would have been needed. This proves that also during the short growing season in Finland a serious shortage of water may occur.",

    "abstract": "Als Zusammenfassung über die bisherigen Ergebnisse kann dargestellt werden: Die subjektive Punktbewertung ist unsicher als Indikator der Schlachtkörperbeschaffenheit und vor allem des Fettgehalts sowie der Muskelstärke des Schlachtkörpers. Desgleichen sind unsichere Indikatoren der Schlachtkörperbeschaffenheit die an lebenden Tieren aufgenommenen äusseren Masse (z.B. Längen-, Breiten-, Höhen- und Umfansmass). Die Ultraschallmessungen sind das wichtigste und auch für praktische Verhältnisse gut geeignete Verfahren, die Dicke des Speckes zu bestimmen. Als Beispiel sei angeführt, dass der mit einem Ultraschallgerät an 236 Schweinen gemessene Rückenspeck diese Komponente Schlachtkörpers (r = 0.81) und ebenfalls der am lebenden Tier gemessene Seitenspeck ebendiesen An teil am Schlachtkörper (r = 0.79) gut vorhersagte. Eine wirksame Auswertung des Ultraschallgeräts bei Bestimmung des Phänotyps bedeutet eine Intensivierung der Züchtungsarbeit zugunsten der Schlachtkörperbeschaffenheit (JONSSON 1967), eine beträchtliche Zunahme in der Anzahl der in den Kreis der Auslese gelangenden Tiere und zugleich eigentlich die einzige brauchbare Weise, die Säue mit in die Zuchtwahl einzubeziehen. Bei diesem Stand kommt man dazu, den Fleischgehalt des Schlachtkörpers nur durch teilweise Zerlegung und Dissektion der Schlachtkörper befriedigend zu messen. Die Untersuchung erweist u.a., dass durch Zerschneiden des Schinkens sowie des Kotelettabschnittes in Fett + Haut als den einen Teil und in Fleisch + Knochen als den anderen Teil über die Komponente Fett + Haut wie auch die Komponente Fleisch + Knochen der wertvollsten Partie der Schlachtkörperhälfte ein besseres Bild gewonnen worden ist als durch die gesamte herkömmliche Schlachtkörperbewertung (n = 97). Aus Tabelle 2 lässt sich ersehen, dass zwischen den Korrelationskoeffizienten des Teiles Fett + Haut und des Teiles Fleisch + Knochen ein ziemlich schwacher Zusammenhang besteht. Die Folge davon dürfte sein, dass man bei sich verdünnendem Rückenspeck des Schweines dazu kommt, bei der Züchtung gerade dem Messen der Fleischeigenschaften des Tieres stets grössere Aufmerksamkeit zuwendet, weil der Verringerung der Fettmenge des Schlachtköpers eine in gleicher Grössenordnung erfolgende Zunahme der Fleischmenge gar nich mehr entspricht. Bei Erforschung des ausgelesenen Stammversuchsmaterials dürften wir uns schon in dieser Situation befinden. Für den Teil des statistischen Verarbeitungssystems scheinen die Ergebnisse vielversprechend. Im Anschluss an einen zweckmässigen Versuchsplan vermittelt das automatisierte Datenverarbeitungssystem bei den mit Fleischfragen verbundenen Untersuchungen brauchbare Kenntnis: Mit Hilfe der Faktorenanalyse werden die der Forschung als Gegenstand vorliegenden Variablen oder Eigenschaften zu Merkmalgruppen zusammengefasst. Durch wählende Regressionsanalysen werden die Modelle für jede in der Gruppe dominierende Eigenschaft oder eine aus der Sicht der Untersuchung sonstwie interessante Eigenheit aufgebaut. Die Gesamtvariation jeder gemessenen Eigenschaft oder jedes gemessenen Zuges wird nach der Methode der kleinsten Quadrate analysiert. So erhält man die Bewertung des relativen Anteils der Umwelt- und der erblichen Faktoren an der Gesamtvariation jeder Eigenschaft.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to examine the import dependency of domestic food and service sectors in Finland and produce indicators for measuring the import content of these sectors together with the import dependency of the inputs supplied into these sectors. Input–output analysis is utilised to provide the necessary information on the interdependencies and linkages between different industries for both goods and services in the Finnish economy. Primary agriculture, food processing, distribution and food service providers in Finland are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels concerning energy and chemical inputs, including high reliance on imported supplementary protein feed for livestock production. However, most of the inputs supplied to the Finnish food and service sectors are domestic because only 20% of the total output is dependent on imported goods, services, and capital goods. The rate of self-sufficiency in food supply is high in Finland, but international trade is essential to provide the necessary energy and chemical inputs needed for food production along with livestock’s supplementary protein feed. Replacing fossil energy with sustainable renewable energy will reduce the dependence on Russia for energy supply and promoting human consumption of plant-based foods will reduce the demand for livestock feed.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to verify the applicability of a mass balance method for estimating nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content in the solid organic fertiliser produced from cattle manure in North-West Russia. The study compared the relevant established norms in Russia, the data calculated by the mass balance method, and the average experimental data on N and P content in cattle manure (ex-housing) and the organic fertilizer ready to use from the selected cattle-breeding complex with 1250 heads and a manure output of 70 t day-1. Three animal categories were considered. The difference between the calculated and experimental data was 10% maximum but the experimental data and the established norms differed by above 15%. This proves the demand to revise the norms in the Russian regulatory documents to improve the accuracy of fertiliser application rates and the estimation of agricultural land required. Even an increase of 10% in the nutrient content of the organic fertiliser results in an increase in the required agricultural land from 451 to 526 ha for spreading the organic fertiliser from the 1250 heads of cattle at the selected farm.",

In all groups, meat samples were characterized by color typical of pork, high water-holding capacity and low pH values. A sensory analysis of the eating quality attributes of meat revealed that they were highly satisfactory; only aroma intensity was affected by the experimental factor. The study demonstrated that growing-finishing pigs can be fed complete diets containing the analyzed vegetable protein sources alternative to GM-SBM without compromising carcass or meat quality.",

The hens were housed at 16 weeks of age in furnished cages in groups of 8 birds. The experiment lasted for 205 days. The treatments were: perches present from 16 weeks of age (P16), perches present from 19 weeks of age (P19), and no perches present (NP). Feed consumption and egg production were measured over the pre-laying period and six 4-week laying periods. The number of hens on perch, in nest and litter box was recorded at various ages. The behaviour of 3 hens per treatment was observed using instantaneous sampling at every 5 minutes, so that the observations of each hen covered one light period (14.5 hours). The treatments had no significant effects on feed consumption after the pre-laying period. Feed conversion ratio (kg feed kg-1 eggs) was favourable in P16 in comparison to NP during the periods 24. During the observations after the lights-out NP birds tended to be more frequently in nests, than P16 birds. NP birds spent more time on the cage floor, were recumbent more often, and sitting more rarely in comparison to P16 birds. Based on the results of this study, perches may have advantageous effect on feed conversion ratio in furnished cages.;",

    "abstract": "The seeding of grasslands in Finland fails relatively often owing to the difficult growing conditions for the young seedlings. As a result, the stands are in many cases rather thin and must sometimes be ploughed up without giving any yield at all. One of the factors hampering the initial growth and development of grassland plants is unsuitable sowing. Thus, for instance, a considerable proportion of the seed may be sown at too great a depth, which prevents the seedlings from emerging. On the other hand, the seeds scattered upon the soil surface will also meet difficulties in their germination stage, especially in dry periods. Hence, a valuable characteristic for a grassland plant seedling would be the ability to surmount the various obstacles arising from deficient seeding measures. The object of the present investigation is to study the emergence capacity of some grassland plants, the majority of which are grown extensively in Finland. For this purpose, seeds of the plants to be studied were sown on soil surface as well as at different depths. The influence of seed size in this connexion was examined, too. All the studies concerned were carried out in the greenhouse. The soil used as substrata in these experiments was heavy clay, representing the valuable arable soil type occurring fairly commonly, especially in Southwest Finland.",

The products examined were selected due to their availability on the market and all of them derived from conventional production. All products examined contained only apples in their composition, with no other fruit added. The obtained results were related to the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of PAT established by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) (WHO 1995). In addition, in selected age groups, exposure assessment resulting from the intake of this toxin in the diet, was estimated. Only 2 of the 47 examined apple products contained PAT. The determined levels of contamination were significantly lower than a maximum acceptable level specified in the provisions of the food law at the level of 50.0 μg kg-1 for apple juice. When considering the value of the average daily consumption of apple juice in Poland, the PAT daily intake from apple juice did not exceed the tolerable daily intake in any of the examined samples and amounted to a maximum of 1.6% of PMTDI. As for one portion recommended for consumption, the result obtained was also below tolerable daily intake and constituted a maximum of 38.7% of PMTDI. These findings are a particularly valuable source of information for farmers, traders and consumers, and confirm health safety of apple juice and apple-based products intended for infants and young children.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of supplemented chestnut hydrolysable tannin (HT) both at ensiling and at feeding on lamb growth, carcass characteristic, and meat quality. Twenty tons of ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were used to produce silage. The ryegrass was treated at ensiling with one of three additives: 30 g kg-1 DM chestnut HT (GET), an inoculant as a positive control (GI), or water as a negative control (G). Another two treatments were made from ensiled grass by adding the 30 g kg-1 DM of chestnut HT to either positive (GI+T) or negative (GT) control. Forty Suffolk cross Mule lambs were used in this experiment and allocated to receive one of five experimental forage treatments with eight lambs per treatment. The diet consisted of two parts: concentrate and silage. Lambs were fed 215 g DM day-1 lamb of concentrate diet and ad libitum grass silage for seven weeks and then slaughtered. Back fat thickness tended to be lower (p= 0.07) for lambs fed the GT and GI+T treatments compared to lambs in the other experimental groups’ (10.0, 10.1, 9.8, 10.0, and 9.8 mm for GET, G, GT, GI, and GI+T, respectively). Feeding lambs GET tended to reduce (p= 0.06) meat lightness (L*) compared to the other treatments. Ammonia nitrogen concentration in rumen fluid was reduced significantly (p&lt; 0.05) when lambs consumed diets treated with tannin both at ensiling and at feeding (0.14, 0.19, 0.17, 0.17 and 0.14g l-1 GET G, GT, GI, and GI+T, respectively). The experimental treatments had no effect (p&gt; 0.05) on voluntary feed intake (914, 916, 899, 928, or 914 g day-1 for GET, G, GT, GI, and GI+T, respectively) or lamb performance.",

    "abstract": "Adding carbonated or non-carbonated lime to clay soils can lead to changes in aggregate stability. In Sweden, ‘structure liming’ with a mixed product (normally 80–85% calcium carbonate and 15–20% calcium hydroxide) is subsidised through environmental schemes to increase aggregate stability, thereby mitigating losses of particulate phosphorus (PP). This study assessed the effects of structure liming on aggregate stability in eight clay soils in southern Sweden, using turbidity as a proxy for aggregate stability. Turbidity in leachate from simulated rain events performed on aggregates (2–5 mm) in the laboratory was measured one and six years after application of four treatments 0, 4, 8 and 16 t ha-1 of a mixed structure liming product. The effect on turbidity was analysed for all application rates, but also as the contrast between the unlimed control and the mean of the limed treatments, to identify the general effect. A significant effect of structure liming on turbidity was found after one year. The effect decreased over time, but was still detectable after six years. However, there was a significant interaction between trial and treatment, indicating different reactions on different soils and suggesting that not all clay soils are suitable for structure liming if the desired objective is to lower the risk of PP losses. Clay content, initial pH and mineralogy may explain the different responses to structure liming. These findings show a need for a site-specific structure liming strategy. As a tentative recommendation, soils with a minimum clay content of approximately 25–30% and pH &lt;7 should be preferred for structure liming.",

Physiological analysis showed decrease of total chlorophyll, shoot dry weight and spikelet shape development and increased activation of MDA, soluble sugar and antioxidant enzymes, with increase of temperatures. However, considering major grain yield components and storage materials, there should be an optimum temperature during ripening period. The result of proteomic analysis showed significantly high expressions of stress-related gene in high temperature treatment and grain storage materials in optimum temperature.

Some observations on the properties of lignin have been made. The lignin content, as calculated from the dry matter or from the total of the membrane substances, varies greatly in different materials, as can be seen in Table 1. This is the case even if one leaves out of consideration such materials as the bark of woods, sea-weeds, and mosses, the »lignin» of which scarcely is real lignin. In grasses and clover the content of lignin in the cell walls increases with the successive stages of development. The methoxyl content of lignin varies in different plants, in the same plant at successive stages of growth, and in the different tissues of the same plant. The solubility of lignin in hot diluted alkali solutions varies in different materials. Of the lignin in Gramineae plants even in an 0.1 N natrium hydroxide solution about 50 % dissolves, but of the lignin of softwoods only negligible amounts in a 2 N solution. The lignin preparations isolated by the usual acid methods contain, besides the real hydrolysis residue, also substances dissolved by the strong acid but precipitated by the succeeding dilution. The nitrogen content of the precipitated fraction is high. The high methoxyl content of its nitrogen free portion points to real lignin.",

The report is based on the material collected by the Agricultural Research Centre, Department of Plant Breeding, from the spring wheat cultivations of South-West Finland and the Department’s trial field at Jokioinen. 1. Black stem rust was quite general in spring wheat throughout the southwest of Finland. In the extreme south-western part of the country the crop losses caused by drought and black stem rust were up to and over 50 per cent. In the eastern district of the area under review the damage by black stem rust was negligible in spite of heavy infection. 2. The coefficient of the correlation between the amount of black stem rust and 1,000 grain weight in the material collected from farms was —0.77 ± 0.04, and in a material obtained from the trial field —0.81 ± 0.05. 3. All the varieties grown in South-West Finland were susceptible to black stem rust. Kärn II, Diamant and Diamant II showed practically the same degree of infection. Thanks to its early ripening, the early Apu wheat in certain cases avoided heavy black stem rust infection. 4. On the trial field the north European varieties proved definitely more susceptible than many of the American varieties. Black stem rust was the most widespread of the wheat rusts in summer 1951 (cf. Table 3). 5. The younger breeding material revealed clearly the general susceptibility to black stem rust of the origins. It also showed the favourable effect on the descendants of the resistant parent strains employed in certain crosses. 6. A study of the origins of the Finnish varieties showed that hardly any varieties resistant to black stem rust have been employed as parents for our present commercial varieties.",

Until 1948 basic slag was used instead of rock phosphate; since that rock phosphate had been applied for ten years. Owing to the large variation in the results from the replicate plots the differences in the phosphorus conditions between the various treatments were less distinct than could have been expected. The accumulation of phosphorus quite in the surface layer was demonstrated. The hay yield produced by the annual dressing with 100 kg/ha of superphosphate in 1957 was equal to that produced by 130 kg/ha of rock phosphate. Also the yields from the treatments with 200 kg/ha of superphosphate or 260 kg/ha of rock phosphate were equal in size, but a significant difference was found in the phosphorus content of hay. In the superphosphate plots the P-content was about 0.21—0.23 per cent of dry matter, whereas in the rock phosphate plots only 0.14—0.15 per cent P in the dry matter was found.",

    "abstract": "An attempt was made to elucidate the content of plant-available calcium, potassium and magnesium in different kinds of virgin peat. The amounts of these cations extracted by 1 N ammonium chloride solution were supposed to give an estimate satisfactory for this purpose. Also the extractable sodium was determined. The material consisted of 208 samples mainly collected from Northern Finland. The variation in the content of extractable cations was high in all the peat groups. The individual values of one group were overlapping the range of other ones. The average calcium and magnesium contents of the Sp, CSp and SCp groups were somewhat lower than those of Cp, BCp and EuSCp groups. The same seems to be the case, with the content of extractable sodium whereas the moss peats tended to be slightly less poor in potassium than the peats of better quality. A more or less significant correlation existed in all the peat groups between the calcium content and the pH-values. The correlation was markedly lower for pH and extractable magnesium. A weak tendency to negative correlation could be noticed between pH and extractable potassium. The land quality and the calcium and magnesium content of all the surface samples were correlated with each other, although not very strongly. Within the different peat groups no correlation between these quantities could be found, except in one case. The scant supply of potassium in the surface samples did not show any connection with the land quality. The reasons responsible to the large variation of the nutrient content within a certain peat group were discussed. The fact was emphasized that on the basis of the identification of the kind of peat nothing reliable is known of the nutrient content of the sample.",

Tämä menettely on johtunut seuraavista seikoista. On tutkittu kysymyksiä, kuten maan lämpöolojen vuotuisia vaihteluja ja eri maalajien lämpöoloja. Kun kasvipeitteellä on merkitystä maan lämpötilaan, olisi kasvipeite saattanut häiritä tutkimuksia siinä mielessä, ettei se kaikkina vuosina ja kaikilla tutkimuspaikoilla olisi ollut samanlainen. Samanlaiset olosuhteet pystyttiin luomaan parhaiten siten, että maan pinta pidettiin paljaana. Tällä tavoin suoritetut tutkimukset eivät anna kuitenkaan oikeata kuvaa maan lämpöoloista kasvien kasvupaikalla muuta kuin siihen saakka, jolloin kasvin maanpäälliset osat alkavat varjostaa maan pintaa. Tämän vuoksi on koeasemalla suoritettu maan lämpötilanmittauksia myös kasvillisuuden kohdalla. Lämpötilamittaukset suoritettiin termoelementeillä 10, 20 ja eräänä vuonna myös 100 cm:n syvyyksissä. Tuloksista ilmeni, että sen jälkeen kun vilja alkoi varjostaa maata, vuorokauden keskilämpötila muodostui 10 ja 20 cm:n syvyyksissä alhaisemmaksi kuin maan pinnan ollessa paljas. Tavallisimmat lämpötilaerot olivat 3—4°C. Kasvillisuuden vaikutus tuntui myös 100 cm:n syvyyden lämpötilassa.",

Yleisimmin viljelty perunalajikkeemme on Ruusulehti, mutta senkään viljelyala ei ole ollut suurempi kuin 1/8 maan koko peruna-alasta.

    "abstract": "Muddusniemen koetilalla (69°5' pohj. lev., 27°3’ it. pit.) on vuodesta 1947 alkaen suoritettu nurmikasvitutkimuksia. Kenttäkokeet on perustettu uutismaan pelloille, joiden pohjamaa on hiesua ja muokkauskerros erittäin vähämultaista karkeata hietaa, pH 5.5—5.7. Eri vuosina saatujen satojen määrät ovat suuresti vaihdelleet talvien ankaruus- (taulukot 1 ja 2) sekä kesien kosteuseroista (kuva 6 ja 7) johtuen. Paksu lumipeite on yleensä suojellut nurmikasveja paleltumiselta (kuva 1); paleltumisvaurioiden esiintyminen on ollut riippuvainen etupäässä siitä, miten aikaisin lumi on keväällä sulanut. Lumen alla ovat kuitenkin tavituhosienet vioittaneet ja tappaneet nurmikasveja, erityisesti heinäkasvilajeja. Nurmiheinien tuhosienistä pohjolan pahkahome (Selerotinia borealis) on ollut haitallisin (kuvat 2—5). Nurmiheinissä, mutta myös apilassa, on lisäksi esiintynyt Fusarium- ja Typhula-sienien tuhoja. Apilamätää (Selerotinia trifoliorum) on esiintynyt hyvin vähän. Talvituhosienet osoittautuivat vaarallisimmiksi nurmikasvien nuorille oraille ja myös fysiogenisten tekijäin heikentämille kasveille, mm. niille nurmikasvikannoille, jotka yleensäkin ovat puutteellisesti sopeutuneet pohjoisiin olosuhteisiin. S. borealis muodosti syyskuussa runsaasti kotelomaljoja. Nämä sietivät paleltumatta pitkäaikaista ja melko kovaa (—7°C) pakkasta. Kesän aikana ei nurmikasveissa esiintynyt ruostesieniä ollenkaan. Muidenkin tuhosienien merkitys oli vain toisarvoinen. Kesällä 1950 heinän rengaslaikkua (Mastigosporium album) esiintyi kuitenkin siinä määrin, että sillä oli timotein talvehtimista heikentävä vaikutus. V. 1953 ankara pouta aiheutti lähes heinäkadon (kuvat 6 ja 7). Tutkituista 14 nurmikasvilajista osoittautuivat tyydyttävän viljelyvarmuuden ohella satoisimmiksi puna-apila, timotei, nurminata ja nurmipuntarpää (taulukot 3 ja 4). Näistä nurmipuntarpää oli viljelyvarmin ja säilyi nurmissa kauimmin; sen sadon määrä ei seitsemän vuoden kuluessa todettavasti alentunut. Nurmipuntarpää ehti säännöllisesti kehittää tuleentuneen, runsaalta näyttäneen siemensadon. Kolmena ensimmäisenä vuonna kylvön jälkeen timotei oli kuitenkin keskimäärin satoisampi; nurminata oli 1. ja 2. vuoden nurmissa vähintään timotein veroinen, mutta jo 3. vuoden nurmessa selvästi heikkosatoisempi. Puna-apilasta saatiin 2—3 ensimmäisenä vuonna kylvön jälkeen suurin sato. Pohjois-skandinavialaiset apila- ja timoteikannat olivat viljelyvarmemmat kuin kanadalaiset. Apilan viihtyminen oli ratkaisevasti nystyräbakteerisiirrostuksen varassa (kuva 8, taulukko 6). Salpietarilannoitus jonkin verran lisäsi nuoren puna-apilanurmen satoa. Hivenaineilla (Cu, Mn, Bo, Zn ja Mo) ja pohjamaahiesun sekoittamisella muokkauskerrokseen ei ollut todettavaa edullista vaikutusta. Sen sijaan karjanlanta huomattavasti suurensi apilasadon määrää (taulukko 5). Vielä tuntuvampi merkitys oli etelä-Suomesta tuodulla hyvällä siirrostusmaalla; jo 400 kg/ha tällaista peltomaata lisäsi oleellisesti apilan satoa. Siirrostusmaan vaikutus perustui otaksuttavasti sen sisältämään pieneliöstöön, muuhun kuin nystyräbakteeriflooraan. Suojakasvin vaikutus nurmen sadon määrään oh suhteellisen pieni (taulukot 7 ja 8). Sen käytön tarkoituksenmukaisuus rikkaruohottomalla pellolla lienee ensisijaisesti suojakasvin sadon arvosta ja viljelykustannuksesta riippuvainen.",

Trifluralin was studied for two growing seasons. Methabenzthiazuron was the most mobile pesticide and metazachlor was almost as much mobile. They leached at least 15 cm in a month. Fenitrothion and fenvalerate were the most immobile. Trifluralin was the most and fenitrothion the least persistent. The concentrations of iprodione and fenvalerate in the top soils increased towards the autumn, presumably due to leaching of pesticides from plants. The residues of trifluralin measured in the surface layer of the mineral soils at the end of the growing season might have been harfmul to plants sensitive to trifluralin. The residues of trifluralin in the peat soil surface 1.5 years after the treatment were still high. Also methabenzthiazuron, iprodine and fenvalerate residues may in all probability have been detected in the following spring. If the half-life of a pesticide is over 80 - 100 days, it is likely that residues of it may be found in the spring following the application in cultivated Finnish soils.",

BF showed a low digestibility of OM and CP and 0.1 inclusion of BF mixed with BP depressed CP digestibility and N-retention. A higher protein supply from cereal protein in the diet promoted N-retention but decreased protein utilization. OP had high digestibility and OF was more digestible than BF. The study confirmed the high digestibility and energy values of the proteinous grain fractions and a high protein utilization when adequately fortified with lysine.

    "abstract": "The Zn status of cultivated soils of Finland was investigated by chemical analyses and bioassays. The effect on ryegrass of different Zn fertilizers and Zn rates was studied in pot experiments and their effect on barley and timothy in field experiments. In an uncontaminated surface soil material of 72 mineral soils and 34 organogenic soils, total Zn (Zntot) was 10.3-202 mg kg-1(median 66 mg kg-1). In mineral soils, Zntot correlated positively with clay content (r = 0.81***) and in organogenic soils negatively with organic C (r = -0.53***). Zinc bound by organic matter and sesquioxides was sequentially extracted by 0.1 M K4P2O7 (Znpy) and 0.05 M oxalate at pH 2.9 (Znox), respectively. The sum Znpy + Znox, a measure of secondary Zn potentially available to plants, was 2 - 88% of Zntot and was the lowest in clay (median 5%) and highest in peat soils (median 49%). Water-soluble and exchangeable Zn consisted of0.3 - 37% (median 3%) of Zntot, the percentage being higher in acid soils, particularly in peat soils. Zinc was also extracted by 0.5 M ammonium acetate - 0,5 M acetic acid - 0.02 M Na2-EDTA at pH 4.65 (ZnAC), the method used in soil testing in Finland. The quantities of ZnAC (median 2.9 mg dm-3, range 0.6 - 29.9 mg dm-3) averaged 50% and 75% of Znpy + Znox in mineral and organogenic soils, respectively, and correlated closely with Znpy. In soil profiles, ZnAC was with few exceptions higher in the plough layer (0 - 20 cm) than in the subsoil (30 - 100 cm). In an intensive pot experiment on 107 surface soils, four crops of ryegrass took up 2 - 68% (median 26%)of Znpy + Znox. The plant-available Zn reserves were not exhausted even though in a few peat soils the Zn supply to grass decreased over time. Variation of Zn uptake was quite accurately explained by ZnAC but increasing pH had a negative impact on Zn uptake. Application of Zn (10 mg dm-3 of soil as ZnSO4 * 7 H2O) did not give rise to yield increases. In mineral soils, increase of plant Zn concentration correlated negatively with soil pH while ZnAC was of secondary importance. In those organogenic soils in which the reserves of native Zn were the most effectively utilized, plant Zn concentration also responded most strongly to applied Zn. In two 2-year field experiments, Zn application did not increase timothy or barley yields. Zinc concentration of timothy increased from 30 mg kg-1 to 33 and 36 mg kg-1 when 3 or 6 kg Zn ha-1 was applied, respectively. The efficiency of ZnSO4 * 7 H2O alone did not differ from that of a fertilizer where ZnSO4 * 7H20 was granulated with gypsum. Zinc concentration of barley grains increased by foliar sprays of Na2Zn-EDTA but only a marginal response to soil-applied Zn (4.8 or 5.4 kg ha-1 over three years) was detected in three 3-year experiments. High applications of Zn to soil (15 or 30 kg ha-1 as ZnSO4 * 7H2O) were required to increase Zn concentration of barley markedly. In order to prevent undue accumulation of fertilizer Zn in soil, it is proposed that Zn fertilizer recommendations for field crops should be based on both soil pH and ZnAC. In slightly acid and neutral soils, even if poor in Zn, response of plant Zn concentration to applied Zn remains small while there is a high response in strongly acid soils.",

In the conventional cropping systems, industrial fertilisers and chemical pesticides were used according to practices adopted on actual farms in Southern Finland. In the organic cropping systems, plant nutrition was based on biological N fixation by legumes and organic manures. No chemical pesticides were used. The average yield of barley in organic cropping varied between one quarter and half of that in conventional cropping. The yields of winter wheat, oats and potato were about 40 % of those obtained conventionally. The yields of clover-grass leys in organic farming were similar to those of grass-leys in the conventional system. Unfortunately, the clover-grass leys outwintered after the first year. The primary reason for the poor crop growth in the organic cropping systems was apparently the acute N deficiency caused by poor performance of legumes, low N content of organic manures and N losses in anaerobic conditions often occurring during winter and early spring. Pronounced soil compaction and anaerobic conditions in organic cropping systems had a harmful effect on the microbiological activity of soil as well as on earthworms. Weeds, plant diseases and insects were not a remarkable problem in any of the cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "The viability of microblade-bisected Day-7 embryos transferred to recipients without zona pellucidae directly after splitting or after overnight storage at 4°C was investigated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, 26 demi-embryos of excellent or good quality and two of fair quality were transferred to 28 heifer recipients 1-3 h after splitting. The transfers resulted in 20 pregnancies (71.4% pregnancy rate), and 19 calves were born (one pregnant heifer was slaughtered). Another 14 demi-embryos were cultured 1 to 3 h at room temperature, transported for 3 h at 8-10°C and stored for 12 h in a refigerator at 4°C, Twelve of the 14 demi-embryos were considered transferable after storage and nine of these were transferred to nine recipients, of which five became pregnant. Four live calves were born. In Experiment 2, 21 excellent or good quality demi-embryos were transferred into 21 heifer recipients to produce 12 pregnancies (57.1%) and 10 live calves. Another 19 demi-embryos (17 excellent to good quality and two fair quality) were transferred after storage for 1-2 h at 8°C and 18 h at 4°C. Five recipients became pregnant, of which four delivered live calves. It is concluded that a high pregnancy rate can be achieved after the transfer of fresh demi-embryos produced by a simple method of embryo bisection under farm conditions. Although the transfer of demi-embryos stored overnight at 4°C results in decreased pregnancy rates, refrigeration of demiembryos may be useful in certain practical situations. However, further experiments are needed to determine the optimal conditions for overnight storage of demi-embryos.",

Dry matter (DM) intake of lucerne silage was higher than that of grass silage (1.77 vs. 1.40 kg DM day-1).

In fresh and preserved lucerne, the amount of coumestrol was only moderate varying from zero to 59.5 ppm DM. Ewes fed lucerne received higher amounts of plant oestrogens than those on control feeding, but no differences in conception rate or lambing performance were found between the groups. However on lucerne, ewes conceived five days earlier (P=0.03) than control animals. Prolificacy of lucerne and control fed ewes averaged 3.13 and 3.19 lambs/ewe (P=0.76), respectively. There were no ewe health problems. The results suggest that the intake of yellow-flowered lucerne is good and the level of plant oestrogens has no detrimental effects on reproductive performance of adult Finnish Landrace ewes. ;",

Progeny of these matings were evaluated for performance traits including ewe reproduction through 3 years of age. Averaged over dam breeds, there was no significant difference between B and F sires for conception rate (CR), litter size (LS) at birth or weaning or for lamb mortality to weaning. The difference among sire breeds was not large or significant for birth weight but F sired lambs were significantly heavier than B sired lambs at 63 and 147 days of age. Relative to F sired lambs, B sired lambs had a higher dressing percentage and less fat at the 12th rib but equal estimated percentage kidney fat. A significantly smaller percentage of B-C3 than F, F-C3 or B-F ewe lambs reached puberty by the end of their first breeding season. Ovulation rate at first mating was higher but embryo survival rate tended to be lower for B sired ewes than for F sired ewes. At 2 years of age, B sired ewes produced about 1 kg more wool than F sired ewes. With the exception of the very poor CR of B-C3 ewes at first parity, the differences between the four ewe genotypes were not large or significant for CR at first, second and third parity. The difference between B and F sired ewes in LS at birth was not significant at first parity but B sired ewes were more prolific at second and third parities. However, differences in lamb mortality reduced, and in some cases removed, the differences in LS by weaning time. Relative use of these breeds in commercial U.S. production schemes is discussed.",

The temperature of the other part of the field (open field) was not elevated, but the field was covered with the same plastic film as the greenhouse to achieve radiation and rainfall conditions comparable to those in the greenhouse. To elevate the CO2 concentrations, four open top chambers (OTC) were built for the greenhouse, and four for the open field. Two of these, both in the greenhouse and in the open field, were supplied with pure CO2 to elevate their CO2 level to 700 ppm. The temperatures inside the greenhouse followed accurately the desired level. The relative humidity was somewhat higher in the greenhouse and in the OTC:s than in the open field, especially after the modifications in the ventilation of the greenhouse and in the OTC:s in 1994. Because the OTC:s were large (3 m in diameter), the temperatures inside them differed very little from the surrounding air temperature. The short-term variation in the CO2 concentrations in the OTC:s with elevated CO2 was, however, quite high. The control of the CO2 concentrations improved each year from 1992 to 1994, as the CO2 supplying system was modified.

    "abstract": "Competition between barley and oats, and yield performance of mixtures were evaluated in a two component replacement series field experiment at two levels of nitrogen applications (80 kgN/ha and 120 kgN/ha). Three barley cultivars (Aapo, Agneta ja Ida) and one oats cultivar (Veli) were used. The competitive relationship was independent of the pure stand yield of the cultivar. Ida and Agneta were more competitive than oats irrespective of nitrogen dose. Ida was the most dominant variety which was very likely due to the early development of the seedlings. Oats was slightly more competitive than the shortest cultivar Aapo at high nitrogen, although barley seedlings emerged before oats. Thus the competitive ability of a cultivar was not determined by one character of the plant only. The competition in mixtures had a greater effect on number of generative shoots and number of grains per head than on grain weight. The results revealed that the yield per plant in mixtures may be even the same as in monoculture, but the relative significance of different yield components may vary. The grain and protein yield of mixtures did not differ significantly from the yield of the highest yielding component grown alone. However, the ratio of actual and expected yield and the relative yield total were in most cases higher than one, indicating that some yield advantage may have been achieved. The genotypic composition of the stand had the greatest influence on the grain protein content of oats.",

    "abstract": "The highly prolific Finnsheep (F) has been exported to more than 40 countries around the world to improve the reproductive performance of local breeds through crossbreeding. The infusion of one-half F into local breeds results in a substantial improvement in all reproductive traits with net reproduction (lambs weaned/ewe mated) being increased by about 25 % in the British Isles and Western Europe and by up to 70—100 % in New Zealand, South Africa and the USA. Heterosis for litter size at birth has been low or negligible in a number of crossbreeding studies involving F. Serious reservations have been expressed about the growth, fleece producton and carcass characteristics of F. While F-cross lambs are usually lighter at birth than local breeds, their weaning and post-weaning weights are often very similar, at least partly due to heterosis. Despite the perceived poor live conformation of purebred F, the carcass weight, quality and composition of F-crosses have been very similar to local breeds or crosses. A striking feature of F-cross carcasses is that they have more kidney and less subcutaneous fat than local breeds. This may be a desirable feature of F-cross in extensive, pastoral farming situations to help sheep survive during droughts or periods of low pasture production. The fleece weight of the purebred F is 30—40 % lower than most local breeds, particularly long-wooled breeds. However, the 1/4-F crosses have consistently been only 5—10 % lower in fleece weight. Studies have reported comparable, or superior, processing qualities of F-cross wool. F-cross ewes have generally been shown to have superior longevity, overall productivity and economic efficiency than local breeds across a diverse range of environments and farming systems. Some of the problems of integrating a highly prolific genotype into extensive, low cost, sheep production systems are discussed. F has been utilized in many countries by producing a new synthetic population containing a certain proportion (1/8 to 1/2) of F ancestry. This approach is usually superior to other crossbreeding options such as stratified crossing or rotational crossing systems.",

The results of the simulations of the springtime nitrate in the root zone showed a reasonably small deviation from the measured values. The coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.56 was significant. The regression equation was y = 4 + 0.66x where the constant term was not significantly different from zero and the slope deviated from zero.

In this study the water from hot spots contained an average of 2.2 mg/l dissolved reactive P but field ditch water 0.14 mg/l. We selected 62 ditches with varying P-load levels for sediment analysis. Five ponds and 16 lakes were also studied. The sediment samples were analysed by the AAAc-extraction (0.5 M ammonium acetate, 0.5 M acetic acid, pH 4.65) method used for routine soil testing in Finland. The analysis of sediment AAAc-P proved to be a useful method for identifying ditches carrying high P waters from hot spots. Half of the ditch sediments in the hot spot ditches showed high or excessive P concentrations. AAAc extraction of the sediment is less expensive than water analysis and the sampling can be extended to periods when no water flows in the ditches.;",

Neither fertilization nor crop rotation had any lasting effect on the level of inorganic nitrogen: the low level observed in the spring before fertilization was found again in the autumn in both a monoculture and a rotation, irrespective of the fertilization level. The clover-grass ley nevertheless had a residual effect on yield, as the average yield over the total trial period was higher in the rotation. Even in the second year after the clover-grass ley, nearly double the quantity of nitrogen was mobilized in unfertilized plots as compared with the monoculture: 36.8 kg/ha and 21.0 kg/ha, respectively. Fertilization resulted in a slight increase in the abundance and activity of microbes. An increasing effect on straw decomposition was found up to the highest level of fertilization. Decomposition was equally effective in monoculture and rotation. At different levels of fertilization (0, 400, 800 and 1200 kg/ ha NPK containing 15% N), an average of 24, 29, 34 and 38 percent of the straw was decomposed during the growing season in the monoculture, and 25, 28, 32 and 37 per cent in the rotation. Carbon dioxide evolved during the growing seasons in unfertilized plots at the rate of 4.3 mmol/m2/h in monoculture and 4.9 mmol/m2/h in rotation. At a fertilizer level of 400 kg/ha the rates were 4.7 and 5.3 mmol/m2/h in monoculture and rotation, respectively. Maximum carbon dioxide was evolved at fertilization levels of 800 and 1200 kg/ha: 5.0 mmol/m2/h the monoculture and 5.8 mmol/m2/h in the rotation. Maximum ATP content and dehydrogenase activity were observed at the fertilization levels of 400 and 800 kg/ha and were slightly greater in the rotation than in the monoculture. Fertilization and crop rotation increased the soil microbial activity and biomass by a few ten per cent. In this trial, favourable conditions for plant growth were also found to favour microbial activity.",

This paper conceptualises an economic approach to protecting plant health against invasive organisms, specifically addressing a multidisciplinary audience involved in plant health research and in governmental policy-making process. We discuss the conceptual framework and present some generally available management options. We also build a basic model dealing with pre-emptive and reactive control, followed by a numerical illustration to the case of Colorado potato beetle in Finland. The analysis undertaken supports the notion that pre-emptive control is a viable strategy. Reactive control should be considered only if very low invasion magnitude combines with a low level of damage. However, the strategy choice implies also distributional impacts that warrant attention. The analysis results in a solution for a given set of numbers only. Uncertainty is incorporated through sensitivity analysis. The approach presented demonstrates the basic economic thinking behind the issue, and the concepts described allow further development of more sophisticated forms of analysis.;",

    "abstract": "A quantitative approach to the determination of the optimum cutting schedule of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) was presented. Optimization was based on a dynamic growth model which included the concepts crop growth rate, development rate and proper growth rate. The proper growth rate measured the growth potential associated with the stages of development in the sward. The crop growth rate of Italian ryegrass was studied at the Arctic Circle Experiment Station during 1973 and 1974. The proper growth rate was determined from primary observations as the derivative of an ordinary logistic curve which passes through origin. The maximum theoretical daily growth of Italian ryegrass was calculated as approx. 300 kg • ha-1• day-1. The optimum cutting schedules using gradient method were sought for Italian ryegrass sward. First, the maximum total dry-matter yield was looked for. Then the maximization was extended to the case, when the yield was weighted with the digestibility of the dry-matter. The maximum yield was obtained when the sward was cut three times, and when the cuttings were concentrated into the latter half of the growing season. The yield of the optimum cutting schedule was not sensitive to small changes in the cutting dates. In the conditions of Finnish Lapland the optimum cutting schedule of Italian ryegrass was: first cut at the end of July, second cut at the end of August and the third cut at the end of September.",

The total content of Ca was lowest in samples of heavy clay, 0.78±0.14 % in the surface soils and 0.92±0.10 % in the deeper layers. The mean content in the groups of other soils was at least about 1.1 %. The total content of Mg increased with an increase in the clay content (r = 0.81***). It ranged from 0.6±0.1 % in the sand and fine sand samples to 1.53±0.19 % in the heavy clay soils of the surface layers and to 1.89±0.12 % in those of the deeper layers. Also in the groups of loam and silt soils and of the coarser clay soils, respectively, the Mg content was in the deeper layers higher than in the surface soils. The total content of K also increased with the clay content (r=0.73***) from 1.7±0.1 % in the sand and fine sand soils to 2.74±0.21 % in the heavy clay soils of the surface layers and to 3.10±0.07 % in those of the deeper layers. The portion of exchangeable Ca was relatively high: in the groups of surface soils from more than one tenth to one third of the total amount. The corresponding average amounts released by even the more drastic treatment with acid were not markedly higher. Only a few per cents of total Mg were exchangeable and slightly higher amounts were dissolved by 0.1 N HCI, whereas the treatment with N HCI at 50° C released about half of the total Mg. Exchangeable K and K dissolved by 0,1 N HCI did not exceed 1 % of the total K, except slightly in the heavy clay soils; the average amounts released by N HCI ranged from 5 to 18 % of the total K.

An application of 0.5 g Mg as MgSO4 ∙ 7 H2O per the 5-liter pots increased slightly the total yield of rye grass shoots and markedly the amount of Mg harvested in the shoots from the sand and fine sand soils with an initial content of only 14 and 37 ppm exchangeable Mg, respectively. No respond to the application of Mg was detected in the silty clay and heavy clay soils which contained exchangeable Mg 226 and 910 ppm, respectively. The muddy clay soil contained 137 ppm exchangeable Mg, and the application of Mg markedly increased the amount of Mg harvested in the shoots, but brought about a decrease in the yield of shoots. The amount of Mg harvested in the shoots without the application of Mg was only in the sand and fine sand soils higher than the original content of exchangeable Mg. Yet, in all soils except in the muddy clay, the decrease in the content of exchangeable Mg during the cropping was lower than the amount of Mg harvested. This was taken to indicate that some release of nonexchangeable Mg did occur during this trial. According to a rough estimation this mobilization of Mg varied from 0 to 60 ppm, whereas the corresponding release of nonexchangeable K was 500–1000 ppm, except in the sand soil. The »exhaustion Mg», or the sum of Mg harvested in the shoots of rye grass and the exchangeable Mg in the soil after cropping, was in all soils of the same order as the amount of Mg extracted by 0.05 N or 0.1 N HCI from the original soil samples.",

Potato dextrose agar (PDA) dishes amended with 0.1 and 1.0 ìg ml-1 prochloraz were used for testing 364 isolates of P. teres based on prelimenary experiment.

The isolates capable of growing on increased concentrations of prochloraz were most commonly isolated from fields, where prochloraz was sprayed during the growing season. Within MTTs experimental field no effect of fungicide application during the growing season was observed on growth of isolates in vitro. Data from this survey was insufficient for making further conclusions regarding the effect of agricultural practices on selection of fungicide tolerant P. teres isolates.

For 19902000 in a complete panel of 138 Finnish farms, almost three fourths of the output growth was linked to input growth. The annual technical change, the shift of the production frontier, was on average 1.4 percent. Technical effi- ciency indicated a slightly decreasing tendency, less than 0.2 percent per year. Harvesting techniques were used as indicators of different technologies. The analysis showed that production frontiers differed between harvesting techniques. The choice of harvesting technique seemed to be related to circumstances on the farm. Thus, overall technical efficiency should not be interpreted as a measure of managerial competence when all the factors are not in the farmers control. Controlling background and production environment related factors yields a considerably lower level of technical inefficiency than the models without the control. It is also shown that in general a more productive harvesting technique may be on average less effi- ciently utilized when compared to its own frontier.;",

A three-year study was conducted in the field to determine the contribution of alterations in canopy structure, tillering and stem elongation among dwarf (D), semidwarf (SD) and tall (T) oat (Avena sativa L.) lines to yield formation. Yield components, leaf characteristics and straw traits were measured from six oat lines (D lines Pal and Grane, SD lines Hja 76416 and Salo, and T lines Veli and Jalostettu maatiainen) separately on the main shoot and tillers. Results indicated that long leaf area duration and high leaf area index were associated with increased grain yield probably due to more persistent and active assimilation. Also, higher number of leaves increased the grain yield. Higher peduncle, straw and node weights associating with increased grain yield may result from more abundant assimilate reserves; however, the longer the straw and peduncle, the lower the grain yield, which may result from increased lodging of SD and T lines. The traits contributing most to the grain yield varied greatly from year to year. It is concluded that no single dominant trait determined grain yield, since yield is a product of several different traits. SD lines seemed to be most promising for further breeding programs on the basis of their growth pattern and yielding ability.;",

In addition, two data sets were prepared to assess the effect of excluding (Data I) or including (Data II) records of culled cows on estimates of genetic parameters. Sire variances and heritabilities were larger using Data II. When data from longer intervals was used heritabilities of CM were slightly higher than shorter intervals indicating that longer intervals tend to obscure genetic variation between animals. Of all CM traits, heritability of liability to CM with threshold-liability model was highest for CM2 (h2=0.083) implying that most of the genetic information on CM is in early lactation. In sire evaluation, a multitrait index calculated by combining CM2, CM4 and CM5 had the highest correlation with all other univariate CM trait evaluations. This and the magnitude (less than 1.0) of genetic correlations between CM traits suggest that a multitrait model considering CM from the different risk periods would be appropriate for CM sire evaluation.;",

In this paper, studies carried out on enhanced resistance to viruses and tolerance of cold stress in potato, genetic modification of flower pigmentation and morphology in gerbera, production of edible vaccines in transgenic barley seeds, and expression of heterologous proteins for pharmaceutical purposes from vector viruses were chosen to exemplify the general utility of biotechnological approaches and also how plant biotechnology research has developed on cultivated plants at University of Helsinki. The studies reveal cellular and genetic mechanisms and provide scientific information that can be used for widening the uses of crop plants. They can also be used to detect any putative risks associated with the use of the biotechnological application in agriculture and horticulture and to develop practises which reduce any inadvertent negative consequences that plant production may have to the environment.;",

Results indicate that no contract model provided seed potato producers with average positive net profits, and profitability ratios for seed potato farms stayed below one. The results indicate that seed potato producers trading on a fixed-price and pre-emptive market could sell their seed potato for 13 per cent less than on a transaction market, but with equal net profits. The more consistent supply chain leads to less market uncertainty. If the food potato producer was not party to the contract, there was no marked decrease in market uncertainty. With contract production the needs of contract parties could be controlled, but it will be up to the objectives of the party offering the contract, which party in the potato chain most benefits from the contract production.;",

The population structure was studied by computing the inbreeding coefficients, breed differentiation and relationships were investigated with random drift-based measures and a factorial correspondence analysis. In addition, a neighbour-joining tree was drawn summarising allele sharing distances for 195 individuals of the Estonian breeds, Western Finncattle, and Danish Jersey. The Estonian breeds displayed generally similar levels of within-population diversity. Depending on the set of markers used 6.2 or 4.3% of the total genetic variation can be explained by differences among the breeds. Construction of the tree for individuals revealed a distinctive pattern of grouping for Estonian Holstein, Estonian Red and Danish Jersey, but Estonian Native and Western Finncattle appeared on the same branches. This indicates that the gene pool of Estonian Native largely overlaps with that of Western Finncattle. However, our genetic marker analysis shows that the three Estonian breeds are genetically differentiated, suggesting that the current gene pool of Estonian dairy cattle is diverse.;",

    "abstract": "Animal size has increased considerably in the Finnish blue fox population. This has been achieved by intensive selection. An efficient breeding scheme may increase inbreeding. The rate of inbreeding by generation was estimated to be from 0.107% to 0.191% depending on the considered years. Annual rate of inbreeding was estimated to be from 0.059% to 0.100% depending on the considered years. Effective population size was estimated to be at least 260. Thus, inbreeding seems not a major problem in the Finnish blue fox population. However, some of the best breeding farms in terms of estimated genetic level in animal size have the highest average inbreeding coefficient, as well. Advanced tools to restrict increase in coefficient of inbreeding may be needed in the future, and in some farms already.;",

The type of soil ranged from finesand to heavy clay, the soil reaction from pH 3.3 to pH 6.4 (in 0.01 M CaCl2), and the total potassium content from 1.99 to 3.41 per cent. The fixation against an extraction with neutral ammonium acetate distinctly depended on the conditions used for the application of potassium: on the average, without drying the samples fixed during one hour somewhat more than 80 per cent of the amount fixed during 18 hours, when the samples were treated with KCI-solutions corresponding to 2.5 me K/100 g soil. Drying the suspension at 80°C resulted in a fixation 1.2 to 4.1 times as high as that under the »wet» conditions within one hour. The results of these two methods were not particularly closely correlated (r = 0.73***). The results of the »dry» method were found to be of the same order as the fixation of potassium in samples incubated for three months at room temperature. The results of the »dry» fixation were positively correlated with the pH (r = 0.75***) and negatively correlated with the contents of organic carbon (r = —0.63***) and exchangeable potassium (r = —0.40*), but they were not correlated with the contents of clay or the acid soluble potassium. Under the »wet» conditions the relative fixation generally decreased with an increase in the application of potassium, but there were samples which fixed a rather low but almost equal portion of all the applications from 0.625 to 40 me K/100 g soil. The fixation from the highest addition was correlated with the clay fraction",

    "abstract": "A comparative study has been made with a view to clarification of the quality properties of some home-grown black-currant varieties. Twelve varieties were examined; samples were obtained from 6 different localities, of which the southernmost was Piikkiö, and the northernmost Rovaniemi, over a period of three years. The analytical results were compared with the totals of heat, the totals of hours of sunshine, and the precipitaition during the years concerned. Ascorbic acid, one of the most important criteria of quality, was assayed by application of the method of Robinson &amp; Stotz, slightly modified. On the basis of the results obtained, mutual comparison of the varieties studied is possible along with consideration of the possible effects of weather conditions and the degree of north latitude of the place of growth. It is well known that the ascorbic acid content is dependent upon the variety. Accordingly, the following diminishing sequence was found in the ascorbic acid content of the varieties studied: Boskoop, Roodknop, Westwick Choice, Wellington XXX, Gerby, Wellington X, Åström, Brödtorp, Goliath, Silvergieter, Janslunda and Black of Lepaa. In this series, the amount of ascorbic acid fell from 250 to 127 mg/100g; considerable variations occurred in each variety. As for weather conditions, the summer temperature showed the greatest effect; in general, low temperature increased the amount of ascorbic acid. However, Brödtorp and Black of Lepaa often formed an exception. The number of hours of sunshine produced a similar effect, but to a lesser degree; by contrast, precipitation evinced no clear-cut effect. The degree of north latitude of the locality also seems to exert some effect, probably mainly because a latitude further north means a lowering of the temperature, and consequent retardation of the ripening, which again causes higher ascorbic acid values. Comparison with published reports shows that in principle the present results are in line with those presented earlier. The differences might be attributable to different methods of assay, or variability in the varieties concerned. The northern latitude of the place of growth and the degree of maturity may be of importance.",

The experiment was conducted using 80 dairy bulls which were fed total mixed rations ad libitum. The rations included grass silage (500 g kg-1 DM) and concentrate (500 g kg-1 DM). Four different experimental concentrate mixtures included rye at 0, 150, 300 and 450 g kg-1 DM. The average daily DM and metabolisable energy intakes of the bulls were 10.9 kg d-1 and 127 MJ d-1, respectively. There were no differences in DM, energy or nutrient intakes among the treatments. The average live weight gain and carcass gain of the bulls were 1543 and 832 g d-1, respectively, and rye inclusion had no effects on growth. There were no significant differences in feed conversion or carcass characteristics among the treatments. It can be concluded that rye grain is a suitable energy supplement with good quality silage for growing dairy bulls.",

Significant differences between varieties were found according to the panicle length, number of the branches and 1000-seed weight depending on the year of utilization as well as with reference to evaluated seed traits, irrespectively on year and row spacing. The results showed that the main traits determining the seed weight per panicle of Dactylis glomerata varieties are the panicle length and the number of the 1st order branches.

Mulches’ effect on liverwort control continued for two years on highbush blueberry and blackcurrant, and one year on rhododendron. The blackcurrant stem pieces trial continued for one year. Blueberry and rhododendron demand acidic growing media, creating an acute need for liverwort control. Sieved moss was used in two different layers on top of a pot. The prevention rate of liverwort growth in blueberry in July–August was 95–99%, and in October 78–90%, depending on weather conditions; in rhododendron and blackcurrant, it was 90–95%. The control effect was diminished in more decomposed moss. No significant difference between thickness and coarseness of moss mulch layers was observed.

The fruitful meeting, well organized by Priit Tammeorg, offered a broad kaleidoscope of new insights into the novel interdisciplinary research topic of biochar. The papers in this issue clearly show that biochar use in agriculture can deliver benefits such as reductions in N2O emissions or N leaching (Kettunen and Saarnio), in addition to soil C storage without negative effects (Karer et al. , Anders et al. ). However, they also demonstrate that just one biochar addition does not turn each temperate fertile soil into a fertility miracle. In Terra preta sites, the pyrogenic carbon was likely an important ingredient, but it was combined with organic waste inputs and not used pure. Thus, yield-increasing pure-biochar effects in temperate soils are likely not a low-hanging fruit to be harvested without further ado. Rather, problematic soils should be the primary target; combined biochar-organics usage also deserves further research. However, considering the lack of political efforts to restore our planet's radiative balance, or tackle the challenges associated with soil degradation and resource consumption, no emerging chances should be missed. \"Biochar\" is such a chance – not more, but also not less. Shaping \"biochar use in agriculture\" into a safe, sustainable and economically feasible tool will only come at the cost of good hard research efforts; but it offers the unique chance to turn agricultural practices from being part of the problem into being part of the solution.",

    "abstract": "The present investigation is an account of the results from two fertilizing experiments established on Sphagnum bog at the Experimental Station of Leteensuo. The experiments were carried out in 1923 and 1934. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results. Most important in significance among the different nutrients is nitrogen, phosphorus ranging next, and potassium last. Potassium could even cause a reduction in the crop yields. The effect of liming was evident in the form of increased hay crops, whereas the grain yields of oats were reduced by it. Liming has improved the effect of phosphorus particularly in the case of hay. The results also seem to indicate that the relation between potassium and calcium has significance in regard to the reduction of crop yield caused by potassium. Remarkable crop yield increases were obtained by nitrogen fertilizing. The hay crops and the grain and straw crops of oats increased almost linearly with the addition of nitrogen, in the form of calcium nitrate, in quantities up to 90 kg N per hectare. Quantities in excess of this caused hardly any further increase in the crops. The said quantity is suitable for cover manuring of hay meadows, but the most advisable quantity for cereals is thought to be 45—60 kg N per hectare, so that lodging of the crops might be avoided. Nitrogen fertilization does not essentially affect the quality of the grain crops of cereals; on the other hand nitrogen promoted the retention of timothy in the meadow when nitrogen was used in quantities up to 90 kg per hectare. Stable manure increased the crops. This effect was most distinctly evident in the grain and straw crops of oats. The effect of stable manure was still present 15 years after the most recent addition of stable manure.",

It was found by various methods that the samples from the plots of the higher treatments were able to sorb more phosphate than were the samples from the untreated plots and the soil with the lowest phosphate application. The higher content of iron and aluminum in the soils of the higher treatments probably accounts for their higher capacity to retain phosphate. It is possible that in clayed peat soil the higher content of exchangeable calcium and the lower acidity of the samples of the higher treatments are able to increase the effect of aluminum. The factors which are responsible for the differences in the iron and aluminum contents of the variously treated plots are discussed. It is unlikely that these results would be of importance under practical conditions.",

Although the major principles and means of the CAP and the Finnish agricultural policy are quite similar, Finnish agriculture would face fundamental adjustment needs primarily due to the high level of domestic prices and costs. The key factor in the adaptation process would be the overall structural adjustment in terms of production costs, development of farm size, internal and external comparative advantage, and regional reallocation of resources. The length of run analysis, especially w.r.t. to capital requirements, is decisive. Major disadvantages of the Finnish agriculture are unfavourable climate and farm structure. The study indicates that cereal production in particular suffers from the disadvantages through high unit costs of production. Milk production has better capabilities to adjust in European integration, but not without problems, either.",

The varieties tested were the domestic ‘Aino’ and the Dutch ‘Belinka’ and ‘Natasha’. Increasing the nitrogen supply from 6 kg/ha to 30 kg/ha inproved stalk yield significantly. The effect of the largest nitrogen dose on stalk yield was dependent on growth regulator treatment and weather conditions. Growth regulator treatment increased stalk yield when the nitrogen supply was further increased from 30 kg/ha to 60 kg/ha. On the untreated stand, the effect of nitrogen fertilization was less strong. Increasing nitrogen supply from 6 kg/ha to 60 kg/ha increased branching of the stalk, crop height, technical length and thickness of stalk, lodging, 1000 seed weight and protein content. The average stalk yield at both experimental sites was 4110 kg DM/ha. In the wet and cool growing season of 1987, growth regulator treatment significantly reduced stalk length, lodging and seed yield but increased stalk yield. In the dry growing season of 1989, growth regulator treatment increased stalk length, too. The domestic variety, ‘Aino’, was the earliest but it lodged easily. Its stalk yield was the lowest, on average 3400 kg of DM/ha. There was no difference between the Dutch varieties, ‘Belinka’ and ‘Natasha’, both of which are suitable for growing in Finland.",

In the first season when the overall performance of the crops was poor and the numbers of the main pest Rhopalosiphum padi (Horn., Aphididae) on oats low, the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) index indicated an intercropping advantage in the bean yield and a disadvantage in the oat yield, the insecticide treatment having no effect on the overall nor on the relative performance of the component crops. The site used during the second season was of high fertility, thus favouring oats over beans. The LERs indicated no advantage or disadvantage in mixed cropping for either oats or beans when R. padi was not controlled. Spraying against R. padi improved the performance of oats, the mixture with 1/3 oats showing an advantage over the monocrop. Simultaneously, there were signs (p = 0.08) of a reduction in the relative performance of the beans. The indicative results support the hypothesis of interspecific dynamics in compensatory yielding as an element of improved reliability in intercropping. The yield components most sensitive to the change in cropping pattern were the number of panicles per plant in oats and the seed weight in beans, both increasing in the mixtures. Compared to known responses to stand density in monocrops, the beans responded to the mixed cropping in a more specific way than the oats. Mixed cropping increased the numbers of aphids in oats. There were signs of a reduced incidence, but not of a reduced average colony size, of Aphis fabae, and of a reduced rate of notching by Sitona spp. weevils on beans in mixed cropping. The results for damage by the frit fly (Oscinella frit) were inconclusive.",

This paper reviews PDR approaches to Potato virus Y (PVY, type member of the genus Potyvirus). PDR to viruses operates often through RNA-mediated resistance mechanisms that do not require protein expression. Studies on the RNA-mediated resistance have led to the discovery of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), a mechanism that controls gene expression in eukaryotic cells and provides natural protection against virus infections. Viruses, in turn, can suppress the PTGS with some of their proteins, such as the helper component-proteinase protein of PVY. Expression of PVY proteins in transgenic plants entails a risk for heterologous encapsidation or synergism with viruses that infect the PVY-resistant transgenic plant. These risks are avoided using RNA-mediated resistance, but a risk still exists for recombination between the transgene transcript and the RNA genome of the infecting virus, which may create a virus with altered properties. The harmful consequences can be limited to some extent by removing functional motifs from the viral sequence used as a transgene.;",

The estimates of the effective CEC were highly correlated and dependent on the clay and organic carbon content and pH(CaCl2) of the soil, the coefficient of multiple determination being over 80 %. Exchangeable Ca was the dominating cation. The proportion of Ca of the effective CEC was about 80 %. Acid ammonium acetate-extractable Ca together with pH(H2O) explained over 80 % of the variation in the effective CEC. For the whole material consisting of mineral soils with great variations in texture, organic carbon content and properties under evaluation, the regression equation predicting the effective CEC (KCI method) was CEC (mval/kg) = 309—56.8pH(H2O) + 0.085Ca(mg/l). Only 16 % of the estimates of the effective CEC calculated with this regression equation deviated more than 15 % from the measured values.",

The rise in temperature makes emergence faster with in the range of minimum temperature (3.1°C for wheat and 1.9°C for barley) and the temperature where growth begins to slow down(about 31°C for wheat and 27°C for barley).The optimum range for 50 % emergence was obtained at a matric pressure range of pF 1.3—2.7 or —5.0— —0.20 m (water column) at a temperature of 10°C, which quite well corresponds to the situation in Finland during the emergence period in spring. A clear increase can be observed in the required heat sum for wheat and barley when the soil water potential reaches a critical point which was pF 2.8 or—6.3m for wheat and pF 2.7 or —5.0 m for barley. The total emergence as a function of matric potential for wheat and barley was determined over a period of 30 days at 10°C. In the wet side, pF 1,0 can be considered a limit, the total emergence decreasing with lower values. In the dry side, a corresponding decrease can be noticed in total emergence at pF above 3.0. The water uptake by seeds speeded up with increasing temperature from 10 to 25°C. Radicles of wheat and barley began to appear when the water uptake by the seed was approximately 50—60 % of the initial weight of the seed. The initial water uptake caused by the moistening of the pericarp due to capillarity was about 3 % for wheat and 5 % for barley at a soil water potential of pF 1.2.",

    "abstract": "Phytoalexins in potato are sesquiterpenoid substances produced in response to infections and are believed to help plants resist attack by pathogens. However, these compounds appear in response to compatible as well as incompatible interactions and only accumulate in the tubers. The amounts of phytoalexins produced depend on the physiological condition of the tubers. Young tubers don’t get easily infected with Phytophthora infestans even though they synthesize extremely small amounts of phytoalexins. Furthermore, confusion as to the identity of specific races and the propensity for a given race to produce different effects in the same type of host makes it extremely difficult to predict host-parasite interactions with any acceptable degree of accuracy. It is doubtful that the production of phytoalexins in response to artificial inoculations is representative of that occurring in natural infections. Markedly different types of pathogens induce synthesis of same substances in the host cells. It therefore seems most probable that all the phytoalexins are synthesized in response to stimulation by an endogenous elicitor. Little knowledge is available regarding the biosynthesis of these sesquiterpenes, and many previous determinations have presumably been erroneous. When potato tubers were inoculated with the late blight fungus, secondarily appearing bacteria were not retarded, despite the presence of phytoalexins. There is no generally accepted hypothesis describing the mechanism by which phytoalexins inhibit pathogens and no distinction has been made between the effects on necrotrophs and biotrophs. Adequate bioassays capable of measuring the effects of inhibition have yet to be developed, thus far, no convincing inhibitory effects have been reported. During purification of the phytoalexins there is a high risk for artifact forming, implying that specific compounds cannot be detected with certainty. Moreover, present analytical methods must be improved before we can determine how phytoalexins act in vivo. Probably, phytoalexins are synthesized at a stage in the infection too late to be able to restrict its expansion with the tissues of the host. Phytoalexins are restricted to the attacked parts of the tubers and there is no evidence indicating that these compounds pose any health risks when present in potatoes used for consumption.",

In field studies of cultivated and natural stands it was observed that the pollinators (bumble bees and honey bees) foraged optimally, i.e., flight was towards the nearest flower. Therefore, in cultivation the plants should be planted so that the nearest neighbours belong to different clones. In general, the pollinators preferred white clover (Trifolium repens), growing as a weed, and cultivated strawberry as opposed to the arctic bramble. These plants appeared to be severe competitors for the pollinators, and care should therefore be taken to reduce their influence.",

Chopped red clover and timothy were mixed during ensiling and preserved with AIV II solution (80 % formic acid and 2 % orthophosphoric acid), applied at the rate of 6 l/1000kg fresh material. The timothy sward was fertilized with 100kg N/ha and the red clover with 15kg N/ha. The dry matter content in red clover was 14.5 % and in timothy 18.6%, and the crude protein content of DM 22.9 % and 11.5 %, respectively. True protein formed 75—76 % of crude protein in both herbages and the proportion of watersoluble N in total N was 32 % in red clover and 36 % in timothy. The rumen degradability of protein during the first two hours was under 10 % in both herbages; after 18 and 24h ours it was 76 % and 87 % in red clover, and 65 % and 70 % in timothy. In red clover the contents of lysine, methionine and cysteine were 5.7 g, 0.4 g and 0.9 g/16 g N, respectively, the corresponding values for timothy being 4.8 g, 0.7 g and 1.4g/16 g N. In red clover the content of water-soluble carbohydrates was 10.6 % of DM and in timothy 16.5 %; the contents of plant acids were 6.7 % and 3.5 % of DM, respectively. Red clover contained 10.9g Ca/kg DM and timothy 3.1 g Ca. The total amount of inorganic constituents was also higher in red clover than in timothy. Although the chemical composition of red clover was less suitable for ensiling than the composition of timothy, the quality of all the silages was good. During ensiling the decrease in the proportion of true protein in crude protein and the increase in the proportion of watersoluble N in total N were smaller in red clover than in timothy silage. These changes were reflected in the ruminal protein degradation, which seemed to be slower when they were small. The amino acid profile of the protein did not alter during ensiling. The ensiling losses were higher in the silages containing red clover than in the timothy silage. This conserned especially the effluent losses and surface spoilage of the feed.",

Based on production function analysis, different Cobb-Douglas and linear models are specified and estimated. A variable for the research input is measured through the flow of public expenditures for research and university-level education in 1950—1984. In addition, a stock of research capital consisting of funds accumulated since 1920 is constructed and included in the models. The estimates of elasticity with respect to public research are used to compute rates of return. State expenditures for extension agencies are also taken into account on the cost side. It is concluded that the stock of research capital estimates are more believable than the flow estimates, because of difficulties in identifying an appropriate lag. Based on the stock estimates, the value marginal product for public research during the period studied seems to have been 1.83—1.91. The conclusion implies that additional public investment in agricultural research would have annually returned by 183—191 % over the inflation rate. The marginal internal rate of return for public research is calculated to have been 20—62 % depending on the length of the lag (4—10 years).",

Eleven Finnish agamospecies were compared with two middle-European varieties, ’Vollherziger, verbesserter’ and ’Vertde Montmagny’in regard to preferred methods of cultivation as well as to yield level and quality properties. Further, suitability and effects of the culturing methods were studied, the main variables being level of fertilization and use of various coverings to bleach the rosettes. Of the cultivation properties, particularly the earliness, flowering, winter hardiness, vigour of growth and resistance against diseases and pests were considered. The yields in spring varied between about 50 and 150 kg/are. When growth was in light the bitterness of all the agamospecies and varieties studied was only slight and when effective covering was used bitterness was in significant. The sensory quality varied somewhat depending on the agamospecies or variety and method of cultivation, being at best very good and at worst satisfactory. In the conditions studied, the higher level of fertilization was too high. The single black film, the black fibre cloth and thick bark humus layer were all suitable coverings. Though they decreased the yield (at least when calculated as dry matter), the coverings improved the taste and texture of the rosettes. With film and fibre cloth, rosettes were somewhat more greenish and yields better than with bark humus. The humus also made the rosettes more succulent and crisp, so that the texture was improved. This method is laborious, however, and better suited for home gardening than commercial cultivation. Of the agamospecies and varieties studied, the best for cultivation in light were Taraxacum hemicyclum, T. lanyphyllum, ’Vollherziger verbesserter’ and ’Vert de Montmagny. For cultivation under covering the best were ’Vert de Montmagny’, T. hemicyclum and T. pallidipes.",

Based on the assumption that these soil stresses increase endogenous ethylene production in plants, changes indicating higher construction costs for roots, such as decreased specific root length, were expected. The hypothesis was found to be only partly correct. Most morphological changes of barley roots were probably a reaction to increased soil mechanical impedance. Examples of this are root width, which was increased by compaction apart from in wet soil, as well as increased width and specific volume, and a decreased specific length of roots in the deepest layer of well-aerated loose soil. However, in loose moist soil hypoxia prevented root growth, but did not change root morphology. The results suggest that severe hypoxia lessens the possibilities of roots to adapt to the hypoxic soil by reducing root growth and by preventing the formation of aerenchyma. ;",

From small seed the early development of the haulms was slower, the number of stems smaller, the weight of the haulms and roots smaller. The number of tubers per hill was lower but the number of tubers per stem higher. Average yield per seed tuber was 16 per cent smaller. Small seed produced a slightly higher starch content and a lower percentage of blight infected tubers. Plants from large seed tubers developed faster and the weight of their haulms and roots declined more in the autumn. In the early liftings also the tuber yield per hill was distinctly larger than from small seed, but in the case of the earlier cultivar Barima the difference was fully levelled out by the autumn. Chitting made the early growth faster, decreased the number of stems, reduced the weight of the haulms and roots and decreased the number of tubers per hill. The average increases of yield and starch content were not significant but were dependent on cultivar and lifting time. When chitting was employed the amount of large tubers increased and scab infection decreased. In many respects Amyla and Barima reacted differently both to seed tuber size and to chitting.",

The following results were noted: Samples dried in a vacuum at 40°C yielded the same results as those treated by freeze drying. No attention need be paid to the sample thickness. From the technical point of view, vacuum drying is preferable to freeze drying. Oven-drying gave good results when the following technique was used: The herbage sample is first heated as a thin layer at 100°C for 30—60 min., depending on the water content. Final drying is carried out at 50°C. The conventional drying temperature, 65 °C, is too high. The thin-layer drying technique causes errors in the sugar content, the thick-layer drying also in the figures for lignin and crude fibre. Between 50 and 100°C, the thickness of the sample layer induces in many wet samples a larger error than does the high temperature. Different materials react to heat-drying in different ways. The major factors are the water content and the composition of the dry matter. The drying method does not affect the data for the crude protein, as determined by the Kjeldahl method. The following facts were noted for the pure mixtures; A high temperature is sufficient to cause sugar losses; proteins are not necessary. A reaction between carbohydrates and amino acids brings about the drying error in the lignin and crude fibre results. High temperature and high water content magnifies the error. Application of a protein correction for the crude lignin eliminates only a part of the error introduced.",

    "abstract": "Soil samples were analysed from a long-term liming trial (38 years) and a fertilizing trial (36 years) on woody sedge peat soils at Tohmajärvi Experimental Station in eastern Finland. Five applications of 4000 or 6000 kg/ha of ground limestone increased the soil pH from 4.4 to 4.8 or 5.0, respectively. The cation exchange capacity was increased from 72 me/100 g to 76 or 80 me/100 g, and the base saturation from 43 per cent to 56 or 61 per cent, respectively, if the exchangeable cations were extracted by ammonium acetate at pH 7. The relative increases in the cation exchange capacity and base saturation percentage were even higher when determined by the method of Teräsvuori. The contents of exchangeable calcium and magnesium were increased and that of potassium decreased by liming. A lower application of lime, five times 2000 kg/ha, did not cause statistically significant changes. Owing to the large variation no significant effect of liming on the content of organic phosphorus or of various fractions of inorganic phosphorus in this soil could be detected. Liming did not increase the total amount of mineral nitrogen extracted by K2SO4-solution from the samples incubated under the labotatory conditions, but the highest application enhanced nitrification. Annual applications of 22 kg P/ha as superphosphate, 66 kg K/ha as 40 % or 50 % potassium fertilizer, and 15 kg N/ha as calcium nitrate alone or in any combination did not change the acidity or the cation exchange capacity of the soil in the fertilizing trial. The application of superphosphate was detectable as higher Bray 1 test values and higher contents of inorganic phosphorus in various fractions. The content of exchangeable potassium was about 0.2 me/100 g in plots N, P, and NP, about 0.3 me/100 g in plots PK and NPK, and more than 0.5 me/100 g in plots K and NK. This is well in accordance with the significant response in yields produced by phosphate in this trial. The accumulation of mineral nitrogen in the samples incubated under the laboratory conditions was highest in soil from plots K and NK, and lowest in soil from the plots PK and P.",

    "abstract": "Release of nonexchangeable potassium by treatment with 1 N HCI at 50°C was studied on basis of a material consisting of 330 samples of Finnish mineral soils. The results ranged from 1 to 830mg K/100g. The mean content of nonexchangeable acid-soluble potassium was in the surface samples of sand and fine sand soils 95±26 mg/100 g, in loam soils 165±31 mg/100 g, in silt soils 195±52 mg/100 g, in clay loam soils 258±32 mg/100 g, in silty clay soils 283±43 mg/100 g, and in heavy clay soils 345±126 mg/100 g. In the subsoil samples of loam, clay loam, silty clay and heavy clay soils the mean content was significantly higher than in the surface samples, or 283±51 mg/100 g, 404±56 mg/100 g, 535±53 mg/100 g, and 580±37 mg/100 g, respectively. The results seem to be high as compared with data reported from Sweden, Norway and Germany. The content of nonexchangeable potassium released by acid was to some extent connected with the clay content: the correlation coefficient in the whole material was r = 0.74***, but only about 0.5*** both in the separate groups of the 178 nonclay samples and the 152 clay samples. There was only a very low correlation between the contents of nonexchangeable acid-soluble potassium and readily exchangeable potassium. A somewhat higher correlation, r = 0.65***, was found for the relationship between the former and fixation of added potassium under »wet» conditions, but it was markedly decreased by the elimination of the effect of the clay content. Nonexchangeable acid-soluble potassium usually represented a lower part of the total potassium in the surface samples than in the subsoil samples, and also the proportion tended to be higher in the clay soils than in the coarser soils. It varied from 0.2 to 26.3 per cent in the small material studied. In most cultivated soils less nonexchangeable potassium was released from the samples of plough layer than from samples of deeper layers. In a podsol profile the minimum content of nonexchangeable and exchangeable potassium and the maximum of fixation of added potassium was found in the A2 horizon; in a brown podsolic soil all these test values decreased fairly regularly with depth. From some silt and silty clay soils incubated for three months at room temperature a large part, even more than 40 per cent of the added potassium was not recovered by the acid extraction. Ammonium acetate extracted from 9 to 85 per cent of the potassium applied before incubation, and the part of added potassium found as nonexchangeable acid-soluble form varied from 5 to 53 per cent. The equilibrium between the different potassium fractions in soil was discussed. It was supposed that differences in the ability of plants to utilize nonexchangeable potassium may partly depend on the level to which plant roots are able to decrease potassium concentration in the solution around the minerals.",

In addition, the impact of environmental factors on the occurrence of the most common neophytes (alien species introduced after the 17th century) and the impact of neophytes on native species diversity were studied. In total, 37 neophyte species were detected, but neophytes regarded as highly invasive were rare and occasional. We detected spatio-temporal variation in the invasion level, but it changed according to the measure used. For instance, alien species diversity was lower in south-western Finland than in other years in 2005, and the relative alien species richness was highest in southern and lowest in eastern Finland. Preferences for environmental conditions (disturbance, habitat type and geographical location) and the impact on plant diversity varied among the most common neophytes. The most common neophytes were positively rather than negatively associated with native and alien species diversity. The results suggest that alien species management and control methods should be species-specific and considered case-by-case. Neophytes do not yet cause severe problems, but regular monitoring is needed to detect changes in their invasion levels.",

    "abstract": "Clay and sand, used as soil improving agents, have increased the hay crops as well as the cereal crops. When the fertilization contained phosphates only, the increases in crop yield produced by the soil improvement were quite high. In this case clay developed a higher effect than sand. In connection with phosphate plus potassium fertilization both kinds of mineral soil were approximately equal in value, but their effect fell considerably below that of phosphate fertilization alone. These agents have thus a remarkable potassium fertilizing effect. However, potassium fertilization was not able to account for the entire crop yield-increasing effect of mineral soil. The highest increases in crop yield per unit of mineral soil addition were obtained with the mineral soil quantity of 100 m3 per hectare. The addition of mineral soil has a prolonged effect since the effect has not decreased in the 30 years since the latest soil improving treatment in this test. Phosphate and potassium fertilization are both necessary. For spring cereals and for the annual top dress fertilization of hay meadows the superphosphate quantity of 200—300 kg per hectare is adequate. The requirement of potassium fertilizer varies according to the quantity of soil improving agents and their quality. In all circumstances 200 kg 50 % potassium salt per hectare seems to be a sufficient potassium fertilization for the plants considered in this test. A slightly higher quantity is thought to be necessary for the top dress fertilization of hay meadows without soil improving agents.",

On the contrary, no special effect of the unbroken day, which would suffice to compensate the shortness of the period of growth, has been established from the appearance of the peak yields at the different latitudes in Finland.",

Esimerkkinä siitä nopeudesta, jolla syysrypsin siementen vesipitoisuus saattaa muuttua jo yhden vuorokauden kuluessa, mainittakoon, että jos on ollut tavallista kuivempaa, niin että vesipitoisuus on laskenut 7 %:iin ja tämän jälkeen suhteellinen kosteus nousee 100 %:iin, muuttuu siementen vesipitoisuus lämpötilan ollessa 20° C jo yhden vuorokauden kuluessa 10.4 %:iin 20—40° C:ssa eivät syysrypsin siemenet paljoakaan ota eivätkä luovuta vettä suhteellisen kosteuden pysyessä muuttumattomana. Lämpötilan laskiessa 4° C:een niiden vesipitoisuus kuitenkin selvästi kasvaa. Vesipitoisuuden noustua 10—12 %:iin kasvaa siementen vesipitoisuus suhteellisesti nopeammin ilman suhteellisen kosteuden edelleen kasvaessa.

    "abstract": "In Finland the underdrainage of fields has been of small importance, although the need of draining the soil is great. The weightiest reason for this are the high costs of underdrainage which for ex. in 1950 made on an average 60.000 mks per hectare. The costs depend principally on the lenght of drains per hectare, which in Finland is principally considered to be dependent on the kind of soil. Table No. 1 shows the costs of drainage and the number of drains per hectare, in different soils. Besides the costs also technical restrictions have been an impediment to the advance of drainage in our country. Among other things the production of tile-pipes is quite insufficient. The costs of drainage in heavy clay are divided according to table No. 2. Examinations as to the possibilities of reducing in some respect the said costs have resulted in the conclusion that these possibilities are very small at the most expensive point, viz. the tile- pipes 45%. The greatest saving possibilities are to be found in the digging costs. Big digging machines may not have a decisive influence on the question in Finland, this fact being due to the high rate of interest and the scarcity of capital. It would be desirable to develop inexpensive digging machines for underdrainage, because in Finland the season suitable for drainage is very short. A great obstacle in this respect is, however, the fact that the demands for depth of the drains now in force in Finland are so great —in South-Finland the digging depth is 125 and in North Finland 145 cm. In the article the possibilities of reducing the depth of the drains are examined, and according to the experiences and researches made in Sweden, such possibilities could be imagined. In order to further a rapid advance of underdrainage in Finland cheaper methods of drainage than the tile and the board drainage now in use ought to be adopted. Also the possibilities offered by the hills as well as the old plot-trenches ought to be observed and made use of. The author presents a new method which he has tested in mineral soils. A small channel filled with sifted gravel or macadam is made at the bottom of old plot-trenches. The ability of such a channel to conduct water can be exactly estimated (picture No. 13) and so the quantity of gravel or macadam and the grain size can be made dependent on the quantity of water to be conducted. Across such trenches will be made tile-drains at a distance of 50—100 m from each other. By this method the costs can be reduced to about 50 % of the present costs. The gravel or the macadam will be safeguarded against silting up by peat or moss. In peat soil the author has experimented with the arch-drain shown in picture No. 16, which is also made at the bottom of an old trench. Special shovels have been developed for the preparation of this kind of drains. Although the duration of such drains is shorter than the duration of the woodpipe drains, they are to be recommended, at least in certain kinds of peat soil, on account of their cheapness. Besides, although the conducting material would be resistant, the sinking of the peatlands (see picture No. 17) will set a limit to the duration of the wood pipe drainage, because the deep-dug drains will, at the beginning, reduce the crops. Finally the article contains economical comparisons between the expensive and the cheap method.",

The data consisted of 38 679 first lactation test-day milk yields of 4205 cows from 231 herds in three geographical regions (North Savo, Central Ostrobothnia and Lapland). To identify different test days, records were numbered according to the days in milk after calving, and were further categorized into three part-lactations according to the test-day classification. Expressions in the three part-lactations were considered as separate traits, and tests were treated as repeated observations within the trait. Heritability estimates for test-day milk yield varied between 0.11 and 0.17, being lowest at the beginning of lactation. Genetic correlations between test-day milk yields at different trimesters ranged from 0.64 to 0.91, being highest between consecutive trimesters. Standard errors of the estimates of genetic parameters varied between 0.02 and 0.08. Genetic interrelationships differed from 1.0, supporting the assumption that genetic variation exists in the shape of the lactation curve. The necessity of considering deviations from the general lactation curve in the test-day model, e.g. fitting random regression coefficients, is discussed.",

Platform use was found to be lowest during the coldest part of the year (winter, late autumn) and highest in mid-summer (July). The seasonal pattern in platform use obtained by the scan samplings was in agreement with that obtained by video recordings. Platform use was sex-related being significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher in females than males. Circadian distribution of platform use was rather similar for both sexes. Hourly use was highest from 4 to 5 a.m. and lowest at about 8-9 a.m. when farm work started. Platforms were mostly used for sleeping and the least for jumping. The animals’ needs for rest, observation and seclusion required by the European Convention were met fairly well by the presently studied platform type. This is demonstrated by of its rather high amount of general use, and because it functioned appropriately as a place for observation and rest. Based on the present data, wooden U-type platforms can be recommended for practical farming purposes, particularly outside the winter period.",

In the first experiment, the adsorption of V, Mo and W by soil and the desorption of P were measured at the soils’ natural pH after an equilibration time of 3, 5, 22, 29, 46 and 70 h.

During the first few hours, the presence of molybdate seemed to increase the desorption of phosphate most effectively, but after a longer equilibration period, the differences between additions of V, Mo, and W became smaller. In the second experiment, the adsorption process was followed as a function of the acidity of the suspension (pH 2.3-7.5; for W pH 2.8-7.5).

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to investigate the effect and benefit of applying plant growth regulators (PGR) to two easily lodging barley cultivars, Arra and Kilta, which were commonly used for fodder production all over Finland. Field trials were conducted at six experimental sites in different parts of the country. Of the PGRs tested, ethephon and mepiquat/ethephon were the most effective in shortening the culm and preventing lodging. However, neither could prevent the lodge adequately in all growing circumstances. When applied at flag-leaf stage (FS 10) they increased yield under conditions favourable for lodging. They also raised the volume weight of barley, which was important for the final price of the yield. The most important factors determining future lodging of barley were an effective temperature sum of over +5°C and precipitation during the period from sowing to the beginning of tillering (FS 2). About 64-68% of the lodging risk of the cultivars studied could be predicted from weather conditions during early development of the crop. Local growing conditions and the presence of lodge had a marked impact on the results obtained with PGRs. In the case of moderate lodging the compound used determined whether a profit or loss was made on the crop. In the case of heavy lodging, compounds containing ethephon contributed to an economic return. Their application at flag-leaf stage gave a profit of FIM 70 - 390 ha-1. Since the profitability of PGR treatments depended on lodging, treatments are recommended for fodder barley only when lodging is expected. The lodging risk can be predicted within certain limits at the tillering stage of barley.",

The effect of early summer irrigation on the yield was also studied. The yield and nitrogen uptake of the crop were determined for four successive years. Soil penetrometer resistance was measured annually after the second loading. The traffic compacted the soil to 0.35 m depth. On average, soil compaction reduced barley yield by 5% and nitrogen uptake by 7%. No annual cumulative increase in the compaction depth or yield reductions was found. Probably only the first loading compacted the subsoil, because the soil was drier than field capacity in the 0.2-0.3 m layer in the following autumns. The use of trailer low-profile tyres did not reduce the depth of compaction or yield losses. On average, early summer irrigation increased grain yield by 34% and nitrogen uptake by 25%, but it did not significantly decrease yield or nitrogen uptake reductions due to compaction.",

    "abstract": "Advances in gene transfer technologies have enabled the production of both monocot and dicot transgenic plants. With the biolistic method, genes can be transferred in recalcitrant crop plants and forest trees, independent of their genotype. Inexpensive methods for both stable and transient gene transfers - ultrasonication, direct DNA insertion during imbibition using somatic embryos, and silicon carbide fibres - have been developed. The frequency of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation rates of cloned genes can be enhanced in plant cells. The analysis of molecular markers (RFLPs, RAPDs, DNA fingerprints) can accomplish the characterization, gene mapping and identification and certification and patent protection of cultivars. With PCR, selective amplification of a specific DNA segment from a small amount of an organism’s total DNA can be used toidentify transgenic cultivars. The expression of a target gene can be inhibited with antisense RNA. So far, a limited number of genes have been identified and cloned with genetic engineering. With specific gene transfers, many goals such as biological control of insect pests and fungi, male sterility, virus resistance, improving seed protein, and production of transgenic plants as “bioreactors” can be accomplished. T-DNA mutagenesis may lead to learning more about the genetic control of plant development and morphogenesis, and isolation of useful mutants. Before genetic engineering becomes a reliable tool of plant breeding, more attention is needed to explore: (a) new plant genetic resources in order toidentify and clone new genes, (b) fate of selective and scorable marker genes, and (c) field evaluation of transgenes in transgenic plants.",

The limed soils contained ammonium acetate extractable magnesium 2—24 % less than the unlimed soils. The decrease in magnesium content was greatest in acid muddy silt (Littorina soil) and in acid silty clay.

Rumen samples were taken before feeding, and 2 ½ and 5 ½ hours after the beginning of feeding. Rumen fermentation was lower in the reindeer than in the sheep and differed less between the three sampling times. In the reindeer/the pH of the rumen fluid averaged 6.94 and in the sheep 6.61. The average amounts of NH3—N were 17.0 and 24.2 mg/100 ml rumen fluid and those of total VFA 8.46 and 10.90 mmoles/100ml rumen fluid, respectively. The proportion of acetic acid in the VFA in the reindeer was 75.3 molar % and in the sheep 66.0 molar %, the corresponding values for propionic acid being 18.5 and 22.0 molar % and for butytic acid 4.2 and 8.8 molar %. The number of rumen ciliates in the reindeer averaged 87/mm3 rumen contents and in the sheep 314/ mm3. The numbers of bacteria were 16.0 X 106/mm3, respectively.

In Exp. 2 an application level of 12 % was compared with AIV II solution used at a level of 3 l/1000 kg. Barley was rolled before ensiling and water was added so that the moisture content was 55 % in Exp. 1 and 55—60 % in Exp. 2. Digestibility and nitrogen retention in growing pigs, liveweight 31—81 kg, were determined for dried barley, propionic acid treated barley and barleys ensiled with AIV II or wood molasses (12 % of barley DM). In Exp. 1 the application level of 8 % unneulralized wood molasses (pH 2) was sufficient to prevent deterioration during storage. The preservative effect was based mainly on the acidity provided by organic acids. With the higher level of application the lactic acid content was lower (P &lt; 0.05). In Exp. 2barley ensiled with neutralized wood molasses had a higher (P &lt; 0.01) lactic and acetic acid content and a lower pH value (P &lt; 0.05) than barley ensiled with AIV II. Wood molasses decreased protein breakdown during the storage. The effect of DM content on fermentation and proteolysis was greater for AIV II ensiled barley. During the storage the sugar content increased because of starch hydrolysis. DM, organic matter (OM), NFE and starch digestibilities were lower on diets of barley ensiled with AIV II and wood molasses than on dried barley diet (P &lt; 0.05). OM digestibilities for the diets were 82.2, 81.0 and 85.4 %, respectively. The digestibility of barley treated with propionic acid was slightly lower than that of dried barley.

The relationship between ANC3.8 g and soil characteristics was studied statistically. In 84 soil samples, ANC3.8 ranged from 12 to 184 meq kg-1. The average ANC3.8 was highest in the heavy clay soils and lowest in the non-clay soils, but the differences between the various textural soil groups were not significant. In all soil groups the initial pHCaCl2 was relatively the most important factor explaining the variation in ANC3.8. Organic C was also a significant variable; this was considered to indicate the importance of cation exchange reactions of organic matter in acid-buffering. With the exception of heavy clay soils, oxalate-soluble Al significantly explained the variation in ANC3.8, suggesting that dissolution of Al hydroxides acted as a sink for H+ ions and contributed to the neutralizing capacity at the reference pH of 3.8.",

Tomato black ring virus (TBRV) and raspberry ringspot virus (RRSV) were isolated for the first time in Finland. The abundant occurence of TBRV in 32 samples was due to the abundance of Phlox paniculata samples. RRSV was isolated from only a few samples. The vectors of all of the above-mentioned viruses were found in many samples. The fungus vector of TNV, Olpidium brassicae, was investigated by examining the roots microscopically. The vector of TRV, the Trichodorus sp. nematodes, and the vector of TBRV and RRSV, the Longidorus sp. nematodes, were isolated from soil samples. In addition to the foregoing, tobacco mosaic virus was isolated from 31 samples of 6 nurseries and 2 experimental fields. Viruses were isolated from many weed samples, especially from roots of Senecio vulgaris and Stellaria media. Perennials proved to be virotic. All of the above mentioned viruses, especially TBRV and TRV, were isolated from Phlox paniculata; TBRV was also found in an Astilbe x arendsii sample. Dicentra spectabilis, like Phlox, was commonly infected with TRV. No clear results could be obtained from control experiments.",

    "abstract": "The exertional myopathy situation is surveyed for the top of the breeding pyramid of the Finnish Landrace breed by testing 2,003 pigs and from material on the Norwegian Landrace (86 pigs). The usefulness of the different methods as well as practical measures with regard to the breeding programme are discussed. The halothane sensitivity frequency in the Finnish Landrace breed was found to be 12.4%, indicating that about 58 % of all Finnish Landrace pigs at the top of breeding pyramid have the halothane sensitivity gene (Haln). In contrast, a frequency of only 3.2 % was found in the Norwegian material. Of the Finnish Landrace pigs 60.7 % had the H blood group factor a, 38.0 % factor c and 16.7 %none of these factors. In the Norwegian material 62.0 % had factor a and 55.6 % factor c. Of the Finnish hal+ pigs 91.1% had the H blood group factor a and 3.2 % factor c, while 6.1 % had none of these factors. About 96.6 % of the hal+ pigs had the Phi enzyme type BB and 3.4% the Phi-type AB. None of the Phi-type AA pigs were sensitive to halothane. Phi AA was found to be rare in the Finnish Landrace, with only 1.5 % of the animals having this Phi type. The water-holding capacity measurements from muscle biopsies taken from the pigs at the end of the halothane test did not show statistically significant differences between groups of hal+ and hal— pigs. It was concluded from the results of the present study that the measurement of CK serum activity in nonstressed pigs is not very useful for identification of the hetcrozygotic carriers of the Haln gene.The iterativeness of the CK test in non-stressed pigs was found tobe poor, but muscle tissue might have infected some of the serum samples taken from the vena cava and so caused false high serum CK activity. The halothane test is reliable for the identification of Haln gene homozygotes when conducted on pigs older than 50 days. The Phi AA type is so rare that Phi enzyme typing in Finland is of limited value at present for the breeding programme. A determination of the H blood group factors a and c of all pigs intended for breeding is advised. By increasing the number of pigs with the H blood group factor c it should be possible to reduce the exertional myopathy problem in the Finnish Landrace breed. Preferential use of the desirable genotype c of the H blood group system should be more attractive to breeders than selecting against the undesirable H blood group factor a, especially as many of the H a/a and H a/ pigs have a high K index and a high percentage of lean meat on the carcase. The best a/a and a/pigs may be kept as breeding animals but have to be mated only to H c/ pigs. Because some H c/ pigs are carriers of the Haln gene and a high K index and percentage of lean meat on the carcase favour carriers of the Haln gene, it is most probable that the existing low frequency of H c/ pigs sensitive to halothane will change in the future in an unfavourable direction. It is therefore advisable to stipulate a halothane test based on a progeny test for all H c/ boars with a high K index. Halothane-sensitive sows would be especially suitable for these test matings.",

The most apparent difference between the light and normal oats was the contents of starch and crude fibre and the digestibility of NFE. Clear differences were also found in the colours of meals, although all oats were light-coloured varieties. The difference in the energy value between the best and the poorest was 13 % by the digestibility and 15 % by the feeding trial. The difference in the economic return on the oats was 23%. The energy values of the three normal oats were very much alike. One of the two light oats was darker in colour and poorly palatable due to damage during harvest. Its energy value was found lower in the feeding trial than in the digestibility trial. Our results show that light weight oats, if not damaged, are useful feed for pigs, even though their nutritive values arc lower. The feed value of damaged oats, on the other hand, could not be predicted from the chemical composition, nor sufficiently even from the results of the digestibility trial.",

The experiment consisted of 130 rams on two feeding levels. In one group the rams were fed both hay and concentrates ad libitum, while in the other group concentrates were restricted. 124 of the rams were ultrasonically photographed, 61 from the ad libitum and 63 from the restricted feeding group. Weights (5 mths), daily gains and areas of MLD were approximately 39.3 kg (s.d. 4.4), 249 g (42), 11.6 cm2 (1.35) and 33.1 kg (4.6), 182g (32) and 9.4 cm2 (0.96) respectively. The ultrasonic area of the MLD correlated 0.52 and 0.32 with the area measured from carcasss. As a rule the ultrasonic area of the MLD correlated positively with other measures of live animals and slaughter results, but correlations with measures of relative meatiness were almost all nonsignificant. In completing the information concerning dressing weight and quantity of meat given by live weight, the ultrasonic area of the MLD proved to be the best of the measures on live animals. The rams in this experiment came from all over Finland but the next stage will consist mostly of progeny of the rams now selected (the two best and the two medium ones from both groups). With progeny testing the success of selection based on phenotype will be checked.",

The study was conducted by comparing first the growth performance of eleven bull calves until an average age of 126 days (Phase 1) when the five calves were fed acidified milk either ad libitum (FM) for 17 weeks or when six calves were given acidified milk restrictively (5 l per day, RM) for nine weeks. Bulls had ad libitum access to grass silage and concentrate. Secondly, the performance of bulls having an average age of 175 days until slaughter (at an average age of 429 days) at a carcass weight of approximately 290 kg was assessed (Phase 2). All animals were fed grass silage ad libitum and concentrate at a level of 620 g kg-1 of dietary dry matter. Calves fed acidified milk ad libitum grew significantly (P &lt; 0.01) faster than those fed restrictively during the first nine weeks of Phase 1 (1003 vs. 725 g per day). The bulls in the RM group grew a little but not significantly faster during Phase 2, the growth rates being 1197 vs. 1207 g per day. The feed conversion, weight (535 vs. 533 kg at slaughter) and slaughter results were equal. Similarly the life-time gains did not differ being 1174 (FM) and 1141 (RM) g per day, respectively. It can be concluded that the improved performance during early life did not improve growth during the fattening period.;",

Then crops were grown for three years without any application of phosphorus fertilizers. The phosphorus analyses of the soil at the end of the seventh experimental year proved that the largest part of rock phosphate occurred in the acid soluble fraction, probably mainly as unweathered apatite. The superphosphate phosphorus seemed to be accumulated as fluoride-soluble and alkali-soluble forms. In the trial on the humus soil of a fairly high productivity, the residual effect of both fertilizers on three oat crops was insignificant. In the trial on the poorer fine sand soil, the residues of both fertilizers produced significant and mutually equal increases in the dry matter yields of the oat crop in the first year and of the hay crops in the second and third years. The tendency to a higher phosphorus content in the graminaceous plants from the superphosphate plots resulted in a higher uptake of phosphorus from these plots as compared with the phosphorus yield from the rock phosphate plots; only in the third year the difference was no more significant. Attention was paid to the good capacity of red clover to use phosphorus of rock phosphate.",

The pollen beetle samples were tested for sensitivity to lambda-cyhalothrin, thiacloprid, and chlorpyrifos. The efficacy of the tested insecticides varied considerably by region. We observed a clear decrease in susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin and thiacloprid, but sensitivity to chlorpyrifos remained stable throughout the period between 2015 and 2019. Amongst the tested samples in that period, a total of 3% were classified as susceptible to lambda-cyhalothrin, 18% as moderately resistant, 70% as resistant, and 7% as highly resistant. In the case of thiacloprid, 21% of the samples were highly susceptible to the insecticide, 39% were susceptible, and 41% had reduced levels of susceptibility to the insecticide. The information which was presented tended to confirm the ongoing evolution of insecticide resistance in the B. aeneus population in Estonia, while also highlighting the importance of data-based decisions when optimising insecticide resistance management in the field.",

The material consisted of 32 samples of various kinds of soils. Air-drying did not cause any change in the acetic acid P of about one half of the samples and in the adsorbed P of about one third of the samples. A slight increase in the test values was found for a couple of samples. The tendency to a decrease was markedly higher in the values of adsorbed P than in the values of acetic acid P: an average decrease of 28 per cent in 19 samples was found in the former test while the corresponding value in the latter test was 13 per cent in 13 samples. No changes in the test values of Teräsvuori occurred in about one half of the samples, and the fairly low changes in the other half of the material were almost evenly distributed between increases and decreases. No connection between the changes in the test values upon air-drying and the moisture content of the fresh sample, the pH-value, the content of organic carbon, or the contents of iron and aluminium soluble in Tamm’s acid oxalate solution could be demonstrated. The changes in the various test values did not usually go in same direction. The importance of the possible error caused by air-drying is diminished by the sampling errors and by the variation in the soil P conditions.",

It was noted that in order to determine the height and location of the maximal producing capacity of a cow in a known lactation period, it is preferable to choose the peak production as a mean of three subsequent best days. It was also noted that the usual methods for drawing the average lactation curves do not give a true picture of the height and location of the peak. The author suggests a method for determining the average lactation curve at the ascending phase by using the averages of both milk productions and times involved in reaching the peak and known fractions (e.g. 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and 5/4) of it. In this lactation curve the peak production is the mean of the peaks of individual cows, and the time involved in reaching it is the mean of the durations of the ascending phases of the individual cows.",

The same fungus occurred even more abundantly in the spring 1961. During both winters, 1952—53 and 1960—61, there were especially large amounts of low temperature parasitic fungi. Thus, in the spring 1961 Sclerotinia borealis Bubak &amp; Vleugel caused almost the complete destruction of first-year timothy leys and had badly damaged older leys. In addition, stands of red clover, which generally overwinter well at Muddusniemi (5, 6, 7), were found to be severely injured. For example, in the red clover sowing time trial (sowing dates 15.6.1960 and 15.7.1960), all the clover varieties, including the Finnish variety Tammisto, were completely destroyed in the course of the winter, In investigating the cause of the clover destruction, it was found that the fungal growths observed on the roots of dead clover plants were black, hard, slightly flattened spherical formations, 5—11 mm in diameter. They occurred in all parts of the surface of dark-colored, dead roots, but they were most numerous in the upper parts of the roots, where they appeared as dense clusters (Fig. 1). The fungus was isolated on Henneberg agar (2) in Petri dishes and was cultured at temperatures of +2°C, +7°C and +22°C. On the basis of the culture tests as well as the symptoms observed in the roots of infected clover plants, it was possible to determine this fungus as being Plenodomus meliloti Dearness &amp; Sanford (1, 4). This fungus belongs to the Sphaeropsidales order of the Fungi Imperfecti.",

In unsterilized samples the infection was less severe and showed marked variations in different years and at different times of the year. In the outdoor trials clover became less infected in the middle of the summer than in the spring and autumn. On the other hand, in the thermostat trials, where the temperature was constantly 7—10°C, the temperature at the time of taking the soil samples did not have a pronounced effect on the extent of clover infection. Liming of the soil caused a marked decrease in the severity of clover rot infection. In some autumns clover plants growing in soil samples taken from fallow were more seriously infected than those growing in soil from a clover field. As a rule, however, there were only slight variations in the extent of infection in the soil samples taken at the same time from the various areas of the field cultivated in different ways. In general, the highest numbers of microorganisms in the soil were found in the autumn and the lowest in the spring. In clover fields there were often more microorganisms – particularly in the autumn – than in fallow. Liming caused an increase in the numbers of soil microbes. S. trifoliorum infected clover very severely at temperatures of 0—5°C; in the range 5—21°C the infection grew generally milder the more the temperature was found to be rising. At temperatures of 5– 10°C an increase in the numbers of soil microbes resulted in a decrease in the infection of the clover. Still higher temperatures, which did not increase the numbers of soil microorganisms, nevertheless enhanced the antagonistic power of the soil.",

    "abstract": "Von den Stickstoff-Formen, die seit langem als N-Düngemittel gebräuchlich sind, hat jede ihre Vorteile und Nachteile für die N-Versorgung von Futterpflanzen. Alle zusammen werden sehr rasch, z.T. nach Umwandlung in Salpeter, von den Pflanzen aufgenommen und deshalb ist ihre Wirkung meistens sehr schnell im ersten Aufwuchs verpufft. Aber die beiden jetzt in Deutschland in Prüfung befindlichen langsam löslichen N-Düngemittel, der Ureaform und das Floranid, weisen in der grossen Abhängigkeit ihrer Löslichkeit von der derzeitigen Witterung oft eine schlechtere Wirkung als die althergebrachten Düngemittel auf. Ihr Preis, der jetzt für landwirtschaftliche Nutzung vollkommen undiskutabel ist, dürfte in Angebot und Nachfrage eine starke Senkung erfahren können. Die Ansichten über die Höhe der Stickstoffdüngung sind bei Futterpflanzen seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg in Fluss geraten. Während wir auf der Intensivweide relativ klar sehen, nämlich dass wir sehr hoch, in günstiger Klimalage bis 300 kg/ha N, düngen dürfen, kann die Menge, die von den verschiedenen Pflanzengesellschaften der Dauerwiese ausgenutzt wird, noch nicht sicher mit festen Ratschlägen angegeben werden. Im Ackerfutterbau treten, wie auf dem Dauergrünland, nach stärkeren N-Gaben Veränderungen in der stofflichen Zusammensetzung des Aufwuchses ein, die tierphysiologische Bedeutung haben, wenn nicht eine Kompensation mit anderen Futtermitteln vorgenommen wird, die vor allem eine Ergänzung in Form von essentiellen Aminosäuren besitzen. Es zeichnen sich noch andere natürliche Grenzen ab, z.B. nach starker Nutzung in der unvollkommenen Ersetzung von Reservestoffen in der Graspflanze durch Stickstoffdüngung, sowie in der unvollständigen Verarbeitung des in mineralischer Form aufgenommenen Stickstoffs durch die Pflanze. Wahrscheinlich dürfte indes in den meisten landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben die Höhe der verabreichten Stickstoffgaben letztlich mehr von betriebswirtschaftlichen Erwägungen als von solchen pflanzen- oder tierphysiologischer Art bestimmt werden.",

The effects of harvest date on lignin and sugar production, biomass yield, mineral element composition, bioenergy potential and soil nutrient management were determined in two years. The eight maize cultivars produced 17.6–33.3 t ha-1 of biomass. The ear fraction contained 50–60% of the biomass, and ash and mineral element composition of the plant fractions were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001), with more ash, Ca and S in the above-ear fractions of the plants than in the mid-stalk portions, whereas the C:N ratio was highest in the lower stalk. Cultivars with less lignin content produced more fermetable sugars. Despite the relatively cool growing conditions and short season of the sub-boreal region, maize has potential for use as biomass, for biofuel or other uses. The crop can be fractioned into ear and stalk, with the lower 20 cm of stalk left in the field to maintain soil organic matter content.",

Feed and energy intake as well as the live weight gain of the bulls decreased when the second cut silage was used instead of the first cut silage. No differences in carcass conformation or carcass fat score between the treatments were observed. Analysed chemical, digestibility or fermentation parameters of the silage samples did not explain the differences in feed intake.

    "abstract": "The author gives a critical report on the American system of rural appraising. Although the advantages of the system, in which income appraisal and commercial appraisal are effected parallelly, are realized, there seem to be some considerations in need of further study. The author devotes special attention to the possibility of using net rent as a measure of land value. Since the appraisal method is to a great extent based on capitalization of net landlord income or net rent, the question arises whether the average net rent equals the average annual net return from the farms. The author concludes that this cannot be the true situation in the USA. It is inevitable that the tenant invests his labour and capital as entrepreneur and is therefore quite justified in demanding a part of the entrepreunial rent. If, however, net rent equals net return he does not get any of it. This can happen only in cases where land is scarce and landowners maintain monopoly power. A real equilibrium is possible only when the advantages of purchasing and of renting are in balance from the viewpoint of the farmer. Even a rapid survey of recent trends in the composition of farm capital shows how greatly increased is the share of farm investment which to-day must be met by the tenant. Again, it has been statistically shown that the difference between capitalized rent value of land and its market value has been increasing during the last few decades. In all probability a part of this difference may be the result of an increase in the share of the farm capital which the tenant has to invest, and thus perhaps has no relation to the increase or decrease of net return from the farm. Among other minor points raised by the author, the problem of determining the right capitalization rate seems to him to be especially in need of further intensive study.",

    "abstract": "In der Untersuchung sind durch Vergleich der Stellung der von einem und demselben Bullen in verschiedenen Herden hiterlassenen Nachkommen die durchschnittlichen qualitativen Unterschiede der Herden zu klären versucht worden. Dabei ist angenommen worden, dass in einer qualitativ besseren Herde die Nachkommen eines und desselben Bullen im Vergleich zu den übrigen Kühen der Herde ungünstiger gestanden haben als in einer schwächeren Herde, d.h. die Nachkommen haben in einer besseren Herde durchschnittlich einen geringeren relativen Wert angenommen als in einer schlechteren. Infolge der Vererbung in Zwischenform ist vorausgesetzt worden, dass die Grösse des Qualitätsunterschiedes doppelt so gross wie der Unterschied der relativen Werte der Nachkommengruppen sei. Die Vergleiche sind in Herden von verschiedenem mittleren Leistungsstand ausgeführt worden, und da der prozentuale Anteil des auf die angegebene Weise berechneten Qualitätsunterschiedes von den gesamten mittleren Leistungsunterschieden berechnet worden ist, haben sich Zahlen ergeben, die erkennen lassen, inwieweit sich die Unterschiede in den mittleren Leistungen der Herden auf die verschiedene Beschaffenheit der Tiere gründen. Da die Berechnung sich auf die relativen Werte der Nachkommengruppen gründet, erweisen die erhaltenen Prozentsätze auch, welcher Wert den mittleren Leistungen der Herde, im Vergleich mit den relativen Leistungen, als Indikatoren der Beschaffenheit der Tiere beizulegen ist. Als relativer Wert ist der in kg angegebene Unterschied der individuellen Leistung gegenüber der mittleren Leistung der Herde benutzt worden. Auch die den prozentualen relativen Werten entsprechenden Ergebnisse sind zur Berechnung gelangt. Als Material haben 5jährige Ayrshirekühe aus dem Kontrolljahr 1949—50 gedient, woneben man zur Bestätigung der Ergebnisse mit 7—11jährigen Tieren Wiederholungsberechnungen ausgeführt hat. Entsprechende Vergleiche wurden auch in bezug auf den Fettgehalt der Milch angestellt. Ergebnisse Als das Material der 5jährigen Kühe als Gesamtheit betrachtet wurde, schienen die Qualitätsunterschiede durchschnittlich 15.3 % (Tabelle 1) von den Gesamtunterschieden der mittleren Leistungen der Herden auszumachen. Bei Anwendung der prozentualen relativen Werte war der Anteil der Qualität noch geringer. Das erhaltene Ergebnis stimmt als solches recht gut mit den von Bonnier (I), Johansson (5), Robertson und Asker (11), Skjerwold (12) und Korkman (7) angegebenen Zahlenwerten in dem Sinne überein, dass die Qualität einen verhältnismässig geringen Anteil am Entstehen der Unterschiede in den mittleren Leistungen der Herden zu haben scheint. Als aber die Ergebnisse bei verschieden grossen Herden miteinander verglichen wurden, stellten sich bei beiden Materialien (Tabelle 2 und 3) für den Anteil der qualitativen Unterschiede bei den verschiedenen Grössengruppen der Herden sehr verschiedene Werte heraus. Die Entwicklung der Werte war insofern recht gleichmässig, als der geringste Wert (6.2 und 5.2 %) sich bei Herden von 10—19 Kühen ergab, während die Qualitätsunterschiede im allgemeinen mit steigender Tierzahl der Herden Zunahmen. Dass die Qualitätsunterschiede in der Gruppe der allerkleinsten Herden nicht am geringsten sind, mag als Beweis dessen gelten, dass die erhaltenen Unterschiede nicht einzig auf die Ungenauigkeit der bei kleinen Herden berechneten relativen Leistungen zurückzuführen sind. Auf der Suche nach den Ursachen hat sich die Aufmerksamkeit der verschiedenen Anwendung der Bullen in verschiedenen grossen Herden zugewandt. Zu der Gruppe der kleinen Herden gehören in erster Linie Herden, in denen schon lange Zeit gemeinsame Genossenschaftsbullen eingesetzt worden sind, während dagegen bei grossen Herden deren eigene Bullen nur selten und gelegentlich anderswo Nachkommen hinterlassen haben. Die gemeinsamen Bullen haben somit die qualitativen Unterschiede zwischen den kleinen Herden ausgeglichen. Da zugleich die Möglichkeiten der in den Herden vorzunehmenden Auslese bei grossen Herden grösser sind als bei kleinen, in denen das Beurteilen der Individuen unsicherer wie auch das Erhalten eines Nachkommen von einem Tier erwünschter Beschaffenheit schwieriger ist, ist es recht natürlich, dass für das Entstehen von Qualitätsunterschieden auf dem Wege der Veredlung bei grossen Herden die besten Möglichkeiten bestanden haben. Doch gibt es auch eine solche Möglichkeit, dass sich der verschiedene Anteil der Qualitätsunterschiede bei ungleich grossen Herden zum Teil auch auf die gleichmässigeren Erzeugungsmöglichkeiten grosser Herden, vor allem auf eine gleichmässigere Fütterung gründet. Es ist nicht möglich gewesen, diesen Umstand auf Grund des verfügbaren Materials zu untersuchen. Die Streuungen in den mittleren Leistungen der Herden deuten jedoch auf diese Möglichkeit hin, denn obgleich nach den Ergebnissen die Qualitätsunterschiede zwischen grossen Herden stärker sind als zwischen kleinen, belaufen sich bei dem Material der 5jährigen Kühe die Zahlenwerte der Streuung der mittleren Leistungen bei kleinen, mittel-grossen und grossen Herden auf 636 ±9, 582 ±12 und 620 ±19 kg. Die gesamte Wandlung in den mittleren Leistungen ist also bei den kleinsten Herden am grössten gewiesen. Die Streuung der relativen Milchleistungen ist gewiss um so geringer, je kleiner die Herden sind. Die Unterschiede sind aber nicht so gross (Tabelle 5), dass sie ausreichten, die erhaltenen Ergebnisse zu erklären. Die Ursache kann also wohl nicht in der Ungenauigkeit der relativen Leistungen kleiner Herden liegen. Dass die relativen Werte als Indikatoren für die Rangordnung der Tiere bei Herden aller Grössen praktisch gesehen von gleicher Bedeutung sind, mag auch aus den Korrelationen der relativen Werte der Milch und des Fettprozents hervorgehen, Korrelationen, die bei allen Gruppen gleich gross sind. Die Grösse des Anteils der Qualitätsunterschiede scheint wenigstens nicht deutlich von der Grösse der Mittelleistungsunterschiede abhängig zu sein (Tabelle 6). Dagegen ist die Streuung der als kg- Unterschiede ausgedrückten relativen Werte der Tiere bei höherem Leistungsstand grösser als bei niedrigem. Umgekehrt wie bei dem Ergebnis von Korkman (7) scheint dies darauf hinzuweisen, dass die prozentualen relativen Werte zweckmässiger sind als die Differenzen in kg. Diese Auffassung wird auch dadurch gestützt, dass der Wert des Variationskoeffizienten, der zugleich die auf Grund der prozentualen relativen Leistungen festgestellte Streuung widerspiegelt, vielmehr abnimmt bei stiegendem Leistungsstand, wie es auch zu geschehen hat, wenn man annimmt, dass die Herden dabei auch qualitativ besser werden. Die Differenzen in kg sind aber nicht nur leichter zu berechnen, sondern auch, besonders zusammen mit den mittleren Leistungen der Herden, einfacher anzuwenden als die prozentualen Werte, weswegen es angebracht sein könnte, bei praktischer Züchtungsarbeit zu ihrer Anwendung überzugehen. Die Unterschiede zwischen diesen auf verschiedene Weise berechneten relativen Leistungen dürften jedenfalls sehr gering sein. Die entsprechenden Vergleiche hinsichtlich des Fettgehaltes der Milch (Tabelle 7 und 8) zeigen, dass der durchschnittliche Anteil der Qualitätsunterschiede an den Gesamtunterschieden der mittleren Fettprozentsätze grösser ist als bei den Milchmengen. Dagegen hat die Grösse der Herden wenigstens keinen deutlichen Einfluss auf den Anteil der Qualitätsunterschiede ausgeübt. Je grösser aber der Unterschied in den mittleren Leistungen der Herden gewesen ist, desto grösser ist offenbar der Teil davon gewesen, der sich auf die Qualität gegründet hat (Tabelle 9). Auch scheint der Anteil der Qualität um so grösser zu sein, je höher der Stand des Fettgehaltes ist, um den es sich handelt (Tabelle 10). Die Ursache zu derartigen von der Milcherzeugung abweichenden Ergebnissen kann darin bestehen, dass an der Vererbung des Fettgehaltes die herrschenden Gene beträchtlich beteiligt sind, wie Dinkhauser (2) und Hammond (3) erklärt haben. Wenn es sich so verhält, sind die für den Anteil der Qualität aus den Mittelleistungsdifferenzen erhaltenen Ergebnisse vermutlich kleiner als in Wirklichkeit. Jedenfalls scheint das Ergebnis für das Verfahren zu sprechen, das bei der praktischen Züchtungsarbeit die Beuer-teilung der Neigung zum Fettgehalt auf Grund der Fettprozentsätze als solcher, ohne Berechnung relativer Werte, vor sich geht. In dieser Hinsicht stützen die hier dargelegte Auffassung die früheren Untersuchungen des Verfassers (16), nach denen bei der auf die Erzeugungswerte gegründeten Auslese der Bullen die Fettprozentsätze als solche zu einer besser gelungenen Auslese führten als ihre relativen Werte. Es sei angeführt, dass bei diesen früheren Untersuchungen in der Züchtung auf Neigung zur Milcherzeugung hingegen die relative Beurteilungsweise gegenüber der absoluten zu einer geglückteren Auslese zu führen schien. Eine Ausnahme bildete ein Vergleichsmaterial zwischen Muttertieren und Söhnen, Als nach den nunmehr erhaltenen Ergebnissen bei den Muttertieren des besagten Materials die Grösse ihrer Herden untersucht wurde, liess sich erkennen, dass sie ohne Ausnahme aus sehr grossen Herden waren die durchschnittliche Anzahl der Kühe belief sich bei diesen auf 54, während sie bei den Kontrollherden in entsprechender Zeit durchschnittlich etwa 7.5 ausmachte. Die Erklärung lag also darin, dass, da die Muttertiere aus grossen Herden waren, bei denen an dem Zustandekommen der Unterschiede zwischen den mittleren Leistungen die Qualität der Tiere recht stark beteiligt ist, die auf die absoluten Leistungen der Mütter gegründete Auslese zu einem besser gelungenen Ergebnis führte als die ausschliesslich auf relative Werte gestützte. Bei Anwendung der Untersuchungsergebnisse auf die Praxis ist zunächst zu berücksichtigen, dass der Mittelwert der Rasse in bezug auf den Anteil der qualitativen Unterschiede der Herden von der Verteilung der Tiere auf verschieden grosse Herden abhängig ist. Werden auf dieser Grundlage die Mittelwerte der finnischen Herdenrassen berechnet, so ergibt sich für die Ayrshirerasse der Wert 1/5 und für die finnische Landrasse 1/9. Bei Beurteilung der Qualität des einzelnen Tieres ist demgemäss neben den relativen Werten von den Unterschieden der mittleren Leistungen entweder von den gegenseitigen Unterschieden der Herden oder von den Abweichungen der Herden vom Mittelwert der Rasse je nach der Rasse 1/5—1/9 zu berücksichtigen. Bei Anwendung prozentualer relativer Werte sind die entsprechenden Werte 1/7 und 1/10. Zu den besten Ergebnissen gelangt man aber, wenn der Anteil der Qualitätsunterschiede bei jeder Grössenklasse der Herden mit den ihnen eigenen Verhältniszahlen berechnet wird, die, auf graphischem Wege berechnet, in Tabelle 11 angegeben sind.",

Therefore, two animal model evaluations with two different data sets were computed. Data with all the records from the national evaluation in December 1994 was used to obtain estimated breeding values (EBV) for 305-days’ milk yield and protein yield. In the second evaluation, the PIs were estimated for cows calving the first time in 1993 by excluding all their production records from the data. Three different statistics, a simple t-test, the linear regression of EBV on PI, and the polynomial regression of the difference in the predictions (EBV-PI) on PI, were computed for three groups of first parity Ayrshire cows: daughters of proven sires, daughters of young sires, and daughters of bull dam candidates. A practically relevant bias was found only in the PIs for the daughters of young sires. On average their PIs were biased upwards by 0.20 standard deviations (78.8 kg) for the milk yield and by 0.21 standard deviations (2.2 kg) for the protein yield. The polynomial regression analysis showed that the magnitude of the bias in the PIs changed somewhat with the size of the PIs.",

In the first part of the paper, the authors review some recent applications of satellite remote sensing in agriculture. Techniques for crop discrimination and mapping have made such rapid progress that we can classify crop types with more than 80% accuracy. The estimation of crop biomass using satellite data, including leaf area, dry and fresh weights, and the prediction of grain yield, has been attempted using various spectral vegetation indices. Plant stresses caused by nutrient deficiency and water deficit have also been analysed successfully. Such information may be useful for farm management. In the latter half of the paper, we introduce the Arctic Science Project, which was carried out under the Science and Technology Agency of Japan collaborating with Finnish scientists. In this project, monitoring of the boreal forest was carried out using LANDSAT data. Changes in the phenology of subarctic ground vegetation, based on spectral properties, were measured by a boom-mounted, four-band spectroradiometer. The turning point dates of the seasonal near-infrared (NIR) and red (R) reflectance factors might indicate the end of growth and the beginning of autumnal tints, respectively.",

Much of the Basin is currently too cool and remote from markets to support a viable agricultural sector, but the southern portion of the Basin has the physical potential to support commercial agriculture. This case study employed agricultural land rating and crop models to estimate the degree to which a CO2 -induced global warming might alter the physical potential for commercial agriculture throughout the Basin. The two climate change scenarios considered in this analysis would relax the current constraints imposed by a short and cool frost-free season, but without adaptive measures, drier conditions and accelerated crop development rates were estimated to offset potential gains stemming from elevated CO2 levels and warmer temperatures. In addition to striving for a better understanding of the extent to which physical constraints on agriculture might be modified by climate change, there is a need to expand the research context and to consider the capacity of agriculture to adapt to altered climates.",

Many types of ridges are used, but the most suitable for carrot cultivation under the conditions prevailing in northern Europe has yet to be determined. The effects of ridging, seeding rate and sowing system on the yield and visible quality of carrots were therefore studied in the field during three years. The highest yields were recorded for carrots sown in double rows on a narrow ridge. The effect of sowing system on mean root weight differed depending on the ridging regime. The mean weight of roots was higher for carrots cultivated on broad ridges than in other systems. Seeding rate had the most significant effect on mean root weight. For industrial purposes it is recommended that carrots be cultivated on broad ridges in double rows at low seeding rates with irrigation. The optimal cultivation technique for carrots destined for the fresh vegetable market would be narrow ridges sown in double rows at high seeding rates. The ridging system, seeding rate and row spacing did not appear to affect the external quality of roots. More detailed studies should be carried out to establish the effects of abiotic growth factors under different ridging regimes.",

Concentrations of gases (ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) were measured with diffusion tubes. Airborne viable spores were collected with a cascade impactor on five selective culture media for the identification of xerophilic, mesophilic and thermotolerant fungi and thermophilic actinomycetes.

HMILKs are deviations from the average national level with mean of 45 kg and SD of 722 kg. Mean MY was 6917 kg and mean dry matter intake (DMI) 5679 kg per cow per year.

The general linear effect of CI was 1.18 kg MY/kg CI. Production response of CI decreased with increasing CI as indicated by significant interactions between CI and CI classes. Gc showed a negative relationship with HMILK, but CPc proved to be a more important factor affecting HMILK. Feeding grain instead of compound feed was connected with too low protein content in concentrates. Mc was positively correlated with CP content of concentrates. However, the use of compound feed appeared to give a slight increase in HMILK even after accounting for the effect of CP. ;",

Soil I, showing greater response to P fertilization in the field, adsorbed P considerably more effectively than did soil II. Also the quantities of reversibly adsorbed P were smaller in the subsamples of soil I as compared to those of soil II receiving the same fertilization. Fertilizer P applied during the field experiments had been adsorbed and converted to forms unavailable to plants to a larger extent in soil I, resulting in greater response to P fertilization in this soil.

Sulphate sorption was correlated with soil pH (r =—0.46**) and with phosphate sorption (r =0.69***). With increasing soil pH, sulphate sorption decreased in relation to phosphate sorption. Phosphorus status was decisive in explaining the sulphate sorption of the soils. Even if both anions are sorbed by the same soil component (amorphous Al compounds), the sites are not available for sulphate if they are already occupied by phosphate. Sulphate sorption was negligible in soils very rich in easily soluble phosphorus. This was reflected in a close negative correlation between sulphate sorption and acid ammonium acetate (pH 4.65) extractable phosphorus (r =—0.70***). During the last few decades, phosphorus fertilization has increased the amount of easily soluble phosphorus in Finnish fields, which obviously has decreased the capacity of the soils to retain sulphate.",

The field experiments were carried out in southern Finland, and the carrots were stored in refrigerated storage for six months in 1985 and four months in 1986. After storage period the marketable yield and weight loss were measured, carotene content was analyzed and a sensory evaluation for taste and texture was performed in both years. In 1986, also NO3-N, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, ash, glucose, fructose and sucrose were analysed. In 1985, after storage, NPK fertirrigations without basic fertilization showed a tendency to produce a lower marketable yield than single application and placement fertilization. In 1986, after storage, split application and NPK fertirrigations showed a tendency to produce a lower marketable yield than unirrigated single application. The supraoptimal N amount showed a tendency to have a higher carotene content than optimal N amount, and NPK fertirrigations lower NO3-N content than irrigated single application. The irrigated placement and broadcast treatments yielded high K contents. The unfertilized treatments yielded higher marketable yield, lower NO3-N, N and K contents than fertilized treatments as an average.",

It was given various levels of three fertilizers the N, P and K composition of which in percentages was 7-11-12, 18-3-12 and 27.5-0-0. The N levels were 0, 80/60, 140/120 and 300/240 kg/ha (1983/1984-85), but the P and K levels varied according to the composition of the fertilizers. In the first year the yields were high regardless of fertilization. The following years the yields were clearly highest in the plots where the fertilizer 7-11-12 was used. This was due to insufficient P and K supply in the other plots. With increasing N fertilization the starch content and mealiness of the tubers decreased and the flavor was degraded. The two higher N levels yielded a considerably higher nitrate content than was measured in tubers from unfertilized plots and those receiving the lowest levels of fertilizers. The present results point out the significance of appropriate N fertilization for potato. A certain N amount was necessary to produce a quantitatively satisfactory yield but excessive amounts had an adverse effect on the quality. P and K were of minor importance for the quality in this experiment, but abundant P and K fertilization was needed for optimum yield formation. Maintenance of soil K level proved difficult in continuous potato cultivation.",

This article deals with the observations made during this mission. 55 ulluco fields were visited. In general, the fields are small, 240m2 on average, and they are mostly situated on mountain slopes. The fields are fertilized with animal dung; chemical fertilizers are quite rare. In the fields, people work with hoes ang ploughs as they did hundreds of years ago. Mechanization of agriculture would prevent full utilization of the mountainous area of the Andes. Ulluco is usually interplanted with other crops, usually, many forms of ulluco in one field. Because of crop rotation description of the fields is partly valid for the cultivation of other crops, too. Due to drastic climatic variation, cultivation of mixed varieties maybe the best way to guarantee some yield. When results of the investigations are wished to benefit developing countries, knowledge of social, agricultural and environmental factors is of great value.",

Thereafter, the number of the infective larvae on pasture began to increase again. The infection rate on pasture was markedly higher close to the droppings than further away from them. It was shown that the vertical distribution of larvae on grass depends on the environmental humidity, temperature and light. The weight gain of all experimental animals, controls as well as those of treated with anthelmintics was modest. Consequently the effect of the anthelmintic treatment could not be estimated. Pathological changes in the abomasal wall caused by Ostertagia ostertagi were common, but only in a few cases were they severe. Neither did the abomasal pH-value or the serum pepsinogen content suggest a severe ostertagiasis",

Eighteen cows were used in each of the two experiments. The experimental period was 13 weeks in Expt. 1 and 15 weeks in Expt. 2. The apparent DM digestibilities of the DPM, SBM and UREA rations were 69.9, 72.0 and 74.0 % (P &lt; 0.05) and crude protein digestibilities were 72.0, 71.8 and 76.0 % (P &lt; 0.01). The FU-value of the DPM ration was lower (P &lt; 0.01) than the SBM and UREA rations. The palatability of the concentrate including DPM was depressed (P &lt; 0.05). The differences in milk yield and milk constituents between groups were not statistically significant.

    "abstract": "Trials with maize varieties from various places in the world were started in 1975. In preliminary trials in 1975, 280 varieties were tested. Between 19 and 23 varieties were selected for ordinary variety tests in 1976—78 at the University farm in Siuntio. Weather conditions, particularly average daily temperatures in 1975 were better than the long term averages, and in 1976—78 far below the average growing conditions. Dry matter yields of the seven harvested silage varieties in 1975 varied between 5.8 and 11.5 tons/ha. In 1976—78 the variation in DM yields was 3.8—8.0 tons/ha among 19—23 varieties. In 1975, 44 varieties out of 280 produced mature seed. Only one variety matured in 1978, but none in 1976—77. The developmental stage of silage maize is primarily determined by ear percentage and secondarily by DM %. In 1975 the average ear % of seven varieties was 49.1 %, in 1978 18.1 % and in 1976—77 only 4.0—5.7 % in DM. As a result of the variety tests promising varieties from Yugoslavia, France and Germany could be found. It can be concluded from the long term temperature data that with very early hybrid varieties a mature grain yield can be harvested twice in ten years. Good quality silage material can be harvested six times in ten years and a satisfactory crop can be obtained eight times in then years. The limiting factor for the growth and development of maize in Finland is the low average temperature of the growing season. Important but less significant is the length of the vegetative period, which is determined by the first killing frost in the fall. The temperature deficit is particularly critical at the beginning of the growing season.",

The amino acid compositions of the rumen bacteria showed very slight changes even though the diets were very different. The amino acid compositions of the pure bacterial strains isolated from the rumina differed slightly. The amino acid compositions of the rumen protozoa of the ULP- and NorP-cows differed only with respect to isoleucine and tyrosine. Protozoa could be found only occasionally in the rumen of the 0-cow, there being only two species. Their nutritional significance was obviously very small. When the nutritional quality of the microbial protein was studied on the basis of its amino acid composition it was found that the EAA-I of bacteria did not differ significantly. Neither did the EAA-I of protozoa differ. The pepsin-pancreatin in vitro digestibility of protozoa was higher on all the feeds than that of bacteria. The rumen bacterial in vitro digestibility with 0-cows differed from that of the ULP-samples but not from that of the NorP-samples. The digestibility of single amino acids, With the exception of diaminopimelic acid, glycine and alanine, did not differ from the digestibility of the total amino acids. The much larger number of bacteria in the rumen of 0-cows compared with those of ULP- and NorP-cows compensates in this way for the lower digestibility of bacterial protein in 0-cows. The PPDR-I of both bacteria and protozoa were well correlated with the in vitro digestibility.",

The feeding values of the silages were determined with sheep according to 2 X 3 X 3 Latin square design. Urea (0.3 % of the fresh weight) was added to the silages before feeding. An intense secondary fermentation was found in all silages. The possible causes for this were the soil contamination of the fodder during harvesting and the effluent remained in the stack silages. The secondary fermentation decreased the sugar content of the silages and increased the fermentation losses especially in the corn silage. However, the quality of the silages was fairly good. Urea decreased the palatability of the silages and it would be better to add the urea to the silages before the ensiling. The energy and DCP values of the silages were quite modest.

    "abstract": "In order to examine the application time of nitrogen given to cereals, several tests have been arranged on the Kotkaniemi Experimental Farm at Vihti ever since 1965. The tests have been carried out on solid clay soils, where the leaching of nitrogen has been expected to be slow. In spring cereals the autumn application of nitrogen in November on frozen soil has given a good crop yield. The protein content of the crop in the plots where nitrogen was given in autumn was lower than in those where the spreading took place in spring. As for winter wheat, application in December has given the best average crop yields but the decline of the protein content is to be considered a disadvantage. In rye, spring fertilization has given the best average crop yield. There has, however, clearly been less lodging in autumn applications than in plots where the nitrogen was spread in the spring. Regarding nitrogen fertilization of autumn sown plants the usual custom in Finland is to give nitrogen in autumn for growth during the autumn and in the spring for the coming growing season. However, as low rainfall is typical ofthe Finnish spring, the effect of nitrogen given by broadcasting in early summer is slow, especially on solid soils like clay. As for spring cereals, the fertilizer placement at a depth of 8 to 10 cms has given distinctly better results than broadcasting and the usual mixing into the soil (Elonen 1967, Larpes 1966 and 1968, Nieminen 1967, Pessi 1970). The difference in the growth intensity has most clearly been evident in the early development of cereals. Simultaneously it has become clear that the placement of nitrogen has been of the greatest importance (Pessi 1970). As during winter in Finland the soil is usually frozen and covered with snow, no noteworthy leaching of nutrients takes place. On the basis of the results and observations mentioned above the question are as to what it would mean in practice in solid soils if the nitrogen was spread already before snowfall or on the snow, when the water from the melting snow would in spring cause the nitrogen to penetrate the soil. For this purpose tests were started on the Kotkaniemi Experimental Farm of Rikkihappo Oy in autumn 1965.",

This paper deals with a part of this project. The varieties were the two-rowed brewing barleys Ingrid, Arvo and Karri and the six-rowed enzyme barley Pirkka. As a basic fertilizing 59 kg phosphorus and 99 kg potassium per hectare were administered. Varying nitrogen levels (30 or 60 kg N per hectare) were given as saltpetre at harrowing (early) or on the sprouts (late). The nitrogen given early increased the yield in all varieties more than the late spreading. The treatment on sprouts increased the protein content of the yield. The difference in protein contents between the two spreading times was as big as the difference between the two nitrogen doses given at the same point of time. Ingrid and Pirkka reacted very sensitively to the late nitrogen fertilizing. Karri was least sensitive to the changes in nitrogen supply. The yearly fluctuations of the protein contents were bigger than the differences between varieties in each year. The order of varieties in regard to the protein content was the same in all trial years: Pirkka, Ingrid, Arvo and Karri. Besides the cultivation technique, e.g. placement of fertilizers, attention must be paid to the sensitivity of the varieties in increasing their protein content under changeable conditions.",

The ideal negative DCAD was only attained on soils very low in plant available K. Timing (spring versus late spring) and source of Cl (CaCl2 versus MgCl2) were of no importance for the result. When pure stands of seven grasses were fertilised in spring either without chloride or with 140 kg chloride per hectare, the lowest values of DCAD after chloride fertilisation were found in perennial ryegrass and reed canary grass. By comparison, cocksfoot had equally high or higher Cl concentrations in its tissues, but accumulated more K, and seemed to be poorly suited for low DCAD forage production.

Positive effects on rumen fermentation could not be demonstrated in a feeding situation where total mixed ration and a concentrate proportion of 0.50 on DM basis was used. Diet organic matter digestibility was not affected by MCC inclusion but fibre digestibility improved and the additional MCC fibre was virtually completely digested. The production potential of MCC was lower than that of barley grain as daily yields of energy-corrected milk, milk fat and protein, and milk protein concentration decreased when MCC replaced barley grain in the diet. Based on these results, MCC is not recommended as a dietary component for high-yielding dairy cows.",

By exploring the gene expression dynamics of this tissue during preimplantation development, we may be able to get insight into the genetic mechanisms of reproduction during early pregnancy. Here, we have performed comparative transcriptome profiling of the endometrium in response to spherical (Day 7 to Day 12) and elongated (Day 13 to Day 17) embryos in Finnsheep, Texel and their F1 crosses using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. A total of 21125 genes were expressed in our dataset of which 554 were significantly (absolute log2 fold change &gt; 2.5; adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01) upregulated in the endometrium with elongated embryos. Highly abundant autosomal genes in the endometrium were associated with biological processes such as facilitation of maternal recognition of pregnancy, trophoblast elongation and implantation (LGALS15, CST3, CST6, and EEF1A1). Several endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) including a novel ERV gene located in a reduced FecL locus potentially associated with sheep prolificacy were expressed in our dataset. Comparative transcriptome profiling of the endometrium having spherical and elongated embryos revealed distinct gene expression patterns. Genes that were upregulated in response to elongated embryos indicated the importance of immune system at the maternal-embryo interface prior to implantation.",

The genetic variation in such traits is caused by direct and maternal genetic effects (DGE and MGE, respectively). We used Willham’s variance-component approach and extended a family index with the focal individual and its full- and half-sibs to an approximated BLUP (pseudo-BLUP) by including the parents’ estimated breeding values. Most of the deviations of the predicted responses from the simulated ones were 4.1% for DGE and 5.3% for MGE. The benefits of index and BLUP selection are high in the case of negative correlation, large full-sib family and in particular, when maternal half-sibs are available. Higher economic value for MGE than for DGE is needed, since with equal heritabilities and economic weights for the effects the maternal response is 40 to 70% of the direct one. With negative correlation, records on collateral relatives beyond sibs are possibly needed. They would support also the prediction of MGE in uniparous reindeer lacking full-sib information.",

    "abstract": "The work is concerned with the diurnal and daily variations in the composition of cow faeces. Samples were taken from four dairy cows five times a day during the course of three days. The cows were fed on roughage and concentrates. The faecal samples were analysed for hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, crude protein, total ash and the ash soluble in 1N HCI. The following results were noted: Large variations occur in the composition of cow faeces. The largest variations relate to the cellulose, crude protein and total ash, whereas the content of lignin varies only little. Diurnal regularity was not noted. A close positive correlation was noted between the contents of hemicellulose and cellulose, as well as between the crude protein and the ash contents. A close negative correlation existed between both groups of carbohydrates and the crude protein, both carbohydrate groups and the ash, and between the crude protein and crude lignin. A high ash peak, attributable to sparingly soluble ash, was noted on several days. These ash-rich samples always have a high content of crude protein but a low content of carbohydrates. The digestibilities of the cellulose and crude protein were inversely related and varied during the same day of sampling within a range of as much as 12—13 percent units. The digestibility and rate of feed passage cannot be reliably evaluated by a grab sampling technique, at least not in instances when the cows are receiving both roughage and concentrates. As a possible reason for the variations it is suggested that the feed leaves the reticulorumen as different fractions. Shortly after the feeding, the material rich in concentrate moves on, whereas later mainly roughage material passes further into the alimentary tract. In the large intestines the former fraction results in a more intensive growth of bacteria, and the faeces originating from it contains a relatively higher proportion of bacterial matter.",

The experiment was conducted with the objective to evaluate the potential of the blend of homofermentative and hetero- and homofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as a rye silage additive. Early-cut rye (at boot stage, wilted) and whole-crop rye (at milk and soft dough stages of grain) were ensiled in laboratory mini-silos with (1) a blend of homofermentative LAB strains containing Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM26571), Enterococcus faecium (DSM22502), and Lactococcus lactis (NCIMB30117), (2) a blend of hetero- and homofermentative LAB strains containing Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM26571), Enterococcus faecium (DSM22502), and Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM22501), or (3) a blend of hetero- and homofermentative LAB strains containing Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM22501) and Lactococcus lactis (DSM11037).

After 60 days of fermentation at room temperature, mini-silos were opened, sampled for proximate analysis, forage hygiene, fermentation profile, and subjected to an aerobic stability (AS) test. Although the addition of homofermentative LAB strains was effective in reducing fermentation losses, it impaired the aerobic stability of rye silages. The combination of hetero- and homofermentative LAB strains was effective in reducing the aerobic deterioration of the rye silages by supporting a low pH value and inhibiting the proliferation of yeast and moulds.",

Experiment 1 included 3 primary growth grass silages (early, intermediate and late maturity stage) supplemented with three concentrate levels (9, 12 and 15 kg d-1). Experiment 2 included three consecutive harvests (first, second and third harvest from the same sward within the growing season) and three levels of concentrate supplementation (9, 11 and 13 kg d-1). Dairy cows responded clearly to changes in the harvesting time of silage in primary growth (quadratic effect) and amount of concentrate (linear effect) in the diet in Experiment 1. Milk yield was the lowest with third harvest silage in Experiment 2, and responses to increasing concentrate allowance were linear. Interactions between silage quality and concentrate supplementation were detected in Experiment 1, where milk production responses to additional concentrate decreased with increasing silage digestibility. No interactions were found in Experiment 2, probably due to the small range of differences in nutritional quality between the silages prepared from different harvests. The results demonstrated that it is difficult to compensate for low silage digestibility by increasing the amount of concentrate. The variable ECM response (from –0.01 to 0.85 kg ECM per kg DM incremental concentrate in the diet) is explained by the concomitant decrease in silage intake and negative effect on diet neutral detergent fibre digestibility.",

In order to enhance nutrient use efficiency the application should be adjusted according to the need of the cultivated crop. This task is challenging because weather is unknown and unpredictable over the upcoming growing season. One solution is site-specific fertilizer application in several separate events throughout the season. Such a precision fertilization method requires information on the current crop state (e.g. the availability of water and nutrients in the soil) and a crop growth model that aims to assess current crop growth and near future needs. A field experiment with varying radiation, precipitation and nutrient conditions was established to test our crop growth model performance. Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown using three fertilization rates with three precipitation and two radiation treatments within each fertilization treatment. The observed crop biomass accumulation in the highest fertilization treatment was considered as the highest possible in the prevailing conditions. The simulated (maximal) biomass accumulation was in agreement with the highest observed biomass yield. The results were found promising for further use of the model in crop growth evaluation during the growing season.",

In the investigation the random sampling method was used in such a manner that the above-mentioned questions were studied in one field compartment per each thousand hectares of cultivated land, the field compartments being determined by lot. The depth of the tilled layer was measured at a point at a distance of about one quarter of the length of the field compartment from its lower end. The soil samples for the determination of soil type and pH were also taken from the same spot. The soil type was determined on the basis of a sample taken from the subsoil; it was entered as mineral soil if the mud or peat layer had a thickness of not more than 30 cm. If clay soil contained humus in excess of 2 %, it was entered as muddy clay. Of the mineral soil types, clays are the most common soil types of the cultivated fields in southwestern and southern Finland. Parallel with the diminishing percentage of clay soil types towards the north, that of coarse graded soils and of organic soil types increases. Till soils are more common in the central parts of the country. The normal depth of the tilled layer in the whole country is 17.5 cm. In southern and southwestern Finland it is greater than in the other parts of the country. As a rule, the tilling is shallowest on till soils and deepest on clay soils. The acidity of the soil is less in southern and southwestern Finland than in the other parts of the country, judging by the samples from the tilled layer and by those from the subsoil. The organic soil types show a higher acidity than the mineral soils. In the mineral soils the acidity of tilled layer and subsoil is nearly the same, whereas in organic soils the acidity increases with increasing depth Acidity and relative content of finely divided soil fractions seem to be correlated in mineral soils. For instance, the normal acidity of the subsoil is 5.6 in coarse sand, 5.7 in fine sand, 5.8 in loam, 5.9 in silt and 6.0—6.1 in clay.",

The statistical dependence of plasma cholesterol content on the level of digestible crude protein in the ration has varied according to the circumstances showing a positive correlation in cows in normal condition and negative correlation in case of well conditioned cows. A temporary energy overfeeding or slight underfeeding have not shown any distinct effect upon the plasma cholesterol content. An increase in the degree of fatness appeares to increase the level of cholesterol in blood plasma appreciably. The age of cows (2—13 years) apparently does not affect the level of plasma cholesterol. The results obtained with barren cows differ from those obtained with normal cows.

Ylälehdet vaalenevat ennen alalehtiä kiertyen samalla ylöspäin. Värinmuutos alkaa lehden reunoista sekä suonien välistä. Lehdet sekä kukat ovat tavallista pienemmät ja kukkien väri vaalean keltainen. Hedelmänmuodostus saattaa hidastua, jolloin ne jäävät normaalia pienemmiksi ja mauttomiksi. Kasvien ravinnonottoon vaikuttaa mm. kalsiumin runsaus maassa. Kalium, natrium, magnesium, ammonium ja boori ovat antagonisteja kalsiumille, mikä merkitse, että kalsiumin otto häiriintyy, jos maassa on runsaasti mm. kaliumia tai magnesiumia. Runsas kalkitus puolestaan vaikeuttaa näiden sekä boorin ottoa. Kasvihuonekurkkua viljellään usein mullassa, jota on lannoitettu vuodesta toiseen ja jonka suolapitoisuus siitä syystä on korkea. Puutarhantutkimuslaitoksella todettiin v. 1957 suoritetuissa tutkimuksissa, että mullan korkea johtoluku sekä runsas kalin määrä vähentävät kalsiumin (Ca45) ottoa (taul., koejäsenet 1—3 ja 4). Myös magnesiumin lisääminen vähensi kasvien Ca-pitoisuutta. Koejäsenessä 4, jossa mullan johtoluku oli korkein, oli kasvien kasvu heikointa (kuva 1). Niissä ilmeni lisäksi kloroosia sekä lehtien reunojen kiertymistä, jollaista kurkulle voi aiheuttaa kalsiumin puute. Kalsium kerääntyy runsaimmin kasvin vanhimpiin lehtiin, joissa assimilaatio on vilkkainta, ja siirtyy niistä hitaasti kasvuvyöhykkeeseen ja nuoriin lehtiin (kuva 2). Autoradiogrammeissa, jotka tehtiin Ca45:ä saaneista kasveista, ilmeni, että kalsium kerääntyy kasvissa aluksi pisteiksi (kuva 3). Näitä oli lehden solukossa tiheämmässä kuin varressa ja lehtiruodissa, ja on ajateltavissa, että pisteet johtuvat oksalaatti-, malonaatti- tai muista kalsiumsuolakiteistä. Tämän mukaan näyttäisi kalsiumin eräänä tärkeänä tehtävänä kurkussa olevan hiilihydraattisynteesin yhteydessä kehittyvien haitallisten happojen neutraloiminen. Mikäli tätä ei tapahdu, voivat haitalliset aineet kulkeutua alalehdistä ylempiin ja aiheuttaa niissä kloroosia ja kasvun häiriintymistä.",

    "abstract": "Dairy cows have a highly valuable ability to convert grass into milk. A modification of the normal three-cut harvesting strategy was evaluated consisting of shortened first grass regrowth period to increase the energy value of the silage crop over the whole growing season under Boreal conditions. Grass was ensiled from timothy-meadow fescue-red clover swards over two years at three consecutive harvests within the growing season. Diets based on the silages (D1, 1st cut; D2, 2nd cut and D3, 3rd cut) were fed to dairy cows in two milk production experiments using change-over designs and an average concentrate proportion of 0.41 on dry matter basis. Consistently high energy value in silages was achieved and despite minor differences in silage D-values, feed intake was highest for D1. The differences in energy-corrected milk yield between treatments were limited to an increase for D2 in Exp 2 so that feed energy conversion into milk was decreased with D1. A shortened first regrowth interval for grass silage harvest was a viable option, but forage area per animal and other farm specific factors should be considered when choosing the silage harvesting strategy.",

The statistical model selection found that the predictors with the highest predictive power were growing degree days (GDD) in July and the number of days with rain (&gt;1mm) in June–July. These predictors together explained 43% of the variability in total DMY. Further, the prediction model was combined with a range of climate ensembles (RCP4.5) to project DMY of timothy for the decades 2050–2059 and 2090–2099 at 8 locations in Norway. Our projections forecast that DMY of today’s timothy varieties may decrease substantially in South-Eastern Norway, but increase in Northern Norway, by the middle of the century, due to increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.",

The retrospective reconstruction of the cases through documentation and interviews allowed for triangulation of data in a grounded theory approach. The leverage points of the developing collaborative processes were found to be; having agency and a network approach, the forming of collective agency through social learning, enhancing resource access, and operationalization of results. The concept of leverage points is useful for understanding evolutionary changes in multi-actor collaborations. The use of the concept of collective agency contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of demand articulation, illustrating a reciprocal process between the actors’ individual agencies, and evolving over time through their social learning. The results point to a need for policymakers and practitioners to develop a broader understanding of how actors work in the innovation system to enhance knowledge development and innovation.",

The results of the pelleting stability experiment showed that the commercial feed enzyme employed maintained most of its activity in conditioning temperatures up to 85°C.Furthermore, it became evident that measuring enzyme recovery in pelleted feeds by in-vitro assay methods underestimated the actual activity. For this purpose in-vivo models such as that based on gut viscosity measurements in broiler chickens gives a more accurate estimate. Gut viscosity also correlated highly with live weight gain (r2=0.624) and feed utilisation (r2=0.616) of broiler chickens. The in-vitro incubations using conditions similar to those of the GI tract showed that enzymes are not readily denatured and inactivated in such conditions and indicated that wheat and wheat gluten, and possibly similar feed ingredients, may help to maintain the activity longer either due to their buffering capacity or by providing substrates for the enzymes. This was supported by the results of the in-vivo measurements. In the stomach of pigs, 10-20per cent of the xylanase and β-glucanase activities added to the diets could still be recovered 4 hours after feeding. In the ileum, proportionally more added enzyme activities were recovered between 4 and 6 than 0 and 2 hours after feeding. In broiler chickens fed an enzyme-supplemented barley-based diet, β-glucanase was fully recovered in the proximal part of the small intestine, giving further proof of the stability of the enzymes employed to the conditions of the GI tract. When a mixture of fibre- and starch-degrading enzymes were added to a diet based on wheat and barley, β-glucan, starch and dry matter digestibilities were significantly (P",

The biogenic element concentrations of timothy were mostly unchanged or slightly decreased. The decreases were most probably due to differences in the weather conditions between the years and in the stage of development of the plants at the time of sampling. The decrease in timothy Zn was apparently caused by the decrease in soil Zn. In 1987, the mineral nutritive value of timothy as animal feed was nearly the same as in 1974, but lower than the recommendations valid today. In both years, the concentrations of harmful elements in timothy were low. A drastic decrease in Pb from 1974 to 1987 was due to a remarkable decrease in the Pb emissions from traffic into the atmosphere.

So far an input tax has been applied in Finnish agriculture.

The input quota was found to be the least-cost measure at the farm level when the marginal abatement costs of measures were compared on a grain farm growing barley.

Dietary cation-anion balance (DCAB), calculated as milliequivalents [(Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + S2-)] of the two diets was +410 mEq/kg of dietary dry matter (DM) in the high DCAB group and +81 mEq/kg of the dietary DM in the low DCAB group, respectively.

Blood and urine samples were collected 4, 3, 2 and 1 week before the expected calving date, at calving, the day after calving and 1 week following calving. Current data indicated that it may be difficult to formulate a diet with a negative DCAB, if the K content of grass silage is over 30 g/kg DM.

    "abstract": "The study comprises two experiments in which young Finn-sheep were used as test animals. The experimental rations consisted of equal parts of NaOH-treated wheat (Exp. 1) or barley (Exp. 2) straw and a concentrate mixture of barley-molassed beet pulp (Exp. 1) or barley-oats-molassed beet pulp (Exp.2). Feeding was performed twice a day. In addition 20 grams of urea/animal/day was mixed into the concentrates just before feeding. The urea was treated with the following percentages of formaldehyde, on a weight basis: 0 (F0), 1.0 (F1.0), 3.0(F3.0) and 5.0(F5.0) in Exp. 1 and 0, 1.0 and 1.5(F1.5) in Exp. 2. The digestibility of the total ration decreased, when F3.0 and F5.0 urea was used, but the decrease was significant (P&lt; 0.05) only when the apparent digestibility of crude protein was compared between the F0 and F5.0 diets. The amount of rumen bacteria was decreased (P&lt; 0.05) and the amount of protozoa increased (P&lt; 0.01) by formaldehyde treatment levels above F1.0 and F3.0, respectively. The concentration of the total VFA in the rumen tended to decrease with treatment levels higher than F3.0. No significant differences were found in the composition of the VFA. When treated urea was used, the excretion of nitrogen in the faeces increased but its excretion in the urine decreased. The percentage retention of the nitrogen ingested by the animals on diets F0, F1.0, F3.0, and F5.0 in Exp. 1 was 15.0, 10.8, 13.2 and 12.2 and on diets F0, F1.0 and F1.5 in Exp. 2 it was 20.5, 20.2 and 21.2, respectively.",

The results indicated that organic grain selenium affects the selenium levels of porcine tissues significantly more than sodium selenite supplementation of the same amount. The organic selenium concentrations of feed and organs were found to be linearly correlated. Spleen, lung and heart were the most reliable indicators of tissue selenium level in pigs. The selenium concentration of muscles of pigs fed on naturally seleniferous feed (270 µg Se/kg DM) was at the internationally level (500 µg Se/kg DM in meat), whereas the same amount of selenite in feed increased the selenium level of muscle only slightly (to 200/µg Se/kg DM). The histological structures of heart and muscle of pigs fed on naturally seleniferous feed were normal, whereas in the selenite group there were signs of muscle dystrophy when the selenium level was below 200 µg Se/kg DM. In addition, the pigs given selenite were subsequently placed in a lower, fat-containing carcass class. Feed with a natural organic selenium level of 150—200 µg Se/kg DM is preferred to selenite selenium supplement in pork production.",

Barley distillers by-products proved to have low feed values for pigs in this study, but the value for WDS was quite reasonable. The new integrated starch ethanol process can be expected to yield more suitable fractions for use in pig rations.",

    "abstract": "In two different experiments silages prepared with formaldehyde-containing additives were fed to cows with and without formaldehyde-treated urea, and formaldehyde was determined on both the silage and the milk. The silage additive contained 20 % HCHO and 30 % 80-% acetic acid and it was used at the rate of 5 l/ton raw material. The treatment levels of urea were 1.4-1.5 g HCHO/100 g urea. Twenty-two Friesian cows were used in Experiment 1 and 20 Ayrshire cows in Experiment 2. In Both experiments they were divided into two groups, one of which had silage as the only source of formaldehyde and the other both silage and HCHO-treated urea. Exp. 1 lasted 18 weeks and Exp. 2 13 weeks. The average daily milk yield in Exp. 1 was 14.2kg and in Exp. 2 it was 22.8kg FCM. When the experiments started at least 4monthshadelapsed from the preparation of the silages. In Exp. 1 the silage contained on average 13.0 mg HCHO/kg (10-16 mg/kg, n = 5) and in Exp. 2 it contained 64 mg HCHO/kg (45-90 mg/kg, n = 8). Judged by the fermentation criteria both silages were of good quality, but according to organoleptic tests the quality of the silage was better in Exp. 1 than in Exp. 2. In Exp. 1 the cows received HCHO from the silage at the average rate of 0.13 g/day and one group also received 2.01 g HCHO/day from the treated urea (altogether 2.14 g/day). Formaldehyde was found in the milk of four cows on the latter diet but in only one milk sample from three of them and in two samples from one. The HCHO content of these samples was 0.2-0.3 mg/l. In Exp.2 the cows in the two groups received HCHO from the silage at the average rates of 1.47g and 1.58g/day. In addition those in the latter group received 1.29g HCHO from the HCHO-urea (altogether 2.87g/day).The average formaldehyde content of the milk in the former group was 0.3mg/1(0-0.7mg/l) and in the HCHO-urea group 0.6mg/l(0.3-1.0mg/l). When the only source of formaldehyde was silage, there was a highly significant positive correlation between the HCHO content of the diet and that of milk, but when the cows received formaldehyde from both silage and HCHO-urea, the correlation was not significant. It thus appears that formaldehyde is transferred more easily to milk from silage than from HCHO treated urea.",

The soil reactions of a connected incubation test served to interpret the results obtained in the pot experiment. The experimental soils represented soil types of dissimilar responses to liming in regard to P availability. In the muddy fine sand (3 % of org. C), initially poor in easily soluble P, liming enhanced plant growth as well as P uptake in the second year. However, in spite of intensified P removal, the final content of water- soluble P in the limed soils was not lower than in the unlimed ones. This was assumed to demonstrate an augmented availability of P. Also in the fine sand soil (6.4 % of org. C), rich in water-soluble P, liming slightly improved growth of the second harvest in the pots not treated with P, but it did not affect P removal. In the pots amended with P, on the contrary, liming had no effect on the dry matter yields, but it tended to depress P withdrawal. Nevertheless, all the limed soils contained finally less water-soluble P than the unlimed ones, which suggests a diminished availability. The results of the pot experiment demonstrate that a relatively low soil pH does not necessarily limit growth of turnip rape, provided no nutrient deficiency or metal toxicity occurs.",

When the donor tissues of tansy were cultured under high light intensity the leaves contained anthocyanin and became brown during enzyme maceration. In contrast, donor tissues cultured under low light intensity produced leaves without anthocyanin. Depending on the light intensity of donor tissues, on average 5.8 - 6.8 x 106 and 3.4 - 4.3 x 106 protoplasts were isolated from one gram of mesophyll leaves of tansy and pyrethrum, respectively. In the second experiment, the production of protoplasts from tansy and pyrethrum varied seasonally. The most successful season for the production of protoplasts from in vitro cultured shoot tips was between December and April, when also the highest number of protoplasts could be isolated. It was not possible to state whether Tanacetum species have rhythms, which could cause physiological or chemical changes for the in vitro grown shoot tips. However, some external or internal, possible seasonal-dependent stimuli may have caused variation in the number of protoplasts isolated from tansy and pyrethrum and favoured protoplast production during winter and spring.",

The present review addresses sensory and hedonic characteristics in such foods, focusing on Finnish research around the issue. Fat mainly affects the texture of foods, but also modifies flavor and aroma. The replacement of fat by other constituents remains a challenge. Achieving salty taste with substances other than sodium chloride has proven to be unsuccessful, but proper flavoring can improve the pleasantness of reduced-salt foods. The impact of nutritional information and health claims is greater when given for new foods, and to consumers who are concerned about their health. Multi-item verbal instruments have been developed and validated to characterize health and taste orientations among consumers. Identification of sensory and hedonic barriers to the acceptance of healthful' alternatives among foods is important, even crucial, for targeting product development and nutritional counseling.;",

The most common pollen type was Brassicaceae pollen, which was represented by 60% of the grains counted. It was followed by Salix spp. (10%), Trifolium repens + T. hybridum (10%) and T. pratense + T. medium (6.5%) species. Pollen grains of Phacelia spp, Filipendula ulmaria, Apiaceae, Sorbus aucuparia, Malus domestica, and Rubus idaeus were also numerous. These pollen types constituted 96% of all the pollen examined. These results and those of the earlier pollen counts in Finland were compared with the cultivation areas of the most important nectariferous crops. In the 1930s white clover was the most important honey source in Finland and its pollen was very dominant in honey. Since the 1950s oilseed crops have been grown in increasing rates and pure timothy-meadow fescue pastures and hay stands with heavy N applications have decreased the share of Trifolium species. The proportion of Brassicaceae pollen has continuously increased with the increase of the growing area of turnip rape Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera and rape, B. napus ssp. oleifera. At the same time the proportion of T. repens + T. hybridum pollen has decreased so that their mutual relationships are now reversed compared to the beginning of the 1960s. Changes in land use were thus very clearly to be seen in the pollen content of honey.;",

Harvest index (HI) of barley and oat was set to 50%, and straw yields and whole crop cereal silage (WCCS) yields were generated from grain yields accordingly. The MEY in the third year of perennial grass (81.4 GJ/ha) was significantly lower than that in the first (90.0 GJ/ha) and second years (90.7 GJ/ha).

The MEYs of perennial and annual grass swards were substantially higher than the MEY of barley grain (52.7 GJ/ha) and oat grain (47. 8 GJ/ha). When the total herbage of cereals, i.e. straw and grain, was used in the calculations, at a ME value of 6.0 MJ/ kg dry matter (DM) for straw, the MEY of barley rose to 75.8 GJ/ha and that of oat to 72.6 GJ/ha. Additionally, the MEY of barley was estimated in the WCCS production situation by converting total herbage to MEY by using ME value 9.9 MJ/kg DM.

    "abstract": "Amendment of soil with peat is an attempt to avoid crop yield variation in the transition to conservation tillage, as it improves seedbed conditions and crop growth in drought-sensitive clay soils. Weed infestations were compared in 1999-2000 between the original and peat-amended clay (Typic Cryaquept, very fine, illitic or mixed) under different autumn tillage systems in an oats-barley rotation. In a field experiment, sphagnum peat (H = 4) had been spread (0.02 m 3 m -2 ) on the soil surface in August 1995. Tillage treatments included mouldboard ploughing (to 20 cm) and stubble cultivations of different working depths (8 or 15 cm) and intensity (once or twice). Weed biomass and density were assessed by an area of 1 m 2 per field plot in August 1999-2000 and June 2000. The 1999 season was dry, but soil moisture conditions were more favourable in 2000. Peat application tended to increase the number of volunteer oats and Chenopodium album in 1999, while decreasing Galium spurium biomass. Ploughing significantly increased the abundance of Chenopodium album and Lamium purpureum in barley (Hordeum vulgare) in 1999. Weed infestation was much lower in 2000, and tillage effect on Chenopodium album was minor in oats (Avena sativa). Growth of Lamium purpureum and Fumaria officinalis was stimulated in ploughed soils both years. Intensity and working depth of stubble cultivation had no significant effect on weeds.;",

    "abstract": "The effect of liming on the basic exchangeable cations in a sand, a heavy clay and a muddy clay soil was studied with a 9 month’s incubation experiment under laboratory conditions. Besides, observations were made in connection with some other incubation and field experiments. It was found that application of CaCO3 in amounts which reduced the acidity to about pH 7. decreased the content of exchangeable Mg in all experiments, and even a lower application effectively prevented any net release of nonexchangeable Mg which occurred in the muddy clay samples incubated without lime. Some fixation of K was also usually detected, but liming increased the amount of exchangeable Na. Essential differences apparently exist between the mechanisms of the retention of Mg and K induced by liming: Significantly lower amounts of Mg was extracted by 0.5 HCI from the limed samples of the heavy clay and muddy clay soil than from the original ones, while the contrary was true with K. The mechanisms connected with the Mg fixation were discussed. Attention was paid to the possibility that the usually poor Mg supporting ability of Finnish muddy clay soils may be partly connected with the heavy liming necessary for the cultivation of these acid soils.",

    "abstract": "The composition of meadow fescue and timothy was determined weekly during the first crop growth in two years and that of triploid red clover and couch grass in one year. The purpose was primarily to study at what growth stage these forages should be harvested for green meal, suitable to pigs and poultry. The recommended stage for harvesting is when the crop is 25—35 cm high (2-3 leaf stage) or 1 1/2—2 weeks before ear emergence. At this stage the crude protein content of grasses was, in the favourable spring, 24—28 %, and in the unfavourable spring, 16—21 % of dry matter. The pepsin solubility of protein was 80—85 % and the crude fibre content was below 20 %. Pepsin-HCI soluble organic matter was 50—53 % and in vitro soluble organic matter 80—82 % of dry matter. The quality of timothy deteriorated fastest and that of couch-grass slowest. The quality of red clover deteriorated much slower than that of the grasses; even three weeks after the meadow fescue was harvested the clover was still comparable to this in quality. In the unfavourable spring, the crude protein content of leaf stage grasses was 68 %-units lower, that of water soluble carbohydrates was as much higher, and the ash content about 2 %-units lower than in the favourable spring. During the most intensive growth the K-, Fe-, Mn- and Zn-contents of forages decreased sharply, and the P- and Ca-contents decreased slightly. The Mg-, Na- and Cu-contents were fairly constant during the whole growth period.",

    "abstract": "Peat is added to manure, because its low pH and capacity to adsorb ammonia (NH3) give it potential to reduce nitrogen (N) loss. Peat manure was prepared by mixing pig slurry with moderately humified Sphagnum peat. Less than 1% of applied ammoniacal N was volatilized as NH3 from peat manure and pig slurry within 8 h of surface application on clay loam soil according to JTI method. Incorporated manures showed even smaller N loss. The low volatilization was due to the adsorption of manure ammoniacal N by peat, and the infiltration of slurry into harrowed, moist clay soil. In another experiment, peat manure was applied on polypropylene fabric without soil contact. Within the first 3 days there was only 9% reduction in the ammoniacal N of peat manure, but the major part of it was lost during several weeks of dry and warm weather. Peat manure did not cause any major improvements on the growth and N uptake of spring barley in spring and early summer as compared with slurry. Moisture deficit limited the availability of ammoniacal N of manures. As compared with surface application, incorporation of manures increased nitrification of ammonium in the soil, and dry matter mass (1973%) and N uptake of barley. Supplementing manures with inorganic NPK fertilizer increased both dry matter mass (4098%) and N concentration of barley stand.;",

    "abstract": "In the iodine colorimetric method of Paloheimo gently dextrinized solutions are prepared of pure starch and of the analysis sample. One of the optical cells (A) of the comparator is provided with a solution made of pure starch and the other (B) with the solution to be analysed. Both solutions have the same iodine concentration. The solution in B must have a intensive colour than that in A. Solution B is then diluted with an iodinewater solution of the same iodine concentration as in the solutions A and B. When these solutions have attained the same colour it is concluded that also the starch concentration is the same and the starch content of the sample can be calculated. The results obtained by this method are compared with those obtained with the amyloglucosidase method of Salo. Table 1 shows that the two methods give very similar results. Different circumstances which might possibly interfere with the colorimetric starch determinations are studied. It was observed that attention must be paid to the intensity of boiling when the 0.05-N H2SO4 dextrinizing solutions are boiled. If the intensity is very different in the comparison solution and the solution to be analysed, considerable errors may occur. If the sample contains added chalk the neutralizing power of the sample should be determined beforehand and the normality of the solution adjusted to 0.05. If the sample contains acid it should be extracted beforehand with 80-% ethanol. —Cellulose and sugars have no influence on the results, nor have plant proteins or proteins of milk. However, if greater amounts of protein were added, a casein preparation intended for laboratory animals showed an obvious disturbing effect, as did gelatin and meat protein. – Faeces did not appear to have an interfering influence in colorimetric starch determination. The iodine colorimetric sensitiveness of starch solutions was also studied. It appeared that 0.18 mg of dextrinized potato starch already deepened the colour of 100 ml dilute iodine solution in room temperature. For wheat starch the corresponding minimum concentration was 0.27 mg/100 ml. In 3° the concentration limit was even lower, 0.05—0.09 mg/100 ml. In all the above mentioned studies the author has used as comparator essential parts of a Pulfrich photometer. A proper comparator (Fig. 1) can also be made by any skilled optician.",

    "abstract": "The effect of liming on the distribution of superphosphate phosphorus in various fractions of soil phosphorus was studied. Samples of four mineral soils (pH 3.9 to 5.1) were incubated at room temperature for eight months with 0, 0.5, or 1.0 per cent CaCO3, and with 0.40 per cent superphosphate or without any phosphate application. Liming increased the soil pH-values to pH 6.1—7.3. Samples were analyzed for inorganic phosphorus by the fractionation method of CHANG and JACKSON. Results obtained after an incubation period of four months showed that, both in the fertilized and unfertilized samples, liming had increased the fluoride soluble, acid soluble and easily soluble fractions, but it had decreased the alkali soluble phosphorus. These effects were generally the more distinct, the higher the application of CaCO3 had been. During the prolonged incubation, the alkali soluble fraction tended to increase at the expense of the fluoride soluble phosphorus. The differences in the phosphorus content of various fractions in the respective fertilized and unfertilized samples showed that the »superphosphate phosphorus» was mainly recovered as the fluoride soluble and alkali soluble forms, the relative amount of the latter being the lower the heavier the liming had been. Yet, even at about pH 7, from one fifth to one fourth of the applied phosphorus appeared to be sorbed by iron compounds and ocurred in the alkali soluble fraction. The sum of the proportions of easily soluble and fluoride soluble phosphorus increased with liming. The small parts of fertilizer phosphorus recovered in the acid soluble form did not depend on the rate of liming. Thus, even at pH 7, no significant turning of superphosphate phosphorus in difficultly soluble apatite like secondary calcium phosphates could be detected. The effect of liming on the availability of the fertilizer phosphorus and on the phosphate retention pattern of the soil, was discussed.",

Viimeiset nyt selostetuista havainnoista tehtiin keväällä 1965. Havaintotulokset osoittivat, että myös yleisesti kestävinä pidettyjen koristepuiden ja -pensaiden taimet ovat ensimmäisinä istuksen jälkeisinä talvina arkoja pakkasvaurioille. Kaikkein kestävimpinäkin pidetyistä pensaista vain Ribes alpinum selvisi kaikilla koepaikoilla vaurioitta. Hydrangea paniculata, Salix alba v. sericea, Juniperus chinensis (muodot ’Pfitzeriana’ ja ’Plumosa aurea’) J. virginiana ja Picea glauca ’Conica’ osoittautuivat selvästi aroiksi kaikilla koepaikoilla. Jyväskylässä ja Kauhajoella muita arempia olivat edellisten lisäksi Acer ginnala, A. tataricum, Berberis thunbergii ’Atropurpurea’, Chaenomeles japonica, Spiraea x vanhouttei, Syringa reflexa ja Viburnum opulus ’Roseum’. Rovaniemellä tyydyttävään kasvun alkuun päässeiksi voitiin kevääseen 1965 mennessä katsoa vain Acer ginnala, Berberis thunbergii, B. x ottawensis, Crataegus coccinea, Lonicera tatarica, Malus sargentii, Potentillat, Ribes alpinum, Spiraea hypericifolia, Syringa josikaea ja S. sweginzowii sekä samat havupensaat kuin Viikissä. Tehtyjen havaintojen perusteella niiden päivien lukumäärä, jolloin lämpötila oli alle —20° C, vaikutti selvemmin pakkasvaurioiden määrään – kuin useissa tapauksissa alle 30° C:n laskeneet – alhaisimmat todetut lämpötilat. Tämä tuli esiin varsinkin siellä, missä lumipeitteen suojaava vaikutus jäi vähäiseksi. Paikallisten olojen vaikutus kävi esille varsinkin Acer-lajien talvehtimisessa, joka oli epäyhtenäistä. Niin ikään kaikkein runsaimmaksi muodostuneet pakkasvauriot, talven 1962—1963 aikana Viikissä, osoittivat paikallisten olojen vaikutuksen talvehtimiseen. Tilia cordatan talvehtimisen epäonnistumista Jyväskylässä on myös pidettävä paikallisista oloista johtuneena.

An execessive intake of energy either has no statistically clear effect on the level of yield, or the effect is negative. In this respect the results obtained are uniform with experimental results obtained in Norway and Denmark using other methods (1, 6). In the negative cases the effect appears more clearly in the level of milk and milk fat yields than in the plasma cholesterol content. An excessive intake of protein shows a negative effect only in well-conditioned obese cows. An increase of the proportion of digestible crude fibre in the food ration appears in most cases to have an increasing effect on the milk yield. This effect, however, seems to be slighter than the effect on the blood plasma cholesterol content. The level of milk and milk fat yields has proved to be statistically in positive partial correlation to the digestible crude fat intake in g/kg live weight ,and in negative partial correlation to the relative fat intake compared with the nutritional requirements of the animal. This indicates that the favourable level of fat intake varies according to the level of milk yield, being larger in stages of higher yields than in stages of small yields.",

    "abstract": "Growth and respiration tests carried out on Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium molds have shown that certain amino acids such as 1-tryptophan and 1-cysteine and certain sulphydryl compounds such as glutathione and thioglycollic acid counteract the inhibitory action of hexamethylenetetramine. In the absence of hexamethylenetetramine, these compounds inhibit the growth of the molds. The dependence of the antagonistic action on the amino acid concentration differed for 1-cysteine and 1-tryptophan. The respiration of the mold was a maximum when equimolar concentrations of 1-cysteine and of the formaldehyde formed by the decomposition of hexamethylenetetramine were present in the culture media. The antagonistic effect of 1-tryptophan increased continuously with increasing concentration until the rate of oxygen consumption was the same as in the control test with no hexamethylenetetramine or antagonist present. The antagonistic effect of these four compounds on hexamethylenetetramine or on formaldehyde is evidently due to chemical interaction. The inhibitory effect of hexamethylenetetramine on the microbial cell may at least partly be due to its ability to inactivate enzymes such as the dehydrogenases.",

    "abstract": "Herneiden ja virnojen ravintoarvon selvittämiseksi on suoritettu maidontuotantokoe lehmillä sekä sulavuuskokeet pässeillä. Maidontuotantokokeessa käytetyissä virnajauhoissa (84.8 % kuiva-ainetta) oli 22.1 % sulavaa raakavalkuaista ja 1 ry:ä vastasi 1.08 kg, ja hernejauhossa (83.5 % kuiva-ainetta) 19.8 % sulavaa raakavalkuaista ja 1 ry:ä vastasi 1.07 kg (ry = 0.7 tärkkelysyksikköä). Skandinaavisen ry-järjestelmän (HANSSONin) mukaan laskettuna vastasi 1 ry:ä näillä rehuilla 1.02 kg. Maidontuotantokokeessa käytettiin virnaa 2.2–3.7 kg (keskim. 2.9 kg) ja hernettä 2.1—4.0 (keskim. 3.0 kg)/p eläintä kohti, eläinten tuotostasosta riippuen. Virnaa oli n. puolet ja hernettä hieman yli puolet koko väkirehujen ry-määrästä. Väkirehujen sulavan raakavalkuaisen määrästä oli virnan valkuaista 59 % ja herneen 55 %. Kaikkien rehujen ry-määrästä oli n. neljännes hernettä tai virnaa ja niiden sulavaraakavalkuaismääristä virnan valkuaista 43 % ja herneen 41 %. Lehmät söivät herne- ja virnajauhoa sisältävää väkirehuseosta mielellään. Kokeen aikana sattui 1 lievä puhaltumistapaus virnaryhmässä toiseksi eniten (3.6 kg/p) sitä saaneella lehmällä. Ruuansulatushäiriöitten vaara ei ole suuri ainakaan siinä tapauksessa, jos herne- ja virnajauhojen syöttö aloitetaan pienillä määrillä päiväannoksia vähitellen (5 p:nä) lisäten. Virnaa tai hernettä sisältävän koekauden 4 % - maidon määrä ei ole vähentynyt. Sensijaan maidon kokonaismäärä on vähentynyt, mutta rasvapitoisuus on kohonnut, mikä juuri aiheuttaa, että 4 % - maidon määrä ei ole vähentynyt. Normaalista poikkeavaa makua tai hajua ei voitu kokeen aikana havaita olevan maidossa. Koekauden elopainojen lisäys vastaa esikauden ja jälkikauden elopainojen lisäyksen keskiarvoa. Kokeissa käytetyt virna- ja hernemäärät olivat siksi suuria (keskim. n. puolet väkirehumääristä), että käytännössä sellaisilla määrillä (ja pienemmilläkin) päästään riittäviin valkuaismääriin, jos muiden kotoisten rehujen valkuaispitoisuus on normaalia tasoa vastaava. Sulavuuskokeiden tulokset osoittivat, että herne- ja virnajauhon sulavuus on sellainen, että ne voidaan lukea siinä suhteessa parhaimpien väkirehujen joukkoon. Herneen ja virnan viljeleminen puhdaskasvustoina on lakoutumisen vuoksi epävarmempaa kuin sekakasvustoina. Viljelyn epävarmuus ilmeisesti on aiheuttanut sen, että kauppavaatimukset täyttävän herneen ja virnan nykyinen hinta on siksi korkea, että sellaisen tavaran käyttöä lypsylehmien rehuksi ei voida ajatella. Seosviljelyssä (tavallisesti kauran kanssa) lakoutumisen vaara on pienempi, ja herne- ja virna tuleentuvat niissä aikaisemmin, joten niitä voidaan viljellä nykyistä pohjoisempana. Pyrittäessä kohottamaan kotovaraisten rehusatojen valkuaispitoisuutta on syytä kiinnittää huomiota virnan ja herneen seosviljelyyn, koska ne sisältävät runsaasti valkuaista ja ovat lypsykarjan ruokintaan hyvin soveltuvia rehuja.",

    "abstract": "From the viewpoint of the chemical properties of peats and of the cation uptake mechanism of plants the question has been considered to what extent it is possible to estimate the productivity after draining of a bog, using as a basis the luxuriance of the bog in its natural state and the richness in species of its calciphilous vegetation. The effect of draining upon the productivity of the peat has been studied from the viewpoint of the cation uptake mechanism of plants. The efficiency of this uptake has been thought to be determined by the electrical potential difference (E) between the boundary surfaces of the root and soil colloids: E = (RT/nF)*ln*([H+]root/[H+]soil) where [H+] stands for the activity of the respective hydrogen ions. In order that cation uptake of the plants should be possible, the hydrogen ion acitivity in the roots must exceed that in the soil, i.e., [H+]root/[H+]soil &gt; 1. When a bog is drained, [H+]root remains approximately unchanged, while [H+]soil soil increases for the reason that the quantity of soil colloids per unit volume increases owing to the removal of water. The potential difference between root and soil colloids will thus become less and the cation uptage of the plants will become impeded, the more the higher the efficiency of draining. The theory presented in this work has been shown to account for several phenomena observed in connection with the draining of bogs, particularly the changes in surface vegetation and the relations between the base content of the bog and its natural luxuriance. The higher the water content of a bog in its natural state, the lower is the base content of the peat with which it attains a given degree of luxuriance.",

The percentage of non-developed and fallen pods was on an average 21 and varied between 2 and 64. The mean percentage of non-developed and fallen pods was 5.5 and varied between 0 and 16 in the peas. The percentage of fully developed seeds was much smaller for the first ovule than for the central ones. The percentage of fully developed seeds was 70 in one material and the percentage of developed ovules (fully developed + defective seeds) in another material was 88.3. The corresponding percentages for the central seeds were 84 and 98.1, respectively, and for the last (outermost) seeds in the pods 82 and 91.1, respectively. The frequency of pods with only fully developed seeds was smaller for pods with a small number of seeds (ovules) per pod than for pods with a high number. The percentage of dead ovules was much higher for ovaries with a small number of ovules than for ovaries with a high number of ovules per ovary. The percentage of fully developed seeds showed a tendency to be higher for ovaries containing a large number of ovules than for ovaries containing a small number of ovules. Pod-setting percentage was much higher for the flowers with a low position (early) on the plant than for the flowers with a high position (late) on the stem. The difference was much larger than the corresponding one for the pea material. The length and breadth of the pods showed a tendency to be larger for low pods than for pods with a high position on the stem. Number of ovules per ovary showed a tendency to be higher for the lowest flowers than for the highest flowers. The difference was however much larger as to the fully developed seeds because the number of defective seeds was much higher for pods with a high position on the stem. Seed weight per pod was much larger for pods with a low position on the stem (early) than for pods with a high position on the stem (late). The mean seed weight showed about the same variation. Seed weight per pod for plants with a large number of pods per plant was smaller than for plants with a small number of pods per plant. The mean seed weight showed about the same variation. The number of fully developed seeds was somewhat larger for pods from nodes with two pods per node than for pods from nodes with only one pod per node. Seed weight per pod showed a tendency to be larger for pods from nodes with two pods per node than for pods from nodes with only one pod. Comparisons are in many cases made between vetches and peas, and, further, are the practical consequences of the obtained results discussed.",

The percentage of fully developed seeds has been smallest for the first seed in the pods on an average (61.0) and much larger for the central seeds (95.2). The corresponding percentage for the last (outermost) seed in each pod was intermediate (82.7). Of the not fully developed seeds, about a fourth part was not at all developed and classified as dead ovules. The relations between the two groups, defective seeds and dead ovules, showed no influence on the position of the seed in the pod. The percentage of pods with all seeds fully developed varied between 14 and 60, and was much dependent on the number of ovules per ovary. The percentage of pod-setting was higher for the low nodes than for the higher ones. The number of ovules per ovary and number of fully developed seeds per pod showed a small tendency to be higher for the lower pods on the stem than for the pods with a high position on the stem. Peduncle length was clearly higher for the lower pods than for the pods with a high position on the stem. Seed weight per pod was considerably higher for pods with a low position on the stem (early flowering) than for pods with a high position on the stem (late flowering) . The length and breadth of the pods, number of ovules per ovary and number of fully developed seeds per pod have on an average been larger for pods from nodes with only one or two pods per node than for pods from nodes with three or more pods per node.

    "abstract": "Tutkimus perustuu tiedusteluun, joka lähetettiin v. 1957 postitse n. 10 000:lle vähintään 2 peltohehtaaria käsittävälle viljelmälle. Nämä tilastoviljelmät on arvalla valittu Suomen kaikista viljelmistä vuodelta 1950 siten, että ne edustavat kaikkien eri maanviljelysseurojen alueita ja eri viljelmäsuuruusluokkia. Vastauksia saatiin 4 446 kpl. eli 44.2 % lähetettyjen tiedustelujen määrästä. Viljelmät on ryhmitelty peltoalan mukaan neljään suuruusluokkaan ja Suomi jaettu neljään tutkimusalueeseen, jotka olivat Etelä-alue (E), Keski-alue (K), Pohjois-alue (P) ja Lapin alue (L). Tulokset on esitetty näiden alueiden sekä koko maan keskiarvoina. Tutkimuksen mukaan nykyisen viljelijän ikä on koko maassa keskimäärin 51.3 vuotta. Maan pohjoisosassa ovat viljelijät 1—3 vuotta vanhempia kuin etelä-Suomessa. Yli 60-vuotiaita viljelijöitä oli koko maassa 27.0 % ja Lapin alueella 35.6 %. Nykyisen viljelijän jälkeen aiotaan koko maassa 85.4 % tiloista luovuttaa sukulaisille. Tilan myymistä suunnittelee 12.8 % E-alueen, mutta vain 7.1 % L-alueen viljelijöistä. Viljelemättä jättäminen tulee kysymykseen vajaalla prosentilla E-alueen viljelmistä. Määrä kohoaa pohjoista kohden ja Lapissa se on 3.3 %. Samalla kun viljelmien keskimääräinen koko pienenee etelä-Suomesta pohjoiseen päin, lisääntyy perillisten kesken jaettavien tilojen osuus 18.9 %:sta etelä-Suomessa 49.2 %:iin Lapissa. Viljelijäperheiden keskimääräinen lapsiluku koko maassa on 3.5 kpl. Lasten lukumäärä viljelmää kohden kasvaa siirryttäessä etelästä pohjoiseen. Lapissa se on 2.1 kpl. enemmän kuin etelä-Suomessa. Viljelijäperheiden lasten kokonaismäärästä on E-alueella 23.3 % sellaisia lapsia, joiden koulunkäynti on rajoittunut kansakoulun suorittamiseen. Pohjoiseen päin mentäessä vastaava luku lisääntyy. Lapissa se on 35.9 %. Useimpien ammattikoulujen sekä oppikoulun suorittaminen, samoin opiskelu yliopistossa on P-alueella vähemmän yleistä kuin muualla. Oppikoulussa oli tiedusteluhetkellä 8.8 % maan eteläosan viljelijäperheiden lapsista. P-alueella oli vastaava luku 4.1 %. Yliopistossa tai muussa korkeakoulussa opiskelevia tai niissä tutkinnon suorittaneita oli E-alueella 3.6 % ja P-alueella 1.3 % viljelijäperheiden lapsista. Tiloja, joilla toimi koulunsa tai opintonsa päättäneitä lapsia maataloudessa tai siihen liittyvässä kotitaloudessa, oli E-alueella 55.1 %, K-alueella 60.9 %, P-alueella 69.9 %, L-alueella 60.4 % ja koko maassa 60.7 % tilojen kokonaismäärästä. Tutkimuksessa on lisäksi selvitetty niiden perheiden määrät, joiden lapsia on muualla maatalouden palveluksessa (keskim. 4.1 %) sekä tapaukset, joissa joku koulussa olevista aikoo jäädä maatalouden palvelukseen (keskim. 13.7 %). Edellä mainitut ryhmät yhteensä osoittavat, kuinka suuri osa tiloista korkeintaan tulee säilymään nykyiseen viljelijäperheeseen kuuluvan hallussa seuraavan sukupolven aikana. Kotoa siirtyneiden lasten osuus on P-alueella noin 17 % ja muualla noin 20 % koko lapsimäärästä. E-alueella toimii 17.3 % ja muilla alueilla runsas neljäsosa siirtyneiden lasten määrästä muualla maa- tai metsätalouden palveluksessa. Viljelijöiden käsityksen mukaan tärkein syy maaltapakoon on maatalouden huono kannattavuus. Verraten yleisiä syitä ovat myös haluttomuus tilan jakamiseen sekä sivuansioiden puute.",

V. 1957 oli tuhoutuneiden kaurojen väritys heikosti kellanruskea ja versominen vähäinen sekä sato parempi edelliseen vuoteen verrattuna. Tuhoeläintutkimuslaitoksen tutkimusten sekä viljelijöiltä saatujen tietojen mukaan on uusien kaurantuhopaikkojen määrä vuoden 1955 jälkeen vähentynyt ja tuhon voimakkuudessa on vuoden 1955 jälkeen tapahtunut lievenemistä niin, että tuho oli vv. 1957 ja 1958 vaikeasti havaittavaa. Tuhon voimakkuus vaihtelee esiintymisalueellaan samana vuonna melkoisesti, johtuen ilmeisesti viljakaskaan lisääntymis-, säilymis- ja aikuistumispaikkojen määrästä eli etenkin suojaviljaan perustettujen 1.-vuoden heinänurmien osuudesta koko viljakasvialasta. Vuodesta 1955 lähtien tapahtunut tuhon voimakkuuden väheneminen johtunee 1) viljakaskaan populatiotiheydessä tapahtuneesta laskusta ja 2) tuhon ilmenemiseen vaikuttavista ulkoisista tekijöistä mm. kosteudesta ja lämmöstä. Kaurantuhon satoa alentava ja pellon käyttöä muuttava vaikutus ilmenee Pohjanmaan maanviljelysseurojen sekä ko. alueen kirjanpitotilojen sato- ja viljelyalatilastoissa. Österbottens svenska lantbrukssällskap'in alueella oli kauranviljelyala v. 1956 vain 1/6 v. 1954 alasta ja saman alueen kirjanpitotiloilla on kauran viljely lopetettu kokonaan. Viljelijät ovat kauranviljelyn lopetettuaan tai sitä vähennettyään siirtyneet joko seosviljan kautta tai suoraan ohran viljelyyn sekä laajentaneet täyskesantoalaansa. Vuosina 1957 ja -58 saadut hyvät kaurasadot vaikuttanevat kauranviljelyalan palaamiseen lähes ennalleen, ellei voimakasta tuhoa esiinny lähi vuosina. Kaurantuhon esiintymisessä on havaittavissa selvä yleistyminen vuodesta 1948 vuoteen 1955, jonka jälkeen tuho vuoteen 1958 mennessä näyttää melkoisesti lieventyneen ja lähes kadonneen.

    "abstract": "Three experiments have been carried out with altogether 16 Ayrshire calves in order to determine the digestibility of timothy hay cured at the early flowering stage and containing some red clover. The ages of the calves varied from 2 ½ to 9 months. Hay was given either totally or almost ad lib. Lignin was used as tracer. In experiment 1 the ages of the six experimental calves varied from 3 to 9 months. The calves aged 5—9 months digested hay equally efficiently when com-pared with each other. The youngest calf aged 3 months digested hay less efficiently (Table 1). In Experiment 2 the ages of the six experimental calves varied from 10 to 22 weeks. In the trial two control cows were also included. The calves aged 10—12 weeks digested hay less efficiently and the calves aged 4—5 months almost as efficiently as the control cows (Table 2). The ability of calves of the same age to digest hay was quite variable. Experiment 3 was carried out with four 7 months old calves. At the end of the trial the calves were slaughtered and the contents of the different parts of the digestive tract were weighed and sampled. On the ground of the analyses of the hay, the contents of the abomasum and the faeces, the digestibilities of N-free organic matter and N-free non-lignin organic matter in the proventriculi and in the whole digestive tract were esimated. The share of the proventriculi in the total digestibility of the said substances was 82—88 per cent (Table 3). The contents of the reticulo-rumen of the calves in Experiment 3 as well as those of younger calves aged 3 ½—4 months were weighed in connection with the slaughtering. The quantity of the contents in calves of 7 months was 30—40 kg and that in calves aged 3 ½—4 months 12—15 kg.",

    "abstract": "In 1990 the organizations responsible for Finnish dairy breeding established an open nucleus multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) breeding program called ASMO. The aim was, besides to test effectiveness of MOET, to improve the protein to fat ratio in milk produced by Finnish Ayrshires but without sacrificing the progress in protein yield. The relative weights of traits were such that equal importance was assigned to protein % and protein yield. Negative weight was assigned to fat % to ensure it remained unaltered. The MOET work continued until 1994 after which the performance of selected animals has been monitored. During the five years the scheme operated, 276 cows were flushed for embryos, and 2751 embryos were recovered, of which 1810 were transferable. More than 1600 embryos were transferred to recipients, and 813 calves were born. Eighty bull calves were sold for the artificial insemination test scheme. In December 1995 the first 125 ET daughters were evaluated with the national animal model program. Their mean estimated breeding values (EBVs) were +0.13 for protein % and -0.18 for fat % compared with the genetic base of progeny tested sires born in 1986-1988, and the protein yield EBVs were 12 kg above the genetic base. Despite the efficiency of selection, the program was discontinued in 1994. Due to the difficulty of maintaining sufficient control over donor animals, there were fewer than expected embryos per flush and also too few flushes per donor.",

A pot experiment was carried out on clay, loam and organogenic soils to find out the effect of Na application (0, 200 or 400 mg dm-3 of soil, one application) on the concentration of Na, K, Ca and Mg of timothy and the effect of K fertilization (0, 100 and 200 mg dm-3 for each three harvests) on the efficiency of Na application. Added Na elevated the Na concentration in all harvests on all soils. The magnitude of the effect (organogenic soils≥loam&gt;clay) was opposite to the K supplying power of the soil. Potassium fertilization suppressed the effect of Na application substantially and Na concentration was elevated remarkably only when the K concentration of the plants fell to or below the deficiency level (approximately 15 g kg-1). According to a cation exchange experiment, nearly all added Na remained in the soil solution. Still, the apparent utilization of added Na remained below 4% on all soils, demonstrating the natrophobic nature of timothy. Sodium fertilization of timothy seems to be an ineffective way of increasing the Na content of forage at least on soils of a good K status or when applied with ample K fertilization.",

Grain yield of 12 oat lines (released since 1959) was compared with that of the check lines. The effect of differences in May-June precipitation on grain yield was established for different lines. Greenhouse experiments included 19 oat lines (released since 1921) and three wild species of oat (A. barbata L., A. sterilis max. L. and A. fatua L.). The data from greenhouse experiments were analysed using discriminant analysis in groups of old (released before 1970s), modern, and wild oat types. Ranking of the oat lines according to results from long-term field trials and greenhouse experiments was not consistent; contrary to the field experiments, the old lines tended to be the most drought sensitive when tested in the greenhouse. Therefore, the simple and non-laborious methods used in this study for ranking of drought sensitivity of oat lines are not recommended.",

A group separation method based on ion exchange chromatography was found suitable for isolating and purifying amines and amino acids in biological samples. Quality was evaluated in samples fermented with different starter cultures, inoculation sizes and substrate levels. Slow or incomplete fermentation led to the accumulation of biogenic amines, especially tyramine, and resulted in a low QI. Fast initial and continuous stable fermentation for four weeks resulted in low concentrations of biogenic amines and high concentrations of free amino acids and consequently a high QI. The alanine concentration was considered to be a useful tool for estimating proteolysis, and QI related to changes in alanine concentration, lactic acid production and redox potential were considered to give the most useful estimation of the biological quality of fermented fish offal and poultry waste.",

After the second harvest one replicate of each strain under the three light regimes was placed at +4°C under an 8-h light regime at 10 klux for 26 days. For assessment of plant response to hardening conditions, chemical analyses were performed on roots for TNC, long-chain fatty acids and proline. The study showed that the adaptation of red clover to certain daylength conditions influences plant behaviour with respect to its growth, development and hardening.

The frequency of ewes with supernumerary teats (ST) in Finnsheep and Coopworth was ca. 20 %. The frequency of six-teated animals increased with selection for teat number. In Finland, about ½ of the 4-teated ewes had milk-yielding STs. Six-teated ewes in N.Z. gave 30—40 % of their daily milk from the STs. The N.Z. Coopworths seemed to have a »multiple lamb image»; multiple lambs tended to be closely bonded and sucked together, leading to higher success rates than when sucking individually. Heritability of teat number in N.Z. was 0.6. The lengths of STs were more variable than those of main teats, and their mean length ca. half of that of main teats. The average distance of STs from the main teats in Finnish trials was ca. 20 mm (range 1—50mm); the length and separation of teat pairs were correlated, although this was not the case in several flocks studied in Ireland.",

Local populations maturing early were frequently used in crosses with foreign material. Strains from the ICARDA collection and Soviet varieties included in the crosses considerably increased the genetic basis of the breeding material. Some 214 crosses were made in 1970—87. Two commercial varieties, Hankkijan Mikko and Hankkijan Ukko, were released during the course of the programme. They were about two weeks earlier in maturing than, e.g. the German variety Herz Freya. Crosses and selections of current interest are aimed at reaching still earlier maturity than that of Mikko and Ukko. Determinate habit with ti gene has been transferred to locally adapted early material in order to attain lines with reduced vegetative growth,uniform ripening and improved lodging resistance. The white-flowered character is combined with earliness and determinate habit in order to obtain a lowered tannin content in seeds.",

Preliminary field surveys showed that D is early maturing, prolific and aseasonal. Hence, a multidisciplinary research programme on D was started in 1974. This paper reports the findings of these studies and describes the approach used to (1) characterize and evaluate the performances of D in field and station, (2) study the physiological mechanism involved in its peculiar reproduction and production, (3) study the genetic basis of reproduction parameters, and (4) evaluate use of D in crossbreeding schemes to improve the productivity of other Moroccoan breeds. Results show that D is one of the rare breeds that is simultaneously early maturing, highly prolific and completely aseasonal. However, studies on water turnover and nitrogen recycling show that D is not well adapted to hot climate and poor nutrition. Its reproduction parameters are relatively independent of photoperiod and related to a low sensitivity to negative oestrogen feedback. D male is characterized by high libido and can be used for synchronizing oestruses through the »ram effect». Crossbreeding experiments with non-prolific sheep confirm the heritability of reproductive parameters. However, the genetic basis for these is not yet well known.",

The fruit yields ranged from 790 to 1900 kg/ha in loamy soil in Helsinki, and from 120 to 390 kg/ha in crusted silt soil in Kangasala. There were no significant differences between the yields of different cultivars in any single trial, despite the considerable annual variation. The amount of volatile oils in the fruit ranged from 0.34 to 1.49 ml/100 g and the proportion of the main compound, linalool, was 48.7—72.7 %.The small-fruited cultivars(‘Hungarian’ I and It, ‘Lucs’) had a higher oil content than those with larger fruits(‘Kultive’, ‘Coriander’ LD) but growth period of the small-fruited cultivars was too long for cultivation in the climatic conditions of the Nordic countries.",

The sugar yield was higher in plots with the normal pesticide doses than in the control plots. The overdoses increased neither the sugar beet yields nor the sugar yields as compared to the normal plots. The soil microorganisms were affected by pesticides in some but not in all cases.

    "abstract": "The main problems encountered in breeding winter rye in the northwestern region are: winterhardiness, lodging resistance, disease resistance and grain quality. Winterhardiness in the northwest of the USSR depends on the resistance of rye to snow mould. Varieties from the USSR (Vyatka, Falenskaja, Udinskaja, Narymskaja 23 and some others) and Austria (Lungauer Tauern, Schlager) as well as many varieties from Finland present valuable material for breeding for winterhardiness. The breeding of short-strawed varieties was promoted considerably by the use of donors with the dominant type of inheritance of the short straw characteristic (EM-1, k-10028) and many forms and varieties created on their basis. Nine commercial varieties with a high yield potential and winterhardiness were bred. Short-strawed donors resistant to powdery mildew and brown rust (Imering 4, Fletera 2, Immunnaja 5), unique in their kind and very valuable, were bred by introgression of the genes for resistance, which had been discovered in the populations of wild species and older varieties. A strategy of breeding rye for disease resistance is suggested. In breeding to improve grain quality, a gene bank of varieties, in which the stability of high grain quality is retained, is valuable. Some varieties have a protein content in the grain of 10 %, with a lysine content in the protein of 4 % or more (Marienhofer, Wieselburger, Kisvardai). Four short-strawed analogues of commercial varieties (Ural’skaja HI, Tchishminskaja HI, Kustro HI, Stalrug HI) are close to the variety Otello as to their baking qualities. The material presented on the inheritance of characteristics contributes to the selection of donors when new varieties are bred.",

Clay content is an important soil characteristic, because it is associated with other soil properties that are important in management. Soil survey data from 150 sampling sites taken from an area of 218 ha were used to predict the spatial variation of clay percentage geostatistically in an agricultural soil in Jokioinen, Finland. The exponential and spherical models with a nugget component were fitted to the experimental variogram. This indicated that the medium-range pattern could be modelled, but the short-range variation could not, due to sparsity of sample points at short distances. The effect of sampling density on the kriging error was evaluated using the random simulation method. Kriging with a spherical model produced a map with smooth variation in clay percentage. The standard error of kriging estimates decreased only slightly when the density of samples was increased. The predictions were divided into three classes based on the clay percentage. Areas with clay content below 30%, between 30% and 60% and over 60% belong to non-clay, clay and heavy clay zones, respectively. With additional information from the soil samples on the contents of nutrients and organic matter these areas can serve as agricultural management zones.;",

    "abstract": "Tärkeimpiä peltokasvien talvehtimisvaurioiden aiheuttajia ovat maassamme talvituhosienet. Toisella sijalla vaurioiden aiheuttajana on pakkanen, joka tuhoaa kasveja syystalvella, talvella ja keväällä, jollei niillä ole lumen suojaa. Näin tapahtuu myös silloin, kun vesi jäätyy lumettoman maan pinnalle kattojääksi, joka läpäisee pakkasen. Pakkasille altteimpia ovat syysvehnä, apilat ja syysrypsi. Tuhosienten ja pakkasen aiheuttamia vahinkoja vähäisempiä ovat roustevauriot, vesivauriot ja tukehtumisvauriot. Viimeksimainitut johtuvat hapen puutteesta silloin, kun kasvit joutuvat olemaan lumipeitteen alla sulassa maassa. Kotimaiset syysruislajikkeet talvehtivat suurimmassa osassa maata hyvin tai sangen tyydyttävästi. Perä-Pohjolassa ja Lapissa ei syysruis menesty usein tapahtuvien tuhosienivaurioiden vuoksi lumen pysyessä keväällä pitkään maassa. Myös muilla seuduilla, jos maalis-huhtikuussa on runsaasti lunta, voivat tuhosienet tehdä joinakin vuosina huomattavia vahinkoja. Syysviljojen siemenen peittaus on lumihomesienen vaurioiden vähentäjänä tarpeellinen toimenpide. Vähälumisilla seuduilla aiheuttavat syystalvi- ja kevätpakkaset toisinaan syysrukiissa vaurioita. Syysvehnä talvehtii maamme lounais- ja eteläosissa hyvin ilman suuria talvehtimisvaurioita. Kymenlaakson koeaseman alueella ovat talvehtimisvauriot olleet vaikeuttamassa syysvehnän viljelyä. Kun syysvehnän viljelyä on pyritty laajentamaan pohjoiseen päin, ovat runsaslumisilla alueilla tulleet esteeksi talvituhosienivauriot. Keski-Pohjanmaalla ja Pohjois-Pohjanmaalla ei syysvehnä ole menestynyt pakkasvaurioiden vuoksi. Jos runsaslumisilla seuduilla halutaan viljellä menestyksellisesti syysvehnää, varsinkin talvituhosienille alttiita lajikkeita, kannattaa turvautua syksyisin oraiden fungisidikäsittelyihin. Nurmiheinät talvehtivat etelä- ja keskiosissa maata suurimmaksi osaksi moitteettomasti. Sen sijaan tärkeimmän peltokasvin, timotein viljelyvarmuutta heikentävät Pohjois-Suomessa talvituhosienien (pohjolan pahkasienen, pahkulasienien ja lumihomesienen) usein toistuvat vahingot. Lapin koeasemalla oli 27:n vuodenaikana suoritetuissa timoteinlajikekokeissa 12:na vuonna sellaisia kokeita, jolloin sienet olivat tuhonneet kasvuston. Timotein talvehtimisen tutkiminen olisi Pohjois-Suomessa ulotettava käsittämään koko sen alueen, jossa kasvia viljellään. Eri puolille Lappia olisi järjestettävä runsaasti ja pitemmän ajan kuluessa kasvustojen fungisidikäsittelykokeita. Ne osoittaisivat millaisissa olosuhteissa talvehtimisvaurioita esiintyy ja mitkä ovat niiden aiheuttajat samalla, kun ne selvittäisivät mihin toimenpiteisiin olisi ryhdyttävä talvehtimisvahinkojen estämiseksi. Eri koepaikoissa tehdyissä puna-apilan lajikekokeissa oli joka kolmas koe talvehtinut huonosti apilamädän tuhojen ja pakkasvaurioiden vuoksi. Viljelijät ovat monissa tapauksissa luopuneet apilan viljelystä sen huonon talvehtimisen tähden ja siirtyneet nurmiheinien viljelyyn, kun taas monilla seuduilla viljellään edelleen menestyksellisesti tätä arvokasta rehukasvia. Kun ryhdyttiin kokeilemaan tetraploidiapilalajikkeilla, todettiin niiden kestävän paremmin apilamätää vastaan kuin diploidiapilat. Myöhemmissä kokeissa olivat myös tetradloidiapilat samalla tavoin alttiita taudille kuin diploidiapilat. Tämä on ilmeisesti johtunut siitä, että koepaikoissa lisääntyivät vähitellen tetraploidiapiloille aggressiiviset apilamätäsienen rodut eli tyypit, jolloin nämäkin lajikkeet kävivät alttiiksi taudille. Tiloilla, joilla apilamätä aiheuttaa usein vahinkoja, on syytä harkita kannattaako ryhtyä suorittamaan kasvustojen käsittelyjä syksyisin fungisideilla. Syysrypsin viljely olisi ollut maassamme useasti toistuvien talvehtimisvaurioiden (talvituhosieni-, vesi- ja pakkasvauriot) vuoksi hyvin epävarmaa, ellei pelloissa olisi keväällä mahdollista ilman suuria kustannuksia vaihtaa kasvilajia.",

The silages and the ensiling methods were: 0.5 % urea per fresh weight (A), 1.0 % urea per fresh weight + Viher-acid 4 1/1000 kg of silage (B), 0.5 % urea per fresh weight + Viher-acid 4 1/1000 kg of silage (C). Viher-acid 4 1/1000 kg of silage (D) and silage without urea or preservatives (E). The dry matter content of the whole maize was 21 % and the crude protein content was 10.8 % in DM. The addition of urea increased the crude protein (N x 6.25) content in A- and C-silages to 17.7 percent and in B-silage to 24.9 percent. The quality of the silages was good, and some marks of butyric acid was found only in the silage ensiled without Viher-acid or urea. The addition of Viher-acid lowered the fermentation rate so that the sugar content of the corresponding silages was higher. The sugar content was higher (P &lt; 0.01) and the content of lactic acid lower (P &lt; 0.001) in the silage ensiled only with Viher-acid. Urea increased the content of lactic acid and the content of acetic acid of the silages. In the silages ensiled with urea the use of Viher-acid tended to lower the fermentation rate. The use of urea increased the NH3-N (P &lt; 0.05) and the soluble N contents (P &lt; 0.001) in the silages. In spite of the low dry matter content of the silages some enrichment of the urea in the lower parts of the silos was only found in the silage ensiled with 1 % of urea (P &gt; 0.05) and Viher-acid. This was due to the larger effluent amount from the silo. The fermentation losses of dry matter were smallest in the silage D (3.9 %) and highest in the silage E (11.6 %) (P &lt; 0.05). The losses in A-, B- and C-silages were 7.6 %, 4.7 % and 9.2 %, respectively. The use of urea decreased the fermentation losses.",

During three seasons the magnesium fertilization did not affect the grain or the straw yield, the weight of the grain, or the rate of maturing in the first year. After the magnesium reserve had been exhausted the annual magnesium fertilization was needed to satisfy the requirements of an abundant crop. The highest level of potassium application together with a double magnesium fertilization rate caused a slight decrease in the yield, as the amount of water soluble salts in the growth base reached a high value. A deficiency in magnesium impeded more strongly the development of the grain crop than that of the straw crop; the maturing of the crop was delayed, and the grains were small. The ratio of potassium to magnesium in the annually renewed fertilization, when both nutrients were being used, did not affect the yield of oats. The amount of nutrients used had a more important significance than the ratio of the nutrients. Increase in the amounts of potassium, lime or nitrogen each had a diminishing effect on the yield if the plants were suffering from a deficiency of magnesium. Together with magnesium these treatments increased both the grain and the straw yields. Without the magnesium fertilization the highest rate of potassium increased clearly the value of the ratio K/Mg in the growth base, and caused a decrease in the yield.",

The material consisted of 158 children aged 5, 9 and 13 years living in Nurmijärvi. Food consumption was measured by the 24-hour recall method and the nutrient intakes were calculated on the basis of food composition tables. The interviews were made in June and the following January and February. The diet in winter included significantly more fruits and berries, inner organs and blood but less vegetables and milk products other than milk, sour milk or cheese. The differences were the same in all age groups. The intakes of energy and nutrients were notably similar in summer and in winter. Only the intakes of iron, vitamin A and ascorbic acid were higher in winter than in summer. This can be ascribed to the high consumption of inner organs and blood. The large consumption of fruits, citrus fruits in particular, raised the ascorbic acid intake to a quite high level in winter. The differences in the present study between the diets of the children in summer and winter were not similar to those observed earlier among Finnish adults. The increased use of imported foodstuffs and the development of the domestic food industry have obviously levelled off the sharp seasonal fluctuations earlier seen in the Finnish diet.",

The 25-cm-high columns of three soils, (A – fine sand, B - loam, C - clay loam), placed in plastic tubes were treated with deionized water (pH 6) and with three solutions (pH 5, pH 4, pH 3) of sulphuric acid. The washed out were determined in the leachates collected into plastic bags. The largest amount of nitrogen found in the leachates was in the form of nitrate and this was proportional to the content of organic matter in the soils. The leached amount of NH4-N was considerably lower and like potassium it was negatively dependent upon the clay content in the soils. The concentrations of K, Ca and Mg in the leachates rose in relation to the declining pH of percolating solutions. Especially in soil A, acid solutions of pH 5 (and lower) washed out very effectively the cations. Soils Band C (with a higher content of clay particles) showed a higher resistance to K, Ca and Mg leaching. The acidified water influenced even the pH of the surface layer (0—7,5 cm) of soils in the columns. The most marked decrease in pH values was found in soil A after an application of the solution with pH 3. A decrease in the content of basic cations (Ca and Mg) was parallel to the acidification of the upper layer of the soils.",

Lipids and fatty acids of the roe were investigated in detail. Perch roe was processed using chemical preservatives, sugar, salt, and freezing and changes in the quality of the products were followed by chemical and sensory analyses during a one-year cold- and frozen-storage period. Mature roe as roe bags contained 13 % protein, 4 % fat and 1 % ash on wet weight basis. The amounts of protein and ash decreased somewhat when the roe was screened. The major lipids in perch roe were sterol and wax esters composing about 80 % of the total lipids. Polyenoic acids with dominant docosahexaenoic acid composed about half of the fatty acids in neutral lipids whereas saturated acids dominated in phospholipids. Frozen, washed roe was better in its quality during the one-year storage time as compared to heavy-salted, cold-stored roe containing preservatives which, in turn, was preferred to the light-salted, frozen roe or sugar-salted, cold-stored roe.",

The nitrogen fertilization (from 50 to 156 kg/ha N) was given in the form of ammonium nitrate limestone, and the potassium (42—179 kg/ha K) in potassium sulphate. The nitrogen fertilization affected significantly both the yield and the quality of the tubers. The maximum tuber yield was achieved at the nitrogen application rate of 110 kg/ha. The economically most advantageous fertilization rate was 80 kg of nitrogen per hectare, if only the amount of the yield was taken into account. The nitrogen fertilization weakened the quality of the tubers. The weight and the size of the tubers increased, but the starch content of the tubers decreased as a result of the nitrogen fertilization. The starch yield also turned out to be the smallest at the heaviest nitrogen fertilization. Further, the biggest rate of nitrogen weakened the flavor of the tubers, depressed their mealiness, and increased slightly their discoloration when raw. The fertilization had no effect on the darkening of cooked potatoes. In these one-year experiments, the increase of the potassium fertilization from 42 kg/ha K did not have a significant effect on the yield and the quality of the tubers.",

The estimates of the production frontier are used to analyze nitrogen and phosphorous productivity and efficiency differences between soils and crops. For this input specific efficiencies are calculated. The results can be used to recognize relations between fertilizer management and soil types as well as to learn where certain soil types and crop combinations require special attention to fertilization strategy. The combination of inputs as designed by the experiment shows significant inefficiencies for both N and P. The measures of mineral productivity and efficiency indicate that clay is the most mineral efficient and productive soil while silt and organic soils are the least efficient and productive soils. Furthermore, a positive correlation is found between mineral productivity and efficiency. The results indicate that substantial technical efficiency differences between different experiments prevail.;",

The final hydrolysis residue from the carbohydrate hydrolysis is considered as lignin. Furthermore, crude fat, crude protein, ash, and in cold water soluble N-free non-carbohydrate organic matter are determined. The total of the results of the analyses appears to be approximately 100 %. In an alternative system used by the author, mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides and fructosan are determined as a group. The results are compared with those obtained by fractionation. The sugar solutions have been purified and neutralised with ion-exchange resins using the bath-method. Duolite A-7 and Duolite C-3 have been found to be suitable for these purposes in experiments which were made with pure solutions of individual sugars. The purity of different fractions of carbohydrates has been checked by paper chromatography. Also the proportions of individual monosaccharides in a hemicellulose fraction for a more exact calculation of their value for hemicellulose were estimated by chromatography.",

Dinitrogen (N2) fixation by the clover and translocation of fixed N to the grass were determined using 15N natural abundance. The wood ash produced the highest accumulated clover biomass over two cuts, followed by the crushed rock. Chemical analyses suggested that the increase was due to K supply by the amendments. The wood ash also led to larger amounts of fixed N compared with the control. However, N2 fixation was not increased as much as biomass amount, leading to dilution of plant N. There were minor or no treatment effects on mineralisation from soil N pools. This indicates that good-quality wood ash can be successfully used as a multi-element soil amendment to enhance clover growth on low-fertility soils.",

The amount of phosphorus applied to the rye crop in these two fertilizers was 66 kg/ha, the earlier applications amounted to 100 kg/ha. The superiority of superphosphate as a source of phosphorus to winter rye was in the both trials more or less distinct throughout the growing period, as could be shown by the dry matter weight and phosphorus uptake of rye plants from May to the middle of July, and by the actual yield results. It is assumed that an important cause for the superiority of superphosphate may be found in the fact that plants feeding on it are able to grow sprouts vigorous enough to endure the hard conditions of overwintering in our country. Particularly, the devastation caused by the low temperature parasitic fungi was in these two trials distincly decreased by the treatment with superphosphate. The positive effect of hyperphosphate was markedly lower. The soil analyses indicated that the hyperphosphate phosphorus occurred both in the more acid fine sand soil and, especially, in the less acid organic soil mostly in the calcium bound form, whereas the effect of superphosphate could be detected in the somewhat higher test values for aluminum and iron bound phosphorus.",

    "abstract": "Calcium nitrate and ammonium nitrate limestone (»Oulunsalpietari») were compared as the nitrogen fertilizer for oats in 15 field trials and for barley in one trial. The trials were carried out in summers 1959 and 1960 in various places in Finland. The split plot technique was employed in order to reduce the variation as much as possible. In 1959 the amounts of nitrogen applied as these two fertilizers to the corresponding halves of the plots were 25 and 50 kg/ha. In 1960 also higher applications were used: 75 and 100 kg/ha of N. In three trials these fertilizers were compared both as a surface dressing and worked in. Visual observations suggested about 5—6 weeks after sowing a darker green colour in the stands treated with calcium nitrate as compared with the other half treated with ammonium nitrate limestone. These differences later disappeared. In some trials a higher nitrogen content of the plants from the calcium nitrate stands could be demonstrated during this period. The uptake of nitrogen by plants was regularly followed throughout the growing period. Owing to the large variation, usually, no statistically significant difference between the effect of the fertilizers could be detected. In a few cases the superiority of calcium nitrate could be demonstrated. No differences in the ripening could be found. In most trials there was a fairly regular tendency to higher yields and higher nitrogen content in the grain and straw produced by calcium nitrate. Yet, only in a few cases were the differences statistically significant at the five per cent level. Thus, it was concluded that on the basis of the results of these trials ammonium nitrate limestone and calcium nitrate may be considered practically equal as nitrogen fertilizers for oats. There was no difference in the yields of barley produced by these two fertilizers, but the nitrogen content of grains was significantly lower with ammonium nitrate limestone than with calcium nitrate. This may be worth further study in connection with the production of malting barley.",

The type of the virus disease did not change from one vegetative generation of the potato to another. In the potato varieties Aquila and King George V, only the severe type of the disease was observed. The severe type of the virus disease reduced the tuber yield of all the potato varieties investigated to a level of 5 to 6 %, and the slight type occurring in the variety Harbinger to an average of 27 % of the normal. The virus infection appeared more frequently in Harbinger than in the variety Aquila. In the summer, when the infection of the potato plant took place, the virus disease reduced its productivity only relatively little. In the following vegetative generation of the diseased potato plants, the degree of their degeneration conclusively displayed itself. Following this, the wakening of the virus diseased plants did not progress further from one vegetative generation to the next.",

Additional N can be applied at particular stages of the plant’s development (phenology) to produce the best result from its use. The applicability of plant tissue N concentration as a diagnostic tool for measuring the N status of a wheat stand to guide economical use of additional N application was reviewed here. On the basis of grain protein concentration data, growers producing spring wheat with consistently low protein concentration are advised to pursue a more vigorous and better planned N fertilization programme in their crops. Plant tissue N testing provides a useful method for the producer to annually optimize wheat grain yield and grain protein concentration.

Field experiments were performed to evaluate the amount of activity of fallout nuclides transferred from soil to spring wheat and barley grown in fields supplemented by contaminated sewage sludge and further to calculate the soil-grain transfer factors. The experiments were conducted in southern Finland on clay, clay loam and sandy loam soil. The digested sludge was spread on fields, at a ratio of 22 tons of dry matter per hectare. The sludge formed in 1986 was spread in spring 1987 on ploughed fields before the preparation of the seedbed, or in autumn 1987 prior to ploughing.

The experiment was designed in two balanced 5x5 Latin squares. The experimental periods lasted for 4 weeks and the cows were fed with a fixed amount of 8 kg (air dry basis) concentrate in two equal portions. Timothy dominant unwilted grass silage was provided ad libitum. The nutrient digestibility, blood metabolites, milk yield and composition were studied. Grass silage intake decreased by replacing barley with RSO and increased with W 1 and W2. Oat feeding also increased silage intake compared to barley feeding. Oat feeding decreased the digestibility ofthe organic matter (OM) compared to barley. No significant difference was observed between diets in plasma concentrations of insulin, free fatty acids, acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate and glucose. Replacing part of the barley with RSO increased milk yield by 1.3 kg and 0.87 kg compared to oats and barley feeding, respectively. Replacement of barley by low energy birch wood decreased milk yield. Both RSO and oat feeding decreased milk protein content. Milk urea concentration was elevated by oats and depressed by RSO and birch wood. RSO and oat feeding decreased the short chain fatty acid content of milk, with a concomitant increase in stearic and oleic acids.",

The enzymes employed in the study were chymosin, plasmin and trypsin, as well as a cell-free extract from three Lactobacillus helveticus and nine Lactobacillus casei strains. The findings showed that the bond most sensitive to the proteolytic activity of chymosin was the Phe 105-Met 106. After 24 hours of hydrolysis a few other bonds in the casein macropeptide were also cleaved. Plasmin was found to have weak proteolytic activity under the conditions of this study. When the enzyme-substrate ratio was raised from 1:200 to 1:50, a few peptides were released from the N-terminal region. Trypsin was found to hydrolyze several κ-casein bonds, and peptides were released from almost all regions of the protein. The proteases of Lactobacillus had less effect than chymosin, plasmin or trypsin. The strains could be divided into three categories. L. helveticus strains had activity on bonds in the mid-section and C-terminal region, L. casei strains EB, P3, P8 and A 1 had activity on bonds in the N- and C-terminal regions, while L. casei A5 and M9 had activity only on bonds in the C-terminal region.",

In the traditional system the breeding females are kept all the time in cages well separated from each other. In the Nordic system, on the other hand, the breeding females are transferred prior to mating time into a separate shed where they are placed close to each other and sometimes males are put among them. After artificial insemination (AI) or natural matings, the females are transferred in the mating order to new cages. The condensed premating grouping is assumed to enhance the effect of air-borne male and female pheromones leading to a more intense and synchronised heat development. In this study these two systems were compared for timing and synchrony of parturitions. In contrast to the working hypothesis, date of whelpings were positively skewed with a great kurtosis in the traditional system, an indication that the majority of deliveries occurred during a short period and at the beginning of the season. On the other hand, in the Nordic system the whelpings were more uniformly distributed over the whole season and the peak was later. The results show that the most recent system, although widely used, is not necessarily the only possible alternative but other alternatives should also be considered. ;",

    "abstract": "More magnesium, on average, is removed annually from agricultural soils in Finland in yields (10 kg/ha) and through leaching (20kg/ha) than is replaced as fertilizers (4 kg/ha), manure (7 kg/ha) and as wet or dry depositions from the atmosphere (1 kg/ha). The amount of magnesium which is applied in assosiation with liming agents (at the most 25 kg/ha) has a decisie effect on the magnesium balance of the soils, although liming itself reduces those magnesium reserves of the soil which are extractable in neutral ammonium acetate(1 M) or in calcium chloride (0,01 M). The effect of two amounts of nitrogen and potassium fertilizers on the spring cereal and cultivated ley yields, on the magnesium uptake and nutrient contents of the yields, and the effect of liming on the magnesium status of the soil was studied using field, pot and incubation experiments in order to gain an estimate of requirement for magnesium fertilization. The results obtained with magnesium sulphate fertilizer in the same experiments were also used as an indicator of requirement for magnesium fertilization. The ammonium acetate (1 M, pH 7) extractable magnesium in the soil appeared to be the most important source of magnesium for the plants and the best indicator of requirement for magnesium fertilization. For the intensive cultivation of grassland crops, the soil should contain about 15 mg/100g of this type of magnesium. In pot experiments, the plants took up only small amounts of not extractable magnesium. Increasing the nitrogen fertilizer dosage (pot experiments, 4,5 l soil: N1=1500 mg, N2=3000mg N per year, field experiments: N1=50 kg/ha, N2=100 kg/ha N per year) generally brought about an increase in the magnesium uptake and in the magnesium content of the grasses. When the experiments were carried out using coarse mineral soils, the magnesium uptake and magnesium content of the plants decreased during the second and third year as the amount of nitrogen fertilizer increased. This was caused by the low magnesium content of the soil (pot experiments: below 12 mg/100 g soil in neutral ammonium acetate extractable magnesium, field experiments: below 100 mg/l soil in acid ammonium acetate extractable magnesium). In these soils, magnesium fertilization (200 mg Mg for 4,5 l soil per year or 57 kg/ha per year) appeared to have a positive effect on the supply of magnesium to the plants. The heavy clay and sandy clays used in the pot experiment did not require magnesium fertilization. The magnesium in silty clays, which contain a high proportion of the silt fraction (0,02—0,2 mm), may be liberated too slowly for intensively cultivated grasses and it may be necessary to give additional magnesium as fertilizer. Increasing the potassium fertilizer level from 60 kg/ha to 240 kg/ha K per year significantly decreased the magnesium content of the plants. Judging by the quality of the crops, a high potassium fertilizer level appeared to increase the requirement for magnesium fertilization. In the case of muddy very finesand the yield and magnesium uptake of timothy decreased with an increase in the amount of potassium applied. Liming (90, 180 or 360 mg/100g soil Ca as CaCO3) decreased the amount of neutral ammonium acetate extractable magnesium, in seven mineral soils out of nine, by 2—24 % in comparison to the magnesium content of unlimed soils. Part of the fertilizer magnesium became not extractable, too.",

The Na2-EDTA treatment seemed not to affect the quantity of the dry matter yields, but it affected markedly their chemical composition. Increased contents of P, Al and Fe were found in all the harvests. In two soil samples the P supply was improved by 35—45 %. The accumulation of Al, Fe and Mn induced by Na2-EDTA tended to be the more effective the greater the stability constant for the corresponding metal-EDTA chelate was. Thus, the iron uptake increased most intensively, i.e. by 217—458 %, and that of aluminium by 33—120 %. On the basis of the first two harvests the manganese absorption by the rye grass seemed to decrease probably due to the enormous accumulation of iron. The results also suggested that the addition of Na2-EDTA to the soil was not able essentially to affect the magnesium and calcium supply to the plants.",

The pH(CaCl2) of the very fine sand used as growth base was raised from its initial value of 4.9 to either 5.7 or 6.5 by the addition of calcitic limestone (12 g or 24 g limestone/3.9 kg of soil, respectively).

At pH(CaCl2) 6.5 about 20 % of the magnesium applied as magnesium sulphate was converted into a form not extractable in 1 M neutral ammonium acetate. This not extractable magnesium appeared to be utilized slowly by ryegrass, which may indicate that magnesium bound in various Al-Mg compounds in limed soil is to some extent available to plants. At pH (CaCl2) 5.7 and 6.5 around 70 % and 85 %, respectively, of the magnesium derived from dolomitic limestones was not extractable in neutral ammonium acetate. The ryegrass was unable to utilize this not extractable magnesium during the two-year experimental period.

The peak of pycnospore release on raspberry canes was in July 1981. Other weak wound pathogens were isolated: Fusarium avenaceum (Cda. ex Fr.) Sacc., which occurred in 22 % of the transfers, F. culmorum (W. G. Sm.) Sacc., Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr. and the secondly most common Phoma species, P. exigua Desm. v. exigua Maas. The fungi mentioned above were mainly obtained from different depths of the raspberry stem tissues, the least on an average from the pith. Alternaria alternate (Fr.) Keissl. was the most common ’surface fungus’, Phialophora spp., wood rotting saprophytes, common also in the pith. Leptosphaeria coniothyrium (Fckl.) Sacc., the most strong of the pathogens, was rare in the samples. The occurrence of Cylindrocarpon destructans (Zinssm.) Scholten in root samples changed 8-70 %. The cv. Muskoka is more susceptible to spur blight than cv. Ottawa. On the other hand, the larvae of raspberry cane midge (Resseliella theobaldi (Barnes)) produced plenty of injuries in Ottawa-samples originating from Mikkeli in 1980 and thus increased also the fungal damage.",

The effect of five liming (10% Mg and 19% Ca) levels, 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 tons ha -1 , on the herb and essential oil yield and menthol and menthone content of two mint species (peppermint, Mentha x piperita, a variety of Black Mitcham and Sachalin mint, Mentha arvensis var. sacchalinensis) cultivated in fine sand soil in Northern Finland (6440N and 2505E) was studied during 1998-2000. Liming clearly increased the pH levels and the Ca and Mg content of the soil. The dry matter content, essential oil quantity, and the menthol or menthone content in mints were not affected by liming. In comparison with no liming however, liming at a rate of 4 t ha -1 doubled the herb yield. The highest yield was achieved in Sachalin mint by liming at 4 or 8 t ha -1 in the second and third year (soil pH 6-6.5) (Ca 725-871 mg l -1 and Mg 122- 219 mg l -1 ), and in peppermint by liming at 4, 8 or 16 t ha -1 (soil pH 6-6.6) (Ca 725-1272 mg l -1 and Mg 122-245 mg l -1 ). Therefore, we conclude that a higher peppermint and Sachalin mint yield is achieved by increasing soil pH to values above 6.0 in the fine sand soil of Northern Finland.;",

In both weight classes the thickness of the fat was measured with an ultrasonic instrument on the back, hams and shoulders, as well as the depth of the m. long, dorsi. Exterior measurements and points evalutations were also made. The pigs were slaughtered at a weight of 90 kg, after which a conventional carcass evaluation was made. The least squares method (HARVEY 1966) was used to analyse the results in order to establish the effect of the live weight, the group, breed and sex. After calculating an initial correlation matric (179 x 179), 20 characteristics obtained from the carcass evaluation were taken as functions, and 30 characteristics of both the live weights taken as optional explanatory variables, for further processing by stepwise multiple regression analysis. The back fat can be estimated from measurements at live weights of 60 kg (R2 = 0.53) and 90 kg (R2 = 0.75). The fat estimations obtained from the two weight classes showed similarities. The average back fat measured at a live weight of 90 kg correlated significantly with the average back fat measured from the carcass (r = 0.82***, r2 = 0.67), and the side fat at a live weight of 90 kg with the s.o.l. from the carcass (r = 0.79***, r2 = 0.62). Prediction of the area of the m. long. dorsi was poor in both the weights (R2 = 0.27—0.29).",

The amino acid composition, however, was improved, because the proportion of lysine was increased by 6 ± 4 %. Accordingly, the content of lysine in flour was decreased by irrigation only by 10 ± 5 %. An increase of fertilizer nitrogen from 68 to 144 kg/ha increased the protein content of wheat flour by 19 ± 5 %, but the proportion of lysine in the amino acid composition decreased by 9 ± 4 %. Therefore, the lysine content in flour was increased by nitrogen fertilization only by 8 ± 5 %. It seemed as if urea and ammonium nitrate limestone would have had about the same effect on the quantity and quality of wheat protein. As a consequence of the reversed influences of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on the wheat protein it was possible, by means of irrigation and an additional nitrogen fertilization, to produce 65 per cent higher grain yields without any noteworthy changes in the contents of protein or amino acids.",

The examined harvesting methods were tractor-powered forage harvester (TPFH), self-propelled forage harvester (SPFH), self-loading forage wagon (SLFW), and combined baling and wrapping (CBW). The results from the field measurements indicated that the model was working either well or satisfactorily with the examined methods, apart from the CBW method, which would require redefining the model coefficients. Model sensitivity analysis indicated that variables such as yield level, working width, and transportation distance have a significant effect on fuel consumption. When the working width was increased from 3 m to 9 m, the fuel consumption of the examined methods decreased ca. 54–61%. Increasing the working width by windrowing was found recommended for all examined methods. In all, the most energy-efficient method was SLFW, but it was also most sensitive to transportation distance. With a transportation distance of 10 km, the fuel consumption of the SLFW method was already 9–11 % higher compared to that of TPFH and SPFH methods. The strong effect of these variables may cause a wide variation in the fuel consumption of the examined methods, but the model can be used to standardize this effect. The results from this study can thus be used for approximate estimations of average fuel consumption of the examined forage harvesting methods.",

Root numbers of turfgrasses were measured from soil depths of 040 cm by minirhizotrons. The minirhizotrons tubes were installed in the most compressed (center) and less walked (edge) parts of putting greens with good or weak winter survival. The highest root numbers were recorded under less walked green edge areas with good winter survival. The lowest root numbers were measured from center areas of greens, especially from areas suffering winter damage in previous years. Morphological parameters of roots were studied by a destructive soil sampling method in midseason 1998. Based on image analysis of washed roots, root length density at soil depths of 02.5 cm was 400 cm cm3 in greens of weak winter survival and up to 900 cm cm3 in greens of good winter survival. Our findings emphasize that root growth of turfgrasses is highly dynamic and sensitive to compression despite of non significant effects on soil porosity. Reduced root growth of greens with weak winter survival continued despite of recovery of shoot growth.;",

This was defined as empirical bias. The pedigree indices were computed from reduced data sets where four years of the most recent data were excluded. Results showed an upward bias in the protein yield pedigree indices for Ayrshire young sires of 2.2 kg, 2.5 kg and 1.8 kg from the repeatability animal model, random regression test-day model and random regression test-day model with heterogeneous variance adjustment, respectively. Pedigree indices for daughters of young sires were upward biased, whereas pedigree indices for daughters of proven sires were slightly underestimated when heterogeneous variance was not accounted. Inclusion of test-day yields from the fourth lactation onwards increased the bias. Moving from repeatability animal model to random regression test-day model did not reduce the bias, whereas adjustment of heterogeneous variance reduced bias.;",

An empirical illustration is presented for Swedish pig producers considering the impact of growth rates, feed conversion efficiency and mortality rates. Moreover, the variation in pig prices and the biological variation in the growth rates of pigs are considered. Producers are assumed to be risk averse and the risk aversion concept is elaborated by obtaining the producers desired confidence level that corresponds to a given risk aversion coefficient. The results suggest that there exists a range of Pareto efficient share allocations.

    "abstract": "The present investigation deals with the occurrence of parturient disturbances and certain metabolic diseases in Ayrshire cows at the Viik Farm and the effect of these disorders on milk production, especially during the ascending phase of lactation. The experimental material consists of the daily milk weighings and the health data on lactating cows which have been kept on record since the year 1947. The number of cows in the herd has been about 70, and approximately 900 calvings have occurred between 1947 and the end of the control year 1961—62. In evaluating the influence of parturient and metabolic disturbances on milk production, endeavours were made to estimate how much the disturbance changed the shape of the lactation curve at the ascending phase and decreased the peak production. In connection with some of the disturbances, the effect on the total milk production during the 12-month lactation period was also estimated. The metabolic disorders (parturient paresis, grass tetany and ketosis) were generally treated by a veterinarian. In cases of afterbirth retention and difficult calving, the herd foreman performed the necessary measures. The results found in this investigation were as follows: Retention of afterbirth occurred in 10.8 % of the calvings. It was relatively more frequent in older cows than in heifer cows. In general this disorder did not affect lactation or caused only a slight decline in milk yield at the beginning of lactation. Difficult calving occurred in 3.1 % of the calvings. It was relatively much more frequent in heifer cows than in older animals. There was generally no influence on lactation as a result of difficult calving or only a slight decline in milk production at the beginning of lactation. Twinning occurred in 1.6 % of the calvings with a normal gestation period. When the calves were alive at birth, there was no adverse effect on milk production. The birth of a dead calf occurred in 2.0 % of the calvings with a normal gestation period. Its effect on milk production varied in the individual cases. Sometimes there was no effect at all on milk yield, whereas other times there was a decrease in milk production at the beginning of lactation or a reduction in the production peak. In some cases a loss of as much as 500—600 kg (10—16 %) during the 12- month lactation period was observed. Abortion occurred in 1.5 % of the calvings when the duration of gestation was from 178 to 267 days. The effect of abortion on lactation depended essentially on the number of times the cow had calved and on the length of gestation. When the cow calved for at least the fourth time and the gestation period was 234—265 days, abortion had only a mild influence on milk production. When the cow aborted at its second calving and the gestation period was 184—246 days, its 12-month production was 1000—3000 kg less than expected. In those cases when the cow aborted at its first calving and the gestation period was 178—236 days, its udder was generally so undeveloped that it produced no milk. Parturient paresis occurred in 5.3 % of the calvings. It occurred commonly in high-producing animals and was more frequent in older cows than in younger ones; in addition, it was relatively more frequent during the winter than the pasture feeding period. The disease began most usually on the day of calving or on the following day. Subcutaneous injection of vitamin D proved to be an effective prophylactic measure against this disturbance. When parturient paresis occurred on the day of calving or the following day, it generally had a severe effect on milk production at the very beginning of the ascending phase of lactation (Fig. 1). Its effect on the peak, however, was slight or nonexistent. The reduction in the 12- month milk production caused by this disease was most often 50—100 kg. When the disease occurred at a later stage of lactation, its influence lasted only about 3—5 days and reduced the milk production by 10—40 kg. Grass tetany occurred in 4.3 % of the calvings. It occurred generally in high-producing animals and was more frequent in older cows than in younger ones; furthermore it usually occurred at the beginning of the pasture period, most often in cows which had recently calved. Effective preventative measures against grass tetany proved to be a long transitional period between winter feeding and pasturing as well as the use of magnesium-containing mineral salts on the pasture. In about 1/5 of the cases of this disease, the animal died or had to be slaughtered. Even in those cases when the cow recovered, the disease grealty reduced the daily milk yield and its adverse effect lasted for a long time (Figs. 2 and 3). When grass tetany occured during the first month after calving, the 12-month milk production was decreased by several hundred kilograms, even as much as over 1000 kg. On the other hand, when the disease occurred 2—8 months after calving, the loss in milk production was generally only a hundred kilograms or somewhat more. Ketosis occurred in 3.4 % of the calvings, being prevalent generally in high-producing cows. It did not occur in heifer cows, but among the other cows it was equally frequent in the younger animals as in the older ones. The disease usually began during the first month after calving. It greatly reduced the daily milk yield and at the same time its effect lasted for a long time (Figs. 4 and 5). The average decrease in production for the 12-month lactation period was estimated at 300 kg (6 %), ranging from 0 to 600 kg (0—12 %). The frequent occurrence of parturient paresis and grass tetany in certain families and generally several times in the same cow indicates that hereditary factors have a significance on the occurrence of these diseases. In the case of ketosis, however, no such hereditary influence was observed. Since both of the former diseases often occurred in the same cow, they were considered as a single disorder in examining their repeatability in the cows. Statistical examination showed that the repeatability of parturient paresis and grass tetany among the cows in the present investigation was rather significant.",

Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse: Der innerhalb der Geschlechter bestehende Unterschied in der Dicke des Rückenspeckes betrug bei der Yorkshirerasse 3.12 ± 0.025 und bei den Landschweinen 2.15 ± 0.058 mm. Der Anteil der zwischen den Geschlechtern bestehenden Unterschiede an der Gesamtvariation der Rückenspeckdicke belief sich auf annähernd 21 %. Die Heritabilität der Rückenspeckdicke betrug, aus der zwischen Halbgeschwischtern bestehende Korrelation berechnet, 52 %; wenn aber die zwischen den Geschlechtern erscheinenden Differenzen eliminiert wurden, stieg die Heritabilität auf 67 %. Die Variation im Gewicht des kalten Körpers war verhältnismässig weit; die Gesamtstreuung machte 2.463 kg aus, wobei sich der Unterschied zwischen den äussersten Schwankungsgrenzen auf 15 kg belief. Nur kaum 1/3 dieser Werte liess sich auf die Lebendgewichtsunterschiede im Augenblick des Schlachtens zurückführen, während der hauptsächliche Teil auf den Schwankungen des Schlachtverlustes beruhte.

Die Regression der Rückenspeckdicke vom Schlachtgewicht belief sich bei den ♀-Ferkeln auf 0.506 mm/kg, aber bei den ♂-Ferkeln auf 0.288 mm/kg, wobei die innerhalb des Geschlechtes bestehende Regression 0.390 mm/kg ausmachte. Innerhalb der Rassen berechnet, waren die entsprechenden Werte 0.527, 0.294 und 0.403 mm/kg. Die Korrelation zwischen der Rückenspeckdicke und dem Schlachtgewicht beruhte teilweise auf erblichen Faktoren, während sich die genetische Korrelation auf belief. Auch diese genetische Korrelation war bei den ♀-Ferkeln enger als bei den ♂-Ferkeln, wobei die Korrelationen entsprechend 0.237 ± 0.105 und 0.069 ± 0.106 waren. Rasse und Geburtsstall der Ferkel waren nicht nennenswert an der Variation von Rückenspeckdicke und Schlachtgewicht beteiligt, wohl aber in gewissen Masse an der zwischen ihnen bestehenden Kovarianz.",

All birds were processed in a European commercial processing plant using a high current, constant voltage stunning system and air chilling. According to a modified Mitscherlich response equation, pH values reached their ultimate value by 5.77 h post-mortem, with an asymptotic 95 % confidence interval of 5.72 h-5.81 h post-mortem. The shear force data, which were analyzed using a logistic model, suggested that broiler breast fillets should be aged intact on the carcass for 10.58 h, 5.94 h or 2.28 h to guarantee that over 95 % of the fillets reach Allo-Kramer shear forces of 8.0, 9.0 or 11.0 kg/g, respectively. Since acceptable meat tenderness values vary with country, geographical area, or consumer groups, acceptable ranges should be determined according to potential market demands. No relationships between deboning time and fresh meat color or cooking loss was found.",

The degree of the view and the free floor area of the cage varied between the five types of cage used. Each animal spent 2 weeks in each type of cage and their behaviour was videorecorded for a 24-h period in each 2-week period. The foxes spent 59 ± 13% of their daily time on the platforms. Use declined from 72 ± 13% in September to 35 ± 21% in November. Males used the platforms more than did females. In late October and early November, the foxes in cages with an obstructed view from the floor made more use of the platforms for both active behaviour and resting than did those in cages with an unobstructed view from the floor. The larger the free floor area of the cage, the less the silver foxes used the platforms during activity in mid-August and mid-September. One probable function of the platform is to offer the foxes an observation and resting place with an open view in all directions.",

Depending on the year, plants covered in spring alone gave a significantly earlier (4 to 9 days) marketable yield than did uncovered plants. The non-woven cover had no effect on marketable yield at Sotkamo but at Rovaniemi it increased the yield, especially in cold years. The use of cover decreased the amount of mouldy berries. At both experimental sites, a significantly higher yield was obtained from beds covered with soil mulches than from uncovered beds.

Results expressed as population frequencies and densities indicated that S. griseoviridis effectively colonizes the rhizosphere when the microbe is applied immediately after sowing but less effectively when it is applied 7 days later. Detection values of S. griseoviridis were higher for turnip rape than for carrot. In sterile sand, S. griseoviridis invaribly colonized the rhizosphere of turnip rape after each of the two applications. These findings indicate that S. griseoviridis can compete with indigenous soil microbes in the rhizosphere if it is sufficiently abundant in the soil before the seed emerges. If applied later, however, it competes rather poorly. In root-free nonsterile sand, S. griseoviridis dispersed and survived well.",

The digestibility and nitrogen balance study was conducted with nine finishing barrows (live weight of 75-93 kg) using a two-period reversal design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Wheat bran, untreated or expanded with a Kahl expander at a temperature of 105- 110°C, was included at two levels of 150 or 300 g kg-1 in barley-based diet supplemented with minerals and vitamins and fortified with lysine. The level of wheat bran in the diet had a diminishing effect on organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), and hemicellulose (HC) digestibilities of the diet and tended to decrease those of crude protein (CP) and ash. Expanding of the wheat bran affected a non-significant improvement on ether extract (EE), NDF, acid detergent fibre (ADF) and HC digestibilities of the diet. Nutrient digestibilities of wheat bran and expanded wheat bran computed by regression were 0.64, 0.67 for OM; 0.70, 0,70 for CP; 0.47, 0.63 for EE; 0.35, 0.40 for NDF and 0.01, 0,16 for ADF, respectively.

Metabolic activity of four common agricultural fungi incubated in peat and wood shavings at 25°C and 4°C was characterized in this study using previously specified volatile metabolites of micro-organisms and CO2 production as indicators. The volatile organic compounds were collected into Tenax resin and analysed by gas chromatography. Several microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs), e.g. 1-butanol, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol and 1-octanol were detected in laboratory experiments; however, these accounted for only 0.08-1.5% of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs). Emission rates of MVOCs were 0,001-0.176 μg/kg of bedding materials per hour. Despite some limitations of the analytical method, certain individual MVOCs, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone and 3-octanone, were also detected in concentrations of less than 4.6 μg/m3 (0.07-0.31% of TVOC) in a horse stable where peat and shavings were used as bedding materials. MVOC emission rate was estimated to be 0.2-2.0 μg/kg x h-1 from bedding materials in the stable, being about ten times higher than the rates found in the laboratory experiments. Some compounds, e.g. 3-octanone and 1-octen-3-ol, can be assumed to originate mainly from microbial metabolisms.",

    "abstract": "In the assessment of the economic effects of climate change, changes in returns and costs have to be taken into consideration. Changes in returns are mainly caused by changes in the yield level. Costs are determined by various factors. Harvesting conditions may improve as the temperatures are higher. However, an increasing need for disease and pest control results in higher costs. Various extensive studies have indicated that rising temperatures with the CO2 fertilizing effect increase the crop potential in Finland. From the economic point of view an increase in yield level is highly significant, because the increase in costs remains quite small, A 10% increase in the yield level raises the farm income by about 6%. Because agriculture is supported in many ways either directly or indirectly, the rise in income level may be offset by lowering the support. Consequently, farmers may not benefit from an increase in the yield level, but the benefit will go to the state economy. However, an increase in the yield level resulting from rising temperatures is advantageous to the national economy, regardless of whether the benefit goes to the farmers or to the state.",

There were 100 individual boxes available, of which ca. 90 were annually used for Finnsheep (F). The rams were fed on concentrate diet (13.5 % DCP) ad lib. + hay. The test period was from 60 to 150 days of age. Feed intake (FI) was recorded daily, live weights (LW) fortnightly. At the end, MLD-areas were ultrasonically scanned, fleeces weighed, some linear body measurements taken, and fleshiness and wool quality scored. A total of 276 F rams were tested. They were progeny of 85 sires (2—4 half-brothers/sire). The means for all rams (30 selected rams) were: birth type 3.19 (3.18), rearing type 2.93 (3.01), age at start 64.3 (63.7) days, 60-day LW 19.5 (19.5) kg, 150-day LW 45.1 (47.6) kg, ADG 284 (312) g/d, FI 1.28 (1.34) kg/d, FE 4.49 (4.29) kg/kg gain, MLD-area 8.83 (9.63) cm2. There was considerable variation in the important traits (ADG, FI, FE, MLD-area), in spite of preselection. The phenotypic correlations of ADG with 150-d. LW, FI, Fl/kg gain and MLD-area were .61, .57, —.63 and .37, resp. (PC.001). Those of 150-d.LW with the last three traits were .59, —.15 NS and 0.44, resp.(P&lt; .001). Selection for ADG, 150-d. LW, Fl/kg gain and MLD area in the performance test appeared to improve the value of offspring for meat production in F.",

The samples were determinated for particle size distribution, pH(CaCl2), organic C %, at pH 7 exchangeable Ca, Mg and K, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), exchange acidity (AI + H) and plant available (Bray 1) P. The differences between topsoil and subsoil were studied taking into consideration the fertilization and liming during the past ten years before sampling. The correlations between soil characteristics were also studied. The clay (&lt; 2 µm) and silt (2—20 µm) contents, exchangeable Mg and exchange acidity were lower in the topsoil than in the subsoil; as for the remaining characteristics, the values for topsoil were higher than those for subsoil. The subsoil seemed to be more heterogenic than the topsoil. There was a closer correlation between exchangeable Ca, Mg and K and the clay content in the subsoil than in the topsoil. In Litorina soils, there was a weak correlation between exchangeable cations and clay. It is more difficult to predict the cation contents on the basis of soil particle size distribution in soils cropped intensively, since fertilization and liming have changed the original contents. Vertical movement of applied Ca occurred slightly, possibly because the topsoils were rich in organic C. There was some correlation between organic C and exchangeable Mg or K, indicating a minor effect of organic matter on the leaching of these cations. The plant available P content of the subsoil was about 10 % of that of the topsoil irrespective of the amount of P applied. Clay and organic C contents were the main constituents of effective cation exchange capacity in the topsoil; in the subsoil the significance of clay was greatest.",

Forty-one lambs (25 L and 16 F x L) of both sexes were weaned at 8 weeks of age and fattened for 14 weeks. The diet (11,6 MJ/kg d.m.M.E.) consisted of maize silage ad lib., 200 g/d of dried sugar beet pulp, 150 g/d of soybean meal and 30 g/d supplement. F x L lambs grew slightly more than L lambs (197 vs 176 g/d; P &lt; .1) during the suckling period but not during the fattening period (207 vs 203 g/d; n.s.), reaching a slightly higher slaughter weight (36.9 vs 35.5 kg; n.s.). Crossbred lambs consumed, during fattening, slightly more d.m. (75.9 vs 73.1 g • d-1 • kg-1 • L.W.-75) and M.E. ( .88 vs .85 MJ • d-1 • kg-1• L.W.-75). D.M. conversion was not different (4.24 vs 4.16; P &gt; .1) while M.E. requirements for growth, estimated assuming a maintenance requirement of.44 MJ • d-1 • kg-1 • L.W.-75, resulted higher (+7 %) for F x L than for L lambs (2.18 vs 2.04 MJ • kgDG • kg-1 • L.W.-75; P &lt; .1). The ram-lambs showed superior growth potential and feed efficiency in respect to the ewe-lambs. In conclusion it appears that crossbreeding with Finnsheep is not detrimental to the in vivo performance of fattening Lamon lambs except for a slight increase of the energy requirements for growth.",

    "abstract": "Population phenomena in higher plants are reviewed critically, particularly in relation to clonality. An array of concepts used in the field are discussed. In contrast to animals, higher plants are modular in structure. Plant populations show hierarchy at two levels: ramets and genets. In addition, their demography is far more complicated, since even the direction of development of a ramet may change by rejuvenation. Therefore, formulae concerning animal populations often require modification for plants. Furthermore, at the zygotic stage, higher plants are generally less mobile than animals. Accordingly, their population processes tend to be more local. Most populations of plants have a genetic structure: alleles and genotypes are spatially aggregated. Due to the short-ranged foraging behaviour of pollinators, genetically non-random pollination prevails. A generalized formula for parent-offspring dispersal variance is derived. It is used to analyze the effect of clonality on genetic patchiness in populations. In self-compatible species, an increase in clonality will tend to increase the degree of patchiness, while in self-incompatible species a decrease may result. Examples of population structure studies in different species are presented. A considerable degree of genetic variation appears to be found also in the populations of species with a strong allocation of resources to clonal growth or apomictic seed production. Some consequences of clonality are considered from the point of view of genetic conservation and plant breeding.",

The chemical composition of barley was analysed before treatment and after 12 months of storage. Fungal contamination of grain samples was analysed. Application of 1.5 % or more urea effectively preserved the grain for 12 months. At the highest moisture content, 1.0 % of urea did not prevent deterioration during storage. The average recovery of dry matter was 97.1 %, of nitrogen 93.9 %. Ammonia was released from hydrolysis of urea. The degree of hydrolysis increased with increasing moisture content of barley. Raising the levels of urea from 1.0 to 2.5 % significantly increased the quantity but tended to decrease the proportion of urea hydrolysed. Representatives of 33 genera of fungi and unidentified actinomycetes were present in the grain lots examined. Most fungi were found only occasionally and their incidence declined towards the end of storage. The grain stored at the highest moisture level (32 %) contained more fungi and less actinomycetes than other seed lots. All urea treatments reduced the number of fungi on seeds. Urea concentration of 2 % or more eliminated Fusarium- and Aspergillus species on all moisture levels. Scopulariopsis brevicaulis (Sacc.) Bain, and other species of Scopulariopsis were the most commonly encountered fungi after urea treatment. The total number of Scopulariopsis ssp. exceeded 100 % and the amount remained high for 40 weeks of storage until a rapid decline towards the end of storage. Urea treatment also favoured the occurrence of actinomycetes.",

In all soil samples, the P test values correlated closely (r = 0.93***). However, they differed significantly in the clay soils where PAAc amounted to 59—96 % of Pw . In the coarser soils, the acetate solution extracted 70—365 % of the water-soluble P, but the difference between the methods remained insignificant. In both soil groups, the molar ratio of NH4F-P to oxalate-soluble Al explained 90 % or more of the variation in the P test values. The soil samples were divided into different P content classes according to the acetate test calibration scheme. In various P classes the test values tended to differ statistically significantly: in the lower classes acetate extracted P more and in the higher classes less than water did. Only in soils ranked as satisfactory in P the test values were about equal. When the rating scale limits given for the advisory soil testing were applied to the water extraction, in most soils the difference between the P testing methods was of one P class.

Data presented show that a high litter size(LS) has been established (mean 2.8 in 3 year old ewes) by a policy of selection coupled with minimising generation interval. Observations on ovulation rate (OR)show a large range (1—13) and are consistent with an hypothesis that OR is influenced by a major gene effect superimposed on a basal level of about 2.5 ova. The gene appears to increase ovulation by about two ova per copy and to have a frequency approaching 0.3 in the Bangor University flock. Data on the relationship of LS at birth and of lambs weaned per ewe are presented which indicate that under ideal conditions the optima for OR and LS at birth cannot exceed 5 and 3.5 respectively for mature ewes. The practical utilisation of the breed as a dam-line sire of crossbred ewes show that the Cambridge crossbreds are more precocious, more prolific, have slower growing lambs with carcasses of similar quality to the corresponding Border Leicester crosses.

The gilts gave better carcase quality than the castrates and the lower-protein diet tended to give better carcase quality.

    "abstract": "Eight digestibility trials were performed with rams to evaluate the nutritive values of energy willow leaves (Salix Aqualica), whole short rotation trees (S. Aquatica, S. dasyclados), forest biomass, consisting of branches, foliage and browses, entire hardwood, hydrolysed birch tree pulp and dissolving pulp. The chemical composition of the materials varied according to the leaf-to-wood ratio and the degree of hydrolysis of the pulp. The leaves had high protein contents and low crude fibre contents but remarkably high contents of acid detergent fibre (ADF). The materials containing wood had a high crude fibre content, 41—54 %, as had also both pulps, 44—75 %, but the ADF content was on average 17.4 %-units higher than the content of crude fibre. The lignin content was high in the wood-containing materials (29—34 %) and also high in one of the leaf pulps. The digestibilities of the leaf pulps varied considerably, from 42 to 61 % for DM. The forest biomass had organic matter OM digestibility varying from 20 to 39 %. The digestibility was affected by the ratio of foliage to wood in the material. Hydrolysed wood pulp had poor digestibility, 38 % for OM, but the digestibility of dissolving pulp was comparable to that of good quality roughage, 75 %. The leaf pulps and dissolving pulp had FU values of 0.48—0.69/kg DM. Forest biomass and hydrolysed birch pulp had low values, 0.22—0.34 FU/kg DM. Various energy evaluation systems were compared in the feed value calculations. The fibre correction system gave very low values. Tree foliage and cellulosic wastes with a low lignin content can be utilized as ruminant feed but the possibilities of disposing in this way of cellulosic wastes with high lignocellulosic contents are very limited.",

    "abstract": "Finnsheep (F) was used in a crossbreeding project to improve overall productivity of the DLS breed. Productive and reproductive traits of seven crossbred combinations ranging from 1/8F to 7/8F breeding were compared to those of the two parental breeds. Suffolk rams were used to mate all ewes (361) for five parturitions (1312 records). Ovulation rate (OR) and litter size (LS) at birth for all the groups increased progressively as F breeding increased. The 4/8F ewes weaned the heaviest litters. Percentage of ova lost per ewe mated ranged from 18 % to 29 %. Preweaning mortality rate was highest in F ewes. Total kg of lambs weaned per ewe exposed was highest in 4/8F followed by F whereas that of DLS was lowest. The 4/8F exhibited 25 % heterosis (H) in kg of lambs weaned per ewe exposed. The linear regressions of OR (b = .24), of LS at birth (b = .14) and at weaning (b = .08) on proportion of F breeding in crosses were significant. The regressions were quadratic for percent ova lost and lamb mortality at weaning. The crosses showed positive H in grease fleece weight (GFW), the highest being expressed by the 4/8F and 5/8F crosses. Significant linear relationships were observed between F breeding and GFW (2nd shearing), fiber thickness and variability in both fiber length and fiber thickness, whereas the relationships of F breeding with GFW (3rd and later shearings), clean wool percentage and fiber length were quadratic. Most of the crosses exhibited positive H particularly in clean wool percentage and in staple and fiber length. H was often highest in the 4/8F cross. Genetic group of dam had a significant effect on age at slaughter, leg, loin and kidney fat as a percent of the carcass, lean, fat and bone percent of the 12th rib and fat thickness over loin-eye muscle. A significant linear relationship existed between most of these carcass measurements and the proportion of F breeding in the lambs’ dam.",

Their effect on soil pH was compared with a crystalline calcite. Besides establishing the slags' inherent liming ability, three methods were used in order to establish mathematical relationships for the conversion of data according to European standardisation. With the Soil Incubation method it was found that the converter slags and the amorphous blast furnace slags were slightly superior to the other slags in raising the soil pH of a silty loam, whereas in an acid peat the differences were quite small. Over a prolonged period the slags showed almost the same efficiency as the calcite. When comparing the same particle size fractions, in some cases the finer fraction of calcite gave a better result, whereas the slags were often superior in the coarse particle sizes. Using Sauerbeck/Rietz and the modified Finnish pH Stat methods the converter slags and the amorphous slags showed the highest neutralizing ability. The Finnish method performed a more gentle acid-lime reaction, and this time-consuming method correlated better with reaction in soil than the Sauerbeck/Rietz method. Conversion factors between data from the three methods were computed for all particle size fractions, and correlation equations for practical use established.",

The material consisted of 205 1-year old steers and bulls and 174 bull calves. Within experiment each trait of each animal was corrected for age, breed and feeding with a correction factor obtained with the least squares method. In the stepwise regression analysis the results for both age groups were analysed separately. From live measurements the best estimators in both age groups were width of chest, heart girth and natural length. The most reliable predictor of meat quantity was carcass weight. Revalue was 96 % for both age groups. In estimation of meat percentage the Revalue obtained for the olds with cutting results of fore shanks was 56 %, the respective value for the 1-year olds was considerably lower. With 1-yearolds the carcass weight and some byproducts gave the highest estimations for the quantity and percentage of fat, R2 were 62 % and 50 % respectively, and for the 14-yearolds the kidney fats and the cutting results of flanks gave the highest estimations, R2 were 70 % and 59 % respectively. For the quantity and percentage of bone the R2 for the 1-yearolds obtained with cutting results of shanks were 68 % and 55 % respectively, and for the 14-year olds 82 % and 70 % respectively. When the cutting results of the fore and hind quarters were used as estimators the R2 obtained for all the traits were higher in both age groups than with any other estimator, R2 obtained with carcass quality scores remained lower.",

    "abstract": "In the years 1967—70 twelve irrigation experiments of spring wheat were carried out in southern Finland (60-62° N, 22-26° E). Sprinkler irrigation (2 X 30 mm) increased the grain yields on an average by 1240±470kg/ha (from 2740 to 3980 kg) or 45±17 %. The increases in yield were significant on clay soils (9 trials) and loam (1 trial) but insignificant on fines and (1 trial) and mould (1 trial). Additional nitrogen fertilization (from 76 to 143kg/ha N) increased the grain yields on an average by 350± 200 kg/ha or 11±6 %. The ripening of wheat was significantly promoted by irrigation in one year but slightly retarded in three years. Nitrogen fertilization slightly retarded ripening every year The falling number of grains tended to be slightly improved by irrigation (from 285 to 321, on an average), but in most trials irrigation and nitrogen fertilization had no significant influence on the falling number. Irrigation decreased the crude protein content of grains in all trials, on an average by 2.2 ± 0.7 %-units (from 16.3 to 14.1%). This unfavourable effect was, however, avoided with additional nitrogen which increased the protein content by 1.9±0.4%-units (from 14,3 to 16.2 %). The effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on those characteristics of wheat that are correlated with protein, were similar to the effects on the protein content. Thus, irrigation decreased the zeleny value (from 64 to 53 ml), cold viscosity (from 214 to 114 seconds), water absorption (from 66.5 to 64.9 %) and the valorimeter value (from 68 to 60), while these characteristics were improved by nitrogen fertilization. Irrigation did not decrease the Pelshenke value but increased significantly the ratio of the Pelshenke value/protein content (from 5,1 to 6.1). This indicates that the quality of protein was improved by irrigation, while the effect of nitrogen fertilization was the reverse. In fact, irrigation and additional nitrogen fertilization affected the quantity and quality of protein and the baking quality characteristics of wheat in opposite directions but the quantity of grain yield in the same direction. With these two methods combined it was possible to produce 60 % higher grain yields without any noteworthy changes in the baking quality characteristics of spring wheat.",

According to test points, made up of a combination of these two traits, the 5 best boars, 5 average boars and the 5 poorest boars where selected for progeny evaluation. In all 26 boars and 441 progeny were tested. The progeny evaluation showed that ultrasonic measurement of the fat thickness of the boars gave a very reliable estimate of the meatiness of their progeny. Those boars, as a group, giving the poorest carcass quality could be distinguished with statistical reliability from the other groups. The correlations between sires and progeny were significant for both daily gain (period 20—88 kg) and feed efficiency. The importance of rate of growth and feed efficiency has been neglected in selection for breeding as the test points used for the selection of boars depended almost entirely on fat thickness. More than 30 % of both boars and progeny boars suffered from some form of difficulty in walking. 13 % of the boars were eliminated because of leg faults. Leg faults in progeny were mainly inherited or caused through injury. A phenotype evaluation of progeny boars accounts much more effectively for the variation in their carcass value than does a full barrow sib evaluation alone. For best results, a progeny boar phenotype evaluation should be combined with a full barrow sib evaluation.",

Vegetative development at 20° C was nearly twice as fast as at 10°C. After the plants had entered the reproductive phase, the difference in developmental rate became smaller. Plants grown at the lower temperature produced much higher total biological yields and grain yields than plants grown at the higher temperature. Percentage proportion of leaves was higher and proportion of culms lower at 20° C than at 10°C. Temperature had no significant effect on number of culms and 1000-grain weight. Number of grains per ear was higher at 10°C than at 20° C. Total biological yield per pot and grain yield per pot were larger when the plants were grown in dense populations. More culms and larger yields per individual plant were produced in sparse populations. Growth density did not affect the number of grains per ear. Length of ear and 1000-grain weight were larger in sparse than dense populations. Two-rowed barley varieties gave significantly higher total biological yields and slightly higher grain yields than multi-rowed varieties. There were no differences between the two types of barley in proportions of leaves, culms and roots. As expected, number of culms and 1000-grain weight were higher, and number of grains per ear was lower, in the two-rowed than in the multi-rowed varieties. Among the various yield components, number of culms explained most of the yield. The number of grains per ear explained a smaller proportion, and 1000-grain weight a larger proportion, of the yield of the two-rowed varieties than of that of the multirowed varieties. In both types of barley there was a significant positive correlation between number of culms and 1000-grain weight. The number of grains per ear was not correlated with the number of culms; neither was it correlated with 1000-grain weight. There were differences between the two-row and multi-row types in correlations between culm numbers, leaves and roots. The distribution of biological yield between various plant parts in different phases of development did not affect the grain yield.",

The quality was assessed from the stability of ascorbic acid and colour, the aroma number, and organoleptic evaluation. Storage lasted up to 8 months. It was established that the cloudiness exercised a slight protective effect on ascorbic acid. However, the instability of the cloud meant that the appearance of the cloudy juice was less attractive than that of the clear juice. No well-founded advantage of the cloudy juice could be demonstrated. Concentration proved less suitable, as there occurred harmful changes in ascorbic acid, colour and organoleptic properties. The freezing-drying method was excellent with respect to ascorbic acid and colour. In contrast, considerable losses in aroma occurred, with consequent weakening of the organoleptic properties. This method would be of advantage only in combination with aroma recovery, and solution of the financial problems involved. The results are discussed in the light of relevant literature.",

Toisaalta on kokeiltu ja otettu käyttöön lukuisia kokonaan uusia lajeja, toisaalta on moni jo aikaisemmin Saksassa viljelty laji saanut uutta merkitystä, kun on kehitetty uusia, oloihin paremmin soveltuvia jalosteita ja viljely- ja korjuumenetelmät ovat kehittyneet. Niinpä esim. maissi, jota on Saksassa viljelty jo toistasataa vuotta, on saavuttanut huomattavan viljelylaajuuden etenkin vihantarehukasvina (vuosittain n. 40000 – 50000 ha) sen jälkeen kun on ryhdytty viljelemään amerikkalaisia lajikkeita ja vastikään jalostettuja eurooppalaisia hybridejä. Korjuun koneistuminen on myös edistänyt maissin tuotantoa. Ilmastollisesti epäsuotuisilla alueilla ja happamilla mailla viljellään maissin sijasta kauraa, jonka viljely kypsäksi rehuviljaksi on nopeasti taantunut, mutta vihantarehukasvina voimakkaasti lisääntymässä. Kaikki kauralajikkeet, lukuunottamatta kaikkein lyhytkortisimpia ja vähälehtisimpiä leikkuupuintikauroja, soveltuvat tähän tarkoitukseen. Uusia lehteviä jalosteita on saatu italialaisesta raiheinästä ja kevätrapsista, ja myös mustasinappia (Brassica nigra) jalostetaan rehuominaisuuksia silmälläpitäen, öljyretikka (Raphanus sativus oleiformis) on saanut vankan jalansijan Saksan rehunviljelyssä, koska lajin verraten alhainen sinappiöljypitoisuus Sinapis- ja Brassica-lajeihin verrattuna on eduksi sekä karjan terveydelle että maidontuotannolle. Giessenissä on onnistuttu jalostuksella parantamaan öljyretikan laonkestävyyttä. Jo vanhastaan harjoitettu rehunauriinviljely on saamassa entistä tärkeämmän merkityksen uusien lehtevien jalosteiden ansiosta. Korjuumenetelmissä tapahtunut kehitys on lisännyt nauriin viljelyä säilörehuksi. Myös rehukaalin jalostus on tuottanut hyviä tuloksia. Aivan uusi rehukasvilaji, joka sodan jälkeen on saavuttanut Saksassa melkoisen viljelylaajuuden, on Aleksandrian apila (Trifolium alexandrinum), jota viljellään esim. seoksina italialaisen raiheinän kanssa. Kokeiltavina ja jalostettavina Giessenissä ovat myös Persian apila (Trifolium resupinatum), josta odotetaan kilpailijaa Aleksandrian apilalle, valkomesikkä (Melilotus albus), jonka rehuominaisuuksia pyritään parantamaan, sekä useat Lupinus- ja Lathyrus- lajit. Erilaiset hirssilajit ovat osoittautuneet niin paljon lämpöä vaativiksi, että niitä voidaan viljellä vain kaikkein lämpimimmillä seuduilla. Samoin on laita öljykurpitsan (Cucurbita pepo styriaca), joka viihtyy viininviljelyalueilla. Siitä samoin kuin auringonkukasta (Helianthus annuus) on Giessenissä myös kehitetty uusia lajikkeita.",

    "abstract": "In der Versuchsanlage Malminkartano der Universität Helsinki in Finnland wurde von Juni bis September 1962 und Ende März 1963 die Entwicklung der Blütenknospen und Samen von den Apfelsorten Åkerö, Lobo, Punakaneli, Sariola und Valkea kuulas in ihren einzelnen Entwicklungsschritten morphogenetisch geklärt. Die Untersuchungen, die sich ausserdem noch mit der Blütenentwicklung von Prunus padus L. befassten, brachten folgende Ergebnisse: Die Blütendifferenzierung setzte bei den fünf Apfelsorten zu verschiedenen Zeiten ein. Sie begann bei der Sorte Sariola bereits Mitte Juli, bei der Sorte Valkea kuulas Mitte August und bei den Sorten Punakaneli, Lobo und Åkerö Anfang September. Nur die Blütenknospen von der Sorte Sariola hatten zu Beginn des Winters das Stadium der Fruchtblattdifferenzierung erreicht und gingen auf einer Entwicklungsstufe in den Winter, auf der auch die Apfelknospen in Deutschland im Winter stehen. Die Knospen der anderen untersuchten Apfelknospen befanden sich im Winter auf niedereren Entwicklungsstufen. Bei den Blütenknospen von Prunus padus trat in Finnland eine starke Entwicklungsbeschleunigung auf. Vom Beginn der Blütendifferenzierung Ende Juli bis zum Stadium der Archesporbildung in den Antheren brauchten die Knospen nur 6 Wochen. In Deutschland durchliefen die Knospen von Prunus padus diesen Entwicklungsabschnitt in 3 Monaten. Im Winter standen die Blütenknospen von Prunus padus in Finnland und in Deutschland auf denselben Entwicklungsstufen. Eine vergleichende Betrachtung der gemeinsam am Apfelbaum stattfindenden Embryo-, Samen- und Fruchtgenese einerseits und der Blütenentwicklung andererseits ergab, dass die Fruchtfallperiode stets einsetzte, wenn der Embryo in den Samen im Globularstadium stand. Bei der Sorte Sariola begann ausserdem noch während der Fruchtfallperiode in den Knospen die Blütendifferenzierung. Bei der Sorte Åkerö fing die Blütendifferenzierung 5 Wochen später an, als die Embryonen in den Samen ihr Wachstum abgeschlossen hatten.",

    "abstract": "The quality properties of black-currant have been investigated in respect of 12 home-grown varieties. Samples were obtained from 6 localities over a period of 3 years. The properties studied were dry matter, pectin and its degree of esterification, acid content, colour strength, and formol value. As regards dry matter, the differences between the varieties were small. A high summer temperature diminished the dry matter values. Some variations existed between the varieties in respect of pectin. Thus Wellington XXX and X contained an abundant amount of pectin, whereas Brödtorp and Black of Lepaa contained little. A high summer temperature lowered the pectin content, but the degree of its esterification remained high. A corresponding effect was noted as a consequence of the degree of north latitude of the place of growth: the amount of pectin was increased and its degree of esterification was lowered towards the north. With respect to the acid content, differences were remarked among the varieties, corresponding approximately to results reported earlier in literature. As a rule, the acid content of the home-grown varieties is higher than the values so reported. Of weather factors, sunshine seems to exercise most influence on the acid content, the acid being increased by a lack of it. Similarly, differences among the varieties were found in colour strength. This property seems to bear a negative correlation to the berry size, since the colouring compounds are localized in the skin part of the berry. The colour strength depends markedly upon the summer temperature, as is evidenced by both the comparison of the different years, and that of the different localities. Slight differences in the formed value were noted between the varieties. However, this value depends substantially upon the degree of maturity; it falls during ripening, a fact which renders comparison difficult.",

Twelve of the clones produced neither seedlings nor rhizomes. Rankings of the invasion potential based on the two reproduction modes did not correlate. The species known for their invasion potential in temperate or cool climates were among the highest ranking seedling producers in the common gardens. In the field experiment, the highest seedling production (73%) was found in the semi-dry moisture regime, followed by the dry (40%) and the moist (27%) regimes. In the greenhouse experiment, 83% of the studied clones and 84% of the species emerged. Temperature sum required for the production of viable seeds for one third of the studied species is reached at least every second year in latitudes 62–63°N.

Resources and entrepreneurial orientation are used to identify success perceptions. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were applied to the survey data of 805 Finnish family farmers. Family farmers rate their skills as good, and their abilities of proactiveness and self-realization success as high. The results suggest that both resources and entrepreneurial orientation affect the perceived success of family farmers, although the role of entrepreneurial orientation is relatively small. Co-variability between resources and entrepreneurial orientation is positive, addressingthe change towards the same direction. This study promotes the understanding of the family perspective and its role in the successful use of resources and entrepreneurial capabilities in farming and offers a developed construct for family farm business research.",

Second, our aim was to quantify the yield gap of these species in their main production regions. The analysis was based on comprehensive statistical data (2012–2021) modelled using a Bayesian approach. Time trends varied between plant species and regions. In carrot, the yield tended to remain similar. In onion, some statistically significant increasing regional time trends were found, whereas in white cabbage the significant time trends were mostly negative, indicating a decreasing yield. The yield gap was largest in onion, but its economic value was highest in carrot. To ensure profitable and sustainable production, it is necessary to reduce the yield variation and yield gaps. More efforts are needed to adapt to climate change and control production risks.",

When comparing median yields per ha, organic yields were on average 65% of conventional yields. The mean yield difference significantly differed between plant species. Among the analysed crops, faba bean performed best, gaining on average 84% of conventional yields, while organic cereals attained an average of 54–68% of conventional yields. The ratio of organic and conventional median yields was compared between geographical regions, and significant regional differences were found. The performance of organic cereals remained stable over the years, but the relative performance of the organic grain legumes, pea and faba bean, depended more on growing conditions. An average yield gap between the best-performing and medianfarms was 38% for organic farms and 28% for conventional farms.

The aim of this paper is to assess the opportunities for simultaneously enhancing carbon balance and variable profit of crop cultivation through altering the allocation of crop use in a regional scale. Using a numerical optimization model for mineral soils in southern Finland, results show that careful diversifying of crop cultivation can enhance both carbon balance and profit compared to the current allocation. Including the lifecycle carbon footprint of nitrogen fertilizers further increases potential gains. Variable profit can rise by 75–207 € ha-1 year-1, while carbon balance improves by 70–336 kg C ha-1 year-1, depending on the weighting of economic and climate outcomes. Changes can be made without significantly increasing fixed costs of cultivation. Optimal strategies include reducing spring crops and fodder grass while increasing nitrogen-fixing grasses and high-profit crops like clover grass, green manure, potato, and sugar beet. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of higher yields for enhanced outcomes, emphasizing the need to enhance forage grass, clover grass, and green manure yields for carbon balance and forage grass, potato, sugar beet, and spring crop yields for increased variable profit. Investments in infrastructure, marketing, and innovative food products are essential to promote local crop diversity and incentivize farmers to utilize and test new crops on a farm.",

The pH of the titration suspensions ranged in soil 1 from 5.6 to 3.3, in soil 2 from 7.2 to 4.7. The exchange reaction with base cations on variable charge sites was an important mechanism for H+ inactivation. The quantities of cation equivalents released were, however, lower than the proton equivalents added. Calcium dominated the supernatant solutions, but as related to exchangeable reserves. Mg seemed to be more susceptible to acidification at high soil pH. Protons were also consumed in the mobilization of divalent base cations from a non-exchangeable pool to an exchangeable one. The experimental soils differed in their response of acid cation fractions to proton loading. In the rather neutral soil 2, the quantities of soluble and exchangeable acid cations were very low and not affected by acidification. The Al dissolved by proton attack was immobilized by complexation reactions. This mechanism did not operate in the acid soil 1 where the proton loading markedly increased the exchangeable Al pool and, consequently, the soluble Al in the supernatant solution. This was associated with a simultaneous reduction in the complexed Al and a small increase in complexed Fe. Furthermore, acidification diminished the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) decisively less in soil 1 than in soil 2, because the increase in exchangeable Al markedly compensated the reduction in the exchangeable base cations. As compared to freelydrained systems, the batch titration overestimated the release of Al to solution phase.",

In 1990-1992, 114 characterized fungal, 59 uncharacterized bacterial and 12 uncharacterized actinomycetal isolates were extracted from samples of seed intended for use in malting. When the yield of the plant hormone, indole-3-acetic acid (lAA), from enriched microbial cultures was weighed against the microbial biomass and the endogenous lAA concentration of the barley harvests, it was concluded that potential exists for bacterial lAA production in biologically significant amounts, given some minor annual variations. As expected from the average rainfall and temperature during the growing season, microbial counts in all cultivars were highest in 1992. Most of the fungal species found were of saphrophytic character, and field fungi were dominant in the samples. On the whole, microbial counts and spectra in all samples confirmed that each harvest of all cultivars was of good vigour and well suited for malting purposes. Strains of plant pathogenic character included species of Septoria nodorum (Berk) Berk, Drechlera teres (Sacc) Subraim &amp; Jain, D. sorokiniana (Sacc) Subram &amp; Jain and D. graminea (Rab.)

In pure culture studies performed with a turbidometric method in MRS broth, non-starter lactic acid bacteria isolated from sausages were found to be more sensitive to acidic conditions than the starter strains used in the study. The addition of 2% histidine to MRS broth resulted in a tremendous increase in histamine production (from 1-2 to 6000 ppm). However, in histidine-fortified MRS broth with GDL addition, only 54 ppm of histamine was formed. According to these results, the pH decrease caused by GDL addition decreases histamine formation in dry sausages and in MRS broth. The differences in pH decrease may be one reason for the very varying concentrations of histamine detected in retail dry sausages.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to relate estimated breeding values (EBVs) of the parents’ 305-days protein production and the bull dam herd-year characteristics to the empirical bias in pedigree indices (difference between the pedigree index and the final proof) of young bulls. Two animal model evaluations were carried out; one included records up to 1990 and the other up to spring 1992. The final data set included 242 bulls with pedigree indices, final proofs, parents’ EBVs, production and herd information (the size, the average production and the intraherd standard deviation) of the dams. The average empirical bias in pedigree indices was 13.6 kg. The correlation between the final proof of the bull and the EBVs of the bull sire or dam were 0.45 and 0.17, respectively. The low correlation with bull dam EBV indicates the unreliability of the bull dam EBVs. Size of the herd and the standard deviation of production in the herd when bull dam produced its third lactation were correlated with the empirical bias in pedigree index. Pedigree indices of the bulls coming from small herds with high intraherd standard deviation were more biased than those from the big herds with low intraherd standard deviation. The best bulls, when grouped according to their final proofs, were sons of the highest EBV sires. EBVs of bull dams did not differ in the highest and the lowest final proof groups, but the dams of the best bull group had a higher first lactation record than the dams of the other bull groups.",

The results were compared to the quantities of exchangeable, reducible (three methods) and total Mn of the soil samples as well as to Mn uptake in a pot experiment in which four yields of ryegrass were grown. MnAAAc-EDTA ranged from 1.8 to 158.8 mg/kg, mean 32.2 mg/kg. MnAAAc-EDTA correlated more closely with reducible Mn (r = 0.82*** -0.87***) than with total Mn (r = 0.50***) or exchangeable Mn (r = 0.45***), suggesting a relationship between reducible Mn and MnAAAc-EDTA. In order to take into account the effect of pH on plant-availability of MnAAAc-EDTA, the MnAAAc-EDTA indices were multiplied by two different pH correction coefficients. The pH correction resulted in a closer correlation between MnAAAc-EDTA and exchangeable Mn, but in a poorer correlation between MnAAAc-EDTA and reducible Mn. The pH-corrected MnAAAc-EDTA indices or exchangeable Mn explained the variation in the Mn content of the first ryegrass yield to a higher degree (R2 = 33—38 %) than did the original indices (R2 = 3 %). However, the original indices explained 38—55 % of the variation in the Mn content of subsequent ryegrass yields, whereas the pH-corrected indices explained only 16—34 % of the variation. Thus, MnAAAc-EDTA is an indicator of the potentially plant-available reserves of Mn, while the pH-corrected indices reflect the quantity of the readily available Mn in the soil.",

The treatments were: concentrate mixture with no added fat (control); in the test feeds, some of the barley was replaced with 5 % of a fat source plus 10 % wheat bran, 1 % wheat molasses and 1 % Ca-lignosulphonate. The fat sources were rapeseed oil (RSO), calcium salt palm fatty acids (CaSFA), or tallow (TS). These four concentrate mixtures were fed to growing bulls with hay (45:55) at a rate of 85 g dry matter kg-1 metabolic body weight (W0.75). Partial replacement of barley with different fat sources slightly decreased dry matter intake and thereby reduced the daily intake of estimated metabolizable energy in all fat containing diets. Average daily weight gain was 1.20; 1.05; 1.05 and 1.08 kg for the control as to RSO; CaSFA and TS, respectively. Carcass weight was similar for all fat sources but slightly higher for the control diet, while dressing percentage was slightly lower for the control diet. Feeding RSO, TS or CaSFA had no effect on feed conversion efficiency in comparison to the control. No apparent difference was observed between treatments on carcass quality and palatability scores of the meat. Oleic and stearic acids were increased for RSO and TS containing diets as compared to the control and CaSFA containing diets.",

The second part of the investigation involved the greenhouse study of the development of the same three varieties together with the northern type Norwegian variety Engmo and southern type Swedish line Sv. 0873. The development and growth of the three Finnish timothy varieties had similar dry matter and protein production capabilities. The Tammisto variety exhibited rather demanding requirements for growth factors and had regression coefficients greater than one for both dry matter and protein production. The Nokka variety can be classified as a general variety on the basis of its dry matter production, and a well thriving variety with a low level of growth factors on the basis of its raw protein production. The Nokka regression coefficients were approximately one and less than one for dry matter and protein production respectively. The Tarmo variety in regard to energy and protein production is considered a modest variety which had the lowest regression coefficient of the three varieties. Tarmo variety and Svalöv line Sv. 0873 had exceptionally slow primary development. In later growing stages, however, these same two varieties developed faster than the others. The regrowth capabilities of the Sv. 0873 line and the Engmo variety were weaker than those of the Finnish varieties. The Engmo variety, suited for northern conditions, had the largest root production whereas Sv. 0873, bred for southern conditions, had the weakest. The Engmo variety’s large root production promoted fast LAI development. Seeding depth had significance only in the first cutting. The size of the regrowth yield was primarily influenced by the size of the previous cutting. The yields of consecutive cuttings were negatively correlated.",

The management techniques studied were the number of cuttings and the density of stand establishment. The variety used was Danish Isis-Daenfeldt. The maximum DM yield was obtained from a seeding rate of 20 kg/ha. The maximum DM yield produced under the favourable growing conditions in 1973 was 5. 7 tons/ha and under the less favourable conditions in 1974 3.3 tons/ha. No more than two cuts in the year of seeding are recommended. The radiation used by lucerne was 0.3—0.5 %of the total radiation reaching the surface. A 10% decrease in radiation in 1974 resulted in a 50 % decrease in photosynthetic activity mainly due to differences in temperature and overabundant precipitation. The optimum LAI was obtained from seedingrates ≥5 kg/ha. From seeding to emergence a temperature sum of 120 °C is needed and from seeding to flowering a sum of 800°C. From cutting to the next flowering a sum of 600— 700°C is needed. Three cuts provided forage 6.3 % units more digestible than two cuts. Root carbohydrate levels suggest that the last cut should not be made later than mid-August.",

Using a two-stage model, we investigate whether advertising has increased the demand for milk. No effect of advertising on the demand for non-alcoholic beverages is found in the first stage. In the second stage, an almost ideal demand system including advertising expenditures on competing beverages is estimated. The effects of generic advertising within the beverage group are positive and significant for whole milk and negative and significant for lower fat milk. The own-advertising elasticity for the combined fluid milk group is 0.0008. This highly inelastic elasticity suggests that increased advertising will not be profitable for the producers. Several cross-advertising effects are statistically significant, emphasizing the usefulness of a demand system approach.",

Tutkimusalueella pakettipeltopalstat ovat enimmäkseen suhteellisen pienialaisia, avo-ojin varustettuja ja nurmen jälkeen paketoituja. Palstat sijaitsevat yleensä erillään muista pelloista, ja ne näkyvät useimmiten korkeintaan yhteen asumukseen. Yleiselle maantielle niistä näkyy hieman alle puolet ja vesialueelle vajaa kolmannes. Valtaosalla tiloista asutaan vakituisesti, ja ainakin osan vuotta asuttuna niistä on 91.7 %. Pellonvarauslain suomia peltojen käyttömahdollisuuksia on alueella käytetty hyväksi vähän, vain palstojen metsittäminen ja kotitarveperunan ja -juureksien viljely olivat jokseenkin yleisiä käyttötapoja. Noin puolella palstoista oli ollut jonkinlaista käyttöä kesällä 1974. Metsitys oli useimmiten kohdistunut pienimpiin ja syrjäisimpiin palstoihin, mikä onkin hyvin pellonvarauslain hengen mukaista. Muu käyttö kohdistui lähinnä tiloille, joilla oli muutakin toimintaa, ja palstoille, jotka sijaitsivat edullisesti. Niinpä laiduntaminen kohdistui usein palstoihin, joille oli kylvetty nurmi ja joita muutenkin hoidettiin, ja kotitarveviljely puolestaan asuttujen tilojen lähellä päärakennusta sijainneisiin palstoihin. Suurinta osaa pakettipelloista ei hoidettu mitenkään vuonna 1974. Yleisin hoitomenetelmä oli niitto — lähes kolmannes palstoista niitettiin. Pieni osa niistä kynnettiin, ja joitakin palstoja kulotettiin tai käsiteltiin torjunta-aineilla. Noin viidesosalle palstoista oli kylvetty nurmi paketointiaikana. Hoitotoimenpiteet, varsinkin niitto, ajoittuivat kuitenkin yleensä huonosti rikkakasvien leviämistä ajatellen.

    "abstract": "In the feeding experiments performed at the Biochemical Research Institute with test cows (the so-called 0-cows) the biosynthesis of milk component from different energy sources and from urea used as the nitrogen source was studied. The basic idea was to elucidate the effect of various feed components and substances formed in rumen fermentation on the biosynthesis of milk components. In the studies preparations labelled with 15N and 14C were used. The feed of the test cows did not contain protein at all, the carbohydrates were hexose-based and fat in the form of oil was used very scantily. All the proteins required were synthesised by test cows in symbiosis with their rumen microbes from ammonium nitrogen which they obtained from urea and ammonium salts. Protozoa disappeared gradually from the rumen and the number of bacteria increased, becoming many tens of times the number in normally-fed cows. Of the substances labelled with 14C, stearic acid and acetic acid had the highest incorporation into the different milk components. Stearic acid is transferred to milk fat almost solely as such, but apparently is used for the formation of oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids as well. Acetic acid also is incorporated mainly into fat, though it is transferred in considerable amounts also to the other milk components. Propionic acid is by nature gluconeogenetic and butyric acid lipogenic. The carbon of sucrose and lactic acid is incorporated fairly evenly into the various milk components. The studies suggest that there are only very small amounts of aromatic compounds in 0-cow tissues. According to the relative retention times the components of milk are synthesised from the different energy sources at various rates. The syntheses of citric acid and lactose are the most rapid, those of protein and fat the slowest. The feeding has a marked effect on the composition of the milk fat. On the basis of these experiments, the far-developed urea feeding does not seem to have any pronounced effect on the participation of the substances studied in the biosynthesis of milk.",

The total amount (mg/1 urine) of the free amino acids was the smallest with 0-cows and the highest with NorP-cows on pasture feeding. The difference was mainly due to glycine ,which was found in significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) amounts with NorP-cows on pasture feeding. The proportion of glycine in the total identified free amino acids was 9.7 ± 9.0 % with 0-cows, 13.5 ± 5.1 % with ULP-cows, 7.7 ±3.4 % with NorP-cows on indoor feeding and 56.4 ±21.0 % with NorP-cows on pasture feeding. The corresponding figures for glutamic acid, which was quantitatively the most important amino acid with 0- and ULP-cows, were 36.5 ± 29.6 %, 19.8 ± 19.2 %, 5.7 ±4.0 % and 3.9 ± 2.1 % of the total free amino acids.

Cows were given 7—8 kg/d of concentrate, 2 kg/d of hay, and silage at almost ad lib. level. The intake of sugar alcohols was 484 g/d in Group I and total intake of sugars was 461, 736 and 435 g in Groups I, II and IIII, respectively. No polyols were secreted in the faeces, and in the urine only 0.7 % of the intake, most of which was xylitol, rhamnitol and arabinitol. Small amounts of polyols were also secreted in the urine of the molasses beet pulp group. There were no clear effects of polyol feeding on the apparent digestibility or utilization of minerals. However, the readily fermentable carbohydrates in the diet tends to increase the apparent absorption and utilization of magnesium. Secretion of potassium was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower in the polyol beet pulp group than in the molasses beet pulp group.",

In laboratory tests, the soil samples in lysimeter tubes were fertilised on the surface with amounts of copper corresponding to the amounts used in practice, after which the soils were irrigated with pure water. The results showed that copper added in EDTA form was leached through the soil columns to some extent during irrigation when the pH values of the soils had been raised to the 7.0—7.4 level by the addition of lime. The copper added in the form of copper lignosulphonate or copper sulphate was not leached through the columns. There was no difference in the distribution of copper in the soil columns after eluviation where the different sources of copper were concerned. The bulk of the copper remaining in the soil was found in the uppermost stratum 2.5 cm in depth. There was no difference between the four soil types in this respect. When the soil was analyzed immediately after eluviation, the copper retained in it was still in an acetate-EDTA extractable form irrespective of source compound.",

    "abstract": "The utilization of the non-protein nitrogen and carbon of feed by rumen microorganisms for the synthesis of protein was studied by administering [U-14C] sucrose and 15NH4Cl to a cow on urea-rich, low-protein feed. By studying the labelling of the protozoa and bacteria and the amino acids isolated from them at intervals up to 48 hours afterwards, it was found that the bacteria synthesized amino acids from nonprotein nitrogen much more rapidly and effectively than the protozoa. Also the labelling of the carbon in the amino acids of the bacteria was more rapid than in the protozoa. In both protozoa and bacteria there was intracellular storage of [14C] sucrose. Of the bacterial amino acids the most vigorous 14C labelling was found in Glu, Arg, Lys, Val and Ala and the weakest labelling in Gly, His and Ser. Of the protozoal amino acids Ala, Asp, Glu, Leu and Lys had the highest labelling and Pro, Gly, His and Phe the lowest. In the bacterial protein the labelling of Pro and Arg was ten times that of the corresponding protozoal amino acids, and Asp, Ser and Ala four times. After the 15NH4Cl dose the half-life of 15N in the rumen fluid was estimated to be 3.3 h. Labelled ammonium nitrogen was about 11 —15 % of the bacterial nitrogen and 2—3 % of the protozoal nitrogen after 1 h. Of the protozoal amino acids Ala, Glu, Val, Asp and Met had the most vigorous labelling, and of the bacterial amino acids Glu, Asp, Ser, He and Tyr. The slowest incorporation of ammonium nitrogen was into His, Pro, Arg and Gly in both bacteria and protozoa. The labelling of the bacterial amino acids was approximately 7—8 times more vigorous than that of the protozoal amino acids. The labelling of Ala was only 4 times, and that of Val, Met and Glu 5 times more vigorous than with protozoal protein. The pathway of histidine synthesis seemed to be restricted in both bacteria and protozoa and therefore may be a limiting factor in protein synthesis, particularly in cows fed urea as the sole source of nitrogen. Of the 14C and 15N label given, 12.9 and 9 % respectively was secreted in the milk during the first 3 days; over the same period the 14C and 15N excreted in the faeces plus urine accounted for 16.9 and 44.3 % respectively of that administered.",

As the times became shorter, below 15 ... 20 cmin, there was a sharp decline in the relative measuring accuracy.

The measuring accuracy of watches with pointer display improved if the pointer could be stopped at the moment of measuring and the result read out afterwards. The variables describing the characteristics of the test person, e.g. age, basic schooling, degree of training and intelligence, were correlated with the measuring accuracy. The measuring of times did not seem to require special techno-mechanical talent. With the aid of variables that describe the characteristics of the test persons and that can be determined in a simple manner it is not possible to give a reliable estimate as to how well a specific person is suited to the task of a time investigator. This problem may be solved by using, for example, a work test based on simulation.",

This fungus did not inhibit healing of the wounds, indeed it appeared to reduce the incidence of B. cinerea wound infection. The wounds contained 19 other fungal species and genera of no pathogenic importance. In a colder-than-average autumn, B. cinerea infection was more severe, and dieback during the subsequent season more extensive than usual. A methyl thiophanate application made in a cold autumn after harvesting reduced the incidence of B. cinerea in wounds, and little dieback resulted the following year. In mild autumns maneb and dichlofluanid reduced dieback, too. When the harvesting was followed by a cold autumn, mechanical harvesting reduced the following year’s yield compared with hand-picking.",

All cows were either dry and pregnant or lactating and nonpregnant. Compared to values obtained during the dry period, the serum calcium level was only slightly lower shortly after calving. The calcium level increased in the vitamin D treated cows during the ascending phase of lactation, whereas both the calcium and inorganic phosphorus levels remained relatively low in the control cows, respectively. The highest mean magnesium levels occurred during the 2nd and 3rd weeks of lactation. The serum calcium level was higher during the grazing period than during the indoor feeding period. Inorganic phosphorus remained at a relatively high level in younger cows during the grazing period, whereas a significant decrease was noted in the phosphorus level of older cows, respectively. The lowest magnesium values were noted in May, i.e. already before the beginning of the pasture season, the concentration increasing towards the end of the grazing period especially in younger cows. As a whole, younger cows had slightly higher mean serum calcium and magnesium levels and significantly higher inorganic phosphorus levels compared to older cows. The effect of age on the inorg. phosphorus level appeared to be more marked in dry cows and during the grazing period than in lactating cows and during the winter feeding period.

The algorithms used in the agronomical models were obtained from the regression analysis of numerous field experiments. The calculated new agronomical values serve as a basis for the application of economic models. GIS and modelling remain as two separate systems with the capacity for information exchange between them. Profitability of barley cultivation varied in a very broad range in the study area. The optimal fertiliser amounts established for each field allow increasing crop productivity in the region and at the same time preventing environmental pollution due to production intensification. The proposed decision support system can be further supplemented by several agro-economic models and implemented throughout Estonia.;",

    "abstract": "A successive alkalinity producing system (SAPS) has been investigated as a potential passive treatment option for acid, metal containing runoff from acid sulphate soil. A pilot-scale system was installed at an agricultural land site in Rintala embankment area in mid-western Finland. The experimental layout consists of three parallel treatment units: two different SAPS cells and one limestone-filled cell for comparison of performance. The SAPS cells are composed of a bottom layer of limestone and a top layer of compost supplemented with sand. One of the SAPS cells contains sulphate-rich, waste gypsum mixed with the compost layer in order to enhance the metal reduction by sulphate reducing-bacteria. Over a 3 year period on average between 612 l min-1 of water from a nearby drain receiving acid drainage was directed to the system. The quality of the influent water was highly variable: pH 4.17.1, aluminium 0.06129 mg l-1, iron 0.04622 mg l-1, manganese 1.923 mg l-1. Flow through the cells increased the pH and decreased the acidity and concentrations of Al and Fe. Manganese concentrations did not change significantly (P < 0.05, paired t-test) in any of the treatment cells. The current results do not demonstrate the advantages of a SAPS system when compared to a limestone bed and the present implementation is not considered to be an effective treatment method for acid drainage water. Therefore, to increase the alkalinity production of SAPS cells, the system will be modified to increase the contact time of water with limestone.;",

Histidine formed 36.1 per cent, tryptophane 25.0 per cent, and glycine 15.1 per cent of the total amount of free amino acids in the control sample. In connection with many other amino acids a decrease in their amounts was noted during storage. Changes appearing in refrigerated fish were more distinct than in frozen fish.",

    "abstract": "Kirjoittaja on aikaisemmin (VARO 1967) julkaissut alustavia tutkimustuloksia keinosiemennyskarjujen jälkeläisarvostelujen pysyvyydestä olosuhteissa, joissa jälkeläisryhmät on koottu tavallisissa tuotantosikaloissa kasvatetuista porsaista. Mainituissa tutkimuksissa oli teuraspainot korjattu aineiston keski-ikää ja muiden ominaisuuksien mittaluvut keskipainoa vastaaviksi. Nyt esitettävät tulokset on laskettu pienimmän neliösumman menetelmällä (HARVEY 1966), jossa teuraspainoa lukuunottamatta kaikista muuttujista on poistettu regressiomenetelmällä eri-ikäisyydestä ja eripainoisuudesta johtuva lisämuuntelu. Painoista poistettiin tietysti vain eri-ikäisyyden aiheuttama lisämuuntelu. Alustavissa tutkimuksissa oli ominaisuuksien riippuvuus iästä ja painosta todettu yleensä suoraviivaiseksi. Vain painon riippuvuus iästä on ollut nuorimmissa ikäluokissa lievästi käyräviivainen. Tämäkin yhteys on kuitenkin katsottu suoraviivaiseksi, koska nuorten, regressioviivalta poikkeavien, eläinten osuus on ollut hyvin pieni, vain n. 3 %. Tutkittujen jälkeläisten kokonaislukumäärä on ollut 2 275. Siitä oli 1 772 eli 78 % yorkshire- ja 503 eli 22 % suomalaista maatiaisrotua. Sukupuolisuhde oli molemmissa roduissa likimäärin sama, 43 % emakko- ja 57 % leikkoporsaita. Karjujen luku oli yhteensä 36 ja jälkeläisryhmien keskimääräinen porsasluku 63.2. Jälkeläisryhmät koostuivat keskimäärin 10.2 pahnueesta. Koko aineiston keski-ikä oli 177.8 päivää. Aineiston keskiarvot ja hajonnat sekä rotujen ja sukupuolten keskiarvot on esitetty taulukossa 1. Silava liha-suhde on laskettu piirroksessa kuvatun pienemmän silava-alan (S 2) perusteella, koska sitä on pidetty painoltaan vaihtelevassa kenttäaineistossa parempana kuin tavanomaista alaa (S 1), josta laskettu suhde asettaa pienet eläimet varsin epäedulliseen asemaan. Isien, samoin kuin sukupuoltenkin, osuus oli kaikkien ominaisuuksien muuntelussa erittäin merkitsevä, P < 0.001. Lukuunottamatta painoa ja silava–liha-suhdetta oli myös rotujen aiheuttama muuntelu erittäin merkitsevä. Kyljen pituuden muuntelussa oli rodun osuus suurempi kuin sukupuolen. Muihin ominaisuuksiin vaikuttivat sukupuolierot sen sijaan paljon voimakkaammin kuin rotuerot. Heritabiliteettikertoimien suuruutta arvioitaessa jätettiin ottamatta huomioon rodusta johtuva muuntelu, koska jalostusvalinta tapahtuu erikseen kummassakin rodussa. Samoin meneteltiin sukupuoli-, ikä- ja painoerojenkin suhteen, koska näistä syistä johtuva virhemuuntelu on arvostelussa pyritty poistamaan. Näin saadut heritabiliteettikertoimet on esitetty taulukossa 2. Kertoimia laskettaessa on isien välisen muuntelun osuus kokonaismuuntelusta kerrottu luvulla 3.69 tavanomaisen 4.00 asemasta. Tämä johtuu siitä, että jälkeläisryhmissä on ollut täyssisaruksia niin paljon, että kutakin yksilöä on jouduttu vertaamaan keskimäärin 5.2 täyssisarukseen ja 57.0 puolisisarukseen. Keskivirheet on laskettu ROBERTSONin (1959) likimääräisellä menetelmällä. Heritabiliteettikertoimet ovat pienempiä kuin koeasemaolosuhteissa lasketut. Eräät kirjoittajan (VARO 1962 ja VARO ja PARTANEN 1965) aikaisemmin suomalaisen yorkshireaineiston kantakoetuloksista laskemat kertoimet on koottu vertailun vuoksi taulukkoon 3 nyt saatujen tulosten rinnalle. Silavan paksuuden, kyljen pituuden ja kinkkujen pistearvostelujen kertoimet ovat täysin vertailukelpoisia, koska ne perustuvat samoihin mittoihin. Sen sijaan ei voi verrata kenttäarvostelussa laskettua teuraspainon heritabiliteettia vastaavaan koeasema-arvostelun kertoimeen, koska kantakokeissa porsaat kasvatetaan samanpainoisiksi. Kenttäarvostelussa teuraspaino on lähinnä kasvun mitta, ja sen vuoksi on painon heritabiliteettikertoimen rinnalle otettu koeasema-arvosteluista kasvun ja teurastusiän tai ruokintapäivien luvun kertoimet. Kun vertailu suoritetaan tällä tavoin, havaitaan, että vaikka kertoimet jäävätkin kenttäolosuhteissa paljon pienemmiksi kuin koeasemilla, on niiden suuruusjärjestys varsin yhdenmukainen. Heritabiliteettikertoimien pienuudesta huolimatta päästään karjujen jälkeläisarvostelussa kuitenkin varsin suureen luotettavuuteen, mikäli jälkeläisten lukumäärä voidaan pitää vähintään yhtä suurena kuin se on ollut selostetuissa tutkimuksissa. Jos luotettavuutta arvioidaan kaavasta b = [n * (1 / 3.69) * h2] / [1 + (n - 1) * (1 / 3.69) * h2] saadaan jälkeläisarvostelun varmuuskertoimiksi eri ominaisuuksille teuraspaino 0.81, selkäsilava 0.88, kyljen pituus 0.91, kyljyslihaksen ala 0.91, silavan ala 0.88, silava-liha-suhde 0.90, kinkku 0.70. On todennäköistä, että luotettavuutta voitaisiin vieläkin lisätä vähentämällä samasta pahnueesta merkittävien porsaiden lukua jälkeläisryhmien suuruutta vähentämättä.",

In Helsinki, in Südfinnland, liegen Blütendifferenzierung und der grösste Teil der Blütenentwicklung noch in der Vegetationsperiode von August bis Anfang Oktober. In den Wintermonaten vollziehen sich weitere Entwicklungsschritte. In Rovaniemi, am Polarkreis, ist die vegetative Wachstumsperiode im extremen Langtag ausgeprägter als in Helsinki. Sie schliesst erst am Ende der Vegetationsperiode ab und die Triebenden verholzen oft ungenügend. Die Blütendifferenzierung setzt wenige Tage vor dem kurzen Herbst ein. Die Blütenanlagen gehen auf sehr niederen Entwicklungsstufen in den Winter. Die jüngsten Blütenanlagen aus der Endzone der Infloreszenz sterben im Winter ab. Die Hauptphase der Blütenentwicklung liegt im Frühsommer des folgenden Jahres. Im Winter besteht keine gesicherte Weiterentwicklung der Blütenprimordien.

    "abstract": "The frost-resistance of Finnish red clover has been studied by means of experiments in a cold cabinet and on the basis of samples taken from the field. In the cold cabinet experiments the frost injury of the clover plant’s vegetative parts has reached considerable magnitude when the temperature was about 4° C. Also the unripe heads which did not die immediately could suffer so that the development of the seed stopped. Definitive death of the plants began to occur in the treatment at 5° C, though only when the soil was frozen. The plants recovered after treatment at 10° C if the soil was not frozen. In the field little frost injury of the vegetative parts occurred even with a frost of 6 to 7° C, but the unripe seeds suffered injury in that case. The germination percentage is distinctly dependent on the seed size in absence of frost. The stage of development at which more than 70 % of the corollae are light brown constituted an intermediate phase where the variation in germinative ability was great and covered, when the samples subjected to slight natural frost (–6.6° C) were taken into account, practically the entire per cent range (0—99 %). After the corollae of the heads had turned dark brown, at which time the seed had reached full weight, the seed suffered no injury from –6 to –7° C frost, and even more severe frosts could at the most cause a very slight lowering of germination percentage. Frost seems to injure the seed mainly by stopping the development of the unripe seeds. No lowering of germination from the level corresponding to the seed size has been observed in all cases nor was there any complete loss of germinative ability such as occurs with cereals. The commercial value of frost-injured red clover seed can be considerably increased by sorting. The number of hard seeds is highest in large, early harvested seed. Frost evidently causes »softening» of germinative seeds. The risk implied by frost is less in clover seed cultivation than in the cultivation of spring cereals and potatoes.",

Utsädesbetningen sker huvudsakligen med medel av alkoxialkyl-(etyl-)typ, vilka effektivt skyddar mot angrepp av de nu viktiga stråsädparasiterna Helminthosporium gramineum, Tilletia tritici, Ustilago avenae och U. hordei, likaså mot jord- och utsädesburen Fusarium-smitta. Användningen av de för sitt hot mot faunan kritiserade alkyl-(metyl-)kvicksilverpreparaten, förbjudna sedan 1969, har varit ringa, och utgjorde 1956—68 endast 5 % av samtliga kvicksilverbetningsmedel, beräknat enligt mängden aktiv substans (fig. 1). Den skarpa kritik, som på naturskyddshall riktades mot utsädesbetningen i början av 1960-talet, resulterade i att mången odlare avstod frän denna skyddsåtgärd. 1963 besåddes med kvicksilverbehandlat utsäde 640 000 ha eller 60% av stråsädarealen (fig. 2). Motsvarande värde 1967 utgjorde endast 245 000 ha eller 21 %. Till följd av denna markanta nedgång i utsädesbetningen bar förekomsten av H. gramineum och T. tritici ökat i oroväckande grad. Beräknat enligt mängden aktiv substans var totalförbrukningen av betningskvicksilver 1953—68 76 t eller 4.8 t per år. Av detta utgjordes 3.5 t respektive 0.2 t av alkylkvicksilver. Huvuddelen av betningskvicksilvret tillförs jordarna i södra och mellersta Finland, där 87 % av den odlade arealen återfinns.

    "abstract": "Future increase in precipitation in Scandinavia may exacerbate the dilemma of spring fieldwork that farmers have, concerning topsoil compaction versus delayed sowing on autumn ploughed soil. The former may lead to soil physical degradation, while the latter may lead to a shorter growing season, both with consequential loss of cereal yield potential. In order to enable farmers to adapt their spring fieldwork to climate change, research needs to include seedbed preparation at higher soil moisture conditions. A split-plot experiment in southeastern Norway in 2014–2017 explored the effects of timing (early, medium, late) and traffic intensity (zero, one, two or three additional wheelings) of spring fieldwork on soil physics and yield. Early spring fieldwork in the unfavourably wet conditions of 2016 gave rise to larger and stronger aggregates, higher penetration resistance, changed pore characteristics and reduced yields. Increased penetration resistance persisted until autumn. The small effect of traffic intensity was explained by location, soil type and intensity range involved. In this context of spring fieldwork timeliness, the proportion of 2–6 mm aggregates and penetration resistance were the properties most strongly correlated with other soil physical properties and cereal yield.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has concerned the scientific community since the 1970´s, stimulating research into its impacts, adaptation and mitigation. In 1988 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established to coordinate the research. The first scientific publications on the effects of climate change on agriculture and forestry in Finland appeared in the early 1980´s. After the launch of the Finnish Research Program on Climate Change (SILMU) in 1990, the number of climate-related projects and publications, and the input of Finnish researchers in the work of the IPCC started to increase. During the subsequent programs, the initial optimism about future crop production conditions changed into an awareness of the threats represented by climate change. Diversity of production and breeding of heat and flooding tolerant, disease resistant and nutrient-use efficient crop varieties were identified as being crucial for adaptation of agriculture. Efficient water management, measures to limit nutrient leaching and timely control of pests and pathogens are also crucial adaptation measures. Carbon storage in soils and biomass and reduced use of organic fields are suggested to be mitigation measures. By 2019, the awareness of the threats of climate change prompted citizens worldwide to demand action, and government programs have begun to include policies addressing reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "abstract": "Poorly crystalline Fe oxides are sources of Fe to plants. The adsorption of humic substances (HS) on these oxides alters its reactivity and stability in soils, and thus may affect Fe mobilization and uptake by plants from these compounds. This work aimed at studying how the adsorption of HS on Fe oxides affects its use as Fe source by two plant species with different Fe acquisition strategies, white lupin (Strategy I) and wheat (Strategy II). To this end, two completely randomized experiments, one with each plant, were carried out using a calcareous growing media and involving increasing amounts of HS adsorbed on ferrihydrite (0, 16, 60, and 97 mg C g–1) which was used as Fe source. The highest HS rate was the only treatment that significantly increased Fe uptake in wheat relative to control without HS. This was related to a decreased concentration of Fe in poorly crystalline oxides in the growing media. On the contrary, HS did not affect significantly Fe uptake by lupin. However, in this crop, the highest HS rate decreased the concentration of Fe in oxides relative to the lowest HS rate, without significant differences with other treatments. Thus, the effect of adsorbed HS on Fe uptake differed in two plants with different Fe acquisition strategies. The increased Fe uptake in wheat at the highest HS rate can be explained at least in part by an increased Fe mobilization from oxides by plant roots. These findings provide new insights on the role of soil organic matter on plant Fe nutrition.",

    "abstract": "To abate the environmental problems caused by the severe acidity and high metal concentrations in rivers draining acid sulphate (AS) soils of Western Finland, control drainage (CD) and lime filter drainage (LFD), and their combination, were investigated.The effectiveness of these best management practices (BMP's) on drainage water quality was studied on plot scale in two locations.In Ilmajoki, where the sulphidic materials are more than 2 m below the soil surface, CD efficiently reduced the concentrations of sulphate, aluminium, manganese and iron concentrations and to some extent also increased the pH of the drainage waters.LFD, in contrast, effectively reduced the drainage water acidity and raised the pH level.Decrease of the groundwater level owing to strong evapotranspiration in summer could, however, not be properly prevented by CD.In Mustasaari where sulphidic materials were as shallow as 1 m below soil surface, the positive effects of LFD recognised in Ilmajoki were hardly seen.This shows, that the tested BMP's work properly, and can thus be recommended, for intensively artificially drained AS soils like in Ilmajoki where most of the acidity has already been transported to watercourses.LFD can, however, not be recommended for as yet poorly leached and thus particularly problematic AS soils like in Mustasaari.This is, of course, a drawback of the tested BMP, as it is not effective for the soils which would need it most.The field data were tentatively utilised to test the performance of the HAPSU (Ionic Flow Model for Acid Sulphate Soils) simulation model developed to estimate the loads of harmful substances from AS soils.",

Furthermore, their correlation analysis was conducted to elucidate their changing patterns during germination and relationships with each other. The respiratory rate, free amino acids and ascorbic acid content were greatly enhanced by blue light compared to the darkness. Blue light could better retain glucosinolate content in cabbage sprouts than the darkness. More isothiocyanates formation was observed from cabbage sprouts under blue light, which was a result of the promoted myrosinase activity and higher glucosinolate content. These results indicate that blue light has selectively improved the nutritional compounds in germinated cabbage sprouts.",

In this study, we applied the contingent allocation method to a national agricultural budget to analyse the preferences of farmers and other citizens for allocating budget funds. Survey data collected from 2014 citizens and 518 farmers were used in compositional data analysis where it is considered that each spending decision bears an opportunity cost, and the decision maker faces trade-offs across budget priorities. The allocations of farmers and non-farmers were found to differ considerably. Farmers emphasized agricultural income and the economic resilience of farms as well as the self-sufficiency in food production and soil conditions. Non-farmers emphasized environmental public goods. The allocations were used to form compositional respondent clusters. The first cluster emphasised multiple objectives for agricultural policy, whereas the second cluster was clearly production oriented and the third cluster environmentally oriented. The results highlight the differences between farmers and non-farmers challenging the planning of legitimate agricultural policy.",

Since CNVs are structural variations of the genomethey potentially have a large effect on gene expression and protein function. We analyzed 1265 genotyped boarsfor nine different reproduction traits and identified 46 CNV regions encompassing 13 genes. 11 of the CNV regionswere shared between the breeds, 20 were unique to the Finnish Yorkshire and 15 to the Finnish Landrace. The genomewide association (GWAS) analysis identified zero to five reproduction associated genomic regions per trait.Furthermore, we identified 23 genomic regions with 20 candidate genes associated with fertility traits using GWASanalysis. The identified CNV regions were compared against GWAS regions to detect candidate regions with an effecton reproduction traits.

    "abstract": "On the initiative of the Department of Plant Husbandry of Agricultural Research Institute, experiments for destroying woody plants on fields and pastures were conducted in 1948—1949 with the following chemicals: Artificial hormones (sodium salt of 2,4-D, morpholine of 2,4-D, triethanolamine of 2,4-D, ethyl ester of 2,4-D, butyl ester of 2,4-D, and sodium salt of 2M-4K), potassium chlorate, and ammonium salt of dinitro-ortochresol. The substances Were applied in aqueous solutions, or as emulsions. Three different methods Were used: spray application to foliage, absorption through a cut branch, and application to soil. The following thicket-forming woody plants, common in Finland, were investigated: grey alder, Alnus incana (L.) Willd., willow, Salix sp., birch, Betula sp., mountain ash, Sorbus aucuparia L., and aspen, Populus tremula L. Following conclusions have been drawn from the experiments; It is possible, and, probably with the exception of aspen, even advisable to destroy small sprouts, 0.5—1.5 m. in height, of these woody plants by spraying their foliage with artificial hormones early in summer, especially if mechanical clearing machines cannot be used. Of the experimented substances, esters of 2,4-D proved the most effective in spray applications, but satisfactory results were even secured with other artificial hormones. For different species of woody plants the necessary concentration of the solution varies from 0.1 to 0.4 % of the active substance (p. 6). For dense thickets, 0.5—1.5 m. in height, the amount of solution used Was 1250—2000 l. per ha., applied by means of knapsack type of pressure sprayers. All branches must be sprayed. It is difficult to make the treatment effective enough, if only one application is made. Therefore it is important to conduct a new control spraying after 2—3 weeks. Treatment is most effective, if given in Warm, sunny weather. The best results are secured with spraying towards the end of June or at the beginning of July. If treated early in spring, many new sprouts develop on stems and branches; if treated late in summer, artificial hormones do not kill leaves effectively enough. The leaves of young sprouts and suckers die more readily than those of old tall trees and shrubs. It is possible to 2prevent the regeneration of alder almost completely by sprayings in one summer, if sprouts do not grow from the stumps of very tall trees. Willow, birch, mountain ash, and aspen often show slight regeneration in the following summer. The results obtained with sprayings with artificial hormones confirm with slight exceptions the results of earlier investigations (1, 4,5, 6, 12, 23, 24). It is possible to kill the leaves of sprouts by sprayings with chlorate and chresol, but such treatment does not prevent the development of new sprouts. Aqueous solutions of the investigated types of artificial hormones can be effectively applied to alders through a cut branch (fig. 9). Water-insoluble artificial hormones cannot be thus absorbed. Solutions of low concentrations are absorbed more easily than those of high concentrations. The amount of active substance used, however, is for the latter type greater than for the former. Relatively tall alders, and their roots, can thus be killed. But tall willows, birches, mountain ashes, and aspens are not killed, if the substance is applied to one branch only. The necessary amount of substance is even for alder so great that this method cannot be recommended for general practice. Solutions absorbed through cut branches are chiefly transported to different parts of the plant in the xylem. Because of the transpiration stream their translocation downwards in the xylem is very difficult. If transpiration stream, however, is prevented by cutting the stem above the absorbing branch, the substance travels vigorously towards the roots, at least in July and August. Based on this, it has been suggested that high thickets of sprouts (and suckers) as well as tall trees and shrubs, from whose stumps thickets develop, should be destroyed by applying artificial hormones to the stumps of cut plants. Thus it would not be necessary to pay attention to the transpiration stream, and active substance need not be wasted for destroying the above-ground parts of these plants. Possibilities of using this method must be further investigated. Also solutions of chlorate and chresol can be absorbed through cut branches into alders. It remains to be investigated whether this absorption is effective. Applications of the above-mentioned artificial hormones, chlorate, and chresol to the soil do not secure satisfactory results with regard to destruction of woody plants, at reasonable costs.",

    "abstract": "Work requirements for gathering of leaf fodder were investigated by using the following methods: 1) leaf fodder was gathered in ordinary way into bunches about 1,2 m in length and 30 cm in diameter, dried and stored in barn, 2) leaf fodder was cut in 3—4 m long pieces, placed on drying-hurdle 1 and allowed to stay there until winter. The quantity of leaves to be gained was determined and the fodder analyzed both fresh and dried. On the basis of the analyses the feed unit value and content of digestible protein were calculated. The chief results were as follows: The fresh bunches of leaf fodder contained 45 % leaves and 55 % undershrub; the air-dry bunches 43 % leaves and 57 % undershrub. In the course of drying the bunches lost about 50 % of their weight, the loss being approximately the same in regard to leaves and undershrub. The chemical composition of the dry matter of alder and birch leaf was approximately equal to that of good clover-hay, the former having, however, a higher protein content. During drying and storing changes took place in the composition of the leaf dry matter, N-free extracts and raw fat were decreased while fibre and protein were increased, the last mentioned in a considerable degree. The change in the leaf fodder stored upon hurdle was more distinct than in fodder bound in bunches. These changes indicate that nutritive losses have occurred in the leaves during storage and especially in the hurdle method these losses have been heavy. On the basis of the analyses it was calculated that 100 kg of dry (85 % dry matter) stripped leaves of alder make 43 f.u. and the same quantity of birch leaves 46 f.u. Accordingly 100 kg of fresh bunches of leaf fodder contained 8 f.u. and 100 kg of dry bunches 16 f.u. Dry leaves of alder contained 9,1 % digestible pure protein and those of birch 7,3 %. Gathering of bunches required 86,2 minutes of efficient working time per 100 kg of fresh leaf fodder. The average work output in a 10 hour day was 114 pieces of 5 kg bunches corresponding to about 44 f.u. The transport to barn required besides 16,9 min. of man work and 12,0 min. of horse work per 100 kg of fresh bunches. The efficient working time required for the making of hurdles was 63,4 min. per the amout of leaf fodder which corresponded to 100 kg of fresh bunches or some 30 % less than for the gathering of bunches. The leaf fodder stored on the hurdles lost its green colour before winter, turned dark brown and was reluctantly eaten by sheep. In the bunches the leaves remained green and were readily eaten. It is likely that the nutritive losses and the subsequent deterioration of the leaves involved in the hurdle method are so great that this procedure dan hardly be recommended although the work reserve is considerable compared with that in the gathering of bunches and no storage room is required.",

    "abstract": "Tässä työssä on tutkittu elävän ja eri olosuhteissa varastoidun sillin bakteeripitoisuutta. Elävän kalan iholla tavattiin bakteereita 300.000—700.000 kpl/g, mutta lihaskudos osoittautui steriliksi. Huoneen lämpötilassa (10—14° C) silli pilaantui jo parissa vuorokaudessa (laskettu pyyntihetkestä) ja kellarin lämpötilassa (0 — 2° C) noin 3—4 vuorokaudessa. Kala, jonka lihaskudos sisältää 1000—2000 bakteeria grammassa, haisee pilaantuneelta (Taulukko 2). NaCl-konsentraation vaikutus sillin bakteeripitoisuuteen näkyy taulukosta 3. Alle 20 % suolaliuos ei kykene estämään kalan pilaantumista. 20 %:ssa ja sitä väkevimmissä NaCl-konsentraatioissa lihaskudoksen bakteeripitoisuus nousee aluksi, mutta laskee sen mukaan kuin suola ehtii imeytyä kudokseen. Kyllästetyssä suolaliuoksessa tulee kalan lihaskudos steriliksi noin kahden kuukauden kuluessa. Huuhtelemalla kala eräillä antiseptisillä aineilla voidaan sen säilyvyyttä tuoreena ja lievästi suolattuna huomattavasti parantaa. Tässä työssä käytetyistä aineista ovat boorihappo, p-oksibentsoehappo ja bentsoehappo osoittautuneet tehokkaimmiksi. NaNO2:n vaikutus on ollut verrattain heikko (vert. Tarr) ja lisäksi se on aiheuttanut punertavan värin muodostumisen nahan alle. Bentsoehapon käyttöä haittaa sen huono liukenevuus. Oheisessa työssä on käytetty 0.5 ja 0.1 %:n liuoksia sekä 10 min. huuhtelu aikaa. Pidentämällä käsittelyä voidaan liuosten konsentraatioita vastaavasti pienentää.",

    "abstract": "The investigation comprised a number of different types of wheat and rye bread. They could be considered to represent the most common types of bread in Finland. A part of the flours were still of the standard conditioned by the war-time regulations, a part can be regarded as normal. Customary baking technique was employed. The vitamin content of the crumb and of the crust of the loaf were determined separately in each case. The bread types examined were as follows: Soft types of wheat bread 1. The so-called French bread (weight of the loaf 400 g., volume 1530 ml., height 65 mm., length 335 mm., breadth 90 mm.) made from half-white wheat flour of war-time qaulity (ash content 0.85 %, dry basis). 2. The so-called yeast bread, leavened with yeast, round loaf (weight 446 g., volume 920 ml., height 65 mm., diameter 145 mm.) made from dark high-extraction flour (mill stream BM3, ash content 4.00 %). 3. Yeast bread, round loaf (weight 389 g., volume 730 ml., height 67 mm., diameter 135 mm.) from the same flour as the previous one (2) but vitaminized with thiamine hydrochloride. 4. Whole-meal yeast bread, round loaf (height 60 mm., diameter 158 mm.). 5. Sweet bread (weight of the loaf 460 g., height 55 mm., length 330 mm., breadth 100 mm.) made from fine white flour (mill stream 82, ash content 0.70 %). In addition to flour, the dough contained 3.5 % eggs, 13 % butter, 10 % sugar, 1 %*salt, 3 % yeast ,35 % milk, and 5 % water colculated on the weight of flour. Soft types of rye bread 6. Whole-meal sour bread, leavened with acid ferment, round loaf (height 60 mm., diameter 143 mm.). 7. Whole-meal sour bread, leavened with acid ferment, round loaf with a hole in the centre (weight 378 g., volume 580 ml., height 24 mm., diameter 195 mm.) 8. Whole-meal bread, leavened with yeast, round loaf) weight 370 g., volume 530 ml., height mm., diameter 143 mm.). 9. Strongly fermented bread (height of the loaf 70 mm., diam. 193 mm.) made from a mixture of rye whole-meal and high-extraction wheat flour (97; 3). 10. Sour bread (weight of the loaf 470 g., volume 645 ml., height 55 mm., diam. 146 mm.) made from a mixture of rye whole-meal and high-extraction wheat flour (85 : 15). Hard thin bread (crisp bread) 11. Whole-meal wheat bread, leavened with yeast (thickness of the loaf 9 mm., diam. 230 mm water content 8.4 %) (same dough as in n:o 4). 12. Sout bread from a mixture of rye whole-meal and highextraction wheat flour (same as no. 9) (thickness of the loaf 6 mm., diam. 230 mm., water content 9.1 %). 13. Whole-meal rye bread, leavened with yeast, commercial quality (Elanto's bakery, size of the loaf 7,5x240x265 mm., water content 9.7 %). 14. Whole-meal rye bread, leavened with yeast, commercial quality (Elanto's bakery, size of the loaf 6.5x240x280 mm., water content 8.4 %). Customary baking procedure, adapted to each bread type, was followed. The additional ingredients were: common salt 1—2% and yeast 3 % of the weight of the flour. In making the sour bread (loaves nos. 6,7, 9, 10, 12) and acid ferment was used, instead of yeast, in 1.3—1.7 % of the weight of flour to raise the dough. The pH of the sour bread was 3.32—3.95. Baking was carried out in this laboratory, except that two of the hard thin loaves were made in a big Finnish bakery (Elanto). There the baking was performed in a wire-net travelling oven, the temperature being, with no 3, at the start 270°C and at the end 230°C, and with no 6, 280°C and 230°C respectively. The baking temperature of the wheat loaves was 225—240°C, that of the rye loaves 240—260°C Vitamin B1 was determined in the soft loaves, from which the crust could be removed, in the entire loaf, and besides, in the crumb and in the bottom and top crust separately. For this purpose the crust was very carefully removed from the loaf. It weighed 20—30 % of the total weight of the loaf. Determination of vitamin B1 was made according to the method of Feilenberg and Bernhard (9, 10). For the enzymatic hydrolysis diastase and papain were used and in some experiments cysteine for reduction of the disulphide form of thiamine. However, cysteine was not found to affect the results. Before oxidation to thiochrome the solution to be examined was purified by shaking it twice with 2.5 volumes of isobutanol (12). This because we had previously noted that the extracts of rye-meal and ryebread have a strong fluorescense of their own (19). The same is true of the extracts obtained from the crust of wheat bread. The method of Andrews and Nordgren (1) was also tested for determination of thiamine. The results obtained were in fairly good agreement with these obtained by the first mentioned method. The loss of vitamin B1 occuring in baking was 10—25 % of the initial amount (Table 2). In the group of soft wheat bread the loss was smaller (11 %) in the whole-meal loaves than in the others (16 —20 %). The difference between wheat and rye bread was not great. The loss was 15—25 % in the soft rye bread, or slightly higher than in the wheat bread. This may be due, for instance, to differences in the baking temperature or in the acidity. The loss was regularly greater in the crust of bread than in the crumb, in certain cases 3, even 4 times greater. In the bottom crust the loss was always greater than in the top crust. In particular, the attention was drawn to the fact that in the hard thin crisp bread which in fact consists of crust only, the losses of vitamin B1 were of the same order as in the corresponding soft-bread loaves. Thus, for instance, the loss was 11 % in a yeast bread loaf (no. 4) made from wheat whole-meal and 14 % in the hard thin loaf (no. 11) from the same material. In the loaf (no. 9) made from mixed rye meal the loss was 21 %, while in the corresponding crisp bread (loaf no. 12) it was 15 %- For the sake of comparison some data have been collected from the literature concerning the losses of thiamine in baking (Table 1).",

    "abstract": "The organic phosphorus in farm manure seems as such to be unavailable for plants. Therefore, the value of manure as a phosphorus fertilizer largely depends on the rapidity with which the mineralization of its organic phosphorus takes place. In fermenting manure the decomposition of organic phosphorus compounds will become more effective than their microbiological synthesis as soon as the amount of its organic phosphorus (P) exceeds circa 0.2 per cent of the manure dry matter (9). From thence a continual increase in the relative amount of inorganic phosphorus can be detected, until about 70 per cent of the total phosphorus occurs in inorganic form (8, p. 72). The largest part of the remaining organic phosphorus does not dissolve in ethanol, in water, or in N/2 hydrochloric acid, probably representing nucleic acid derivatives, or organic phosphorus combined with proteines (8). An incubation experiment performed with this insoluble residue of fractionation of a manure sample indicated a relatively slow mineralization of its phosphorus (Table 1). Addition of inorganic phosphorus and glucose in order to stimulate the microbiological activity did not remarkably increase the mineralization. No mineralization of the phosphorus in this fraction was found to take place in soil, neither any reliable increase in inorganic phosphorus could be detected when samples of manure were incubated in soil (Table 2). The technique used in these laboratory experiments was similar to that developed by Bower (2) and Pearson et. al. (11), except that instead of 1 N sulfuric acid 4 N sulfuric acid was used in extraction, because the latter was found to give relatively reliable results even when acid soils were in question (p. 110). Difficulties in the determination of changes in manure phosphorus in soil without the help of radioactive phosphorus were discussed. Since the mineralization of the in water and in N/2 hydrochloric acid insoluble organic phosphorus of manure seems to occur in soil very slowly, this fraction may not represent any available phosphorus source for plants, at least not during the first summer. The soluble organic phosphorus was found to be available food for microorganisms, and this was taken to mean that this fraction of manure phosphorus may take part in the active phosphorus cycle in soil. It has been claimed that the manure phosphorus does not become fixed by soil as rapidly as inorganic phosphates, and that it thus remains more available for plants than the latter (16, 18).This may be explained by the facts that the soluble humates of manure compete with phosphate anions for the exchange position of the adsorbing soil complex, or that the manure comes into soil in pieces which decrease the contact between manure phosphorus and soil particles. Results obtained from experiments where soil was shaken in water extract of manure and in potassium phosphate solution (Table 3), and where the solubility of the adsorbed phosphorus was determined (Table 4), did not indicate any protective action of soluble manure organic matter against the fixation of phosphorus by soil. Nor did manure increase the phosphorus concentration of soil extract more than superphosphate when equal amounts of soluble inorganic phosphorus in form of manure or of superphosphate were shaken with soil in water (Table 5). The adsorption of phosphorus on slightly acid soils seemed to be less efficient when samples of fermented manure were incubated with soil, and the amounts of water-soluble and N/2 acetic acid-soluble phosphorus determined in fresh samples taken at different intervals (Table 7). This proves how the occurrence of manure in lumps or pieces protects its phosphorus against fixation by soil. The acid soils seemed to fix even the manure phosphorus very efficiently, apparently owing to the rapid fixation by sesquioxides during extraction. Successive extractions of soil and of soil with manure (Table 6) showed that manure may be able to maintain for a short period a rather constant concentration of inorganic phosphorus, but that before long its remaining phosphorus becomes firmly fixed. Not only the solubility of manure phosphorus, but also its availability for plants was found to decrease on account of incubation in soil (Table 8). Owing to the fact that the difficultly soluble or insoluble organic phosphorus in farm manure seems to mobilize in soil very slowly, only the inorganic and perhaps the easily soluble organic phosphorus can be taken into consideration when the estimation of manure as a phosphorus fertilizer is in question. In Finnish farm manure there is, on the average, only 0.19 per cent P2O5 and about 60 per cent of it may occur in inorganic form (8). If the amount of soluble organic phosphorus, corresponding in fermented manure approximately 10 per cent of total phosphorus, is included, it can be calculated that 20 tons of farm manure contains about 25 kg. of available or easily mobilizable P2O5. Therefore, in order to provide phosphorus for maximum plant growth it is nearly always necessary to apply mineral phosphate fertilizers in addition to our farm manure.",

    "abstract": "Hinsichtlich der Frage, ob im Zuwachsvermögen der auf ein Gewicht von 90—100 kg gemästeten Säue und gleich schwerer kastrierter Eber oder Borge ein Unterschied besteht, begegnet man im Schrifttum (1, 2,3, 4) auseinandergehenden Auffassungen. Aus diesem Grunde und weil der Frage bedeutendes theoretisches wie auch praktisches Intresse zukommt, ist sie in der vorliegenden Untersuchung einer erneuten Betrachtung unterzogen worden. Als Untersuchungsstoff hat ein Material gedient, das im Laufe der Jahre zusammengekommen ist bei vergleichenden Versuchen, die an der Versuchsstation für Schweinewirtschaft über verschiedene Schweinestämme ausgeführt worden sind. In diese Versuche sind aus je vier Tieren bestehende Gruppen einbezogen; die zu ihnen gehörenden Ferkel entstammen demselben Wurf. Die Gruppen umfassen normalerweise 2 Säue und 2 Borge, die in derselben Bucht gepflegt werden und aus demselben Trog fressen. In Abstammung, Pflege und Fütterung bestehen also bei ihnen so gleichartige Wachstumsbedingungen, wie sie in der Praxis überhaupt angeordnet werden können. Die Tiere werden einmal wöchentlich gewogen und bei einem Gewicht von 00—100 kg geschlachtet. Für die statistische Behandlung wurden die Wägungsergebnisse der bis zum Jahre 1939 gezüchteten, im Vorfrühling geborenen Gruppen genommen, die 2 Säue und 2 Borge umfassten und deren Tiere alle bis zu einem Gewicht von 90—100 kg erzogen wurden. Es bestanden 100 Gruppen, die 200 Säue und 200 Borge zählten. Für beide Gruppen wurde eine gewöhnliche Korrelationstafel über die Wechselbeziehung zwischen Alter und Gewicht aufgestellt. Die mittleren Gewichte der Gruppen von je 200 Tieren in verschiedenem Alter gehen aus der Zusammenstellung auf S. 139 und aus dem Diagramm auf S. 140 hervor. Als Endergebnis der Untersuchung hat sich herausgestellt, dass die von denselben Eltern abstammenden, auf gleiche Weise gefütterten Säue und Borge 90 kg Gewicht oder Bacongewicht durchschnittlich gleich schnell erreichen, so dass das Zuwachsvermögen beider Geschlechter zum mindesten bei intensiver Fütterung in den 21—30 ersten Lebenswochen gleich ist.",

    "abstract": "In the years 1948—1950, experiments of carrot storage were conducted with Fusarex, a chemical manufactured by Bauer Products Ltd., at the Department of Plant Pathology of Agricultural Research Institute. Fusarex is prepared for use in potato storage, to prevent rotting and sprouting (3,4). The manufacturer also recommends it for root crops, though the writer of this paper has not found any information in literature about its usefulness for this purpose. Fusarex is a chemical in dust form, and as effective ingredient it contains 3 % of tetrachloronitrobenzene. The recommended dosage is about 0.5 kg. per 100 kg. Preliminary experiments on carrots were also conducted with Belvitan K, manufactured by Farbenfabriken Bayer. Like Fusarex, this chemical is used in dust form and it is prepared for use in potato storage. The recommended dosage of Belvitan K is 0.2 kg. per 100 kg. (1). No information concerning its ingredients is available. The storage sheds used in the experiments were fairly dry and well ventilated. The relative moisture of air varied from 70 to 95 %, temperature from 2 to 6° C. The chemicals were scattered over the carrots as uniformly as possible, in dosages recommended by the manufacturer. The effect of Fusarex was separately tested on sound carrots, on carrots damaged by maggots of Psila rosae Fabr., and on broken carrots. In sheds the carrots were placed in boxes, in some cases mixed with peat or sand. The walls of the boxes were either almost closed or had very large slits in them. The former boxes were used for experimental lots of 20 kg., the latter ones for lots of 4 kg. The storage period was about 6 months. Controls were made twice, after about 3 months’ storage in the middle of winter, and in spring at the end of storage period. At each control the carrots were weighed, and the diseased carrots were removed. In boxes with closed walls rotting of carrots was effectively prevented by Fusarex (cp.the picture 1, p. 86). Only 6—15 % of Fusarex-treated carrots were decayed, while the percentage was 25—71 for untreated carrots. In the preliminary experiment similar results were obtained with Belvitan K. On the other hand, rotting of carrots was only prevented to a slight extent by peat and sand. In boxes with slits in the walls, Fusarex had a favourable effect at the beginning of storage period, if the carrots were not damaged by maggots of Psila rosae. Towards the end of the storage period rotting was not prevented by Fusarex in any experimental group. The results are given in Table 1, p. 88. In experiment 1 in table 1, rotting was chiefly due to Botrytis sp. In experiments 2 and 4plenty of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) De Bary was also found. Each fungus formed plenty of mycelia and sclerotia on the skin of untreated carrots (fig. 1 and 2). If these fungi were found on carrots treated with Fusarex and Belvitan K they grew beneath the skin and rotted the carrots from within. In experiment 3, rotting was caused by Fusarium avenaceum (Fries) Sacc., Botrytis sp., and Stempylium radicinum (M. Dr. & E.) Neerg., the first-mentioned being the commonest of them. Fusarex did not seem to have much effect on Fusarium. As the cause of rotting, the other fungi found in this experiment were of slight importance. Especially towards the end of the storage period, the losz of weight was somewhat greater for untreated than for treated carrots. This was probably chiefly due to easier evaporation of water from diseased carrots as compared to sound ones. Storage with peat at first increased, later prevented the loss of weight. Evidently peat at first absorbed water from the carrots, but later, when it had become wet, it prevented evaporation. Experiments 1 and 2 show that under certain circumstances rotting is effectively prevented by Fusarex. It has an inhibiting effect at least on Botrytis and Sclerotinia, if treatment is conducted before the beginning of the rotting process. Belvitan K seems to have a similar quality. In experiment 3, which was conducted with fairly small experimental lots in open boxes, the effect of Fusarex was of short duration in sound and broken carrots, and in carrots damaged by maggots of Psila rosae it had no effect at all. It is possible that due to open boxes and small storage lots some of the effective ingredient volatilized from Fusarex. This opinion is confirmed by experiments conducted in England on stored potatoes (1, 2). It it also probable that the different result of experiment 3, as compared to experiments 1 and 2, is due to the different types of fungi found in this experiment. On the other hand, it is easy to understand that Fusarex cannot prevent the rotting of carrots damaged by maggots of Psila rosae. The spores of fungi can namely enter the passages dug by the maggots already during the growth period, and the infection occurs before storage. Some firms in Helsinki have experimented with Fusarex in carrot storage. Results have been favourable. The following amounts of carrots were treated with Fusarex in the storage sheds by the following firms: Helsingin kaupungin Elintarvikekeskus 128.000 kg., Kesko Oy 10.000 kg., Oy Tuotevälitys 5.000 kg. In these firms, carrots are usually placed in open bins, in 20—70 cm. thick layers. The temperature in the sheds varies from 2 to 6° C. 1—2 months after the beginning of storage the carrots usually begin to rot so badly that their storage must be interrupted. The progress of the disease can only be prevented to a slight extent by removing the diseased carrots. The firms have reported that losses by disease have been decidedly lower when carrots have been treated with Fusarex. If they were sound when put in storage, the losses caused by fungi were only 0—5 % even after 3—5 months’ storage period. Losses were, however, greater, if part of the carrots were infected, even if slightly, at the beginning of storage. Fusarex-treated carrots were sold to customers in Helsinki. So far they have not been found to be unhealthy or to have a more unpleasant taste than untreated carrots. The taste experiments conducted at Department of Plant Pathology also showed that Fusarex or Belvitan K did not have injurious effects on the taste of carrots.",

    "abstract": "Reporting on conceptions to date regarding the significance of organic matter in the soil, the author presents a biologico-dynamic view on plant production; soil fertility i. e. its ability to produce both qualitatively and quantitatively the best crops at a minimum of cost is primarily determined by its biological condition, varying in accordance with the composition and the succession phases of the biotic community (biocoenose) of the humus. This biocoenose of the humus has a twofold activity: the production of organic matter and its decomposition. If man ignores this perpetual circulation by harvesting his crop and by administering only mineral salts to the plants direct, the biocoenose loses its equilibrium and is destroyed. The result is the disappearance of top soil, erosion, and the degeneration of plants, animals and man. This can only be averted by providing the biocoenose of the humus with sufficient quantities of such organic matter that the biocoenose can use as source of carbohydrates and other nutrients. The quantity required varies in the different climates and conditions. A part of it is obtained as the waste of crop, primarily roots. According to Sauerlandt (38) and Salonen (37), the author states, if the objective is to replace annually with equal quantities of organic matter the amount lost from the biocoenose in the form of the crop, clover is the only plant cultivated in Finland that leaves an adequate amount of root stock in the soil. Cereals and particularly root vegetables and greens leave far too little of it, fruit trees and berry bushes less still. The deficit can be replenished by correctly prepared cattle manure containing enough straw. But in the neighbourhood of towns and villages, where mainly intense gardening is practised, the amounts of manure available are grossly inadequate. The best source of organic matter in such conditions is the refuse of population centres, containing mainly paper, food waste and ashes. Its composition makes this waste ideal nutrition for the fungi, actinomycetes and bacteria which play the main part in the humus. They require the carbohydrates offered to them in readily digestible form, as by the cellulose in paper. The population in towns and other centres of population in Finland totals 1,640,000, producing approx. 300 million kg dry waste annually. Approx. 1 million people live in areas furnished with sewage facilities. The N, P and K salts contained in wet and dry waste are alone very valuable; at the same time, mineral fertilisers were imported to Finland 1949 to the value of 2,110 million marks. At the moment dry waste from all Finnish towns is taken to dumps, but in Helsinki for instance no dumps will be available within a reasonable distance in 3 years, for which reason an incinerator has been planned. At their meeting of November 24, 1949. the Helsinki Horticultural Society decided to request the Municipal Administration to alter their resolution. At their annual meeting of March 20, 1950, the Association of Horticulturists adopted a resolution demanding the Goverment to initiate investigations and to supplement the items on disposal of refuse included in the Act on Public Health. After a review of the uses of dry waste in the different parts of the world, the author comes to the conclusion that the high wages paid in Finland do not permit the use of the laborious Indore Method and its variations. But a very simple and both technically and biologically successful method and equipment (Dano) has been invented in Denmark, and the author has studied it in some Danish and Swedish towns. A single slowly revolving drum mixes, reduces, granulates, sorts and empties the waste automatically onto a conveyor belt, untouched by hand, converting it in a few hours into an odourless, porous grey product, very easy and convenient to handle. While fresh this product develops a better and more even heat in nursery beds than horse manure. »Ripe», i.e. fermented in heaps, it is excellent manure and soil improvement matter, increasing the crops of all cultivated plants. If no buyers are found for the product, it can be used as clean soil filling to provide valuable plot land. Aerobic fungi and bacteria increase rapidly in the product, and while stored in heaps its own heat makes it self-pasteurising, and it is therefore absolutely hygienic. In Northern conditions it is obviously the most advantageous method of waste treatment, more so than controlled tipping, not to mention burning which is most expensive of all. Sewage or night soil can easily be combined with Dano compost, as is done e.g. at Karlskoga in Sweden, and in that case too the product is odourless and hygienic. The conclusions of the author are as follows To prevent the disappearance of humus top soil, to reduce the necessity for purchasing fertilisers, to lower the high cultivation costs occasioned by exceedingly high manure prices, and to improve the quality of cultivated products, the tendency should be to treat both dry and wet town and village waste so that it can be utilised in household and market gardens, in agriculture and for the improvement of waste soils. This can be done successfully, with technical and biological advantages employing the mechanical composting method, e.g. Dano convertor equipment.",

    "abstract": "To provide compensation for the economic losses incurred in the 1939—1944 wars, several laws were passed in Finland, including the Compensation Acts of 1940 and 1942, and the so-called Second Compensation Act of 1945. The article deals with the valuation of the benefits attached to agricultural real estate, primarily as regards the application of the Second Compensation Act. The benefits include a number of different rights of enjoyment and income-earning rights, and certain parts of property that cannot be included under any other heading in an agricultural estate. The benefits can be divided into two groups according to whether they should be valued separately and the obtained value added to the value of the agricultural estate, or whether the value of the benefits should be considered as included in the value of the agricultural land, in which case their absence must be allowed for as a reduction in the value of the agricultural estate. The first group should include e.g. sources of soil improvements essential to the farm’s own use, and the rights of encumbrance belonging to the farm, i.e. right of way, water rights or driving rights for cattle, as such rights must be considered indispensable to the continued running of the farm. The absence of the benefits reduces the value of the estate, and the reduction in value must be defined by calculating the cost of remedying the deficiency. Income-earning benefits must be valued on the basis of the average annual pure yield obtained. In the valuation of an area containing raw materials, of which the quantity is limited, the quantity of saleable material, unit price and probable time of sale must be considered. Whenever sales can be assumed to continue for 60 years, the present-day value of the benefit can be obtained, with no serious inaccuracy, by capitalising the annual pure yield in terms of its continuing for an unlimited time. In other cases the present-day value of the benefit must be calculated by allowing for its limited period of duration and by discounting the yield values to be obtained in this period in terms of the present moment. In valuation of the sales of gravel, sand, clay etc. sources, the quantity of saleable material only should be considered, and in the calculations the precentage of covering soil, stones, etc., must be deducted. In addition, the natural slope of the gravel must be taken into consideration, for it causes a considerable quantity of material to be left against the walls of a deep gravel or sand pit, material which cannot be included in the saleable material. In valueing areas suitable for housing, business or industrial plots, the real sale and purchase prices of similar areas must be taken as the basis, plus the extent of the area and the probable annual demand for plots. The value of a plot can be defined as the present-day value of a yield continuing for a limited time. If the area is very large its value can be computed by capitalising the average annual pure yield obtained from the sale of plots. The value of plot is greatly dependent on the potential use of the plots, and extensive areas in the neighbourhood of centres of population may have a speculative value higher than the possible estimate of the average value of all similar areas. In applying the Second Compensation Act it was also necessary to value plot areas in the neighbourhood of and within such centres of population as had been destroyed and which were designed to be re-built in an entirely new location which latter was also ceded as a result of the war. In such a case the old location in its entirety was assumed to be in the state it would have been in 1944 undestroyed, and in the new location only such small areas were valued as plot land as had been bought at plot price for the owner’s personal use. As regards the rest of the area, no special value was awarded the land as prospective plots.",

    "abstract": "These observations have been made with a view to examining the horticultural value of ten highbush blueberry varieties of American origin under Finnish conditions. The varieties are as follows; Atlantic, Burlington, Concord, Jersey, June, Pemberton, Rancocas, Rubel, Scammell and Stanley. The material originates from two nurseries in the United States. The bushes have been planted in spring 1947 as one-year-olds. They have yielded during the summers of 1948 and 1949. The observations are thus preliminary in character and are, indeed, insufficient for a final decision on the suitability of the different varieties to Finnish conditions. The results of the observations are presented in Tables 1—7 and in Graph. 1. The results presented in the tables concern the following subjects: the rate of growth, the number of yield-aged bushes, the amount of the yield, the earliness of ripening, the average weight of one berry, the decrease of the size of the berries harvested at the end of the yielding season, and the desert quality of the berries. When possible, comparisons have been made with the results obtained from American experiments. On the basis of the various observations the conclusion has been drawn that Rancocas. Pemberton, Stanley and June seem to be the most promising varieties for continued experiments under Finnish conditions. It has been established that several characters of some of the varieties tested deviate considerably from that observed earlier in the United States. Atlantic has proved to be one of the earliest varieties in Finland. In addition the size of the berries is smaller than in America. Pemberton is here not a late but a midseason variety. The variety Rancocas has produced berries considerably larger than under American conditions.",

    "abstract": "Am 6. Oktober 1945 verschied der Leiter der Tätigkeit des Finnischen Moorkulturvereins, Ökonomierat Dipl.-Ing. Evert August Malm, im Alter von 74 Jahren. Nach seiner eigentlichen Studienzeit hatte er das Landmesser-, das Agronom- und. las Kulturingenieurexamen bestanden. Nachdem er zwei Jahre als überzähliger Vermessungsingenieur tätig gewesen war, wurde er Konsulent des 1896 gegründeten Finnischen Moorkulturvereins und später daselbst Sekretär sowie 1919 Leiter der Tätigkeit des genannten Vereins; aus dieser Stellung trat er am 1. 9. 1945 in den Ruhestand. Somit hat er über 48 Jahre im Dienste des Moorkulturvereins gestanden. Die e Zeit umfasst mancherlei Planung, eifrige Arbeit zur Überwindung von Schwierigkeiten und Durchführung von Plänen, zugleich aber auch Freude und Zufriedenheit als die modernen Moorkulturmethoden in stets weiteren Kreisen bekannt werden. Eine der ersten und in ihren Ergebnissen beständigsten Arbeiten Malms ist seine 1003 unternommene Ermittlung des Flächeninhalts der finnischen Moore. Gleich in den Anfängen seiner Tätigkeit führte Malm Mooruntersuchungen aus, und er blieb bis zum Ende seines Lebens ein warmer Förderer und Ansporner dieser seiner Untersuchungstätigkeit. Insbesondere ist zu bemerken, dass Malm auch in seinen Mooruntersuchungen sehr weitsichtig war und stets betonte, dass alle Nutzungsmöglichkeiten der Moore gleichzeitig zu erforschen seien. Demgemäss war neben den Land- und Waldbaubedingungen der Moore gewiss auch herauszustellen, ob die Torfvorkommen entweder für Torfstreu- oder Brenntorfgewinnung nutzbar gemacht werden könnten. Eine andere Seite der Lebensarbeit Malms macht sein Anteil an der Pflanzenbau Versuchstätigkeit Finnlands aus. Auf sein und Professor Rindells Betreiben wurden in Finnland unter anderem drei Moorversuchsstationen gegründet; die Planung der an ihnen ausgeführten Versuche ist grossenteils die Arbeit Malms. Für sie opferte. Malm viel Zeit, daher haben die Versuche zu ausserordentlich gut auf die Praxis anwendbaren Ergebnissen geführt. Von diesen sind die Entwässerungs-, Meliorations-, Kalkungs- und Düngungsversuche, auf Grund deren heute den Moorbauern zu sicherem Ergebnis führende Anleitungen gegeben werden können, insbesondere zu erwähnen. Gemäss den Versuchsergebnissen empfahl Malm im allgemeinen starke Düngung, betonte aber immer besonders die Notwendigkeit gleichzeitig zuzuführender Kali und Phosphorsäuredüngung sowie die Wichtigkeit von Stickstoffdüngung in gewissen Fällen. Malm hat in vielen finnischen Gesellschaften und Vereinigungen eifrig gearbeitet, aber eine ganz hervorragende Bedeutung hat sein Wirken im Bereich der Vereinigung der Landwirtschaftsforscher der Nordischen Länder angenommen. Er war einer der finnischen Gründer dieser Vereinigung und gehörte in Finnland zu ihren zentralsten Persönlichkeiten. Er war 1927—1945 Sekretär der Finnischen Sektion dieser Vereinigung. Ökonomierat Malm hat zugunsten der Landwirtschaft Finnlands eine tiefe Furche gepflügt. Ausser seinen grossen Leistungen hat er uns die schönste Erinnerung an einen guten und feinfühligen sowie zugleich kritisch überlegenden Mann hinterlassen.",

Kun suomenkielinen termi korvaushinta ilmaisee rehujen arvon ainoastaan yksipuolisesti karjatalouden kannalta katsottuna, aiheuttaa sekaannusta verrattuna vastaaviin vieraskielisiin termeihin ja suomenkieliseen korvikearvo-termiin, olisi tarkoitukseen paremmin soveltuvaa termiä jalostusarvo käytettävä korvaushinnan asemesta. Ajatusyhteydestä riippuen voidaan käyttää myös jalostushintaa merkitsemään rehuista jalostamalla saatua taloudellista tulosta. Jalostusarvolaskelma olisi pyrittävä laatimaan siten, että tulos osoittaa kaikelle kotoiselle rehulle saadun jalostushinnan. Alempien tuotantokustannustensa perusteella olisi laidunrehun arvoksi ry:ä kohden laskettava puolet kotoisten rehujen keskimääräisestä jalostushinnasta. Muiden rehujen jalostushinta olisi laskettava ry-arvon, valkuaismäärän ja täyttävyyden perusteella. Karjatalouden ja kasvinviljelyksen kannattavuuskysymysten arvostelemiseen voidaan käyttää joko bruttojalostusarvoa tai nettojalostusarvoa, kuitenkin siten, että ainoastaan samoilla perusteilla laadittujen laskemien tuloksia verrataan toisiinsa. Kun bruttojalostusarvolaskelmaan ei sisälly ns. välillisiä kustannuksia, olisi laskelma suuremman yksinkertaisuutensa ja tulostensa luotettavuuden tähden soveltuvissa kohdin asetettava nettojalostusarvolaskelman edelle. Bruttojalostusarvoja ei voida käyttää rehujen arvioimiseen muiden kotieläinryhmien eikä eri viljelyskasvien tuotantokustannuslaskelmissa. Nettojalostusarvoja ei voida verrata samojen rehujen myyntihintaan ottamatta huomioon, että karjatalouden välilliset kustannukset, jotka sisältyvät nettojalostusarvolaskelman kustannuksiin, on suoritettava rehujen myyntihinnasta. Käytettäessä jalostusarvoja varastojen arvioimiseen ei korkokustannusta voida sisällyttää peruskustannukseen. Muiden kotieläinryhmien käyttämien rehujen hinnoittamiseen ja varastojen arvioimiseen voidaan käyttää ainoastaan rehujen keskimääräisiä, yleistä tasoa osoittavia jalostusarvoja. Nettojalostusarvolaskelmissa olisi rakennusten korko ja kuoletus vertailukelpoisten tulosten saavuttamiseksi laskettava joko käyttämällä annuiteettia tai laskettava korkokustannus puoleksi kunkin rakennuksen uudisarvon mukaisesta korkokustannuksesta. Jalostusarvolaskelmien suurimpana heikkoutena on pidettävä tulosten riippuvaisuutta käytettyjen rehujen laadusta sekä perusrehun (tai kotoisen rehun) määrästä verrattuna karjalle käytettyjen rehujen kokonaismäärään ja tilalla käytettävissä olevien rehujen määrään. Ratkaisevana tekijänä karjatalouden kannattavuutta arvosteltaessa on pidettävä käytettävissä olevista rehuista saatavaa kokonaishintaa. Vertailukelpoisten tulosten saavuttamiseksi olisi rehujen jalostusarvo laskettava muunnettua rehunviljelysalan hehtaaria kohden.",

Later topdressing allows adjustment of fertilizer level at a stage when it is easier to predict nitrogen supply from soil. The objectives were: to investigate whether topdressing can be applied after stem elongation and to assess effects on yield and quality in different oat varieties; and to study the variation in optimum N-rate and the possibility to predict and readjust it during the growing season. In 14 field experiments conducted in Sweden 2020–2022, the effect of split nitrogen application, with topdressing at growth stage (GS) 32, GS45, or GS55–61, on yield and quality in six different oat varieties was evaluated. Late topdressing increased grain protein concentration and decreased fat content, but variety was more important for target quality. Compared with a single early application, late topdressing did not affect yield significantly. Year and site influenced yield and quality, similarly for all varieties, but had an impact on the effect N-treatment had on protein. A multiple regression analysis showed that yield at OptN and N-uptake in unfertilized plots at GS31–47, can explain the variation in OptN and thus be used to estimate OptN. Topdressing as late as at GS45–61 increased the chances both of higher protein and more accurate prediction of OptN. Therefore, recommendations for late topdressing can be preferable if there is a target for high protein or if there are incentives to use crop sensors for late and accurate adjustments of N fertilization rates between and within fields. The recommendations should not be dependent on variety.",

    "abstract": "Most blackberry plants cultivated in Finland closely resemble the American species Rubus allegheniensis. Thirty nine such blackberry accessions in the University of Helsinki clone collection were studied by hybridization-based DNA fingerprinting and compared with some known cultivars of R. allegheniensis derivation. ‘lmperial’ appears to be identical to the old cultivar ‘Majestät’, but ‘Earliest of All’ differs considerably. In addition, 37 of the accessions analysed also have DNA fingerprints that appear to be completely identical to that of ‘Majestät’! The remaining two accessions, although identical to each other, exhibit one band not found in ‘Majestät’ that is probably caused by a somatic mutation.",

    "abstract": "A 2 × 4 factorial experiment was conducted with 80 growing-finishing pigs to evaluate effects of barley storage (stored barley harvested the previous year or freshly harvested barley) and supplemental vitamin E (0, 40, 80 or 160 mg/kg as all-rac-a-tocopheryl acetate) on pig performance and the storage stability and eating quality of frozen pork. Pigs were fed isoenergetic barley-soybean meal diets and vitamin E was rationed on the top of feed, a 2-d dose at a time. Stored and freshly harvested barley contained 33.5 and 31.2 mg/kg of vitamin E in the beginning and 33.0 and 38.7 mg/kg at the end of the study, respectively. Supplemental vitamin E had a quadratic effect on pig growth (P &lt; 0.05), the greatest weight gains being observed with 40 mg/kg of supplemental vitamin E in both barley diets. Vitamin E supplementation increased linearly serum (P &lt; 0.001) and quadratically back fat a-tocopherol (P &lt; 0.01). Plasma gluthathione peroxidase activity increased as pigs grew older (P &lt; 0.001), and at slaughter it decreased linearly with supplemental vitamin E (P &lt; 0.05). Dietary vitamin E supplementation did not affect the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) or the organoleptic quality of pork stored frozen (-18°C) for 16 weeks. The TBARS content of pork increased with time (0 to 8 d) thawed meat was displayed under fluorescent light at 8°C (P &lt; 0.001) which was detected as a poorer taste. In conclusion, supplemental dietary vitamin E above 40 mg/kg feed does not improve pig performance nor the storage stability or eating quality of frozen pork when freshly harvested or stored barley from good harvest conditions is fed to growing-finishing pigs.;",

Some occur constitutively, whereas others, which are emphasised in this review, are formed in response to pathogen attack and are considered as active reactions of plants. Induction of defence mechanisms can be observed in all plants regardless of their genetic background. Thus, this phenomenon can occur in cultivars with or without known genes for disease resistance. The general defence features of plants may contribute significantly to the overall disease resistance of plants and increasing evidence for the role of different defence molecules are being obtained from molecular studies. In this review, induction of defence mechanisms, especially phenylpropanoid metabolism and its role in the defence responses of cereals to pathogen attack is addressed. Also, induced resistance as a potential tool for disease control in cereals will be briefly discussed.;",

    "abstract": "Incubation and pot experiments were carried out on muddy fine sand and fine sand soils to determine the efficiency of dolomitic limestone and of industrial by-products, basic slag and peat ash, as liming agents. Calcitic limestone was used as reference material. In the incubation experiment 0, 0.6, 1.2 and 2,4 g calcitic limestone were applied to 390 g (muddy fine sand) or 360 g (fine sand) of air-dry soil. The amount of other liming agents added was 2.4 g. In the pot experiment the weights of soil were 3.9kg (muddy fine sand) and 3.6kg (fine sand) and 24 g of liming agent was applied. The turnip rape (Brassica campestris v. oleifera f.annua cv. Candle) was grown in two growing seasons and the crops were cut at the flowering stage. In both experiments the soils were sampled for analysis after four and sixteen months. The acidity of the soils was neutralized with the liming agents to the same extent in the pot and the incubation experiments. The increases in pH(CaCl2) obtained in the incubation experiment with 2.4 g liming agents were on the muddy fine sand and fine sand for calcitic limestone 2.0 and 1.4, for dolomitic limestone 1.5 and 1.1, for peat ash 0.3 and 0.2, for basic slag 0.8 and 0.6, respectively. At the end of the incubation 2.4 g of dolomitic limestone, peat ash and basic slag had increased the pH(CaCl2) of the soils to the same extent as 1.7 g, 0.4 g or 0.8 g of calcitic limestone, respectively. The proportion of non-exchangeable Ca at pH 7 of the amount added in 2.4 g liming agents was for calcitic limestone 14 and 23 %, for dolomitic limestone 42 and 52 %, for peat ash 27 and 51 %, and for basic slag 59 and 64 %, in the muddy fine sand and fine sand soils, respectively. Of the Mg added in dolomitic limestone, about 45 % was non-exchangeable, and in basig slag about 65 %. In the pot experiment about 13 % (average of the two soils) of the Ca applied in calcitic limestone was not found in turnip rape or as neutral 1 M ammonium acetate extractable from the soil. The corresponding value for dolomitic limestone was 41 %, for peat ash 45 % and for basic slag 65 %. The Mg applied in the liming agents but not found in turnip rape or in the soil amounted to 42 % for dolomitic limestone, 74 % for peat ash and 67 % for basic slag. The efficiency of basic slag as a liming agent will be over estimated if it is measured by the amount of acid neutralized or by the content of Ca and Mg (Ca + 1.65xMg) soluble in 1M HCI. The amount of Ca soluble in 1 M HCI, alone, may provide a better, though not good, measure of the neutralizing ability of basic slag.",

Lambs fed on pasture alone were compared with animals whose diet was supplemented with a barley-oats meal mixture (1:1), given at the level of 400—500 g/animal/day, or large-leaved turnip (Teutoburger), offered ad libitum. The age of the lambs at the beginning of the experiments averaged three months. The live-weight gain of the lambs receiving supplemental feeds did not differ significantly (P &lt; 0.1) from that of the lambs on only pasture feeding, though the supplements tended to have a favourable effect during the second part of the pasture period, or at the beginning of August. The slaughter criteria were better, however, for the lambs receiving supplements. Teutoburger turnip proved to be a good and palatable feed for lambs on pasture. Since it gives good yields even in northern Lapland, Teutoburger can be recommened for northerly regions where cereal crops do not ripen. The growth of lambs in Lapland seems to be decreased by mosquitoes and gnats.",

Sewage sludge was added in amounts of 0, 50 and 200 g of dry matter per pot of 5 litres =0, 20 and 80 tons per hectare respectively, given at the start of the experiment. Two soils, a loamy sand and a clay soil, were included in the experiment which has been running for 6 years (1973—78), with oats and barley every second year. The sewage sludge was anaerobically digested and had a relatively high content of heavy metals. Relative yields (grain + straw) for the experimental period were, as a mean of the two soil types, 100, 126 and 166 respectively for 0,50 and 200 g sewage sludge per pot. The uptake of N was 43.9 percent of added N in 50 g sludge and 32.6 percent of added N in 200 g sludge. For P the uptake was 23.9 and 18.5 percent respectively. The effect of sludge on the content of heavy metals in the yields was: Cd. Heavy effect. Heavier effect on the grain of oats than on the grain of barley. Cu. Distinct effect. Higher content in barley than in oats, and higher content in grain than in straw for both crops. Ni. Heavy effect, particularly in grain of oats. Higher content in grain of oats than in straw. For barley the content was slightly higher in straw than in grain. Zn. Distinct effect, particularly in the first two years. Highest increase in the straw. Pb and Hg. No effect. 14/71 included rates of up to 400 g dry matter per pot of anaerobically digested sewage sludge, two rates of lime, with crops of oats, barley, red clover and timothy. The experiment ran for two years (1971—72). Soil: Loam. The sludge had a positive effect on the total yield of all crops, but the highest rate had a negative effect on the grain of barley in the first year, and in the second year the hight rates caused retarded germination of all crops. The concentration of Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn was substantially higher in red clover than in timothy. With the addition of roughly the same amounts of heavy metals to unlimed loamy sand (H/73)and loam (14/71), oats obtained a higher concentration of Cd, Ni and Zn from the sludge with the highest content of these metals (H/73).",

The experiment was performed with 12 individually fed animals, eight of which were Friesians and four Finnish Ayrshires, and the average age of the animals at the beginning of the experiment was about 3.5 months. After a standardization period of two weeks, the animals were divided into two groups with similar distributions by daily gain, feed utilization, liveweight and age. During the following transition period of one week the feeding of the animals was changed to the experimental diets of the 24-week test period. The feeding was based on NaOH-treated barley straw and a mixture of barley, oats and molassed beet pulp, and planned for a daily gain of 1000 grams/animal. During the standardization period the animals received 2.9 % untreated urea in the concentrate, and soybean meal was also used to bring the feeding into agreement with the standards chosen. During the test period the animals received untreated or treated urea and their contributed about 35—40 % of their DCP requirements. There were no significant differences between the groups in daily gain, feed utilization or slaughter results. Nor did the two groups show any significant differences in plasma urea, albumin and total proteins. The plasma concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine amino transferase and creatinine did not differ significantly between the groups.",

The coefficients of simple and partial correlations between the contents of total magnesium or potassium or the ratios of K/Mg, Ca/Mg, Ca + Mg/K + Na in clover or timothy, the clover content of mixed ley, and the exchangeable cations or their ratios in soil were calculated separately for 1st year, 2nd year, and 3rd year or older leys.

Clover and timothy in mixed ley possibly compete with each other for cations. Cation ratios and the cation content of timothy seemed to be independent of the clover content of the mixed ley, the properties of clover in 2nd year and older leys were likewise not dependent on it. Variations up to 43 % in the magnesium and potassium contents and the cation ratios of clover in first year leys were explained by vatiations in their clover content, and when the exchangeable cations of soil were also taken into account, from 1 to 76 % of this variation could be explained.",

Sclerotia formed of mycelia treated with TCNB as well as with PCNB substances developed numerous sporophores which were not fertile however. The effect of both PCNB and TCNB on the mycelium of S. trifoliorum proved only restricting on the growth. It did not destroy the mycelia. The activity of the substances is dependent on the temperature and the higher effectivity of TCNB is based on its greater degree of vaporization (Tables 2—3, Figs. 2, 4 and 9).

The carcasses were evaluated, and their right half was cut. In order to estimate the between-sire variance and the heritability values, analyses of variance were performed. The between-sire variances were statistically significant for live weights and carcass weights and thus also for the weights of carcass half. The between-sire variance for results in kilograms was generally statistically significant, but for proportions in per cent the values were significant only in a few instances. The differences between sires were statistically highly significant for the relative proportions of fore and hind parts, which presumably is due to the sires being of different body conformation. The between-sire variance with regard to the amount of meat in kilogram is statistically significant for almost all parts of the carcass, but – except for the round – the differences with regard to meatiness percentage are slight. The amounts of meat obtained from different parts of the carcass, expressed as proportions of the total amount of meat, varies statistically significantly in most cases, which also points to the differences in body conformation of the animals. The area of the musculus longissimus dorsi was neither correlated with the weight of the carcass nor with the meatiness percentage. There was no difference between the sires with regard to the carcass grading except the round and shoulder. The grades for meatiness gave no clue to the meat percentage of the carcass or to the carcass weight or to the actual amount of meat, although earlier studies have shown grades of meatiness to follow the two latter characteristics. It may be pointed out that the present study is a preliminary one and will be completed with further trials.",

Ennen kaikkea ihmistyövoiman tarve pinta-alayksikköä kohti on pieni. Kääntäen voidaan sanoa, että peltoalan tarve yhtä työntekijää kohti on lammastaloudessa olosuhteisiimme verrattuna hyvin suuri. Koska ihmistyövoimaa on ollut maatiloilla runsaasti peltoalaan verrattuna, työvoimaa intensiivisesti käyttävä tuotannonhaara on vahvistunut tai säilyttänyt asemansa. Lypsykarjatalous on ollut työvoimaa runsaasti käyttävänä tuotannonhaarana ylivoimainen lammastalouteen verrattuna. Lammastalouden supistumiseen on myötävaikuttanut lisäksi luonnonlaidunten käyttömahdollisuuden huomattava vaikeutuminen (Lammastoimikunnan mietintö). Työvoiman siirtyminen pois maatiloilta ja työntekijäin vanheneminen vähentävät jatkuvasti maatalouden työvoimakapasiteettiä. Maatiloilla oleva työvoima hakee nyt ja tulevaisuudessa vielä enemmän tuotantomuotoja ja tuotannonhaaroja, jotka eivät sido työntekijää niin kiinteästi kuin lypsykarjatalous. Tällöin tulevat kysymykseen myös työtä ekstensiivisesti käyttävät tuotannonhaarat kuten lammastalous ja naudanlihan tuottaminen. Lammastalouden edellytykset kilpailla maidon ja naudanlihan tuottamisen kanssa ovat parantuneet myös siksi, että lampaanlihan hinta on kohonnut nopeammin kuin maidon ja naudanlihan hinta. Vuonna 1952 sai tuottaja lampaanlihasta 8.6 kertaa korkeamman hinnan kuin 4 %:sta maidosta. Vuonna 1967 oli hintojen suhde 10.3. Lampaanlihan tuottajahinta oli vuonna 1952 keskimäärin 13 % korkeampi kuin naudanlihan. Vuonna 1967 ero oli 19 % lampaanlihan hyväksi. Lampaan ruokinnan ja hoidon tekniikkaa on kehitetty huomattavasti viime vuosina mm. Norjassa, Ruotsissa ja Suomessa. Huomiota on kiinnitetty erityisesti suurten katraitten laidun- ja sisäruokinnan järjestelyyn, hoitotyön rationalisointiin ja terveyden hoitoon. Suuret katraat ovat ilmeisesti entistä kilpailukykyisempiä. Tätä osoittaa mm. Ruotsin lammasluvun lisäys noin 2 kertaiseksi viimeisen 8 vuoden aikana. Lampaiden lisäys on tapahtunut lähinnä suurehkoja katraita lisäämällä. Esitetyt karkean rehun jalostusarvolaskelmat osoittavat, että lammas maksaa nykyisten hintasuhteitten vallitessa keskimäärin alhaisemman korvaushinnan karkeista rehuista kuin keskitasoa oleva lypsylehmä tai teuraaksi kasvatettava nuori (alle 1-vuotias) nauta. Sen sijaan lammas näyttää pystyvän kilpailemaan keskitasoa heikomman lypsylehmän kanssa edellyttäen, että tavoitteena on saada jalostetuksi karkeat rehut markkinakelpoisiksi tuotteiksi. Lammas ja 1.5—2 vuotias lihanauta maksavat suoritettujen laskelmien mukaan suunnilleen saman suuruisen korvaushinnan karkeista rehuista. Tässä tutkimuksessa esitetyt laskelmat perustuvat sekä lammastalouden että naudanlihan osalta pieneen tutkimusaineistoon. Kun laskelmien perusaineistoon sisältyy huomattava hajonta, muodostuvat tulokset epävarmoiksi. Tarvittaisiin lisätutkimuksia sekä lammastalouden että naudanlihan tuotannon alalta. Erityisen mielenkiintoisia olisivat käytännön viljelmiltä saatavat sekä lammas- että lihakarjatalouden kannattavuutta koskevat tutkimukset.",

Von den für die Versuche gebrauchten Setzzwiebeln, die gewöhnliche Handelsware waren, waren fast 30 % von falschem Mehltau befallen. Die aus ihnen entwickelten Pflanzen verdarben im allgemeinen, ohne einen Zwiebelertrag hervorzubringen. Aus zwar vom falschen Mehltau befallenen, aber vor dem Auspflanzen wärmebehandelten Zwiebeln wuchsen dagegen ganz gesunde, lebenskräftige Pflanzen auf. Schon eine 3stündige Behandlung in trockener Temperatur von + 40°C reinigten die Setzzwiebeln vom falschen Mehltau, aber selbst eine 16mal so lang andauernde Behandlung (48 st) beschädigte sie nicht. Auch eine lstündige Behandlung im Wasser von +40°C vernichtete den falschen Mehltau, aber die Zwiebeln vertrugen unbeschädigt eine wenigstens 3mal so lange (3 st) Behandlungszeit. Dagegen erwies sich eine Behandlungszeit von ½ st als zu kurz (Tabelle 1—3). Die Trockenbehandlung übte ausserdem einen das Wachstum der Zwiebel unmittelbar steigernden Einfluss aus. Dadurch vergrösserte sich insbesondere bei lang andauernden (24 und 48 st) Behandlungen der Ertrag. Dagegen war bei Nassbehandlung ein unmittelbarer Einfluss auf das Wachstum der Zwiebel nicht festzustellen (Tabelle 7). Die Behandlung der Zwiebel (1 st) in 1 % Formalinlösung war dagegen ohne Wirkung gegen den falschen Mehltau; auf das Wachstum der Zwiebel wirkte sie beeinträchtigend ein (Tabelle 1 und 6). Der falsche Mehltau, der Anfang August (1949) an den Blättern erschien, befiel über 60 % der Zwiebelblätter (Tabelle 4), sie stark beschädigend, aber seine ertragvermindernde Wirkung blieb infolge des späten Zeitpunktes der Infektion doch verhältnismässig gering. Im Jahre 1948 ist im Sommer kein falscher Mehltau aufgetreten. Durch emulgierendes Weissöl hafteten die Fungiziden gut an den Pflanzen, wodurch sie die Pflanzen wirksam gegen den falschen. Mehltau schützten. Schwefelkalk + 2 % Weissölemulsion war ganz besonders effektiv; Kupferkalk 2 : 1.5 : 100 + 2 % Weissölemulsion war in der Wirkung etwas weniger gut (Tabelle 4). Perenox + Kiinnite haftete dagegen verhältnismässig schlecht an den Zwiebelblättern. Die Spritzmittel beschädigten die Zwiebelblätter besonders stark. Die mit reinem Weissöl bespritzten Pflanzen waren am schwersten beschädigt. Sehr gross waren auch die durch Schwefelkalk + Weissölemulsion verursachten Schäden. Dagegen beeinträchtigten Kupferkalk + Weissölemulsion und besonders Perenox + Kiinnite die Zwiebelblätter bedeutend weniger (Tabelle 5). Das Bespritzen mit Schwefelkalk + Weissölemulsion, das die Zwiebelblätter beschädigte, verminderte stark den Ertrag. Auch Kupferkalk + Weissölemulsion-Spritzung bewirkte eine erheblichen und Perenox + Kiinnite-Spritzung einen geringen Minderertrag (Tabelle 6 und 8).",

    "abstract": "This paper is based partly on the storing1 experiments carried out by the Department of Plan Pathology in 1931—1938, partly on the circulars sent to farmers by the Dept, in 1938, partly on earliee investigations. According to them the damage of stored potato on account of fungous diseases in Fin land is estimated at about 10 per cent of the total weight. The most serious potato disease during the storing time in Finland is the potato blight (Phytophthora infestans). About 70—90 per cent of sick, stored potato will have this disease as primary cause of rotting. The rest, 10—30 per cent, becomes decayed by bacterial diseases. The Fusarium-fungi on the contrary, isolated from stored potato, occur principally as saprophytes. Of that nature an Fusarium solani (MART.) APP. & WR., Fusarium sambucinum FUCH., Fusarium merismoides CORD/ and Fusarium avenaceuni (FRIES) SACC. Only the Fusarium coeruleum (LIBB.) SACC. is established as a parasitic fungus in a few cases, having no noticeable importance in the country. Likewise a number of saprophytic Cylindrocarpon-species (C. Ehrenbergi WR., C. Magnusianun WR., C. olidum WR. and C. radicicola WR.) occur on stored potato tubers. All the potato storing trials in Finland indicate that the keeping qualities of the potato varieties most susceptile to blight are quite insatisfactory. Therefore, the potato blight control which can be realized suitably by cultivation of the best resistant varieties is one of the most effective ways to prevent storing losses. The chemical preserving substances (Conservos and Karsan, p. 95) have not had any noticeable effect on the injurious storage diseases, blight and bacterial rot. Only the occurrence and development of some epiphytical fungi has been prevented by the use of those chemicals. 1 The potato in Finland is generally stored in root cellars and in pits.",

    "abstract": "The root systems of all crop plants are partly situated in subsoil, but under the conditions prevailing in Finland, the bulk of roots are in the ploughed layer. Is it then possible for plants to take water and nutrients from the subsoil? Investigations have been conducted in order to find out the significance of subsoil as the environment of roots, but experiments have been carried out either as pot tests, or in subsoil after removing the surface soil above it. It is evident that if the subsoil is no longer in its natural condition underneath the ploughed layer, considerable changes occur in it, at least in its physical properties. It would, however, be most interesting to find out what is the significance of the subsoil as such, in its natural condition, to plants. In order to illustrate this problem, a test method was developed, according to which it is possible to grow plants (oats) in ordinary undisturbed soil by means of subsoil only. Seeds were sown in glass tubes and the plants grew through these without having any contact with the ploughed layer (Fig. 1). The tubes were filled with quarts sand, free of all nutrients. Roots could not spread in the soil until after penetrating through the tube. It was observed that they did not begin to grow upwards after penetrating into the soil. Control plants were grown in usual manner beside the test plants. Yields per plant obtained from plants grown in this manner are given in centigrammes in Table 2. It is seen that it is possible for plants to grow by means of subsoil only. Individual plants of oats developed normally, they even yielded some grain, but remained very small in size. Thus subsoil can supply plants with all necessary nutrients, though their amounts are very small. Great natural variation of individual plants resulted in high standart errors for various treatments, but mean differences between various treatments were also so great as to make the differences statistically significant. A survey of the values of t in Table 2 shows that mean differences were significant between plants receiving nitrogen and those grown without nitrogen. From this it is possible to draw the conclusion that nitrogen is the nutrient the subsoil most of all lacks.",

    "abstract": "The main part of grasslands in Finland are leys which are maintained 2 to 4 years. This is the rule, especially with regard to grasslands for hay, and during the last few years there has been a tendency to use pastures in a similar way. For these reasons it is necessary to sow about 300 000 hectares of new grasslands per year in the country. In Finland drought is very common in spring and summer, and it often delays or prevents the germination of seeds and hampers the development of small seedlings. Failures at the establishment of new leys are mostly due to drought. In order to establish succesful leys, the development of the seedlings of ley plants, above all the development of their underground parts, roots, must be known. And the most important thing is to know the very first development of the plants. In order to throw some light upon these problems, some observations were made concerning the very first development of the most important ley plants. In order to obtain suitable material for observations, various grasses and clovers were sown on the University farm, Viikki, in a suburb of Helsinki, in the spring of 1950. All plants employed at the test were sown separately, as stands of single crops. There were plots with nurse crop (barley Tammi) as usual, as well as plots without any nurse crop. During the summer 1950 regular observations were made on the development of the aboveground and especially the underground parts of the different plants. For the plants growing without any nurse crop, the dates of observation were towards the end of June, at the beginning and the end of July, towards the middle of August and towards the middle of September. For plants growing under a nurse crop, observations were not made until after the harvesting of the nurse crop (Aug. 11th), viz. towards the middle of August and towards the middle of September. The technique employed at the observation of the underground parts was that developed by the writer of this paper and employed by him in an earlier investigation (5). Main results of the investigation. Plants growing without nurse crop. The development of the aboveground parts is most clearly shown by yields (as oven-dry material) obtained at harvesting, September 5-th. They were: red clover 359 g. per m2, alsike clover 288 » white clover 157 » timothy grass 35 » cocksfoot 151 » meadow fescue 56 » red fescue 32 » Kentucky bluegrass 0 » Species of clover and cocksfoot produced yields corresponding to a fair yield of hay, but the others produced very little, and Kentucky bluegrass nothing whatever to be harvested. As to the underground parts, roots, the following facts can be stated: All species of clover were similar with regard to the development of the roots. The roots of red clover developed most quickly. Already by the beginning of July the depth of the roots was 35 cm. for red clover, 25 cm. for alsike clover, and 15 cm. for white clover. Even after that the depth of the roots increased rapidly. By the middle of September the maximum depth of roots was 105 cm. for red clover, 95 cm. for alsike clover, and 105 cm. for white clover. Thus the roots of all the investigated species of clover reached a considerable depth already during the first growing season. The development of timothy grass was very slow at the beginning. By the beginning of July the roots had only reached a depth of 6 to 7 cm. And even after that the development of the roots was continuously slow, e.g. the number of roots increased slowly. By the middle of September the roots had reached a depth of 18 cm. With cocksfoot and meadow fescue, the development of the roots was similar. In a short time the roots of both plants reached a depth of about 10 cm. Already in July the number of roots was considerable, but they mostly grew laterally, so that the increase in depth was slight. By the middle of September the maximum depth of the roots was 23 cm. for cocksfoot and 18 cm. for meadow fescue. With red fescue and Kentucky bluegrass, the root development was also similar. Of all the investigated plants, their root development proved the most slow. As late as the end of July the maximum depth of the roots was only about 10 cm. By the middle of September the maximum root depth was 20 cm. for red fescue and 15 cm. for bluegrass. Plants grown under a nurse crop. On August 11th when the nurse crop was harvested, the aboveground parts of all investigated plants were very little developed. The seedlings evidently suffered badly from drought, whereas the plants growing without a nurse crop did not seem to suffer from it. Some rains occurred at the end of August, but even after the rainfall the seedlings developing under a nurse crop recovered very slowly. At the beginning of September there was nothing to be harvested on the whole area. The underground parts were also very little developed by the middle of August. Only clovers had reached the maximum root depth of over 10 cm., with cocksfoot and meadow fescue it was about 10 cm., with timothy grass, red fescue, and bluegrass it was considerably less than 10 cm. By the middle of September red clover had reached a depth of 30 cm., alsike clover 25 cm., and white clover 20 cm. Timothy grass only reached a depth of 10 cm., cocksfoot 11 cm., meadow fescue 12 cm., red fescue 10 cm., and bluegrass only 8 cm. With grasses growing under a nurse crop, primary roots retained a good condition much longer than with grasses growing without any nurse crop. The most interesting thing about these observations is the extremely harmful influence exerted on all ley plant seedlings by the nurse crop.",

    "abstract": "The relation between dry period milk yield among Finnish Ayrshire cattle has been studied in this investigation. The question has been handled particularly from the standpoint of breeding selection in weighing whether the length of the preceding dry period is to be taken into consideration in breeding selection and how exactly the length of the dry period due to genotype characteristic to each cow can be determined. The calculations made have given the following results: I. The length of the preceding dry period has comparatively small effect on the milk yield of the next lactation. The milk yield does in fact increase somewhat as the dry period lengthens up to sixty days (Figure 1) but this effect is so slight that it has no significance in breeding selection. 11. The determination of the length of the dry period characteristic to each cow is made difficult by the fact that its length is dependent not only upon the cow’s genotype but also to a very great extent upon non-genetic factors. The most important of these are; I. Feeding and care, 2. Length of calving interval, and 3. Number of previous lactations. 1. The quality and quantity of the feeding as well as the care of the cows has an apparently greater effect on the length of the dry period. In breeding selection it is especially confusing because it is very difficult to make even an approximate estimate of the effect of the different feeding and care on different farms on the length of the dry period, and it cannot be levelled by using mean correction factors or other levelling methods. This touches also the different feeding during the several seasons. One of the practical measures of cattle raising which brings about variation in the length of the dry period is that cows of great persistency are forced into dry period at the latest four to six weeks previous to the next calving. This variation is relatively small, however, compared to that arising from other non-genetic causes. 2. The length of the dry period is dependent upon the calving interval in that, as the calving interval increases the dry period increases also, and vice versa (r = +0.30±0.02, Table and Figure 3). In order to level the length of the dry period to correspond to the 365 day long calving interval, the mean correction factors have been calculated in this investigation (Table 4). 3. There is correlation between the number of previous lactations and dry period in so far that the first dry period is on an average 15 days shorter than the later dry periods. The abovementioned and many other non-genetic factors cause so much variation in the length of dry period that it for the great part conceals the variation due to different genotypes. Thus the greatest correlation coefficient between dam’s and daughter’s dry period is only +0.24±0.04 (Table 6). In this case the shortest available dry period chosen from among the dry periods whose corresponding calving interval has been 450 days at the most has been used as the dry period of a single cow. Such a method for the elimination of variation caused in the length of the dry period by the calving interval has proved to be at least as good as the application of mean correction factors, for from the dry periods levelled by correction factors a correlation coefficient between dam and daughter has been obtained amounting to + 0.23±0.03. On the other hand it is, however, to be noted that the effect of both the correction methods mentioned above is very small for the corresponding correlation coefficients computed from uncorrected dry period is +0.21±0.04. In spite of the low values the correlation coefficients presented are on about the same level as those obtained from the Ayrshire cows’ lactation milk yields between dam and daughter. As to the measure indicating the shape of the lactation curve, the so-called five months’ comparative milk yield, which is in use in Finland, it is considerably much less dependable. In the material at our disposal there is hardly any correlation (r = +0.08±0.04) between the five months’ comparative milk yields of dam and daughter. The dry period also expresses the most important and apparently the most varying part of the shape of the lactation curve, which is proved e. g. by the fact that in our feeding conditions the extent of the lactation milk yield depends to a considerable extent on the length of the dry period (r = —0.40±0.02, Table 5). As in addition the dry period is such a simple measure that all cattle-owners know how to apply it in breeding selection, it can well maintain its position among the measures indicating the shape of lactation curve.",

    "abstract": "An attempt has been made in the present investigation to elucidate the influence of growing legumes upon the microbial population and upon its activities in the soil. Annual legumes, pea and vetch were compared with oats, and red clover with timothy. At the beginning and at the end of the summer the number of bacteria, calculated through various culture media, appeared to be greater in the rhizosphere of the pea plants than under the vetch or oat plants. The rhizosphere flora of the young pea plants showed a capacity for more active nitrogen fixation than that of the young vetch or oat plants, but later the superiority of the pea plants disappeared. A higher rate of nitrification under and for some time after the legume crops compared with the corresponding non-legume crops was noted. Nitrification of added ammonium sulfate did not occur more actively under the legumes, due either to the lack of a stimulation of the nitrifying flora, or to the higher acidity in the legume soils. Compared with the non-legumes, the legumes could not be found to stimulate carbon dioxide production from the soil in any other way than through their more easily decomposable residues. Within the bounds of this investigation no special effect of legumes upon the soil flora could be established that cannot be explained on the basis of their nitrogen economy, either their utilizing soil nitrogen to a smaller degree than non-legumes, or due to composition of their roots and stubble. Under the field conditions, however, several other factors not demonstrable from this material may exist.",

    "abstract": "The writer describes at first the botanical qualities of the wintercress, Barbaraea arcuata (Opitz) Rchb. as well as its noxiousness and utility to the agriculture. The spreading of the wintercress in Finland is exposed in the table 1. It shows that the frequency of its spreading in the different parts of the country is relatively low and equal. Locally there is though exceedingly great differences in the frequency of its appearence. During the years 1945—1947 the writer was making tests in Tuusula to effect the control of wintercress. The results of these tests are exposed in the tables 2, 3 and 4, and are showing, that the possibilities of wintercress control by using calcium cyanamide and hormone products are limited, but not quite unimportant. The hormone products used both as sprays and as dusts are efficient in preventing the qrowth of wintercress on the grasslands. Their use is though to be taken into consideration so far it is economically profitable and only on cloverless meadows, because clover do not endure hormone application. The effect of calcium cyanamide (100—150 kg/ha) on wintercress is insufficient. Though it prevents partly the development of the plantvines and reduces the seeding. The best results were obtained by using of a very early distributing time the wintercress being at the rosette stage. The use of greater amounts of calcium cyanamide (200—250 kg/ha) with greater effect on the wintercress might appropriate on old weedless grasslands, where the vegetation for the most part consists of timothy or other fieldgrasses.",

    "abstract": "The chief purpose of the experiments has been to find out the thiamin content of the different parts of wheat grain. Special attention has been paid to the relation of the thiamin and fat content in germ, in the outer bran tissues, and in flours of different grades. On comparing the yeast fermentation method and thiochrome method with each other the former gave 45 to 85 per cent higher values for thiamin than the latter. The results presented in this paper were obtained by using the thiochrome method. All thiamin, as well as crude fat, ash, and fiber contents are given on dry basis. 70 to 80 per cent of the thiamin contained in wheat is concentrated in the germ end of the kernel. In analysis there were obtained the following contents for the germ preparations separated in a special way; ash 5.6 &amp; 5.7 %; thiamin 35.1 &amp; 35.0 μg/g; fat 18.8 &amp; 15.8 % (the corresponding figures of whole kernel; 1.8 &amp; 2.0 %; 3.9 &amp; 3.5 μg/g; and 2.0 &amp; 2.0 %). The thiamin content of the germ preparation was accordingly 9 to 10 times and the fat content 8 to 10 times greater than that on whole kernel so that the relation of the thiamin and fat contents in the germ preparation was about the same as in whole kernel. The content of ash, on the contrary, vas comparatively much lower in germ. The thiamin content of the outer bran tissues of wheat is very low. A small quantity of bran containing thiamin only about a quarter (0.9 μg/g) of the amount contained in whole kernel (3.8 μg/g) was separated with a scouring apparatus of simple construction. It was further possible to separate material about 7 per cent of the weight of grain from its surface without more than 7 per cent decrease in the thiamin content; while the decrease in the fiber content was greater by far (about 40 per cent). The relation crude fat/thiamin is greater in bran tissues than in whole kernel. Analytical data are given of milling products and a series of flours of a commercial mill which was obtained by mixing mill streams in an order according to the ascending ash content. The possibility to control the amount of thiamin in commercial flour and its physiological value on the ground of the ash and fat contents is discussed. On the ground of the fat analysis it is to some extent possible to decide whether the vitamin or mineral substances found in flour has come into it »in a natural way» i.e. as a result of a high rate of extraction, or if a remarkable part of the nutrient in question has been added into it.",

    "abstract": "The development of the horses’ pulling power by breeding is disturbed by many factors which render it difficult to substantiate. At the time of registration for, the pedigreebook, the pulling test done by the dynamometer does not present a right picture of every stallions pulling power, as all are not sufficiently well trained for the test. Also the experience of pulling is often slight owing to the lack of work, eventhough the war has improved the situation in this respect. Furthermore faults in caring for and feeding the horse may hinder producing the horses’ full pulling propensity. Besides these different circumstances may effect the results of test performed at various times of the year. Especially the average level of the results in the spring show is erronecously high owing to the test car s tyres slipping on account of the wet ground. The affect of all the above-mentioned inaccuracies can be lessened by using the experimental technique, and the great rise in the experimental results after 1940 is foremost to be put to the merit of the stallions being better accustomed to work, showing that the development has quickly led to even more dependable results. But even if all these experimental faults in technique could be removed the pulling ability of the stallion in the pulling test does still not show its tractive ability because it is the combined results of power and character. The dividing of horses into stepgrades shows that the characteristically deficient horses weed out together with the inexperienced already in the exercise- or walking route or in the first steps. This is confirmed by the manner of weeding out, because horses belonging to the lower stepgrades are not able to start their pull at all; when insted strenght fails those which have reached the higher steps while on the traction stretch with their load. In investigating the inherited pulling power one has, therefore, taken into account from each age group only the stallions who have pulled at least 35 % of their liveweight, as in this way one has been able to weed ont the lower stepgrades’ characteristiccally deficient and untrained horses. The correlation obtained from sires and sons by this procedure is +0.29 ±O.lO. Now the mares’ different pulling reliability was not at all taken into account. In order that the mares dissimilar influence on results could be made the lowest possible, the correlation has also been calculated only from material comprising sons whose dams’ pulling reliability has been valued at 6 points. The correlation then obtained is +0.33±0.11. The final result is harmfully effected by the fact that the correlation is nearest dependent on the stallions who have plenty of offspring. Owing to this, the results have been calculated so that the average of each son has been reckoned and that the correlation between the sires’ and sons’ average. Thus one obtains in the whole material of the sires’ and sons’ correlation +0.37 ±0.15, and from the material comprising sons of 6 point dames +0.46 ±0.15. The sons have been at an average 0.32 steps better than their sires, which foremost is due to them being better trained for the pull. In the pulling results of the sons one can however also notice the influence from the dams, because the sons of 6 point dams have at an average been 0.78 steps better than their sires, and the sons of 5 point dams exactly equal with their sires, and the sons of 0-4 point dams 0.15 steps poorer than their sires. The comparison of the average of all the stallions shows that the sons of the best stallions have most obviously exceeded the midlevel and from the point of view of development of pulling power the best results have been gained when more powerful stallions have been used in breeding with dams most reliable in pulling. In order to gain even better results in the development of horses’ pulling power, the excercising for test should be made even more effective than previously. To lessen the technical test faults the spring shows should be given up and even in summer when the ground is wet, the slipping of car tyres should be prevented by snow-chains. The testing of dams’ pulling power should be developed similarly to that of the stallions. The pedigree book demands should follow the rapid progress which has been noticed in recent years in the pulling tests thanks to better training.",

    "abstract": "In the beginning of the 19th century Finland may have been able to meet its own demand for seeds as rye, barley, oats, meadow foxtail etc. were exported even at that time. The production of seeds was not, however, capable of following the rapid development of plant production for which reason the demand for imported seeds increased during the latter part of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century. Attempts were made to augment the production of seeds in the 1910’s and about 1920. At this time a great interest in seed cultivation was observable. After the first World War it was, however, checked by the supply of cheaper foreign seeds. In the 1920’s and the 1930’s the amount of imports grew on the part of the majority of seed kinds (Table 1). During the present decade our dependence on foreign seeds has constantly increased (Table 2). From the plant production standpoint the development in this direction is exceedingly deplorable as the imported seeds, owing to their origin, seldom meet the requirements set upon the domestic ones. Finland is able to produce most of the different kinds of seeds and also to export them which fact has been proved by the considerable export of meadow foxtail and timothy seed in the 1940’s (Table 3). For this reason serious attention must be paid to the seed problem when planning the future plant production, and the cultivation of seeds must be developed as far as possible to meet the demand of our own plant production.",

    "abstract": "The object of the investigation described was to determine how added salts reduce the pH of the soil and how soon the latter rises when the soil is irrigated and percolated by water. The experiment was performed in paraffined cardboard containers with holes in their bottoms to let the water out. The 5 different soil types used appear in Table 1. A same volume, 325 ml, of all the different soils was used, and the weight in grammes as Well the volume weight and the loss of ignition are shown in Table 1. 26.4 mg ekv. of each kind of salt were used per pot = 81.3 mg ekv./l of soil. The salts used also appear in Table 1. From time to time the pots were watered with distilled water and in the intervals were left to dry more or less, as happens in nature. The soil area of the pots being 50 cm2, 100 ml water used in irrigation corresponds to 20 mm rain. The amount of water used at different times as well as the outflow of water are given in Table 2, which also shows the pH observed at different periods. In order to give a clear view of the proceedings graphic representations of the chief results are given in Figs. 1—5, in which the outflow of water is marked on the abscissa and the pH values on the ordinate. The results show that the addition of salts (with the exception of CaC03) has initially clearly reduced the pH of the test soils, but on irrigation the percolating water has washed away the released H-ion and the pH of the soil rises. This rise appears most swiftly and clearly when KCl is used. It can be stated that it will eventually have raised the pH definitely above that of the untreated soil. An addition of CaCl2 also causes the pH to rise but more slowly and leaves it at about the same level as the pH of the untreated soil. In general an outflow of 100 mm water seems already sufficient to wash away from the soil the H-ion released by the addition of salts. As the amount of water which in Finland yearly percolates the soil, may be estimated to average 200 mm of rain, it may be concluded that neutral salts cannot cause a permanent increase in the acidity of soil but may on the contrary cause a slight decrease. I able 3 shows the amount of exchangeable K and Ca found in the soil on the end of the experiment. The added K has effected a considerable washing away of Ca, and similarly the added Ca has to some extent caused the K to be washed away. The greater part of the added K and Ca (omitting the CaCO2) has been washed away from the soil. Table 4 shows the hygroscopic moisture of the soil on the end of the experiment. It has been only slightly influenced by the added salts.",

    "abstract": "In the research carried out observations have been made as to the effect of plant hormone products upon weeds and several cultured crops. In the tests have been used hormone dusts Agroxone and Bayer 2,4 D, also hormone sprays Bayer 2,4 D, Hormotox II, 2—4 Dow Weed Killer and Weedone. The tests or field experiments have been made in Tuusula, 40 km from Helsinki, on the school farm of Järvenpää and also on the farm of Kyrölä. Part of tests was placed in cereal crop cultures, the other parts on potato and beet crops, grasslands, stubble fields, flax cultures, gardens, small woods and free places. The effect of the above named hormone products was different. The most sensitive weeds in the trials were Brassica campestris, Raphanus raphanistrum and Equisetum arvense. Medium sensitive were a great number of weeds as Erysimum cheiranthoides, Thlaspi arvense, Capsella bursa pastoris, Sonchus arvensis, S. oleraceus, Cirsium arvense, Urtica dioica, Potentilla anserina, Gnaphalium uliginosum, Chenopodium album and Ranunculus repens. More durable weeds than the above mentioned species were Galeopsis speciosa, G. tetrahit, Stellana media, Spergula arvensis, Viola tricolor, Polygonum lapathifolium, P. convolvulus, Lamium purpureum, Rumex acetosa, R. acetosella, Matricaria inodora, Achillea millefolium, Anthriscus silvestris, Aegopodium podagraria, Taraxacum vulgare, Leontodon autumnalis, Senecio vulgaris, Galium spurium, Chamamerium angustifolium, Artemisia vulgaris, Mentha arvensis and Stachys paluster. Perfect or were durable were Agropyrum repens, Linaria vulgaris, Centauren cyanus, Solidago virga-aurea, Myosotis arvensis, Plantago major, Pinnaria officinalis and Polygonum aviculare. Among the cultivated plants were Brassica campestris v. rapa, Br. napus v. napobrassica, Br. oleracea, v. capitata, Raphanus sativus v. radiculata, Beta vulgaris v. crassn (food beet), Beta vulgaris v. altissima (sugar beet), Beta vulgaris v. rapa, Daucus carota, Spinacia oleracea, Lactuca sutiva and Petroselinum hortense very sensitive for the hormone poison application. Considerably suffered also Trifolium spp, Pisum spp, Vida saliva, Phaseolus spp., Linum usitatissimum, Cichorium intybus and Ruhus idaeus and also a few decorative plants (Helianthus annuus and Calendula officinalis). The cereal crops (rye, winter wheat, summer wheat, oats and barley) are not damaged in the trials except for barley and summer wheat. The length-growth of barley weakened about 10 cm and m summer wheat appeared a small malformation of ears. The application with plant hormone products did not damage or damaged only a little Pirus malus, Ribes spp, Fragaria grandiflora, Solanum lycopersicum, S. tuberosum, Nicotiana rustica, Armoracia rusticana, Cucumis sativus, Allium spp. and Rheum rhaponticum. Among trees and bushes proved Alnus incarta very sensitive for the hormone applications. The other deciduous trees and bushes have been only a little damaged in the triale and the coniferous trees not at all. Among the hormone products experimented with in these trials were the sprays diluted according to directions for use more effective than the corresponding amounts of dusts (200—250 kg/hc). Greater quantities of dust (300--400 kg kg/hc), however, were as effective as the diluted sprays. Most effective were the strong sprays but they damaged also most culture plants. On sand soils was the effect of hormone products quicker and more perfect than on clay soils. The effect of hormone application turned to be quicker in the middle of the summer than in the later part of it. The effect of the hormone products was obviously better upon plants in the later stage of development, the test series having been organized in the middle and later part of the summer, the effect of hormone products was apparently worse than it might have been after treatments organized in the early part of the summer.",

    "abstract": "Hernekääriäinen (Grapholitha nigricana Steph.) on erittäin yleinen tuhohyönteinen maamme herneviljelyksillä, ja sen toukan aiheuttamat tuhot ovat useina vuosina olleet varsin huomattavat, etenkin maamme varsinaisella herneen viljelysalueella. Maatalouskoelaitoksen kasvinjalostusosastolla Jokioisissa olivat hernekääriäisen aiheuttamat vahingot vv. 1944, 1945 ja 1947 verraten vähäiset. Toukkien syönnistä johtunut suoranainen sadon vähennys vaihteli 2.3—2.8 %:iin ja vioittuneiden herneiden määrä sadossa oli 5.1—11.2 %:a eli 100—170 kg/ha. Vuonna 1946 hernekääriäisen tuhot sitävastoin olivat poikkeuksellisen suuret. Suoranainen satotappio oli keskim. 9.8 % eli 130 kg/ha, vioittuneiden herneiden määrän ollessa 32.8 %. Vioituksen suuruuden ja kukinnan alkamisajan välillä todettiin yksityisinä vuosina melko selvä riippuvaisuussuhde. Aikaisin kukintansa aloittaneet lajikkeet olivat vioittuneet enemmän kuin myöhäiset. Kasvukauden »aikaisuudella» ei näyttänyt olevan vaikutusta riippuvaisuussuhteeseen. Myös kukinta-ajan pituuden havaittiin vaikuttavan vioituksen suuruuteen. Tuhot olivat suurimmat lajikkeilla, joiden kukinta kesti kauan. Selvin oli vuorosuhde niinä vuosina, jolloin kukinta-aika yleensä oli suhteellisen pitkä. Kukinta-ajan pituudella ei kuitenkaan näyttänyt olevan ratkaisevaa merkitystä tuhojen suuruuteen. Niinpä vuonna 1946, jolloin kukinta tapahtui verraten nopeasti, vahingot olivat poikkeuksellisen suuret. Sitävastoin näytti hernekääriäisen muninta-aikana vallinneilla sääsuhteilla olevan tärkeä merkitys toukkien esiintymisrunsauteen. Mainittuna vuonna oli herneen kukinta-aika varsin lämmin ja poutainen. Vaihtelut vioituksen suuruudessa eri lajikkeilla näyttävät johtuvan pääasiassa lajikkeiden aikaisuuden ja kukinta-ajan pituuden eroista. Koska lajikkeiden varsinaisessa kestävyydessä hernekääriäisen tuhoja vastaan ei näyttänyt olevan mainittavia eroja, lienee kasvinjalostustyöllä varsin vähän mahdollisuuksia vähentää hernekääriäisen aiheuttamia vahinkoja. Päähuomio olisi näinollen kiinnitettävä kemiallisten torjuntakeinojen kehittämiseen tehokkaiksi ja taloudellisesti kannattaviksi. Myös olisi syytä selvitellä mahdollisuuksia vähentää kääriäistuhoja muilla torjuntamenetelmillä.",

Nopein lypsäjä on käyttänyt maitokilon lypsämiseen keskim. vain 0.55 min. eli 33 sek. Edelleen ilmenee tutkimuksesta, jossa aineisto on ryhmitelty kolmeen ryhmään sen mukaan, minkälaista lypsäjänmerkkiä vastaavan tuloksen kukin lypsäjä on saanut, että mestari- ja I luokan lypsäjät (1. ryhmä) ovat lypsäneet maitokilon keskimäärin 1.00 ± 0.004 minuutissa, II luokan lypsäjät (2. ryhmä) 1.23 ± 0.005 minuutissa ja huonoimman ryhmän, III luokan lypsäjät (3. ryhmä) 1.37 ± 0.003 minuutissa keskimääräisen lypsykerralla saadun maitomäärän ollessa lehmää kohti vastaavasti eri ryhmissä 6.52, 6.09 ja 6.04 kg. Lypsyn nopeuden, joka on arvosteltu maitokilon lypsyyn käytetyn keskimääräisen ajan perusteella, ja lypsyssä saadun maitomäärän välillä on kaikissa eri tasoisia lypsäjiä käsittelevissä tutkimusryhmissä ollut selvä riippuvaisuus vuorosuhdekertoimen ollessa -0.40 ± 0.01 koko aineistossa Maitokilon lypsämiseen käytetty keskimääräinen aika siis pienenee lypsetyn maitomäärän suuretessa. Riippuvaisuus ei ole kuitenkaan suoraviivainen, vaan maitomäärän lisääntyessä 2—3 kg:sta maitokilon lypsämiseen käytetty keskimääräinen aika aluksi laskee varsin jyrkästi (0.06—0.20 min./kg) 6—7 maitokiloon asti, ja siitä lähtien hitaammin (keskim. 0.03 min./kg) maitomäärän edelleen noustessa 11—12 kg:aan asti. Aineistonryhmitys eri tasolla olevien lypsäjien kesken osoittaa, että maitokilon lypsämiseen käytetty keskimääräinen aika pienenee maitomäärän kasvaessa huolimatta lypsyyn käytetystä kokonaisajasta, joka esim. 11.5 kg:n lypsyssä olevilla lehmillä vaihtelee eritasoisten lypsäjien ryhmissä 9.78 minuutista 12.42 minuuttiin. Käytettävissä olleen aineiston perusteella ei voida kuitenkaan tehdä johtopäätöksiä siitä, miten lypsyn keskimääräinen nopeus muuttuu lypsetyn maitomäärän yhtä lehmää ja lypsykertaa kohti noustessa yli 11—12 kg, mutta viittaa se joka tapauksessa siihen, että tämän yläpuolella saavutetaan raja, josta alkaen keskimääräinen lypsynopeus hidastuu. Lypsettäessä lehmäpareja, joiden maitomäärät vaihtelevat 5 kg:sta 23 kg:aan, maitokilon lypsämiseen käytetty keskimääräinen aika pienenee lypsetyn maitomäärän kasvaessa ja on tämä keskimääräisen lypsynopeuden kasvu vähälypsyisillä lehmäpareilla huomattavasti suurempi kuin runsaslypsyisillä. Samoin tutkimuksesta selviää, ettei maitokilon lypsämiseen käytetty keskimääräinen aika, silloin kun lehmäparin maitomäärä pysyy samana, sanottavasti riipu sen muodostavien lehmien keskinäisistä maitomääristä, vaan lypsyn nopeuteen vaikuttaa eniten lehmäparin kokonaismaitomäärä. Jälkimaidon määrä on tämän tutkimuksen mukaan ollut keskim. 6.90 ± 0.07 cm3 lehmää kohti. Mestari- ja 1 luokan lypsäjillä jälkimaidon määrä on ollut 6.48 ± 0.09 cm3, II luokan lypsäjillä 6.89 ± 0.11 cm3 ja III luokan lypsäjillä 7.71 ± 0,13 cm3. 80.5 %:lla lehmistä on jälkimaidon määrä ollut alle 10 cm3 ja vain 2.1 %:lla yli 20 cm3 Jälkimaidon ja lypsetyn maitomäärän välinen vuorosuhdekerroin +0.05 ± 0.01 osoittaa, että jälkimaidonmäärä on riippumaton lypsetyn maitomäärän suuruudesta. Lypsetyn maidon keskimääräinen puhtaus lehmää kohti on ollut 4.68+ 0.004 pistettä korkeimman mahdollisen pistemäärän ollessa 5. Eri luokkien lypsäjillä puhtauden keskimääräiset pistearvot ovat vaihdelleet 4.55 - 4.70, parhaan keskimääräisen pistemäärän ollessa mestari- ja I luokan lypsäjillä ja huonoimman III luokan lypsäjillä. Lypsetyn maidon puhtaus on ollut täysin riippumaton maitomääristä, vuorosuhdekertoimen ollessa —0.04 ± 0.01.",

Von diesen Ertragsposten erscheinen bei Berechnung des Volkseinkommens zwar der Ertrag der Weide als Abzug in der Haustierwirtschaft sowie der Düngerwert und ein Teil der Pferdearbeit als Abzüge beim Pflanzenanbau, dagegen vermehren der Wert der nicht zu den fort laufenden Landwirtschaftsarbeiten gehörenden Prerdearbeit und der Wert der Urbarmachung das Volkseinkommen.",

    "abstract": "Considering the decisive importance of fecundity on the whole Finnish cattle-breeding industry, the author has tried in the following research, which still is in its first phases, to bring forth some points of view, with which the selection of animals to be bred together could be made still more effective. Material has sofar only been collected from the districts of south-western Finland and Kuopio agricultural associations. The former includes west-Finnish and Ayrshire cattle, the cattle of the Kuopio province agricultural association area, on the other hand, chiefly consisting east-Finnish home-breed. The number of born twins has been examined in the research, their effect on production of the cow and later fecundity. In addition to this overtime calvings of cows have been examined, and to what extent breeding selection regarding proliferation can be rendered more effective on basis of this. A cow with an interval of 15 months or more between two successive calvings has been considered overtime. The material has been collected from reports sent to the Cattle-Breeding Dept, of the Agricultural Experimentary Institution by agricultural associations. Only cows who during their life-time have been more than twice overtime, have been recorded as overtimes. Material regarding twinresearch in the east-Finnish cattle remains for the time being considerably small, but the results have in any cace been published in this connection. The research continues and is extended to include all Finland’s 22 agricultural associations. The most important results of research are explained in the following summary 1) Cows giving twins have totalled 1,97 % of the Ayrshire cattle, 1,69 % of the western-Finnisch cattle and 0,63 % of the east-Finnish cattle. The small number of twins, in comparison with other groups, in the east-Finnish cattle may possible be a results of poorer feeding conditions. Calculated on basis of a single calving and in the above mentioned order, the number of twins born has been 0,33 %, 0,28 % and 0,09 %. Cows giving birth to two pairs of twins have amounted to 18,6 % in the Ayrshire cattle, 16,2 % in the western-Finnish cattle and 14,7 % in the east-Finnish cattle calculated on basis of the total number of twins born. Cows giving three pairs of twins have totalled in the above order 3.0 %, 2,7 % and 1,1 %. Both the Ayrshire and western-Finnish breeds include one cow who has given birth to four pairs of twins. Cows of an age higher than 10 years, which according to calculations made by the author is the average age of a Finnish cow, giving twins have totalled in the Ayrshire cattle 15,9 % of all Ayrshire cows giving twins, and correspondingly in the western-Finnish breed 19,6 % and in the east-Finnish breedc 25,7 %. 2) Twins including both sexes total about 50 % in the various breeds, and twins with only male or female calves about 25 % each. 3) Dead-born and back-to-life brought twin-individuals calculated from the total number of twins number in the above mentioned order in Ayrshire cattle 9.7 % and 11,5 %, in western-Finnish cattle 13,1 % and 8,7 % and in the east-Finnish cattle 10,5 % and 9,6 %. The birth of death-born female calves has been the smallest, and greatest among twins including both sexes. Female-calf twins have also included the greatest number of back-to-life brought calves. It is also worth observing that in some cases the female calf of a pair of twins including both sexes, has been brought to life, although it generally when mature remains infertile. 4) The differences in numbers of twins born during various months have been considerably small, but it seems, however, that both the Ayrshire and western-Finnish breeds generally give birth to more twins in the autumn and in March—April. With the east-Finnish breed March-—April months have also proven very succesful regarding twins. All examined breeds have included the greatest number of dead-born twins during July—August. 5) The production of milk and fats reached during the year of birth of twins, as also the fat-percentage in the milk, have been somewhat smaller than the corresponding productions during the year before and the year after. The mentioned differences however have no greater practical importance. 6) Cows twice or more overtimed included in those producing twins number in Ayrshire cattle 9,1 %, in western-Finnish cattle 2.7 % and in east-Finnish cattle 2,0 %, the corresponding percentages in the total cattles being 1,6 %, 0,7 % and 0.3 %. Of cows producing twins 13,2 % have become infertile in Ayrshire cattle, 13,3 % in western-Finnish cattle and 5,3 % in east-Finnish cattle, the average percentage of infertility in Finnish cattle being about 4-—5 %. The birth of twins thus severely overstrains the function of the cows sexual organs. 7) The daughters of twin-producing cows have despite their young age been more often overtime and infertile than the cows in the Finnish cattle to an average are. 8) Of cows who during their life-time have at least twice been overtime, 19,6 % in Ayrshire cattle have become infertile, the corresponding percentage in western-Finnish cattle being 24,5 % and in east-Finnish 12,8 %. 9) The daughters of overtime cows have become unregularly in calf or been infertile, some already after the first calving. 10) Of the 49 examined east-Finnish bulls, whose mothers and fathers mothers have been overtime or infertile, 24,8 % have produced cow-descendants which have been either weakly pregnant or infertile. 11) The mother or grandmothers from the fathers or mothers side, of the 17 east-Finnish bulls proved infertile, have either been overtime or later infertile. As a practical result of the above conclusions it can be established, that the birth of twins overstrains the sexual organs of the cow and can in many cases cause infertility. Inclination to giving twins in thus one of the factors decreasing fecundity, the effect of which is even felt in the daughters. In order to preserve regular pregnancy of cattle and to advance it, cows producing twins or even their descendants ought not to be chosen as pedigree animals or even as parents of bulls. In connection with examining of overtime births it has become evident, that cows twice or more overtime have later become infertile as also despite for the time being considerably small material it has become unquestionably evident, that both overtimedness and infertility are also dependant on hereditary factors. When developing permanent breeding cows and bulls the selection has thus to be directed to such mothers, who in addition to their other valuable characteristics have regularly become pregnant. As both overtimedness and inferiltity can be results of such outside factors, the elimination of which also causes the above drawbacks to disappear, it is possible, that in developing permanent breeding cows even mentioned modifications can be removed from breeding. For avoiding this naturally the fact whether infertility and overtimedness are caused by outside factors can to the extent possible be found out. According to my own opinion, however, only single overtimednesses may cause any reason for this, and especially if it is noticed in several cows in the same cattle. If, on the other hand, a second or further overtimednes or infertility is in question these individuals must be without mercy eliminated from the breeding-stock. Only a sharp breeding selection of this description can guarantee that all individuals with unadvantageous hereditary factors regarding fecundity, are eliminated from breeding. It is always practical to use inbreeding in various lines in turn in the cattle to guarantee results and establish the factors effecting fecundity naturally presupposing that the material is sufficient.",

    "abstract": "The significance of fruit lesions of different kinds in brown-rot infection has been investigated. M. fructigena conidia were rubbed with a paint brush on the surface of apples uninjured and injured in different ways. All the uninjured fruits remained healthy. Slight injury done by copperlime 0.5 % (Cuprosan 3) and smallish spots, without cracking of the fruit, due to apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) were also unfavorable to the penetration of the brown-rot fungus. Infection in the former case was 0 %, in the later 7.1 % of apples inoculated. The inoculation of apples with severe corking and cracking resulted in 20.0 % infection and the inoculation of fruits injured by the codling moth (Carpocapsa pomonella) in 75.0 % respectively. All the fruits were infected when conidia were placed in a wound made with a knife-blade. It is thought that the susceptibility of lesions of different kinds to the brown-rot fungus is chiefly due to the moisture of the substrate and the air in the immediate proximity of the growing hypha. Spraying with the usual fungicides appears to be successful in controlling the brown-rot disease only if every fresh wound is covered (12). The control of apple scab and codling moth is also of importance, to avoid lesions made by these. It was thought that a compound penetrating the fruit tissues might be effective in controlling the disease through inhibiting the growth of mycelium in the tissues. One such chemical penetrating the plant tissues is diethylnitrophenylthiophosphate (E 606) (6). Parathion is found to inhibit the growth of Sclerotinia fructigena conidia (1). The fungistatic action on the brown-rot fungus of Parathion and some other chemicals penetrating the fruit tissues was investigated in the laboratory by dipping apples of the variety Charlottenthal or soaking them for 24 and 48 hours in the liquids. Every treatment consisted of 6 apples. Table 2. shows the daily growth of the brown-rot spot on apples treated in different ways and inoculated. The growth rate is shown in figure 2. Dipping, which corresponds in effect to one spraying (6), in 0.1 % mercuric chloride and in 0.1 % Cheminova-Parathion retarded the growth of the fungus. Soaking for 24 hours in Parathion reduced the growth greatly, soaking for 48 hours made the growth poor. Soaking in 0.05 % copper sulphate, 0.5 % tannin, 1 % ferrous sulphate and 0.1 % hydroquinone, too, retarded the growth of the fungus. The observations indicate that Parathion possesses an obvious fungistatic action on the brown-rot fungus and is possibly efficient in controlling it. For this reason a preliminary spraying experiment was carried out in 1950. The results indicate that Parathion was the preparation most successful in controlling the disease. This is due to the fungistatic action of Parathion and also to its insecticidal properties. Further investigations are needed into the significance of Parathion compounds in the control of the brown-rot disease.",

Die Kühe waren in zwei Gruppen eingeteilt, die in Alter und Gewicht möglichst gleich waren. Beiden Gruppen wurde dasselbe Grundfutter gegeben. Die Kühe der einen Gruppe erhielten ausserdem täglich je Tier 100 g »Vevoron», ein Präparat, das etwa 5 % 4-Methyl-2-Thiouracil enthält. Der Versuch dauerte 37 Tage. Danach wurden die Kühe geschlachtet und im Zusammenhang mit dem Schlachten verschiedene Wägungen ausgeführt (vgl. Tabelle 2). Ausserdem bestimmte man bei allen Tieren den Trockensubstanz- und den Fettgehalt einer bei allen Tieren an derselben Körperstelle entnommenen Fleisch- und einer Leberprobe. Folgende Ergebnisse stellten sich heraus. 1) Bei den Tieren der Thiouracilgruppe nahm das Lebendgewicht durchschnittlich 47.2 kg, bei denen der Normalgruppe 27.6 kg zu, so dass als Thiouracilwirkung 19.6kg Zunahme im Lebendgewicht je Tier in 37 Tagen sich ergaben. 2) Das durchschn. Gewicht der Rümpfe, ohne Blut, Haut, Kopf und Füsse, war bei der Thiouracilgruppe um 31.4 kg grösser als bei der Normalgruppe. 3) Nach dem Ausweiden und Abkühlen der Rümpfe war ihr durchschnittliches Gewicht bei der Thiouracilgruppe nur noch 4.2 kg grösser, so dass der Mehrbetrag im Lebendgewicht hauptsächlich auf dem grösseren Gewicht der Eingeweide beruhte. 4) Da die Thiouracilgruppe durchschnittlich je Kuh 0.4 kg weniger Eingeweidefette hatte und z.B. die Leber durchschn. nur 0.5 kg mehr wog, hat das Mehrgewicht der Eingeweide, das 25.2 kg betrug ,bei dieser Gruppe fast ausschliesslich auf der grösseren Füllung der Vormägen und der Gedärme beruht. 5) Vorausgesetzt, dass das Fleischgewicht bei beiden Gruppen denselben Prozentsatz vom Lebendgewicht sowohl zu Beginn als auch bei Beendigung des Versuchs ausgemacht hätte, kommt man zu dem Ergebnis, dass das Thiouracil eine Zunahme von nur etwa 2 kg im Fleischgewicht verursacht hätte. Auch wenn sie nur blosses Fett gewesen wäre, hätte sich die Anwendung von Thiouracil wirtschaftlich nicht rentabel gestaltet. 6) Sowohl im Trockensubstanz- als im Fettgehalt von Fleisch und Leber der Thiouraciltiere hat gegenüber den Normaltieren kein Unterscheid festgestellt werden können. Dagegen hatten die Thiouraciltiere augenscheinlich etwas mehr Nierentalg als die Kühe der Normalgruppe, die nur minimal wenig davon aufwiesen. 7) Verfasser stellt die Hypothese dar, dass die in verschiedenen Fällen verschieden mästende Wirkung von Thiouracil davon abhängig sein kann, wie stark oder schwach die auf den Hormonabsonderungen beruhenden natürlichen Neigungen zur Mast bei den Tieren sind. Je besser diese Neigungen sind, desto grösser ist die Wirkung, die das Thiouracil ausübt.",

Tässä mielessä tutkittiin muunteluanalyysimenetelmää käyttäen eroavaisuudet eri sonnien jälkeläisryhmien ja eroavaisuudet isänpuolisten sisarusten välillä sekä tilapäisen että pysyväisen hedelmättömyyden ilmenemisessä.

Pysyväistä hedelmättömyyttä tutkittaessa annettiin niille tapauksille, joissa lehmät tiinehtyivät, arvo 1, ja niille tapauksille, joissa lehmät poistettiin mahoina, aivo 0. Tutkimus osoittaa, että samoissa karjoissa olevista samanikäisistä lehmistä kokoonpantujen eri sonnien jälkeläisryhmien välillä on eroja sekä tilapäisen että pysyväisen hedelmättömyyden ilmenemiseen nähden.

    "abstract": "Lately there have been injurious winters for the cultivation of fruit in Finland in 1915—1917, 1927—1929 and 1939—1942. The winter 1946—1947 again damaged fruit trees and the berry-bushes gooseberry, currant and raspberry; this damage was most severe in the best areas for cultivation of fruit in Varsinais-Suomi (Ab) and Satakunta (St). In these areas about 10—75 % of the fruit trees and 75—80 % of the berry-bushes were injured or died. Slight injuries generally have been noted in Uusimaa (N), Häme (Ta), in the Valley of Kokemakiriver (St) and in the neighbourhood of Tampere (Ta). In southern Pohjanmaa (Oa) fruit trees and berry-bushes have been injured, too. The limit of the general injury-area is drawn through Vaasa (Oa), Alavus (Oa) and Virolahti (Ka). This limit closely follows the contour-line, to the west and southwest of which the depht of snow on March 15th was 30 cm or less (fig. 2). In the injury-area mentioned damage was such that the leaves expanded slowly in the spring, the flower buds, that appeared abundantly, opened slowly and the leaves and fruit were smaller than normally. In severely damaged trees the flower buds did not open, but dried up (fig. 1). In damaged trees, the cambium was generally brownish, the wood drier than normally, the roots, however, were generally white within and vigorous. The leaves of the berry-bushes expanded slowly in the spring; later in summer a many of the branches of damaged bushes died. These bushes generally grew new branches from their root. The damage to fruit trees and berry-bushes was due to the drying of the parts above ground in the spring, when the warm and sunny weathers induced activity of the vital functions in the plants. The soil was, however, deeply frozen because of the thin winter snowcover and when the thaw waters and rainwaters in May, with a little amount of rain, did not melt the ice, the roots were still in June in the frozen soil and did not absorb enough water from the soil, which even apart from this was too dry, to make up the evaporated moisture. Then the soft surface parts of the trees, rind and buds, were damaged. In summer the roots may perhaps have absorbed a normal amount of water, but because of the damage to the vascular system in the rind the flowing of solutions in the summer was not normal, and the shoots, leaves and fruits grew weakly. The damage to fruit trees was neither due to properties the variety and stock nor the age of trees (6). In the central parts of the country twigs of trees and sapling fruit trees were frozen because of the severe frost in winter. It can be estimated that 20—25 % of the fruit yield in Finland in 1947 was lost for the winter injuries.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work is to give the reader a general picture of the main constituents of some varieties of peat found in Finland, and the significance of these constituents in fuel peat. Attention has primarily been focussed on the thermodynamically important constituents of peat, i.e. bitumen, water soluble organic substances, proteins, substances hydrolyzable with acid (cellulose, hemicelluloses), substances unhydrolyzable with acid (lignin and the products of the decomposition of lignin) and ash. The method of analysis chiefly used was that of Waksman and Stevens, which was. however, somewhat abbreviated. The following varieties of peat were used: 8 samples of pure Sphagnum peat (S-peat), 7 samples of Carex peat (C-peat) of which three contained some wood waste (LC-peat) and one some unchanged Carex rostrata, 4 samples of Amblystegium Carex peat (AC-peat) and a profile consisting of Sphagnum peat containing some Eriophorum peat (Er S-peat). The samples were gathered in Northern Finland. Ash: After discussion of the factors influencing the ash content of peat and the composition of the ash, the results of the peat analyses carried out are considered. The ash of the acid soluble fraction contains mainly sesqui-oxides while the ash of the insoluble residue chiefly consists of SiO2 and silicates (secondary ash) (Table 2). Table 3 shows that: 1) The lightly humified surface peat (H1 —H2) generally contains considerably more water soluble ash and less acid soluble ash than the more humified peat; 2) The acid soluble ash constituents seem to increase with the dept (decreasing acidity and precipitation of metal hydroxides); 3) Analyses of AC-peat show more acid soluble and less insoluble ash than Sand C-peat (this agrees with the higher pH-value of AC-peat). Bitumen. The nature of bitumen, the methods of estimating the bitumen content of peat, and of previous investigations are discussed. The bitumen content of 30 samples of Er S-peat was determined by extraction with a benzene-alcohol mixture (1 : 1). The results are set out in Fig. T. Table 4 shows the results of the bitumen determinations according to Waksman’s and Stevens’ method. The following conclusions can be drawn: 1) AC-peat contains considerably less bitumen than S-peat and C-peat, and C-peat contains more bitumen than S-peat; 2) The results confirm the old theory that the bitumen content increases more markedly with the degree of humification in S-peat than in C-peat; 3) AC-peat has the smallest ether fraction (30.9 %) expressed in percentage of the total bitumen content, S-peat a somewhat higher (40.5 %), and C-peat the highest percentage (50.8 %). These results agree with those obtained by other scientists from analysis of Scandinavian material, but not with results obtained by American scientists with European and American material (see table 5). Other organic constituents of peat. Fig. 1 shows the trend of change in the chemical composition which occurs in the humification of pure S-peat and S-peat containing some Eriophorum peat. Tables 6 and 7 show that the changes in the C-peat and S-peat follow the same general trend. The most obvious and thermodynamically most important difference in the chemical composition of these two kinds of peat is the considerably greater content of unhydrolyzable substance in the C-peat. Table 8 shows the difference in the composition of C-peat and S-peat. According to this, S-peat would appear to contain about twice as much cellulose and hemi-cellulose as C-peat. S-peat also contains a greater proportion than C-peat of the A-fraction, which is that part of the acid soluble fraction that is not cellulose, hemicellulose or protein but consists mainly of humic acids. In both kinds of peat the least humified samples contained the largest proportion of A-fraction. The expression »Free crude protein» in table 7 means the protein quantity which is equivalent to the water and acid soluble quantity of nitrogen. The cellulose and hemicellulose content of C-peat have been found to be somewhat larger than those mentioned in the literature. The variations in the quantities of water soluble substances in all the samples of peat investigated correspond on the whole with the results published by other scientists. The influence of the chemical composition of peat on its calorific value. Table 9 shows the gross calorific values of the various fractions. The values have been obtained by determining the total gross calorific value, the gross calorific value of the residual fraction, and the gross calorific values of two ether and alcohol soluble fractions. These values have then been used in calculating the gross calorific value of the water and acid soluble fractions and of the bitumen fraction. The probable changes in the calorific values of both the ether and alcohol soluble substances, due to humification, have thus not been accurately taken into consideration. That C-peat has a higher calorific value than S-peat in spite of its higher ash content, is probably due to the following facts: 1) The bitumen content of C-peat is higher 2) The bitumen of C-peat contains more ether soluble substances 3) C-peat contains more proteins, which have a higher calorific value than hydrocarbons 4) C-peat contains more carbonaceous substances (lignin etc.) that are unhydrolyzable with acids. 5) The substances in C-peat which are unhydrolyzable with acids have higher calorific values than those of S-peat. Thus the calorific value of peat does not depend only on the quantities of the various fractions in peat forming plants and the corresponding varieties of peat, but also on the variations in the chemical composition of these fractions.",

    "abstract": "The instructions of the Finnish agricultural statistics, Board of Survey and communal taxation measurements for classification of land utilization types differ from each another, thus making it difficult to compare and to control the preliminary data of statistics. Definitions of land utilization classes have been inadequate causing uncertainty in information about area. In the present investigation a proposal has been made for a new classification which would be better comparable than the former one with the classification of the Board of Survey as well as for a more detailed definition of land utilization types. The aim of the definitions has been to attain such characteristic features which enable drawing of a definite line between different land utilization types even when persons with little training are employed as collectors of the required information. Besides, the principle adhered to, when determining the class of land utilization, has been not to take into account the temporary use of land outside its regular use. The land area belonging to one agricultural enterprise (excluding waters) is divided according to the new proposal to the following main groups: I. Agricultural land 11. Cultivable land 111. Actual forest land IV. Waste land. The agricultural land is divided into the following groups according to its use 1. Garden (orchard and vegetable garden) 2. Field. 3. Permanent pasture on fields 4. Meadow (natural meadow). 5. Cleared pasture. 6. Building site, roads, etc. The cleared pastures include enclosed treeless and stumpy pasture lands and in addition to these natural meadows similarly enclosed and permanently used as pasture. The cultivable land is divided into cultivable open peat moss and cultivable forest land. The latter together with the actual forest land forms the group which corresponds to the earlier forest land group. Proposed practice makes comparison with surveying areas easier.",

    "abstract": "Die Partien finnischer Timotheesamen enthalten ungefähr ein halbes Prozent Straussgrassamen (Agrostis spp). Diese sind vor allem Samen des Gemeinen Straussgrases (A. tenuis SIBTH), seltener kommen Samen des Hunds-Straussgrases (A. canina L.) vor und noch seltener Samen des weissen Straussgrases oder Fioringrases (A. stolonifera L.). Während der ersten dreissig Jahre wurden in der Staatlichen Samenkontrollanstalt alle Straussgrassamen als Unkrautsamen betrachtet. Als im Herbst 1949 Timotheesamen nach U.S.A. ausgeführt wurden, und Straussgras wird in U.S.A. den Nutzpflanzen zugeordnet, wurden auch hier seit Anfang November 1949 die Straussgrassamen getrennt vom Exporttimothee als Kulturpflanzen gewogen. Und seit Anfang Dezember 1949 wurden in der Staatlichen Samenkontrollanstalt Finnlands bei allen Proben ohne Ausnahme alle Straussgrassamen als Kulturpflanzen gesondert gewogen. Aber Straussgräser sind trotzdem eben Straussgräser. Ihr Kulturwert hat sich trotzdem nicht verändert. Straussgrasarten sind solche Pflanzen, die sich gegen der Wunsch des Bauern in den Kulturen ausbreiten. Beim Feststellen der Mindestanforderungen an Saatgut in der Verkaufsperiode 1949—1950 ist dieser Umstand bereits beachtet worden. Denn da es unter den Unkrautsamen keine Straussgrassamen mehr gibt und diese nach unserer Statistik durchschnittlich ein halbes % vom Timotheesamen ausgemacht haben, ist beim Feststellen der Mindestanforderungen an den Timothee gestattet worden, den höchsten Gehalt der Unkrautsamen um ein halbes Prozent zu senken. Obgleich also das Straussgras vom Linkraut unterschieden und als Kulturpflanze bezeichnet wird, ist man hinsichtlich der Unkrautsamen ebenso streng wie früher.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is briefly to examine the influence that the distance to the fields has on the profitableness on 91 farms of size class III (from 25 to 50 of converted field), wich during 1934 —1939 were reviewed by the Board of Agriculture. The farms are grouped, according to the average distance to the fields, in 3 groups: A, average distance under 600 meters; B, average distance from 600 to 1 000 m. and C, average distance over 1 000 m. Further they are grouped according to size into group I from 25 to 37,5 converted field hectares and group II from 37,5 to 50 converted field hectares. The research shows that the net profit and percentage of profitableness diminish considerably when the average distance to the fields increases (tables 4 and 5) and that the decrease is much steeper in connection with changes in small distance groups than with respect to similar changes in higher distance brackets. But the expenditure of work, on the other side, does not notably increase and the management costs do in fact diminish when the distance increases. This is a result of a considerable lowering in the intensity of the field and the overall cultivation of the farm as the location of the fields becomes less favourable. The diminution of the net profit is a consequence of the decrease in total yields. The earlier method of taking the loss of time caused by the location of fields into calculations on different crops and to make the deductions as to the influence of the distance to the fields on the profitableness of farming directly from these calculations, is therefore not in harmony with practical facts.",

Tässä mielessä tutkittiin muunteluanalyysimenetelmää käyttäen eroavaisuudet eri sonnien jälkeläisryhmien ja eroavaisuudet isänpuolisten sisarusten välillä sekä tilapäisen että pysyväisen hedelmättömyyden ilmenemisessä. Tilapäistä hedelmättömyyttä tutkittaessa annettiin niille tapauksille, joissa lehmät tiinehtyivät ensimmäisellä astutuksella, arvo 1, ja niille tapauksille, joissa lehmät eivät tiinehtyneet ensimmäisellä astutuksella, arvo 0. Pysyväistä hedelmättömyyttä tutkittaessa annettiin niille tapauksille, joissa lehmät tiinehtyivät, arvo 1, ja niille tapauksille, joissa lehmät poistettiin mahoina, aivo 0. Tutkimus osoittaa, että samoissa karjoissa olevista samanikäisistä lehmistä kokoonpantujen eri sonnien jälkeläisryhmien välillä on eroja sekä tilapäisen että pysyväisen hedelmättömyyden ilmenemiseen nähden. Todennäköisyys, että todetut erot johtuisivat ainoastaan satunnaisista syistä, on edellisessä tapauksessa pienempi kuin 1 : 100 ja jälkimäisessä tapauksessa pienempi kuin 1 : 1000. Myös samoissa karjoissa olevien samanikäisten isänpuolisten sisarusten välillä on mainituissa suhteissa eroja, ja todennäköisyys, että nämä erot johtuisivat ainoastaan satunnaisista syistä, on pienempi kuin 1 ; 1000. Saurin osa lehmien tiinehtyväisyyden vaihteluista, johtuu kuitenkin satunnaisista tai tutkimuksessa selvittämättömiksi jääneistä syistä. Perinnöllisistä tekijöistä on laskettu johtuvan ainoastaan noin 5 % vaihtelusta, joka aiheutuu siitä, että lehmät joko tulevat tai eivät tule tiineiksi ensimmäisellä astutuksella. Vastaavasti noin 10 % vaihtelusta, joka johtuu siitä, että lehmät joko tulevat tiineiksi tai poistetaan mahouden takia, on perinnöllisten tekijöiden aiheuttamaa.",

    "abstract": "In der Studie wird berichtet über die Untersuchungen, die im Sommer 1945 auf den Uferkulturen der zum Gewässergebiet des Oulujoki gehörenden Seen Pirttijärvi und Nuasjärvi ausgeführt worden sind über den Schaden, der den Kulturpflanzen durch das gegen Ende Juni eingetretene Hochwasser verursacht worden ist. Die Wasserstands- und Niederschlagsverhältnisse sowie die durchschnittlichen Wachstumszeiten im Untersuchungsgebiet sind in Abb. 1 wiedergegeben. Ausser den augenscheinlichen, die Schaden- und Abgangsgrenzen der verschiedenen Pflanzen angehenden Nivellierungen, deren Mittelwertergebnisse aus Tabelle 1 hervorgehen, sind den verschiedenen morphologischen Eigenschaften der Getreidepflanzen zugewandte Untersuchungen auf Grund von Ähren(Rispen-)proben aus den Kulturen ausgeführt worden. Zu jeder Probe haben 20 Ähren gehört. Die einer Probe entsprechenden Messungswerte sind in relative Werte umgerechnet und auf ihrer Grundlage graphische Darstellungen ausgearbeitet worden zu den Figuren 2—4, die also die Abhängigkeit der verschiedenen morphologischen Eigenschaften vom Wasserstand widerspiegeln. Ausserdem sind auch für 1 m2 grosse Probeflächen Ertragsbestimmungen ausgeführt worden, deren Ergebnisse aus Abb. G hervorgehen. Die Untersuchungen lehren, dass die Abgangsgrenze sich bei den verschiedenen Kulturpflanzen recht deutlich abhebt. Unter den Kulturpflanzen hat sich der Timothee in der Wasserresistenz als am besten erwiesen. Seiner Abgangsgrenze hat eine etwa 20tägige, der des Leins eine 14tägige und der des Roggens eine 11tägige Wasserdecke entsprochen. Die Abgangsgrenze von Hafer und Klee hat in der Hochwassergrenze gelegen, die der Gerste wiederum 3cm und die der Kartoffel 10 cm höher. Die Schadengrenze hat sich bei den Wiesenpflanzen schwer festlegen lassen. Sie hat sich wenigstens nicht viel höher als die Abgangsgrenze hingezogen. Bei den übrigen Pflanzen hat die Schadengrenze durch schnittlich etwa 30 cm oberhalb der Abgangsgrenze gelegen. Der Wasserschaden äussert sich bei den Kulturpflanzen teilweise als Lichtung des Bestandes, sehr stark aber auch als Minderung der Anzahl der in der Ähre enthaltenen Körner. Auf die Korngrösse hat das Hochwasser verhältnismässig wenig eingewirkt. Auf Grund der Untersuchungen sind die Kurven in Abb. 5 gezeichnet, die für den betreffenden Sommer die relativen Erträge von Roggen, Gerste und Hafer im Vergleich zum Mittelwasser des 30tägi gen Hochwasserstandes zeigen. Es sei bemerkt, dass der grösste Teil der Beobachtungen Sandtonböden betroffen hat und dass der Boden bei eintretendem Hochwasser infolge der reichlichen Niederschläge verhältnissmässig feucht gewesen ist Früher sind Untersuchungen über die Wirkung der am Anfang und am Ende der Vegetationszeit eingetretenen Hochwasser auf die Kulturen ausgeführt worden. Auf Grund dieser drei verschiedenen Zeitpunkten entsprechenden Untersuchungen ist in Abb. 7 eine Darstellung gegeben, die erkennen lässt, wie lange die verschiedenen Pflanzen die Wasserdecke vertragen haben, bevor ihr Ertrag im grossen ganzen verlorengegangen ist. In Anbetracht der verschiedenartigen Untersuchungsverhältnisse hat die Darstellung jedoch nur als richtunggebend zu gelten. Die Wiesenpflanzen scheinen im beginnenden Frühjahr, wenn der Boden gefroren ist, eine Wasserdecke bedeutend besser als im Mittsommer vertragen zu haben. Die Kulturpflanzen zeigen sich am empfindlichsten gegenüber dem Hochwasser, das im Mittsommer, wenn der Wachstumsvorgang am lebhaftesten ist, auf die Kulturen steigt. In der Reifezeit können sie sogar eine verhältnissmässig lang andauernde Wasserdecke vertragen. Es ist beobachtet worden, dass sich die Abgangsgrenze undeutlich ausbildet, wenn das Hochwasser zeitig im Frühjahr und gegen Ende der Vegetationszeit eintritt. Im ersteren Fall verursacht das Hochwasser hauptsächlich eine Lichtung des Bestandes, durch die die Undeutlichkeit der Abgangsgrenze bewirkt wird. Das in der Reifezeit eingetretene Hochwasser beeinflusst in erster Linie nur die Korngrösse, weswegen die Abgangsgrenze erst mittels Kornuntersuchungen festgelegt werden kann.",

    "abstract": "In Schweden gibt es, so schätzt man auf Grund einer 1944 angestellten Berechnung, an vollauf wirksamen Dränungen im ganzen Lande etwa 974.000 ha oder 26.2 % der gesamten Ackerfläche. In den mittel- und nordschwedischen Anbaugebieten, die sich sowohl klimatisch als auch edaphisch am ehesten mit Finnland vergleichen lassen, ist die Dränungstätigkeit nicht gleich lebhaft gewesen wie weiter südlich, aber auch in diesem Gebiet sind etwa 170.000 ha gedränt, von denen etwa 66 % durch Tonröhren entwässert sind. In ganz Finnland beläuft sich der Dränungsbetrag nach der landwirtschaftlichen Umfrage von 1941 auf nur etwa 120.000 ha oder 5.2 % der Ackerfläche, wovon die Tonröhrendränung etwa 70 % ausmacht. Sowohl in der Planung der Dränungen als auch in der Durchführung der Arbeiten befolgt man in Schweden und Finnland trotz gleichartiger Verhältnisse recht stark voneinander abweichende Verfahrensweisen. So benutzt man in Schweden um 30—50 cm flachere Dräne als in Finland unter entsprechenden Verhältnissen und auch in den nördlichsten Länen des Landes fast gleiche Tiefen wie weiter südlich. Das geht aus den Antworten auf die an die verschiedenen Wirtschaftsgesellschaften in Mittel- und Nordschweden gesandte Rundfrage recht deutlich hervor (Tabelle 2). In Finnland benutzt man in den südlichen Teilen des Landes eine 120 cm tiefe Dränung (von der Oberseite der Röhre an gemessen), aber weiter nördlich, z.B. im Län Oulu, beträgt die Dränungstiefe infolge der Bodenfrostgefahr schon über 140 cm. In Schweden meint man, jahrzehntelange Erfahrung und ausgeführte Untersuchungen hätten erwiesen, dass die Dräne nicht beschädigt würden, auch wenn der Bodenfrost tiefer als sie hinabreichte. Ferner ist zu bemerken, dass in beiden Ländern nicht einmal in den Jahren 1939—43, die bedeutend kälter als normalerweise gewesen sind, hat festgestellt werden können, dass der Bodenfrost die Dränröhren beschädigt hätte. Somit scheint die Zweckmässigkeit der in Finnland wegen des Bodenfrostes benutzten tiefen Dränung zweifelhaft. Dass in Finnland, auch in seinen südlichen Teilen, tiefere Dräne angewandt werden als in Schweden, ist nicht allein auf die Gefahr des Bodenfrostes sondern auch auf die der Wurzelverstopfung zurückzuführen. Da sich die Wurzeln in der Tiefenrichtung schnell vermindern, meint man, die Gefahr des Entstehens von Wurzelverstopfungen sei geringer, wenn eine tiefere Entwässerung angewandt wird. Auch in dieser Hinsicht scheinen die Auffassungen in Schweden und Finnland einigermassen auseinanderzugehen. So werden in Schweden in den Gebieten vieler Wirtschaftsgesellschaften in Gartenländercien dieselben Dränungstiefen wie in Ackerboden angewandt (Tabelle 2). In Finnland dagegen beläuft sich die Dränungstiefe in den Cartenböden im ganzen Lande auf 140 cm. Die Auffassung, die Gefahr der Wurzelverstopfung sei bei tiefer Entwässerung nicht geringer als bei flacher, scheint denn auch in den letzten Jahren in Schweden immer allgemeiner geworden zu sein. Als Schattenseite flacher Dränung wird gegenüber einer tieferen angeführt, dass sie auch die Auswaschung von Pflanzennährstoffen fördere, aber diesem Umstand dürfte bei den im allgemeinen dichtstrukturierten finnischen Böden keine ausschlaggebende Bedeutung zukommen. Die von der Notwendigkeit der eigentlichen Entwässerung vorausgesetzte günstigste Dränungstiefe wie auch der Wasserbedarf der Pflanzen und seine Kapazität sind in den verschiedenen Phasen der Vegetationsperiode verschieden. Bei den Feldversuchen zur Dränungstätigkeit hat man in Finnland jedoch bisher keineswegs herauszustellen gesucht, bei welcher Dräntiefe das günstigste Ertragsergebnis zu erzielen wäre. Obgleich beim Übergang zu flacherer Dränung die bisher benutzten Dränabstände etwas zu verringern wären, würden sich die Aushebungskosten der Dräne wie auch vor allem der Kanäle billiger stellen. Das Ergebnis der Klärung der Frage nach der Tiefe der Dräne ward somit denn auch von weittragendsten wirtschaftlichen Folgen sein, so dass die dafür erforderliche Untersuchungsarbeit auch in Finnland unverzüglich in hinlänglichem Umfang aufzunehmen wäre.",

    "abstract": "In the research carried out observations have been made as to the effect of plant hormone products upon weeds and several cultured crops. In the tests have been used hormone dusts Agroxone and Bayer 2,4 D, also hormone sprays Bayer 2,4 D, Hormotox II, 2—4 Dow Weed Killer and Weedone. The tests or field experiments have been made in Tuusula, 40 km from Helsinki, on the school farm of Järvenpää and also on the farm of Kyrölä. Part of tests was placed in cereal crop cultures, the other parts on potato and beet crops, grasslands, stubble fields, flax cultures, gardens, small woods and free places. The effect of the above named hormone products was different. The most sensitive weeds in the trials were Brassica campestris, Raphanus raphanistrum and Equisetum arvense. Medium sensitive were a great number of weeds as Erysimum cheiranthoides, Thlaspi arvense, Capsella bursa pastoris, Sonchus arvensis, S. oleraceus, Cirsium arvense, Urtica dioica, Potentilla anserina, Gnaphalium uliginosum, Chenopodium album and Ranunculus repens. More durable weeds than the above mentioned species were Galeopsis speciosa, G. tetrahit, Stellana media, Spergula arvensis, Viola tricolor, Polygonum lapathifolium, P. convolvulus, Lamium purpureum, Rumex acetosa, R. acetosella, Matricaria inodora, Achillea millefolium, Anthriscus silvestris, Aegopodium podagraria, Taraxacum vulgare, Leontodon autumnalis, Senecio vulgaris, Galium spurium, Chamamerium angustifolium, Artemisia vulgaris, Mentha arvensis and Stachys paluster. Perfect or were durable were Agropyrum repens, Linaria vulgaris, Centauren cyanus, Solidago virga-aurea, Myosotis arvensis, Plantago major, Pinnaria officinalis and Polygonum aviculare. Among the cultivated plants were Brassica campestris v. rapa, Br. napus v. napobrassica, Br. oleracea, v. capitata, Raphanus sativus v. radiculata, Beta vulgaris v. crassn (food beet), Beta vulgaris v. altissima (sugar beet), Beta vulgaris v. rapa, Daucus carota, Spinacia oleracea, Lactuca sutiva and Petroselinum hortense very sensitive for the hormone poison application. Considerably suffered also Trifolium spp, Pisum spp, Vida saliva, Phaseolus spp., Linum usitatissimum, Cichorium intybus and Ruhus idaeus and also a few decorative plants (Helianthus annuus and Calendula officinalis). The cereal crops (rye, winter wheat, summer wheat, oats and barley) are not damaged in the trials except for barley and summer wheat. The length-growth of barley weakened about 10 cm and m summer wheat appeared a small malformation of ears. The application with plant hormone products did not damage or damaged only a little Pirus malus, Ribes spp, Fragaria grandiflora, Solanum lycopersicum, S. tuberosum, Nicotiana rustica, Armoracia rusticana, Cucumis sativus, Allium spp. and Rheum rhaponticum. Among trees and bushes proved Alnus incarta very sensitive for the hormone applications. The other deciduous trees and bushes have been only a little damaged in the triale and the coniferous trees not at all. Among the hormone products experimented with in these trials were the sprays diluted according to directions for use more effective than the corresponding amounts of dusts (200—250 kg/hc). Greater quantities of dust (300--400 kg kg/hc), however, were as effective as the diluted sprays. Most effective were the strong sprays but they damaged also most culture plants. On sand soils was the effect of hormone products quicker and more perfect than on clay soils. The effect of hormone application turned to be quicker in the middle of the summer than in the later part of it. The effect of the hormone products was obviously better upon plants in the later stage of development, the test series having been organized in the middle and later part of the summer, the effect of hormone products was apparently worse than it might have been after treatments organized in the early part of the summer.",

    "abstract": "The development of the horses’ pulling power by breeding is disturbed by many factors which render it difficult to substantiate. At the time of registration for, the pedigreebook, the pulling test done by the dynamometer does not present a right picture of every stallions pulling power, as all are not sufficiently well trained for the test. Also the experience of pulling is often slight owing to the lack of work, eventhough the war has improved the situation in this respect. Furthermore faults in caring for and feeding the horse may hinder producing the horses’ full pulling propensity. Besides these different circumstances may effect the results of test performed at various times of the year. Especially the average level of the results in the spring show is erronecously high owing to the test car s tyres slipping on account of the wet ground. The affect of all the above-mentioned inaccuracies can be lessened by using the experimental technique, and the great rise in the experimental results after 1940 is foremost to be put to the merit of the stallions being better accustomed to work, showing that the development has quickly led to even more dependable results. But even if all these experimental faults in technique could be removed the pulling ability of the stallion in the pulling test does still not show its tractive ability because it is the combined results of power and character. The dividing of horses into stepgrades shows that the characteristically deficient horses weed out together with the inexperienced already in the exercise- or walking route or in the first steps. This is confirmed by the manner of weeding out, because horses belonging to the lower stepgrades are not able to start their pull at all; when insted strenght fails those which have reached the higher steps while on the traction stretch with their load. In investigating the inherited pulling power one has, therefore, taken into account from each age group only the stallions who have pulled at least 35 % of their liveweight, as in this way one has been able to weed ont the lower stepgrades’ characteristiccally deficient and untrained horses. The correlation obtained from sires and sons by this procedure is +0.29 ±O.lO. Now the mares’ different pulling reliability was not at all taken into account. In order that the mares dissimilar influence on results could be made the lowest possible, the correlation has also been calculated only from material comprising sons whose dams’ pulling reliability has been valued at 6 points. The correlation then obtained is +0.33±0.11. The final result is harmfully effected by the fact that the correlation is nearest dependent on the stallions who have plenty of offspring. Owing to this, the results have been calculated so that the average of each son has been reckoned and that the correlation between the sires’ and sons’ average. Thus one obtains in the whole material of the sires’ and sons’ correlation +0.37 ±0.15, and from the material comprising sons of 6 point dames +0.46 ±0.15. The sons have been at an average 0.32 steps better than their sires, which foremost is due to them being better trained for the pull. In the pulling results of the sons one can however also notice the influence from the dams, because the sons of 6 point dams have at an average been 0.78 steps better than their sires, and the sons of 5 point dams exactly equal with their sires, and the sons of 0-4 point dams 0.15 steps poorer than their sires. The comparison of the average of all the stallions shows that the sons of the best stallions have most obviously exceeded the midlevel and from the point of view of development of pulling power the best results have been gained when more powerful stallions have been used in breeding with dams most reliable in pulling. In order to gain even better results in the development of horses’ pulling power, the excercising for test should be made even more effective than previously. To lessen the technical test faults the spring shows should be given up and even in summer when the ground is wet, the slipping of car tyres should be prevented by snow-chains. The testing of dams’ pulling power should be developed similarly to that of the stallions. The pedigree book demands should follow the rapid progress which has been noticed in recent years in the pulling tests thanks to better training.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is briefly to examine the influence that the distance to the fields has on the profitableness on 91 farms of size class III (from 25 to 50 of converted field), wich during 1934 —1939 were reviewed by the Board of Agriculture. The farms are grouped, according to the average distance to the fields, in 3 groups: A, average distance under 600 meters; B, average distance from 600 to 1 000 m. and C, average distance over 1 000 m. Further they are grouped according to size into group I from 25 to 37,5 converted field hectares and group II from 37,5 to 50 converted field hectares. The research shows that the net profit and percentage of profitableness diminish considerably when the average distance to the fields increases (tables 4 and 5) and that the decrease is much steeper in connection with changes in small distance groups than with respect to similar changes in higher distance brackets. But the expenditure of work, on the other side, does not notably increase and the management costs do in fact diminish when the distance increases. This is a result of a considerable lowering in the intensity of the field and the overall cultivation of the farm as the location of the fields becomes less favourable. The diminution of the net profit is a consequence of the decrease in total yields. The earlier method of taking the loss of time caused by the location of fields into calculations on different crops and to make the deductions as to the influence of the distance to the fields on the profitableness of farming directly from these calculations, is therefore not in harmony with practical facts.",

    "abstract": "This paper is based partly on the storing1 experiments carried out by the Department of Plan Pathology in 1931—1938, partly on the circulars sent to farmers by the Dept, in 1938, partly on earliee investigations. According to them the damage of stored potato on account of fungous diseases in Fin land is estimated at about 10 per cent of the total weight. The most serious potato disease during the storing time in Finland is the potato blight (Phytophthora infestans). About 70—90 per cent of sick, stored potato will have this disease as primary cause of rotting. The rest, 10—30 per cent, becomes decayed by bacterial diseases. The Fusarium-fungi on the contrary, isolated from stored potato, occur principally as saprophytes. Of that nature an Fusarium solani (MART.) APP. & WR., Fusarium sambucinum FUCH., Fusarium merismoides CORD/ and Fusarium avenaceuni (FRIES) SACC. Only the Fusarium coeruleum (LIBB.) SACC. is established as a parasitic fungus in a few cases, having no noticeable importance in the country. Likewise a number of saprophytic Cylindrocarpon-species (C. Ehrenbergi WR., C. Magnusianun WR., C. olidum WR. and C. radicicola WR.) occur on stored potato tubers. All the potato storing trials in Finland indicate that the keeping qualities of the potato varieties most susceptile to blight are quite insatisfactory. Therefore, the potato blight control which can be realized suitably by cultivation of the best resistant varieties is one of the most effective ways to prevent storing losses. The chemical preserving substances (Conservos and Karsan, p. 95) have not had any noticeable effect on the injurious storage diseases, blight and bacterial rot. Only the occurrence and development of some epiphytical fungi has been prevented by the use of those chemicals. 1 The potato in Finland is generally stored in root cellars and in pits.",

During bisection of morulae, the presence of cytochalasin B decreased the proportion of lysed cells in both the absence (P=0.0001) and presence of sucrose (P=0.001). During bisection of blastocysts the average proportion of lysed cells was slightly lower in the presence of cytochalasin than that in the control medium, but the effect was not statistically significant (P=0.34). No effect of sucrose was observed in either demi-morulae or demi-blastocysts. These results are essentially similar to those obtained in simultaneous experiments with cattle embryos, suggesting that the simpler mouse model might be useful for developing less traumatic bisection protocols for cattle embryos.",

A total of 160 pigs were divided into four groups of 40 animals. Four pigs of the same sex were placed in each pen and fed one of the four experimental diets; a barley-soyabean meal (SBM) control diet (167 g crude protein (CP) /kg dry matter (DM) and 7.6 g lysine/feed unit (FU)) or three similar barley-WDS diets (204 g CP/kg DM) which were supplemented with synthetic lysine to contain 7.7, 9.2 or 10.7 g lysine/FU. Lysine supplementation linearly improved the daily weight gain (DG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the pigs during growing (1-5 weeks) (p &lt; 0.001), finishing (6th week onward) (p &lt; 0.001) and the whole experimental period (p &lt; 0.001).

The extraction of juice averaged 33 % of the fresh weight, and the extraction ratios of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) were 10.5 % and 2.9 %. The percentages of juice DM, CP and TP (true protein) separated in LPC were 6 %, 21 % and 48 %, respectively.

Removal of nutrients from the leaves was low and there were only minor differences in composition between the pressed pulp and the leaves. The leaf juice contained 8.3 % DM, of which 20.9 % was ash, 4.9 % CP, 1.9 % TP and 43.2 % sugars. The LPC had an average DM content of 19.6 %, CP being 21.4 % and TP 19.5 % of DM. The in vitro digestibility and pepsin-HCI-solubility of the protein were low. The mean tannin content of the LPC averaged 3.6 % of DM. The mean lysine and methionine contents of the LPC were low, 3.3 and 1.5 g/16 g N, respectively. The preservation of the leaf juice was satisfactory even without addition of preservative. Preservation of wet LPC was good with additives used at the 1.0 % v/w level. Leaf protein extraction was low and the nutritive value of LPC was not particularly high. This may have been partly due to the late date of harvesting and to the fact that the leaves were frozen for storage.",

    "abstract": "In an extensive investigation concerning the utilization of dandelion, the feasibility of cultivating the dandelion for salad use has been studied. Properties making up the intrinsic quality, viz., nutritive value and content of nitrates, have been used as one criterion of suitability. The study material consisted of 11 Finnish agamospecies selected for their mild taste, and two middle-European cultivars, ’Vollherziger verbesserter’ and ’Vert de Montmagny’. The effects of cultivation methods were also studied: two levels of fertilization, and covering with black polyethelene film, black fibre cloth and bark humus layers of various thicknesses were compared. As criteria of the nutritive value, dry matter, soluble solids, mineral contents, in particular Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn, and vitamin C, were measured. The nitrate content as a criterion of intrinsic quality was also studied. In spring, the dry matter of the rosettes averaged 12.3%, in late summer 17.1 %. In spring the average content of soluble solids was 5.5 %, the mineral content 1.6 %. The amounts of the individually analyzed minerals Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn deviated somewhat from values in the literature, probably due to the methods of cultivation. The amount of vitamin C in spring was on average 42 mg/100g, varying between 29 and 53 mg/100g. The nitrate content was low: at highest 660 mg NO3/kg fresh weight. The influence of fertilizing level was slight. Even the levels of minerals and nitrates were not increased at the higher level of fertilization. Coverings had clear-cut effects. Where the covering effectively eliminated light, i.e. when black film, black fibre cloth or thick bark humus layer was used, the dry matter, soluble solids, mineral content and vitamin C values were decreased and the nitrate values increased. Compared with other plants used as salad greens, the nutritive value and particularly the amount of vitamin C in dandelion are much higher, although the values are considerably decreased if the leaves are bleached. If the mild tasting types studied here were cultivated, bleaching would not be necessary. The nitrate content in dandelion is generally low as compared with many other plants used as salad greens.",

Changes in soil properties induced by various liming agents were investigated in an analogous incubation test, and the results served to interpret the observations made in the pot experiment. When the liming materials were added in equal quantities, their ability to reduce soil acidity decreased in the sequence: calcite &gt; dolomite &gt; basic slag &gt; peat ash. However, their growth-promoting effect appeared only in the second year and was not related to the neutralizing ability. In the muddy fine sand soil (3.0 % of org. C) poor in water-soluble P, the peat ash and basic slag were equally effective as calcite in increasing the dry matter yields. In the fine sand soil (6.4 % of org. C), the basic slag and dolomite significantly increased the second yield. The efficiency of peat ash and basic slag seemed to be attributable to their positive impact on P resources. In fact, peat ash served as a slowly acting P-fertilizer rather than as a liming agent. In the basic slag treatment, an increased silicate concentration obviously resulted in desorption of P. In the P-deficient muddy fine sand, the peat ash was equivalent to calcite in intensifying the P uptake. On the other hand, in the fine sand soil where the polymerization of Al due to an increased pH obviously resulted in enhanced P retention, the P uptake was higher in the soils treated with peat ash and basic slag than in those amended with conventional liming agents.",

The animals were kept indoors and the reproduction system was three lambings in two years, with matings in February, June and October. Oestruses were synchronized without using PMSG so as to group lambings. As a whole, the adaptation of R was better than that of F owing to a higher incidence of pneumonic problems in this breed (36 % vs 81 % mortality between 7 and 150 days of age and 31 % vs 45 % mortality in adult ewes were caused by pneumonia).

Many of the clones registered as L. tatarica proved to be hybrids; these hybrids were, however, often as valuable as ornamentals as L. tatarica. L. tatarica proved variable and susceptible to pests and pathogens, and it also seemed to hybridize readily with other species. Because of these facts clonal selection of L. tatarica clones in cultivation is justified.

The grass was cut twice a year and the contents of nitrogen, potassium, calcium and magnesium in yields were determined. The soils were tested at the beginning and at the end of the trials. On four peat soils the yields over two years without potassium dressings were 34 to 66 % of the respective yields with adequate potassium fertilization. On humus soil the relative yield without potassium was 81 % and on fine sand soil 76 %. On two finesand tills rich inorganic matter the responce of timothy to potassium was 5 %. No significant yield response was obtained on silty clay. In accordance to the depletion of available soil reserves, the differences between the potassium rates increased with time. In average on the six most responsive soils the relative yields without potassium fertilization for the first four successive cuts were 88, 75, 58 and 45 %. For maximum yields, 60 to 80 kg/ ha potassium per cut was required on the organogenic soils and on the finesand, 20 kg/ha was enough on the other three mineral soils. The potassium contents of plants increased greatly, and the contents of nitrogen, calcium and magnesium decreased with increasing potassium fertilization rate. The magnesium content of grass rose to an unusually high level with severe potassium deficiencies. At the end of the trials the soils were quite exhausted of potassium, the subsurface layers being most exhausted. The critical plant potassium content varied from under 2 % to over 3 %. As the large variation was coupled with plant nitrogen, plant K/N ratio was a better indicator for potassium status of ley than plant K. Yield was likely to begin degreasing when the K/N ratio decreased under 1.",

The plants grow too luxuriantly, the root collars remain thin and flowering is delayed. To investigate the impact of the growing method, an experiment with different sources of supplementary light and different substrates was arranged in spring 1987. The following Elatior begonia cultivars were studied: ’Afrodite’, ’Afrodite Special’,'Afrodite Rosa’, ’Mandela’, ’Barbara’, ’Connie’, ’Marja’ and ’Sirene’. Four different lamp types were used: high pressure sodium lamps (Airam SNaKd 330 W), high-pressure mercury lamps (Airam HgLX 400W), high-pressure metal halide lamps (Philips HPI/T 375 W) and, as a control treatment, incandescent lamps of 100W. The plants were potted in B2-peat (Sphagnum peat with moderate fertilization and medium sieving grade), B2-peat (3 parts) plus perlite (1 part) or B2-peat (2 parts) plus perlite (2 parts). The plants lighted with SNaKd or HgLX lamps were the highest, the broadest and the first to reach anthesis and the sale stage. The plants in the control group were the smallest and the last to reach anthesis and the sale stage. The effect of the substrate on the time required to reach anthesis and the sale stage was clear only in the cultivar ’Afrodite Special’; when potted in peat-perlite 2 + 2, its plants flowered 2 weeks later than in other substrate mixtures. The height and the width of the plants were not greatly affected by the substrate. None of the lamp types or substrates clearly increased the number of flower buds or the diameter of the root collar. The proportion of saleable plants varied with the cultivar, lighting and substrate. In most cultivars it was below 50 %. The chief factors reducing saleability were luxuriant growth, weak flowering and oblique growth habit.",

    "abstract": "Data, consisting of a total of 400542 first lactation records completed in 1975 through 1982, were utilised for development of a model for ranking sires. Using the principle of direct sire comparison method(BLUP), sire evaluations were calculated assuming three models. Model 1 included random terms for sires and maternal grandsires (MGS) of cows, fixed sire and MGS groups within the three breeds and fixed two-year classes within herds. A two-year period within a herd was used to increase the number of records in a class. In model 2 genetic groups were only for breeds. Model 3 included fixed breed groups and herd-year classes. Relationships among bulls were used in all models. About 83, 13 and 2 % of cows making the records were of the Finnish Ayrshire (FAy), the Finnish Friesian (FFr) and the Finncattle (Fc), respectively, while about 2 % were of various crossbreds. About 20 % of the herd-year classes had cows of more than one breed. Practically all of the male ancestors of bulls and about 70 to 85 % of maternal grandsires of cows were identified in recent years. About 7 % of the total variation for fat corrected 305-day milk (FCM) production was accounted for by years within herds. The fraction of records lost in editing was 4 % for models 1 and 2, and 11 %for model 3. Assuming model 3, the average numbers of daughters for bulls of the FAy-, FFr- and Fc-breeds were 130, 152 and 44, respectively. Average number of records in a herd-year class was about 3.6 in recent years. The additive genetic superiority of the FAy-breed in FCM-production to the FFr- and Fc-breeds was 84 and 860kg, respectively. Joint use of bull groups and relationships among males (model 1) tended to underevaluate the youngest bulls and overevaluate the oldest bulls belonging to previous generations. Based on the results and the breeding structure in theFinnish dairy cattle population, model 3 was chosen to be used in official sire evaluation.",

Only self-sufficiency of fruits and vegetables is below 100 % due to the climate. Self-sufficiency of energy, protein and fat of the diet is also examined in this article. A new indicator of total self-sufficiency is developed by dividing the total yield measured in feed units with the total feed requirement of total human consumption, measured also in feed units. According to these calculations total self-sufficiency has been from 105 % to 130%, depending on the quantity of total yield. Itis difficult to make adequate calculations of self-sufficiency of inputs, since the industry producing agricultural inputs is operating under free trade, and tries to benefit from foreign trade. Imports of energy, raw materials, machines and implements lower self-sufficiency. Some estimates are, however, given in the text. The article also discusses the attempts to improve food security by storage. Agricultural research aims to clarify how alternative cultivation methods could lessen the dependence on imports, and thus improve the food security.",

Land allocation equations are estimated jointly with the demand of purchased feeds and the supply for milk. The model is used to test how agricultural policy reforms have changed land allocation, animal feeding, and the supply for milk on Finnish dairy-farms. The results suggest that land allocations respond inelastically to the changes in income subsidies paid through the land areas. The use of feed concentrates in milk cows' diet has increased mainly because feed concentrate prices have decreased, rather than through the effects of acreage-based income subsidies on land allocations. At the same time, feed grain production has decreased. Farm size has an important effect on dairy-farm land use. Farmers, who have expanded milk production, have specialised in roughage production. The diet of cows has been intensified by purchasing more feed concentrates. The results also suggest that tradable milk quotas have allowed for a significant re-allocation of milk output between farms. The milk output turned out to be endogenous over the period of tradable milk quotas (1994-1997).;",

    "abstract": "In 1967 and 1968, in the month of June, irrigation of silty clay soil in southern Finland by a single sprinkling, which involved the application of 30 mm of water, increased the yields of spring wheat by an average of between 880 and 970 kg per ha, or 37—51 %, and the yields of barley by 1140—1340 kg per ha, or 37—42 %. Repeating the irrigation after about one week further increased the wheat yields on the average by from 670 to 800 kg per ha and the barley yields between 810 and 860 kg per ha. The effect of the irrigation on the size of the yields was virtually of the same magnitude both years in spite of the fact that in 1967 both June and July were extremely dry months, whereas in 1968 the dry June was followed by a rainy July. The sprinkling affected the ripening of the grain, on the other hand, differently each year: slightly retarding the ripening in 1967 but considerably hastening it in 1968. In the latter year, the irrigation prevented detrimental late tillering and thereby augmented the hectoliter weight and 1000-grain weight of the crops. In response to the one-time sprinkling, the protein content of the grains decreased in the case of the wheat by an average of 1.0—1.3 and of the barley by 0.1—0.7 %-units. The effect of two sprinklings was corresponding decreases of 1.9—3.1 and 0.8—1.0 %-units. The application to the seedlings as surface dressing immediately before irrigation of calcium nitrate containing 60 kg/ha of nitrogen increased the protein content of the wheat on the average by 1.6 and of the barley by 1.9 %-units. The nitrogen fertilization thus prevented excessive lowering of the protein content by irrigation and, furthermore, considerably intensified the salutary effect of the irrigation in augmenting the yield. A disadvantage of abundant nitrogen fertilization was a slight retardation of ripening. The placement of basal dressing with a fertilizer drill at a depth of 9 cm proved effective, particularly in 1967, when both the wheat and the barley yields increased 22 per cent in comparison with the effect of surface dressing. Use of the fertilizer drill, moreover, promoted the ripening process. Sprinkling did not appear to reduce the placement effect of the fertilizer; rather did these two methods form an exceedingly favorable combination.",

    "abstract": "Two Finnish alsike clover varieties, diploid Tammisto and tetraploid Iso, were grown for seed at different locations in the USA for several successive generations. The seed lots were tested in single-plant and forage production trials in Finland to reveal possible varietal changes caused by producing seed in foreign environments. Many of the Tammisto alsike lots produced in the USA had more early-type plants than the Finnish basic seed. In contrast the USA grown Iso lots which differed from the basic seed had lower average growth type indices and fewer flowering plants. Increase in earliness was supposed to result from efficient pollination during early, sparse flowering, decrease in earliness from the fact that alsike clover is a species especially prone to shedding its seeds as soon as they mature. In spaced-plant tests many of the USA lots produced progenies with less winterhardiness than those from the basic seed lot. The poorest overwintering was recorded for the lots from the southern locations. There were no appreciable differences between the four production localities in the United States in terms of other characteristics of the two varieties. – With successive generations of increase no progressive varietal changes were found to occur. Seed lots harvested from the same plot for two or more years did not differ from each other. Forage yield trials comparing the most advanced generation seed lots from the USA with basic seed did not reveal any consistently significant differences.",

Kokeessa olivat lajikkeet Bintje ja Realta, jotka viljeltiin kahdella eri kasvupaikalla, Mikkelissä ja Vehkalahdella, yhdeksällä eri lannoitustasolla. Mikkelissä oli maanlaatu multava hietamaa ja Vehkalahdella hietainen urpasavi. Kenttäkokeessa käytetty typpilannoitus oli 50, 125 ja 200 kg N/ha kukin yhdistettynä kolmeen eri kalilannoitustasoon: 100, 200 ja 400 kg K2O/ha. Laadun arvostelemiseksi määritettiin keskimääräinen ominaispaino ja suoritettiin ominaispainolajitellusta materiaalista maun ja jauhoisuuden arvostelu. Näiden perusteella laskettiin moitteettoman ruokaperunan osuus eri koejäsenissä. Kullekin lannoitustasolle ominainen maku ja jauhoisuus arvosteltiin painomäärältään suurimman ominaispainoluokan perusteella. Lisäksi tutkittiin lannoituksen vaikutus keiton jälkeiseen tummumiseen ja värin säilymiseen kuorittuna. Typpi- ja kalilannoituksen lisääminen alensi perunan ominaispainoa, mikä ilmeni perunan laadussa ominaisjauhoisuuden ja maun huononemisena ja moitteettoman ruokaperunan määrän pienenemisenä. Laadultaan parasta perunaa saatiin molemmista lajikkeista molemmilta kasvupaikoilta pienimmällä typpilannoituksella (50 kg N/ha). Kasvupaikalla oli kuitenkin suurempi vaikutus perunan laatuun kuin lannoituksella. Keiton jälkeistä tummumista oli vähiten pienimmällä typpilannoituksella (50 kg N/ha) kalimäärästä riippumatta. Typpilannoitusta lisättäessä tummumistaipumus kasvoi, mutta suuret kalimäärät estivät tummumisen. Kuoritun perunan säilyvyyteen ei lannoitus vaikuttanut tarkastuksen tapahtuessa 1 vrk:n välein.",

Jauhosavikka ja kaura kehittyivät huomattavasti nopeammin 24° kuin 12° C:ssa. Kumpikin laji tarvitsi 24° C:ssa alkukehitykseensä samat lämpötilasummat 2-lehtiasteelle saakka. Siitä eteenpäin kehittyäkseen jauhosavikka tarvitsi pienemmät lämpötilasummat kuin kaura. Lämpötilan ollessa 12° C kauran alkukehitykseen 2-lehtiasteelle saakka riitti pienempi lämpötilasumma kuin jauhosavikalle. Alhainen lämpötila hidasti enemmän jauhosavikan kuin kauran painon nousua. 2. Lajinsisäisen ja kauran kanssa tapahtuneen kilpailun vaikutuksessa jauhosavikan yksilönpainoon ei ilmennyt eroja. Kilpailu jauhosavikan kanssa pienensi kauran yksilönpainoa ja kokonaissatoa. 3. Jauhosavikan ja kauran puhtaat kasvustot tuottivat pinta-alayksiköltä lähes yhtäsuuret kuiva-ainesadot kuin näiden sekakasvusto. Jauhosavikan sato sekakasvustossa jäi pienemmäksi kuin kauran käsittäen keskimäärin 22.6 % kokonaissadosta. Koe II. Poutajakson vaikutusta keskenään kilpailevaan jauhosavikkaan ja vehnään selvittäneet tutkimukset osoittivat seuraavaa: 4. Poutajakso ei vaikuttanut jauhosavikkaan, mutta alensi vehnän yksilönpainoa ja kokonaissatoa sekä jauhosavikan ja vehnän sekakasvuston satoa. Vehnäsato pieneni voimakkaimmin, kun poutakausi sattui vehnän ollessa orasasteella. 5. Kilpailu jauhosavikan kanssa alensi vehnän yksilönpainoa ja kokonaissatoa. Jauhosavikan yksilönpainoa pienensi lajinsisäinen kilpailu enemmän kuin kilpailu vehnän kanssa. Jauhosavikan yksilönpaino lisääntyi kasvuaikana suhteellisesti enemmän kuin vehnän. Sen painonlisäys yksilöä kohti oli suurempi, vehnän taas pienempi seka- kuin puhtaassa kasvustossa. 6. Puhdas jauhosavikkakasvusto tuotti pienimmän ja vehnäkasvusto suurimman sadon pinta-alayksiköltä. Sekakasvuston sadosta jauhosavikan osuus oli keskimäärin 65.3 % ja vehnän 34.7 %. Vehnään nähden korkeampi valtauskerroin osoitti jauhosavikan tätä voimakkaammaksi kilpailijaksi.",

Sampling at four stages during the growth shows an influence on relative GM quantification based on haploid genome equivalents, due to the specific maize seed composition and differences in DNA extractability from different seed tissues. During plant growth, plant parts with potential GM genes (embryo in kernel and cob on total plant) increase in importance on weight and DNA concentration level, while the endosperm drops in relative importance.

Suhteellinen kosteus oh varastopaikoissa keskimäärin vastaavasti 68—85 %, 82—96 %, ja 93—98 %; lämpötila vaihteli 4.3—1.9°C (taul. 1). Koelajikkeista säilyivät parhaiten Åkerö, Antonovka ja Linda. Näissä lajikkeissa, joista viimeksi mainittu oli kokeiltavana vain yhdessä paikassa, olivat tautien vahingoilta säilyneet hedelmät käyttökelpoisia vielä viimeisessä, huhtikuun loppupuolella tapahtuneessa tarkastuksessa. Wealthy oli jo maaliskuun alussa ylikypsymisen vuoksi käyttökelvoton, samoin Lobo. Punainen kaneli oli jo marraskuussa ylikypsymisen vuoksi miltei käyttökelvoton. Koeaineistossa todetuista taudeista oli pääasiallinen omenien turmelija hedelmän varastolaikku (Gloeosporium sp.). Tautia esiintyi jo maaliskuun ja varsinkin huhtikuun tarkastuksessa niin runsaasti, että se oli ratkaisevasti hedelmien paikassa (ilman suht. kosteus 93—98 %) ja kaikissa säilytyspaikoissa Wealthy-lajikkeessa. Omenissa oli jonkin verran viherhometta (Penicillium sp.), hieman hedelmän muumiotautia (Sclerotinia fructigena Stonem. &amp; Aderh.) ja pieni osa omenista oli kokonaan tai suureksi osaksi ruskettunut (mädäntynyt), johon syytä ei tarkemmin määritetty. Åkerö-lajikkeessa oli tuppilohometta [Fusarium sp., määrityksen mukaan F. avenaceum (Fries) Sacc.] Fysiogenisista taudeista todettiin hedelmien kuoripoltetta (engl. scald) ja Jonathan-laikkuja (engl. Jonathan spot). Näiden merkitys oli verraten vähäinen; edellämainittua alkoi esiintyä varsinkin silloin kun hedelmät olivat olleet huonelämmössä ja viimeksimainittua pääasiallisesti vain ylikypsyneissä tai pilaantuneissa omenissa. Omenien painotappio oli suurin, keskim. 20 % kuivimmassa varastossa (ilman suht. kosteus 75—85 %), jossa hedelmät alkoivat nahistua jo tammikuusta lähtien. Kosteimmassa säilytyspaikassa (ilman suht. kosteus 93—98 %) oli painotappio n. 10 % eivätkä hedelmät tällöin vielä laisinkaan nahistuneet.",

Maidon dehydroaskorbiinihappopitoisuus määritettiin pelkistämällä dehydroaskorbiinihappo titrimetrisesti määritettäväksi askorbiinihapoksi Escherichia colin lepäävien solujen suspensiolla. Tähän menetelmään erikseen kohdistetussa kokeissa todettiin maksimaalisen pelkistymistuloksen riippuvan seuraavista tekijöistä: 1. Bakteerikannasta. Kaikki E. coli-kannat eivät pelkistä dehydroaskorbiinihappoa. 2. Solususpension valmistamiseen käytetyn viljelmän iästä. Ko. viljelmän pitää olla 24 tunnin ikäinen tai sitä nuorempi. 3. Solususpension iästä. Viikkoa kauemmin säilytettyä solususpensiota ei ole tarkoituksenmukaista käyttää. 4. Koeliuoksen pH:sta. Dehydroaskorbiinihapon pelkistymisen pH-optimi on 5.9—6.0. 5. Koeliuoksen kokoomuksesta. Koeliuoksen pitää sisältää käytettävälle bakteerikannalle käyttökelpoista hiilihydraattia. Koetulokset vhttaavat siihen, että sokerin käyminen on ratkaiseva edellytys dehydroaskorbiinihapon pelkistymiselle. Koeliuoksen (ja maidon) kupari- ja rautapitoisuus vaikuttaa myös pelkistymistulokseen. Jo 1.5 μg Cu/ml hidastaa pelkistymistä. Raudan vaikutus on huomattavasti vähäisempi, mutta rauta lisää kuparin vaikutusta. 6. Pelkistämisajan pituudesta. Optimaalinen pelkistämisaika on 20 minuuttia. Pidempi aika johtaa muodostuneen askorbiinihapon uudelleen hapettumiseen. —- 7. Solujen aktiivisuudesta pelkistämisen alkaessa.

Solususpension aktiivisuuden säilymisen, koeliuoksen kokoomuksen ja esi-inkuboinnin välttämättömyyden suhteen tulokset kuitenkin poikkesivat aikaisemmin saaduista. Kuparin ja raudan vaikutuksesta bakteerien aiheuttamaan dehydroaskorbiinihapon pelkistymiseen ei kirjallisuudessa esiinny tietoja. Vastalypsetyssä maidossa on C-vitamiini käytännöllisesti katsoen kvantitatiivisesti askorbiinihappomuodossa. Tämä havainto vahvistaa aikaisempien tutkijoiden esittämiä tietoja. Tutkittaessa valon vaikutusta askorbiinihapon ja dehydroaskorbiinihapon määriin maidossa todettiin varjostetun päivänvalon aiheuttavan pääasiassa askorbiinihapon hapettumista dehydroaskorbiinihapoksi, kokonais-C-vitamiinipitoisuuden säilyessä lähes muuttumattomana. Dehydroaskorbiinihappo on siis näissä olosuhteissa sangen pysyvä. Ruskea lasi hidastaa askorbiinihapon hapettumista. Suorassa auringonvalossa tuhoutuu myös dehydroaskorbiinihappo nopeasti joskin ruskea lasi hidastaa jonkin verran tätäkin tapahtumaa. Ilman sekoittaminen maitoon (säilytysastian ravistaminen) kiihdyttää jonkin verran askorbiinihapon hapettumista, mutta ei suljetussa astiassa vaikuta sanottavasti kokonais-C-vitamiinipitoisuuteen. Kauppamaidon kokonais-C-vitamiinipitoisuus todettiin suunnilleen samaksi kaikkina vuodenaikoina. Askorbiinihappopitoisuus on sen sijaan kesällä huomattavasti alhaisempi kuin syksyllä ja talvella. Säilytettäessä kauppamaitoa 0°:ssa todettiin huomattavaa askorbiinihapon hapettumista. Dehydroaskorbiinihappo todettiin sen sijaan tässä lämpötilassa melko pysyväksi. 18°:ssa suurin osa dehydroaskorbiinihaposta tuhoutuu, mutta askorbiinihappohäviöt ovat vähäiset. Maidon käsittely ja säilytys meijerissä ei aiheuta varsinaisia C-vitamiinitappioita, mutta askorbiinihapon hapettumista dehydroaskorbiinihapoksi tapahtuu vähäisessä määrässä.",

    "abstract": "Edellä on Suomen maatalouden kannattavuustutkimuksissa mukana olevilta kirjanpitoviljelmiltä kerätyn aineiston perusteella tutkittu viljelmien taloutta koskevien tärkeimpien tuloslukujen vaihtelua. Pääosa tutkimuksesta on kohdistunut tilivuoteen 1949—50, jolloin tutkittavia viljelmiä oh kaikkiaan 772. Lisäksi on joissakin tapauksissa käytetty tilivuosia 1934—39 ja 1947—49 koskevaa aineistoa. Tutkimuksen kohteena ovat olleet maatalousomaisuudessa, työnmenekissä, satotuloksissa, rahatuloissa ja -menoissa, kokonaistuotossa, liikekustannuksessa sekä erikseen tärkeimmissä tuotto- ja kustannuserissä ja liikeylijäämässä eri viljelmien välillä ilmenevät vaihtelut. Liikeylijäämän osalta on lisäksi selvitetty keskiarvojen sekä eri vuosien keskimääräisissä liikeylijäämissä havaittavien eroavaisuuksien tilastollista luotettavuutta. Tutkimuksen tulosten perusteella voidaan todeta: 1. Kaikkien tutkittujen tuloslukujen vaihteluväli on osoittautunut verraten suureksi. Useimmissa tapauksissa on suurimman ja pienimmän muuttujan arvon erotus ollut monin verroin suurempi kuin itse keskiarvo. 2. Vaihteluväli on yleensä ollut pienempi ja eri viljelmien tulosten keskittyminen keskiarvon ympärille suurempi niissä tapauksissa, joissa koko viljelmää koskevat luvut (liikeylijäämää lukuun ottamatta) ovat olleet kysymyksessä. Etelä-Suomen alueen 321 kirjanpitoviljelmästä tilivuonna 1949—50 on eri viljelmäsuuruusluokissa ollut 20—51 % sellaisia, joilla maatalousomaisuuden kirjanpitoarvo (muumi, ha kohden) on poikennut enemmän kuin 20% suuruusluokkansa keskiarvosta. Vastaavasti on viljelmistä ollut kokonaistuoton ollessa kysymyksessä 27—45 %, liikekustannuksen 35—48 %, työnmenekin 38—47 % ja keskimääräisten ry-satojen ollessa kysymyksessä 27 —35 % sellaisia, joilla ko. tulosluku on poikennut enemmän kuin 20 % suuruusluokkansa keskiarvosta. Kun kysymyksessä on ollut yksityistä tuotannon haaraa tai yleensä vain osaa viljelmän taloudesta koskevat tulosluvut, on sellaisia viljelmiä, joilla ko. tulosluku on poikennut yli 20 % viljelmäsuuruusluokan keskiarvosta, ollut yleensä edellä mainittua enemmän. 3. Kokonaistuoton, liikekustannuksen ja sikataloustuoton jakautumat, joita esillä olevassa tutkimuksessa on tarkasteltu, ovat olleet vinoja siten, että käytännössä tyypillisin tapaus on ollut jonkin verran aritmeettisen keskiarvon alapuolella. Sama koskee todennäköisesti useita muitakin maatalouden tuloslukuja. Aritmeettisten keskiarvojen antama kuva viljelmien taloudesta on siten tavallaan liioitteleva. 4. Niiden tuloslukujen osalta, joihin viljelmän koko vaikuttaa, on ainakin pienemmillä viljelmillä (I ja II suuruusluokassa) osa vaihtelusta aiheutunut siitä, että Suomen maatalouden kannattavuustutkimuksissa käytetyissä viljelmäsuuruusluokissa on luokkaväli liian suuri. 5. Erityisen suuri on ollut taloudellisen tuloksen vaihtelu eri viljelmien välillä. Tutkittujen 321 Etelä-Suomen alueella sijaitsevan viljelmän keskimääräinen liikeylijäämä on tilivuonna 1949—50 ollut 3650 mk muunnettua hehtaaria kohden. Keskiarvon keskivirhe oli vastaavasti ±38O mk ja neliöhajonta 6800 mk. Viljelmistä on vain n. 3 % ollut sellaisia, joilla liikeylijäämä on poikennut enintään 10 % ja n. 8 % sellaisia, joilla liikeylijäämä on poikennut enintään 20 % viljelmäsuuruusluokkansa keskimääräisestä liikeylijäämästä. Viljelmistä on siten ollut yli 90 % sellaisia, joilla liikeylijäämä on ollut yli 20 % keskimääräistä liikeylijäämää pienempi tai suurempi. 6. Jos kirjanpitoviljelmillä tapahtuneiden muutosten voitaisiin katsoa osoittavan muutoksia koko maassa, olisi maatalouden kannattavuustutkimuksessa nykyisin mukana olevien kirjanpitoviljelmien tulosten perusteella tilastollisesti riittävällä varmuudella todettavissa, onko maatalouden kannattavuudessa tapahtunut olennaisia muutoksia. Yksityisten viljelmien kesken ilmenevän huomattavan vaihtelun takia ei kuitenkaan ole tyydyttäviä mahdollisuuksia yleisesti todeta, kuinka suuria muutokset kulloinkin ovat. Niinkin huomattava vaihtelu, joka maatalouden tulosluvuissa edellä esitetyn mukaan on havaittavissa, on itse asiassa täysin luonnollinen ja sen on katsottava olennaisesti liittyvän käytännön olosuhteita edustavaan aineistoon. Jos kirjanpitoviljelmät olisivat nykyistä paremmin koko maan olosuhteita vastaavia, olisi tuloslukujen vaihtelu todennäköisesti vielä suurempi kuin mitä esitetty tutkimus on osoittanut.",

    "abstract": "Käsillä olevassa julkaisussa on esitetty päätulokset niistä sokerijuurikkaan talvehtimiskokeista, jotka on perustettu Suomen Raakasokeritehdas Osakeyhtiön toimesta vuonna 1950 Saloon ja v. 1951 Saloon sekä Jokioisiin, ja joiden kokeiden tarkoituksena on ollut selvitellä, voidaanko Suomessa tuottaa sokerijuurikkaan siementä kasvupaikallaan talvehtineista juurikkaista. Näiden alustavien kokeiden perusteella saadut päätulokset esitetään seuraavassa tiivistetyssä muodossa. Vuosina 1950/51 ja 1951/52 saatujen, tosin vähäisten kokemusten mukaan näyttää siltä, että Lounais-Suomessa on ainakin sääoloiltaan edullisina vuosina mahdollisuuksia tuottaa sokerijuurikkaan siementä kasvupaikallaan talvehtineista juurikkaista, kunhan talvehtimiseen vaikuttavien seikkojen merkitys saadaan riittävästi selvitetyksi. Tärkein viljelyteknillinen tekijä sokerijuurikkaan talvehtimisen varmentamiseksi on ollut oikeaan aikaan suoritettu kylvö. Parhaiten ovat kaikissa neljässä kokeessa talvehtineet juurikkaat, joiden keskimääräinen läpimitta on ollut noin 2 cm. Halkaisijan kasvaessa kolmeen ja neljään cm:iin on talvehtiminen yleensä ollut varsin selvästi huonompi, samoin myös juurikkaan läpimitan jäädessä kovin pieneksi, alle 0.5 cm. Parhaiten talvehtineiden kasvustojen keskimääräiset talvehtimisprosentit ovat vaihdelleet 66—84 %, huonoimmin talvehtineiden kasvustojen 46—66 % (huomioon ottamatta Jokioisten koetta, jossa juurikkaiden läpimitta 1. ja 2. kylvön ruuduissa oli lähinnä harventamisen vuoksi kokonaista 4—7 cm ja jossa harventaminen on saattanut vaikuttaa heikentävästi talvehtimiseen). Kun huonoimmin talvehtineista kasvustoistakaan ei ole tuhoutunut kuin keskimäärin noin tai lähes puolet, niistä on saatu selvästi parempia siemensatoja (n. 2 600—2 700 kg/ha) kuin parhaiten talvehtineista kasvustoista (n. 2 200 kg/ha), joiden talvehtimisprosentti on ollut noin 75. Multaus on jossain määrin parantanut huonoimmin talvehtineiden suurimpien juurikkaiden talvehtimista, mutta alentanut pienimpien juurikkaiden talvehtimisprosenttia. Satotuloksiin multaus sen sijaan on kaikissa tapauksissa, ja nimenomaan pienimpien juurikkaiden kohdalla, vaikuttanut yleensä erittäin haitallisesti siitä huolimatta, että liika maa haravoitiin mullattujen juurikkaiden päältä keväällä ja että ne lannoitettiin salpietarilla. Siemensadon laatu, lähinnä itävyys on ollut v. 1951 varsin tyydyttävä (74— 93 %), v. 1952 sen sijaan poikkeuksellisen epäedullisten sääolojen vuoksi huono (47—60 %, Jokioisissa vain 9—14 %). Sokerijuurikkaan talvehtimiskokeita jatkettaessa on tarkoitus kiinnittää päähuomio niiden seikkojen selvittelyyn, jotka ratkaisevimmin vaikuttavat talvehtimiseen sekä juurikkaista saatavaan siemensatoon ja sen laatuun. Näistä lienevät kylvöaika, kylvömäärä, käytettävä kanta, lannoitus, maan kosteusolot ja kasvukunto yleensä, sekä multaus tärkeimmät.",

However, there have been many arguments over its suitability for the cold regions of the U.S.A, and Europe. Bedding requirement and hay consumption are greater in a loose housing barn than in a stanchion barn. Moreover, it has been claimed that cows will suffer from subzero weather. Visits and interviews at nineteen North Michigan loose housing barn farms proved the last-mentioned argument to be wrong, since cold weather had never caused any trouble. The bedded area must be protected from draught. Wind and wet snow are wores than cold weather. In properly arranged loose housing barns bedding consumption has been 30 to 50 per cent more than in stanchion barns. On some farms the bedding requirement has been three times the amount needed for stanchion barns. Hay consumption has been somewhat more than in a stanchion barn Loose housing barns can be successfully operated in relatively cold regions. Barn arrangement and operation practices determine the degree of success. Where a proper loose housing barn can be constructed and it is properly operated the advantages of the system far outweigh the disadvantages.",

    "abstract": "Edellä on tarkasteltu sivuansiotulojen merkitystä Suomen pienviljelijäväestön taloudessa. Tällöin on pyritty ensin selvittämään, mistä lähteistä pienviljelijät saavat sivuansiotuloja. Sen jälkeen on tutkittu sivuansioista saatujen rahatulojen ja sivuansioiden aiheuttamien rahamenojen sekä rahaylijäämän suuruutta ja rahatulojen sekä rahaylijäämän osuutta koko talouden rahatuloista ja rahaylijäämästä. Vielä on tarkasteltu sivuansioiden antaman bruttotuoton ja bruttotulon suuruutta sekä niiden osuutta koko talouden bruttotuotosta ja bruttotulosta. Tutkimuksen tulosten perusteella voidaan todeta: 1. Sivuansiotulolähteistä olivat tutkittuna aikana tärkeimpiä metsätyöt. Niistä saatujen rahatulojen osuus sivuansioiden rahatulojen kokonaismäärästä vaihteli n. 25 %:sta n. 75 %:iin. - Myös rakennus- ja maataloustöiden sekä erilaisten ammattitöiden merkitys sivuansiotulojen antajana oli tutkimuskaudella verraten tärkeä. 2. Sivuansioista saatujen rahatulojen osuus viljelijäperheiden kokonaisrahatuloista vaihteli n. 17 %:sta Etelä-Suomessa n. 65 %:iin Koillis-Suomessa. - Sivuansioista saadun rahaylijäämän osuus koko talouden rahaylijäämästä vaihteli vastaavasti n. 27 %:sta Etelä-Suomessa n. 99 %:iin Koillis-Suomessa. 3. Sivuansioista saatu bruttotuotto muodosti keskimäärin n. 20 % koko talouden bruttotuotosta vaihdellen n. 12 %:sta Etelä-Suomessa n. 42 %:iin Pohjois-Suomessa. 4. Sivuansioista saatu bruttotulo oli keskimäärin n. 26 % viljelijäperheen bruttotulosta vaihdellen n. 16 %:sta Etelä-Suomessa n. 50 %:iin Pohjois- Suomessa. 5. Pääosa sivuansiotuloista oli työtuloa, palkkaa viljelmän ulkopuolella suoritetusta ihmis- ja hevostyöstä. Sivuansiopääomista saatujen tulojen merkitys oli hyvin vähäinen. 6. Sivuansiotulojen merkitys oli suoritetun tutkimuksen mukaan Pohjois- ja Itä-Suomen pientiloilla huomattavasti suurempi kuin Etelä- ja Länsi- Suomen pientiloilla. 7. Peltoalan kasvaessa sivuansiotulojen merkitys selvästi pieneni. Pienviljelmät, joiden peltoala oli yli 10 ha, eivät tutkimuksen mukaan enää olleet sanottavasti riippuvaisia viljelmän ulkopuolelta saatavista sivuansiotuloista. Tutkimuksen tulokset osoittavat siten, että sivuansiotuloilla oli vv. 1937—1938 varsin tärkeä merkitys Suomen pienviljelijäväestön taloudessa. Kun tärkein sivuansiotulolähde oli metsätyöt, voidaan sanoa, että Suomen pienviljelijäväestön toimeentulo oli ennen toista maailmansotaa ratkaisevasti riippuvainen näistä töistä. Mikäli metsätöitä oli riittävästi, kuten asianlaita oli tutkimuskaudella, saivat metsäseutujen, ensisijassa Itä- ja Pohjois-Suomen, pienviljelijät runsaasti rahatuloja, jopa enemmän perhettä kohden kuin Etelä-Suomen pienviljelijät. Mutta metsätöiden supistuessa joutuivat niistä pääasiallisen toimeentulonsa saaneet pienviljelijät vaikeuksiin. Näin tapahtui 1930-luvun pulavuosina. Niinpä Sipilän tutkimuksen (10, p. 39) mukaan suurin osa eli n. 60 % vv. 1933—36 tapahtuneista maatalojen pakkohuutokaupoista oli Oulun läänin talousseuran, Kuopion, Pohjois- ja Itä-Karjalan sekä Viipurin läänin maanviljelysseurojen alueilla. Näillä alueilla pienviljelijäväestön talous oli ratkaisevassa määrin sivuansiotuloista riippuvainen. Tämä osoittaa, että jos pienviljelijäväestön talous perustuu yksipuolisesti suhdanneherkkiin metsätyötuloihin, mainitun väestön toimeentulo on varsin epävarmoilla perusteilla. Tutkimuskauden jälkeen olosuhteet ovat maassamme muuttuneet. Asutustoiminnan johdosta on muodostunut suuri määrä uusia pientiloja, ja suurten sekä keskikokoisten tilojen luku on vähentynyt. On muodostettu paljon sellaisia tiloja, jotka eivät tule toimeen yksinomaan pellon ja metsän antaman tuoton turvin, vaan joiden asukkaiden on turvauduttava sivuansiotöihin. Kun suurempien ja keskikokoisten tilojen pienviljelijäväestölle tarjoamat sivuansiomahdollisuudet ovat entisestään supistuneet myös Etelä-Suomessa, täytyy pienviljelijäväestön näidenkin töiden osalta saada muita ansiotöitä. Samalla ovat myös metsäalat pienentyneet, joka osaltaan vaikuttaa sivuansiomahdollisuuksia supistavasti. Vastapainona on itsenäisten tilojen luvun lisäytyminen, jotka tarjoavat työtä sellaiselle väestölle, joka aikaisemmin on kokonaisuudessaan saanut toimeentulonsa sivuansiotöistä. Mutta kun otetaan huomioon maaseudun väestön lisäytyminen, voidaan päätellä, että sivu ansiotulojen tarve on tällä hetkellä todennäköisesti vähintään yhtä suuri kuin ennen toista maailmansotaa. Asiasta olisi suoritettava lisätutkimuksia, jotta nykyinen tilanne saataisiin selville ja voitaisiin ryhtyä tarpeellisiin toimenpiteisin. Joka tapauksessa on ilmeistä, että Suomen pienviljelijäväestöstä joutuu suuri osa jatkuvasti turvautumaan erilaisiin sivuansiotöihin. Tämän väestön toimeentulo riippuu siten ratkaisevasti siitä, minkälaisia sivuansioita on saatavissa ja minkälaisen palkan nämä työt voivat pienviljelijäväestölle antaa.",

    "abstract": "Esillä olevassa tutkimuksessa on Maatalouden taloudellisen tutkimuslaitoksen suorittaman tiedustelun perusteella selvitelty karjatonta maataloutta ja sen edellytyksiä- Suomessa. Tiedustelun perusteella voidaan arvioida, että maassamme on 900—1000 yli 5 peltohehtaaria käsittävää karjatonta tai lähes karjatonta viljelmää. Tutkimusaineisto käsittää näistä n. kolmasosan. I viljelmäsuuruusluokassa (pelto- ala 5—9.99 ha) on karjattomia viljelmiä 0.1-0.2 %, II sl:ssa (10—24.99 ha) n. 0.5 %, III sl:ssa (25—49.99 ha) n. 3.5 % ja IV sl:ssa (50 ha tai enemmän) n. 10 % vastaavaan suuruusluokkaan kuuluvien viljelmien koko lukumäärästä. Tutkituista viljelmistä on 80 % siirtynyt karjattomaksi vuosina 1951 52. Karjattomaksi siirtymisen yhteydessä on vähennetty myös muiden viljelmällä pidettyjen kotieläinten määrää sekä erityisesti Etelä-Suomen alueella heinän, juurikas- vien ja useimmissa tapauksissa myös perunan viljelyaloja. Vastaavasti on lisätty viljan, rypsin ja kesannon alaa. Sisä-Suomen, Pohjois-Pohjanmaan ja Koillis-Suomen alueilla ei heinäala kuitenkaan ole vähentynyt, vaan eräissä tapauksissa päinvastoin lisääntynyt karjattomaksi siirtymisen jälkeen. 1 yöntekijöiden lukumäärän vähentyminen karjattomaan talouteen siirryttäessä on Etelä-Suomen alueella 1 viljelmäsuuruusluokkaa lukuun ottamatta ollut suurempi kuin karjataloustyöntekijöiden lukumäärä ennen siirtymistä sekä I ja II suuruusluokkaa lukuun ottamatta suurempi kuin yleisten normilukujen mukaan laskettu työnmenekin vähentyminen olisi edellyttänyt. Traktorien, lypsykoneiden ja leikkuupuimurien lukumäärän perusteella arvioiden ovat karjattomaan talouteen siirtyneet viljelmät olleet pidemmälle koneellistettuja kuin kaikki viljelmät keskimäärin. Leikkuupuimuri tai osuus siihen on tutkituilla Etelä-Suomen alueen viljelmillä kaikissa viljelmäsuuruusluokissa ollut keskimäärin yleisempi kuin lypsy- kone ennen karjattomaksi siirtymistä, joskin osa puimureista lienee mm. saantivaikeuksista johtuen hankittu vasta karjattomaksi siirtymisen jälkeen. Karjattomaksi siirtymisen vaikutusta viljelmien tuottoon ja kustannuksiin on selvitelty vain Etelä-Suomen alueelta, jossa pääosa (70 %) tutkituista viljelmistä sijaitsee. Lähinnä tilivuoden 1952—53 hinta- ja palkkatason perusteella suoritetun laskelman mukaan on kokonaistuotto karjattomaan talouteen siirryttäessä vähentynyt keskimäärin 21 700 (I sh) —7300 (IV sl) mk ha kohden. Samalla ovat myös kustannukset huomattavasti alentuneet. Kun rehuviljan hinta on karjattomaksi siirtymisen tapahtuessa ollut poikkeuksellisen korkea, on siirtymisen silloisten hinta- ja menekkisuhteiden vallitessa katsottava keskimäärin merkinneen viljelmien taloudellisen tuloksen, lähinnä puhtaan tuoton kohoamista. Hintasuhteiden muututtua on taloudellinen tulos tiliv. 1952—53 hintojen mukaan osoittautunut vain suuremmilla viljelmillä (III ja IV sl) olennaisesti paremmaksi kuin mitä viljelmien tuotantosuunta ennen karjattomaksi siirtymistä olisi edellyttänyt. Osa todetuista muu- toksista on kuitenkin ollut sellaisia, että ne on toteutettu tai ainakin voitu toteuttaa karjaa pitävillä viljelmilläkin, joten karjattomaan talouteen siirtyminen sinänsä on vain IV suuruusluokan viljelmillä merkinnyt taloudellisen tuloksen kohoamista, ja niilläkin siksi vähän (1860 mk ha kohden), että sitä laskelmaan liittyvän epätarkkuuden vuoksi on pidettävä varsin epävarmana. Vaikka karjattomaan talouteen siirtymistä on tuotantopoliittiselta kannalta katsoen pidettävä tarkoituksenmukaisena toimenpiteenä niillä alueilla ja niillä viljelmillä, joilla on parhaat edellytykset viljantuotantoon ja yleensä voimakkaaseen kasvinviljelyyn, ovat karjattoman viljelyn taloudelliset edellytykset Suomessa kokonaisuutena katsoen kuitenkin vähäiset. Karjaton maanviljely tulee kysymykseen vain tarkoin harkituissa yksityistapauksissa lähinnä etelä-Suomessa suurilla viljelmillä. Eräissä erikoistapauksissa voidaan karjaloilta taloutta suositella viljelmän koosta ja sijainnista riippumatta.",

In all these experiments no evidence indicated that either of these preparations had accelerated the decomposition of rye straw. This could be established under the less favourable conditions in the field composts without mineral fertilizers as well as under the almost ideal conditions in pot experiments where applications of nitrogen and phosphorus were sufficient to satisfy the needs of a large microbial population. Consequently, according to the results of these experiments there seems to be no reason for using such preparations as »Fertosan» and »QR» in humifying rye straw. The decomposition of organic matter seems to depend more on the nitrogen and perhaps even on the phosphorus supply than on an inoculation of some bacteria or on an application of microbial »activators».",

    "abstract": "At the Department of Horticulture annotations on the yearly crop of a number of different apple varieties. In this paper are given the crop records of certain trees, grafted upon Finnish seedling rootstocks of known origin for periods of 15—21 years from planting time onwards. The general management of all these trees, such as pruning, manuring, etc., has been uniform all the time. Although the material available was rather small, it was established that the seedling rootstocks used have not had any marked influence upon the productivity of the individual trees of one and the same variety. On the contrary, most of the trees have had very uniform total crops if the periods taken into consideration have been sufficiently long. The apple varieties which start to crop rather late, such as Sugar-Miron or Lepaan meloni, may show rather large individual variations during the first years of cropping (the period from 6 to 11 years). Later, when the trees reach full cropping age, the variation begins to diminish. Some early cropping varieties, such as Snygg and Harlamovsky, on the other hand, show a striking uniformity in the yields of the individual trees even during the first period. In general, it may be stated that despite the existence of much variation in the annual cropping of the individual trees, the records of total crops from the same trees for periods of several years remain fairly uniform, as has already been pointed out. Unfortunately it was not possible to make direct comparisons between the trees considered here and others grafted upon clonal rootstocks. Reference may be made, however, to Meurman's (1953) paper on the yield records of certain apple trees upon Mailing rootstocks grown in Finland. The individual trees in trials reported in that paper revealed a very high variability in yield, in spite of the hereditary uniformity of the clonal stocks used. The hardiness of the trees grafted upon Finnish seedling stocks appears to be distinctly better than that of trees upon clonal Mailing stocks in our conditions. Apparently this is one of the main reasons why relatively great variation exists between the cropping records of individual trees grafted on clonal stocks when compared with the greater uniformity of cropping present in trees grafted upon Finnish seedling rootstocks.",

    "abstract": "Viljatuotteiden sisältämän fytiinihapon hajoamista suomalaisessa leivänvalmistuksessa tutkittiin määrittämällä yhteensä 60 kaupallisen tai itse valmistetun leipänäytteen fytiinihappopitoisuus sekä seuraamalla fytiinihapon hajoamista happamen ruisleivän eri valmistusvaiheissa. Ruisleipien fytiinihappopitoisuus oli yleensä sitä pienempi mitä happamempaa leipä oli. Tutkituissa näytteissä oli vähintään 50 % ja parhaimmillaan jopa 98 % fytiinihaposta hajonnut leivän valmistuksen aikana. Valmiiden leipien fytiinihappofosforin määrä vaihteli välillä 5—151 mg/100 g. Kolmivaiheisessa valmistusmenetelmässä hajoaminen tapahtui tehokkaammin kuin kaksivaiheisessa menetelmässä. Näkkileivissä fytiinihapon hajoamisprosentti oli 10—20 % pienempi kuin happamuudeltaan vastaavissa pehmeissä leivissä. Runsaimmin fytiinihappoa sisältäviksi leipätyypeiksi todettiin graham- ja ohrajauhoista valmistetut hiivaleivät. Niiden valmistuksen aikana jauhojen fytiinihaposta hajoaa keskimäärin vain 25—35 %. Valmiiden leipien keskimääräinen fytiinihappofosforipitoisuus oli 120—170 mg/100 g. Viljatuotteiden kulutus Suomessa nykyään on arvioitu keskimäärin 315 g:ksi henkeä ja päivää kohti, josta määrästä noin 100 g on ruista, 50 g kokojyvävehnää, 125 g valkoista vehnäjauhoa ja loput kauraa ja ohraa (15). Jos oletetaan, että ruis ja vehnä nautitaan leipänä ja muu vilja puuroksi valmistettuna, sisältää suomalainen ruoka edellä esitetyistä tuloksista saatujen keskimääräisten fytiinihappofosforipitoisuuksien mukaan laskettuna päivittäin leivässä n. 155 mg ja puurossa n. 75 mg eli yhteensä n. 230 mg fytiinihappofosforia. Olettaen, että fytiinihappo poistuu suolistosta pentakalsiumfytaattina (6), saostaa tämä fytiinihappomäärä n. 240 mg kalsiumia. Mainitut viljatuotteet itse sisältävät 90 mg kalsiumia (19), joten nautittujen viljatuotteiden voidaan laskea riistävän muun ruoan sisältämästä kalsiumista 150 mg eli määrän, joka sisältyy esim. 125 ml:aan maitoa. Ottaen huomioon, että suomalainen ruokavalio sisältää keskimäärin yli 1300 mg (15) kalsiumia henkeä ja päivää kohti, voidaan fytiinihapon sitomaa kalsiumin määrää pitää varsin pienenä. Näin ollen näyttää viljatuotteiden ruokamme kalsiumtaloutta huonontava vaikutus suhteellisen vähäiseltä.",

    "abstract": "Das Untersuchungsmaterial ist in Nord-Savo und Süd-Ostbottnien gesammelt worden in Kleinbetrieben, die am Schafwirtschafts-Wettbewerb des Zentralverbands der Kleinbauern teilgenommen haben. Von jedem der 97 in das Material eingehenden Mutterschafe hat man die Wollproduktionen der Winter-, der Frühjahrs- (die zus. die Stallfütterungszeit bedeuten) und der Sommerzeit (Weidezeit! gewonnen. Die als Winterwolle bezeichnete Wolle ist vom 1. 10.—31. 10 gewachsen, die Frühjahrswolle vom 1. 2.—31. 5. und die Sommerwolle vom 1. 6.—30. 9. Bei den angeführten Zeitangaben ist jedoch ein 10 tägiges Überschreiten gestattet gewesen, ohne dass die Wolle der folgenden Zeitgruppe zugezählt worden wäre. Die Behandlung des Materials ist dieselbe gewesen wie bei der früheren Untersuchung (1). Die durchschnittliche Feinheit der Wolle geht aus Tabelle 1 hervor. Danach sind die Bugwolle sowie die ihr zunächst gewachsene Flanken- und Rückenwolle am dünnsten, während die Schenkelwolle am gröbsten ist. Züchterisch ist es wichtig festzustellen, dass das Material jedoch solche Mutterschafe umfasst hat, deren Wolle an den verschiedenen Körperteilen gleicher Feinheitsklasse gewesen ist. Nach Tabelle 1 ist die Winterwolle am feinsten und die Sommerwolle am gröbsten gewesen, aber die Differenzen der Mittelwerte sind indes so gering, dass sie nicht von nennenswerterer praktischer Bedeutung sind. Zwischen der mittleren Feinheit der Winter- und der der Sommerwolle ist r = +0.284±0.098 gewesen und entsprechend zwischen der Frühjahrs- und der Sommerwolle r = 0.276±0.102. Die angeführten Korrelationen sind in Anbetracht des grossen mittleren Fehlers belanglos. Die wirkliche Wuchszeit der Wolle hat in der Winterzeit durchschnittlich 128.62 ±2.42, im Frühjahr 115.32±2.25 sowie in der Sommerzeit 121.21 ±2.06 Tage gedauert. Der durchschnittliche Wollerttrag hat im Material jährlich 2.44±0.06 kg ausgemacht, während er sich bei den einzelnen Schafen auf 1.4—3.7 kg belaufen hat. Die Wollerzeugung der Sommerzeit hat im Mittel 47.7 ±0.8 % der Jahresproduktion betragen, die der Winterzeit entsprechend 31.5±0.7 % und die des Frühjahrs 21.8±0.8 %. In der Sommerzeit haben die Schafe, auf 100 Tage berechnet, im Mittel 966.8±24.0 g Wolle erzeugt, in der Winterzeit 601.0 ±21.0 g und im Frühjahr 276.6 ±23.0 g. Die schwache Wollprofuktion der zwei letztgenannten Zeiträume beruht, wie sich bei eingehender Betrachtung des Materials gezeigt hat, auf knapper Fütterung sowie vor allem darauf, dass die Schafe während der ganzen Stallfütterungszeit, also etwa 8 Mt, in engen, dunklen, heissen Kuhställen mit einer von Ammoniakdämpfen gesättigten Luft gehalten werden. Nach Tabelle 2 ist die Frühjahrswolle bei allen in der Untersuchung geprüften Proben am kürzesten geblieben, während die Sommerwolle entsprechend die beträchtlichste Länge erlangt. Dies ist wieder eine offensichtliche Folge des Einflusses verschiedenartiger äusserer Bedingungen, der in diesem Falle nicht als praktisch belanglos zu gelten hat. Die mittleren Längen der in einer und derselben Wuchsperiode von den verschiedenen Körperteilen erhaltenen Wollproben dagegen sind nicht sehr voneinander unterschieden gewesen. Als Korrelation zwischen Feinheit und Länge der Wolle hat sich r = ±0.28±0.09 ergeben. Obgleich sie von geringem Zahlenwert ist, gibt sie doch einen Hinweis in der Richtung, dass grobe Wolle etwas länger als feine ist. Dasselbe tritt auch bei den Wollmengen hervor, bei denen die auf Grund des Sommermaterials berechnente Korrelation zwischen Wollfeinheit und -menge 0.45 ± 0.08 betragen hat. Neben der dürftigen Fütterung haben die unzweckmässigen Winterunterkünfte nachteilig auf die Wollerzeugung der Schafe eingewirkt. So haben von den Schafen des Untersuchungsmaterials nur 20 % den Winter in einem eigentlichen Schafstall verbracht, während dagegen 73 % mit den Kühen zusammen im Kuhstall gewesen sind. Dessen heisse und feuchte Luft hat denn auch bei gewissen Tieren einen merklichen Haarausfall und -Verlust verursacht, ja sogar in dem Masse, dass der Wollertrag der Winterzeit nicht mehr als 100 g betragen hat. Die den Wollertrag herabsetzende Wirkung dürftiger Fütterung und unzweckmässiger Pflege ist in gewissen Fällen ferner durch die hohe Lämmerzahl gesteigert worden. Die durchschnittliche Menge der von den Muttertieren des Materials erhaltenen Lämmer hat 2.52 ±0.1 ausgemacht. 23 Mutterschafe haben 3—5 Lämmer geboren, und von diesen sind wenigstens 3 aufgezogen worden. Die durchschnittliche Wollmenge der betreffenden Mütter hat 2.4 kg jährlich und das durchschnittliche Gewicht der Lämmer in einem Alter von 6 Mt 30.6 kg betragen. Ferner haben 3 Mutterschafe des Materials je 4 Lämmer geboren, die aufgezogen worden sind. Die Wollmengen dieser Mütter sind im Jahre und das Gesamtgewicht ihrer Lämmer im Alter von 6 Mt wie folgt gewesen; 2.95 kg Wolle 117 kg Lebendgewicht, 2.35 kg—ll9 kg und 1.90 kg—l2o kg. Diese Ergebnisse sind durch reichliche und vielseitige Winterfütterung sowie nährstoffreiche Weiden erlangt worden, so dass der nachteilige Einfluss der Lämmer auf die Wollerzeugung keine primäre Ursache ist, sondern in erster Linie in ungünstigen äusseren Verhältnissen hervortritt. Bei den untersuchten Schafen ist die Länge der Wolle im Vergleich mit den von der Industrie als Minimalforderung angesetzten 8 cm durchschnittlich zu kurz gewesen. Dabei sind die Schafe 3mal jährlich geschoren worden, so dass man zur Gewinnung längerer Wollfasern in der Schafwirtschaft Finnlands zu zweimaliger Schur im Jahre überzugehen hätte. Diese Massnahme ist mit Rücksicht auf den Wollertrag aber nur dann möglich, wenn die Schafe in kühlen und trockenen Räumen überwintern können oder das ganze Jahr über im Freien bleiben. Die Möglichkeiten, letzteres durchzuführen, sind schon viele Jahre erprobt worden, indem man die Schafe das ganze Jahr über im Freien gehalten hat, wo ihnen nur eine Bretterhütte mit lichtgezimmerten Wänden bei den schlimmsten Regenfällen und Schneestürmen als Unterschlupf gedient hat. In derartigen Verhältnissen haben die Mutterschafe auch gelammt, eines sogar bei einer Kälte von 28° C ohne die geringste Beeinträchtigung. Die in die Versuche einbezogenen Schafe sind gesund und frisch geblieben, ihre Wolle ist rein und von schönem Glanz gewesen, und auch ihr Wollertrag ist durchweg grösser ausgefallen als zuvor, als die Schafe in warmen Unterkünften gewesen waren. Da die Wollerzeugung des finnischen Schafes nach Ansicht der Verfasser am meisten durch Hitze, Feuchtigkeit und Enge der Kuhställe beschränkt wird, hat man, vielleicht abgesehen vom nördlichsten Finnland, die Schafe das ganze Jahr über im Freien aufzuziehen, wie es in den Versuchen geschehen ist. Durch zweckmässige Fütterung der Schafe lässt sich unter den besagten Verhältnissen die wirkliche Wollerzeugungsneigung heraussteilen, und es ist wahrscheinlich, dass statt der jetztigen 2 kg Erzeugung denn auch schon eine durchschnittliche Erzeugung von 3 Wollkilogram in Frage kommen kann.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a method of drawing a curve describing the average growth of grass in pastures on the basis of pasture experiments extending over several years. The starting point is Rappe’s (5) method of drawing a growth curve for one growth period. Where the experimental plots are to be mown, the daily growth of the grass is first calculated for each experimental year separately, as Rappe has described (the yield divided by the number of days passed since the previous mowing). The growth values for the periods between mowings are then put down in the time-table given in Table 2 (p. 187), each year on a different line. For instance, in the year 1951 the dates of mowing were June 20th, July 25th, and September 11th, and the amounts of daily growth 14, 26 and 2 kg per ha of dry matter. The midpoint of each period and the average of the annual growth values for the same period are giwen beneath the table. Thus the midpoint of the period June 10th—June 20th is June 15thand the average of the annual growth values for this period (14 +34 + 36) : 3 = 28 kg per ha of dry matter per day. The values for average growth calculated in this way are then marked in a system of co-ordinates where the time from spring till autumn is on the x axis and the amount of growth on the y axis. The points are joined by straight lines, and the final growth curve is drawn along the line indicated by the midpoints of the lines. This method of drawing the curve aims at modifying the irregularities caused by occasional factors. This method was used in Figure 2 (p. 187), which also gives levels showing the average growth for different periods. The curve of average growth is drawn separately for each member of the experiment, and finally added to the same system of co-ordinates in the way shown in Figure 3 (p. 190). As the space limited by the curve of average growth and the x axis represents the total yield of the growth period, the curve indicates both the amount of yield and the average changes in growth occurring during the growth period. In the case reported, growth is assumed to have begun at the beginning of May in the different years. The curve of average growth for experimental plots grazed with livestock is drawn in a similar way, except that the time representing the periods between different mowings is the period needed for grazing the pasture once and the number of fodder units received by the animals during this period. If, at any time, the animals were not grazing in the pasture, the interval was included in the next period of grazing. The growth period is supposed to have begun when the animals are put out to grass in spring. Figure 4 (p. 191) gives the curves of average growth for an experimental plot grazed with sheep.",

    "abstract": "In the experiments reported above the effect of organic material upon the aggregation of soil particles and the simultaneous immobilization of mineral nitrogen by microorganisms were studied. The relative amount of water-stable aggregates larger than 0.5 mm in diameter was considered to indicate the aggregation state of the soil samples. Probably, somewhat different results were obtained if the crumb formation had been determined by some other method, but it is not sure that these would have been more reliable. Since the incubation of soil samples were performed under aerobic conditions, and all the samples were mineral soils, it seemed justifiable to take the nitrate-nitrogen content of the soil samples to characterize the amount of mineral nitrogen in them. On the basis of the results the general conclusion may be drawn that the more favourable the conditions are for the development of an active and large microflora in the soil, the more intensively the crumb formation and the immobilization of nitrogen takes place, but also the destruction of aggregates begins the more rapidlv. This appeared to be true with regard to the indigenous fertility of soil as well as to the fertilization. Liming, however, did not improve the conditions in these experiment, probably due to the rather slight acidity of the soil samples used. Under otherwise similar conditions the larger amount of straw produced larger amount of aggregates, but the differences in the nitrate-nitrogen content of soil in the presence of various amounts of straw were neglibigle. Generally, the degree of immobilization of soil nitrogen seemed largely to depend on the properties of soil and on other environmental conditions, and nitrogen applications, theoretically enough for the needs of microorganisms that decomposed the straw, could not always prevent an intensive absorption of soil nitrogen. The crumb formation appeared to need mere energy-yielding material than the immobilization of nitrogen, or the destruction of crumbs occurred more rapidly than the nitrification of microbiologically bound nitrogen.",

Current challenges related to climate change, free market, common agricultural policy, food labelling and safety require new knowledge and solutions in farm and policy making levels. Also, global demand for safe and nutritious food and increased demand for animal products in developing countries give opportunities and poses responsibilities for food production in Northern hemisphere especially in boreal region where available water is not a limiting factor for food production. In order to fulfil the national and global demands, the long term goal of the agricultural research in boreal region should be the sustainable intensification of food production. In addition, a better use of by-products and efficient cycling of nutrients in all sectors of food chain is essential in the future.

    "abstract": "According to the agricultural census of 1950 about 124.000 ha., or 5,4 % of the field area, have been deep-drained on farms with more than 2 ha. field. Of this, 50 % are tile drainage, 15 % nailed wooden case or bored wooden pipe drainage, while about 35 % are drained by other methods, which for the most part consist of brush drainage. Only 10 % of the field area is nowadays cultivated without ditches: the total cultivated area drained with open ditches amounts to almost 2.000.000 ha., and the total length of the open ditches to at least 1.600.000 km. About 1.400.000 ha. have been calculated to be in need of deep-drainage and also worth deep-draining. The increasing use of machines in field cultivation has made it urgently necessary to determine the best way to eliminate the disadvantages caused by open ditches. If this work were to be carried out with the present deep-drainage methods, it would take at least 200 years at the present speed, and would cost over 100 milliard marks, calculated according to present prices. However desirable deep-drainage may be, it is hardly possible to realize it with sufficient speed and to its full extent. By using the present methods such an undertaking would exceed the capacity of our agriculture, owing to the great expense involved. Deep-drainage in Finland is generally more expensive than in many other countries. This is not only due to the differences in soil and climate or the high level of prices and wages, but partly also to the special character of our deep-drainage. Thus we use a 30—50 cm. deeper drainage here in Finland than in Sweden, yet the drain distances are almost the same in the two countries. The present methods used in deep-drainage are based partly on the practice that prevailed abroad in the nineteen-twenties, and partly on the belief of the farmers themselves and the deep-drainage experts in the general need for drainage of the cultivated land. The recent trials have unfortunately been limited and scattered. Their results have, however, shown that the method of drainage has affected the crop yield to a surprisingly small extent both where open drainage and deep-drainage are concerned, provided that the side and main ditches have been in order and waterfurrows have been used to a sufficient extent. That the need for drainage seems to be smaller than expected may in part be due to the fact that the ploughing depth has been almost doubled during the last 20—30 years, and that the tilling has become more efficient than before, owing to the increased use of tractor-drawn tillage implements. The scope of the trials In order to solve the drainage problem finally, in the early spring of 1951 the Ministry of Agriculture appointed a special committee of deep-drainage experts, to draw up a plan of the experiments and trials to be carried out all over the country. Mr. A. H. Schroderus, chief engineer at the Board of Agriculture, was appointed chairman of the committee, which otherwise consists of Mr. Veikko Ihamuotila, B. Sc., Dr. Taneli Juusela, Prof. Pentti Kaitera, Prof. Lauri Keso, Mr. H. Korpela, M. A., Mr. Eino H. Seppänen, engineer and Prof. Otto Valle. A general scheme for the trials was confirmed by the Ministry of Agriculture on May 24, 1951. At the same time Dr. Taneli Juusela was appointed by the Ministry to direct this work at the hydrotechnical bureau of the Board of Agriculture. Mr. Erkki Pälikkö has worked from the beginning as the agricultural expert in charge of the investigations. In case of need, students of agronomy have also been used as summer assistants in field work. In tasks such as surveying etc., it has continuously been necessary to employ additional labour. The main part of the scheme consists of the setting up of experiment fields for deep-drainage to be started at four state-owned farms. These are completed by separate experimental areas to be established mostly at private farms in different parts of the country. The expenses involved by the surveying, planning, drawing up of documents, and inspection are financed out of special founds granted for the investigation. Thus these expenses will not burden the owners of the experiment farms. On the other hand, the farmer himself is responsible for the actual drainage work, being granted however, the customary deep-drainage compensation and loan. Experimental deep-drainage areas are to be set up on 143 farms in all. They are divided according to their purposes as follows: Experiments on need of drainage 10 farms » » drain depth 40 » » » drain distance 80 » » » mole drainage 10 » » » gravel drainage 3 » Grants for the basic phase of the trials have been obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture out of funds intended for the promotion of agricultural production and for levelling the costs of same. The annual grants have been as follows: 1951 4.500.000 mk 1952 10.350.000 » 1953 5.623.000 » Total 20.473.000 mk An attempt is being made to have the foundation work of the experimental deep-drainage areas and fields ready within the year 1953. The sums needed annually for the care of the experiment areas and for the treatment of the data obtained are included in the annual budgets of the hydrotechnical bureau of the Department of Agriculture. The purpose of the trials The aim of the drainage trials is to discover and develop methods, better both in terms of ultimate yields and of costs, for use in different circumstances. On the whole, the problem is not only one of deep-drainage. The purpose of the experimental deep-drainage work is to find out when and what kind of deep-drainage is needed and to what extent the fields can be cultivated either entirely without drainage or by using open ditches at greater distances than are used at present. Investigations regarding different drainage methods. When trying to discover more profitable drainage methods than the present ones notice has been taken of the fact that about 44.000 ha. or 35 % of the deep-drained field area has been drained by the famers themselves, using their own materials. In the investigation carried out on about 7.300 ha. of fields thus drained, about 80 % of them werse found to be brush drained. Stone drainage amounted to 15 % and gravel drainage and drainage carried out with various other methods to 5 % of the area investigated. Of the brush drainage, 74 % was in good condition, 22 % satisfactory and only 4 % poor, in spite of the fact that about a quarter of the drains were over 30 years old. Consequently, carefully done brush drainage remains active for an average of at least 30 years. The expences of brush drainage are in general less than half those of tile drainage, provided that no price is counted for the timber (about 5 cu.m, needed for 100 metres of drain). The use of this kind of drainage can still be recommended as a solution preceding deep-drainage on small farms where home labour is easily obtainable. As far as stone drainage is concerned, the conclusion has been reached that there will not be much chance of utilizing this method, owine to the great amount of work involved. Gravel drainage has so far been used to quite a small extent in this country, but it is evident that expenses could be cut down by using this method in regions where gravel of suitable particle size is available in great quantities and the transport distances are not too long. For the purpose of ascertaining the effects of the depth of the drains, the amount and quality of the gravel, the effects of the soil, and the declivity, a few experimental deep-drainage areas will be set up on private farms, situated mostly in parts of the country where this method may find general application on account of the availability of gravel. On the basis of the experiences lately gained in Sweden of mole drainage it is to be supposed that this kind of drainage would be suitable especially on the mud and mud clay areas of Southwest and South Finland, and perhaps on a larger scale also on the heavy clay areas. Besides the investigations regarding the distances and depths of mole drains, the purpose of the trials is to discover the relation between of the durability of the drains and the soil, declivity, frost and other possible factors. Investigations regarding drain depth. A change over to a shallower deep-drainage would help to reduce the expenses of digging the deep-drains and the main ditches. When working out the technical requirements for such a measure, a study has been made of the oldest tile drainages in this country. The bulk of these deep-drainages are over 70 years old and are shallower than the present ones, with an average depth of only 70—90 cm. It is felt that it will be very much helpful to find out, amongst other things, to what extent frost damage and root stoppages are occurring in them. Besides the technical requirements involved in a change over to a shallower deep-drainage system, the effects of such a measure from an economic point of view have to be investigated. For this purpose the effect of drain depth on the crop yield will, amongst other things, be studied on the experiment areas which have been set up in different parts of the country. 60, 90, 120 and 150 cm. are the depths that have been chosen for comparison. Owing to the voluntary nature of the trials private farms cannot be burdened with a sufficient number of simultaneous experiments. The consequent unreliability of the experimental results is to be eliminated by increasing the number of the experiment farms correspondingly. Investigations regarding drain distance. Where the number of drains per areal unit can be decreased, this will cause a nearly corresponding reduction in the total expenses on the deep-drainage work. Thus a change in the drain distance has considerably greater importance in this respect than a change in the depth. Consequently it is considered necessary, in connection with the trials in question, to set up, in addition, a considerable number of experimental areas to ascertain the optimum drain distance in different parts of the country. Two different methods are included in the scheme. The simplest and most general is the method of deep-draining one half of the experimental area by using the present drain distance, while on the other half every other drain is omitted, the distance being thus doubled. The other kind of distance trial is to be tried on farms where a combine is used. In these experiments the present distance, a double one and in some experiments an even broader distance are used alternately. The crops are harvested with the combine from strips parallel to the deep-drains. Consequently the changes in the crops are noticed when drawing farther away from the drain both where the drains are frequent and less frequent. Furthermore attempts are to be made to ascertain the effect of drain distance on the spring drying and its evenness as well as on the capacity of the surface to carry machines.",

The apparent digestibilities of organic matter, crude protein and crude fat in the MBM were 0.910, 0.909 and 0.730, respectively. The MBM was calculated to contain 434 g digestible crude protein, 14.26 MJ metabolizable energy and 8.82 MJ net energy/kg DM. The efficiency of nitrogen utilization decreased with an increasing MBM supply. Due to relatively high mineral intakes, the apparent digestibilities of calcium and phosphorus remained low.",

    "abstract": "The consequences of dose reduction of three new herbicide formulations were studied for the control of annual broad-leaved weeds in fields of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The herbicide formulations were MCPA/mecoprop-P, MCPA/dichlorprop-P and MCPA/fluroxypyr. The efficacy of the lowest recommended dose and a 30% lower rate were tested and compared with the reference herbicide tribenuron-methyl. Trials were conducted at seven sites for three years. Considerable annual fluctuations in weed infestation were recorded. Although the dose reduction occasionally caused considerable decline in control (on %-scale), suppression of weed biomass was still satisfactory in most of the trials. On average, a 75% reduction of weed biomass in spring barley and an 83% reduction in spring wheat were achieved with reduced herbicide doses. Use of reduced herbicide doses for three years in the same fields caused neither a significant increase in weed infestation nor changes in the species composition of weed populations compared with treatments at recommended rates of application. There was a significant difference in biomass production between weed species. Consequently, the total biomass production of annual dicotyledonous weeds correlated only weakly (r=0.48) with the total weed density. Even in untreated plots the weed biomass at harvest constituted, on average, only 3.1-3.6% of the total vegetative biomass of crop stands. Thus, the crop yield responses to chemical weed control remained low.",

The bread making quality of a total of 101 wheat samples was related to flour protein concentration and dough quality determined by the farinograph valorimeter value. Nine quality classes of wheat, similar to the German system of wheat classification, were used as a basis. Because Finnish wheat breeding and cultivation primarily aim at producing grain for bread making, it was not considered necessary to define the quality classes of wheat unsuitable for bread making. Therefore, the number of quality classes were restricted to five: (class 1) medium, (class 2) medium to high, (class 3) high, (class 4) high to very high, and (class 5) very high baking quality. The influence of the environment on the quality traits should be taken into account by comparing the cultivars with a representative control cultivar.",

Nitrogen (N) fertilization of a crop is the main means of manipulating barley β-amylase activity for industrial purposes. In this study, leaf chlorophyll content determined with a portable chlorophyll meter (Minolta SPAD-502) in the field, was used to predict N availability of cv. Kymppi for β-amylase production. Critical chlorophyll meter readings (SPAD values) were calculated from data deriving from experiments with various N fertilizer levels using the Cate-Nelson procedure. According to the results of this study it can be stated that the critical SPAD values at pollination (i.e. pollen grains on well-developed stigmatic hairs, GS 52-58) are 37 SPAD units for grain yield and 41 SPAD units for β-amylase activity. The optimum grain yield occurred at 41 SPAD units and optimum P-amylase activity was reached at 45 SPAD units. Determination of leaf chlorophyll content using the chlorophyll meter led to more appropriate fertilizer application recommendations and subsequently increased β-amylase activity in grains. Grain protein concentration could be an effective diagnostic tool for post-harvest evaluation of grain β-amylase activity in cv. Kymppi.",

In Standardbred trotters, the average energy intake corresponded to the current requirements for light work. The individual variation in energy consumption among horses engaged in work of the same intensity was considerable, and seemed to be larger for Finnhorses than for warmblooded horses.

Performance as well as certain chemical and physical parameters of the tibia and fibula bones were used as criteria for the WB phytase effect. The experiment was conducted using a 2x3 factorial arrangement. The factors were wheat bran (WB) level - either 0 (WB-) or 100 g/kg (WB+), and phosphorus level - high (HP), medium (MP) and low (LP) corresponding to 4.33 g, 2.99 g and 1.64 g digestible P per a feed unit (FU = 0.7 kg starch equivalent), respectively. The measured digestible P contents of the diets were 4.2, 4.2, 2.7, 2.5, 1.4 and 1.8 g/kg DM, respectively. A content of 2.5-2.7 g of digestible P/kg DM in the diet proved to be sufficient for the whole growing period, but the lowest phosphorus levels led to an impaired growth rate, feed consumption and feed conversion ratio. However, after reaching 60 kg live weight, the pigs on LPWB- and LPWB+ diets were able to grow and utilize feed as effectively as the other pigs. WB at a level of 100 g/kg had no significant effect on the performance, feed conversion ratio or carcass quality criteria of the pigs on any diet. WB phytase showed a positive effect on bone breaking strength on the LP diet.",

Protoplasts were successfully isolated from the chopped embryo and scutellum parts of mature barley seeds by digesting three hours with an enzyme mixture. Isolated protoplasts were washed in W5 washing solution, sieved through plastic meshes and then cleaned on sucrose gradient. The suitability of these directly from embryo-scutellum complexes derived protoplasts for transient gene expression studies was determined by transforming the protoplasts using the PEG (polyethylene glycol) method. Plasmid pAct1-F containing the rice Act1 promoter linked with the gus coding sequences and the nos polyadenylation signal was used in the transformation. After the PEG treatment protoplasts were cultured on KPR culture medium and the transient gus expression was assayed 24-36 hours after transformation. Up to 6% of the transformed protoplasts showed gus expression after treating the protoplasts with X-gluc. The results of this study show that the protoplasts isolated directly from dissected mature barley scutellum-embryo complexes could be used to investigate transient gene expressions in barley. This procedure requires negligible time prior the transformation experiment and so can be done in a very short time compared to the protoplast system based on a suspension culture.",

Kalin kokonaiskäyttö lisääntyi, mutta sen suhteellinen osuus sekä varsistossa että mukuloissa pieneni kasvukauden lopulla. Kalsiumin käyttö lisääntyi kuiva-ainesadon nousun suhteessa ja sen siirtyminen mukuloihin nopeutui hiukan. Magnesiumin käyttö lisääntyi yleensä kuiva-ainesadon suhteessa. Kalilannoitus ei vaikuttanut selvästi Pito-perunan typen käyttöön. Fosforin kokonaiskäyttö ei myöskään muuttunut, mutta sen saanti vaikeutui samanaikaisen runsaan N-lannoituksen kanssa. Kalin kokonaiskäyttö ei myöskään muuttunut, vaikka varsinkin varsiston K-pitoisuus nousi. Kalsiumin käyttö ei muuttunut merkitsevästi, joskin suunta oli aleneva. Magnesiumin käyttö väheni ja lehdistön Mg-pitoisuus aleni.",

    "abstract": "Artikkelissa tarkasteltiin säilörehuasteella korjatun timotei- ja nurminatanurmen typpilannoitusta saraturvesuolla. Koeaineisto saatiin kenttäkokeista, jotka järjestettiin v. 1970—73 Suoviljelysyhdistyksen Karjalan koeasemalla Pohjois-Karjalassa. Typpilannoituksina annettiin vuosittain 0, 150, 300 ja 450 kg/ha typpeä kolmessa yhtä suuressa erässä kasvukauden aikana. Sadot korjattiin kolme kertaa kesässä, mikä määrä oli ruohon kehityksen kannalta sopiva. Keskimääräistä kuiva-ainesatoa (Y = t/ha) kuvasi yhtälö Y = 4.97 + 2.07x 0.30 x2, missä x = 100 kg/ha N. Typen satoa lisäävä vaikutus oli paras ensimmäisen vuoden nurmissa. Tällöin saatiin kuiva-ainesadon lisäystä N-kiloa kohti lannoitusvälillä 150—300 kg/ha N keskimäärin 6.9 kg, toisen vuoden nurmissa 3.1 kg ja kolmannen vuoden nurmissa 0.5 kg. Käytettäessä 150 kg/ha N nurmen tuottokyky ei merkittävästi alentunut kolmen vuoden aikana. Suurimpana syynä satotason laskemiseen käytettäessä voimakasta typpilannoitusta oli nurmien harveneminen, jota pääasiassa tapahtui talven aikana. Ruohon kuiva-aineen raakavalkuaispitoisuus oli alhaisin ensimmäisen niittokerran sadossa. Typpilannoitus 50 kg/ha N niittokertaa kohti nosti toisen sadon raakavalkuaispitoisuuden keskimäärin 19.2 ja kolmannen sadon 18.3 %:iin kuiva-aineessa. Typpilannoitus lisäsi ensimmäisten satojen kaliumpitoisuutta. Nurmet ottivat kaliumia selvästi yli kasvun edellyttämän tarpeen. Ruohon magnesiumpitoisuus oli alhaisin ensimmäisen niittokerran sadossa. Typpilannoitus lisäsi yleensä magnesiumin osuutta kuiva-aineessa. Ruohon nitraattipitoisuus nousi erittäin selvästi typpilannoituksen vaikutuksesta. Vaikka vaihtuvan kalsiumin määrä turpeessa pieneni voimakkaan typpilannoituksen yhteydessä, pH:n muutos jäi vähäiseksi. Turpeen sisältämä kalium väheni selvästi voimakasta typpilannoitusta käytettäessä. Sopivimmaksi typpimääräksi säilörehunurmelle osoittautui 220—240 kg/ha N, mikä kolmeen osaan jaettuna oli edullisinta painottaa kevätkesälle.",

The correlation of the ultrasonic area measurements with the carcass amounts of fat and lean -f- bone and with the fat-lean ratio calculated from these was closer than that of the ultrasonic thickness measurements. The fat-lean ratio calculated from the areas was also slightly better correlated to carcass quality than was the ratio calculated from the thickness measurements. In other respects the fat thickness measurements appeared to be better than area measurement. Although the measurement of lean correlated to the carcass a value of the animal more poorly than the fat measurements, the highest correlations were nevertheless obtained by the combined use of the fat and lean measurements.",

    "abstract": "Kainuulaisia uudistiloja koskevat LP-laskelmat ovat edellisen mukaisesti johtaneet siihen tulokseen, että traktoritekniikan omaksuminen vallitsevissa olosuhteissa johtaa viljelijäperheen työvoiman tehokkaampaan ja tuottavampaan hyväksikäyttöön, kuin hevostekniikka, joskin kummankin tekniikan yhdistäminen tilojen keskeisellä yhteistyöllä parantaisi tässä ainakin hevostilojen tuloksia. Viljelyaloja erityisesti turvemailla kannattaa laajentaa ja lypsylehmien lukua lisätä, jolloin päästään korkeampaan katetuottoon. Ruohovasikan mukaanottaminen tuotantosuunnitelmaan ei vuosien 1959—63 hintatason mukaan ollut kannattavaa, mutta v. 1972 hintojen mukaan niillä voidaan hevostilojen katetuottoa kohottaa. Traktoritekniikan omaksuneet tilat voivat edullisesti laajentaa viljelyalansa 20—22 ha:iin ja pitää n. 18 lehmää, mikä kyllä edellyttää nykyistä suurempia navetoita ja navettatyön ainakin osittaista koneistamista. Sika voisi tulla tuotantosuunnitelmaan lähinnä silloin, jos sianlihan hinnat suhteessa maidon ja viljan hintoihin olisivat edullisempia. Lampaanpidon kannattavuus ei ole ollut riittävän hyvä, että se olisi voinut tulla maidontuotannon kanssa kilpailukykyiseksi vallinneissa hintasuhteissa. Edullisimman tuotantosuunnitelman mukaan kannattaa kivennäismailla oleva metsä, jonka enimmäisala on tässä rajoitettu 80 hehtaariin, hoitaa järkeviä metsänhoitotoimenpiteitä ja mm. harvennushakkuita suorittaen hyvin, ja työvoima riittää siihen. Ellei pinta-alarajoitusta olisi, tällaista metsää sisältyisi tuotantosuunnitelmaan enemmänkin. Turvemaan metsien hoito, sen jälkeen kuin ne olisi saatettu tuottokuntoiseksi, lisäisi mahdollisuuksia laajentaa metsätalouden osuutta taloussuunnitelmassa. Turvemaalla esiintyvien metsättömien tai kitukasvuisten metsämaiden ojittaminen, vaikkapa vain ihmistyönäkin, on tulovaikutuksiltaan siksi kilpailukykyinen, että se erityisesti työvoiman täydellisempää hyväksikäyttöä edistäen tulee vuoden 1959—63 hintasuhteissa mukaan suunnitelmaan. Puuston hakkuuarvon koron huomioonottaminen muuttuvana kustannuksena muuttaa metsätalouden järjestelyä lyhyen kiertoajan suuntaan ja vähentää metsätalouden suhteellista merkitystä. Tutkimuksessa on tarkasteltu myöskin nurmen hehtaarisadon suuruuden vaikutusta edullisimpaan tuotantosuunnitelmaan. 10 %:n lisäykset tai vähennykset sadossa tuntuivat n. 500—1 000 markan lisäyksinä tai vähennyksinä katetuotossa ja eräinä muutoksina mm. metsätalouden työn käytössä. Viikottaisen työajan rajoittaminen työaikalain mukaiseen 40 tuntiin, edellyttääen kuitenkin, että rajoituksia ei suoranaisesti sovelleta kiirekausina, alentaa katetuottoa eri tapauksissa 860 ja 3600 mk välillä tilaa kohden. Metsätalous jää tällöin miltei kokonaan pois optimaalisesta tuotantosuunnitelmasta eräissä traktoritekniikan vaihtoehdoissa. Jotta saataisiin kuva hintasuhteiden vaikutuksista, on suunnitelmissa otettu mukaan vaihtoehto, jossa maidon hinta olisi vastannut suunnilleen maailmanmarkkinoiden määräämää tasoa. Kuten oli odotettavissa, naudan-, sian- ja lampaanlihan tuotanto on tällöin tullut suuremmassa määrin mukaan, mutta katetuotot ovat olleet tuntuvasti alhaisempia. Eri vaihtoehtoja verrattaessa on siis voitu huomata myöskin vallitsevien hintasuhteiden tuntuva vaikutus tuotannon edullisimpaan järjestelyyn. Valtion hintapolitiikalla on näihin ollut suuri vaikutus. Näyttää siltä, että Kainuun viljelijät ovat jotakuinkin hyvin pystyneet päättelemään, mikä tuotantosuunta vallitsevissa hintasuhteissa on kannattava. Kuten tutkimusaikana vallinnutta talousmuotoa tarkasteltaessa (.p 364) on käynyt ilmi, viljelijät ovat järjestäneet maataloustuotantonsa pääasiassa lypsykarjatalouteen perustuvaksi.",

The amounts of residual nitrogen as well as the dates and depth for sampling are considerd in order to investigate the need of fertilizer-N for continuous sugar beet. Tops ploughed down as manure increased the available soil nitrogen by about 50 kg/ha. In practice nitrogen from fertilizer and farmyard manure given to previous beet crops seems to accumulate in the beet soils of Finland. The concentrations of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen in topsoil were low in the spring of 1972 and 1973. NO3-N increased in topsoil during the early summer, and the highest concentrations were found at the beginning of July. Starting from the middle of July the amount of NH4-N began to increase both in topsoil and in subsoil. With increasing amounts of nitrogen in the topsoil the sugar content decreases continuously. Also the α-amio N content of beets correlates with the soil nitrogen. There is experimental evidence that 150 180 kg/ha nitrate nitrogen in topsoil (residual + fertilizer N) in early July gives the best economic result. The effects of fertilizer and accumulated soil nitrogen on the sugar beet quality together with som other experimental data have been statistically analysed. Regression coefficients indicated that both forms of nitrogen affected the suger content, the α-amino N concentration and clear juice purity, in a similar way.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the organic content and biological activity of the soil have been made on two farms belonging to the Agricultural College of Sweden. The soil analyses on the two farms were compiled during the 1930’5, and the samples taken at the time, as well as the maps used during the sampling, have been preserved. Some parts of the farms were again sampled in the early 1970’s. The samples from the two series have been analysed for organic carbon. In some of the samples the biological activity was determined in incubation experiments and the organic matter was fractionated. The areas chosen for the investigation represent different soil types and have different cropping backgrounds. Some of them have been cultivated for several hundred years while others have only recently been brought under the plough. The determinations of organic carbon show that the humus content in the recently broken soils decreased considerably during the 40 years separating the samplings. The magnitude of the decrease partly depends on the extent of the decomposition at the first sampling, partly on the moisture conditions. In some cases decreases of the humus content were also registered in the older fields. This may be due to intensified soil cultivations and improved drainage. The amount of easily decomposable substances in the initial samples was larger than in the later ones. This difference maybe partly due to changes taking place during storage, and the results suggest that to some extent it may also depend on a higher biological activity in the soil at the initial sampling.",

Two different series of soil mixtures were prepared with increasing additions of clay soil up to 25 vol. % clay, the additions being made both to fines and and Sphagnum peat soils. The content of phosphorus in plants and the yield increased to some extent in fines and/clay soil mixtures with an increase in the clay content. In peat soil increasing additions of clay soil caused a decrease in the phosphorus content of the plant but had no significant effect on the amount of the yield. In fines and/clay soils the uptake of phosphorus by the oat from the fertilizer increased from3 to 10 %, in peat/clay soils it decreased from 60 to 20 % with an increasing clay content of the soils. The isotope dilution method was not applicable in the determining of the labile phosphorus of the experimental soil mixtures. This was assumed to be due to the small concentrations and concentration differences in soluble native soil phosphorus and to the strong fixing capacities of the soils. The contents of other nutrient elements in plants generally decreased with an increasing clay content. The most marked exceptions in this respect were the content of phosphorus in plants growing on fines and/clay soils and the content of potassium and manganese on peat/clay soils.",

Replacing 50–60% of mineral fertilizer N with green manure from a mixture of three clover species did not compromise the crop yield of winter or spring wheat. The results suggest that mulching of the green manure in the spring succeeding its sowing is the most beneficial practice with respect to environmental impacts. Total N leaching was higher from sandy soil than from silt loam whereas emissions of N2O were higher from the silt soil. Residual N from the clover biomass did not lead to an increase in leaching losses of N during the growing season or one year from the harvest.

    "abstract": "This is a comment on Valentinov's article \"Third sector organizations in rural development\", Volume 18 (2009), pp.3-15.Summing up Valentinov theses, there are three main statements to be mentioned: 1) the market-hierarchy continuum by Williamson is only applicable to the forprofit sector, 2) rural transaction costs represent non-changeable 'brute facts', and 3) third sector organizations (TSOs) in general (partially) rely on self-sufficiency.Each statement is reviewed critically below.As his focus is efficiency and operational capability (Williamson 1991, p. 17) Williamson shows no reluctance to analyze a TSO by means of transaction cost analysis.Besides, Williamson explicitly names \"nonprofits\" when describing different governance structures (Williamson 2000, p. 599).Accordingly, to illustrate the transferability of the continuum's criteria, Valentinov's self-helping organizations can be considered as institutions with 1) independent property rights, e. g. members possess the property rights of their resources, 2) pooled success attribution, e. g. pooled consumption of outputs, and 3) a certain subjection to directives, e. g. rules of how consumption is managed fairly.Hence, self-sufficient organizations can be considered as institutions with a hybrid character somewhere in between the two poles of the market-hierarchy-continuum.To distinguish different transaction forms from one another asset specificity, uncertainty, and frequency have to be considered; whereas the frequency dimension often comprises the transaction atmosphere additionally (Williamson 1985, p. 60).The atmosphere covers all sociocultural and technical factors that influence the transaction costs of different governance mechanisms.With the help of these dimensions distinctive characteristics of transactions and therewith specified transaction costs can be defined.When Valentinov describes the characteristics of rural areas he in fact refers to the dimension of transaction atmosphere.Here, market size and its number of actors can be taken into consideration (see Williamson 1985, p. 60) as they lead to characteristics that influence transaction costs: compared to anonymous urban relationships and due to low population density, economic units in rural areas know each other well, are in",

    "abstract": "Several series of experiments were arranged so as to study in the rat 1) the effect of the degree of the charge of the stomach upon its rate of emptying, and 2) the rate of passage of the food in the empty small intestine. It was observed that the fullness of the stomach had a positive influence on its rate of emptying. In the empty small intestine the transport of the food after the commencement of the meal is very rapid during the first 5 minutes. In this time the food is carried a distance from the pylorus comprising 53—65 % of the length of the small intestine. Five minutes later 65— 78 % of the small intestine contains experimental food. However, the terminal ileum does not appear to be less filled than the other parts of the small intestine. It contains a slimy liquid which has been forced from the »empty» small intestine towards the caecum. Evidently the ileocaecal valve has remained closed. Only after about 1 ½ hours does the food reach the distal end of the small intestine. It is obvious that the rapid filling of the duodenum and jejunum immediately after the beginning of the meal cannot be explained by the classical conception of peristalsis described by Bayliss and Starling. It is remarkable that in the rat the transport of food in the empty small intestine seems to occur at about the same relative rate as in man.",

    "abstract": "The interference of ferric and ferrous iron in the determination of phosphate by the molybdenum blue method has been studied. It was found that the presence of ferric iron in the solutions could cause either an increase or a decrease in the colour intensity depending on the amount of stannous chloride applied and on the acid and molybdate concentrations in the reagent. Also the phosphorus concentration exerted its effect upon the course of the errors. If the original modification of Truog and Meyer was employed, generally, the most convenient way for the elimination of the interference of ferric iron was to dilute the solution. An increase in the amount of stannous chloride largely helped to prevent the fading effect of ferric iron, provided the phosphorus concentration was not lower than 0.25 ppm. When the effect of ferric iron upon the development of molybdenum blue at various concentrations of sulphuric acid and ammonium molybdate was studied, the observation was made that at each acidity there could be found a concentration of molybdate in which the effect of even fairly high amounts of ferric iron was almost negligible. In lower molybdate concentrations the presence of ferric iron caused an increase in the colour intensity, in higher molybdate concentrations the fading effect of ferric iron was marked. This most suitable level of the molybdate concentration depended to a certain degree on the phosphorus concentration of the solution and on the amount of stannous chloride applied. Fairly good results could be obtained, if the ratio of molybdate (expressed as mg/ml) to acid (expressed as normality) in the solution to be reduced was five times as high as the acidity of the solution to be reduced (expressed as its normality), e.g. 4 in 0.8 N acid, 3.5 in 0.7 N acid, 3 in 0.6 N acid etc. Although it seemed to be fairly possible to avoid the interference of ferric iron by a proper choice of the concentrations of acid and molybdate and of the amount of stannous chloride applied, the fading effect of ferrous iron could not be prevented, if only sulphuric acid was used in the reagents. But the substitution of sulphuric acid by hydrochloric acid totally prevented the fading effect of ferrous iron. On the contrary, a slight increase in the colour intensity was demonstrated. This was true also when only one half of the acid present was hydrochloric acid. It was found that this mixture of sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid in the molybdate reagent offers an available way for the elimination of the disturbing effect of iron.",

Das Verhältnis zwischen Roh- und Reinprotein ist auf beiden bodenarten dasselbe geblieben (Tab. 6), so dass die stickstoffhaltigen Stoffe in beiden Fällen gleichwertig zu sein scheinen. Eine Ausnahme gegenüber den übrigen Versuchen machte der Sommerweizen in dem Versuchsjahr 1947 (Tab. 4).

    "abstract": "Quite frequently the empirical demand analysis has to be based on time-series data on prices and quantities sold. However, the seasonal fluctuation of demand may cause some systematic errors in the demand function derived from this type of data. In the first place there is the question of whether it is correct to regard the butter demand as causally dependent on the butter price, or is it necessary to propose some bilateral interdependence between prices ans quantities sold. In the literature on demand analysis unilateral dependence has generally been regarded as axiomatic. This approach is based mainly on the fact that the consumer is confronted with fixed prices at the store, bargaining being practically absent (7). Knowing from previous experience the effects of seasonal fluctuation of demand sellers at a given market might tend to counteract this fluctuation by changing prices. Under price control this might affect the decisions of the responsible authorities, also. Thus the question of dependence requires careful consideration in each case studied. The changing demand conditions might cause errors in a more technical sense, also. E.g. if the effect of a change in price is studied during a period of decreasing demand, market statistics might be misleading in the way illustrated in figure 3. The curve Q refers to the quantities sold as given by market statistics. During the two first weeks an average quantity of ON has been sold. After a certain decrease in price, in the beginning of third week an increase in sales takes place so that during the third and fourth week averagely OM has been sold. The effect of the price change now seems to be NM. This, of course, is incorrect, since the basis for the comparison should be the quantity OK to which the sales would have decreased without the change in price. Consequently, the real effect of the price change is KM. The numerical value for the observation 3in the diagram cannot be obtained from ordinary market statistics, however. Under normal conditions it is difficult to study the problems outlined above. During the last few years the conditions on the butter market in Finland offer some interesting data from this point of view. Butter has been under price control for many years, whereas the demand for each prevailing price has been well satisfied. After a period of violent changes during 1950 and 1951 the price of butter has been stable during the latter part of 1952 and all through 1953. The sales of butter during the stable price period now offer valuable assistance for the calculation of the price elasticity for the years 1950—51. The fluctuation indices (deviations from 12-month average) of butter prices and quantities sold are presented in figures 4 and 5. The Q53 curve represents the sales-index of the same type under a stable price. It is readily seen that if this seasonal fluctuation, which is represented by the 1953 sales-index, were disregarded, the regression calculation would be less significant. In figure 6 the seasonal fluctuation has been eliminated by dividing the indices of quantities sold for each month by the corresponding indices for 1953. The elasticity coefficients calculated from the corrected as well as from the original data are presented in table 1. The tests of significance argue very clearly in favour of the method of correction used.",

Die Versuchsmaterialien enthielten sechs auf Grund des Zuckergehalts gewählte Stämme: 2 zuckerreiche, 2 mittelmässige und 2 mit niedrigem Prozent. Der Vergleich umfasste sowohl das Rüben- als auch das Stecklingstadium Die als Rüben zu untersuchenden Parallelproben wurden einem dafür angelegten Feldversuch allwöchentlich von Mitte August bis Ende Oktober entnommen. Durch Beobachtung der Entwicklung mehrerer Eigenschaften nebeneinander und in vielen aufeinanderfolgenden Jahren wurde versucht, die Ergebnisse hinreichend zuverlässig zu erhalten sowie festzustellen, wie gross die Unterschiede in der Dauer der Vegetationsperiode sind. Die Ergebnisse sind auf Grund graphischer Darstellungen festgelegte annähernde Werte. Vergleichsergebniss Durch Veränderungen in der Farbe der Blätter Hessen sich keine Unterschiede in der Frühreife heraussteilen, ebensowenig durch die Entwicklung im Krautgewicht, obgleich sich die Versuchsglieder in der Krautgrösse sogar sehr voneinander unterschieden haben. Im Abschluss des Wachsens der Wurzel haben sich Unterschiede herausgebildet, die auch durch die Zuckergehalt-, Asche- und Stecklingergebnisse gestütz werden. Als Mittelwert dreier Jahre macht im Material der Jahre 1947—49 der grösste Unterschied 7 Tage aus. Bei den zuckerhaltigen Sorten erlangt das Wachstum schneller sein volles Mass als bei den niedrigprozentigen, aber ertragreichen. Bei der Gruppe der massig zuckerhaltigen Sorten ist die Vegetationsperiode am kürzesten, trotz dem entgegengesetzten Ertragsunterschied, und dies erweist, dass erblich frühreif auch andere als die allerzuckerreichsten Stämme sein können (4). Im Zuckergehalt machte der in der Vegetationsperiode bestehende Unterschied zwischen der gemeinsamen Vegetationsperiodengruppe der zuckerreichen und massigen Stämme und der Gruppe der niedrigprozentigen im J. 1949 wenigstens eine Woche aus. Die Entwicklung im Aschegehalt erwies sich in denverschiedenen Jahren und bei den verschiedenen Versuchsgliedern als sehr verwirrt. Das Jahr 1949 vertrat eine günstige Vegetationsperiode, und damals erlangten die zuckerhaltigen Stämme ihr Minimum am 30. 9,. etwa eine Woche vor den niedrigprozentigen. Für »schädlichen Stickstoff» sind keine den Abschluss der Vegetationsperiode und die Reife ausdrückenden Ergebnisse erhalten worden. Bei den Stecklingen beliefen sich die Unterschiede in der Vegetationsperiode zwischen den extremen in den J. 1947—49 auf fünf Tage, sie waren gleicher Grössenordnung wie im Rübenjahre. Die längste Vegetationsperiode hatten die niedrigprozentigen und der eine zuckerreiche Stamm, die kürzeste der andere zuckerige und die mässigen.",

The method employed in these observations (5) made it possible to acquire a clear picture about the position of the rhizomes and roots, about their extent and about the depht of the roots. As we have not sufficient information about these things (2), I thought it desirable to publish the obtained facts, scarce as my observations are. The rhizomes of couch grass are confined to a very thin surface layer in the furrow slice, the maximum depth being usually 10 cm. Only in one of the cases I examined the maximum depth was 15 cm. Possibly a very airy soil and cultivation in spring contributed to this case. Some facts seem to indicate that rhizomes die, if they are deeper in the soil than 10 cm. In general couch grass is considered a very shallow-rooted plant (fig. 3, a quotation from Korsmo, 2), but my observations show that the root system of couch grass is very profuse and penetrates deep into the soil, the maximum depth being 60—90 cm., which is the same as the maximum depth of the roots of field crops.",

    "abstract": "In der Staatlichen Samenkontrollanstalt ist aus den Ernten von Jahren 1951 und 1952 von insgesamt 223 Getreideproben die Keimfähigkeit mit dem Tetrazolium-Verfahren untersucht, und die somit gewonnenen Keimergebnisse mit denselben vom Keimversuche in Sandkeimbett verglichen worden. Da die klimatischen Verhältnisse hier bei uns ganz anders wie in südlicheren Gegenden sind, und infolge dessen die frostgeschädigten und beim Trocknen geschädigten Getreideproben in vielen Jahren sehr allgemein sind, wurde eine besondere Aufmerksamkeit auf diese Weise geschädigten Proben gewidmet. Die Ernte vom Jahre 1952 war sehr geeignet für diese Versuche, weil während der Reifeperiode im Spätsommer Frost beinahe in allen Teilen des Landes vorkam. Auch wegen der regnerischen Erntezeit waren beim Trocknen geschädigten Proben allgemein. In der Beurteilung der Färbung ist hauptsächlich (182 Proben) das Lakonsche Verfahren und zum Teil die von Cottrell (3) angewendete Methode verwendet worden. Die Tetrazolium-Versuche wurden 3—S Wochen nach den Keimversuchen gemacht. Bei den untersuchten 182 Proben, die nach dem Lakonschen Verfahren geprüft worden waren wurden mit Tetrazolium-Methode durchschnittlich 5.7 % höhere Keimergebnisse als mit gewöhnlichen Keimversuch im Sandkeimbett erhalten. In 14 Fällen wurden mit Tetrazolium-Methode niedrigere, in 158 Fällen höhere Ergebnisse erhalten und in 10 Fällen gaben die beiden Methoden ebenso grosse Ergebnisse (Tab. 1.u. Abb. 1). Bei einzelnen hauptsächlich frostgeschädigten und beim Trocknen geschädigten Proben traten einige ziemlich grosse Abweichungen von 19 -27 % auf (Tab. 1). Bei Proben, die mit der Halbierungsmethode untersucht wurden, wurden durch Färbung durchschnittlich 1.2 % höhere Ergebnisse wie mit Keimversuche in Sandkeimbett erhalten (Tab. 2). Die gute Relation zwischen den beiden Methoden kann jedoch zufällig wegen der wenigen Probenanzahl (41. Proben) sein. Auch die Verletzungen vom Frost und von Trocknung traten verhältnismässig leicht auf. Die grössten Abweichungen 14, 12 und 10 % traten bei den frostgeschädigten Proben auf. Das Tetrazolium-Verfahren erwies sich also nach der verwendeten Beurteilungsmethode als unsicher wenn es sich besonders um schlecht keimenden und auf obengenannte Weise geschädigten Proben handelte. Am besten stimmten die Ergebnisse bei Wintergetreide welches offenbar von der hohen durchschnittlichen Keimfähigkeit der Proben abhängt. Nur eine Winterweizenprobe war leicht von Frost geschädigt. Bei der Beurteilung der Färbung wurde festgestellt, dass bei Proben, die sich als frostgeschädigt und beim Trocknen geschädigt erwiesen, ein Teil von den völlig gefärbten Embryonen sich abweichend aus Normal sehr intensiv rot gefärbt hatten. Die Anzahlen dieser anormal gefärbten Embryonen sind auf der Tabelle 1 enthalten. Offenbar ist, dass mindestens ein Teil von diesen Embryonen bei der Beurteilung zu den ungenügend gefärbten zu rechnen wären. Doch ist zu beachten, dass die Feststellung dieser anormal gefärbten wegen verkommenden Zwischenfällen unsicher war. Dazu wurde festgestellt, dass die Grenzen zwischen totem und lebendem Gewebe nicht bei frostgeschädigten und beim Trocknen geschädigten Proben klar w7ar, welches Schwierigkeiten bei der Beurteilung bot.",

    "abstract": "Investigations of the importance of artificial hormones with regard to weed control were begun in Finland at the Department of Plant Husbandry of Agricultural Research Institute Tikkurila, in 1946. Investigations were continued in 1947 and 1948. As is generally known, artificial hormones, if given in suitable amounts, destroy many herbaceous plants, but do not usually have injurious effects on graminous plants. All herbaceous plants, however, are not equally susceptible, and as well among cultivated plants as among weeds there are some rather resistant species. Oil flax is one of these herbaceous cultivated plants, which is more susceptible than graminous plants, but at the same time is more resistant to artificial hormones than most weeds. Thus it is possible to use artificial hormones for weed control in oil flax cultivations. The safety margin between resistance and injury, however, is for oil flax smaller than for cereals. The results of the experiments, which were carried out at the Department of Plant Husbandry and which deal with the resistance of oil flax, have already been published (10). In this study, which is based on other experiments with artificial hormones conducted at the Department of Plant Husbandry in 1947 and 1948, attention is paid mainly to the effect of different preparations on some species of weeds occurring in oil flax cultivations. Following conclusions, among others, may be drawn from the experiments; 1. Of the preparations used Weedone (ethyl ester of 2,4-D) had so injurious an effect on the yield of oil flax that it is almost impossible to use it in oil flax cultivations. On the other hand, none of the other preparations used, whether 2,4-D or 2M-4K compounds, caused any reduction in the yield. On the contrary, in 1947 when the experimental area was heavily infested with weeds, especially with Chenopodium album, all treatments resulted in distinct increase in yield (103—363 %, p. 98). For 2M-4K the results thus agree with earlier investigations (3, 6, 10, 14), but not for 2,4-D. According to the above-mentioned investigations 2,4-D compounds usually have injurious effects on the yield of oil flax. That they (with the exception of Weedone) did not result in injurious effects in the present experiments may be due to the fact that pure aqueous solutions of 2,4-D are not sufficiently absorbed by oil flax (cp. 10, pp. 41—45). 2. Sprays (applied at the rate of 1000 1. per ha.) were on the whole more effective than dusts, though in 1948 the applied dusts contained twice as much effective substance as the sprays. Evidently dusts cannot penetrate into plants as easily as sprays, in which the effective substance appears in dissolved state already at the time of treatment. Besides, as the price of dusts is 4—5 times that of sprays, their use cannot be recommended to farmers at least not in the present form. 3. There are significant differences in the effectiveness of different sprays. In our experiments 2,4-D compounds (with the exception of Weedone), which are generally considered more effective than 2M-4K compounds, did not eradicate weeds so effectively as 2M-4K compounds. So in 1947 about kg. of sodium salt of 2,4-D per ha. applied as an aqueous solution (Veith, Hormotox) destroyed 95 % of Chenopodium album and 31 % of other weeds, about 1 kg. per ha. correspondigly 96 and 58 %. In 1948 0.8 kg. of the sodium salt of 2,4-D per ha. applied as an aqueous solution (Hormoxol) destroyed 65 % of the weeds occurring in the experimental area. The reason for this is probably the same as the one mentioned under the first item: deficient absorption of the compounds by plants. On the other hand, all the 2M-4K compounds used seem to contain substances which reduce surface tension, and they have been very effective. In 1947 y 2 kg. of 2M-4K per ha. (Acodrin) destroyed 100 % of Chenopodium album and 68 % of other weeds, 1 kg. per ha. correspondingly 100 and 80 %. In 1948 0.8 kg. of 2M-4K per ha. (Acodrin, Agroxone, P 46) destroyed 68—85 % of the weeds occurring in the experimental area. 4. The eradication percentage of weeds seems to be essentially dependent not only on the compounds used, on the stage of development and on the rapidity of growing of the plants, but also on the species of weeds occurring in the area. If the main weed is some species which is easily eradicated (e.g. Raphanus, Chenopodium, Erysimum, Capsella, Thlaspi), ½ kg. of the effective substance per ha. may be sufficient to kill it. If more resistant species occur among them (e.g. Cirsium, Sonchus, Stachys, Equisetum, Galeopsis, Spergula, Stellarid), larger amounts of effective substance must be used, especially as oil flax is well resistant up to 1 kg. per ha. (cp. 3, 10). If very resistant species form the main part of the weed vegetation (e.g. Polygonum, Viola, Fumaria, Lapsana, Galium, Tussilago), it is uncertain, whether artificial hormones give such results as to cover the expenses caused by the use of artificial hormones. It is namely impossible to eradicate very resistant species in oil flax cultivations, their growth can only be retarded, and their flowering and seed formation prevented.",

    "abstract": "The present investigation deals with the determination of the relation between the fat and protein contents of Finnish milk as well as the possibility of estimating the casein content by the formol titration method described by Walker, modified by McDowall and Dolby. The ratio of protein to fat in Finnish milk is lower than in the other Northern Countries. In the past 30 years the ratio of protein to fat in Finnish milk has been slightly reduced, apparently owing both to the feeding and to the influence of breeding, which have tended to increase the fat content. It is well known that in milk samples with a high fat content the protein content is proportionally lower than in milk with a fat content below the average. The correlation between the fat and total protein contents both in bulk milk and in milk samples from various herds is, from a practical point of view, the same as the correlation between their fat and casein contents. The smaller the portion of milk involved, the more difficult it is to estimate its protein content from the fat percentage. The correlation between fat and protein contents in bulk milk is, again, much more stable than in milk from individual cows. The correlation coefficient for the fat and protein contents in bulk milk is + 0.726 ± 0.06, the corresponding coefficient in milk from various herds is + 0.535 ± 0.05 and in milk samples from individual cows, + 0.432 ± 0.07. The respective correlation coefficients for the fat and casein contents are: + 0.735 ± 0.05; + 0.590± 0.03 and + 0.277 ± 0.09. The casein percentages in milk samples from various herds and in those from individual cows have been determined by the formol titration method. For the calculation of the conversion factor between formol valne and true casein content, the latter has also been determined by the A.O.A.C. method, after which the conversion factor has been given as the ratio between the A.O.A.C. value and the formol valne. The accuracy of the various determinations with formol titration is indicated by the standard deviations (table 2). The standard deviations of the conversion factors indicate that the casein content of milk samples from various herds can be estimated with an accuracy of ± 5 %. The accuracy of casein estimations in milk samples from individual cows is on the average ± 13 %, which cannot be considered adequate even for practical purposes. In addition, the conversion factors reveal seasonal fluctuations which are due to the proportional variations between casein and other protein components in various milk samples.",

Syysvehnän aikainen tuleentuminen on omiaan varmistamaan sadon laadun hyvyyden, lakoutuneisuus ja loppukesän sateisuus saattaa sitä vaarantaa. Varmalla ja Olympialla on tiettyjä viljelybiologisia heikkouksia, jotka rajoittavat niiden viljelyä; Vakkaan kiinnitetään toiveita. Syysvehnän jalostustyössä vaativat vehnän jauhatusominaisuudet osakseen ilmeisesti entistä suurempaa huomiota. Kevätvehnästä on käytettävissä olevalla lajikevalikoimalla sen laatutaso pidettävissä tyydyttävällä korkeudella. Kotimaisessa jalostustyössä on varsin edullisesti onnistuttu yhdistämään sovelias aikaisuus ja hyvät leivontaominaisuudet (B tai lähes A luokka). Ruotsalaisilla jalosteilla on, niiden monien edullisten viljelyominaisuuksien ohessa suhteellinen myöhäisyys haittana, nimenomaan kvaliteettituotantoa ajatellen. Kevätvehnän viljelyssä meillä on kiinnitettävä erityistä huomiota lajikkeitten aikaisuuteen, ja kullekin viljelyalueelle on koetettava saada aikaisuuden puolesta soveliaat lajikkeet. Vehnän lajiketilanne on meillä nykyisin sellainen, että sääsuhteiltaan normaalisina ja normaalista edullisempina kesinä voimme itse tuottaa laadultaan tyydyttävän vehnäviljan. Sääsuhteiltaan epäedulliset kesät (koleus, sateisuus, hallaisuus ym.) vaikuttavat erityisesti kevätvehnän kvaliteettiin. Tästä syystä ja syysvehnän suhteellisen runsaan satoisuuden vuoksi olisi erityisesti syysvehnän viljelyä lisättävä. Vehnälajikkeittemme suhteellisen korkea kvaliteettitaso on tärkeätä ottaa huomioon pyrittäessä vehnäntuotannossa omavaraisuutta kohti ja järjestettäessä vehnäviljan tuontia ulkomailta. Vehnän hyvällä kvaliteetilla on huomattava kansantaloudellinen merkitys.",

    "abstract": "In der Untersuchung sind die Mittelwerte der an Gebiete verschiedener Landwirtschaftsgesellschaften abgegebenen Töchter von 248 Ayrschirebullen miteinander verglichen worden. Für jeden Bullen sind so zwei Mittelwerte von wenigstens fünf Töchtern berechnet worden. Im Mittel gab es bei den verschiedenen Ergebnissen der Nachkommenbeurteilung der Bullen 13.2 und 13.1 Töchter. Die Ergebnisse stützen sich auf die im Untersuchungsjahr 1951—52 gegebenen Leistungen. Wie aus Tabelle S. 38 zu ersehen, ist jetzt, da der Vergleich zwischen den in recht verschiedener Umgebung gewesenen Töchtern angestellt worden ist, die für die relativen Milchleistungen erhaltener Korrelation ziemlich sicher (0.17**) und grösser als die Korrelation (0.10) der absoluten Milchleistungen. Auch sind die relative und die absolute Milchleistung des einen Mittelwertes sowie die durchschnittliche Leistung der Herde stets mit den relativen Leistungen des anderen Mittelwertes verglichen. Da die relative Leistung die Stellung des Tieres in seiner Herde bezeichnet, erweist der so durchgeführte Vergleich am besten, welche Beurteilungsweise im Mittel zu der gelungensten Auslese führt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass, wenn die Auslese des Bullen auf Grund des Mittelwertes der einen Tochtergruppe geschehen wäre, die Auslese nach dem hohen Mittelleistungsniveau an der neuen Stelle praktisch gesehen keine besseren Resultate gebracht hätte als eine Auslese nach dem niederen Mittelleistungsniveau (0.02). Eine auf die absoluten Milchleistungen gegründete Auslese hätte die Veredlungsarbeit gefördert (0.12), aber das beste und sicherste Ergebnis wäre durch eine relative Beurteilung (0.17**) erlangt worden. Auch die Korrelation der übrigen bei der Nachkommenbeurteilung berechneten Ergebnisse ist ermittelt worden. Die aus den Fettprozentsätzen gewonnene Korrelation (0.40***) erweist, dass auch die Mittelwerte der Töchter zu einer recht gelungenen Auslese führen. Es ist zu bemerken, dass die Korrelation zwischen den mittleren Fettprozentsätzen der Herden nur 0.13* betrug. Bei der Kontrollbuchhaltung gelten als regelmässige Kühe solche Tiere, die das ganze Jahr über gesund gewesen sind und regelmässig gekalbt haben mit einer Zwischenzeit von höchstens 15 Monaten. Das Regelmässigkeitsprozent erweist, wie viele Nachkommen eines Bullen prozentual regelmässig gewesen sind. Bei diesem Material ist die Korrelation dieser Prozentsätze ziemlich schwach gewesen (0.06). Das Gewicht, für das sich die Korrelation 0.21*** ergeben hat, ist durch das Bemessen: Länge - Brustumfang2: 10 000 berechnet worden.",

    "abstract": "During the last growth season 1949 the author has had an opportunity to acquaint himself e.g. with the plant breeding work in the United States, especially in Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and in Beltsville Maryland. In this paper a short survey of the inbreeding, heterosis, and the combining ability has been given. Also the most common methods used in the breeding of corn, sugar beet, and forage crops have been described. As to the corn breeding work the top cross nursery, methods of production of single-cross and double-cross seed, and of maintaining inbred lines for seed production of hybrid corn, predicting the yield of double crosses by means of the yields of single crosses, as well as the three-way cross, and convergent crossing methods, and the production of synthetic variety have been described. The history concerning the breeding of sugar beet in U.S.A. has been shortly reported, including e.g. the methods used in breeding for disease resistance (leaf spot and curly top), selfing and production of hybrids, the means of polyploidy (tetraploids and triploids) as well as male sterility, the breeding for single and double germ seeds in relation to the mechanization of the field operations, and changing the shape of sugar beet from peg-top in shape to globe shape beets in order to get an easy-lifting beet and thus reduce the breakage of roots and costs in harvesting them mechanically. In describing the breeding methods of forage crops the polycross method and its use for producing hybrid seed has been reported in the main points. Comparisons with the open pollinated, polycross progenies and selfed progenies of alfalfa have given equally good results as to the combining ability (57). It therefore seems to be of paramount importance to find as self sterile and as good combining open pollinated lines as possible in order to get the greatest hybrid vigor in double cross hybrids or in synthetic varieties.",

    "abstract": "Tutkimuksessa on yritetty selvittää karjanlannan fosforin koostumusta ja käyttökelpoisuutta. Analyysit on suoritettu etupäässä tekijän kehittämällä orgaanisen aineksen fosforin fraktioimismenetelmällä. Tutkimuksessa päädyttiin seuraaviin tuloksiin: 1. Meikäläisen karjanlannan fosforinpitoisuus on Maatalouskoelaitoksen maanviljelyskemian ja fysiikan osastolla vuosina 1930—47 tutkitun 310 näytteen mukaan keskimäärin 0.19 ± 0.06 % P2O5. Typpeä on keskimäärin 0.46 ± 0.10 % ja kalia 0.61 ± 0.20 %. 2. Eri eläinlajien tuoreista sontanäytteistä saadut fraktioinnin tulokset osoittivat niiden rehujen fosforin koostumuksen perusteella tehdyt johtopäätökset jotensakin oikeiksi. Märehtijöiden sonnassa oli 35—55 % fosforista epäorgaanisena, nukleiiniaineitten osuus saattoi kohota jopa yli 40 %:n. Hevosen ja sian sonnassa on 65—75 % epäorgaanista fosforia ja samoin suurin osa orgaanisesta fosforista nukleiiniaineina. Kanan sonnassa on noin 40 % fosforista epäorgaanisena ja hiukan enemmän fytiininä. Eri eläinlajeille ominainen sonnan pH ja kalsiuminpitoisuus kuvastuvat epäorgaanisen fosforin liukenevuussuhteista. 3. Palamisen aikana tapahtuvat lannan fosforiyhdistysten muutokset riippuvat oleellisesti siitä, onko orgaanisen fosforin määrä mineraloitumisen rajan ylä- vai alapuolella: kun lannassa on palamisen alussa vähemmän kuin 0.45 % orgaanista P2O5 (0.2 % P) kuiva-aineesta, on todennäköistä, että fosforin biologista pidättymistä on havaittavissa ainakin palamisen alkuvaiheessa. Naudan lannassa saavutetaan mineraloitumisen raja kuitenkin melko pian, vaikka olisi käytetty runsaastikin olkikuivikkeita. Hevosen sonnan fosfori on yleensä siksi paljon mineraloitumisen rajan alapuolella, että biologista pidättymistä on odotettavissa, kun lanta palaa ilman kuivikkeitakin. Turvepehkulla talteenotettua naudanlantaa voidaan käyttää palamattomana lannoitukseen ilman, että tarvitsee pelätä fosforin biologisen pidättymisen aiheuttavan maassa fosforin puutetta. Samoin on laita, kun olkikuivikkeita on käytetty alle 10 %. 4. Karjanlannan palaessa mineraloituu lähinnä sen veteen ja happoon liukenevaa orgaanista fosforia. Nukleiiniaineet eivät mineraloidu sanottavasti. Palamisen aikana on havaittavissa epäorgaanisen fosforin liukenevuuden huonontumista. 5. Superfosfaattina karjanlantaan lisättyä epäorgaanista fosforia pidättyy biologisesti palamisen aikana jonkin verran, mutta orgaaniseksi muuttuvan fosforin määrä on runsaastikin olkikuivikkeita käytettäessä siksi pieni, ettei sillä juuri ole merkitystä. Sen sijaan on selvästi havaittavissa, että monokaliumfosfaatti muuttuu vaikeammin liukeneviksi fosfaateiksi lannan pH:n kohotessa palamisen aikana. 6. Lannan palaessa anaerobisissa olosuhteissa sen fosforin mineraloituminen on kuiva-aineen häviöön nähden tehokkaampaa kuin aerobisesti palavassa. Typen häviöiden estämiseksi suositettu lannan tiiviinä säilyttäminen on siis edullista myös fosforitalouden kannalta. 7. Turvepehkulla talteenotetussa lannassa on suhteellisesti enemmän fosforia epäorgaanisena kuin lannassa, jonka talteenotossa on käytetty olkea. Turvepehkun happamuus näyttää parantavan epäorgaanisen fosforin liukenemista veteen. 8. Kolmessakymmenessä erilaisessa lantanäytteessä oli keskimäärin 60 % (30—72 %) fosforista epäorgaanisena, siitä noin puolet veteenliukenevana. Epäorgaanisen fosforin osuus oli yleensä sitä suurempi, mitä enemmän lannassa oh fosforia. Nukleiiniaineina oli keskimäärin 25 % (16—50 %), fosfatideina 1—2 % ja veteen liukenevana orgaanisena fosforina ja fytiininä yhteensä 10—20 %, paitsi kanan lannassa, jossa fytiininä oli vielä 20—25 %. 9. Karjanlannan fosforin käyttökelpoisuutta tarkasteltaessa kirjallisuudessa esitettyjen tietojen ja tässä tutkimuksessa saatujen tulosten perusteella todettiin, että palaneen karjanlannan fosforin arvo riippuu lähinnä sen epäorgaanisen fosforin osuudesta. Kokonaisfosforin pitoisuus kuvastaa jossain määrin lannan fosforin arvoa, koska epäorgaanisen fosforin osuus on yleensä sitä suurempi, mitä enemmän lannassa on fosforia kaikkiaan. Varmemman tuloksen saamiseksi voidaan määrittää epäorgaaninen fosfori käyttämällä uuttamiseen jotain 0.2—0.5 normaalista happoa.",

    "abstract": "The physiological effects of Pekilo microfungus biomass (Paecilomyces varioti) grown in sulphite spent liquor solution was studied in pigs. Sixteen Finnish landrace gilts weighing about 22 kg were divided into two groups of eight animals each. The animals were fed a barley- and oat-based diet supplemented with vitamins and minerals. The soybean and fish meal mixture used as a protein supplement for the control group was replaced with Pekilo at a level of 13 % of the feed weight in the experimental diet used up till farrowing. The experimental diet used during lactation contained 15 % of Pekilo. The feed consumption and weight gain of the animals were recorded. The experiment lasted almost one year and included the growth, gestation and lactation periods of the sows. The weight gain of the piglets was observed. After weaning of the litter the sows were analysed for blood haemoglobin, haematocrit and white blood cell count, plasma glucose, serum bilirubin, ASAT, ALAT, urea, uric acid, allantoin, total protein and albumin/globulin ratio. The allantoin, uric acid and creatinine contents of a single urine sample were determined quantitatively, and the pH, glucose and protein contents semiquantitatively. The urine density was measured. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to weight gain, feed consumption, feed efficiency and reproductive performance. Serum urea and plasma glucose levels were significantly lower in the Pekilo-fed group than in the control group but were within the normal limits for swine. The serum allantoin level and the urine allantoin/creatinine ratio of the Pekilo group were significantly above the control group values. No differences were found between the two groups in the other blood and urine analyses. The use of Pekilo biomass as protein supplement in the diet of breeding sows was found to have no detrimental effects as assessed on the basis of weight gain, feed consumption, feed efficiency, reproductive performance and certain blood and urine parameters.",

The control group received no extra carbohydrate feed. On the basis of the weekly milk samples from all test animals the polyol group had on an average the highest LP content (17.8 µg/ml), the lowest SCN- content (0.87 mg/l), and the lowest somatic cell count (152 000 cells/ml). The mean values for the molasses group were; LP: 12.6 µg/ml, SCN- ; 1.01 mg/ml and cell count: 626 000 cells/ml. The same values for the control group were 11,7 µg/ml, 0.91 mg/l and 285 000 cells/ml, respectively. The polyol group yielded milk with an average of 51.5 % more lactoperoxidase daily than the molasses group, and 42.5 % more than the control group. These differences were, however, not found to derive from the different carbohydrate diet, because no significant change in the LP level in any group occurred during the test feeding. The LP and SCN- contents varied considerably from one cow to the other. The degrees of correlation between the factors tested varied markedly among the test groups. The overall values for r were as follows: LP: SCN- = —0.049, LP: cell count = 0.222 and SCN-: cell count = 0.080. On the basis of cell content and the occurrence of mastitis cases, the polyol group had the best and the molasses group the worst udder health. The possible effect of the LP/SCN- /H2O2 antimicrobial system on mastitis resistance is evaluated.",

Several characteristics of the mutant are compared with those of cv. Hannes and the F1 generation of the backcross. The inheritance is monofactorially recessive. The F1 plants display a great heterosis of grain production. Evidence is presented regarding the temporary heterozygote advantage as the cause of the retention of the mutant in oat stands.",

    "abstract": "An econometric model for the Finnish egg industry was derived in this study to provide information concerning the impact of alternative price policies on the development of the egg industry for price policy analyses. The basic model specified in this study is an eight-equation model including distributed lag formulations and consisting of three different blocks. The basic assumption behind the model specification is that the price levels of eggs are mainly determined by the target price level (set up by the government) and the domestic market situation. Producers are assumed to respond to changes in the producer price of eggs and in the other factors influencing the profitability of egg production. The basic model was estimated on the basis of semiannual observations from period 1956-70. In addition, the stability of the coefficients of production equations in the model over the years was tested by using the stepwise regression method. The structure of the basic model was evaluated by means of deterministic simulations to gain some idea of the model’s ability to simulate the actual development of the egg industry. Both historical simulations and ex-post forecast simulations were conducted and the »goodness of fit» was tested by the use of Theil’s inequality coefficients and graphical examinations. The basic model was also used for analyzing the price policy pursued by the government in period 1956-70 in order to illustrate the type of analyses that can be conducted by the basic model. An alternative policy mix consisting of the target price system for maintaining the domestic market balance and the direct payment scheme for attaining the income target of producers was defined. Given the assumptions made in this study this policy mix would have been a more effective policy tool from the standpoint of society for attaining the policy goals than the target price system as implemented in that period. Similar conclusions can be also drawn from the results of the ex-post price policy simulations, in which the target price level was assumed to be used for adjusting the domestic egg production gradually to the domestic consumption. Also in this alternative the government was assumed to bear the burden of attaining the income target of producers in the system by the use of direct payments. However, we must point out that results depend on the assumptions necessary for computations of this type.",

The feed conversion rates for the period 1971—75 were estimated from the feed balance sheets which show the feed use for different animal production lines. They form the basis for the forescasts of the coefficients for 1975-85. Feed efficiency in milk production is expected to improve by 3 per cent from 0.837 to 0.811 feed units per litre of milk in ten years by 1985. This is a result of the increase of the average yields and average weight of cows; the proportion of the feed needed for the maintenance of the cow decreases. In beef production the feed efficiency is expected to worsen, from 12.0 to 13,8 feed units per kg due to the increase of average slaughter weights. If the slaughter weights do not rise as much as predicted (from 160 to 190 kg in ten years), the feed conversion rate will not increase as predicted. In pork production the feed efficiency is expected to improve from 5.28 to 4.77 feed units per kg and in broiler production from 4.00 to 3.60 feed units per kg. All values presented above are gross estimates, i.e. they include the waste in handling and feeding. The error of the coefficients may be several per cents but it cannot be specified. The possible error has to be kept in mind when the conversion rate estimates are applied.",

In some cases such as meat, butter and margarine the development of the consumption will depend largely on the future price policy and therefore the forecasts can be considered as alternatives which seem possible but which may also turn out to be wrong. Comsumption forecasts for wheat and rye are based on an income elasticity of —0.3. So the consumption of wheat will fall from46.2 kg per capita in 1975 to 40 kg in 1985 and the consumption of rye from 22.0 to 20kg per capita, respectively. Consumption of fluid milk is assumed to fall 10 per cent in 10 years and would be 206 kg per capita in 1985. The consumption of butter will depend on the price policy of butter in relation to margarine. If the ratio of the retail prices of these products remains as constant as it has been for some years, the consumption of butter is likely to be about 10 kg per capita in 1985. The cheese consumption is expected to increase annually by 4 per cent up to 8.5 kg per capita in 1985.The consumption of other dairy products will stay at the present level. The consumption of eggs will, on the other band, increase 20 per cent during the next 10 years. Beef and pork are close substitutes the consumption of which depends largely on the price policy. Since the supply of beef may not increase due to the declining number of dairy cows it is assumed that the retail price of beef will rise faster than that of pork and therefore the demand pressure on meat will shift to pork, the consumption of which expected to increase by 1kg per capita per year so that it will be 35 kg in 1985. The diet of 1985 is checked by calculating its energy, fat and protein content. The results seem to be rather acceptable.",

Alfalfa seeding densities of 50, 400 and 800 seeds/m2 were used to determine intraspecific competition. Interspecific competition between alfalfa and weeds occurred mainly in noncontrolled alfalfa stands at various levels of seeding densities. Plant competition was evaluated with importance values and with relative crowding coefficients. Both measurements were found to be suitable for this kind of study. Importance values primarily indicated the quantity relationships of different species. Relative crowding coefficients mainly characterized the competitive ability of a species in a mixed stand. The importance of alfalfa exceeded the importance of weeds in noncontrolled and herbicide controlled stands at the seeding rates of 14 and 7 kg/ha respectively. Relative crowding coefficients show the competitive ability of alfalfa with regard to weeds. In the case of intraspecific competition there was no change in the crowding coefficient of alfalfa in respect of weeds when the seeding rate of alfalfa was increased beyond 9 kg/ha. The crowding coefficient of weeds presented equal values under all treatments thereby indicating the variability and plasticity of weeds. The maximum yield level was obtained in all treatments with the alfalfa seeding rate of 9 kg/ha. The total biomass production per unit area was equal in the noncontrolled system at all seeding densities and in the herbicide controlled system at seeding rates of 9 kg/ha or more.",

The characteristics of the strain showed a close resemblance to Corynehacterium enzymicum, earlier considered to be derived only from human sources. The relatively low counts of the bacterium in the rumen and its relatively wide temperature range indicated that it is only a casual inhabitant of the rumen, an that its natural habitat is the soil, and hay or related materials. Since this finding is compatible with the corresponding conclusions of other authors as regards closely related corynebacteria, it can be presumed that those corynebacteria hitherto reported only from human sources may be more widely distributed in nature.",

Kortelajeista erityisesti E. palustre osoittautui vallankin nautakarjalle hyvän vahingolliseksi. Lehmät vieroksuvat suokortepitoisia rehuja, ja hyvinkin pienet määrät tätä kasvia aiheuttavat maidontuotannon vähenemistä. Ripulia, laihtumista ja yleiskunnon huononemista on myös todettu lehmillä, joille on annettu suokortepitoisia rehuja. Kansanomaisella nimellä mainittujen ruoste- tai ruovikaisten heinien todettiin kaikissa tutkimukseen sisältyneissä tapauksissa sisältäneen suokortteita. Niinikään olen jo aikaisemmin (15) esittänyt tietoja E. palustren levinneisyydestä maassamme. Ottaen huomioon E. palustren vahingollisuuden karjanruokinnassa, lienee syytä valottaa lähemmin tämän lajin esiintymisluonnetta myös luonnontilaisilla soilla. Kasvimaantieteellisessä kirjallisuudessa (1, 11, 12) on tosin tietoja lajin esiintymisestä eri suotyypeillä, mutta yksityiskohtaista ja tilastollisia selvittelyä ei tiettävästi ole ennen esitetty. Tämän tutkimuksen tarkoituksena on selvittää E. palustren esiintymistä eri suotyypeillä ja eri syvyisillä soilla sekä sen seuralaislajistoa. Tässä yhteydessä haluan esittää kiitokset professori MAUNO J. KOTILAISELLE, joka on työni aikana antanut monia arvokkaita neuvoja. Samoin hän on antanut erään julkaisemattoman tutkimuksensa aineistoa käytettäväkseni.",

Sen tarkoituksena oli saada kylvösiemenen hankinnan helpottamiseksi mahdollisimman tasapuolinen kuva kevätviljojen itävyydestä eri puolilla maatamme. Kasvukauden 1959 kuivuus suurimmassa osassa maatamme, etenkin Etelä- ja Länsi-Suomessa, aiheutti sen, että tutkimuksesta muodostui pääosaltaan tyypillinen poutakesän siementutkimus. Kun miltei sateettoman korjuukauden ansiosta siemensadon laatu osoittautui normaalia paremmaksi, antoi tutkimus viitteitä siitä, millaista siemensatoa maassamme voidaan saada edullisten sääsuhteiden vallitessa. Poikkeuksen edellä sanotusta muodostivat siemenerät sellaisilta seuduilta, joissa halla oli vieraillut kasvukauden aikana. Halla-alueen keskus sijaitsi Keski-Pohjanmaalla ulottuen lievempänä Etelä-Pohjanmaalle sekä Keski- ja Pohjois-Suomeen. Kasvukauden 1959 hallat olivat pääasiassa kevät- ja kesähalloja esiintyen ankarimpina kesäkuun ja heinäkuun lopulla. Orashallat, joita sattui myös Lounais-Suomessa, heikensivät satotuloksia, mutta eivät vaikuttaneet alentavasti siemenien itävyyteen. Siementilannetutkimus antoi osaltaan pohjaa ajankohtaisen kylvösiemen tilanteen selvittämiselle ja niille toimenpiteille, joita tarvittiin siemenen hankkimiseksi katoalueille. Samalla saatiin aineistoa poutakesän kevätviljasatoa edustavalle siementutkimukselle. Vastaisuutta varten saatiin tutkimuksesta sellainen kokemus, että yksityiskohtaisempien paikallisten tietojen saamiseksi tutkimusaineiston tulisi olla runsaampi ja mahdollisimman tasapuolisesti eri seutuja ja olosuhteita edustava.",

Tutkimuksen piiriin kuului yhteensä 17 pihattoa, jotka sijaitsivat Itä-Hämeen ja Uudenmaan läänin maanviljelysseuran alueella; lantanäytteitä analysoitiin kaikkiaan 54 kpl. Pihattojen lannassa säilytyksen aikana tapahtuvien muutosten seuraamiseksi otettiin näytteitä eri aikoina: syksyllä, keskitalvella, keväällä ja seuraavana syksynä kesän yli säilytetystä lannasta. Keskimääräiseksi analyysitulokseksi 54 lantanäytteestä saatiin: ‰ tuoreesta ‰ kuiva-aineesta ammoniumtyppeä (NH4-N) 1.3 ± 0.1; kokonaistyppeä (N) 6.2 ± 0.1, 25.5 ± 0.6; fosforihappoa (P2O5) 2.4 ± 0.1, 9.8 ± 0.5; kalia (KaO) 8.9 ± 0.2, 36.7 ± 1.2; C/N 18.6; pH tuoreesta 8.4. Verrattaessa näitä lukuja tavallisen lannan vastaaviin arvoihin todetaan, että pihattolannan kokonaistyppi = 1.3 kertainen, fosforihappo = 1.2 », kali = 1.5 ». Suuri kalipitoisuus on selitettävissä lähinnä lantaan pidättyneen virtsan vaikutukseksi. Myös typen talteenottamiseksi ovat olosuhteet pihatossa yleensä erittäin hyvät. Eri aikoina kerätyistä pihattolantanäytteistä edustivat selvästi parasta lantaa ne näytteet, jotka oli otettu yli kesän pihatossa säilytetystä lannasta. Tähän ryhmään kuuluvien 16 lantanäytteen keskimääräiseksi ravinnepitoisuudeksi saatiin N = 6,4 ‰, P2O5 = 2,9 ‰ ja K2O 10,5 ‰ tuoreessa lannassa. Maatumista oli tapahtunut myös huomattavasti, jota kuvaa alhainen C/N-suhde 15.8. Tuoreinta lantaa edustavassa näyteryhmässä oli C/N = 21.6. Lantanäytteitä otettiin myös pihattojen lantapatjan pinta- ja pohjaosasta. Koska lantapatja useimmiten jäi melko ohueksi, jouduttiin mainitut näytteet pystysuunnassa ottamaan liiaksi lähekkäin, joten mitään selviä eroja lantapatjan pinta- ja pohjaosasta otettujen näytteiden välillä ei esiintynyt. Eri ravinteiden keskinäiset suhteet parsinavetassa ja pihatossa tuotetussa lannassa näyttävät tämän tutkimuksen mukaan olevan suunnilleen samanlaiset. Ainoa vähäinen ero on kalimäärien kohdalla, ts. pihattolannassa on prosenttisesti enemmän kalia. On kuitenkin otettava huomioon, että myös typen ja fosforin määrät ovat selvästi kohonneet ja summittaisena yhteenvetona näyttää pihattolannan ravinteiden kokonaismäärä olevan ainakin 1.3 kertainen tavalliseen lantaan verrattuna.",

    "abstract": "The author gives a preliminary report of a more extensive investigation concerning the moisture and temperature conditions in orchard soil profiles (6). This report concerns the studies made at Koivula orchard in South-west Finland. The variation of subsoil moisture contents during the growing season in 1956 were measured by tensiometers (5. 4. 1. 3). Fig. 1 indicates the effect of surface mulching with straw as compared to the effect of a plain surface on the moisture tension at 70—80 cm. depth. The corresponding values in soils irrigated with a combined subsoil fertilizing and irrigation apparatus (8,9.) are given in Fig. 2 (plain soil) and in Fig. 3 (straw mulched soil). On the basis of the moisture contents of garden subsoils given in this paper it can be concluded that, in the relatively dry conditions of South-west Finland, four irrigation treatments (each corresponding to about 40 mm. of precipitation) are required for preventing the subsoil moisture tension from rising up to 700 mm. Hg in unmulched heavy clay soil (Fig. 2). The first treatment should be made during the latter part of June and the others at two-week intervals. Using straw mulcing, the corresponding moisture content of orchard subsoil can be preserved if two treatments (at the beginning and at the end of June) are used (Fig. 3). Straw mulching without irrigation (Fig. 1) prolonged the period of suitable moisture content of subsoil in spring for about two weeks and thus the dry period under straw cover continued for only about six weeks. On the contrary, the dry period under the plain surface commenced at the beginning of July and was still continuing at the beginning of October. Because of the climatic conditions on Finland the growing season is very short, thus limiting the growth of plants. In addition, the plants usually suffer from droght during the warmest part of the growing season. Thus in our conditions the soils should not be drained too intensively in the spring, but conservation and increase of the soil moisture content during the summer months seems to be beneficial, especially in orchard soils. Because of the varying climatic conditions during different growing seasons systematical studies concerning moisture conditions in orchard soils should be planned.",

Heiniä annetaan kuitenkin niin paljon kuin vasikat haluavat syödä. Samoin vettä vasikat saavat pienestä pitäen juoda halunsa mukaan. Tässä järjestelmässä täysimaidon kulutus vasikkaa kohden on noin 270 kg, kuoritun maidon noin 860 kg ja väkirehun kuuden kuukauden ikään mennessä noin 68 kg. Rehunkulutuksen ja veden käytön selvittämiseksi järjestettiin tarkkailu 17 vasikalla (taulukot 2 ja 3). Vasikoitten syömä heinämäärä oli kuuden kuukauden ikään mennessä keskimäärin 310 kg. Syöty heinämäärä näytti tuskin lainkaan riippuvan vasikan syntymäpainosta ja sukupuolesta. Heinä oli timoteivaltaista timoteiapilaa. Vasikoitten syömä kuiva-ainemäärä 100 elopainokiloa kohti oli 4—6 kuukauden iässä 2.5—2.6 kg, nuoremmilla vasikoilla se oli pienempi. Vettä vasikat rupesivat juomaan jo lähipäivinä syntymän jälkeen. Neljän kuukauden ikäisillä vasikoilla juomaveden määrä oli keskimäärin yli puolet kulutetun kokonaisveden määrästä, vaikka vasikat saivat 9 kg kuorittua maitoa päivittäin. Vasikoitten saama rehuyksikkömäärä on yleensä hieman pienempi ja sulavan raakavalkuaisen määrä on suunnilleen yhtä suuri kuin ruotsalaisten, norjalaisten ja brittiläisten normien mukaiset määrät. Elopainon ja säkäkorkeuden kehitys vasikoilla ja hiehoilla on osoittautunut riittäväksi, jos kasvutuloksia verrataan kirjallisuudessa esitettyihin hyvissä ruokintaolosuhteissa saavutettuihin tuloksiin. Kuuden kuukauden iässä lehmävasikoitten elopaino oli keskimäärin 157 kg ja säkäkorkeus 98 cm. Hiehojen paino oli yhden vuoden iässä keskimäärin 243 kg ja 1 ½ vuoden iässä 327 kg ja säkäkorkeus yhden vuoden iässä keskimäärin 110 cm ja 1 ½ vuoden iässä 118 cm. Standardiruokinnan aikana vasikat ovat pysyneet erinomaisen terveinä ja hiehoina ne ovat kehittyneet hyvin. Hiehoina ovat standardiruokinnalla olleet eläimet yleensä tiinehtyneet hyvin, samoin myös lehminä nykyiseen ajankohtaan kertyneen tilaston mukaisesti.",

Värjäysmenetelmä on osoittautunut korsiviljojen siementen itävyyden määrityksessä useiden tutkimusten mukaan (2, 4, 5, 8) epätyydyttäväksi ja käytäntöön vaikeasti sovellutettavaksi. Tätä menetelmää onkin nykyisin keskitytty soveltamaan vain eräiden vaikeasti idätettävien siementen itävyyden selvittämiseen. Selostettavaa työtä varten lähetti Wienin siementarkastuslaitoksen edustaja, tohtori HERMANN GERM, vuoden 1954 alussa siemennäytteitä yhdeksään maahan, kymmeneen eri siementarkastuslaitokseen. Lähetys käsitti kymmenen siemenerää, joihin sisältyi 6 siemenlajia. Näytteiden itävyyden tarkastusohjeet seurasivat mukana. Kasvilajit (ks. taul. s. 144), joiden siemeniä tutkittiin, olivat seuraavat: Carpinus betulus L. (näyte 1), Fraxinus excelsior L. (näytteet 2 ja 3), Prunus Myrobalana L. (näytteet 4 ja 5), Pirus communis L. (näytteet 6 ja 7), Rosa canina L. (näyte 8) ja Tilia grandifolia Ehrhart (näytteet 9 ja 10). Kansainvälisen siementarkastusliiton nykyisten sääntöjen (7) mukaan tetrazolium-menetelmää voidaan käyttää kaikkien em. kasvilajien siementen itävyyden määrittämiseen",

    "abstract": "Syksyllä 1957 korjatussa viljasadossa oli sen itämiskykyä arvostellen yleisimpinä vikoina korjuukauden sateisuudesta aiheutuneet vesivahingot, jotka olivat luonteeltaan joko suoranaisia (itäneisyys) tai välillisiä (homeisuus ja kuivausvioitukset). Muita vikoja (hallavauriot sekä alkion särkyneisyys) esiintyi suhteellisen vähän. Itäneisyyttä ilmeni runsaimmin syys- ja kevätvehnässä sekä rukiissa. Kaksitahoisen ohran itäneisyys oli runsaampaa kuin monitahoisen. Kaura kärsi tähkäidännästä kaikkein vähimmin. Homeisuus oli niinikään yleisintä syys- ja kevätvehnässä sekä rukiissa. Kaurassa oli homeen tartuntaa enemmän kuin ohrissa. Kuivausvaurioita todettiin runsaimmin kevät- ja syysvehnissä. Kaurassa ne olivat yleisempiä kuin ohrassa. Rukiissa esiintyi kuivausvioituksia vain vähän. Puinnista ja käsittelystä johtunutta jyvän alkioiden särkyneisyyttä oli enimmän monitahoisessa ohrassa, vähemmän kaksitahoisessa ohrassa sekä kaurassa. Jyvän palasia sisältäneitä näytteitä oli runsaimmin rukiilla, vähemmän kevät- ja syysvehnällä. Hallavaurioita todettiin vain vähän kaurassa sekä kevätvehnässä. Tähkäidäntä alensi viljojen lopullista itävyyttä suhteellisen vähän ja vähemmän kuin muut siemenien viat. Enimmän tähkäidäntä heikensi itävyyttä syys- ja kevätvehnällä, senjälkeen kauralla, ohrilla ja rukiilla. Jyvien alkioiden särkyminen alensi itävyyttä enemmän kuin tähkäidäntä. Itävyyden heikentyminen oli suurinta monitahoisella ohralla, vähän pienempää kauralla sekä kaksitahoisella ohralla. Kylvösiemenen primaariset homeet heikensivät itävyyttä edellisiä enemmän. Itävyyden alentuminen oli voimakkainta rukiilla, senjälkeen kaksitahoisella ohralla, syys- ja kevätvehnällä, kauralla sekä monitahoisella ohralla. Kuivausvioitusten merkitys viljan itävyyden alentajana oli sateisen korjuukauden vuoksi erityisen suuri. Kuivausvirheet alensivat itävyyttä edellä esitettyjä voimakkaammin. Eniten alentui itävyys tästä syystä rukiilla, sitten vehnillä sekä ohrilla ja vähiten kauralla. Hallan aiheuttamat vauriot alensivat itävyyttä enemmän kuin muut itävyyteen vaikuttaneet tekijät. Hallavioitukset, joita todettiin vain kevätvehnässä ja kaurassa, olivat ankarampia ensin mainitussa viljassa.",

Lehmillä suoritettiin kaksi koetta, 30 päivän (koe I) ja 75 päivän (koe II) pituiset. Kokeessa I saivat lehmät laitumella vapaasti erikseen rehusuolaseosta I ja ruokasuolaa, joita ne söivät edellistä keskimäärin 35 g/p ja jälkimmäistä 30 g/p eläintä kohti, saaden tällöin Ca 9.5 g/p, P 3.0 g/p ja NaCl 31 g/p. Kokeessa II oli lehmillä tarjolla rehusuolaseosta I, rehusuolaseosta II, magnesiaseosta, luujauhoja ja ruokasuolaa. Lehmät söivät kolmea ensiksimainittua suunnilleen samaa tasoa olevia määriä (keskimäärin 10 g, 14 g, 10 g/p eläintä kohti). Niiden yhteismäärä vastaa jokseenkin kokeessa I rehusuolaseoksen I, joka oli ainoana seoksena, kulutusta. Rehuluujauhoja söivät eläimet edellisiä halukkaammin (keskimäärin 42 g/p eläintä kohti). Erityisen halukkaasti ne söivät niitä ensimmäisen 30 p:n koejakson aikana, osittain ehkä jonkun kivennäisaineen vajauksen vuoksi taikka osittain ehkä uutuuttaan. Kokeeseen I verrattuna söivät lehmät kokeessa II luujauhot ylimääräisenä määränä, mistä johtuen ovat syödyt Ca- ja P-määrät (20.7 g/p ja 8.6 g/p eläintä kohti) kokeessa II yli kaksinkertaiset. Luujauhot ovat sopivia kivennäisainelisäksi laidunruokinnalla. Ruokasuolan kulutus oli hieman suurempi kokeessa II (38 g/p), kuin kokeessa I (31 g/p). Magnesiumia söivät lehmät magnesiaseoksen magnesiumkarbonaattilisässä keskimäärin 0.23 g/p ja luujauhoissa 0.31 g/p. (Dolomiitti sisältää myös Mg). Laidunhalvausta ei esiintynyt karjassa kokeen aikana, eikä myöskään ennen Mg-lisän antamista. Hiehoilla suoritettu koe oli 40 päivän pituinen. Niille oli tarjolla rehusuolaseosta I, rehuluujauhoja ja ruokasuolaa. Rehusuolaseosta I eivät hiehot syöneet tuskin ollenkaan (3 g/p eläintä kohti). Sensijaan luujauhoa ne söivät erittäin halukkaasti (78 g/p eläintä kohti). Myös ruokasuolaa ne söivät runsaasti (52 g/p eläintä kohti). Syöty Ca-määrä oli 23.2 g/p ja P 10.8 g/p eläintä kohti. Määrät ovat suuremmat kuin lypsylehmien kummassakaan kokeessa keskimäärin syömät määrät. Se johtuu ilmeisesti toisaalta siitä, että hiehojen syömä laidunrehumäärä on pienempi kuin täysikasvuisen lehmän, jolloin rehussa saamat kivennäismäärät jäävät vähäisemmiksi ja toisaalta siitä, että kasvavan hiehon kivennäisaineitten tarve on verrattain suuri tiineyden loppupuolella. Luujauhot ovat hiehoille sopivia kivennäisainelisäksi laitumella.",

Pensasmustikan viljely on varminta maan eteläisellä rannikkoseudulla. Myös pohjoisemmassa saattaa kasvi menestyä, mutta marjojen valmistuminen on siellä epävarmaa. Maassamme ilmenee pensasmustikassa versosyöpätautia, jonka aiheuttaja on Fusicoccum putrefaciens Shear. Jersey-lajikkeessa esiintyy tautia runsaimmin, kun taas Rancocas ja Rubel ovat suhteellisen kestäviä. Tauti vähenee, jos sairaat versot poistetaan ja pensaita ruiskutetaan syksyllä.

June-lajikkeessa on todettu virustaudin kaltaista vikaa, joka oireiltaan poikkeaa muissa maissa todetuista pensasmustikan virustaudeista.

    "abstract": "In Finnish agriculture the postwar years have shown a marked decrease in the development of the average yield per hectare, as compared with the trend in the prewar period. Between the five-year periods 1921—25 and 1935—39, the yield per hectare increased more than 27 per cent, the equivalent increase from the latter period to 1950—54 being only one per cent. This slow increase in the yield is all the more notable when we consider that the quantities of fertilization at the same time rose by 380 per cent per hectare while the increase during the last decade before the war was only 40 per cent. The present study tries to point out the effects of the changes in temperature on this yield development. The earlier studies – which have dealt with the dependency of the yield upon climatic factors in Finland – have shown that the condition of temperature is the factor to which the yields in our circumstances are correlated most closely. In addition to the average temperature in May—August, the volume of fertilization was taken as a second explanatory variable. The partial correlation coefficient between the fertilization volume and the average yield showed during the periods of 1921—39 and 1948—54 a value r12∙3 = 0.76, while the corresponding value of the temperature and yield was r13∙2 = 0.65. The coefficient of the multiple correlation was R1∙23 = 0.82. By using the regression analysis it was found that the coefficient of determination rose when describing the dependency of the yield on the explantory variables in question by an exponential function. Sh = aX1 b2 ∙ X2 b2 ; Sh = volume of the yield per hectare X1 = quantity of fertilization input per hectare X2 = average temperature of May—August a1, b1, b2 = parameters. By the method of the least squares the elasticity coefficients b1 and b2 appeared to be; b1 = 0.097 ± 0.011 and b2 = 0.647 ± 0.121. These elasticities do not give a true picture about the relative explanatory abilities of the two variables because their standard deviations are quite different. The values of the beta-coefficients are in this case respectively 0.76 and 0.47. The coefficient of multiple correlation of the model is R = 0.90. The model is illustrated by a diagram on page 214. The analysis points out the notable economic effects of the changes in temperature in Finnish agriculture. The fact that the average temperature of the summers during 1948—54 remained about 1.2 C° lower than during 1934—39, seems, according to the study, broadly speaking to have eliminated the effect of the big increase in the fertilization volume and the effects of the agricultural advancement.",

    "abstract": "Die Wirkung des Übergehens zum Laufstallsystem auf die Möglichkeiten zur Beurteilung der Produktionsneigungen der Kühe wurde bei 129 zu 36 Herden gehörenden Kühen untersucht, für die ganzjährige Leistungsangaben aus wenigstens zwei dem Übergangsjahr vorausgegangenen Kontrolljahren der Warmstallzeit und aus wenigstens zwei Jahren der darauffolgenden Laufstallzeit verfügbar gewesen waren. Die Untersuchung erfolgte durch Berechnen des Anteils der zwischen den Individuen bestehenden Varianz an der Gesamtvarianz sowohl der relativen Milchleistungen als der relativen Fettgehalte gesondert für die im Warmstall und für die im Laufstall erzielten Leistungen der regelmässigen Jahre. Die Milchleistungen wurden durch Koeffizienten auf den Leistungsstand 9jähriger Tiere ausgeglichen. Das Alter der Kühe belief sich im Übergangsjahr durchschnittlich auf 8.6 Jahre, wobei die jüngste 5 und die älteste 15 Jahre alt war. Im Warmstall wechselte das Alter zwischen 3 und 14 und im Laufstall zwischen 6 und 19 Jahren. Der Anteil der zwischen den einzelnen Tieren bestehenden Varianz an der Gesamtvarianz der Milchleistungen betrug im Warmstall 52.3 und im Laufstall 53.8 % und entsprechend an der Gesamtvarianz des Fettgehaltes im Warmstall 63.9 und im Laufstall 71.7 %, so dass der Übergang zum Laufstall die Beurteilungsmöglichkeiten für die Leistungen der Kühe wenigstens nicht verschlechtert hat. Der Anteil der regelmässigen Jahre – mit anderen Worten, der Jahre, in denen das Tier gesund gewesen ist und in Zwischenraumen von höchstens 15 Monaten gekalbt hat – an allen Jahren belief sich beim Warmstall auf 95.3 ± 1.1 und beim Laufstall auf 96.7 ± 1.0. Da das durchschnittliche Alter der Kühe beim Warmstall 6.8 und beim Laufstall 10.6 Jahre betrug, kann die Regelmässigkeit beim Laufstall als sehr gut angesehen werden. Bei den Altersklassen 8—12, zu denen Tiere sowohl in der Warmstall- als in der Laufstallzeit gehören, war die Regelmässigkeit im Laufstall um 6.1 ± 2.6 Prozenteinheiten besser als im Warmstall. Aus den Ergebnissen kann wohl geschlossen werden, dass das Übergehen zum Laufstallsystem die Möglichkeiten der Zuchtwahl gegenüber dem Warmstallsystem nicht erschwert, sondern eher vielleicht verbessert. Die Rangfolge einer und derselben Tiere kann im Laufstall eine andere als im Warmstall sein. Bei den untersuchten Herden ist der Leistungsstand im Laufstall derselbe wie im Warmstall geblieben.",

The temperature of air as well as soil had been largely the same on both sites during the period of development, from the coming into ear to the ripening.

Aus diesem Grunde wird vorgeschlagen, das endgültige Zugergebnis von mehrmals in Versuchen gewesenen Pferden als Mittelwert aller Proben zu berechnen. Weil die prozentuale Zugfähigkeit bei zunehmendem Alter der Pferde unverändert zu bleiben scheint, wird vorgeschlagen, die Zugwiderstände der verschiedenen Stufen nach denselben Grundlagen wie für verschieden alte Pferde zu berechnen. Durch Berechnung nach den prozentualen Zugergebnissen der wenigstens in drei Zugversuchen gewesenen Pferde wird die Grösse der Heritabilität der Zugfähigkeit auf Grund der innerhalb der Klasse bestehenden Korrelation auf 0.17 geschätzt.",

Diese Soja-Sorten erwiesen sich als annähernd tagneutral (Tabelle 1).

Maan leipäviljaomavaraisuus on huomattavasti heikentynyt erityisesti 1950-luvulla ja sekä rukiin että vehnän tuontitarve on lisääntynyt. Jotta Suomi olisi rukiissa omavarainen, voitaisiin rukiin viljelyalaa lisätä n. 70 000 ha:lla. Jotta taas vehnässä saavutettaisiin 75 % omavaraisuus, voitaisiin vehnän viljelyalaa lisätä n. 100 000 ha:lla. Ohran viljelyala on 1950-luvulla voimakkaasti kasvanut johtuen sen aikaisesta tuleentumisesta ja viljelyvarmuudesta muihin kevätviljoihin verrattuna. Kauran viljelylaajuus on ollut sama kuin muiden viljalajien yhteensä. Vuosina 1950 ja 1955 on selvitetty eri vilja- ja hernelajikkeiden levinneisyyttä Suomessa (taul. 2). Vilja- ja hernealasta oli 1955 Tammiston jalosteiden kasvussa 52 %, Svalövin jalosteiden osuus oli 23 %, Jokioisten 8 % ja Weibullsholmin 7 %. Rehukasvien viljelyssä ei ole tapahtunut merkittäviä muutoksia. Tärkeimmän palkokasvin, puna-apilan, siementuotannossa on ollut suuria vaikeuksia. Laidunheinistä on nurminadan ja koiranheinän merkitys lisääntynyt. Teollisuuskasveista on sekä syysrypsiä että sokerijuurikasta viljelty n. 17 000 ha:n alalla (kuva 1 ja 2).",

Näitä koeobjekteina käyttäen vertailtiin eri säilöntäaineiden tehoa Czapekin mediumissa ja vierteessä pH 4.55:ssä ja pH 7:ssä tarkoitukseen kehitetyllä paperikiekkomenetelmällä. Säilöntäaineiden tehokkuusjärjestys oli pH 4.55:ssä dehydroetikkahappo > K5-vitamiini > heksametylentetramiini > sorbiinihappo ≈ p-oksibentsoehapon etylesteri > bentsoehappo ja pH 7:ssä K5 - vitamiini > p-oksibentsoehapon etylesteri ≈ heksametylentetramiini > dehydroetikkahappo > sorbiinihappo > bentsoehappo.

The sawdust has shown a very marked beneficial effect on the rooting of the shoots. More than twice as much well rooted shoots have been obtained from the sawdust blocks than from those stooled with soil. The sawdust treatment has given more roots per shoot. Moreover the rooted portion of the shoot as well as the total length of the roots in the shoots has been higher by using the sawdust stooling. The weight of the roots per shoot has been in sawdust bed twice of that grown in soil bed. The differences in the rooting quality of the shoots are obviously in the main due to better moisture conditions inside the sawdust than in the soil cover.",

The method was developed at the University Farm at Viik in 1954, and based on two centrifugation methods employed earlier. The main attention was paid to the taking of the sample and its fast handling, because the heterogeneous nature of the material demands even in the case of one sample the examination of a considerably large number of heads. The secretion of nectar and sugar was more abundant in the large heads than in the small-sized ones so that for the obtaining of realiable data with a moderate number of heads the sample should be composed of heads of as near the same size (medium size) as possible. The shortening of the corollas by cutting before centrifugation proved unnecessary at least where sufficiently large glass tubes were employed. By changing the method of fastening the inflorescences and the form of the glass tube, and by inserting a metal gauze at the bottom of the capillary tube the clean nectar was easily directed into the capillary tube (Figs. 1 and 2).",

The average increases for the test and control group, respectively, were: live weight 14.45 kg/6.48 kg, length 9.33 cm/3.33 cm, chest circumference 6.50 cm/4.33 cm, height of withers 1.8 cm/1.2 cm, pelvic breadth at the tubera coxae 1.7 cm/0.7 cm. Serum calcium and copper fell and potassium rose in the material as a whole. There were no statistically significant differences between the test and control groups except in Na, which rose in the test and fell the control groups. In view of the small size of each group and the nevertheless nearly significant difference in average weights (0.05 &lt; P &lt; 0.1), it would seem that aureomycin additive in the feed was beneficial for the heifers in these conditions. Economic consiferations will decide whether it is generally advisable to resort to aureomycin additive.

Puhtausvirheistä olivat yleisimpiä runsas toisten hyötykasvien siemenien sekä roskien määrä. Tutkituista viljoista oli kauran puhtaus selvästi huonompi kevätvehnän ja ohran puhtautta. Itävyysvirheistä olivat tärkeimpiä hallavioittumat (etenkin kauralla ja ohralla), tuleentumattomuus (etenkin kauralla), itäneisyys (etenkin kevätvehnällä), homeisuus (kaikilla viljoilla), puintivioitukset (etenkin ohralla ja kevätvehnällä) sekä kuivausvioitukset (etenkin kevätvehnällä).

Havainnot tutkitulla siemenellä kylvettyjen peltojen orastumisesta sekä arviot saaduista satotuloksista osoittivat myös puolestaan, että käytetyn kotoisen kylvösiemenen laatu oli ollut monessa suhteessa puutteellista.",

In den meisten Blattrübenversuchen (Tab. 2) stiegen die Zuckererträge ebenfalls über 1 000 kg/ha. Die grossen Unterschiede im Zuckerertrag sind auf die Schwankungen der Trockensubstanzerträge, des Blattanteils und des Zuckergehalts zurückzuführen.

    "abstract": "In 1955 the Department of Plant Pathology set to work, on Professor E. A. Jamalainen’s iniative, to study serologically the occurrence and distribution of potato viruses X and S in Finland and their prevalence in different potato varieties. In 1955 determinations of potato leaf material were made by Mr. A. B, R. BEEMSTER of the Institute for Phytopathological Research at Wageningen, Holland, who worked in the Department of Plant Pathology in August-October 1955. He analysed serologically leaves of potato plants, of which 450 samples had been collected from different potato experiments, the rest. 100 samples, coming ’from farmers’ fields. In the period of growth in 1956, the serological determinations were continued, and in addition a great number of visual observations of potato virus diseases were made on the basis of symptoms. A total of 650 potato plants were analysed; one half the plants coming from different potato experiments and the other half from farmers’ fields, althogether from 79 communes. The serological virus determinations were made in accordance with the agglutination method. The needed antisera and normal sera had been received from Holland (Laboratorium voor Bloembollenonderzoek). Table 1, p. 104 shows the occurrence of virus S and virus X in different parts of the country in 1955—56. It appears that viruses S and X are rather prevalent in the whole of Finland wherever potato is grown. According to the data in Table 1 it is possible to conclude that in Finland virus S would be to some extent more common than virus X. In fact the contrary appears to be true. In the studied material there was a great deal of the Jaakko potato variety, which was heavily infected by virus S. This variety is, indeed, comparatively little cultivated in Finland. Instead, the Eigenheimer variety, which is by far the most commonly cultivated potato in this country (18), is very much infected by virus X (Table 2, p. 105). Fields completely infected by virus X and virus S are very common in Finland. Nearly all the examined potato fields were at least partly infected either by both of these viruses or by one of them. Only 10 % of the studied 105 fields were without virus infection according to serological determinations and visual observations. The losses caused by potato Crincle mosaic are, according to observations, mostly slight or moderate in Finland. They are very common in the southern and southwestern parts of Finland and in the coastal region of South-Ostrobothnia (West Finland). Information concerning the general losses caused by potato Crincle mosaic in Finland is not available. According to the work of BRUMMER (2), the slight type of Crinkle mosaic lowered the yields by 22 % and the more severe type by 64 %. Rugose mosaic caused by a combination of X and Y viruses occurs mostly in isolated cases in South Finland. Streak and Rugose caused by virus Y, which was determined on the basis of the symptoms, has been found in Finland only in isolated cases in the southern parts of the country. The spreading of virus Y Rugose in Finland may be connected with the prevalence of the virus spreading aphids. Fields totally infected by virus Y have not been found. Even in the badly infected potato fields only 5—15 % of the plants proved to be infected with virus Y. Potato Leaf roll seems of minor significance in Finland as has earlier been established by JAMALAINEN (6). This disease was, however, abundant in 1956 on some Local Experimental Stations, though mainly on the Dore and Saskia potato varieties, which, being imported from abroad, were probably already infected. Table 2 p. 105 presents a summary of the serologically determined virus X and virus S on different potato varieties. Those varieties, of which a number of samples had been received from different parts of the country, proved to be, according to the serological determinations, approximately similarly infected by viruses throughout the country. The Jaakko potato variety proved very heavily infected by virus S; virus X, on the other hand, was less to be found. Virus S occurred in the Jaakko variety almost latent; the leaves were only slightly convex between the veins. Virus X was abundant on the Eigenheimer potato variety. Virus S was also relatively abundant in this variety. The same applies to the Rosafolia potato variety, which is the most cultivated variety in Finland after Eigenheimer. Varieties belonging to groups of the miscellaneous and unknown potato varieties were also particularly virus infected; the cultivated area of these is even larger than that of Eigenheimer (18). It was interesting also to establish that the country potato variety Hettula, cultivated only in North Finland, was severely infected by virus S and virus X. In the Hettula variety, as in many other varieties, viruses X and S could be simultaneously latent in the same plant. The newer potato varieties cultivated in Finland, such as Siikli and Akvila, were only slightly infected by viruses. The Akvila variety was, however, at a Carelian Local Experimental Station, very heavily infected by virus X.",

Eine 14tägige Kaltbehandlung (+ 1°C) war zu kurz, um das Keimen von Mutterkörnem zu verursachen. Die Einwirkung von Frostbehandlung (abwechselnd + 1°C und— 15.8°C) auf das Keimen von Mutterkörnern war negativ. Eine 34tägige Kaltbehandlung (+ 1°C) steigerte das Keimen von Sklerotien des deutschen Mutterkornstammes (D1) mehr als von denen des finnischen (F) (Tabelle 1; Abb. 1). Die überjährigen, im Laboratoriumsraum verwahrten Sklerotien des deutschen (D1) Mutterkornstammes waren im allgemeinen nicht keimfähig.

    "abstract": "A detailed description of the plant cover of the bog region in question has been given by LINDBERG (13), while its geological aspects have been treated by RINDELL (6). The peat of the test area is forest sedge peat and the bog type prior to clearing was wooded swamp with herbs and grasses. The chemical qualities of the peat adjacent to the test areas have been illustrated by RINDELL. These results are found in detail in the publication by VESIKIVI (8, p. 32). It may be mentioned in this connection that the CaO of the soil layer 20 cm in height has been 5858 kg per hectare, corresponding thus to the CaO content of nearly 12 tons of ground limestone. The test begun in 1908 was established by A. RINDELL and E. F. SIMOLA, and the test started in 1932 by A. VESIKIVI. The tests have been conducted by E. F. SIMOLA (1908—1917), E. A. MALM (1918—1919), A. VESIKIVI (1920—1943), J. TÖRMÄ (1944), and U. E. HIRVENSALO (1945—1946). The question of liming on fen at the Leteensuo Experimental Station is studied in the following on the basis of two prolonged liming tests. Liming test No. 1. – The test area had been cleared for cultivation and provided with wooden drains of square cross-section in 1904. The phosphate and potassium fertilizing had been annual, the phosphate fertilizing being equivalent to about 200—300 kg superphosphate and the potassium fertilizing to 100—200 kg 50 % potassium salt per hectare. Mineral soil had not been used as a soil improvement material. The limings were performed according to plan four times (0, 1000, 2000, 3000 kg slaked lime per hectare) that is in 1907, 1911, 1920, and 1940. Liming test No 2. – The test area had been cleared for cultivation in 1904. The following year sand had been given in a quantity of 400 m3 per hectare as soil improvement material. Cultivation had begun the same year. The liming test was arranged as late as 1932 when the liming was performed according to plan (0, 1000, 2000, and 3000 kg slaked lime per hectare). The annual fertilizing had been similar to that of the preceding test. TUORILA (7) has studied the changes in soil acidity resulting from the liming in the test begun in 1908. The pH-figure was 4.9 without lime and 5.25, 5.55, and 6.35 with increasing liming. Crop yield results The weather conditions of the test years have been described in a previous publication (PESSI 5). The annual crop yield results of the test can be seen in Tables I and II in the Appendix. Treating the test results in addition to the annual mean values, the significant crop yield differences are counted only if the F-value has at least one asterisk. Grass ley Tables 1 and 2 show the average annual crop yields. The grass crops have been timothy-dominated. The results show that liming has neither increased nor decreased the crop yields. On the sedge peat bog at Ruukki, on the other hand, where the lime content of the soil before the fertilizing and liming test was about 4500 kg CaO per hectare, liming has increased the crop yields (2, p. 14). Cereals Table 3 and Figure 1 show the average annual yield results of oats and barley. It is noticeable that liming has decreased the grain yields of oats in the same way as in the experiment at Ruukki (2, p. 16). On the other hand liming has neither increased nor decreased the grain yield of barley. Root crops Table 4 and Figure 2 show the yields of root crops. It can be seen that lower liming quantities have increased the root yields of sugar beet while the highest liming quantity has decreased it. On the root yields of swede and turnip liming has had no particular effect. Peculiar to the yields of tops of all root crops is that liming has lowered them. Quality of the yield Studies dealing with the quality of yield are scarce. From a space of two years there exist only the analyses of the sugar content of sugar beet. In 1924 the sugar content was 15.6 % in the treatment without lime and 15.6, 15.6, and 14.4 % when the quantity of lime was increased. In 1932 the corresponding numbers were 16.7, 14.0, 14.8, and 16.0 %. Thus liming has not had a significant effect on the sugar content. Conclusions On fen the peat of which is forest sedge peat and where in a soil layer 20 cm in height the CaO has been nearly 6000 kg per hectare, the effect of liming has varied depending on the test plant. The timothy-dominated grass ley, the grain yield of barley, and the root yields of swede and turnip have not been influenced by liming in a high degree. The root yields of sugar beet are increased by liming although the top quantity of lime has a lowering effect. The grain yield of oats is distinctly decreased by liming. The yields of root crop tops decrease with an increase in the liming.",

    "abstract": "The dry summer and the subsequent severe winter have again caused considerable damage to fruit farming in our country. In order to obtain an idea of the extent and type of damage in the various parts of the country, a questionnaire was distributed, jointly with the Fruit Farmers’ Association, to 717 fruit farmers. In the questionnaires, of which 171 were returned with sufficiently complete information, answers were requested as to the number of trees of various species which had passed the winter without any injury whatsoever, as well as of the damaged and dead trees. Information was further requested relating to soil, character of the terrain, treatment of the soil on the fruit farm, etc. The material thus obtained for scrutiny consisted of 45.000 apple-trees. Certain data on pear, plum, and cherry-trees were also obtained. The answers were grouped so as to constitute 10 more or less natural hibernation regions which can be seen from the accompanying map. The hibernation of apple-trees in the different regions has been detailed in tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Tables 9, 10, 11 and 12 show how apple-trees have stood the winter under different conditions of character of terrain and soil quality, and on grass land or upon bare soil. The data on the stocks have been compiled in tables 13 and 14. The study of the present material reveals that the varieties Kaneli and Sokeri-Miron have to be considered the most hardy ones among the varieties which are more commonly cultivated in our country. On the other hand, Oranie, Signe Tillisch, Linda and Wealthy would be most easily damaged among our standard varieties. The influence of the stocks has not had any decisive significance in regard to the hibernation of the trees this time. However, it was found, e.g., at the Research Institute at Piikkiö that Åkerö and Melba trees have borne up better in the stock test on M II than, for instance, on M IV and Normandie stocks. The character of the soil and its conditions of slope, again, have had a very marked influence upon the extent of damage.",

Tul., aus infizierten Roggenbeständen in die in deren unmittelbarer Nähe gelegenen Roggenkulturen war da am stärksten (29 —42 St./m2), wo die infizierten Pflanzen so weit reichten, dass sie den Bestand der Kultur berührten. Schon in 1—10 m Entfernung von der infizierten Fläche bildeten sich bedeutend weniger Mutterkörner (Tabelle I). War die Entfernung noch grösser, so verminderte sich der Mutterkornbefall, war aber in den randlichen Teilen der Roggenkultur noch reichlicher als in ihren mittleren Teilen. Die Anzahl der Mutterkörner je befallene Ähre belief sich bei drei untersuchten Mutterkornkulturen im Mittel auf. 5.3 St. Ausserhalb des infizierten Gebietes, in Wirtschaftskulturen von Roggen, war der entsprechende Betrag 1.6 St. (Tabelle 2). Mutterkörner gab es je infizierte Ähre etwas mehr in den randlichen als in den mittleren Teilen der Roggenkultur. Dagegen war die Anzahl der Mutterkörner nicht nennenswert davon abhängig, in welcher Entfernung vom infizierten Roggen die Pflanze wuchs. In den Jahren 1953—1955 verminderte eine künstliche Mutterkorninfektion den Kornertrag des Roggens Ensi auf 23—77 % (Tabelle 5). Die Herabsetzung des Ertrages beruhte nicht allein auf der offensichtlichen Verringerung der Körnerzahl, sondern auch darauf, dass die Körner der infizierten Ähren leichter als die der gesunden Ähren waren (Tabelle 3); im J, 1952 betrug der Unterschied 17.6 %. Der Kornertrag des Roggens wurde auch dadurch vermindert, dass im Zusammenhangmit der Infektion ein Beschädigen von Ähren und Halmen vor sich ging. Das Aufspriessen des Kornertrages des infizierten Roggens ist durch den Mutterkornpilz nicht deutlich beeinflusst worden (Tabellen 4 und 5). Bei dem üblichen Dreschen und Sortieren des Roggens konnten die Mutterkörner aus dem Getreide in dem Masse entfernt werden (0.00—0.11 % Mutterkörner), dass es der Verkäuflichkeitsforderung (0.25 %) entsprach. Demgegenüber kann aber selbst bei gründlichem Sortieren das Ausbreiten eines ausländischen, giftigen Mutterkornstammes von den Mutterkornkulturen in Roggenkulturen wohl nicht ganz vermieden werden, zum mindesten nicht in dem Falle, dass Mutterkornund Roggen-Wirtschaftskulturen nahe beieinander gelegen sind.",

    "abstract": "In carrying out a time study in the field of agricultural work it is very rarely that situations occur in which the outward conditions which affect the work could be regarded as completely invariable and in which the time spent on the work would be the only varying factor to be recorded. On the contrary, most often quite a number of different factors have an effect on the carrying out of the work, so many factors, indeed, that only the most important of them can be taken into account when carrying out time study. Almost without exception, therefore, a preliminary study must be made first, its aim being to clear up the most important of the factors affecting the work and to determine which of them should be taken into account in the final study. Furthermore, the preliminary study determins the measurement of the affecting factors either with objective measuring methods or by creating a classification, based on a subjective estimate made by a time study engineer, which can be considered sufficiently clear and practicable. In the study now in hand the thinning of sugar-beet with a shortshafted hoe, using the pull push method a preliminary study has been made of the work performed by several men on one day. On the basis of the preliminary study the following factors affecting the work were finally chosen to be included: the average length of the seedlings, the quality of the surface of the soil, abundance of weeds in the soil, and the number of the seedlings left at the thinning. As the unit used in the study the work done on 10 linear metres was chosen, and the determination of the different factors was correspondingly fixed. For the estimation of the abundance of weeds in the soil the following classification was made: I Class no weeds II » weeds in places III » some weeds IV » a moderate number of weeds V » weeds in abundance The quality of the surface of the soil was divided into three classes: I Class loose II » clods, somewhat encrusted III » clods, very encrusted, the soil hard. Furthermore, special instructions were given in regard to both of the aforementioned classifications, and their application was made uniform by the group training of the persons collecting the material. The length of the seedlings was measured by taking samples from three points on the unit under observation, and the mean average was computed. The number of the seedlings left at the thinning was taken from each research unit as the sum total. For the mathematical treatment of the material, the different factors were given symbols as follows: x1 = time spent on work/10 linear metres x2 = average length of seedlings/10 linear metres x3 = quality of surface of soil/10 linear metres x4 = abundance of weeds in soil/10 linear metres x5 = number of seedlings left at thinning/10 linear metres The statistically-mathematical treatment of the material is based on the hypothesis, reached on the basis of a preliminary study, that the time x1 is linearly dependent on the factors x2, x3, x4 and x5 which affect the work. The phenomenon may be described by a straight line the equation of which has the form: x1 = a + b * x2 + c * x3 + d * x4 + e * x5 and shows the simultaneous variation of the different arguments which affect the work. On the basis of the characteristics computed from the primary material the estimated final value of the aforementioned regression line of the work is: x1 = 0.15 + 0.05 * x2 + 0.40 * x3 + 0.47 * x4 + 0.05 * x5. To allow comparison the mathematical treatment was carried out, also by using a partial correlation computation. The coefficients of the correlation series are shown on page 224. In the series of the final coefficients of correlation r12x345 = 0.10 r13x245 = 0.33 r14x235 = 0.63 r15x234 = 0.35 the significance of the value r12x315 = 0.10 is so small that it cannot be regarded as probable. The other values, on the other hand, describe the phenomenon with an accuracy probability of 95%. To check the mathematical treatment on the basis of the aforementioned coefficients of correlation, the values of the coefficients a, b, c, d and e in the equation x1 = a + bx2 + cx3 + dx4 + ex5 have been computed and a result has been arrived at which is completely consistent with the result reached by the computation of the regression line. For practical application, working time values/10 linear metres, which are in accordance with the straight line obtained, have been computed on to Table No. 1, page 225. Also the additional 7.5 % have been taken into consideration in the calculations as corresponding to accepted interruptions, in accordance with the preliminary study. Since the importance of the lenght of the seedlings is of very little significance and not even probable, it has not been taken into consideration. The computations have been made as corresponding to a length of 5 cm. of the seedlings. Table No. 1 shows the money values which are in accordance with the time values on Table No. 1 and which keep to the basis agreed upon at the negotiations between the organizations on the labour-market. As the work in question has been work on a contract a 30 % increase for the contract has been agreed upon to be observed. Table No. 2 has been computed according to wages of 80 mks. per hour and the prices have been stated in pennies as the price paid for work per metre. The increase corresponding to the contract has been allowed in the figures.",

    "abstract": "Tutkituista kasvualustoista soveltui Claviceps purpurea (Fr.) Tul.:n kuromien kasvattamiseen Kirchhhoffin (12) suosittelema ravintoagari kaikkein parhaiten. Myös erilaiset viljanjyväalustat olivat käyttökelpoisia. Saastutusaikakokeen tulokset osoittivat, että sopivin saastutusaika on silloin kun 35—85 % rukiin tähkistä on vapautunut lehtitupesta; eräässä koesarjassa saatiin runsas torajyväsato, kun 10—85 % tähkistä oli näkyvissä. Torajyväsienen kehityksen kulkuun, sen Sphacelia-asteen ja sklerootioiden muodostumisen alkamiseen, ei saastutuksen ajankohdalla näyttänyt olleen vaikutusta, edellytettynä, että saastutus tapahtui ajalla 9. 6.—2. 8. Viikin koetilan kokeissa vuosina 1952—1955 saadut rukiin torajyväsadot (tähkistä poimitut) olivat 83—258 kg/ha; v. 1952, jolloin saastutusajan sää oli kostea, sadon määrä muodostui suurimmaksi. Torajyvän maahan varisemista tapahtui huomattavassa määrin vaikka, suurin osa sklerootioista korjattiin n. viikkoa ennen rukiin tuleentumista. Keskimääräinen varisemistappio oli vuosina 1952—1955 41.4 %, äärimmäistapauksessa lähes 80 %. Pohjois-Savon, Pohjois-Pohjanmaan ja Perä-Pohjolan kasvinviljelyskoeasemilla jäivät torajyväsadot Viikin koetilan vastaavia satoja keskimäärin vähän alhaisemmiksi, kuitenkin myös lähellä napapiiriä, Apukan koeasemalla, saatiin torajyvästä tuleentunut sato. Ulkomaisista torajyväkannoista osoittautuivat saksalainen D1 ja portugalilainen P2 satoisammiksi ja viljelyvarmemmiksi kuin D1:stä polveutuva D2 portugalilainen P3. Pekkarukiissa viljellyn D1 -torajyväkannan sklerootiosato muodostui Oivarukiin vastaavaa satoa suuremmaksi. Tämä johtui ratkaisevasti siitä, että sklerootiot kehittyivät suuremmiksi Pekka- kuin Oivarukiin tähkissä. Petkus-kevätrukiissa torajyväsato oli varsin suuri, joten näyttää aiheelliselta tutkia erityisesti kevätrukiin soveltuvuutta torajyväsienisaastutuksiin Suomen olosuhteissa. Saksalaisten D1- (D3-) ja D4- sekä kaikkien tutkittujen portugalialisten tora-jyväkantojen kokonaisalkaloidipitoisuus muodostui Suomessa yhtä suureksi kuin Saksassa. Vain vesiliukoisten alkaloidien määrä näytti Suomessa jääneen suhteellisen pieneksi.",

    "abstract": "Sokerijuurikkaan juuren ja naatin kasvua sekä sokeripitoisuuden kehittymistä kasvukausien 1950—1954 aikana on seurattu juurikasmailta viikoittain otettujen näytteiden perusteella. Näytetiloja on valittu yhtä paljon kustakin Turengin Sokeritehtaan viljelyalueen neuvontapiiristä. Kolmena viimeksi kuluneena vuonna on näitä tiloja ollut vuosittain yhteensä 90 tai enemmän. Näytteiden ottaminen tietyn järjestelmän mukaisesti, jolloin subjektiivinen valinnan mahdollisuus jää pois, antaa parhaan tuloksen. 20 juurikasta kussakin näytteessä on todennäköisesti riittävä silloin, kun näytteitä otetaan yhteensä useita kymmeniä. Sokerijuurikkaan naatti kehittyy harvennuksen jälkeen hyvin nopeasti. Korkeimmillaan on naatin paino keskimäärin syyskuun lopussa. Sääsuhteet ja myös kylvöaika vaikuttavat naatin samoin kuin juurenkin kasvuun suuresti. Aikaisena vuonna 1953 on naatin paino ollut suurin jo syyskuun alussa. Juuren kasvu alkaa vasta heinäkuun alussa ja on nopeimmillaan elokuussa. Elokuun kasvu on keskimäärin 40 % juurikkaan lopullisesta painosta. Yleensä juuren paino lisääntyy jonkinverran vielä lokakuun aikanakin. Eri vuosina kasvu on erilaista, nimenomaan kasvukauden alkupuoliskolla. Jo tällöin tulee varsinaisesti ratkaistuksi, millaiseksi juurikkaan keskipaino muodostuu. Juuren lisäkasvu syyskuun alusta nostoaikaan mennessä on ollut keskimäärin noin 100 grammaa. Nostoajan keskiarvopaino on laskettu syyskuun lopussa ja lokakuun kahden ensimmäisen viikon aikana otettujen viikkonäytteitten mukaan. Sokeripitoisuuden kehittymiseen vaikuttavat sääolosuhteet ratkaisevasti. Keskimäärin eri vuosina lisääntyy juurikkaan sokeripitoisuus vähitellen hidastuen koko kasvukauden ajan. Vilkkaimmillaan on sokerin varastoituminen juureen elokuun lopulla ja syyskuun alkuviikkojen aikana. Juurikkaan kykyä tuottaa sokeria ei ilmastossamme voida täydellisesti käyttää hyväksi, koska nosto on yleensä saatava suoritetuksi loppuun jonkinverran ennenaikaisesti. Kun suurimmat eroavaisuudet juurikkaan kasvussa ilmenevät jo kasvukauden alkupuoliskolla, on mahdollista laskelmoida elokuun lopussa saatujen viikottaisten punnitustulosten ja keskimääräisen lisäkasvun perusteella, millainen juurikkaan keskipaino tulee nostoaikana olemaan. Tämän keskipainon suuruudesta riippuu saatavan juurikassadon suuruus. Tutkimustulosten mukaisesti on päädytty kaavaan, jota käyttäen odotettavissa oleva hehtaarikeskisato voidaan laskea näyte juurikkaiden keskipainon perusteella.",

    "abstract": "In this study the aim has been to survey the return and costs of horticulture on a given farm, in this case the Malmi Estate, the Instructional and Experimental Farm of Helsinki University. The three points on which especial attention has been focussed in the research are as follows: 1) the structure and amount of the return and costs of different branches of production and of crop groups, 2) the use of the means of production measured as physical quantities, 3) the division of the return and cost items between various crop groups and branches of production. The study includes the financial years 1950/ 1951 and 1951/1952 from April 1st, 1950, to March 31st, 1952. The garden concerned can be described as a commercial garden and in this respect it can be compared with other commercial gardens of diversified production. The only essential difference from private horticultural undertakings is that the Malmi Estate, as a state-owned farm, is exempt from taxes. The amount and structure of the return is given in table 1. The figures show that in some cases there are considerable changes in the returns of the various crop groups in different years. This fact is especially valid as regards the intercrops, which represent typical mixed crops. The receipts make the overwhelmingly biggest part of the return in all crop groups. The »interior transfers» (the materials furnished by one branch of production to another) have been of some importance and even of paramount importance in the growing of ornamental plants and of vegetables in hotbeds. The indirect return has been practically of no consequence. Tables 2, 3 and 4 and figures I—7 show the results concerning the amount and structure of the costs. It is striking how closely the return level is followed by the cost level in the various crop groups. The costs are overwhelmingly highest in the production of ornamental plants. This proves true in growing crops both outdoors and under glass. The figures show' very clearly how different the various crop groups are as regards the use of labour and capital. Vegetables and ornamental plants in hotbeds, small fruits and outdoor vegetables are typically the heaviest labour-consuming plants. The glasshouses involve high capital investment, as is demonstrated by the amount of the capital costs and the cost of material. Tables 2 and 3, and the summary in table 5 indicate the importance of the direct and indirect costs in the various crop groups. The direct costs represent a relatively small part of the total costs in growing crops in hotbeds; this fact denotes that this branch of production is connected with the whole horticultural enterprise rather closely. The direct costs are relatively highest when crops are grown outdoors. Table 6 shows that the direct costs are less than two thirds of the cost of material; they constitute a still greater proportion of the capital and labour costs, but only a fourth of the tractor and horse work costs. The payments for water, electricity, telephone and cables, and postage (service) and the management costs of the enterprise, belong entirely to the direct costs. Broadly speaking 60 per cent of the total costs of the Malmi Estate Garden have been direct costs and 40 per cent indirect costs. As regards the various crop groups, it has been possible to work out with some certainty only the labour (time) requirement and the application of the plant nutrients in commercial fertilizers. In table 7 information on the direct labour (time) requirement and in table 8 on the indirect labour (time) requirement of various jobs are given. In order to get a more illustrative general picture, the various jobs have been grouped as follows 1) spring farming operations, 2) management of crops, 3) harvesting and 4) other work.1 The average apple yield has been 32.5 kg per are, the yield in this case consisting only of marketable fruit. Thus the labour (time) requirement has been 33.8 hours per 100 kg. The average yield of small fruits has been 44.1 kg per are and the labour (time) requirement 70.5 hours per 100 kg. The small fruits have consisted almost entirely of currants and gooseberries. As table 10 shows, the application of commercial fertilizers has been heaviest in glasshouses and for the vegetables in hotbeds.",

Kun tulvaniitty voi joinakin vuosina jäädä melkein kokonaan veden alle, tuntuu lannoituksen taloudellinen kannattavaisuus kuitenkin epävarmalta. 4. Lannoitus lisäsi erityisesti tulvanarkojen kasvilajien (heinäkasvit ym.) osuutta kasvustoissa. Siten se heikensi kasvustojen tulvankestävyyttä. Kun sitä paitsi lannoituksen vaikutus osoittautui hitaaksi, kohdannee tulvaniityn tarkoituksenmukainen lannoittaminen suuria vaikeuksia. 5. Kalkituksella, varsinkin lannoituksen ohella, oli pikemminkin haitallinen kuin satoa lisäävä vaikutus. 6. Tulvaniitylle kylvetyt 15 nurmikasvilajia eivät ilman lannoitusta antaneet satoa. Lannoitetulla tulvaniityllä niistä menestyivät parhaiten timotei- ja nurmipuntarpää, mutta runsaan sadon ne antoivat vain heinäkasvi-maasaravyöhykkeellä. Silloinkin kun tulvaveden liiallinen korkeus ei ollut ehdottomana esteenä, varsinainen sato saatiin vain 1—2 vuotena. 7. Kylvetyt heinälajit antoivat eräissä kokeissa satoa lannoitetun luonnonheinän sekaan kylvettyinä. Yleensä ne kuitenkin saivat jalansijaa vain muokatussa maassa, jossa niiden sato poikkeuksetta oh runsain (huippusato n. 4000 kg/ha). - Tulvaveden vaihtelujen ja työn vaivalloisuuden vuoksi ei Kaamasenjoen tulvaniittyjen yleistä muokkausta voitane ennen huomattavia vedenpinnan laskemistoimenpiteitä toteuttaa. 8. Lannoitetun maan nopea sammaloituminen ilmeisesti vaikeutti heinälajien menestymistä tulvaniityllä. 9. Karhunsammal (Polytrichum swartzii) ja timotei (Phleum pratense) sietivät jokseenkin yhtä ankaran tulvavesi vaikutuksen.",

    "abstract": "Syksyllä 1954 tuli ensimmäisen perunasyöpätapauksen toteamisesta maassamme kuluneeksi 30 vuotta. Tänä aikana ovat kasvinsuojeluviranomaiset todenneet tautia kaikkiaan 59 nyky-Suomen kunnassa 582 perunamaassa, joiden yhteenlaskettu pinta-ala on 47.61 ha. Kuten kartasta s. 201 näkyy, on levinneisyys rajoittunut pääasiassa maan lounais-, etelä- ja itäosiin. Lukumääräisesti on perunasyöpäesiintymistä ollut 62.3 % asutuskeskuksissa, joilla tässä tarkoitetaan kaupunkeja ja kauppaloita. Niissä ovat saastuneet viljelykset kooltaan keskimäärin 38.7 % pienempiä kuin maaseudulla ja enimmäkseen vain muutaman aarin suuruisia puutarha- ja palstaviljelyksiä. Varmaa on, että vuonna 1925 säädettyyn kasvinsuojelulakiin perustuvalla perunasyövän torjuntatoimenpiteillä on ollut ratkaisevasti taudin leviämistä hidastava ja rajoittava vaikutus. Maatalousministeriön antamalla päätöksellä on nykyisin 6 kaupunkia, 6 kauppalaa, 2 maalaiskuntaa ja 10 muuta kuntaa julistettu perunasyövän saastuttamiksi, mikä merkitsee, että niiden alueella on syövänarkojen perunalajikkeiden viljely ja kauppaaminen kielletty. Syövänkestävien perunalajikkeiden valikoima on nykyisin jo varsin runsas ja monipuolinen. Kuitenkaan ei niitä, vuonna 1950 saatujen tietojen mukaan, viljellä kuin vajaalla kolmanneksella (31.6 %) koko peruna-alaamme. Perunasyövän kauimmin ja pahimmin vaivaamilla seuduilla lounais-, etelä- ja itä-Suomessa se on kuitenkin selvästi yleisempää kuin muualla johtuen ilmeisesti nimenomaan näillä seuduilla harjoitetusta valistus- ja neuvontatoiminnasta. Maatalouden koetoiminnan taholla vuonna 1954 tehdyllä päätöksellä syövänarkojen perunalajikkeiden hylkäämisestä kokeista muualla paitsi Oulun, Lapin ja Vaasan lääneissä tulee varmasti olemaan kauaskantoinen merkitys syövänkestävien perunalajikkeiden yleistymisessä. Vasta täydellinen siirtyminen syövänkestävien perunalajikkeiden viljelyyn poistaisi sen perunanviljelyä uhkaavan vaaran, mikä liittyy uusien, nykyisiä syövänkestäviäkin perunalajikkeita saastuttavien perunasyövänaiheuttajan rotujen syntymiseen.",

Näyteaineisto osoittautui lajiksi Typhula betae Rostr. Sen rihmastopahkat ovat täysin kehittyneinä tummanruskeita tai lähes mustia, pyöreähköjä, kuivina kooltaan 0.8 —1.8 mm ja ydinosaltaan vaaleita. Itiöemä (10- 20 mm) on pysty ja haaraton. Sen varsiosa on kalju tai heikosti villakarvainen sekä nuijaosaa tummempi. Väritön tai valkoinen nuijaosa on sukkulamainen, 0.8—4.3 mm:n pituinen ja 0.5 mm:n paksuinen.

Esitetyt tiedot sekä kasvitautiosaston taholta suoritetut, syysrypsin talvehtimisvaurioiden syitä selvittelevät havainnot osoittavat, että Suomessa esiintyy syysrypsissä yleisenä Typhula-sieniä., ja että tähänastisten tietojen perusteella talvehtimisvaurioiden aiheuttajana on laji Typhula betae Rostr.",

    "abstract": "Georg von Wendt wurde am 21.3.1876 in Helsinki geboren. Sein Vater war Oberst Fredrik Willehad v. Wendt und seine Mutter Freiherrin Fanny Elisabeth von Born. Im Jahre 1904 schloss er die Ehe mit Lilli Gummerus, Tochter des Hofgerichtsrats Gregorius Gummerus. Georg v. Wendt bestand 1893 die Reifeprüfung, wurde 1903 Lizentiat der Medizin, 1905 Doktor der Medizin und Chirurgie sowie 1908 Doktor der Philosophie (in Leipzig). Er wurde 1910 als Professor der Haustierlehre an die Universität Helsinki berufen. Im Jahre 1943 trat er in den Ruhestand. Die medizinische Dissertation v. Wendts hiess »Untersuchungen über den Eiweiss- und Salzstoffwechsel beim Menschen» und die Dissertation für den Titel eines Doktors der Philosophie »Zur Variabilität der Milch». Von den übrigen Veröffentlichungen sind die bedeutendsten »Theoretische Grundlagen der Stoffwechsellehre » und »Mineralstoffwechsel», Arbeiten, die beide in das von Oppenheimer herausgegebene »Handbuch des Menschen und der Tiere» aufgenommen worden sind. Auf dem Gebiet der Ernährung der Haustiere veröffentlichte v. Wendt viele wertvolle wissenschaftliche Aufsätze und für die Praxis vorgesehene Broschüren. Unter letzteren ist »Die höchste Eierleistung» eine der bekanntesten. Gemeinverständliche Studien v. Wendts über die Ernährung des Menschen sind in fast alle Kultursprachen übersetzt worden. Als Vortragender war v. Wendt in Finnland wie auch im Ausland sehr beliebt. In den Jahren 1904—-1906 war v. Wendt Vertreter seines Geschlechts auf dem Reichstage, und 1919—1922 war er Mitglied in der einkammerigen Volksvertretung. 1906 war er an dem Entwurf des Vorschlages für das neue Wahlgesetz beteiligt. Die grosse und vielseitige Begabung v. Wendts führte dazu, dass er sich für alles Neue, was Kunst, Wissenschaft und Technik hervorbrachten, begeisterte und er selbst bei all diesem aktiv mit dabei zu sein suchte, indem er seinen schöpferischen Beitrag zum Spiele lieferte. Dieser Charakterzug hinderte ihn, in der Wissenschaft in die Reihe der Marschälle aufzusteigen, wohin ihn seine Begabung und schöpferische Intuition hätten erheben können. Aber diejenigen, die Gelegenheit gehabt haben, Georg von Wendt kennenzulernen, werden sich seiner als ideenreichen Anregers, unvergleichlichen Lehrers und guten Menschen erinnern.",

The role of AMF in arid, saline or heavy metal contaminated sites was discussed in several papers. Also the impact of temperature on AM function and possibilites of utilizing AMF in low- and high-input agricultural systems were discussed. Papers on the role of AMF in controlling biotic stress, i.e. plant diseases, of crops were also presented.

    "abstract": "Tutkimus perustuu maatalouskoelaitoksen kotieläinjalostusosastolla tarkkailuvuodesta 1949/50 lähtien Hollerith-järjestelmällä suoritettuihin sonnien jälkeläisarvosteluihin, jotka toistaiseksi tapahtuvat tytärten keskiarvoja käyttäen. Tutkimuksessa on vuorosuhdekertoimia laskien verrattu eri maanviljelysseura-alueilla saatuja saman sonnin tytärten keskiarvoja toisiinsa. Ayrshireaineisto käsittää 203 ja suomenkarjan aineisto 60 sonnia. Vertailujen tuloksena voitiin todeta, että sonnien perinnöllisen maidontuotantotaipumuksen arvostelussa suhteellinen arvostelutapa, käytettiinpä arvostelun perustana prosentteina ilmaistuja suhteellisia tuotoksia sellaisenaan tai näiden poikkeamia samanikäisten jälkeläisryhmien keskiarvosta, johtaa yleensä varmemmin onnistuvaan jalostustyön edistymiseen kuin kilomääräisiin tuotoksiin perustuva valinta. Tämän osoittaa myös vertailu, jossa toisen arvostelutuloksen kilomääräistä maitotuotosta verrattiin toisen suhteelliseen maitotuotokseen, jolloin saatiin useimmissa tapauksissa pienemmät vuorosuhteet kuin suhteellisista tuotoksista. Maidontuotantotaipumuksen arvostelu varmistuu, kun suhteelliset tuotokset täydennetään karjojen todennäköisillä laadullisilla poikkeamilla rodun keskiarvosta. Tämä tapahtuu painottamalla yksilön suhteellista maitotuotosta ja karjan poikkeamaa rodun keskiarvosta (karjan suhteellista arvoa) tietyssä suhteessa. Ayrshirerodulla prosenttisia arvoja käytettäessä yksi suhteellisen arvon prosenttiyksikkö vastaa 240 kg:n keskituotoseroa, ja jos suhteelliset arvot on ilmaistu kilomääräisinä erotuksina, on suhteellisten tuotosten ja keskituotoserojen painojen suhde 6: 1. Suomenkarjan aineiston pienuuden vuoksi ei vastaavia laskelmia siitä suoritettu. Kokeilemalla eri painotuksia saatiin suurimmat korrelaatiot ayrshirerodulla, jonka karjat ovat suurempia, silloin kun painotussuhde oli 5: 1 yksilön suhteellisten tuotosten hyväksi, ja pienikarjaisella suomenkarjalla, kun painotus tapahtui suhteessa 9: 1. Viimeksi mainittuun tulokseen on kuitenkin keskituotosten melkoinen vuorosuhde luultavasti vaikuttanut. Säännöllisyysprosentti, joka ilmaisee säännöllisten lehmien osuuden kaikista sonnin jälkeläisistä, on ilmeisesti sangen epävarma hedelmällisyystaipumuksen ja tautien vastustuskyvyn mitta, koska siitä on saatu varsin epävarmat vuorosuhteet. Myös lypsykäyrän muodon arvosteleminen viiden kuukauden prosentilla osoittautuu melko epävarmaksi. Suomenkarjan aineiston yleensä heikommat vuorosuhteet johtunevat ilmeisesti pääasiassa tämän rodun sonnien pienemmästä jälkeläisten luvusta, joka nyt käsitellyssä aineistossa oli keskimäärin 17 vastaavan luvun avrshirerodulla ollessa 27.",

    "abstract": "Tutkimus suoritettiin sektorilla (30—180°), jonka maa poistettiin kerroksittain (5, 10 ja 20 cm) ja vyöhykkeittäin (30 tai 50 cm). Tästä maasta erotettiin juuret, jotka punnittiin kahtena eränä (paksut &gt; 2 mm ja hienot &lt; 2 mm). Muita tutkimuksia varten otettiin myös vastaavat maanäytteet, joista tehtyihin tutkimuksiin ei tässä yhteydessä kajota. Yhteenvetona tutkituista tapauksista voidaan tehdä seuraavia päätelmiä. Juuristo leviää nuorilla puilla suhteellisesti nopeammin kuin latvus ja saattaa ulottua 1—1.5 metriä latvuksen kehän ulkopuolelle. Omenapuun juuristo muodostuu yleensä tasapaksuun kerrokseen, joka nuorilla puilla on 40—50 cm paksu ja syvenee iän mukana. Parhaissa maissa (HHt) se ulottuu vanhemmissa puissa (n:ot 6 ja 7) metrin syvyyteen. Tiiviisiin maihin juuristo ei mene niin syvälle (esim. AS n:o 9). Hiekassa juuristo keskittyy multakerroksen alaosaan ja välttää selvästi auhtoa pohjamaan hiekkaa (n:ot 4 ja 5). Mulloksella pidetyssä maassa juuristo karttaa muokattavaa kerrosta, joka eri olosuhteissa on 5—20 cm paksu (esim. n:ot 6 ja 7). Nurmi ja kate maan pinnalla näyttävät olevan juurille erittäin edullisia koska juuristo niiden alla nousee aivan maan pintaan saakka. Pääasiallinen juuristokerros omenapuilla alkaa noin 10 cm:n syvyydestä ja ulottuu noin 50 cm:iin. Tässä kerroksessa yleensä on suurin juuritiheys. Useimmissa tapauksissa juuritiheys on melko tasainen (0—50 cm:n kerroksessa) aivan rungon lähiympyrää (0—90 cm) lukuunottamatta. Juuriston levinneisyyttä selvittelevä tutkimus on osa laajemmasta hedelmätarhojen maaprofiilia koskevasta tutkimuksesta, jonka tarkoituksena on hedelmätarhan viljavuuskysymysten käsittely. Tässä työssä muodostaa puiden juuriston selvittely hyvin oleellisen osan. Omenapuun osalta voidaan tutkimuksen tuloksia jo käyttää hyväksi esim. viljelyteknillisiä ratkaisuja suunniteltaessa. Erityisesti maan pinnan hoito ja hedelmätarhan lannoitus ovat kysymyksiä, joissa nimenomaan juuristo on tärkeimpiä tekijöitä. Myös tarhan sijoittamisessa, jolloin maalaji on otettava huomioon, on tämän tutkimuksen tuloksilla merkityksensä.",

    "abstract": "Meijerien Keskusosuusliike Valion Ylitornion meijerin sikalassa suoritetuissa toisen vuoden ruokintakokeissa, joissa oli verrattavana a) perusrehu ynnä tuore hera, b) perusrehu + kaurankuorijauholisä ynnä tuore hera sekä c) perusrehu ynnä kuivattu hera, saatiin seuraavat tulokset. Kun kuivarehuseoksen raakakuitupitoisuus nostettiin 6.9 %:sta 9.2 %:iin lisäämällä 40 kilon elopainorajasta alkaen perusrehuun 10 % kaurankuorijauhoja, tämä toimenpide ei pienentänyt kuivarehun eikä lisännyt heran kulutusta. Seurauksena oli jonkinverran pienempi lisäkasvu ja suurempi suhteellinen rehunkulutus kuin vertailuryhmällä. Osittain tämä tulos voi johtua siitä, että heran kulutus jäi tässä kokeessa odotettua pienemmäksi eli vain noin 1200 kiloon eläintä kohden. Kun tuoreen heran sijasta käytettiin kuivattua heraa 50 % kuivarehuseoksessa, niin kokeen alkuvaiheessa 45 kg:n elopainorajaan saakka kuivatulla heralla näytti olevan kasvunopeuteen ja rehun hyväksikäyttöön edullisia vaikutuksia tuoreeseen heraan verrattuna. Suuremmille sioille syötettynä kuivattu hera taas osoittautui eläinten kasvunopeuden nojalla arvostellen vähemmän edulliseksi, mutta tällöinkin kuivatulla heralla saavutettiin kuitenkin käytettyä ry:ä kohden keskimäärin suhteellisesti parempi tuotantovaikutus kuin tuoreella heralla.",

    "abstract": "Traktorin kunnossapitokustannuksen laskemisessa on turvauduttava huomattavassa määrin arviointeihin. Perustuen asiantuntijalautakuntien suorittamiin arvioihin eri traktorinosien kestosta on laskettu korjauskustannus maatilakäytössä olevalle traktorille, jota käytetään keskim. 500 tuntia vuodessa 12 vuoden ajan. Korjauskustannusten huippu sattuu 7—B käyttövuosien vaiheille, jolloin ne muodostavat n. 2/3 traktorin käyttöikäisistä korjauskustannuksista. Käytännöstä saadut kirjanpitotulokset tukivat em. arviota. Myös traktoreita myyvien liikkeiden antamasta, varaosien myyntiä eri myyntipiireissä koskevasta aineistosta saadut tiedot kävivät yhteen arvion kanssa. Liikkeiden aineiston ja maataloushallituksen kirjanpitotiloilta saatujen tietojen perusteella voidaan todeta traktorien käytön olevan runsaampaa ja ankarampaa sisä-, itä- ja pohjois-Suomessa kuin varsinaisilla maanviljelysseuduilla. Kun korjauskustannukseen lisätään tilan omin voimin suoritettu kunnossapitotyö, joka nousee lähes kymmeneen prosenttiin kunnossapitokustannuksesta, saadaan eri kokoisille kaasutin- ja dieseltraktoreille seuraavat keskimääräistä käyttöä vastaavat kunnossapitokustannukset: pieni (10—20 hv) kaasutintraktori 45: —/käyttötunti keskikokoinen (20—30 hv) kaasutintraktori 50: —/käyttötunti keskikokoinen (20—30 hv) dieseltraktori 55: —/käyttötunti suuri (yli 30 hv) dieseltraktori 65: —/käyttötunti Dieseltraktorin kunnossapitokustannus nousee n. 13 % vastaavankokoisen kaasutintraktorin kunnossapitokustannusta korkeammaksi. Traktorin käyttöikäinen kunnossapitokustannus nousee n. 90 prosenttiin traktorin ostohinnasta. Kun yli puolet siitä voi langeta yhden tai parin käyttövuoden osalle, saattaa käytetyn traktorin ostaja joutua maksamaan täyskorjauksesta puolet uuden traktorin hinnasta.",

    "abstract": "Tutkimus on jatkoa aikaisemmin julkaistuille kokeille (3). Lehmillä suoritettiin kaksi koetta, 30 päivän (koe I) ja 40 päivän (koe II) pituiset. Kokeessa I saivat lehmät syödä vapaasti laitumella erikseen ruokintakalkkia, rehufosfaattia (dikalsiumfosfaattia), mononatriumfosfaattia, dinatriumfosfaattia ja ruokasuolaa. Ruokintakalkkia (5 g/p eläintä kohti) ja rehufosfaattia (7 g/p) ne söivät hyvin vähän. Sensijaan dinatriumfosfaattia (28 g/p) ja erityisesti mononatriumfosfaattia (63 g/p) ne söivät halukkaasti. Ruokasuolaa kului kokeessa verrattain vähän (11 g/p), koska ne saivat runsaasti natriumia Na-fosfaateissa, Edellä mainituissa kivennäisrehuissa lehmät saivat eläintä kohti seuraavat määrät; Ca 3.6 g/p, P 16.2 g/p, Na 17.4 g/p ja Na-määrä laskettuna NaCl:ksi 44 g/p. Kokeessa II saivat lehmät syödä vapaasti laitumella rehusuolaseoksia I (53 % dikalsiumfosfaattia + 42 % ruokintakalkkia), II (55 % dikalsiumfosfaattia + 10 % dinatriumfosfaattia + 25 % ruokasuolaa), III (94 % mononatriumfosfaattia), rehuluujauhoja ja ruokasuolaa (ks. s. 150). Rehusuolaseosta I (4 g/p eläintä kohti) ja II (5 g/p) ne söivät hyvin vähän. Luujauhoja (31 g/p) ja erityisesti seosta III (61 g/p) ne söivät halukkaasti. Ruokasuolaa ei kulunut kovin runsaasti (28 g/p), koska ne saivat natriumia seoksien sisältämissä Na-fosfaateissa. Edellä mainituissa kivennäisrehuissa lehmät saivat eläintä kohti seuraavat määrät: Ca 10.8 g/p, P 16.5 g/p, Na 20.5 g/p ja Na-määrä laskettuna NaCl:ksi 52 g/p. Kokeissa olivat parhaiten syötyjä kivennäisrehuja mononatriumfosfaatti, rehuluujauhot ja dinatriumfosfaatti. Ruokasuolan syönti on riippuvainen siitä, miten paljon ne saavat natriumia muissa kivennäisrehuissa. Jos lehmille on tarjolla Na-fosfaatteja, ilman että luujauhoja on saatavissa (vaikkakin ruokintakalkkia+rehufosfaattia on saatavissa), muodostuuvat lehmien syömät ainemäärät huomattavan fosforivoittoisiksi. Jos on luujauhoja + Na-fosfaatteja, ovat P-määrät runsaat ja Ca-määrät keskinkertaiset. Ruokintakalkkia ja rehufosfaattia (dikalsiumfosfaattia) lehmät syövät vähän, varsinkin jos on Na-fosfaatteja saatavissa. V. 1957 kokeessa II, jossa oli luujauhoja ruokintakalkkia ja dikalsiumfosfaattia pääasiassa sisältävien seoksien ohella, oli eläinten syömä Ca-määrä runsas ja P-määrä keskinkertainen. Ruokintakalkkia (CaCO3) ja rehufosfaattia (CaHPO4) yksinomaan saadessaan ovat lehmien syömät Ca- ja erityisesti P-määrät verrattain pienet. Hiehoilla suoritettiin kaksi koetta, 30 päivän (koe I) ja 50 päivän (koe II) pituiset. Kokeessa I saivat hiehot syödä vapaasti laitumella erikseen ruokintakalkkia, rehufosfaattia (dikalsiumfosfaattia), mononatriumfosfaattia ja ruokasuolaa. Ruokintakalkkia (35 g/p eläintä kohti) ja rehufosfaattia (24 g/p) ne söivät kohtalaisesti. Mononatriumfosfaattia (117 g/p) ne söivät hyvin halukkaasti. Ruokasuolan kulutus (5 g/p) oli vähäistä, mikä johtui mononatriumfosfaatin runsaasta syönnistä. Edellä mainituissa kivennäisrehuissa hiehot saivat eläintä kohti seuraavat määrät: Ca 18.8 g/p, P 27.3 g/p, Na 18.9 g/p ja Na-määrä laskettuna NaCl:ksi 48 g/p. Kokeessa II saivat hiehot syödä vapaasti rehusuolaseoksia II (55 % dikalsiumfosfaattia, 10 % dinatriumfosfaattia, 25 % ruokasuolaa), III (94 % mononatriumfosfaattia), rehuluujauhoja ja ruokasuolaa. Rehusuolaseosta II (4 g/p eläintä kohti) ne söivät hyvin vähän. Seosta III (109 g/p) ne söivät runsaasti, johtuen sensisältämästä mononatriumfosfaatista. Luujauhoja (33 g/p) ne söivät kohtalaisesti ja ruokasuolaa (11 g/p) vähän. Edellä mainituissa kivennäisrehuissa hiehot saivat eläintä kohti seuraavat määrät: Ca 10.4 g/p, P 25.4 g/p, Na 20.5 g/p ja Na-määrä laskettuna NaCl:ksi 52 g/p. Molemmissa kokeissa hiehot söivät runsaasti mononatriumfosfaattia. Sen ohella ne söivät kohtalaisen runsaasti luujauhoja (koe II). Kun luujauhoja ei ollut saatavissa kokeessa I, ne söivät kohtalaisen runsaasti ruokintakalkkia ja dikalsiumfosfaattia, joita eivät lehmät olleet halunneet vastaavassa kokeessa syödä paljoakaan. Hiehot haluavat syödä runsaammin Ca-pitoisia kivennäisrehuja kuin lehmät. Myös P-määrät olivat suurempia kuin lehmien syömät. Suurempi kivennäisrehujen tarve hiehoilla johtuu ilmeisesti siitä, että hiehojen syömät laidunrehumäärät ovat pienemmät kuin lehmien, ja toisaalta kasvavan hiehon kivennäisaineitten tarve on suuri. Jos hiehoilla on saatavissa mononatriumfosfaattia, ovat syödyt P-määrät runsaat, jos sen ohella on myös luujauhoja tai kalkkikiveä + dikalsiumfosfaattia ovat syödyt Ca-määrät kohtalaisen suuret. Luujauhoja hiehot syövät halukkaammin kuin pääasiassa kalkkikiveä + dikalsiumfosfaattia sisältävää seosta (koe I 1957) samoinkuin dikalsiumfosfaattia sisältävää (koe II 1958). Jos luujauhoja ei ole saatavissa, syövät ne halukkaammin kalkkikiveä ja dikalsiumfosfaattia (koe I 1958). Vaikka v. 1958 kokeissa olleiden hiehojen keski-ikä (lähes 1 v. nuorempia) ja -elopaino (lähes 100 kg kevyempiä) olivat pienemmät, eivätkä useimmat olleet astutettuja (kokeessa v. 1957 olivat tiineyden loppupuolella), on kivennäisrehujen syönti ollut vähintäin samaa tasoa kuin v. 1957 kokeessa. Tämä johtuu ilmeisesti siitä, että mononatriumfosfaattia ne söivät halukkaasti. Myös pienemmät hiehot voivat syödä mahojensa vähäisemmän koon vuoksi ja pienemmän ravinnontarpeensa vuoksi vähemmän laidunruohoa, jolloin ne saavat siinä vähemmän kivennäisaineita. Toisaalta kuitenkin kasvavan hiehon kivennäisaineitten tarve on suuri. Sekä lehmillä että hiehoilla v. 1957—58 suoritetuissa kokeissa on todettavissa, että ruokasuolan (tai natriumin) kulutus on hieman suurempi keskikesällä kuin alkukesällä.",

The guarantee, however, covers only germination and purity, but it is commonly issued, particularly with all cereals, to cover also genuinneness of variety, though it is compulsory only with regard to the two top quality seed classes and does not concern ordinary seed on sale. The State Seed Testing Station must therefore possess a thorough knowledge of the varieties and their differentiation. Characteristics of the varieties are subject to constant study with new varieties appearing on sale. The above table of investigation on spring wheat varieties is a result of these studies and contains all the varieties that have been on sale at least for some time during the past 20 years, and of which a sample has been sent to the State Seed Testing Station in accordance with the seed law. Altogether 25 varieties of spring wheat are presented here. The newest, as well as some of the oldest varieties, have been studied only some 2—3 years, most varieties, however, for 10—20 years. Characteristics of the varieties have been investigated both in the laboratory and in the field. The above table of investigation provides a supplement to the table published earlier in this journal (Journal of the Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland, Vol. 13, 1941 (145—164)). In each the spring wheat varieties are classified approximately according to the same characteristics.",

The experimental animal, a fistulated cow, received a daily dose of 5 kg timothy hay, 1.3 kg protein concentrates, mineral salt mixture and 18 kg silage. The silage had been prepared: (1) with ammonium bisulphate (A.I.V. preservative salt), (2) with A.I.V. acid, (3) with Calcifor salt, and (4) without the addition of preservative. The mean ammonia concentrations of the rumen contents during the 12-hour period between feedings were, in the above-mentioned order, 0.903, 0.726, 0.683 and 0.705 mmol per 100 ml, respectively. When the three last-mentioned figures are employed as a basis of reference for the first, the ammonium nitrogen from the ammonium bisulphate retained in the fodder is found to have increased the ammonia concentration of the rumen contents by 0.177—0.220 mmol per 100 ml, equivalent to an increase by 24—32 % in the particular conditions of the experiment. The conclusion has been drawn that this has caused increased protein synthesis by the microbial flora of the rumen.",

Virgin (never ploughed) and cultivated sandy and silty soils from two sites in northern Norway were used in the investigation. The cultivated soils had lower air-filled porosity and gas diffusivity than the virgin ones. Application of slurry (50 Mg ha-1) decreased gas diffusivity and changed the relationship between relative diffusivity and air-filled porosity for both the virgin and cultivated sandy soils and the virgin silty soil. The gas permeability of both the virgin and cultivated silty soil was low, and the relative diffusivity at field capacity less than the limit below which plant growth is affected. ;",

    "abstract": "Tutkimus tehtiin v. 1972—1974 koko Suomesta otannalla poimituilla 325 syysruislohkolla, joiden pinta-ala oli 0.7 % maan ruisalasta. Ruista viljeltiin keskimääräistä suuremmilla tiloilla. Sitä viljeltiin suositusten mukaan etenkin kevyehköillä kivennäismailla ja keskinkertaisen kosteilla tai poutivilla mailla. Leikkuupuintia ja herbisidejä rukiin viljelylohkoilla ei ollut käytetty kovin usein. Esikasvina oli Lounais-Suomessa tavallisimmin kevätvilja tai ruis ja Väli-Suomessa nurmi tai kevätvilja. Peruslannoitukseksi annettiin karjanlantaa 30%:lle ja väkilannoitteita 92 %:lle ruislohkoista. Lajikkeet olivat yleensä alueelle suositeltuja. Kylvösiemenestä peitattiin vain 48 %, ja kylvösiementä käytettiin usein liikaa, mikä aiheutti tiheitä ja lakoontuvia kasvustoja. Kylvökausi oli liian pitkä, mistä seurasi yksittäisillä tiloilla huomattavia sadonmenetyksiä. Kahukärpästä ei torjuttu kemiallisesti eikä talvituhosieniäkään orasasteella juuri koskaan. Typpeä käytettiin kevätlannoituksessa yleensä suositellut määrät, mutta eräissä tapauksissa liikaa, kun samalla muu nykyaikainen viljelytekniikka laiminlyötiin. Ruislohkoista käsiteltiin herbisideillä 25 % ja korrenvahvisteella 15 %. Ruisalasta oli vain 0.9 % nurmen suojaviljana. Ruislohkoilta löydettiin 176 putkilokasvilajia. Lajimäärä oli suurin Itä-Suomessa. Kaikkien lajien yleisyysprosentit määritettiin. Yleisimmät lajit olivat syysyksivuotisista Viola arvensis, Stellaria media, Matricaria spp., Myosotis arvensis ja Lapsana communis, kevätyksivuotisista Chenopodium album, Galeopsis spp., Erysimum cheiranthoides, Polygonum aviculare ja P. convolvulus ja monivuotisista Ranunculus repens, Agrostis spp., Cerastium caespitosum, Phleum pratense ja Agropyron repens. Lohkoilla oli keskimäärin 303 rikkaruohoa/m2. Tiheys oli pienin Lounais-Suomessa. Kaikkien lajien yksilömäärä tai versomäärä/m2 määritettiin. Tiheimmässä kasvoivat syysyksivuotisista Viola arvensis, Stellaria media, Matricaria spp., Myosotis arvensis ja Lapsana communis, kevätyksivuotisista Galeopsis spp.,Chenopodium album ja Erysimum cheiranthoides ja monivuotisista Agrostis spp., Agropyron repens, Poa pratensis ja Ranunculus repens. Tilakoko, lohkon ikä peltona, maalaji, maaperän kosteus, leikkuupuintikertojen määrä, herbisidiruiskutusten määrä, esikasvi, kylvöaika, peittaus, kasvukauden vaihe, viljan peittävyys ja viljelyalue vaikuttivat joko suoranaisesti rikkaruohojen tiheyteen tai olivat tiheyden indikaattoreita.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to create a model depicting the growth process of a beef animal to provide means for economic optimization of the slaughter weight and of the length of the rearing period. Using data from Finnish beef rearing experiments, a model with two functions, one for weight gain and the other for feed intake, was estimated. In weight gain functions total energy and digestible crude protein were the main explanatory variables. Intake capacity of the animal was estimated as time needed to consume the dry matter quantity of a given feed input using also protein, crude fibre content and energy content of feed as explanatory variables. The model was estimated separately for Ayrshire bulls and for Friesian-Ayrshire and Charolais-Ayrshire cross-breeds. Functions of Cobb-Douglas or transcendental forms gave the best fits and turned out to be logical. Information given by the regression coefficient estimates was analyzed in detail as background for applications of the model. When dealing with the optimization problem the dynamics of production was discussed and a maximum daily profit was selected as the optimization criterion. An example was then presented to illustrate the profit maximization. Since they were of essential importance in the production economy, the feed composition and its productivity were analyzed and an example was derived to minimize the price of feed mix with maximum productivity.",

    "abstract": "The micro-DBC method (dye binding capacity) developed for single seeds is based on the FP-9 Analyzer System, which was originally developed for medical research. With a few extra devices it was adapted for seed protein micro-DBC determination. With the new analyzing system it is possible to calculate the amount of acid orange 12 dye bound by a single grain, determined per unit weight of the grain. In the FP-9 Analyzer System, nine samples are handled simultaneously at all working stages. The system includes 9-tipped pipettes, a 9-tipped automatic diluter, scales, a grinder for 9 grains, a mixer for 8 x 9 samples and a centrifuge for 4 x 9 samples, and a photometer for 9 samples as well as a programmable desk calculator connected to it. The largest volume to be pipetted is 1 ml. Twentyone barley lines, donated by Dr. L. Munck, Carlsberg Laboratory, Denmark, were studied with the FP-9 Analyzer System. From each barley line, 4—12 grains were studied. The correlation coefficient (r) between their means and the results obtained by the macro-DBC system was 0.9600***. The coefficient of variation (C.V. %) within the barley lines was 4.74 —23.28 %. With homogeneous standard flour the coefficient of variation was 1.81 —3.79 % for eight cuvette blocks with 9 samples each. The micro-DBC system has been specially developed for plant breeding purposes. Screening of material can be carried out on single or half grains in segregating early generations (F2—F5). Thus the cultivation of large line materials can partly be avoided.",

The tests showed that milk protein was decomposed rapidly and extensively in rumen fluid buffer. The heat treatment had a slight N solubility-reducing effect. Formaldehyde treatment decreased the degradation of the protein at the beginning of the incubation, but this effect became smaller as incubation proceeded. After 48 h the N solubility of the treated skimmilk powder was about the same as that of untreated spray powder. The variation in the in vitro N solubility of formaldehyde-treated skimmilk powder was greater than with the other powders and products. The skimmilk powder-wheat flour granules were hard products which remained indigestible for several hours. At the end of the microbial digestion test the addition of skimmilk powder increased the N solubility of wheat flour protein. On the basis of the results obtained from the digestion test on a pelleted skimmilk powder-barley flour product it can be assumed also that the addition of skimmilk powder caused an increase in the N solubility of barley flour protein.",

Forty growers participated in the study, which took place between 1977—80. The purpose of the study was to determine how much time was consumed in working the fallow ground and during the summer of planting, in the first fruiting year and in the next four or five growth periods. Two cultivation methods were treated separately. The whole strawberry cultivation area was 95,1 ha. In the method in which the earth surrounding the bushes was covered with a black plastic film, the total consumption of working time was 409,0 h/ha using a one-row system and 572,5 h/ha using a double-row system during the fallow period and the summer of planting. During the first fruiting year the figure was 492,5 h/ha and in the next fruiting years 1 348,5 h/ha, including the time spent on harvesting. Where mulch was applied, the corresponding averages were 235,5 h/ha, 612,5 h/ha 1 182,0 h/ha. Factors affecting the variation in the total working time between farms were studied by linear regression analysis. Factors such as e.g. total strawberry cultivation area, the number of plants per hectare and the number of the years the grower had been cultivating strawberries, did not explain the variation in the working time satisfactorily. The yield per hectare, percentage of the different varieties cultivated, planting system, cultivation and picking methods explained only 33 % of the variation in labour output of picking.",

Seeding time trials in 1976—77 consisted of three different types of varieties seeded at four different times between May 11 and June 8. In 1978 three seeding dates were tested in relation to the seeding depth of the maize. Population density studies were carried out in 1976—77. As a result of the management studies it can be concluded that the weather conditions were so unfavorable that true differences could not be found because even the best alternative in the management technique did not give a satisfactory agronomic result. Seeding dates from May 15 to May 25 can be recommended. Relatively heavy frosts in early June (—4°C to—6° C) will hurt stands but they do not kill the plant. The advance earned with early planting is thus not totally lost through the frosts Seeding depths of 5 to 7 cm are recommended. Population densities more than 10 plants/m2 are not necessary for the maximum yield. In average or better than average growing conditions the planting densities of 6 to 8 plants/m2 could yield a more mature forage crop.",

The proportion of pekilo or torula was 30% of the barley-based diet. The crude fat was determined by the standard ether extraction method and by the HCl-ether method. The first method indicated a low fat content and a highly negative digestibility of fat, but the second showed that the pig is able to digest and absorb a large part of the ether-insoluble fat. The energy value thereby increased 14 % for pekilo and 12 % for torula over those obtained by the conventional ether method. The same energy value was obtained for barley by both methods. The energy values (HCI-ether method) obtained for pekilo and torula were 0.96 and 0.95 F.U./kg DM(F. U. = 0.7 kg starch), or 13.41 and 12.98 MJ ME/kg DM, respectively. The protein values, corrected for nucleic acid nitrogen, were 434 and 358g DCP/kg DM. The only significant difference between pekilo and torula was the DCP value (P&lt; 0.001). The nitrogen balances in the pekilo and torula trials were very high and identical (24.4 and 24.0 g N/d), confirming the value of these feeds as protein supplements to cereal feeds for pigs.",

Field bean yielded 4061 kg/ha in 1976. In 1977only 2042kg/ha was harvested due to the lack of light during the grain filling period and the presense of plant diseases. Delayed seeding lowered yields in both years. Maximum yield was obtained with the seed rate of 240 kg/ha. Two weeks delay in the seeding speeded up flowering by two days. Temperature sum in degree days from seeding to emergence was 140—170°C, from seeding to flowering 618—637°C and from seeding to maturity 1670—1890°C. LAI was 5.7 for early variety and 4.3 for late variety at the time of pod setting representing very effective situation for CGR. Number and distribution of internodes, pods and seeds were primarily influenced by population density and secondly by the differences between varieties.",

The purpose of the treatment was to suppress the excess a-amylase activity in the outer layers of the kernels. The a-amylase activity following the treatment was measured by the falling number test. The increase in the falling number value was the greater the longer the treatment lasted and the higher the water temperature was. Processing lasting 30 sec at 80, 85, 90 and 100°C increased the falling number value of the one lot from 91 to 105, 117, 133 and 238 and of the other lot from 65 to 69, 70, 98, 163, respectively. As the falling numbers increased the wet gluten content of the samples decreased. These changes had a negative correlation. The gluten quality showed heat damage when the amount of gluten had dropped by about 5 and 2 precentage units in the lots with the falling numbers 91 and 65, respectively. This occurred at processing of the lot of better quality for 70, 20, 13 and 6 sec in the order of increasing temperature. The corresponding durations for the other lot were above 60, 30, 20 and 6 sec. During these treatments the falling number values rose from 91 to 104—129 and from 65 to 70—71. These results were confirmed by farinogram and extensigram determinations and by baking tests. The same processing conditions affected more severely the lot having the better initial quality than the lot with greater sprout damages.",

The effect of fertilization and that of acid irrigation solution on the amounts of anions washed out was also studied. The extraction of anions from different soils seems to correspond to that of cations; the coarser the soil, the higher the nutrient losses. This was valid for nitrate and sulfate, but the amounts of phosphate extracted were insignificant. The sum of the anion equivalents leached was lower than the respective sum of cations in all the leachates indicating that a part of the cations was leached as bicarbonate. The physical properties of the soil regulating the infiltration of water affect the movement of anions bonded non-specifically. The anions in pores of soil aggregates seem to be protected against leaching to a certain degree. However, the biological value of an anion is an important factor. It seems that microbiological processes may decrease the leaching losses of nitrate.",

    "abstract": "Udder traits are important due to their correlation with clinical mastitis which causes major economic losses to the dairy farms. Chromosomal areas associated with udder conformation traits, milking speed and leakage could be used in breeding programs to improve both udder traits and mastitis resistance. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for udder traits was carried out on bovine chromosomes (BTA) 9, 11, 14, 18, 20, 23, and 29, where earlier studies have indicated QTL for mastitis. A granddaughter design with 12 Ayrshire sire families and 360 sons was used. The sires and sons were typed for 35 markers. The traits analysed were udder depth, fore udder attachment, central ligament, distance from udder to floor, body stature, fore teat length, udder balance, rear udder height, milking speed, and leakage. Associations between markers and traits were analysed with multiple marker regression. Five genome-wise significant QTL were detected: stature on BTA14 and 23, udder balance on BTA23, rear udder height on BTA11, and central ligament on BTA23. On BTA11 and 14 the suggested QTL positions for udder traits are at the same position as previously detected QTL for mastitis and somatic cell count.;",

    "abstract": "is an eminent scientist in animal breeding with distinguished research career spanning from the mid-1950's to retirement in 1990 -and in many respect until present -reflected in over 600 articles ranging from scientific to applied subjects.Animal breeding is concerned with the analysis of variability in complex traits that are caused by several genes as well as non-genetic factors.Most traits of economic importance are of this type.Molecular genetics has opened new pastures and fields to animal breeding and its solid base quantitative genetics due to genetic mapping technology and the advent of whole genome sequences.This development is critically dependent on the foundation of knowledge laid down by Kalle's generation of animal breeders and quantitative geneticists.Understanding quantitative variability involves a combination of data collection from the farms, selection experiments, statistical analysis and mathematical modelling of genes and their effects in populations together and the environmental factors.Kalle has had a major influence on the fruitful development of these research areas in Finland.In addition to his purely scientific work, he has made many important contributions through application of research findings to animal improvement.These have had a lasting impact in the Finnish animal breeding industry.He has received both a breeding and artificial insemination organisation award in recognition of his work.Much of Kalle's work has been data analyses, using statistical tools in estimating the genetic parameters of quantitative traits in livestock populations for the purpose of designing improvement programmes for economically important traits.Of especial importance has been his thesis work on fertility traits in dairy cattle.This seminal study had challenges in finding good data, appropriate statistical methods and sufficient computing capacity.His pioneering actions in purchasing bigger and new types of computer technology are legendary within MTT.Kalle has made some very influential contributions to our understanding of breeding objectives.He laid down in 1976 a useful framework for analysing the long-term goals for animal breeding.The analysis was founded on potential for feed production and demand to satisfy the basic nutritional demands of consumers.He considered 'biological efficiency -especially in protein production -as the main aim in animal production' and raised doubts about the use of often uncertain economic factors in long-term analyses.Thus, 'milk production is the most effective way of producing animal protein', mainly due to the ability to convert grass to milk protein.The work also clearly showed the caveats in the efficiency of the supply chain of animal products.Such ideas lent themselves to constructing selection profiles in all the Finnish livestock species.Kalle has not hesitated to get involved.His coffee break chatting in Edinburgh triggered worldwide interest in the prolific Finnsheep.His worry about losing native Finnish cattle breeds took him quickly to European, Nordic and Finnish committees on genetic diversity of farm animal species, well before the",

    "abstract": "Agricultural and Food Science starts its 16th volume with this issue of seven volunteered papers.In our journal it is the first issue ever in which majority of the papers is written by authors from outside Finland, the country of origin of this journal.In this issue, the papers are from Croatia, Estonia, Poland and Portugal, one from each, and three from Finland.The geographical distribution of papers published reflects the development in the submitted manuscripts, which increasingly come from countries other than Finland and even outside the Baltic region.After becoming fully electronic and available through the online service of Ingenta (www.ingentaconnect.com) in 2004, the number of submissions has increased steadily and reached 139 in 2006 (116 in 2005, 94 in 2004), the increase being predominantly from abroad.Some of the readers may wonder how this distribution of published papers agrees with \"publication of papers of international interest but featuring a northern perspective\", as stated in the Instructions to authors (www.mtt.fi/afs/about.html and www.mtt.fi/afs/instructions.html).According to our consideration, the \"northern perspective\" does not necessarily mean that the research has been carried out in boreal or temperate environments.However, the contents of the papers must have some applicability to the boreal environment.Often those papers introduce some new research methodology, or test agricultural practices, foods or feeding stuffs used also in the nordic areas, or present phenomena which are relevant in the nordic areas as well.This may be the best clarification available for authors about the meaning of the \"nordic perspective\".In 2006, Agricultural and Food Science had 122 experts reviewing the manuscripts.Their geographic distribution was as follows: Finland 22, other Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Estonia) 38, the rest of Europe 38, USA, Canada and Mexico 22, and Oceania 1.The journal wants to thank all the referees, listed at the end of the previous issue.Without their generous help and devotion, production of a quality scientific journal would be impossible.Last year Agricultural and Food Science published 30 papers.Our journal, like many other rather small journals, is hampered by a low impact factor, fluctuating from year to year.According to the Journal Citation Reports, the impact factor of our journal was 0.255 for 2005, ranging in previous years up to 0.519.At this point, the impact factor for 2006 is not yet available.The impact factor for 2005 was calculated on the basis of those 13 citations made in 2005 to papers published in our journal in 2003 and 2004.A more comprehensive analysis of the citation report revealed that in 2005 there were, however, altogether as many as 160 citations to the papers published in Agricultural and Food Science.Mostly, they had been published in years 1998-2001, a period not used in the calculation of the recent impact factor.Agricultural sciences, often based on field experiments, do have a slower pace of publishing than some other sciences more keen on emphasising the impact factor as the principal index of a journal.Therefore, most manuscripts that will refer to the very recent papers of our journal, are still under preparation or in the review process.Moreover, the abstracts, freely available in the Ingenta online service, were read 3300 times in January through November 2006.Taking this into account, we think that our papers are well read and used as references at a reasonable level.The fact that citations are made to papers published to slightly older volumes (cited half-life 5.9 years), on the contrary, shows that those papers have had permanent value over the years.I wish all the readers interesting moments with our journal.",

In Finland, Se supplementary feeding and Se-enriched macronutrient fertilisers are used in conventional farming because the Se availability from soil is extremely low. The objective of this study was to improve Se concentration in organic milk by replacing sodium selenite (SS) in mineral-vitamin mixture with selenium yeast (SY) either completely or partly (50/50). The feeding experiment was conducted on 15 certified organic dairy farms in Eastern Finland during spring 2008. The cross-over design consisted of three treatments (SS treatment, SY treatment, and SS/SY treatment), three experimental periods (28 days each), and three farm groups (different order of treatments). Replacing SS with the same amount (0.2 mg Se kg-1 feed dry matter) of SY more than doubled Se concentration in organic milk and their mixture resulted in slightly lower Se concentrations. In conclusion, SY supplementary feeding is needed to improve Se concentration in organic milk and Se supply to cows, their calves, and consumers.",

Measures, where further improvement is necessary, are, e.g., setting of environmental quality standards for all active substances, and monitoring of surface and ground waters for PPP residues, which has suffered from a lack of resources during the NAP period. Overall screening of the sustainability goals revealed progress in all aspects, though targeting, resourcing, and monitoring remained the area with least progress compared to the same screening conducted in 2015. The perception of the experts on the constraints that limit the fulfilment of the NAP most seriously remained similar compared to their views in 2014.",

    "abstract": "In this study, dried chicken slices were packaged in MAP (modified atmosphere packaging) and AP (atmospheric packaging), and stored at 4 °C and 25 °C. The CO2 content of MAP packaged samples decreased as the storage temperature and time increased. The slices exhibited lower aw values when they were packaged in AP at 25 °C. The pH increased from 6.1 to 6.2, 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) increased from 10.6 to 37.3 µmol MDA kg-1, and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) increased from 4.9 to 5.3 g 100 g-1 in MAP for 90 days of storage. The microbiological quality of the samples was assessed by enumerating total aerobic mesophilic bacteria (TAMB), total psychrophilic bacteria (TPB), Micrococcus/ Staphylococcus, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Enterobacteriaceae and yeast-mold, and was higher in the sample stored in MAP at 4 °C. Moreover, the sensory quality was determined by sensory evaluation with a 9-point hedonic scale. When the sensory and microbiological qualities were evaluated together, the shelf lives of the samples were determined to be 90 days at 4 °C and 75 days at 25 °C for MAP and 45 days at 4 °C and 30 days at 25 °C for AP. It could be concluded that the cold dried chicken slices can be stored in MAP for 90 days without much change in physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory quality.",

Due to considerable input of nutrientsvia dung and urine, horse paddocks can be significant sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) and reactive nitrogen (N)-gases. However, horse paddocks have not been studied intensively in contrast to e.g., dairy cow pastures. Here we report GHG emissions from one selected horse paddock in Eastern Finland. During the first year, GHG emissions from the site and surrounding grassland area were measured with closed static chamber method. In the following year soil samples were taken from the sites to study GHG emission and reactive N-gas (nitrous acid and nitric oxide) emissions in the laboratory. The paddock area emitted significant amounts of N-gases and methane compared with surrounding areas during wet season. N-gas emissions also increased with increasing soil mineral N concentration. We conclude that horse paddocks can be significant but local sources of greenhouse gases and wet soil conditions should be avoided to mitigate the emissions.",

In this study, we report the first observations of D. suzukii in Finland. The first trap catches of SWD were observed in 2019 in North Savo at a berry farm that handles imported berries. In 2020–2021, no adult flies were trapped at or near the farm, but in August 2022, adult SWDs were caught at the same farm. In 2023, one female of the same haplotype as the flies in previous year was found in mid July, but no further population growth was observed. This suggests that some overwintering events may happen, but lack of overwintered males may hinder the population growth. In 2021–2022, larvae and eggs of SWD were found in several batches of imported berries. Our results suggest that there is a pathway of introduction for SWD up to the farm level. Observed SWD adults in 2022 probably originated from a new introduction rather than an overwintered population, because no SWDs were observed during the two preceding seasons. Identification of D. suzukii specimens was confirmed with PCR and sequencing of the COI region, and four SWD haplotypes were found.",

Eight control embryos were cultured for 2 h before transfer to recipient mares. The recipient mares were scanned for pregnancies every other day starting 6 days after transfer. Twenty days after the transfer the pregnant recipient mares received luprostiol to induce abortion of the foetus. The pregnancy rate 6 days after transfer was 82% in the treatment group, and 75% in the control group (P&gt;0.05). One DAPI-stained embryo resorbed and was no longer visible 12 days after transfer. However, this particular recipient mare had a uterine inflammation as shown by examination in the oestrus following embryo transfer. Although the number of embryos is insufficient to demonstrate lack of treatment effect, the high pregnancy rates following DAPI staining should encourage further studies on this subject.",

Selection for protein yield changes the protein to fat ratio to desirable direction by increasing the protein content and decreasing the fat content. Changes in constituents are small though.

Samaan peltolohkoon muokattiin kolmena vuotena peräkkäin edellisenä varastokautena kokeista tulleita sairaita sipuleita n. 10 tn/ha/v. Tässä voimakkaasti saastuneessa maassa ja samalla peltoaukeamalla 100—200 m:n etäisyydellä kasvatettiin sipuleita maasta tapahtuvan saastunnan toteamiseksi. Toisessa kokeessa sipulisatoa korjattiin elokuun puolivälistä syyskuun loppuun kymmenen vuorokauden välein. Osa korjatuista sipuleista ruiskutettiin yksi viikko ennen nostoa benomyylillä. Kolmannessa kokeessa verrattiin koneellisesti ja käsin nostetun sipulisadon B. allii -pitoisuuksia toisiinsa. B. allii -sieni saastutti sipuleita maasta käsin vasta kolmantena koevuotena. Myöhäinen sadonkorjuuaika lisäsi vain lievästi sadon harmaahomeisuutta. Jos käytetty istukas oli tervettä, ei myöhäisellä sadonkorjuulla ollut vaikutusta tautisuuteen. Yksi viikko ennen sadonkorjuutatehdyillä fungisidiruiskutuksilla ei ollut vaikutusta B. allii -pitoisuuksiin. Koneellinen sadonkorjuuketju pellolta varastoon ei näyttänyt lisäävän sipulin harmaahometta käsinnostoon verrattuna.",

Further, the efficiency of chloride and sulphate solutions of equal anion concentration (0.1 M) was compared. At a constant ionic strength, P desorption was enhanced as the sulphate concentration of the extractant increased. Even despite a much higher ionic strength the extraction power of the K2SO4 solution was greater than that of the KCI solution of the same anion concentration. Comparison of the 0.1 M and 0.033 M K2SO4 solutions revealed in 53 soil samples the extractability of P to be depressed by an increase in sulphate concentration (and ionic strength). In 49 samples, on the contrary, the 0.1 M K2SO4 solution extracted equal or greater P amounts than did the 0.033 M K2SO4. It was observed that the lower the P coverage on the oxide surfaces in the soil was, the more obviously the promoting effect of increasing sulphate concentration overruled the depression induced by increasing ionic strength, and the more superior the K2SO4 solution was as compared to the KCI solution.",

Fermentation of sugars and moulding could be inhibited in plant juices by adding 0.5 % v/w preservative, but proteolysis continued and true protein was degraded in unheated juices. Ensiling losses of pea juice were considerable, 4.0-15.6 % of DM, in all treatments. For wet leaf protein concentrate precipitated by steaming (85°C), good preservation could be obtained with the additives used in silage making applied at a level of 1 % v/w.

The rank correlation between field assessments from naturally infected plots and assessment from artificially inoculated small screening plots was moderately high.

By using the ratio of chloride soluble P to sulphate soluble P (”Cl-P”/”SO4-P”) instead of absolute differences it was possible to find out a more accurate relationship between soil properties and varying extraction efficiency of salt solutions. In the soils of low P intensity, the extractability ratio of P (”Cl-P’/”SO4-P”) seemed to decrease with an increase in the molar ratio of NH4F soluble P (CHANG and JACKSON’s method) to oxalate extractable Al, which indicates the improvement of the relative replacement power of sulphate. Conversely, in the samples of high or medium P intensity an increase in NH4F-P/AI had an opposite effect: the ratio ”Cl-P”/ √(”S04-P”) rather than ”Cl-P”/”SO4-P” was raised, suggesting a marked depression in the efficiency of sulphate. The superiority of sulphate, as compared to chloride, tended to be reduced also with increasing soil pH; the decrease seemed to be the greater the poorer the P status of the soil was. A theory explaining the variation in the relative extraction power of chloride and sulphate solutions was presented and the possible contributory influence of point of zero charge (pzc) was discussed.",

Tällöin todettiin, että syysvehnää viljeltiin yleensä suurilla tiloilla, vanhoilla pelloilla, savimailla, suurilla lohkoilla ja lähellä talouskeskusta. Syysvehnälohkoilla oli käytetty ennen syysvehnän viljelyä hyvin usein leikkuupuimuria ja herbisidejä. Esikasvina oli tavallisimmin syysvehnä tai muu vilja, vaikka neuvonta vastusti monokulttuuria. Peruslannoituksessa noudatettiin yleensä ohjeita, jopa ylitettiinkin suositellut käyttömäärät. Lajikesuosituksia yleensä noudatettiin ja uudet lajikkeet otettiin käyttöön muutamassa vuodessa. Kasvinsuojelu, varsinkin peittaus laiminlyötiin usein. Rikkaruohoruiskutuksissa olisi tullut käyttää useammin seosvalmisteita ja oikeata ruiskutusaikaa. Kylvösiemenmäärä oli usein ylisuuri ja kylvökausi liian pitkä, mistä aiheutui yksittäisillä tiloilla haittoja ja sadonmenetyksiä. Valistuneimpien viljelijöiden tiloilla neuvontaa seurattiin ja noudatettiinkin melko nopeasti, mutta osa viljeli perinnäisiä tapojen noudattaen. Helppotajuinen neuvonta otettiin vastaan nopeammin kuin vaikeatajuinen. Neuvonnassa tulisi kiinnittää enemmän huomiota tilakohtaiseen neuvontaan. Syysvehnälohkoilta tavattiin 130 rikkaruoholajia, joista 26 esiintyi yli 16 %:lla peltolohkoista. Rikkaruohoja oli keskimäärin 257 yksilöä tai versoa/ m2. Tiheimmässä kasvoivat syysyksivuotisista Viola arvensis, Matricaria spp., Stellaria media, Lapsana communis ja Myosotis arvensis, kevätyksivuotisista Galeopsis spp., Chenopodium album, Erysimum cheiranthoides, Polygonum aviculare, Myosurus minimus, Gnaphalium uliginosum ja Polygonum convolvulus, ja monivuotisista Agropyron repens. Rikkaruohokoostumus poikkesi ruispeltojen rikkaruohokoostumuksesta joten neuvonnan tulisi kohdistua viljelykasvikohtaiseen neuvontaan. Rikkaruohojen tiheyteen vaikuttivat mm. lohkon etäisyys talouskeskuksesta, lohkon ikä peltona, maalaji, maaperän kosteus, leikkuupuintikertojen määrä, herbisidikäsittelyjen määrä, esikasvi, kylvöaika, kasvukauden vaihe ja viljan peittävyys. Tekijät eivät aina vaikuttaneet suoranaisesti vaan olivat todellisten tekijöiden indikaattoreita.",

The ration digestibility decreased with increasing levels of wood molasses. The difference in DM and organic matter(OM) digestibility was significant (P &lt; 0.05) between DB and WMB16. Wood molasses tended to decrease the apparent digestibility of crude protein and crude fibre and to increase nitrogen retention.

Experiments were made with muscle homogenates, to which antibiotics were added, and whole fish and fillets, treated by means of dips in antibiotic solutions and storage in antibiotic ice. The temperatures studied were 2°C and 10°C. The antibiotics employed were chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline. It was observed that the antibiotics improved the keeping quality of Baltic herring. In dipping treatments, and in experiments with muscle homogenates, the favorable effect of the antibiotic was observable even at the early phase of the storage, whereas when antibiotic ice was used such effect was only discovered after about one week’s storage. In a comparison of chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline no essential differences were observed in their effectivity.",

This was done by using two methods parallelly: HÄNSEL’s sandbed method, which shows the genetic susceptibility of the varieties; and the »nature method» which elicits the effect of ear type. The results led to the following conclusions: Both methods gave similar results, indicating that the differences in genetic susceptibility to sprouting in the ear (between the varieties) are so great that they emerged by both methods used. The classification of the material into four groups, hairy erect, hairy nutant, bald erect and bald nutant, showed that the ear type has its own importance as a factor reducing sprouting. The bald ear was found to be better than the hairy and the nutant superior to the erect ear. The disadvantage of hairy ears is obviously connected with their greater water-retaining capacity. Owing to this they germinate more readily, especially in conditions in which the water capacity of the ears is only occasionally optimal for sprouting as is often the case in the field during the ripening period when the weather keeps changing.",

    "abstract": "In planning the marketing of blackcurrant juice, a material which has been studied in our laboratory for years (cf. 7, 8, 9), it is important to find a favourable solution to the problems arising with respect to storage and transport containers. The materials most commonly used today for this purpose, glass and plastic, have certain disadvantages, viz. the fragility and weight of glass, and the aroma loss which often occurs in plastic containers. Particularly in cases of long-distance transport, such as in exportation, the question of the most suitable packaging of the juice still presents a problem. Experience of the tinplate can is very limited in this respect. Its mechanical properties are well suited for the purpose, but its chemical suitability is less certain. Tinplate, which is tinned steel plate, is corroded by acid products, especially in the presence of free oxygen, and this may have results which are fatal both to the quality of the product and to the can. Corrosion may be prevented by using cans coated inside with acid-fast lacquers, but in practice the product does, nevertheless, generally come into direct contact with the metal at the sites of scratches and pores in the lacquer film. In addition to acids, blackcurrant juice contains also an ample measure of colouring matters of the anthocyan type; these combine with tin ions, dissolved by the acids from the plate, forming unpleasant looking insoluble compounds. Iron dissolved in the content of the can may also induce colour changes in the anthocyans. The practical purpose of the present study is to settle the question of whether lacquered tinplate cans are suitable for the storage of blackcurrant juice, and to determine the importance of the effect of scratches in the lacquer film on the quality of the juice.",

Tämän useimmilta muiltakin ominaisuuksiltaan hyväksi osoittautuneen lajikkeen viljely laajeni voimakkaasti 1930-luvulla, ja se oli jo v. 1939 syrjäyttänyt maatiaisperuna Haalikaisen valta-asemasta Mikkelinläänin maanviljelysseuran alueella.

Kaikki kolme kokeissa mukana ollutta valmistetta, Phosfon D, CCC ja Amo 1618, hillitsivät krysanteemin kasvua. Kasvun heikkeneminen kuitenkin vaihteli käytetyn valmistemäärän mukaan. Amo 1618 hillitsi tehokkaimmin pituuskasvua, mutta myöhästytti ja vähensi samalla kukintaa. Kun valmistetta käytettiin 3 g tai vähemmän 100 multalitraa kohti, kehittyivät kasvit liian tuuheiksi (taulukot 3, 7, 9). Phosfon D:n ja CCC:n kasvua hillitsevä vaikutus jäi selvästi vähäisemmäksi kuin päivän lyhentämisestä aiheutunut kasvun heikkeneminen, joka oli n. 47 % (taulukot 1, 2). CCC:n teho oli suurimmillaan 13 %. Phosfon D vaikutti jonkin verran enemmän ja on todennäköistä, että se korkeakasvuisemmilla lajikkeilla antaa selvemmän tuloksen. Latvottujen taimien kukintojen määrä aleni sekä CCC- että Phosfon D-käsittelyn johdosta (taulukko 3). Sensijaan krysanteemin kukintojen kokoon ei kyseisillä aineilla havaittu olevan vaikutusta. Phosfon D:n ja Amo 1618:n teho krysanteemiin oli suurin hiekkaan ja turpeeseen sekoitettuna. Savipitoisessa mullassa Phosfon D:n teho jäi viidenteen osaan siitä, mitä se oli hiekassa ja turpeessa (taulukko 4). Joulutähden käsittelystä antoi parhaan tuloksen CCC. Sillä käsitellyt taimet jäivät 37 % matalammiksi kuin käsittelemättömät. Phosfon D:ta oli käytettävä varsin suuria määriä joulutähden käsittelyyn ennenkuin kasvua hillitsevä teho saavutettiin. Ainekäsittelyn johdosta joulutähden suojuslehdet (kukat) kehittyivät epämuotoisiksi (taulukko 9). Amo 1618 vaikutus oli selvästi haitallisempi kuin CCC:n. Sitäpaitsi viimeksi mainitun haittavaikutus suojuslehtien muotoon väheni, kun käsittely suoritettiin 2 viikon kuluttua pistokastaimien istutuksesta. Tällöin tosin oli pituuskasvua hillitsevä teho jonkinverran heikompi kuin istutuksen yhteydessä suoritetulla käsittelyllä.",

It was found that the solubility of »myosin» was lowered only in broilers frozen without aging, after 1 month of storage. Simultaneously, water-binding capacity was lowered, and the meat proved tough by organoleptic test. Prolonged frozen storage, by contrast, caused no loss in solubility of »myosin».

En betydande ökning av traktorernas användningstid kan sålunda fastslås ha ägt rum. Traktorerna utnyttjades under den senare perioden på ett betydligt mångsidigare sätt än under den förra perioden. Den mångsidiga användningen kommer till uttryck främst genom en ökad insats av traktorerna i sådd och gödselspridning, skötsel av grödan, skörd av grödan och transporter. Samtidigt, som det är uppenbart, att traktorernas insats är större och mångsidigare på större gårdar än på mindre, tyder resultaten på, att en fortgående traktorisering medför, att skillnaden mellan mindre och större bokföringsgårdar synes öka, då man uttrycker traktoriseringens omfattning genom timåtgången per gård. De gårdar, som deltagit i bägge undersökningarna, representerar gårdar som år 1958 nått fram till en mera avancerad traktorisering än vad fallet är med samtliga i undersökningen år 1958 deltagande gårdar. Det faktum, att traktoranvändningen på dessa gårdar ökat mycket mera än vad en jämförelse mellan traktoranvändningen på samtliga gårdar åren 1950—52 respektive 1958 ger vid banden, talar för att goda möjligheter, att effektivare utnyttja traktorer föreligger överhuvudtaget på gårdar, som befinner sig i ett begynnande traktoriseringsskede. En skenbart motsägande bild lämnar emellertid timåtgångens utveckling i storleksgruppen S-F IV. Det förefaller som om man vid en utökning av antalet traktorer per gård inte mera lika effektivt utnyttjar traktorerna som fallet var då gårdarna höll sig med färre traktorer.",

    "abstract": "The investigation is a report of the results from determinations of the volume weight of the organic matter in the plough layer of cultivated peat lands. They are believed to justify the following conclusions. As a consequence of continued cultivation through several decades, the volume weight of the organic matter in the plough layer increases. Owing to the fact that cultivation also adds plant residues and root substance to the soil of the plough layer, this increase cannot be positively attributed to the favourable effect of the cultivation measures on the humification of the peat alone, though this effect is certainly thought to be at least partially responsible. The increase of the volume weight is also thought to be one of the reasons why peat lands in the course of continued cultivation gradually evolve a closer resemblance to humus soil. The cultivation methods influence the change in volume weight of the organic matter. Fertilizing, liming and addition of mineral soil for soil improvement usually produce an increase in the volume weight.",

    "abstract": "Kevätvilja (tutkittu 3 kaura-, 3 ohra- ja 2 kevätvehnälajiketta) on kehittynyt kylvöstä täydelle tähkälle (röyhylle) keskimäärin nopeammin Viikin (60° 10' N) kuin Muddusniemen (69° 5' N) koetilalla. Kehityksen nopeuden vaihtelu vuodesta toiseen oli selvästi suurempi Muddusniemessä; siellä todettiin kevätviljan kehityksen nopeuden kummankin suuntaiset ääriarvot, siis sekä nopein että hitain kehitys. Eri kevätviljalajikkeiden kehityksen nopeus oli molemmilla koepaikoilla yleensä keskenään samansuuntainen. Aikaisimmat ohralajikkeet olivat kuitenkin Muddusniemessä suhteellisesti ehkä hiukan vielä aikaisemmat kuin Viikissä. Kehityksen ensimmäinen vaihe, kylvöstä orastumiseen, oli Muddusniemen kevätviljakokeissa nopeampi kuin Viikissä. Kolmas kehitysvaihe, tähkän (röyhyn) kärjen ilmaantumisesta täydelle tähkälle (röyhylle) oli molemmissa koepaikoissa keskenään jokseenkin yhtä pitkä. Sen sijaan orastumisesta tähkän (röyhyn) kärjen ilmaantumiseen kehittyi kevätvilja Viikissä huomattavasti nopeammin kuin Muddusniemessä. Kevätviljan määrättyjä kehitysvaiheita vastaavat lämpöasteiden summat olivat Viikissä säännöllisesti suuremmat kuin Muddusniemessä. Tämä ero ilmeni pienimpänä orastumisen ja tähkän (röyhyn) kärjen ilmaantumisen välisenä aikana. Koetulosten tarkastelussa kiinnitetään huomiota siihen, että kevätviljan juuri se kehitysvaihe, orastumisesta tähkän (röyhyn) kärjen ilmaantumiseen, jolloin päivän pituus vaikuttaa kevätviljan kehitykseen, on ollut lyhyempi Viikissä (60° 10' N) kuin Muddusniemessä (69° 5' N). Myös tätä kehitysastetta vastaava lämpöasteiden summa on Viikissä ilmennyt suhteellisen pienenä. Näin ollen on ilmeistä, että päivän pituuden ja lämpötilan ohella myös joillakin muilla ekologisilla tekijöillä on ollut huomattava vaikutus kevätviljan kehityksen nopeuteen. Erityisesti on kiinnitetty huomiota valon voimakkuuteen, joka Viikissä on suurempi ja maaperän laatuun, joka todennäköisesti on Muddusniemessä kevätviljan nopealle kehitykselle suotuisampi. Sitä paitsi näyttää siltä, että kevätviljan kylvön ja täydelle tähkälle (röyhylle) tulon välisen ajan lämpöasteiden summa muodostuu samallakin leveyspiirillä pienimmäksi yleensä silloin kun lämpötila on verraten alhainen.",

Hehtaarisatojen muutoksille olivat epäsäännölliset, lähinnä sääoloista johtuvat vuosivaihtelut luonteenomaisia. Eri kasvien satovaihtelu oli, ilmaistuna vaihtelukertoimella, 13—21 %. Satovaihtelu oli suurin perunalla ja pienin syysrukiilla. Satotason kehitys oli eri kasveilla pääpiirteissään sama. Hehtaarisadot kohosivat 1920- ja 1930-luvulla varsin tasaisesti, mutta laskivat sotavuosina. Alimmilleen satotaso laski 1940-luvun puolivälissä, peltoheinällä jo aikaisemmin. Laskukautta seurasi satojen jyrkkä nousu, joka palautti tason suunnilleen sotia edeltäneelle suhteellisen korkealle tasolle. Hehtaarisatojen kehityksen pääsuunta on ollut nouseva. Keskimääräinen sadonlisäys oli, huomioon ottaen vuodet 1921—60 sangen pieni, 0.2–1.1 % vuodessa. Pääasiallisena syynä tähän oli satojen lasku sota- ja säännöstelyvuosina. Huomattavasti suurempi, keskimäärin 1.3—3.7 %, oli lisäys laskukauden jälkeen vuosina 1946—60. Sadon nousu oli suurin kauralla ja pienin syysrukiilla ja perunalla.",

    "abstract": "Tutkimus on jatkoa aikaisemmin julkaistuille kokeille (3, 4). Lehmillä ja hiehoilla suoritettiin kummillakin v. 1959 neljä koetta ja v. 1960 kolme koetta. Kaikki rehusuolat olivat vapaasti saatavissa katollisissa kaukaloissa laitumella. V. 1959 suoritetut kokeet. Kokeissa I oli lehmillä ja hiehoilla saatavana rehusuolaseosta IV, luujauhoja ja ruokasuolaa. Lehmät oli jaettu kahteen ryhmään: runsastuottoisiin ja vähätuottoisiin. Tässä kokeessa vähätuottoisten ryhmä söi eläintä kohden runsaammin muita kivennäisrehuja paitsi ruokasuolaa kuin runsastuottoisten ryhmä. Syy siihen voi olla peräisin edelliseltä sisäruokintakaudelta ja laidunlohkojen erilaisuudesta. Vrt. koe I 1960. Hiehoilla oli muiden kivennäisrehujen paitsi ruokasuolan kulutus keskimäärin suurempi kuin lehmillä. 50 % mononatriumfosfaattia seoksessa tekee sen halutuksi. Kokeissa II oli saatavana rehusuolaseosta V ja VI, luujauhoja ja ruokasuolaa. Seoksen V sisältämä 41 % dinatriumfosfaattimäärä tai kalajauho on ilmeisesti tehnyt sen lehmille tämän kokeen halutuimmaksi rehuksi. Dinatriumfosfaatti ei ole kuitenkaan yhtä haluttua kuin mononatriumfosfaatti. Seoksen VI sisältämä 15 % mononatriumfosfaattimäärä ei ole ollut riittävä tekemään seosta hyvin maittavaksi. Hiehot söivät kuitenkin hieman paremmin seosta VI kuin seosta V. Johtuuko luujauhojen tavallista pienempi kulutus tässä kokeessa mahdollisesti seoksen V sisältämistä kalajauhoista, sitä ei voida päätellä tämän kokeen perusteella. Molemmathan sisältävät myös orgaanisia aineita mm. valkuaista. Kokeissa III oli saatavana ruokintakalkkia, rehuliitua, ruokintafosfaattia ja ruokasuolaa. Rehuliitu on tuskin ruokintakalkkia maittavampaa, koska kumpaakaan lehmät eivät syöneet ollenkaan ja hiehotkin vain hyvin vähän. Rehufosfaattikaan ei ole haluttua rehua pelkältään, kuten jo aikaisemmissakin kokeissa on todettu. Kokeissa IV oli saatavana rehusuolaseosta I pelkältään, seosta I + 10 % melassileikettä, seosta I + 10 % kaurajauhoja tai seosta I + 10 % vehnänleseitä. Hiehoilta puuttui viimeksimainittu seos. Rehut oli sekoitettu seoksen I kanssa. Vehnänlese teki seoksen halutuimmaksi lehmillä. Melassileike ja kaurajauho ovat olleet saman veroiset. Runsaampi syönti tapahtui pääasiassa kuitenkin vain 10 ensimmäisen päivän aikana. Tässä kokeessa saivat lehmät olosuhteiden pakosta lypsyn yhteydessä runsaasti väkirehuja, joten laidunruokinnalla väkirehuista ja kivennäisrehuista tehdyt seokset voivat olla paremmin haluttuja. Hiehot söivät paremmin rehusuolaseosta, johon oli sekoitettu kaurajauhoja kuin melassileikkeestä ja rehusuolaseoksesta tehtyä seosta. Kulutus oli suurempi kuitenkin vain 10 ensimmäisen päivän aikana. Lehmillä vertailtiin samassa kokeessa myös hienon ja hyvin karkean ruokasuolan syöntiä. Hienoa suolaa ne söivät runsaammin kuin karkeata. V. 1960 suoritetut kokeet. Kokeissa I verrattiin rehusuolaseoksen IV (50 % mononatriumfosfaattia, 40 % rehufosfaattia) ja mononatriumfosfaatin syöntiä toisiinsa. Eläimet söivät halukkaammin jälkimmäistä kuin edellistä. Jos sitä ei ole eläimillä saatavissa, syövät ne runsaita määriä myös ensiksi mainittua (koe I 1959, III 1960). Tässä kokeessa runsastuottoiset lehmät söivät kivennäisrehuja runsaammin kuin vähätuottoiset. Kokeissa II ei annttu ruokasuolaa erikseen kuten kaikissa muissa kokeissa, vaan sellaista seosta, johon oli lisätty 29.6 % ruokasuolaa. Seoksen muut pääaineosat olivat huonosti maittavia. Lehmät ja hiehot haluavat syödä laitumella ruokasuolaa, ja jos sitä ei ole vapaasti saatavissa, ne syövät seosta, jossa sitä on runsaasti. NaCl:n syönti jäi tässä kokeessa kuitenkin normaalia pienemmäksi. Kokeissa III verrattiin ruokintakalkin ja -dolomiitin syöntiä sekä lehmillä hienon ja tavallisen (keskikarkea) ruokasuolan syöntiä. Kummassakaan vertailussa lehmillä ei saatu eroja. Hiehot söivät enemmän ruokintakalkkia kuin -dolomiittia ja runsaammin kuin lehmät muita kivennäisrehuja paitsi ruokasuolaa. Tähän asti suoritetuista kokeista (v. 1957—60) voidaan todeta, että nautakarja syö kivennäisrehuja vapaasti laitumella hyvin erilaisia määriä riippuen pääasiassa siitä mitä kivennäisrehuja käytetään. Kalsiumpitoisista kivennäisrehuista ovat ruokintakalkki, liitu, -dolomiitti ja rehufosfaatti lehmille huonosti maittavia, kun taas luujauho on paremmin maittavaa rehua. Sekoittamalla huonosti maittavat rehut esim. mononatriumfosfaatin kanssa, syövät eläimet niitä runsaasti. Hiehot syövät em. rehuja pelkältäänkin runsaammin kuin lehmät. Kokeissa käytetyistä fosforipitoisista kivennäisrehuista on mononatriumfosfaatti halutuin fosforirehu. Sen määrästä seoksessa riippuu kuinka haluttua seos on. Keskinkertaisen haluttuja fosforirehuja ovat luujauhot ja dinatriumfosfaatti. Huonoimmin syöty rehu on ollut rehufosfaatti pelkältään. Ruokasuolaa haluaa nautakarja syödä laitumella. Jos kivennäusrehut sisältävät runsaasti natriumfosfaatteja, on ruokasuolan kulutus niiden sisältämän natriumin vuoksi vähäisempää, mutta kuitenkin syödyn natriumin kokonaismäärä on yleensä suurempi kuin ruokasuolaa yksinään natriumrehuna käytettäessä. Jos ruokasuolaa ei anneta vapaasti, vaan se sekoitetaan pääasiassa ruokintakalkkia ja rehufosfaattia sisältävään seokseen, jää syöty natriumkloridimäärä pieneksi.",

    "abstract": "In Finland damping-off of sugar beet can be divided into two distinct phases. The first phase begins with the germination of the seeds and continues until the first true leaves have developed. Under field conditions seedlings usually remain healthy up to about 1 week after emergence. Thereafter a sudden outbreak of damping-off may occur, resulting in rapid wilting and death of seedlings. During the second phase of the disease, when seedlings have one or more pairs of true leaves, disease does not always result in the death of the plant; plants may survive throughout the summer. At the pernicious phase of the disease the soil borne pathogen, Pythium debaryanum auct. non Hesse, is the most common causal agent, accounting in 1979—86 for 53.9 % (variation between years 18.3—90.1 %) of fungal isolations, and Fusarium species for 28.3 % (5.0—58.5 %). At seedling stages with one or more pairs of true leaves Fusarium spp. predominate accounting for 49.4 % (36.1—81.0 %) as compared to 23,9 % (2.9—37.8) for P. debaryanum. The importance of Fusarium species as true damping-off pathogens is, however, doubtful. The seed borne damping-off pathogen Phoma betae Frank was isolated only in 0 to 4 % and was not dependent on the stage of seedling development. Of the factors affecting damping-off, high temperatures were repeatedly shown to increase the disease. This, presumably was an effect especially on P. debaryanum, the aggressiveness of which is strongly increased at high temperatures. Pot experiments showed preceding crops of cereals to have the best disease-decreasing effect, both short-term (one growing period of preceding crop) and long-term (several growing periods of preceding crop) effect. Legumes kept the level of damping-off unchanged or even raised it, especially as a short-term effect. The influence of preceding crops varied in different soil types. Preceding crops also caused considerable fluctuations in inoculum density (0 to 3650 propagules/gram soil) and potential (0.2—16 IPU 50/gram soil) of Pythium. The correlation to damping-off of sugar beet was, however, poor. Seed treatment with the systemic fungicide hymexazol, especially when combined with thiram, prevented satisfactorily the pernicious type of damping-off. In many experiments this seed treatment repeatedly decreased disease incidence significantly, produced denser stands (7100—31200 numbers of beets more/hectare) and increased yield by 5—10 % on average.",

    "abstract": "A simple kit for rapid detection of potato virus Y by latex serological test was developed. The test is carried out on a white cardboard sheet and the results can be read by naked eye in two minutes. A test card of 10 x 6 cm holds latex sensitized antibodies, buffers and other necessary ingredients as dry blue colored formulate on the ringed areas of the card. A test card includes space for six tests and positive and negative controls. The kit also includes disposable plastic sticks for mixing the samples with test reagents and a hand press with disposable plastic tips. For testing, dried reagents are dissolved in drops of sample and mixed. After gentle rotation, samples containing virus appear clearly granulated while samples from healthy plants remain unagglutinated. The testing of undiluted extracts of evenly developed tuber sprouts resulted in over 91 % identity with the results obtained with ELISA that was used as a control method. Testing of diluted leaf extracts reached the same reliability but undiluted leaf extracts from glasshouse grown potatoes were not well suitable as test samples because of their dark green color. No such problems occurred with field grown material and a complete identity with the ELISA readings was true when the samples included secondarily infected potato plants. No reaction to other potato viruses than PVY was obtained by the test kit.",

    "abstract": "Rapid technological change in agriculture has permitted the management of larger farms with an existing labour input. Following this the demand for supplementary arable land has grown considerbly, while the supply has remained low. This imbalance between demand and supply has been reflected in rising land prices. For that reason, the main aim of this study was to determine the capitalized and market value of supplementary arable land and the correlations between them. The determination of the capitalized value of supplementary arable land is based on the use of production function analysis. The marginal value product was estimated from a Cobb-Douglas function, using as independent variables, the production inputs, and a dummy variable for the quality of land. The present value of arable land was calculated by capitalizing the net marginal operating margin at interest rates of 3 %, 5 Vo, and 7 % for durations of return of 5, 10, and 15 years. The benefit obtained from supplementary arable land proved highest on cattle farms with a small arable area, while on grain farms the marginal value product and the differential return still remained high as the size of the farm increased. The real price of arable land in the annual purchases of land by the National Board of Agriculture rose very slightly, on an average of 1.7 % per year, during the period 1972—1986. The capitalized value on the cattle farms reached the prices paid for arable land by the National Board of Agriculture, when a duration of return of 15 years and a capitalization rate of 3 % was used. In contrast, the capitalized value of the grain farms did not reach, at any time during the study period, the price level of the National Board of Agriculture. Also, the market prices of arable land, according to the data collected by the National Board of Land Surveying, clearly exceeded the capitalized value of both cattle and grain farms, during the period 1982—1986.",

Correlations and regression equations were calculated between daily digestible crude protein or amino acid intakes and the performance and carcass parameters of the pigs. No connection was found between digestible crude protein intake and the performance of the pigs. The correlations were highest between different lysine intakes and daily gain (DG) (r = 0.808-0.867, p &lt; 0.001). Ileal digestible lysine intake correlated with the performance of the pigs better than did intakes of total or faecal digestible lysine. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) (p &lt; 0.05), and the thickness of back (BF) (p &lt; 0.001) and side fat (SF) (p &lt; 0.001) correlated highly with ileal digestible lysine intake.

The regression equations agreed well with the coefficients of correlation.

The plant compensated the damage of the blossom beetle (Meligethes aenus F.) by producing additional axillary racemes, pods and seeds. The compensation, in plant stands with about 300 plants/m2, reached its maximum capacity with a nitrogen quantity of 90 - 110 kg/hectare and covered about 30% of the harvest loss inflicted by the large blossom beetle population. Only, when the blossom beetle population barely exceeded the control threshold (one beetle per plant at the early bud stage) harvest loss was fully compensated by the extra nitrogen. The damage inflicted by the flea beetles (Phyllolrela spp.) was better compensated, however, the importance of the preventive seed treatment became evident during dry and especially warm emergence periods, when the threshold of 30 holes per plant was exceeded. The use of extra nitrogen, above the moderate 70 - 90 kg/ha, was found to yield 400 kg per hectare at the most, with insecticides the yield increased maximally by more than 1000 kg per hectare. The moderate quantity of nitrogen was, also, sufficient to produce the best operating margin in the cultivation even in heavy mineral soils.",

In the evaluation of the results, other experiments conducted at the Sugar Beet Research Centre have also been referred to. The field trials were conducted on experimental farms of the Sugar Beet Research Centre and of sugar factories. The soil type of the experimental fields varied from compact clay to finesand. The soil pH was high (6.7 —7.4) and the nutrient status good. The fertilizer used was an Na-containing compound fertilizer (N 13 %, P 6 %, K 9 %, Na 6 % in 1982—1987; N 15 %, P 6 %, K 8 %, Na 5 % as from 1988). The fertilizer was applied with a fertilizer drill. A disk bill was used in 1982—1983; thereafter a thin spring tine bill was used. Placement of fertilizer 3—6 cm to the side and 3 cm below the seed increased the root yield of sugar beet by 5—6 %, on an average, as compared to broadcasting. The yield increase ranged from 0 to 24 %. The yield increase from fertilizer placement correlated negatively with the sugar beet yield level. The nutritional status and humus content of soil, and soil type did not affect the yield increase from fertilizer placement. The seed bed preparation one-pass power harrow or conventional method had no significant effect on the yield increase from fertilizer placement. Increasing the level of fertilizer reduced the yield increase from fertilizer placement in some of the trials. This was not always the case, however. Placement usually gave a slightly higher sugar content than did broadcasting. Placement reduced the potassium content of the beet slightly and increased the extractability of sugar. As compared to broadcasting, placement increased the recoverable sugar yield relatively slightly more than the root yield. Placement of the fertilizer 3 cm to the side (3 or 6 cm below the seed) yielded a better result than placement 9 cm to the side of the seed. The depth of placement did not affect the yield. In most trials, placement of the fertilizer reduced the plant population only slightly as compared to broadcasting. The harmful effect in these trials was not significant even with the smallest distance from the seed, i.e. 3 cm. In practice, placement too close was shown to inhibit or to retard germination of the beet. It is therefore recommended that the fertilizer be placed 5—6 cm to the side and 3—4 cm below the seed.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid hybridization is a powerful technique for the diagnosis of many plant viruses not easily detected by serological techniques. It is particularly effective in the detection of viruses occurring in low amount in plant tissue, viruses that are poor immunogens or contain satellites. Molecular probes with desired specificities can be prepared by recombinant DNA techniques for large scale use. cDNA probes of potato virus X(PVX) RNA were made by molecular cloning, and the clones were 32P labelled by nick translation. Hybridization of cDNA to PVX RNA revealed 1 ng of purified virus in 2 µl spots dried onto nitrocellulose filter. Infected samples of crude leaf extracts were easily detected by hybridization, while probes did not react with healthy leaf samples. Nucleic acid hybridization research aims at replacing radiometric probes with nonradioactive methods involving enzymes which are directly or indirectly coupled to the probe and whose presence is observed with the aid of a colour changing substrate. Hybridization assay formats that can easily be automatized are under development. Sandwich hybridization is a simple test format developed for analyzing unpurified biological material, and it appears to be a powerful tool for microbial diagnostics. Sensitivity can be improved by using detection systems in which the specific activity of the probe is increased. Procedures such as ’polymerase chain reaction’, in which the amount of detectable nucleic acid sequences can be increased, are promising alternatives for increasing sensitivity. It is concluded that even if probe-based assays are in their infancy, they will no doubt develop towards such easy use as have immunological test kits.",

    "abstract": "Induced local resistance presumably involves the same mechanisms in the plants as resistance elicited during normal plant-pathogen interactions. In many cases resistance elicitors from pathogens have been found to be non-specific, i.e. unrelated to race-cultivar specificity. Thus, existence of specific resistance suppressors has been suggested to make the virulent races able to infect. In other cases specific resistance elicitors have been indicated to exist in a virulent races, by which the race specific resistance may be accomplished. At our Department resistance has been induced in the barley—powdery mildew interaction by use of double inoculation procedures. Both virulent and avirulent races of barley powdery mildew can induce resistance, but avirulent races show an increased resistance induction ability in relation to virulent races from 12 hours after inoculation. In barley plants wheat powdery mildew induced more resistance than barley powdery mildew 1 to 8 hours after inoculation. Induced resistance was mainly localized to the epidermal cells attacked by the inducer, but an effect was also present in the surrounding epidermal cells. The energetic consequences of resistance in barley to barley powdery mildew have been found to be reflected in an increased respiratory rate at the time of infection attempt. Further, these energy costs appeared to reduce grain yield by 7 %. The expression of resistance in barley is thought to involve de novo synthesis mRNAs and proteins, which makes it possible to apply gene technological methods to study induced resistance. Research of this kind is in progress at our Department, which hopefully will give information on the mechanisms of resistance triggering and resistance expression.",

    "abstract": "The fatty acid composition of the seed oil of summer turnip rape (Brassica campestris L. var. annua) was investigated by gas liquid chromatography (GLC). The reliability of conventional sampling methods in capillary GC was compared with that of the new on column and PTV (programmed temperature vaporizer) techniques, with particular reference to the determination of fatty acid variation. In order to develop new, well-adapted turnip rape strains with improved oil quality, a breeding programme for a higher linoleic acid content, based on individual plant selection, was performed in 1978—85. The results showed that the conventional sampling techniques involving sample transfer to a hot injector were very unreliable as regards precision and accuracy. This was especially the case in the determination of trace fatty acid levels. The PTV methods with splitless and solvent split mode were as precise as cold on-column injection. The PTV sampling modifications, which are all superior to classical techniques, were even more suitable for routine analyses than on-column injection, where several restrictions are met. The analytical error with PTV for most of the compounds represented less than 1 % of the variation found for fatty acids within a turnip rape variety. The breeding experiments indicated that the level of linoleic acid can be increased under open-pollinated conditions in the field without affecting the α-linolenic acid content. The greenhouse conditions, on the other hand, were found to have a considerable environmental influence on the variation of these compounds, resulting in no response to linoleic-acid selection. In field trials, several strains with yields comparable to the varieties commonly cultivated in Finland were selected with a higher linoleic acid content (up to25 %). Most of them also contained no erucic acid. The new evidence concerning its beneficial physiological effects indicate that rapeseed oil should be considered as a serious alternative among sources of essential fatty acids. Such aspects should also be taken into account in future breeding of rapeseed fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "Under prevailing production restrictions the profitability of agricultural production increasingly depends not only on prices of products and inputs, but on how effectively and economically the existing capacity and animal breeds are utilized on farms. The technical efficiency of pork production in Finland is generally high. The average feed conversion rate on farms is only about 16 % lower and daily liveweight gain 20 % less than results from experimental stations. Variation between farms is, however, considerable. The means of technical results between the best and poorest farms differ by 20—30 %. Results also tend to deteriorate and relative deviations increase, especially in large piggeries. The average gross margin percentage was 12 %. Variation in the gross margin per pig was wider between farms than between years. The feed conversion efficiency proved to be the most significant factor contributing to profitability in pork production. Variation in the feed conversion rate accounted for 30 % of total variation in the gross margin. Cost variation was one third larger than the variation of total receipts per pig. The cost of feed varied twice as much as piglet cost. Since the genetic quality of animals in a given region is rather even, variations in productivity depend upon internal factors of piggeries. The large variation in efficiency and profitability over farms emphasizes the human factor i.e. the role of the farmer as the most important factor contributing to successful production.",

According to field experiments, placement of an acid compound fertilizer seems to provide a new possibility of controlling manganese deficiency of sugar beet in heavily limed fields. In 1-year experiments carried out in 1984—1985 in seven fields which showed slight symptoms of manganese deficiency, conversion from top dressing to the placement technique alone increased the availability of soil manganese to sugar beet. The availability was, however, best safeguarded only when manganese (0.7 %) was added to acid compound fertilizer and applied by the placement technique. Placement of manganese (25—30 kg/ha MnSO4; Mn 26 %) together with acid compound fertilizer increased the root yield by 2.0 tons (+ 7%) per hectare in average compared to placement of manganese-free compound fertilizer. The new method of application did not have a significant effect on the quality of sugar beet.",

Leisure provided by relief services in agriculture contributes to well-being, but the leisure-labour choice also influences the revenue. Besides conventional economic and demographic factors, we emphasize the importance of special biological bindings and continuity, as well as risk and uncertainty affecting farmers’ time allocation in agricultural production. We consider structural development as an aggregate factor to explain the demand for farmers’ relief services. In Finland the organisation of the services is more centralized than in the other Nordic countries or the European Union. If government subsidies for relief services were removed and a market mechanism with free price formation adopted, direct government savings would be more than enough to compensate for substantial losses to farmers. Moreover, market forces could produce economic efficiency and local flexibility of a higher degree. State subsidization may still be needed to some extent in changing conditions in order to enable the relief services to develop and serve as a support system of a social, de-coupled, and less distorting nature.",

Theoretical farm models, which assume that compulsory fallowing area might be used for cultivating turnip rapeseed, provide the estimated short term production costs. The necessary government support for producing RME is calculated based on the difference between the production costs of RME against the taxfree wholesale price for diesel oil. In 1990 prices, a producer price of 1.70FIM/kg for turnip rapeseed means production costs of RME are approximately 4.28 FIM/1, or five and a half times higher than the taxfree wholesale price of diesel oil. When the realized producer price in 1990 of 4.12 FIM/kg is used, the RME production costs are 9.98 FIM/1. Thus, there is no economic basis for RME production in Finland.",

The investigated liquid blend contained formic and lactic acids as the major components. These acidifiers were added to grower and finisher diets at levels of 3, 6, and 12 g kg-1 of feed. The grower and finisher diets in the negative control treatment contained no growth promoters, but the grower diet in the positive control treatment was supplemented with avilamycin (40 mg kg-1). The investigated acidifiers did not influence the performance of growing pigs (P &gt; 0.05). In finishing pigs, all additions of the sorbate-coated formic acid improved daily weight gain compared to the negative control (P &lt; 0.05), whereas the feed conversion ratio was improved by additions of 3 and 12 g kg-of the acidifier. During the total fattening period, 6 and g kg-of the sorbate-coated formic acid improved daily weight gain compared to the situation in the negative control (P &lt; 0.05), and g kg-improved the feed conversion ratio (P &lt; 0.05). The addition of 3 g kg-of the blend of formic and lactic acids improved the daily weight gain of the finishing pigs and during the total fattening period, whereas the feed conversion ratio was improved by all the addition levels (P &lt; 0.05). The growth promoting effect of the two acidifiers did not differ significantly, and no significant linear or quadratic trends were found in the pigs performance results between the addition levels from 3 to 12 g kg-1. The sorbcarcass quality of the pigs was not influenced by the acidifiers (P &gt; 0.05). The frequency of severe gastric alterations tended to be smaller when the diets contained 12 g kg-of the sorbate-coated formic acid (P = 0.07), but the results of the other acidifier treatments did not differ significantly from those in the negative control. In conclusion, both the sorbate-coated formic acid and the blend of formic and lactic acids have a growth-promoting effect in fattening pigs already in small dosages, but they do not influence carcass quality or cause gastric alterations.;",

Fat, protein and ash were directly determined and the water content was calculated as difference. By a visual estimate the animals were classified in grade classes using a system in which class I denotes very fat cows and class VII emaciated animals. The average percent composition of the cow femurs was as follows. The ranges of variation are given in brackets. A sick cow is omitted. Fat 33.6 (26.9—38.9), Protein 17.2 (15.0—21.6) Ash 34.8 (30.0—39.9), Water 14.4 (11.3—16.0) There seems to be a negative correlation between the fatness of the cow and the fat content of the femur. However, a closer examination of the results, and especially the examination of the volume-% composition of the femurs, suggests that the accumulation of fat in the bone results from the withdrawal of ash and protein which are the firmness and tenacity giving components in the bone. Probably the cows of the better grade classes have been in better condition not only as regards their fat deposits and musculature but also in regard to the minerals in the bones. Thus a high fat content in the bones is no positive indication of a healthy condition in an animal. The protein content in the femurs of young animals is about the same as that in cow femurs. The water content is high but that of fat and ash low. The femur of a newborn calf was almost fat-free, but the fat and mineral contents seem to increase rapidly already in early life. The investigated tibias contained more protein and ash but less fat than the femurs of the same cows. This study does not afford support to the opinion expressed e.g. by MAYNARD and LOOSLI (1 p. 126) that the fat in the bones the same manner as the adipose tissues in general, serves the animal as energy reserve during scanty feeding. The fat in the bones seems not to decrease when the animal becomes thinner but this probably occurs when the nutritional state pertaining to minerals and vitamins is improved.",

    "abstract": "During the grazing seasons of the years 1961—63 determinations were made on the contents of monosaccharides, sucrose, fructosan, crude protein and ash in various grass species. In 1961 cocksfoot and meadow grass were investigated, in 1962 meadow fescue was included and in 1963 also timothy. Weather observations were also made during the seasons. The following results were established: At the beginning of the grazing season the contents of water-soluble carbohydrates in all the grasses were at a high level, reaching a maximum of slightly over 20 % of the dry matter. This high-sugar level lasted from one to four weeks, depending on the temperature, until the plants began to form flowering heads. At the heading stage the total amount of water-soluble carbohydrates decreased to nearly half of the previous level. During the remainder of the grazing season, or for 3—3 ½ months, the total sugar content was about 8—13 % of the dry matter, dropping sometimes, however, to as low as 6 %. At the end of the dry summer of 1963, higher contents than usual were determined. There were no great differences in the total contents of water-soluble carbohydrates between the different grass species. From the highest to the lowest sugar content, the species were: meadow fescue, meadow grass, cocksfoot. In fact timothy should be ranged as the first but this grass was not sampled from the pasture paddocks. Of the various water-soluble carbohydrates, the sucrose fraction was the largest in most of the samples. Cocksfoot contained less fructosan than the other grasses, and at the heading stage its content of monosaccharides was very high. Of the three years of the study, two were rainy and one was dry. In spite of the differing weather conditions, however, no noteworthy differences in the water-soluble carbohydrate contents were observed. The crude protein content was found to be dependent upon the growth stage. No appreciable differences were observed between cocksfoot, meadow grass and meadow fescue. Timothy, on the other hand, had a lower content of both protein and ash than the three pasture grasses. Contents of cell-wall substances were generally alike during the pasture season. Notable exceptions were evident only in the cases where the samples represented grass at an early growth stage. Meadow grass contained slightly more cell-wall constituents than cocksfoot, e. g. its xylan and crude lignin contents were somewhat higher. Furthermore, the solubility of such constituents in weak acid was slightly less for meadow grass than for cocksfoot.",

Two working fluids were used: foliar fertilizer Mikrovit Copper 80 and a nanocopper preparation, at the dose of 160 g Cu ha-1. The deposition treatment of the plants was conducted in the spraying chamber ‘Aporo1’ at two pressures (0.20 and 0.28 MPa), using two different types of flat fan nozzles. The dried rape plants were mineralized, and then, in order to determine the deposit, the Cu element concentration was measured using the spectrometer. The largest deposit of copper was obtained using the foliar fertilizer Mikrovit Copper 80 and using a double flat fan nozzle DF 120-02.

    "abstract": "Käsillä olevassa tutkimuksessa on pyritty selvittämään maatalousrakennusten määrää ja arvoa sekä eräiden rakennusten kapasiteetin hyväksikäyttöä tutkituilla viljelmillä. Tutkimusaineisto on kerätty viiden Joensuun kaupungin etelä- ja länsipuolella olevan kunnan alueelta. Tutkimuksen kohteena ovat olleet kaikki ne (129) viljelmät, jotka näiden kuntien alueella joutuivat luovuttamaan peltoa uusien valtamaanteiden rakentamiseen vuosina 1956—1961. Taulukoissa 1 ja 2 on esitetty maankäyttölajien jakaantuminen ja viljelmien keskimääräinen koko tutkimusalueella. Eri rakennusten keskimääräinen pinta-ala ja tilavuus on esitetty taulukossa 3 ja 4. Asuinrakennusten ala henkilöä kohti oli alle 10 ha:n viljelmillä 17.6 m2, 10.00– 24.99 ha:n viljelmillä 21.3 m2 ja 25.00–49.99 ha:n viljelmillä 28.5 m2. Tutkittujen viljelmien kotieläinrakennusten ala peltohehtaaria kohti lisääntyy aluksi peltoalan kasvaessa (kuvio 1). Maksimin rakennusten määrä hehtaaria kohti saavuttaa noin 8 peltohehtaarin viljelmillä. Tämän jälkeen rakennusten määrä supistuu peltoalan edelleen lisääntyessä. Kun kotieläinten määrä peltohehtaaria kohti viljelmän pienentyessä lisääntyy (kuvio 2), jää pienillä viljelmillä rakennusalaa eläintä kohti vähiten. Kuviossa 3 on esitetty kotieläinrakennusten ala peltohehtaaria kohti kumulatiivisena frekvenssikäyränä. Kuviosta voidaan havaita tutkimusaineistossa tarkasteltavaan omaisuuteen nähden vallitseva suuri hajonta. Hajontaa on tarkasteltu yksityiskohtaisemmin taulukossa 5. Korsirehuvarastoja oli tutkituilla viljelmillä keskimäärin runsaasti (taulukko 3 ja 4). Mitä suurempi varastojen luku oli sitä enemmän viljelmillä oli varastotilaa hehtaaria kohti. Kuviossa 4 on esitetty korsirehuvarastojen määrä viljelmäsuuruusluokittain kumulatiivisenä frekvenssikäyränä. Eri rakennusten tai rakennusryhmien keski-ikä oli verraten alhainen (taulukko 6). Ensimmäisen suuruusluokan viljelmien rakennukset olivat keskimäärin nuorimpia. Rakennusten keski-ikä lisääntyi viljelmän peltoalan kasvaessa. Asuin- ja varastorakennukset olivat lähes yksinomaan puisia (taulukko 7), mutta kotieläinrakennuksista oli huomattava osa kivirakenteisia. Rakennusten arvo on laskettu viljelmäsuuruusluokittain sekä koko viljelmää että yhtä peltohehtaaria kohti (taulukot 8–11). Talousrakennusten arvo peltohehtaaria kohti peltoalan funktiona on esitetty kuviossa 5. Talousrakennusten arvo hehtaaria kohti aluksi lisääntyy peltoalan lisääntyessä. Se saavuttaa maksimin noin 7 peltohehtaarin viljelmillä ja alenee tämän jälkeen lähes lineaarisesti peltoalan kasvaessa. Rakennusten keskimääräinen nykyarvo oli tutkimusvuonna 62.0 % jälleenhankinta-arvosta. Lämmintä kotieläinrakennusalaa oli alle 10.00 peltohehtaarin viljelmillä keskimäärin 12.2 m2/ny, 10.00–24,99 hehtaarin viljelmillä 11.7 m2/ny ja 25.00– 49.99 hehtaarin viljelmillä 14.1 m2/ny. Tutkittujen viljelmien kotieläinrakennusten kapasiteetin hyväksikäyttö tutkimusvuonna on esitetty taulukossa 12 ja kuviossa 6. Kapasiteetin hyväksikäyttö on vaihdellut suuresti. Kaikista viljelmistä 30.2 % käytti tutkimushetkellä hyväksi 90 % tai enemmän kotieläinrakennusten lasketusta maksimikapasiteetista. Näillä viljelmillä on käytetty kotieläinrakennusalaa 6.5 m2/ny, ilman karjakeittiötä ja maitohuonetta ja 8.0 m2/ny karjakeittiön ja maitohuoneen ala mukaan luettuna. Eri ikäisten kotieläinrakennusten kapasiteetin hyväksikäyttö on esitetty taulukossa 13. Kotieläinrakennusten kapasiteetin heikko hyväksikäyttö johtunee huomattavalta osalta siitä, että viimeisen kahden vuosikymmenen kuluessa kotieläinten luku peltohehtaaria kohti on supistunut lähes 30 %. Niissä tapauksissa, joissa maatila oli jaettu sisarusten kesken, kantatilan talousrakennusten kapasiteetin hyväksikäyttö oli yleensä alhainen. Korsirehuvarastojen kapasiteetin hyväksikäyttö käy ilmi taulukosta 14. Eräillä viljelmillä on ollut liian vähän korsirehuvarastoja. Näillä kapasiteetin hyväksikäyttöluku ei suinkaan kuvaa todellista käyttöä, vaan osoittaa, ettei varastoja ole ollut riittävästi. Useilla viljelmillä korsirehuvarastojen luku on ollut huomattavan suuri. Kuviossa 7 on esitetty varastojen luvun ja kapasiteetin välinen riippuvuus. Niillä viljelmillä, joilla viljelyn voimaperäisyys on ollut heikko, myös korsirehuvarastojen kapasiteetin hyväksikäyttö näyttää olleen heikompi kuin voimaperäisesti viljellyillä viljelmillä.",

Perus- ja vuotuislannoituksen monipuolisuus on monien hyväksymä, mutta lannoitteiden käyttömäärät ovat pienet ja väärin tasapainoitetut. Tähän lienee eräänä syynä pyrkimys pieniin perustamis- ja hoitokustannuksiin. Voimakkaan lannoituksen seuraus on paitsi suurempi lannoitekustannus myös suurentunut niittokustannus.

It is noted that in the course of time the soil may become increasingly inhomogeneous, e.g. owing to sludge brought in by inundations, and owing to the wear of the peat on cultivated peat land. An initial shaping of the soil surface is essential in the case of cultivated peat lands because non-uniform settling of the soil may occur in the course of time in the test area. The soil surface of the different test members may also settle in different degrees, depending on the treatment involved in the test. Because of soil transportation from one test plot to another, caused by the tilling operations, the location and shape of the test plots are of significance in long-term tests intended to clarify questions associated with soil characteristics.",

However, very little empirical material dealing with the substance of the matter seems to exist, for which reason the issue has been dealt with somewhat peripherally. Certain conclusions may, nevertheless, be drawn. The significance of managerial skill in the reorganization of production and re-allocation of resources will continuously increase in importance in the future for the following reasons, which are all inter-related: Science and techniques are with increasing speed achieving technical improvements in methods, the sufficiently rapid adoption of which requires increasing alertness to enable the farmer to keep up with the times. It is not possible to create a rationally managed farm unit without resorting to new technical achievements, so the farmers of these farms are allowed to attain an income level deemed moderate by the government in its official agricultural policy. The size of the farms, expressed according to area, or man work units or in some other way, tends to increase, which also involves a closer dependence on credit granting. Farms are becoming increasingly commercial which requires a business training. It is obvious that the advantage of ability is considerably greater in those undertakings in which more capital is invested, taking into consideration the continuing growth of the part played by capital in the business. In order that the realization of the re-organization would keep pace with the technical development, sufficient attention should be given to 1) the attaining of up-to-date professional training 2) a sufficiently rapid succession of generations in the farming.",

Kultakin lohkolta on tehty 2.—14.7.1961 välisenä aikana kevätviljasta neljä 0.25 m2:n suuruista näytealakuvausta eli yhteensä 196 näytealakuvausta. Näiden kevätviljalohkojen sisäisten sarkaojien pientareista on tehty sama määrä näytealakuvauksia. Näytealakuvauksia tehtäessä putkilokasvit on pyritty määrittämään lajilleen ja kunkin lajin peittävyys on arvioitu prosentteina. Pelloissa on todettu turvemaalla esiintyviksi 7, turvesavimaalla 2 ja savimaalla 21 lajia (taulukko 1). Pientareissa on todettu turvemaalla esiintyviksi 9, turvesavimaalla 6 ja savimaalla 19 lajia (taulukko 2). Esikasvi vaikuttaa kevätviljavaiheen kasvien yleisyyteen. Pelloissa on todettu kevätviljan jälkeen 7 lajin tai suvun olevan yleisemmän kuin nurmen jälkeen. Nurmen jälkeen on vastaavasti todettu 8 lajin olevan yleisemmän kuin kevätviljan jälkeen (taulukko 3). Kevätviljan jälkeen yleiset lajit ovat etupäässä yksivuotisia ja nurmen jälkeen yleiset monivuotisia. Pientareissa on todettu neljän lajin tai suvun olevan yleisemmän kevätviljan kuin nurmen jälkeen ja kuuden lajin yleisemmän nurmen kuin kevätviljan jälkeen (taulukko 4). Edellisistä lajeista kolme on yksivuotista ja yksi monivuotinen. Jälkimmäiset lajit ovat kaikki monivuotisia. Poa pratensis, Phleum pratense ja Trifolium pratense esiintyvät pientareissa etupäässä savimaalla, pelloissa turvemaalla. Pelloissa niitä viljellään etenkin turvemailla, tai niiden siemeniä joutuu sinne. Kyseessä olevat lajit eivät kuitenkaan kykene piennarkasvustoissa menestymään turvemaalla niin hyvin kuin savimaalla. Peltojen kasvillisuudesta on kuvattu kaksi kasvustoa, joista toinen esiintyy turve- ja toinen savimaalla. Samaan kasvustoon on luettu kaikki viljelykierrossa eri vuosina erotettavat osakasvustot, joita kutsutaan vuosiosakasvustoiksi. Kevätviljavaiheen vuosiosakasvustoja kuvataan taulukon 5 sarakkeissa 1 ja 3. Pientareiden kasvillisuudesta on myös kuvattu kaksi kasvustoa (taulukko 5, sarakkeet 9 ja 11), joista toinen esiintyy turve-, toinen savimaalla. Pelloissa on todettu 196 näytealalla yhteensä 78 ja pientareissa vastaavasti 112 lajia. Pientareiden lajeista on suhteellisesti suurempi osa kuin peltojen lajeista pienimmässä yleisyysluokassa. Lohkojen pelloissa ja pientareissa 1 m2:llä todetut lajimäärät ovat positiivisessa korrelaatiossa toisiinsa. 64 lajin on todettu esiintyvän sekä pelloissa että pientareissa. Näistä lajeista 52 on esiintynyt samalla lohkolla sekä pellossa että pientareissa. Näiden lajien yhtäläisyysverranteet ovat 0.3—50.0. Kevätviljapeltojen ja niiden sarkaojien pientareiden kasvustot ovat melko erilaisia. Suurimmat yhtäläisyydet ovat eräillä monivuotisilla piennarlajeilla.",

Ohranäytteitä idätettiin laboratoriossa joko normaalisesti tai kahteen kertaan, jolloin mahdollisesti esiintyneet juuri-idut välillä poistettiin. Normaalin idätyksen aikana amylolyyttisten entsyymien aktiivisuus lisääntyi hyvälaatuisessa ohrassa jyrkemmin kuin huonolaatuisessa ohraseoksessa. Viimeksi mainitun α-amylaasiaktiivisuus oli jo ennen idätystä n. 3 diastaattista yksikköä; vastaavan aktiivisuuden hyvälaatuinen ohra saavutti vasta 2 vrk:n idätyksen jälkeen.

Amylografitutkimuksissa amylolyyttisten entsyymien aiheuttama tärkkelyksen pilkkoutuminen tuli havaittavaksi n. 12 t liotuksen jälkeen. Idättämättömässä huonolaatuisessa ohraseoksessa todettiin paperikromatografisesti maltoosia enemmän kuin hyvälaatuisessa ohrassa. Maltoosin määrässä todettiin huomattava lisääntyminen 3 vrk:n ja glukoosin määrässä 4 vrk:n idätyksen jälkeen. Hyvälaatuisen idättämättömän ohran proteolyyttinen aktiivisuus oli vajaa puolet huonolaatuisen ohraseoksen aktiivisuudesta, ja idätyksen aikana molempien ohranäytteiden aktiivisuus lisääntyi jokseenkin samalla nopeudella. Vapaiden aminohappojen määrä lisääntyi idätyksen aikana suhteessa proteolyyttisen aktiivisuuden kasvuun. Molempien ohranäytteiden amylolyyttisten ja proteolyyttisten entsyymien aktiivisuudessa todettiin itämisen alussa liotuksen aikana alenemista; amylografinen tutkimus vahvisti amylolyyttisten entsyymien aktiivisuuden alenemisen. Kaksoisidätyskokeissa huonolaatuisen ohraseoken diastaattisen aktiivisuuden todettiin lisääntyneen toisella idätyskerralla jyrkemmin kuin ensimmäisellä ja molemmilla kerroilla nopeammin kuin hyvälaatuisen ohran. Aktiivisuuden lisääntyminen toisessa idätyksessä oli sitä voimakkaampaa mitä lyhyempää idätystä ensimmäisessä vaiheessa oli käytetty. Molempien näytteiden amylolyyttisten entsyymien aktiivisuudet olivat toisessa idätyksessä 3 vrk:n kuluttua noin kaksinkertaiset ensimmäiseen idätykseen verrattuna. Hyvälaatuisen ohran proteolyyttisen aktiivisuuden kasvu oli toisella idätyskerralla erityisen nopeaa huonolaatuiseen ohraseokseen verrattuna. Epäedullisissa kosteusoloissa alkuunpäässeellä entsyymitoiminnalla on selvästi todettava vaikutus ulkonaisesti moitteettoman ohranjyvän koostumukseen.",

    "abstract": "Since 1975, European policy has provided some kind of support to areas with specific handicaps for agricultural production, in an attempt to maintain farming activities and population levels in them. The definition of clear criteria for the selection of the so called “Less Favoured Areas” (LFAs) is challenging because of the variability of regions within Europe and the variability of farm characteristics within each region. Actual selection remains very much a deductive approach and empirical evidence is scarce. This study investigates the relationship between the criteria of specific natural handicaps used for the delineation of intermediate LFAs (2014–2020) in Lithuania and generic farming condition and status. Results confirm the negative effects of selected natural handicaps on farm economic status and productive land use but raise some concerns regarding the idoneity of some of them, opening a way for their improvement.",

All cows were fed concentrates in the CUDP (30% of ME d-1). Plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were lower and insulin tended to be higher in HEI vs. CON prepartum. No dietary effects in accretion or mobilization of body reserves were observed, and accordingly no differences in silage DMI, ME balance and plasma parameters postpartum were detected.

Weight loss and cooking loss were smaller, and drip loss was greater after frozen storage compared with refrigerated storage. The pH of stored meat was typical of high-quality beef. TBARS values increased after refrigerated storage and after frozen storage. The changes in color parameters point to metmyoglobin formation in frozen meat. Both refrigerator and freezer storage had beneficial influence on tenderness, and shear force values decreased in frozen beef. The composition of MA during refrigerated storage had no effect on the analyzed parameters of beef. Frozen meat that was stored in a MA containing Ar prior to freezing was characterized by the lowest weight loss, and vacuum-packaged meat - by the lowest TBARS values.",

    "abstract": "A successive alkalinity producing system (SAPS) has been investigated as a potential passive treatment option for acid, metal containing runoff from acid sulphate soil. A pilot-scale system was installed at an agricultural land site in Rintala embankment area in mid-western Finland. The experimental layout consists of three parallel treatment units: two different SAPS cells and one limestone-filled cell for comparison of performance. The SAPS cells are composed of a bottom layer of limestone and a top layer of compost supplemented with sand. One of the SAPS cells contains sulphate-rich, waste gypsum mixed with the compost layer in order to enhance the metal reduction by sulphate reducing-bacteria. Over a 3 year period on average between 612 l min-1 of water from a nearby drain receiving acid drainage was directed to the system. The quality of the influent water was highly variable: pH 4.17.1, aluminium 0.06129 mg l-1, iron 0.04622 mg l-1, manganese 1.923 mg l-1. Flow through the cells increased the pH and decreased the acidity and concentrations of Al and Fe. Manganese concentrations did not change significantly (P &lt; 0.05, paired t-test) in any of the treatment cells. The current results do not demonstrate the advantages of a SAPS system when compared to a limestone bed and the present implementation is not considered to be an effective treatment method for acid drainage water. Therefore, to increase the alkalinity production of SAPS cells, the system will be modified to increase the contact time of water with limestone.;",

    "abstract": "Professor Onni Pohjakallio, an eminent Finnish agricultural scientist, was born in Viborg in 1903. In 1929 he obtained his Master’s degree in Agriculture and Forestry and in 1934 his Doctor’s degree in this same field. In the years 1931—34 he was inspector for the state local plant husbandry trials, in 1934—45 he served as chief assistant in the Department of Plant Breeding of the Agricultural Experimental Institute, and in 1945 he was appointed professor of plant biology and pathology at the University of Helsinki. In his position as professor, Pohjakallio had a profound influence in developing the instructional and experimental programme of the Department of Plant Pathology. One of his most important accomplishments was the acquisition of the Muddusniemi Experimental Farm in Lapland (69° 05' N), where long-term field trials threw new light on the behaviour of crops in the northern regions of Finland. Another of his notable achievements was the publication of a comprehensive two-volume text-book on plant pathology. Pohjakallio’s scientific activity was extremely wide and diversifield, and he published a great number of papers dealing with fertilisation, plant husbandry, breeding, physiology, ecology and pathology. The subject of his doctoral dissertation published in 1932 was the significance of sugar as a food source of certain rust fungi. During his years as inspector of local trials he published a series of papers on fertilisation. At the Department of Plant Breeding his main subjects were clover, oats and herbage crops. In his breeding of oats he succeeded in improving the resistance of this crop to Ustilago smut. Many of Pohjakallio’s studies cleared up problems dealing with the overwintering of crops. In these studies he drew attention to the important antibiotic effect of fungi, bacteria and other microorganisms on plant pathogens, particularly on Sclerotinia trifoliorum. He also conducted extensive investigations on total whiteheads of grasses, which he believed to be due to acute starvation in the meristematic tissues of the stems. Numerous papers on the lack of energy in plant tissues and their death by starvation were published by Pohjakallio. One of the most noteworthy of Pohjakallio’s research fields pertained to the effect of phoroperiodism and day-length on plant growth in northern and southern Finland. He showed that the earlier view about the exceedingly rapid plant growth under the constant summer illumination in Lapland were too optimistic, erroneously based on the results from certain especially favourable years and on the fact that in Lapland only the most early-maturing varieties are cultivated. Pohjakallio also was an active participant in international agricultural conferences where he often delivered papers. Professor Pohjakallio had a profound influence on agricultural research in this country. Not only did he accomplish much in his own studies, but he also opened new vistas and provided stimulus for further work in many fields of agricultural science.",

The cows were divided into two groups, I comprising 19 cows with 1 or 2 calvings and II 19 cows with more than 2 calvings. The blood hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (Hc) values, and the amounts of calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphorus (P), and magnesium (Mg) in serum were determined and coefficients of correlation between the blood components and the level of the daily milk yield were calculated. The following significant partial correlations were obtained: in group I, for Hb with Mg (0.29*) and milk yield (—0.28*), and for Ca with milk yield (0.54***); in group II, for Hb with milk yield (—0.42***), and for Mg with P (0.25*); in groups I + II, for Hb with milk yield (—0.31***). The significance of the simple and corresponding partial correlations was very similar, and it did not make much difference whether the absolute instead of the relative daily milk yield was used as a variable in the calculations. The results are discussed in detail.",

It was found, however, that iodine deficiency: a) delayed significantly the conception of the second generation females (C2) (Table 3) but was quite ineffective in the first generation females (B1, C1) (Tables 2 &amp; 4), b) did not significantly affect the number of pups dropped or their birth weight, c) increased pup mortality during suckling period, d) tended to decrease the weight of the female sex organs of adult rats (Table 5), e) increased the absolute thyroid weight more rapidly in young growing rats than in old fullgrown rats (Tables 3, 4 &amp; 5), and more rapidly in growing males than females, f) decreased significantly and progressively the PBI level in the serum of adult females which had pregnancies and lactations, g) obviously adversely affected the milk secretion of C1 rats during their second lactation on iodine deficient diet (Experiment II) as judged from the growth rate of their pups during 0—15 days after birth, h) did not adversely affect the growth rate of the suckling offspring of the dams during their first lactation on iodine deficient diet (Tables 3 &amp; 4), i) did not significantly affect the rate of gain of the young rats from weaning up to 60-days of age. The rats transferred from iodine deficient to commercial diet at weaning had larger body weights and smaller thyroids at the age of 60 days than their litter mates remaining on an iodine deficient diet (Table 4). There is of course a possibility that the commercial diet was more palatable than the semisynthetic diet. It is also possible that the iodine deficiency activated the thyroid during the preweaning period and that after the transfer to iodine containing commercial diet at weaning, more thyroxine was secreted from preactivated glands compared to thyroids of the controls or thyroids of the rats kept on an iodine deficident diet throughout the growth period. Thyroid hormones are required for normal growth. A hypothyroid condition favours the accumulation of water and fat into the body tissues and may by this way result in an increase of the body weight. ln this study, however, no attempt was made to estimate the fat content of the body of the experimental rats.",

Measurements of the rate of decrease of blood ethanol concentration, which is affected in part by elimination of ethanol in urine, milk and exhaled air, gave an apparent rate of oxidation in the animal organism (mean value for 4 cows) of 1.39 (range 0.75—1.59) kg per 500 kg live weight per 24 hr. During a 7-day experiment the cows’ drinking water contained about 1.4 % (w/v) ethanol. Their health did not appear to be affected adversely and blood glucose levels measured on the 7th day were normal. Milk yields decreased slightly at the beginning of the ethanol administration but then rose again during a period of a few days to pre-experiment levels. Drinking water containing 2 % ethanol caused clear intoxication in the cow which drank most (animal fell over). Administration of ethanol in the drinking water gave rise to a distinct off-flavour in the milk.",

Kaliumnitraattilannoituksella ei ollut vaikutusta satotulokseen eikä ruotien värittymiseen. Varren kasvua lannoitus vähensi silloin, kun sitä annettiin multapaakun suojaamille kasveille. Ruotien väritys oli parempi hyödettäessä 10° C:n lämpötilassa kuin 15° C:n lämpötilassa. Vuonna 1965 järjestetyssä ruotien varastointikokeessa todettiin ruotien säilyvän PV-muovipusseissa neljä viikkoa kauppakelpoisina.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study has been to elucidate the relationship between various factors and household consumption expenditure. The data, collected by households, are from the rural consumption investigation carried out in 1959/60. The data were studied in two separate groups, farming households and wage-earner households. The research unit was a household. The seven different expenditure groups (tables 1 and 2) were studied in detail and the variations in their share of the total expenditure were studied by stepwise regression analysis. The equations developed for studying the monetary consumption expenditure are given in tables 3 and 4. It is notable that the third degree function of the expenditure class rise gave the best explanation for the variations in some expense groups for all these households. Of the variations in the other expenditure group for the wage earners, almost a half were determined by the parabolic function of the increase in expenditure alone. In explaining the variations in the different expenditure groups, the models given in tables 3 and 4 proved somewhat more efficient than the original models (tables 1 and 2). It must be kept in mind, however, that the data on many of the expenditure groups were rather limited in both an absolute and a relative sense. Regularities that would explain the expenditure variations were not provided by the independent variables for all relationships. It should also be kept in mind that the results are based on data from each household for consumption expenditure for a period of one month. The available data also imposed certain restrictions on the variables tested for their relationships with the consumption expenditure.",

Tutkimuksessa todettiin seuraavaa: Jauhojen kypsyysasteen ja tärkkelysjyvästen mekaanisesti tapahtuneen särkymisasteen arvosteluperustana amyloglukosidaasimenetelmä on polarisaatio- ja kongopunamenetelmiä parempi. Entsyymimenetelmä sopii kvantitatiiviseen määrittämiseen, mikroskooppimenetelmät vain summittaiseen arvioimiseen. Amyloglukosidaasi hydrolysoi puhtaasta viljantärkkelyksestä ilman liisteröimiskeittoa vain 11—13 %, herneen- ja perunantärkkelyksestä vielä vähemmän. Liisteröiminen saa aikaan täydellisen hydrolyysin. Myös jyvästen mekaaninen särkeminen lisää pienessä määrin niiden etsyymiherkkyyttä. Mahalaukun olosuhteita jäljittelevä pepsiini-suolahappo käsittely ei muuta vehnäneikä perunantärkkelystä amyloglukosidaasille herkemmäksi. Jo noin 20 %:n vedenlisäys ja kuumentaminen autoklaavissa 120°:ssa saa aikaan vehnä-, ohra- ja kaurajauhossa tärkkelyksen lähes täydellisen herkistymisen entsyymille, vaikka näin pieni vesimäärä ei aiheuta havaittavaa paisumista tärkkelysjyväsissä. Ylipäänsä kypsytysmenetelmä on järjestettävä sellaiseksi, että käsiteltävä erä kokonaisuudessaan kuumenee liisteröimislämpötilaan ja samalla siinä säilyy tietty vesipitoisuus. Sekä kuivauskaapissa että autoklaavissa 1 ilmakehän ylipaineessa jauhona kypsytetty, kuivattu ja jauhettu vilja menettää varastoitaessa entsyymiherkkyyttään. 4 kk:n varastointi alensi sitä noin 25 %:Ila.

The properties studied consisted of the aroma number, the organoleptic evaluation, and the degree of ripeness. As regards aroma number, great variations were noted between the samples. The influence of variety was rather slight. In general, the aroma numbers were higher when the summer was cool and the growing locality more to the north, probably by reason of the losses of volatile reducing substances at higher temperatures. The utility of the aroma number in characterization of quality seems limited in scope. Smell and taste were taken as the main criteria in the organoleptic evaluation. The differences between the varieties were not very great, but in any event a relatively consistent sequence was discovered. Consideration is given to some factors which influence organoleptic properties. The degree of ripeness of the samples, and the effect of this factor on the quality properties, were studied. The degree of ripeness displays a correlation with the corresponding effective temperature totals. Here, the effect of the ripeness factor on the results was only slight, as unripe berries were removed from the samples before analysis. However, some effect may have remained, to some degree influencing the colour strength, but the organoleptic properties to a lesser degree.",

Lisävalona annetun ultraviolettivalon vaikutusta verrattiin auringonvalossa sekä keinovalossa kasvatuskaapeissa. Tutkimuksen tarkoituksena oli selvittää, oliko ultraviolettivalolla mahdollisesti osuutta kasvunsääteiden vuodenaikojenmukaisissa tehon vaihteluissa. Kokeet osoittivat, että UV-valo lisäsi käsittelemättömien ja Cycocelilla käsiteltyjen kasvien pituuskasvua, mutta selvästi vähemmän Phosfonilla käsiteltyjen kasvien. Kokeen tulosten sekä kirjallisuudessa esitettyjen tietojen perusteella voitiin otaksua, ettei kyseinen pituuskasvun lisääntyminen kokonaisuudessaan aiheutunut UV-lisävalon yhteyttämistä lisäävästä eikä lisäsäteilyn lehden lämpötilaa kohottavasta vaikutuksesta, vaan siihen oli todennäköisimmin syynä myös UV-valon vaikutus pituuskasvua sääteleviin kasvuaineisiin. Kokeen tulosten perusteella on otaksuttavissa että UV-valon suurempi määrä kesällä on ainakin osittain syynä siihen, että Cycocelin teho näennäisesti tällöin on vähäisempi kuin talvella. Ultravioletilla valolla ei ollut fotoperodista vaikutusta, eikä sen todettu vahingoittavan kasveja. Phosfon hillitsi krysanteemin pituuskasvua enemmän kuin Cycocel. Cycocelin vaikutus ’Bonnaffon de Lux’-lajikkeeseen oli suurempi kuin ’Golden Princess Anne’-lajikkeeseen pituuskasvun lyhenemisen mukaan arvosteltaessa. Phosfonin kohdalla tilanne oli päinvastainen.

    "abstract": "Kausi 1950-luvun alusta nykypäiviin on ollut maataloudessamme voimakasta uusien linjojen etsinnän aikaa. Se on ollut samalla teollisen yhteiskunnan esiinmarssia, mikä on pakottanut maatalouden määrittämään omat mahdollisuutensa myös tulevaisuudessa. Tälle jaksolle on ollut oleellista voimakas koneistuminen, maatalousväestön määrän väheneminen, pyrkimys voimaperäisempään viljelyyn, karjataloustuotteiden lähinnä maidon ylituotanto, tuotannon hintapoliittinen ohjaus, myös alueelliset näkökohdat huomioon ottaen sekä pyrkimys neuvonnan, viime vuosina varsinkin taloudellisen ja maatilatalouden kokonaisuutena näkevän neuvonnan, voimakkaaseen korostamiseen. Koneellistaminen on maatiloillamme tapahtuneen kehityksen olennaisimpia piirteitä. Vetovoimassa on tapahtunut muutoksia siten, että traktorien määrä on lisääntynyt kahdeksankertaiseksi ja yhden uuden traktorin käyttöönotto on korvannut n. 1.3 hevosta. Maatalouden juoksevaa traktorityötä oli v. 62/63 hehtaaria kohti 20 t. ja hevostyötä 23 t. Keskim. käyttömäärä traktoria kohti oli 521 t. Tällä hetkellä on maataloudessa toimivaa traktoria kohti peltoa 22 ha ja leikkuupuimuria kohti 180 ha. Sotien seurauksena menetettiin n. 1/10 maamme peltoalasta, mutta voimakkaan asutustoiminnan seurauksena uutta on raivattu niin, että sodan edellinen pinta-ala on saavutettu. Yli 2 ha:n tilojen määrä on 1950 luvusta lähtien lisääntynyt n. 10 %:lla, keskipinta-ala pysynyt likimain samana, 8,9 ha, alueellisia eroavuuksia on kuitenkin runsaasti. Ihmistyön käytössä on tapahtunut 1950-luvulla suuria muutoksia varsinkin palkkaväen ja avustavien perheenjäsenten kohdalla. Palkkaväen suorittamien työpäivien määrä putosi yli 50 %, koko työpanoksen pienenemisen ollessa 18.8 %. 1960-luvulla jatkuu työpanoksen pieneneminen n. 1.6 %:n vuosivauhtia. Eniten on vähentymistä tapahtunut ikäluokassa 17–34. Pellon käytössä ei ole tapahtunut suurempia muutoksia, viljan osuus on jonkin verran lisääntynyt, rukiin määrässä on kuitenkin tapahtunut vähentymistä. Lannoitteiden käyttö on lisääntynyt 1950-luvun alusta n. 3-kertaiseksi, ja viljelysmenetelmät ovat parantuneet. Satotasossa ei kuitenkaan ole tapahtunut odotettua parannusta. Osasyynä tähän ovat olleet 1950-luvun lopun ja 1960-luvun alun keskimääräistä huonommat sääsuhteet, 1950-luvulla on satotaso kohonnut, mutta vasta nyt on saavutettu vuosien 1938—39 taso. Kotieläintuotossa on tapahtunut huomattavaa nousua. Maidontuotos on kohonnut ennen sotia vallinneesta tasosta n, 60 % ja v. 1950 lähtien n. 35 %. Rationalisointitoiminnan ja yleensä tuotantomenetelmien kehittäminen on kuitenkin oloissamme kotieläintaloudessa erittäin vaikeaa johtuen pienestä tilakoosta ja pienistä karjayksiköistä. V. 1959 oli yli 10 lehmää käsittävien karjojen osuus koko karjatilamääristämme ainoastaan 2.7 %, yleisimmän karjakoon ollessa 3–4 lehmää. Maatalouden tuotto on noussut v. 1951/52 lähtien käytettäessä kiinteitä hintoja n. 38 %, kustannukset n. 51 %. Suhteellisesti eniten ovat kohonneet nestemäisten polttoaineiden, väkilannoitteiden ja kaluston hinnat, kun taas palkkamenot ovat pienentyneet, vaikka palkkataso on kohonnut, palkkaväen määrän pienentymisen johdosta.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper the effect of irrigation on the ripening and on the quality of grain yield in the dry summers 1964—1966 was studied. Both the ripening and the quality of grain were found to be highly dependent on the date of irrigation. There was a distinct transitional period, before which irrigation speeded up ripening, decreased the amount of green grains and improved hectoliter weights and »falling numbers». On the contrary, if irrigation was applied after this transitional period, ripening was retarded and the quality of grains was impaired in regard to these properties. This transitional period was in the experimental years about two weeks before ear emergence or about Midsummer. The optimum period of irrigation, in regard to both yield level and to its ripening and quality, was in the middle between sprouting and ear emergence and its length was about two weeks. Wheat, barley and oats all responded to the date of irrigation in about the same way. The placement of fertilizers into the depth of 8—12 cm speeded up ripening and improved hectoliter weights. Particularly, it decreased the unfavourable effect of too late irrigation. The rate of fertilizers had no great influence on the quality of grains. Irrigation did not increase the weight of grains, but it increased the number of grains. The main effect of irrigation was likely to be caused by the tillering of crops, and these adventitious shoots had time to ripen, if irrigation was applied at a sufficiently early stage of development. The crude protein content of both wheat, barley and oats was markedly decreased by irrigation independently of the date of it. This decrease was usually the greater the higher yield was obtained. The decrease in the crude protein content indicates a shortage of nitrogen which was likely to be caused by the scanty mobilizeable resources of nitrogen in the soils long cultivated without leys. Obviously, this unfavourable decrease in the crude protein content could have been prevented with heavy dressings of fertilizer nitrogen.",

Arvosteluperustana oli amyloglukosidaasimenetelmä, mutta myös kongopunavärjäystä ja polarisaatiota kokeiltiin. Tutkimuksessa todettiin seuraavaa: Yhden tehtaan (C) tutkitut kaksi rehuerää olivat erittäin hyvin kypsytettyjä, ts. 95—97 % tärkkelyksestä oli helposti fermentoituvaa. Vain nämä rehut olivat hiutaleina. Toisen tehtaan (A) yksi rehu, josta tutkittiin kolme eri näytettä, oli tuoreena jokseenkin edellisen veroista (92—95 %). Saman tehtaan kaksi muuta rehua olivat tutkituista näyte-eristä heikoimpia (n. 38 %). Kahden muun tehtaan (B ja D) rehut olivat tältä väliltä. Tehtaan C rehujen fermentoitumisherkkyys ei varastoitaessa alentunut ja tehtaan A parhaalla rehulla se aleni vain melko vähän (n. 80 %:iin). Kaikki muut rehut sen sijaan tässä mielessä »vanhenivat» ja yleensä sitä enemmän, mitä heikompi kypsytys alunperin oli ollut. Huhmarointi tai jauhatus analyysimyllyllä paransi tärkkelyksen fermentoitumisherkkyyttä heikostikin kypsytetyssä rehussa enemmän kuin raa’assa jauhossa. Eri tehtaiden rehuissa todetut erot ilmeisesti johtuivat joko kypsytysprosessin tai jauhatuksen eroavuuksista, tai molemmista.

Neljästä rehusta tehdyt sulavuuskokeet osoittivat, että tärkkelyksen sulavuus vasta kypsytetyissä rehuissa oli 97—98.6 %. Orgaanisen aineen sulavuus oli vastaavasti 77.5—83.1 %. Huonoimmin kypsytetyt rehut edustivat alempia lukuja, mutta kaikkien sulavuus voidaan katsoa hyväksi.",

Pyrittäessä voimaperäisellä lannoituksella korkeaan satotasoon, on tällä seikalla huomattava käytännöllinen merkitys useimmilla tutkituista lajikkeista. Aineiston vähäisyyden takia ei päätelmiä voida tehdä Ruso-vehnän ja Pendek-kauran osalta. Suurimmat sadonlisäykset on saatu kevätvehnällä, sitten ovat olleet järjestyksessä ruis ja ohra syysvehnän jäädessä viimeiseksi. Syysviljoilla kevätkäsittely on ollut tehokkaampi kuin syyskäsittely. Kaikilla viljoilla on korsi lyhentynyt sitä enemmän, mitä myöhemmin keväällä käsittely on suoritettu. Ottaen huomioon sadonlisäykset ja muut käytännön näkökohdat, on etusijalle asetettava se ajankohta, jolloin rikkakasvien ruiskutukset suoritetaan. Yleisenä piirteenä on todettavissa, että klormekvatti-käsittely lisää satoa eniten silloin kun kasvuolosuhteet sallivat korkean satotason muodostumisen. Myös sadon laatu paranee tällöin sen ansiosta. Epäedullisissa kasvuoloissa sadonlisäykset jäävät vähäisemmiksi ja sadot saattavat jopa alentua. Tämän vuoksi lannoituksen voimaperäisyyden ja maan muun kunnon huomioonottaminen on tarpeellista klormekvattikäsittelyn yhteydessä mm. käyttömäärien kohdalla.",

    "abstract": "Sekä mustaan neularei’itettyyn polyeteeniin että voimapaperiin pakattuna ollut hyvälaatuinen pesty peruna säilyi mukaisena, 4—6 °C:ssa varastoidun perunan veroisena kolme viikkoa 10 °C:ssa ja kaksi viikkoa 22 °C:ssa. Korkealaatuinen peruna säilyi pestynä 22°C:ssa kolme viikkoa ja 10°:ssa jopa seitsemän viikkoa molemmissa pakkauksissa ruoka- perunaominaisuuksiltaan moitteettomana, vaikka se olikin erotettavissa mukaisena 4–6 °C:ssa varastoidusta perunasta. Nämä säilyvyysajat ovat markkinoinnin kannalta riittävät, sillä pakkauksen ja kulutuksen välillä todennäköisesti kuluva aika on noin kaksi—kolme viikkoa. Pakattavan perunan laadulla ja kasvukauden aikana vaikuttavilla tekijöillä kuten lannoituksella todettiin olevan ratkaiseva merkitys perunan ruokaperunaominaisuuksien säilymiseen. Jos pakattava perunamateriaali on heikkolaatuista joko virustautisen siemenen tai liian voimakkaan lannoituksen takia, huononee tavaran laatu huomattavasti nopeammin kuin hyvälaatuisen perunan, jopa niin että sen kelpoisuus ruokaperunaksi tulee kyseenalaiseksi lyhyessäkin säilytyksessä pakkauksesta riippumatta. Tulosten mukaan musta polyeteeni esti parhaiten perunoiden vihertymisen. Vihertyminen osoittautui säilyvyyttä rajoittavaksi tekijäksi, jos perunat joutuivat voimakkaan loistelamppuvalaistuksen alaisiksi. Vesihöyryn ja hiilidioksidin läpäisevyys oli runsainta voimapaperipakkauksessa. Neularei’ityksellä saatiin polyeteenipakkaus kauttaaltaan kaasuja läpäiseväksi. Vesihöyryn läpäisevyys oli neularei’ityksen ansiosta riittävä; se esti mm. kondenssiveden muodostuksen pakkauksen sisäpintaan varaston lämpötilan muutosten yhteydessä.",

    "abstract": "As general conclusions of the performed regression analysis it can be established that the increase of both agricultural and forest land areas increases the sales price less than proportionally (elasticity &lt; 1) and that the area of arable land, the forest land and the dummy variables explain, in 1961, about 43 %, in 1962 29 % and in 1966 about 39 % of the changes of the sales prices of farm estates in the whole country. From the provincial models it can be observed that the variance of sales prices explained is highest in the field cultivation territory, i.e. the provinces Turun ja Porin lääni, Hämeen lääni and Kymen lääni, in which it varies from 42—58 %. On the other hand, in the ’’forest region” of Finland, i.e. in the provinces Keski-Suomen lääni and Pohjois-Karjalan lääni, the variance explained was also high, being 33—52 %. The lowest R2‘s were found in the provinces Mikkelin lääni, Vaasan lääni and Oulun lääni. Thus many other factors, such as the quality of the land, the location of the estate with regard to population centers, the buildings, roads and environmental factors, which could not be included in this research, are evidently important arguments of the sales price. It would thus be necessary to expand the research in suchwise that the explanatory efficiency of the mentioned variables would be tested, which would, again, mean a considerable decrease of the size of the sample, because it would be necessary to obtain the data by means of expensive field research and interviews (BRIGHAM 1965). As it is difficult to find out the movements of the price level of farm estates by means of the regression analysis, here will be given the sales prices of estates in the whole country by averages, according to size categories, which averages are compared with the development of the indicators of the general price level (the basic year being the same in all series, 1961 = 100). 1961, 1962, 1966; The wholesale price index: the general index of home market goods (1935 = 100) 100 102 122; The producer price index for agricultural products (1937—39 = 100) 100 102 132; The cost of living index (X 1951 = 100) 100 104 131; The sales prices of farm estates in the whole country according to the total area: area 2—5 hectares 100 116 144; „ 5—10 „ 100 113 157; „ 10—20 „ 100 110 138; „ 20—50 „ 100 104 151; „ 50— „ 100 127 148; The sales prices of farm estates in the whole country according to the area of arable land: area 2—5 hectares 100 110 136; „ 5—10 „ 100 106 149; „ 10-20 „ 100 101 156; „ 20—50 „ 100 135 160; The sales prices of farm estates in the whole country according to the forest land area: area 2—5 hectares 100 122 154; „ 5-10 „ 100 109 156; „ 10—20 „ 100 100 140; „ 20—50 „ 100 113 163; „ 50— „ 100 125 131. As can be observed from the above table and figure 1 the sales prices of farm estates have risen considerably more in the years 1961—1966 than the general price level as measured by the Wholesale Price Index or the Cost of Living Index. Relatively the greatest price increase has taken place in farm estates with 5–10 hectares, and thereafter in sequence farm estates with 20—50 hectares, more than 50 hectares, 2—5 hectares and 10—20 hectares. It is also to be observed that the sales prices of all farm estates have risen more than the Producer Price Index for Agricultural Products.",

    "abstract": "A gas chromatographic study has been made of the volatile aroma components of black-currant. The material consisted of 12 home-grown varieties from 6 localities taken over a period of 2 years, although the series are not complete. Separate investigation was made of the low-boiling and high-boiling parts of the aroma; in the former case, material of two years was studied, and in the latter case, that of one year only. The lower-boiling components were isolated in chilled adsorption tubes from a nitrogen stream led through a berry homogenate at room temperature. Analysis was effected at 80°C with a polyetylene glycol/teflon column (the same mass served as filling for the adsorption tubes). In all, 13 components were registered, although their occurrence, and the amounts in the different samples, were somewhat variable. As regards the different factors, the variety exercised no more than a slight effect on the aroma picture, whereas weather conditions were important, influencing the frequency of the peaks and the general aroma level; a cool summer increased the level. The northernness of the growing locality had a similar effect, although this result its of preliminary nature. The degree of ripeness and the condition had a considerable effect; the level of aromagrams was higher with more ripe samples, and in particular the ethanol content, which forms the bulk of the low-boiling aroma, was increased. A positive correlation was detected between the height of the ethanol peak and the total aroma or aroma number. By contrast, the height of the methanol peak exhibited a slight negative correlation with the degree of esterification of the pectin. The higher-boiling compounds were isolated by vacuum distillation and subsequent extraction with ether. In the gas chromatography, use was made of a butandiol succinate polyester/celite column, and the temperatures were 120 and 150°C. In all, 25 components were observed. Of the various factors, the variety showed a clear-cut influence on the aroma picture, as differences in the occurrence of the peaks and the relative heights were noted between the varieties; in this series, quantitative comparisons between the samples were impossible. The effect of locality and degree of ripeness is less well defined. Organoleptic checking showed that the changes were small in isolation of the lower-boiling components. In contrast, isolation of the higher-boiling compounds induced more changes, so that an aroma fraction obtained in the organic solvent was more terpene-like than the original aroma.",

The clearing of these so called cold farms has been an extensive task requiring much work and capital. In 1963 when the material for this paper was collected the work was partly unfinished nor has it been completed as yet (Uudistilakom. osamiet. II 1964, p. 2). The main part of the foundation work had, however, been brought to an end. The investigation at hand tries to find out which features have been considered by the farmers as the greatest disadvantages on the farms in question at the stage when the greater part of the foundation work had been carried out. In addition, plans made by the farmers to eliminate the said disadvantages as well as their opinions on the size of a farm giving sufficient means of livelihood are examined. The investigation, which has been financed by a grant made by the U. S. Department of Agriculture under P. L. 480, is associated with an extensive landeconomic research and forms a part of it. The research which was started by agricultural and forestry experts as a teamwork in 1959, studies the economics of alternative use of land for agriculture or forestry (cf. PIHKALA 1965, p. 32).",

    "abstract": "For the effective utilization of microorganisms, either in biotechnology or agriculture, it is necessary to increase their original activity considerably. This can be performed by selection because even pure cultures of microorganisms are genetically heterogenous. The determination of the activity in a given strain is carried out in cultivation experiments. The error in the figures obtained decreases with repetition of the process. However, repetition of the determination raises the expenses. This can be compensated by reducing the number of strains included in the repeated experiments. This may involve a loss of profitable strains. The problem thus lies in choosing a selection procedure which minimizes labour and costs. In looking for the most suitable selection procedure mathematical methods may be used. However, in most cases it is difficult to get numerical results, even when assumptions are introduced for the sake of simplification. Computer simulation provides an alternative to solving some of the problems. For other problems it may be possible to find intuitive solutions which may not be the best ones, but are close to them.",

Lehden lämpötila mitattiin vastuslämpömittarilla. Lisäksi selvitettiin Cycocelin ja Phosfonin vaikutusta pimeässä, pitkä-aaltoisessa UV-valossa, hehkulampun valossa ja päivänvalossa (tammi-maaliskuun aikana). Kokeiden tarkoituksena oli selvittää mikä osuus valo-oloilla on siihen, että Phosfonin teho on kesällä todettu paremmaksi kuin talvella ja Cycocelin ja B-ninen päinvastoin. Suoritetuissa kokeissa todettiin seuraavaa: Valon määrä ei vaikuttanut suoranaisesti B-ninen, Cycocelin ja Phosfonin pituuskasvua rajoittavaan tehoon tutkituilla valoisuusalueilla. Sääteiden vaikutusaste ei riippunut lehden lämpötilasta silloin, kun lehden lämpötilan kohotessa lisääntyi myös säteilyn määrä aaltoalueella 400—800 nm. Sen sijaan, jos lehden lämpötila kohosi mutta säteilyn määrä ei lisääntynyt, pieneni B-ninen ja Cycocelin vaikutusaste merkitsevästi. Kokeissa käytetty Cycocel-määrä stimuloi pituuskasvua pimeässä, UV-valossa ja hehkulampun valossa, mutta ehkäisi sitä päivänvalossa. Phosfon rajoitti selvästi pituuskasvua päivänvalossa ja UV-valossa mutta ei hehkulampun valossa. Pimeässä Phosfon hillitsi pituuskasvua merkitsevästi, mutta selvästi vähemmän kuin UV- ja päivänvalossa. Sääleillä käsitellyissä taimissa assimilaattien nettokertyminen (assimilaattikertymä) oli 100 %:n valoisuustasolla suurempi kuin käsittelemättömissä kasveissa. Hehkulampun valossa Cycocel ja etenkin Phosfon pienensi assimilaattikertymää. Sääteiden vaikutus lehtipinta-alaan sekä tuore- ja kuivapainoon ei ollut yhtäsuuri eikä aina samansuuntainen kuin pituuskasvuun. Phosfon ja Cycocel lisäsivät tuore- ja kuivapainon kasvua pimeässä. Muissa käsittelyissä Phosfon yleensä vähensi niitä. Cycocel ja B-nine lisäsivät tai vähensivät muista käsittelyistä riippuen.",

    "abstract": "Die vorliegende Untersuchung behandelt die allgemeine Zusammensetzung des in Finnland produzierten Hühnereies. Es wurden die Eier aus fünf Betrieben analysiert. Das Futter, die Rasse und der Typ des Betriebes sind bekannt. Auf Grund von repräsentativen Proben wurden Beobachtungen über die Gewichts Verhältnisse der verschiedenen Bestandteile gemacht und der Gehalt an Trockenmasse, Fett, Protein, A-Vitamin, Karotin, Aminosäuren, sowie Mineralstoffen analytisch bestimmt. Der Gehalt an folgenden Mineralien wurde bestimmt: Kalium, Kalzium, Kupfer, Natrium und Eisen. Weiter wurden die verschiedenen Fraktionen des Eigelb-Fettes und dessen Fettsäurenzusammensetzung untersucht. Die Resultate finden sich in den Tabellen. Die Resultate zeigen, dass die in Finnland produzierten Hühnereier ihrer Zusammensetzung nach mit denen anderer Länder vergleichbar sind, über welche Angaben in Handbüchern zu finden sind. Der Anteil des Eiweisses ist jedoch verhältnismässig gross und derjenige des Eigelbes klein im Vergleich mit den Angaben der Handbücher. Im Fett-Teil treten die Fettsäuren C14 und C20 reichlich auf, aber C18 -Säuren finden sich weniger im Vergleich zu den Werten in der Literatur. Der Kupfer- und Eisengehalt des Eiweisses, sowie der Natrium- und Kupfergehalt des Eigelbes sind etwas höher als die in den Handbüchern allgemein angegebenen Werte.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to find out what changes take place in the quantities of the ash components of Baltic herring fillets, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals, chloride and phosphate, when the fillets are kept in chloride and phosphate solutions. It was hoped that these experiments might give information on the nature of the protective effect of phosphate, as it is capable of preventing harmful changes in the myofibrillar proteins, caused by NaCl solution. The standing solutions were 3 % NaCl, 1 % Na pyrophosphate, and a solution containing both these salts. The fillets were investigated at the beginning and after a storage of 1 and 5 days. The total ash, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cl, and P was analyzed in the fillets. The original values obtained were compared with the values given for Baltic herring and herring in the literature, as far as such data were available. The Na and Cl values of Baltic herring obtained here were somewhat lower than those reported for herring. The values obtained for K, Ca and P are somewhat high, but still the values in general agree in range with the values in the literature. Storage in the solutions increased the values of ash, even if this increase in regard to the pyrophosphate solution was only stated if the ash values were calculated for the original weights of the fillets. As far the metals were concerned, the amount of Na increased in all cases, as both chloride and pyrophosphate were used as Na salts. By contrast, the amount of K was considerably decreased, the amount of Mg less and that of Ca still less. The loss of K and Mg continued progressively for the whole standing period, while the amount of Ca returned towards the original value after a decrease during the first day. With all the metals the size of the change depended on the strength of the standing solution. The amount of chloride in the fillets was increased if storage took place in solutions containing NaCl; immigration of Cl was independent of the presence of pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate alone extracted Cl from the fillets almost completely. The amount of phosphate in the fillets was again decreased in all the solutions, the decrease being greatest when the standing solution contained no phosphate; even then, the fillets still retained approx. 23 % of the original P. When the standing solution contained phosphate, the loss of P was small and independent of the presence of chloride. When the metals and anions investigated were calculated as equivalents, it was stated that in all cases there was an excess of cations in the fillets. During standing, changes took place in the cation excess. When standing in pyrophosphate solution alone, a small progressive increase of the cation excess was observable, while when standing in NaCl solution alone, the cation excess first decreased strongly and then partly returned towards the original value. If the solution in addition contained also pyrophosphate, the decrease was much less noticeable. In this respect the pyrophosphate has clearly inhibited the effect of NaCl, and this may be connected with the influence of pyrophosphate protecting the myofibrillar proteins.",

Myöhäinen typpilannoitus kohotti raakavalkuaisen ja kostean sitkon pitoisuutta jyvissä; pienemmällä typpimäärällä oli lähes yhtä hyvä vaikutus kuin suuremmalla. Sitkon laatuun ei typpilannoitus vaikuttanut. Typpilannoitus ei myöskään vaikuttanut tärkkelyksen diastaattiseen tilaan. Leivinominaisuuksien pieni paraneminen johtui siten lähinnä sitkon määrän lisääntymisestä. Käytettyjen typpilannoitteiden, urean ja kalkkisalpietarin, vaikutus oli samanlainen. Typpilannoituksen kanssa samanaikaisesti annettu MCPA-ruiskutus ei vaikuttanut selvästi typpilannoituksen tehoon. Tutkituista lajikkeista (Svenno, Touko, Nora ja Apu) oli Svennon α-amylaasiaktiviteeti muita suurempi.

The fish were packed whole in polyethylene bags. The radiation doses varied for pike between 150—1200 krad and for saithe between 150—250 krad. Organoleptic evaluations showed burnt off-flavour and off-odour in irradiated pike, which in fish that had been subject to small doses of 150 and 250 krad disappeared only after about one week of storing under refrigeration. For saithe no off-flavour was noticed when it was irradiated with a dose below 250 krad. After radiation at only 150 krad for saithe and 300 krad for pike the total bacterial counts in the muscle were reduced by nearly 100 per cent. With radiation doses of 150, 250 and 300 krad, the shelf life of pike under refrigeration increased 2.5, 3.5 and 5.2 times, respectively, compared with non-irradiated fish. The shelf-life times listed in the same order were 10, 14 and 21 days, but for non-irradiated fish only 4 days. For saithe the shelf life increased from 23 days (of non-irradiated fish) to 40 days when irradiated with a dose of only 150 krad. When whole fish were irradiated with large doses of 600 and 1200 krad, spoilage caused by bacteria was prevented for a long time while enzymatic spoilage caused by intestines was detected after 38 days as the contents of the intestines became decomposed and the flesh at the side of the abdominal cavity turned soft.",

    "abstract": "In the dry summers 1964, 1965 and 1966, irrigation experiments of spring cereals were carried out on clay soils in Southern Finland. The soils having a rather poor structure because of the long-term cultivation without leys, endured without slaking the irrigation which was applied with »slow sprinklers» in the nigh-time. Neutral irrigation water containing small amounts of soluble salts was taken from a brook and a lake. One irrigation of 30—37 mm, applied at the optimum date, increased the grain yields of spring wheat 600—1000 kg/ha or 25—50 % and those of barley and oats 1600 kg/ha or 50 %. Barley and oats were the experimental plants only in 1966, when the relative increase in yields of all the three cereals were of the same order, namely 50 %. The optimum date of irrigation did not very closely depend on the state of development of the cereals, since within 2—5 weeks from sprouting about equal increases in yield could be obtained. Barley and oats responded, however, best to the irrigation applied one week before ear emergence. The late irrigation which was applied three days after ear emergence was best utilized by oats. Thus, the right order to irrigate cereals was in 1966: wheat, barley and oats, in spite of the reverse order of the ripening of the crops. An irrigation at the stage of sprouting had no effect on yield, because the sprouting occured well also without irrigation. Irrigation produced higher increases in yield when higher amounts of fertilizer were used. Thus, the profitable influence of irrigation was at least partly based on the better recovery of fertilizer nutrients by plants. Placement of fertilizer into the depth of 8—12 cm postponed the optimum date of irrigation some days, because the crops were able to make use of placed fertilizer also without irrigation in the early part of the summer. Placement of fertilizer and irrigation together formed an advantageous combination, because the influence of the placement of fertilizer was most effective immediately after sprouting whereas the best period of irrigation began 2—3 weeks later. With these both means, in the best cases, the yields could be almost doubled.",

Maatilatalouden rakennemuutokset ja viljelymenetelmien vaihtaminen ovat olleet tärkeitä keinoja maanviljelijän koettaessa mukautua alati liikkeellä olevaan taloudelliseen kehitykseen. Perinnäisen maatalouden kaudella esihistoriallisen ajan lopulta 1800-luvulle tekninen kehitys oli varsin hidasta, mutta nopeampaa kehitystä tapahtui taloudellisen toiminnan alalla maatilatalouden painopisteen siirtyessä jatkuvasti sektorilta toiselle tai rinnakkaisesta viljelymenetelmästä toiseen. Käsitys maatalouskehityksemme staattisesta luonteesta perinnäisen maatalouden kaudella, joka perustuu yksipuolisesti teknisen kehityksen hitauteen, osoittautuu näin ollen harhakuvaksi. Viimeisen sadan vuoden aikana maatalouskehityksen luonne on suuresti muuttunut. Kehitykselle on ollut luonteenomaista nopeasti edistyvä maataloustekniikka ja siirtyminen omavaraistaloudesta vaihdantatalouteen. Seurauksena on ollut sopeutumisvaikeuksia sekä maatalouden tuotantoyksiköille, maatiloille, että maatalousväestölle. Huomattavalta osalta näistä sopeutumisvaikeuksista johtuu, että maatalouden taloudellisen ja sosiaalisen kehityksen välillä on ollut kitkaa ja maatalouden tuottavuuden kasvu on jäänyt jälkeen yleisestä taloudellisesta kasvusta.",

As uniformity in the terminology in different countries would be of advantage for research work in this field as well as in practical life, it would be desirable that collaboration to this end could be brought about. In different connections the question of what is or should be understood by home economics has been raised. The point has been discussed e.g. by EGNER (1952) and DUBBERKE (1958). In the Finnish literature there are only a few references to the matter (HARMAJA 1946, SAURIO 1938, SAURIO 1947). – The present writer has come to the conclusion that home economics involve a unit formed by one or more persons, the object of its economic action being to create a possibility of satisfying immediate human needs within the limits of private economy. As the results of the production of home economics are used within the limits of the same economic unit, an analysis of their profitableness meets with considerable difficulties. However, in view of the importance of the matter to private as well as national economy, special means for proving the »return» yielded by home economics, i.e. its profitableness, should be evolved.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper the influence of season on the peak production, the duration of the ascending phase, the persistency of lactation, the 12 month production, and the live weight of the cows in the Ayrshire herd of the University of Helsinki experimental farm Viik are investigated. The material consists of cows calving during the period 1950—1965. During this time the indoor feeding was very intensive, satisfying all the nutritional requirements of the cows. At the same time the pastures were intensively cultivated. The size of the herd varied between 60 and 70 cows. The cows were divided into three groups: 1) spring calving cows, 2) cows calving during the pasre season, and 3) autumn calving cows. During the pasture season the peak production of cows in first lactation is c. 2 kg and of cows in later lactations c. 3.5 kg lower than during the indoor feeding period. The peak production of spring and autumn calving cows is on an average approximately the same. The duration of the ascending phase of cows calving during the pasture season is 6—10 days shorter than during the indoor feeding period. The length of the ascending phase is approximately the same for spring and autumn calving cows. The influence of season on the yield increase tangent, which is a measure of the rapidity of yield increase, is negligible. Cows calving during the pasture season and in the autumn are considerably more persistent in their lactations (P2:1-values higher) than cows freshening in the spring. The persistency values of cows calving during the pasture season and in the autumn are on an average approximately equally high. The 12 month lactation yields of autumn calving cows in the different age groups are 400—600 kg, i.e.c. 10 % higher than the corresponding values for cows freshening in spring and during the pasture season. The lactation yields of cows calving in spring and during the pasture season are on an average approximately equally high. The superiority in lactation yield of cows calving in the autumn compared to cows calving in the spring is due to the better persistency of lactation of the autumn calving cows. On the other hand the superiority in lactation yield of autumn calving cows compared to cows calving during the pasture season is due to the higher peak production of the autumn calving cows. The lactation yields of cows calving in spring or during the pasture season are approximately equally high. During the pasture season the average live weight of the cows is 20—30 kg less than during the indoor feeding period, which is due to the smaller contents of the digestive tract of the cow during the pasture season.",

Omfattande svampskador är dock ingen regelbunden varje är återkommande företeelse, men under gynnsamma betingelser kan Sclerotinia borealis, Typhula ishikariensis och delvis även Fusarium nivale förorsaka t.o.m. total utgång av övervintrande vallar. Vissa år har S. borealis förorsakat de största skadorna, andra T. ishikariensis. Utvintringssvamparna är således faktorer, som genom ett oväntat massuppträdande inger osäkerhet vid odling av vallväxter under nordliga förhållanden. På vallarna i norr kan även uppträda köld- och vattenskador, de sistnämnda isynnerhet på kärrjordar. Det förädlingsmaterial av vallgräs, som nu odlas inom Nordkalottområdet, är beträffande resistensen mot utvintringssvampar det härdigaste som star att fä. Också detta material är emellertid mottagligt för angrepp under för svamparnas massuppträdande gynnsamma betingelser, och det krävs helt säkert dryga arbetsinsatser av växtförädlarna för att kunna höja resistensen mot nämnda patogener. För att reducera skadorna förorsakade av utvintringssvampar bör endast de mest motståndskraftigaste, tili rådande nordliga förhållanden acklimatiserade förädlingarna odlas. Det kan antas, att en riklig, väl avvägd P-, K- och N-gödsling stärker växterna inför övervintringsperioden. Genom fungicidbehandling av bestånden på senhösten med främst PCNB-(kvintozen-) preparat kan övervintringen i stor utsträckning säkras.

    "abstract": "Edellä selostettu tutkimus on kohdistunut 200 maanviljelijään keskiarvoa vauraammalla maatalousseudulla. Kolme neljästä viljelijästä oli yhteistoiminnassa muiden viljelijöiden kanssa. Joka kolmas yhteistoimintaryhmä oli ihmistyövoiman vaihtoa ja n. 60 % kaikista ryhmistä oli tekemisissä maatalouskoneiden kanssa. Pienviljelijät vaihtoivat työtä, suuremmilla tiloilla yhteistyö useammin liittyi koneisiin. Nuoremmat ikäluokat enemmän suosivat yhteistyötä yleensä ja erityisesti koneiden vaihtoa. Yhteistoiminnan määrä ei ollut riippuvaisuussuhteessa tilan koneistumisasteeseen, mutta kylläkin jossain määrin isännän uudistuksellisuuteen. Yhteistoiminnassa olivat kaikenkokoiset tilat keskenään, joskin yhteistoiminta hieman useammin tapahtui samankokoisten tilojen välillä. Suunnilleen joka kolmas kumppaneista oli sukulainen. Tilakoon kasvaessa tai isännän iän aletessa näytti sukulaisten osuus kasvavan. Asenteet maatalouteen yleensä eivät näyttäneet riippuvan yhteistoiminnallisuudesta. Viljelijät olivat tyytyväisiä nykyiseen yhteistoimintaansa. Se ei ollut huomattavasti vähentänyt heidän itsenäisyyttään. Enemmistö ei maininnut mitään epäkohtia, ja melkein kaikki ajattelivat jatkaa vallitsevaa yhteistoimintaa. Mitä intensiivisemmin viljelijä oli yhteistoiminnassa, sitä myönteisemmin hän suhtautui yhteistoiminnan lisäämiseen. Mutta jos yhteistoiminta uhkasi supistaa hänen itsemääräämisoikeuttaan, hänen asenteensa muuttui kielteiseksi. Yhteistoiminta maanviljelijöiden välillä on vanha perinne, joka on elänyt maatalouden voimakkaasta muuttumisesta huolimatta meidän päiviimme asti. Se on kyllä jossain määrin muuttunut, mm. koneiden vaihto ja koneiden yhteisomistus ovat tulleet uutena muotona työnvaihdon rinnalle. Mutta muuttuminen juuri osoittaa elinkelpoisuutta, joka mahdollistaa myös tietoisen muuttamisen nykyolosuhteisiin soveltuvaksi. Pienen tilakokomme takia nimenomaan koneistamisen kannattavuus muodostaa vaikean ongelman, jonka eräs ratkaisu saattaisi löytyä lisääntyvästä yhteistoiminnasta. Yhteistoiminta olisi siis taloudelliselta kannalta katsottuna hyvä ratkaisu. Mutta muotoja suunniteltaessa ja pyrittäessä elvyttämään on muistettava, että yhteistoiminta viljelijöiden välillä on ennen kaikkea sosiaalinen ilmiö. Jos se kyetään suunnittelemaan ja toteuttamaan siten, että sen piirissä vallitsevat ihmissuhteet ovat osallistujia tyydyttäviä, on yhteistoiminta mahdollista ja antaa myös hyvän taloudellisen tuloksen. Mutta jos ihmissuhteet ovat sopimattoman organisaatiomuodon tai taitamattoman asioiden hoitamisen tai osallistujien sopeutumattoman luonteen takia ristiriitaisia, ei yhteistoiminta onnistu hyvin eikä liioin johda hyvään taloudelliseenkaan tulokseen.",

Jede Probe enthielt die Lebern von 5 verschiedenen Tieren. Aus den Proben wurde die chemische Zusammensetzung, der Vitamin-A-, Thiamin-, Eisen- und Kupfergehalt bestimmt. Die Fettsäurenzusammensetzung des Fettes wurde aus Proben bestimmt, die im Herbst, Winter und Frühjahr entnommen worden waren. Von den untersuchten Nährstoffen zeigten nur die Vitamin-A-Werte deutliche jahreszeitliche Variationen. Am Ende der Weideperiode war der Vitamin-A-Gehalt der Rinderleber mit 68.000 i.E./100 g über 7-fach höher als zu Beginn der Weideperiode mit 9000 i.E./100 g. Die grössten Unterschiede in den Vitamin-A-Werten der Rinder- und Schweineleber traten in den im Herbst untersuchten Proben auf, als der Vitamin-A-Gehalt der Schweineleber fast nur halb so gross war als derjenige der Rinderleber.",

Um das Lagern hervorzurufen, wurde Stickstoffdüngung in drei Stufen (25, 50 und 100 kg N/ha) gegeben. Die Spritzung mit CCC (3 kg/ha) verursachte eine deutliche Erhöhung der Standfestigkeit und zwar aus dem Grunde, dass alle Internodien kürzer und somit der gesamte Pflanzenbestand niedriger blieben. Zugleich verminderte sich allerdings der Kornertrag um 13 %. Dies beruhte wahrscheinlich darauf, dass das Wachsen des Kornes vorzeitig unterbrochen wurde. Der Minderertrag konnte verhindert werden, indem die gleichzeitig mit der CCC-Spritzung zu gebende Stickstoffdüngung gesteigert wurde. Zugleich konnte die Standfestigkeit noch erhöht werden. Die CCC-Spritzung hatte keinen Einfluss auf die Nährstoffaufnahme der Pflanze, aber die Gehalte an den untersuchten Nährstoffen (N, P und K) nahmen als Folge der Spritzung mit CCC wegen der verminderten Korn- und Stroherträge zu.",

Apatite may be a suitable phosphorus fertilizer in forest manuring on bog peat soils. The carbonate included as an impurity in apatite may also be beneficial. By the use of not readily soluble phosphorus fertilizers one may diminish the possibilities of phosphorus entering water systems; this should be taken into consideration when the areas to be fertilized are very large.",

    "abstract": "The present shape of agriculture in every country is the result of a complex of past economic, social and political factors. These factors are continuously under pressure from new forces. Today, for better or for worse, the pursuit of economic growth has become the dominant force the world over. In order to achieve and sustain a more rapid rate of growth two things are necessary. The first is to improve productivity within each activity by the greater application of capital, by better technology, by better management and by better organisation. The second is to aim at the optimum allocation of resources between activities by moving resources from less to more productive uses. Pursuing these two paths towards faster growth is releasing two sets of forces which are exerting a radical impact on both the size and the pattern of agriculture. This paper deals with this impact on agriculture in contemporary Britain a highly industrial and a preponderantly urban nation committed to the experiment of running a hybrid economy based on the two pillars of private enterprise and public control.",

Statistical treatment of the data revealed that the milk yield affected the protein content of the milk more than its fat content, especially in the first-calvers. The protein-fat correlation, which was somewhat affected by the milk yield, was generally less close during the early stage of lactation than during its later stage. The percentage of variation in a) the milk yield that was explained by the variations in the percentage of fat and protein, was affected more by age than by the stage of lactation, b) the fat content of milk that was explained by the variations in the milk yield and the protein content of milk, was influenced more by the stage of lactation than by the age of the cow, c) the protein content of milk that was explained by the variations in milk yield and the fat content, was influenced by age as well as by stage of lactation. The equations for estimating theoretically the daily milk yield, the percentage of fat, or the percentage of protein in milk, when two out of the three variables are known, have been presented separately for the first-calvers and for the older cows at early and at later stages as well as during the entire period of lactation. The results of the study indicated that the milk yields and the percentages of fat and protein in milk vary to such an extent independently of each other, even when the age of cows, the stage of lactation, and the season of the year have been taken into consideration, that none of the dependent variables in question could be very closely estimated on the basis of knowing two of the independent variables.",

This has been achieved by identifying and classifying the variety owners for major crops based on the origin of the breeding station and calculating the percentage of the domestically-bred varieties used in crop production. The ratio of local varieties in relation to imported varieties is of special significance to Sweden, which has a long history of plant breeding and a challenging climate.",

This retrospective study aimed to elaborate factors behind the declining foaling rates in Finnhorses using multivariable logit models. The mating records from years 1998 to 2000 (period 1, n = 5967) and 2002 to 2004 (period 2, n = 5373) originated from the Finnish trotting and breeding association. The over-all foaling rate was 66.6% during period 1 and 62.4% during period 2 (p &lt; 0.0001). Foaling rate for on-site artificial insemination decreased from 70.2% to 64.8% (p = 0.003). The proportion of the most fertile mare groups, 2–9-year-olds and foaled mares, decreased by 8.2 and 7.1 percentage points, respectively. Differences in foaling rates between young and middle-aged mares, and maiden and foaled mares changed from non-significant to significant (p&lt;0.0001) due to the foaling rate decline in middle-aged (p = 0.001) and maiden mares (p = 0.01). The decline in foaling rate was also significant for barren and rested mares (p &lt; 0.05), natural mating (p = 0.01), and book size &gt;68 (p &lt; 0.0001). It was concluded that multiple factors were responsible for the foaling rate decline.",

High-energy diets contained 19.3 MJ metabolisable energy (ME) in kg dry matter (DM) and high-protein diets contained digestible crude protein (DCP) 20% of ME. Low-energy diets contained 16.3 MJ ME in kg DM and low-protein diets DCP 17% of ME. Feeding was gradually increased towards ad libitum. Reduced ME intake had no effect on pelt size or pelt quality.

Seven different cropping systems were investigated: four conventional with different treatments of mineral nitrogen fertilisers and three organic including catch crops and cattle manure treatment. The DM yield of field pea in winter wheat mineral N treatments 50–150 kg N ha-1 was 2699–2852 kg ha-1, which was 33% higher than in the organic systems. There were no significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and N surplus between 50–150 kg N ha-1. The first 20 kg ha-1 mineral N with P25 and K95 gave a significantly higher pea yield compared to the treatment without mineral N. The catch crops reduced agronomic NUE and increased N surplus in the organic cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "In 1968, thyroid glands were obtained from young dairy animals born and raised in the areas of various Agricultural Societies of Finland. Breed, sex and carcass weight were recorded for each case. The thyroids were weighed and preparations made for the histological examination. The relative proportions of epithelium (E %), colloid (C %) and stroma (S %), and the height of the epithelial cells (Eμ), were estimated with histometric methods, and the absolute amount of epithelial tissue in grams per gland (Eg) was calculated. The relative size of the follicles (FN) was also determined. The glands were classified, on the basis of prevailing histological characteristics, into activity groups indicated by numbers from 1 (low) to 6 (high). The glands in groups 5 and 6 were considered histologically as abnormal. The data included both Ayrshires (375 ♂ and 239 ♀) and Finncattle (276 ♂ and 234 ♀), and was characterized by the following mean and range values: carcass weight 66.6 kg (7—214), thyroid weight 12.95 g (2.1—130.0), E % 26.1 (14.4—88.2), C % 70.2 (4.1—85.1), S % 3.7 (0.9—14.6), Eμ 5.0 (2.2—22.5), Eg 3.77 (0.44—98.15), FN 21.9 (9.0—84.7), histological activity 3.0 (1—6). Data obtained from the Ayrshire herd of the Viik Experimental Farm was used as a control material for this study. The correlation study revealed that breed and sex had very little effect on the various thyroid characteristics. Carcass weight, on the other hand, correlated significantly with all other thyroid characteristics except the E %. In order to evaluate the geographic distribution of goitre the data was divided into 15 groups according to the Agricultural Society in whose area the animals were born and raised. Effect of carcass weight on the weight, Eg, and histological activity of the thyroid was first eliminated (e.g. by calculating the deviations from the respective control values) before the 15 groups were comparable with each other. Investigations revealed that the thyroid weight, Eg, and E % were raised and the percentage of histologically abnormal glands was high in the Agricultural Societies of the District of Nyland &amp; Nyland’s Swedish, the District of Tavastland, East-Tavastland, the District of Mikkeli, and North-Karelia. On the other hand, hardly any or no signs of goitre were found in the Agricultural Societies of Satakunta, Tavastland-Satakunta, and Kuopio. Attention was also paid to the consumption of iodized mineral salt mixtures by cattle in the various Agricultural Societies. The extent of variation found in the consumption rate was not, however, large enough to explain satisfactorily the differences in the goitre incidence. Since the mean consumption rate in whole Finland in 1967 was only 1/3 of that of the control herd, it is concluded that the amounts of supplemental iodine in the cattle rations should be considerably increased.",

In the first four years, more thoroughly studied, the response to the store dressing with rock phosphate was distinct both in the dry matter yields and the phosphorus content of the cereal and the red clover-timothy hay. The differences between the various rates of rock phosphate treatments were not statistically significant, though there was some tendency to higher results with larger amounts of rock phosphate. The annual applications of superphosphate as surface dressing to the ley did not brought about any significant increase in the dry matter yield of the rock phosphate plots, and although they tended to increase the phosphorus content of hay, the increase was statistically significant only in a few cases. No effect was found on the phosphorus content of barley grain and straw in the ninth experimental year. No differences were found in the calcium, magnesium, or potassium content of the plant samples from the variously treated plots. Nitrogen content of clover and timothy was increased by both rock phosphate and superphosphate, particularly in the first year ley. In this soil, 4000 kg/ha of rock phosphate was effective enough to produce higher dry matter yields of hay, with equal phosphorus content, than the annual application of 200 kg/ha of superphosphate. Soil analyses indicated that this soil represented the extreme pattern of phosphorus retention in which applied phosphate is almost completely retained as aluminium bound forms of the fluoride soluble fraction supposed to be fairly available. It was suggested that in soils which retain the slowly dissolving rock phosphate phosphorus mainly as less available iron bound forms, heavy applications of rock phosphate will not be a profitable way to improve the phosphorus conditions.",

Three varieties, Puikula, Tanu and van Gogh, differing in earliness and storing properties, were used. Two sprouting treatments in the spring, i.e. varietal optimum and control with no sprouting, and four storage treatments, i.e. autumn, mid-winter, autumn and winter and control, were applied. A split-split-plot design was used. The emergence, stem and tuber numbers and yield were determined. Storage ageing enhanced the emergence up to 6 days depending on the cultivar and spring sprouting treatment. The tuber yield also increased by approx. 8 tn ha-1. The stem and tuber numbers were not affected by winter ageing. However, the enhancement in emergence and increase in tuber yield were not high enough to compensate for the need for proper spring sprouting. According to this study, storage ageing cannot replace proper sprouting.",

Kasvunsääteiden vaikutus pavun Phaseolus vulgaris var. vulgaris, kasvuun mitattiin taimivaiheessa kahtena ajankohtana: 10 vrk varhaislehtiasteella suoritettujen käsittelyjen jälkeen ja verrannetaimien ollessa 4-lehtiasteella kaikissa lämpötilakäsittelyissä. Pavun taimien pituuskasvuun vaikutti yölämpötila merkitsevästi. Taimien korkeus oli 10° C:ssa pienempi kuin 13 ja 18 asteessa. Yölämpötilojen väliset verson pituuden erot olivat varhaislehtiasteella suurempia kuin 4-lehtiasteella. Yölämpötilan pituuskasvua rajoittava vaikutus oli jonkin verran suurempi käsittelemättömissä kasveissa kuin kasvunsääteillä käsitellyissä kasveissa. Kaikki kasvunsäädekäsittelyt hillitsivät pituuskasvua. Niiden aiheuttama pituuskasvun rajoittuminen oli suurempi 18°:ssa kuin 13 ja 10° C:ssa. Phosfonilla käsiteltyjen taimien pituuskasvu oli vähäisintä. Cycocelin ja B-ninen kasvualustakäsittelyt rajoittivat pituuskasvua keskimääräisesti enemmän kuin ruiskutuskäsittelyt. Lämpötilan ja kasvunsäädekäsittelyjen välinen vuorovaikutus taimien pituuskasvussa ei ollut merkitsevä 10 vrk varhaislehtiasteen jälkeen, mutta oli merkitsevä 4-lehtiasteella.

    "abstract": "Apilamädän levinneisyydestä ja vahingollisuudesta on kerätty aineistoa vuosina 1946–1965 eri tahoille maatamme tehdyillä matkoilla sekä kirjeellisillä tiedusteluilla. Kaikkiaan 91 kunnan alueelta (kuva 3) on kerättyjä puhtaaksi viljelty yhteensä 392 apilan pahkahomenäytettä. Aineisto osoittaa, että sieni on levinnyt kaikkialle apilan tärkeimmälle viljelyalueella. Muistiinpanot apilan talvehtimisesta sekä säähavainnot 20 vuoden ajalta Tikkurilassa (taulukot 1 ja 2) osoittavat, että apilamätäepidemian puhkeaminen on ensi sijaisesti riippuvainen syyskauden sääoloista ja lähinnä kasvillisuuskerroksessa vallitsevasta kosteudesta. Lämpötilan suoranainen merkitys on ilmeisesti vähäisempi. Pakkaset kuitenkin pysähdyttävät epidemian, koska silloin ilman suhteellinen kosteus laskee sienenkannalta liian alhaiseksi. Pitkinä, verraten leutoina syksyinä apilamädän tuhot voivat muodostua huomattavan suuriksi, niinkuin torjuntakokeet osoittavat. Apilan pahkahomesienen on havaittu pellolla leviävän ja iskeytyvän apiloihin vielä 0°C:n lämpötilassa, joka on paljon alapuolella sienen rihmaston kasvun optimilämpötilan. Kotelomaljoja näyttää kehittyvän myös hyvin laajalla lämpötila-alueella, pakkasta ne eivät kumminkaan siedä. Runsaan lumipeitteen hidas sulaminen keväällä lisää maan pinnan kosteutta ja edistää apilamätätuhojen jatkumista vielä keväällä. Muutamien eri alkuperää olleiden pahkahome-isolaattien patogeenisuudessa oli siksi merkitseviä eroja, että niitä voidaan pitää sienen eri biotyyppeinä. Toisaalta sekä eri isolaattien patogeenisuus että apilalajikkeiden taudinalttius näyttävät olevan suuressa määrin ajan funktioita (kuvat 4 ja 5). Apilalajikkeiden taudinkestävyyserot perustuvat niiden kykyyn viivyttää taudin valtaan pääsyä, eivät todelliseen resistenssiin. Maassamme on runsaasti pitkäaikaisen sopeutumisen tuloksena syntyneitä paikallisia puna-apiloita, jotka saattavat olla jalostusaineistona arvokkaita. Vuosina 1946—1965 on suoritettu joukko apilamädän torjuntakokeita PCNB- eli kvintotseeni- valmisteilla eri tahoilla maata. Kun apilamädän esiintymisrunsaus vuosittain ja paikkakunnittain vaihtelee paljon, ja kun toisaalta torjuntakäsittelyjä on suoritettu monin erilaisin tavoin, ovat torjuntakokeiden tuloksetkin vaihtelevia. Kahdesti niitettäessä saatiin kaikista 145 käsittelystä keskimäärin tuoretta satoa lisää 41 %. Yhden kerran niitettäessä oli kuivan heinän lisäys 186 käsittelystä keskimäärin 26 % (taulukko 4). Kaikista käsittelyistä on lähes puolet tuottanut kahdella niittokerralla vähintään 21 % suuruisen tuoreen sadon lisäyksen ja yhdellä niittokerralla vajaa neljännes vähintään 21 % suuruisen kuivaheinäsadon lisäyksen (taulukko 5). Torjunnan onnistuminen riippuu ratkaisevasti sen aloittamisen ajankohdasta; torjunta on aloitettava ennen kuin apilamätä pääsee valtaan. Kun taudin puhkeaminen ja leviäminen voivat tapahtua vain kasvillisuuskerroksen ilmaston suhteellisen kosteuden ollessa hyvin korkea, lähes 100 %, on torjunnan ajankohta valittava syyskauden kosteusoloja seuraten. Joskus alkusyksyn oltua vähäsateinen on kokeissa riittänyt yksikin loka-marraskuussa suoritettu torjuntakäsittely, mutta varmempi tulos on saavutettu kahdella tai kolmella käsittelyllä syksyn aikana. Käytännössä on ilmeisesti tarkoituksenmukaista suorittaa ensimmäinen torjuntakäsittely syys-lokakuun vaihteessa jos alkusyksy on sateinen ja toistaa käsittely noin kuukauden kuluttua. Jos alkusyksy on kuiva, suoritetaan vain yksi käsittely loka-marraskuun vaihteen tienoilla. Riittäväksi tehoainemääräksi (PCNB) on osoittautunut 5—6 kg/ha. Aineen määrän lisääminen tästä voi toisinaan antaa täydellisemmän torjuntatuloksen, mutta ero on siksi vähäinen, ettei se useimmiten vastaa kustannusten lisäystä. Ruiskutteilla on usein saatu paremmat tulokset kuin pölytteillä, joka on johtunut siitä, että ruiskutteiden tasainen levitys on helpompaa kuin pölytteiden, muuten ei käyttömuodolla ole ollut merkitystä. Kun apilamädän tuhot yleensä ovat suurimmat ensimmäisen vuoden nurmissa, on niissä saatu myös parhaat torjuntatulokset. Kokeissa on todettu käsittelyllä olevan myös jälkivaikutusta seuraavina vuosina (taulukko 7). Edelleen voitiin havaita torjunnan välillisesti ehkäisevän nurmen rikkaruohottumista, jolla nimenomaan apilan siemenviljelyksillä on huomattava merkitys. PCNB-torjuntamenetelmää voidaan käyttää hyväksi apilan lajike- ja muissa kokeissa apilamädän ja muiden talvehtimista heikentävien tekijöiden toisistaan erottamiseen (taulukot 8—10, kuva 8).",

B-nine, Cycocel ja Phosfon rajoittivat pituuskasvua kaikissa lämpötiloissa, mutta määrällisesti pituuskasvua hillitsevä vaikutus riippui lämpötilasta (taulukko 1 ja 2). Yö- ja päivälämpötilan ollessa 12° C verranne- ja kasvunsääteillä käsiteltyjen kasvien välinen pituusero ei ollut merkitsevä.

Sama voitiin todeta B-ninen ja Cycocelin vaikutuksen määristä silloin, kun yölämpötila oli sama tai alhaisempi kuin päivälämpötila. Jos taas yölämpötila oli korkeampi kuin päivälämpötila, Cycocelin ja yleensä myös B-ninen vaikutuksen määrä heikkeni keskilämpötilan kohotessa (piirros 1). Kasvunsääteiden pituuskasvua rajoittava vaikutus jäi kasvatuskaapeissa vähäisemmäksi kuin luontaisissa valo-oloissa, mihin todennäköisesti oli syynä valo-olojen erilaisuus. Kasvunsääteiden vaikutus taimien tuore- ja kuivapainoon, lehtien kokoon ja painoon oli vähäisempi kuin vaikutus pituuskasvuun, eikä sen ja keskilämpötilan välillä ollut samanlaista korrelaatiota kuin keskilämpötilan ja pituuskasvua rajoittavan vaikutuksen määrän välillä. Sääteiden vaikutus pituuskasvuun ja niiden vaikutus taimien painoon ja lehtien kokoon eivät myöskään olleet selvästi toisistaan riippuvia, joskin Cycocelilla käsiteltyjen taimien tuorepaino oli suhteellisesti pienin samassa lämpötilassa kuin pituus ja B-ninella ja Phosfonilla käsiteltyjen taimien suhteellinen tuorepaino siinä lämpötilassa, jota korkeammissa lämpötiloissa suhteellinen pituus ei enää merkitsevästi pienentynyt.",

The material consists of 115 samples of the undermost leaves from potato plants, 72 clover and 89 timothy samples, together with corresponding soil samples from the top soil of the fields. The dependence of the magnesium content of the potato leaves, clover and timothy yields on the magnesium content of the soil and its saturation percentage, as well as on the ratio between the exchangeable potassium and magnesium on the equivalent basis, were tested by means of linear regression and correlation analyses. The results obtained show that a highly significant positive correlation prevails between the magnesium saturation percentage of the soil and the magnesium content of potato leaves and timothy. Its effect on the magnesium content of clover could not be determined in the present study. As the amount of exchangeable potassium present in the soil increased in relation to the magnesium, the magnesium content of the studied plants significantly decreased. The material collected for the present investigation revealed that in the case of potato leaves, 51 %, and clover and timothy, 34 %, of the total variations in the magnesium content depended on the magnesium saturation percentage and on the ratio K/Mg in the soil. A rise in the potassium saturation percentage significantly reduced the magnesium content of the clover alone, and taking this into account did not significantly raise the explanation percentage of the total variations in the magnesium content of any of the plants.",

    "abstract": "Toimintaverkko on tasoon piirretty projektin havainnollinen malli, jossa on esitetty projektiin kuuluvat tehtävät ja niiden väliset ajalliset riippuvuudet. Toimintaverkkoon voi kuulua myös resurssi- ja/tai kustannuslaskenta. Toimintaverkkomenetelmistä tunnetuimmat, CPM ja PERT kehitettiin Yhdysvalloissa 1950-luvun loppupuolella. Pääasiallinen ero näiden välillä oli se, että CPM käytti tehtävää kohden yhtä kestoajan arviota, mutta PERT kolmea. CPM keskittyi projektin kustannusten minimointiin, PERT sen kehitystyön vaatiman ajan määrittämiseen ja valvontaan. Myöhemmin erot ovat supistuneet vähäisiksi. Toimintaverkkojen laatiminen ja käsinlaskenta esitetään tässä kirjoituksessa hypoteettisen tutkimusprojekti-esimerkin avulla (taulukko 1, kuvat 1 ja 2). Toimintaverkko ilmaisee projektin kriittisen polun. Se käy toimintaverkon läpi sitä tehtäväketjua pitkin, jonka pelivara on pienin; yleensä se on = 0. Kriittistä polkua lyhentämään pyrittäessä myös lähes kriittiset tehtävät tulee ottaa huomioon, koska ne tulevat nopeasti ns. pullonkaulatehtäviksi. Kirjoittaja on käyttänyt Valtion Tietokonekeskuksen PERT C-ohjelmaa tutkiessaan kahta rakennus- ja yhtä salaojitushanketta sekä kevään peltotyömenetelmiä. Viimeksimainitussa (kuva 3) on todettu eri työmenetelmät: kevättyöt erilliskoneita, rivilannoitinta + kylvökonetta, tai yhdistelmäkonetta käyttäen Viikin koetilalla suunnilleen samanveroisiksi töiden joutumisen suhteen. Rivilannoitin-menetelmä on ollut kustannuksiltaan halvin ja yhdistelmäkone-menetelmä kallein. Erilliskoneita käytettäessä mies- ja traktoriresursseja on kuormitettu eniten. Talvella tehty toimintaverkko sääennusteineen on pitänyt hyvin paikkansa töiden alkamisen ja valmistumisen sekä kriittisen polun suhteen. Salaojitus- ja rakennusprojektien (kuva 4, taulukot 2—4) tulostuksien avulla on selvitetty lähinnä resurssien käyttöä ja sovitusta sekä kustannuslaskentaa. Lopuksi on mainittu toimintaverkkomallien soveltuvan simuloinnin ja pelien pohjaksi, joiden yleistymistä rajoittaa tarvittavien perustietojen puute. Nykyiset toimintaverkkomenetelmät soveltuvat hyvin maatalouden työteknisiin tutkimuksiin, joissa käsitellään työvoiman, koneiden ja laitteiden rationaalista käyttöä maatilataloudessa.",

Kaikki kolme kokeissa mukana ollutta kasvunsäädettä hillitsivät pavun taimien pituuskasvua, mutta niiden aiheuttama pituuden lyheneminen riippui kasvualustasta ja yölämpötilasta. B-ninen suhteellinen pituuskasvua rajoittava vaikutus oli suurin hiekassa, Cycocelin turpeessa ja lähes yhtä suuri hiekassa, Phosfonin suurin hiekassa, mutta 2—3 kertaa pienempi turpeessa. Yölämpötilasta aiheutunut taimien suhteellisten pituuksien ero oli suurimmillaan B-nine-käsittelyissä 11, Cycocel-käsittelyissä 13 ja Phosfon-käsittelyissä 23 %-yksikköä. Kasvualustan erilaisuudesta johtuvat erot olivat suurimmillaan vastaavasti 23, 37 ja 60 %- yksikköä. Phosfonin pituuskasvua rajoittava vaikutus oli kaikilla alustoilla suhteellisesti suurin siinä yölämpötilassa, missä vastaavien verrannekasvien kasvu oli voimakkainta. Cycocelin vaikutuksen riippuvuus yölämpötilasta osoitti samanlaista suuntaa, mutta ei yhtä selvästi. B-nine ja Cycocel eivät pienentäneet merkitsevästi lehtipinta-alaa eivätkä taimien tuorepainoa, mutta sen sijaan kuivapaino oli merkitsevästi pienempi verrannekasveihin verrattuna B-ninellä käsitellyissä kasveissa 10° C:ssa hiekassa ja Cycocelilla käsitellyissä kasveissa hiekassa 10° C:ssa ja turpeessa 18° C:ssa. B-nine lisäsi merkitsevästi kuivapainoa turpeessa 18 ja 13 asteessa. Lehtien paino lisääntyi B-nine-käsittelyn vaikutuksesta turpeessa, mutta ei muilla alustoilla. Cycocel ei merkitsevästi muuttanut lehtien osuutta koko painosta. Phosfon rajoitti merkitsevästi lehtien kasvua sekä tuore- ja kuivapainon kasvua hiekassa lämpötilasta riippumatta, mutta lisäsi kuiva-ainepitoisuutta verrannekasveihin verrattuna. Turpeessa Phosfon lisäsi kuivapainoa merkitsevästi lämpötilasta riippumatta.

Data was divided into three groups according to the thyroid weight of the dam: less than 30 g in group I, from 30 to 50 g in group II, and 50 g or over in group III. The following mean values were obtained for the dams and their daughters: thyroid weight in grams: I 24.17 and 21.07, II 38.13 and 24.51, III 61.22 and 31.58; thyroid weight in grams per 100 kg corrected body weight (BRT): I 4.55 and 4.18, II 7.42 and 4.92, III 11.46 and 6.29; absolute amount of epithelial tissue contained per thyroid in grams (Eg); I 4.81 and 4.13, II 5.37 and 4.81, III 6.96 and 5.61; corrected body weight in kg: I 497 and 474, II 507 and 462, III 517 and 489; age in months: I 85.6 and 61.8, II 107.7 and 59.8, III 119,2 and 64.0; mean FCM yield in kg during productional lifetime; I 14.64 and 15.06, II 13.93 and 13.78, III 13.48 and 13.94; FCM yield in kg per 500 kg corrected body weight: I 14.73 and 15.87, II 13.74 and 14.92, III 13.04 and 14.28. The lower thyroid weight in daughters was apparently due to their lower body weight and age as well as to the higher iodine content of the ration. The dam-daughter correlations in respect of the thyroid weight, the BRT, the Eg, the corrected body weight, age, and FCM-yield were: I 0.13, 0.07, 0.27, 0.22, 0.25, and 0.42**, II + III 0.40**, 0.41**, 0.24, 0.07, 0.15, and 0.22, I + II + III 0.47***, 0.49***, 0.30**, 0.13, 0.16, and 0.35***. The results of this study indicate a) that the incidence of goiter was higher in the progeny of goitrous than in that of normal dams, b) that the incidence of goiter in the daughters decreased if the goitrous dam received supplemental iodine during the gestation period from which the daughter was born, c) that a heavier thyroid weight resulted in a lower FCM yield.",

    "abstract": "Tutkimuksessa on monitekijäkokein selvitelty kolmen kevätvehnälajikkeen (Apu, Ruso ja Svenno) viljelyarvoa eri lannoitustasoilla (0, 400 ja 800 kg/ha Yn) sekä lannoitteiden hajalevitystä että rivimultausta käyttäen. Kokeet järjestettiin Tammiston (Helsingin pitäjä) ja Nikkilän (Kangasala) koetiloilla 1966 ja -67. Lannoituksen vaikutus tuli voimakkaammin esiin satotasoltaan heikommissa Nikkilän kokeissa, missä 800 Yn hajalevitettynä antoi 38 prosentin sadonlisäyksen lannoittamattomaan koejäseneen verrattuna. Tammistossa lisäys oli 11 prosenttia. Lannoitteiden rivimultaus lisäsi kevätvehnän lannoitteidenkäyttökykyä niin, että sadot lisääntyivät Nikkilän oloissa 8—15 ja Tammistossa 3—8 prosenttia. Lajikkeiden kyky hyötyä rivimultauksesta oli erilainen. Kun kaikki lajikkeet antoivat hajalevitystä käytettäessä jokseenkin yhtä runsaat sadot, oli rivimultauksella annetun runsaan lannoituksen tasolla Svenno 13 prosenttia Apua satoisampi ja Ruso sijoittui näiden keskivälille. Eri kokeista suoritetut mittaukset ja havainnot osoittivat että rivimultauksella oli positiivinen vaikutus versoston kokoon, versomisen runsauteen, tähkän pituuteen sekä tuleentumisnopeuteen ja sakolukuominaisuuksiin. Kuitenkin useat näistä eroista jäivät varsin pieniksi eivätkä olleet tilastollisesti merkitseviä. Rivimultauksella ei todettu olevan sadon laatuominaisuuksia heikentäviä vaikutuksia. Raakavalkuaispitoisuuden alentuminen oli kokeissa hyvin vähäinen eikä kaikissa koejäsenissä edes yhdensuuntainen. Rivimultaus lisäsi satovarmuutta, sillä riskikertoimet pienenivät verrattuna vastaavin lannoitemäärin tapahtuneeseen hajalevitykseen. Myös lajikkeiden väliset vaateliaisuuserot eliminoituivat käytettäessä rivimultausta, sillä korkeammalla lannoitustasolla muodostuivat vaateliaiksi tunnettujen Svennon ja Ruson riskikertoimet samoiksi kuin Avun, joka puolestaan oli heikommissa koejäsenissä viljelyvarmin. Jalostettaessa lajikkeita voimaperäistä viljelyä varten joudutaan huomiota kiinnittämäänkin tästä syystä lähinnä tekijöihin, jotka mahdollistavat tehokkaan lannoituksen käytön ja leivontakelpoisuudeltaan korkealuokkaisen sadon saannin. Yhdistetyin lajike- ja lannoituskokein on pyrittävä löytämään jalosteet, jotka suhtautuvat edullisimmin voimaperäisen viljelyn oloihin.",

Tutkimuksessa selvitettiin tappioitten suuruutta, umpinaisessa tilassa tapahtuvaa ilman koostumuksen muuttumista ja CO2-pitoisuuden vaikutusta säilyvyyteen.

Herttaässä-salaatin kokonaistappio kaasuvarastossa oli keskimäärin puolta pienempi kuin kylmävarastossa. Great Lakes -salaatilla ei näin suuria eroja havaittu. Kaasuvaraston ilman CO2-pitoisuuden lisääntyessä Herttaässän kokonaistappio pieneni. Great Lakes sen sijaan saattoi muuttaa ilman koostumusta niin paljon, että vioituksia aiheutui.

    "abstract": "Ram circles are used to obtain progeny from sire rams on a number of different farms in order that the effect of farm on progeny may be equalized and, concurrently, the selection of mate be a random one. The objective is the achievement of reliable progeny evaluations of the rams as a result of cooperation between farms. The Finnish experiment covered four farms, and four rams were used to service the four flocks containing a total of 66 ewes. In the spring, 163 lambs were born. In the autumn 40 male lambs were selected from this number at random and were slaughtered, dissected and evaluated. The results were analysed by covariance analysis, and the effects of the dam, the litter and the age of animal were eqalized. The effect of the farm on the early growth and the liveweight of the lambs was considerable, but it decreased with the ageing of the lambs. The effect of farm on the characteristics of the carcass was without significance. The variation between sires was greater than the variation due to error concerning almost all the characteristics, and in four cases the differences were significant at a probability level of 95 per cent. The differences will probably emerge more clearly if the number of farms and the number of rams in the circle are increased. In the experiment this time the number of progeny on the various farms was far from even. On the basis of slaughter results, however, estimates could be produced of the order of superiority of the sires.",

Progeny testing pigs (n = 196) were slaughtered at a weight of c. 90 kg. After conventional carcass evaluation, the carcass half was dissected. The objects of study were the most valuable parts of the half carcass (= ham + carré + back + fore back + shoulder + kidney fat) and its skin+fat and meat+bone components. The possibility of restricting the dissection to the ham and the back was also examined. By means of the least squares methods the following results were obtained: The effect of the slaughter weight on the skin+fat, the meat+bone and the valuable part was very significant. The variation due to age was not significant. The carcass quality on the gilts was better than that of the castrates. By stepwise multiple regression procedures estimations were derived for the skin+fat component, the meat+bone component and the most valuable part of the carcass. By dissection of the ham and the back more information was generally obtained about the slaughter quality of the most valuable part than was obtained by the conventional carcass evaluation. The index (= A/B x A/C x10) was calculated, in which A = weight of the meat+bone component, B = age in days and C = weight of the half carcass. The index correlated with the skin+fat component and its percentage as follows: r = —0.34**– –0.55***, and with the meat+bone component and its percentage: r = 0.77*** —0.78***.

The juices of Atlas were best in quality but they were sensitive to browning while Erstaa juices were not. The juices of Dolgo were considered too tart, but with an exceptionally interesting flavour. Dolgo juices could probably be used in mixtures together with sweeter apple varieties. Ascorbic acid could be used to prevent browning or to stop it to the desired degree and to stabilize the colour of the juice. The second alternative was found to be better because light brownish apple juices are generally preferred. The browning of apple juice was influenced not only by the polyphenolase activity and the polyphenol concentration but also by the type of phenolic compounds.

The following average results were recorded: backfat thickness 21.6 mm (at a live weight of 88 kg), growth rate 699 g/day, feed efficiency 2.69 scand. fu/kg growth and testing score (growth + fat) 99.6. The average testing score for boards selected for A.I. use (43 % of tested) was 99.7. Weakness of the legs was noted in 21 % of the boars. The varying initial weights of the male piglets influenced the growth rate very markedly (P &lt; 0.001), and the effect of the initial age was significant with respect to feed efficiency (P &lt; 0.01). The influence of the weight and age at end of test was highly significant with regard to thickness of fat (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the weight at end of test affected the testing score significantly (P &lt; 0.001), but the effect of age was eliminated by use of correction factors. The years as well as the testing stations influenced most of the results in a significant manner. The thickness of fat for the Yorkshire boars was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.01) than for the Landrace boars and the former also had a significantly lower testing score. The effect of the genetic variation, influence of sires within breeds, was highly significant (P &lt; 0.001) for all test results. It has thus proved possible to estimate the genetic quality of the boars. The different influences on the test results were analyzed by least squares procedures.",

    "abstract": "Seed of the Finnish meadow fescue cultivar Tammisto was grown up to four successive generations at Prosser, Washington and Shafter and Tehachapi, California, USA. Each seed lot was evaluated for its characteristics in Finland by single-plant tests in which the basic seed lot for all the American increases served as standard. Average seed yields ranged from 540 to 660 kg/ha at the three American trial locations. No remarkable significant differences occurred in seed yields as the generation of increase advanced from the first to the fourth. The evaluated trials indicate that there was a substantial stability in the response of the cultivar to the environmental conditions at each seed production location. The greatest changes were found to have occurred in the Shafter lots, whereas those from Prosser and Tehachapi showed minor shifts and resembled each other quite closely. The clearest shifts occurred in the rate of development. All lots showed an increase in the proportion of plants headed in the first season, and in the second season they likewise became headed earlier than the Finnish basic lot. The shift towards earliness took place mostly in the first generation, although a continuing shift towards earlier average date of heading was still observed in the third generation. The two characteristics indicating heading were highly significantly correlated with each other but not with any of the six other characteristics observed. Seed from all the three American experimental locations gave rise to populations with noticeably reduced proportions of prostrate-growing plants. This change usually took place during the first generation of increase. The third and fourth-generation lots from Prosser and Shafter overwintered distinctly less well than the first and second-generation or basic seed lots. In other characteristics shifts were minor or non-existent. Within the material from each seed production location evaluation trials showed positive correlations between each of the following characteristics: winter survival, number of stalks/plant (2nd year), plant height and fresh weight. Partial correlations calculated from the entire US material showed that winter survival and fresh weight were positively correlated with stalk number and plant height; between the two latter characteristics there was a significant negative correlation. Forage production trials revealed no differences between the lots in terms of total forage yield and winter survival, not even after three to four generations of seed increase in the USA.",

    "abstract": "Technical development in animal production, as in agricultural production in general has a twofold function. The first is to substitute capital for human labour, and the second is to gain a higher yield per animal unit. Especially in animal production carried on with hired labour, the production factor capital is substituting the production factor labour at an accelerated rate. In animal husbandry the capital investment in relation to the labour input on modern family farms is, on an average, less than the capital investment in crop husbandry. At the same time it appears also that on the smaller farms the compared values lie closer to each other, while increasing size of farms leads to a much greater increase of capital investment in crop husbandry than in animal husbandry. The need of capital occurs for two different purposes: for investments and circulating capital. The need of circulating capital in relation to the amount of sales (gross return) is 21/2 times greater in milk and beef production than in pork or egg production. In relation to the need of investment capital the demand for circulating capital is particularly great in beef and pork production. The high demand for circulating capital in pork production in relation to the labour input is connected with, among others, the continuous need of large replacements. At a given labour input the capital investment in relation to sales is considerably higher in milk production than in pork production, while egg production occupies an intermediate position.",

    "abstract": "Tutkimuksessa tarkasteltiin viljelytekniikan vaikutusta nurmen talvehtimiseen ja S. borealis-sienen esiintymisrunsauteen Helsingin yliopiston koetilalla Inarin Muddusniemessä vuosina 1957—65. Kesäkuulla tai heinäkuun alkupuolella kylvetty nurmi talvehti parhaiten ja antoi suurimmat kuiva-ainesadot. Elokuulla kylvetyssä nurmessa esiintyi runsaasti S. borealista ja sen sato jäi alhaiseksi. Oraiden kehittymisen kannalta epäedullisissa sääolosuhteissa suojaviljan käyttö paransi S. borealis-sienelle alttiiden heinälajien talvehtimista ja satoa 1957/58. Oraiden typpilannoitus nopeutti timoteinurmen kehittymistä ja vähensi S. borealisen aiheuttamia vaurioita sekä kohotti 1. vuoden heinäsatoa. Paras vaikutus sillä oli myöhään kylvetyllä nurmella. Suotuisissa kasvuolosuhteissa 1961 runsas typpilannoitus rehevöitti aikaisin kylvettyjä oraita liikaa ja lisäsi lumihomeen (F. nivale) esiintymistä. Kvintotseenikäsittely paransi ratkaisevasti nurmen talvehtimista. Silloin kun S. borealista esiintyi erittäin runsaasti, kuten 1960/61 kvintotseeni ei täysin suojannut timoteikasvustoja, vaan esim. kylvöaikojen väliset talvehtimiserot olivat edelleen nähtävissä. Samoin 1956/57 eri heinälajien väliset kestävyyserot olivat havaittavissa kvintotseenikäsittelystä huolimatta. Fungisidikäsittely antoi merkitsevän sadonlisäyksen vielä 2. vuoden timoteinurmessa vuonna 1965.",

    "abstract": "Ham quality and its relationship to carcass quality were investigated in Landrace and Yorkshire pigs at the Puistola (n = 97) and Pohjanmaa (n = 103) litter testing stations by means of specific weight of the ham and dissection analysis of the ham and the most valuable part of the carcass. The material was processed by means of factor analysis. The greatest loading in the first factor was acquired by the fat-% of the ham (0.93), the second greatest by the meat-% of the ham (—0.90), the third greatest by the skin + fat part of the ham (0.89), and the fourth by the percentage of the skin + fat component of the most valuable part of the carcass (0.82). The skin + fat part of the ham correlated very significantly with the skin + fat component of the most valuable part of the carcass (Puistola r = 0.76, Pohjanmaa r = 0.74), and meat + bone part of the ham with the meat + bone component of the most valuable part of the carcass (Puistola r = 0.83, Pohjanmaa r = 0.81). In the Pohjanmaa material (n = 99) the phenotypical and genotypical correlations of the ham, back and their components with the carcass and its equivalent components were found to be relatively uniform. The only exception was the correlation of the meat + bone of the ham with the meat + bone of the most valuable part of the carcass (rphen. = 0.83, rgen. = 0.48). No significant phenotypical or genotypical correlation was found between the skin + fat of the ham and meat + bone of the ham.",

Viljahehtaaria kohden lasketun ihmis-, hevos-, traktori- ja puimurityönmenekin lisäksi muuttujina ovat hehtaari-sato, vilja-ala, rukiin plus rypsin osuus vilja-alasta ja tilan muunnettu ala. Varianssianalyyseillä ja t-testeillä on tarkasteltu muuttujista tilojen ja vuosien välisen eron voimakkuutta. Merkitseviä eroja on todettu tilojen välillä kaikkien muuttujien suhteen ja vuosien välillä työnmenekkilukujen suhteenvetopuimurin käyttöä lukuunottamatta. Ihmis- ja hevostyön sekä ajopuimurin käytössä vuosien välinen vaihtelu on ollut yli kaksinkertainen tilojen väliseen vaihteluun verrattuna, mutta toisten muuttujien kohdalla tilojen välinen vaihtelu on ollut vuosien välistä suurempi. Ihmistyönmenekin paras selittäjä on ollut hevostyö sekä tilaryhmälle kokonaisuudessaan että eri tiloille ja eri tutkimusvuosina. Selitysaste on ollut pelkästään sitä käyttäen 0.7—0.9. Eri yhtälöissä ovat esiintyneet vetopuimurin käyttöä lukuunottamatta muutkin muuttujat tilastollisesti merkitsevinä selittäjinä. Hevostyönmenekin paras selittäjä on vastavuoroisesti ollut ihmistyö, mutta kaikki muutkin muuttujat ovat olleet yhdessä tai useammassa yhtälössä merkitsevinä selittäjinä. Traktorityönmenekille hevostyö on ollut yleisimmin esiintynyt selittäjä, mutta muitakin on ollut usein. Regressioyhtälöiden selitysasteet ovat olleet yleensä korkeahkoja, samoin yhtälöiden F-arvot havaintojen vähyydestä huolimatta. Interkorrelaatioiden takia regressiokertoimia ei ole yleensä voitu tarkastella toisistaan riippumattomina. Kuitenkin on pääteltävissä, että hevostyönmenekin muuttuessa tunnilla ihmistyönmenekki on muuttunut samaan suuntaan noin 2.5 tuntia.",

For this purpose the phenotypic, genetic and intra-sire correlation matrix as well as stepwise multiple regression analyses were calculated by computer for the material of 138 boars. The results showed that there was a very strong correlation between fat thickness and testing score (rG = —0.95***, rP = —0.88***). Of the total variation in the testing score 85.2 % was accounted for by the variation in fat thickness. Although the testing score is made up of the points for fat thickness and growth, the latter accounted for only 9.2 % of the variation in the score. Daily growth was positively associated with the testing score and negatively with the amount of feed units required per growth kilogram, but significantly so only for the intra-sire correlations; the genetic correlations being even, contrary to expectation. The association between growth rate and fat thickness was positive (rG = 0.47***). Of the total variation in feed efficiency the testing score accounted for 35.6 %. A high testing score was associated with a favourable feed efficiency (rg = —0.63***). By correlation studies attempts were also made to find out whether it would be possible to shorten the testing period without decreasing the accuracy. The correlations show that the growth rate can be predicted with an appreciable degree of accuracy already from the weight at the 8th testing week. The correlations between the above weight and growth rates were; rG = 0.84***, rP = 0.82***. From the associations between different characteristics one can decide on the suitability of testing and the consequences of selection for particular traits.",

    "abstract": "Tutkimuksessa haluttiin selvittää, kuinka paljon ja millaisia peltoviljelykoneita eri kokoisilla tiloilla käytetään, kuinka kauan konetta pidetään ja miksi se poistetaan käytöstä, sekä millainen on ollut kehitys näiden seikkojen suhteen 1960-luvulla. Tutkimuskoneina olivat traktoriaura, lannoitteen levitin ja niittokone. Aineisto kerättiin koko maasta tilakäynnein samoilta tiloilta vuosina 1959, 1964 ja 1969. Tutkimustiloja oli 83 kpl, muunnetun maatalousmaan alaltaan v. 1959 10—50 ha. Ne eivät muodostaneet määrättyä otosta. Tuloksia: Käytettävät aurakoot suurenivat tutkimuskaudella, ja suuremmilla tiloilla käytettiin suurempia auroja kuin pienillä. Rivilannoitin yleistyi nopeasti tutkimuskauden lopulla yli 20 peltohehtaarin tiloilla. Niittokoneet olivat samanlaisia eri kokoisilla tiloilla. Suuremmat tilat hankkivat nopeammin uusien työmenetelmien edellyttämiä koneita kuin pienemmät, ja suurilla niille tuli runsaasti käyttöä. Muuten koneen iällä sinänsä ei ollut vaikutusta vuotuiseen käyttömäärään, eikä suuremmilla tiloilla ollut yleensä uudempia koneita kuin pienemmillä. Hehtaareissa laskien auran ja levittimen käyttömäärät lisääntyivät, niittokoneen supistui. Levittimen ja niittokoneen käyttötuntimäärät vähenivät traktorikoneiden yleistyessä. V. 1969 koneiden keskimääräinen käyttö oli: Traktoriaura 76 tuntia/v 24.2 ha/v, Lannoitteen levitin 43 » 32.7 », Niittokone 21 » 11.1 ». Auran ja levittimen käyttömäärien ja tilan peltoalan välillä oli vahva positiivinen korrelaatio. Tutkimustiloilla käytössäolleiden koneiden keskimääräiset iät olivat: 1959 1964 1969 Traktoriaura 5.4 v 5.9 v 5.9 v, Lannoitteen levitin 7.6 » 9.2 » 6.5 », Niittokone 6.5 » 8.3 » 8.2 ». Levittimien ja niittokoneiden keski-ikää kohottivat aineistossa mukanaolleet hevoskoneet; traktorikoneet olivat aurojen ikäisiä. Keskihajonta niin ikien kuin käyttömäärienkin suhteen oli suuri. V. 1969 arvioitiin käytössä oleville koneille 2—4 vuotta lyhyemmät jäljellä olevat kestoajat kuin samanikäisille koneille v. 1959. Keskimääräiset käytöstä poistamisiät olivat: aurat 8—10 v, hevoslevittimet 14—16 v, traktorilevittimet 7—9 v, hevosniittokoneet n. 20 v ja traktoriniittokoneet 5—7 v. Poistamisikien hajonta oli erittäin suuri. Hevoskoneiden käytöstä poistamisen pääsyy oli traktorikoneisiin siirtyminen. Hevoskoneista useimmat romutettiin heti tai myöhemmin. Traktorikoneet poistettiin lähinnä traktorin vaihdon, koneen heikkouden tai sopimattomuuden tai mallin vanhentuneisuuden takia. Loppuunkuluneita oli poistetuista auroista ja niittokoneista vain aniharva, levittimistä useampia. Traktorikoneet myytiin tavallisesti käyttökoneeksi. Koneet poistettiin käytöstä yleensä ennen odotetun kestoajan päättymistä ja ilmeisesti myös arvioitua aikaisemmin. Kustannus- ym. konelaskelmissa voidaan käyttää normilukujen ja käyttöpinta-alojen perusteella laskettavia vuotuisia käyttötuntimääriä. Mallien vanhentumisen takia yli 10 vuoden kestoikiä ei suositella käytettäväksi laskelmissa peltoviljelykoneille.",

Kokeissa olivat varhaisperunalajikkeina Dore, Ersteling, Ostara, Siikli, Sirtema ja Tanja sekä talviperunalajikkeina Alfa, Bintje, Milva, Patrones, Realta, Rekord ja Tombola. Laadun kriteerinä on pidetty ominaispainoa, makua, jauhoisuutta, moitteettoman ruokaperunan määrää, keitonjälkeistä tummumista ja rikkikiehumista (ELLALA ym. 1971). Moitteettoman ruokaperunan osuus vaihteli eri lajikkeilla 0—98 %. Moitteettoman ruokaperunan määrä sadosta vaihteli 0—28 tn/ha. Lannoituksen ominaispainoa alentava vaikutus ilmeni kaikilla lajikkeilla moitteettoman ruokaperunan prosentuaalisen osuuden alenemisena. Moitteettoman ruokaperunan sadon määrä (tn/ha) oli varhaisperunalajikkeilla Sirtemaa lukuunottamatta suurempi voimakkaalla lannoituksella kuin normaalilla. Talviperunalajikkeilla ei lannoituksen aiheuttama sadon lisäys kompensoinut lannoituksen ominaispainoa alentavaa vaikutusta, joten niistä saatiin normaalilla lannoituksella enemmän moitteetonta ruokaperunaa kuin voimakkaalla lannoituksella. Rikkikiehumista esiintyi haitallisessa määrin ainoastaan Milvassa, jossa hajoaminen oli niin voimakasta, että se rajoittanee k.o. lajikkeen käyttöä ruokaperunana. Sen sijaan lajike voi olla käyttökelpoinen jalosteisiin, joissa korkea kuiva-ainepitoisuus on eduksi ja joissa rikkikiehuminen ei ole esteenä. Perunat säilyivät 0.25 %:sella NaHSO3-liuoksella käsittelyn jälkeen 1—5 vrk tummumattomina lajikkeesta riippuen. Lannoituksen todettiin aiheuttavan makueroa vain kahteen varhaisperunalajikkeeseen (Siikli, Tanja) ja kahteen talviperunalajikkeeseen (Realta, Patrones). Muilla lajikkeilla makueroa ei triangelitestiä käyttäen todettu.",

    "abstract": "Verinäytteet kerättiin huhti-toukokuun vaihteessa kolmen eri ratsutallin 5 varsasta ja 63 hevosesta. I-tallin hevoset olivat pääasiassa Puolasta tuotettuja, II-tallin Suomessa syntyneitä ja III-tallin Tanskasta tuotettuja. Verinäytteistä määritettiin Hb-, Hc- ja glukoosi sekä seerumin kolesteroli, Ca-, Mg-, epäorg. P-, K-, Na-, Fe-, Cu- ja Zn-pitoisuudet. Tutkimuksessa löydettiin eroja eri talleissa pidettyjen ja eri ikäisten hevosten veren koostumuksessa. I-tallin hevosilla Hc-, Ca-, Mg-, K- ja Fe-arvot olivat keskimäärin korkeimmat mutta P- ja Na-arvot alhaisimmat; II-tallin hevosilla keskimääräinen veren glukoosi-arvo oli korkein mutta Hc-, Cu- ja Zn-arvot alhaisimmat; III-tallin hevosilla P-, Na-, Cu- ja Zn-pitoisuudet olivat keskimäärin korkeimmat mutta Hb-, kolesteroli-, Ca-, Mg-, K- ja Fe-arvot alhaisimmat. Tutkimustulosten tarkastelun yhteydessä kävi ilmi, että eri talleissa pidettyjen hevosten veriseerumin Ca-, Mg-, K-, Cu- ja Zn-pitoisuuksissa havaitut erot saattavat johtua rehuannoksen kivennäis- ja hivenainemäärissä ilmenneistä eroista. Nuorten hevosten ikäluokissa veren glukoosi-, Ca-, P- ja K-pitoisuudet olivat keskimäärin korkeimmat, mutta Mg-, Na-, Fe-, Cu- ja Zn-pitoisuudet alhaisimmat. 7—12 vuotiaille keskimääräiset Hb-, Hc-, kolesteroli-, Mg- ja Zn-arvot olivat korkeimmat mutta glukoosi- ja P-pitoisuudet alhaisimmat. Yli 12-vuotiailla veriseerumin Cu-pitoisuus oli korkein mutta Ca- ja K-pitoisuudet alhaisimmat.",

    "abstract": "In 1971 two large field experiments, one for spring wheat and the other for barley, were carried out on silty clay soil in southern Finland. Three sowing methods were compared at three sowing rate levels (wheat: 140, 275 or 400 kg/ha, barley: 100, 200 or 300 kg/ha), at two levels of rolling (not rolled or rolled by a Cambridge-roller, 330 kg/m), and at two levels of irrigation (not irrigated or irrigated twice in June, 30 mm at both times). Wheat produced 9 ± 2 % higher grain yields sown with a 12.5 cm spacing between coulters in 7 cm bands than in rows of 2 cm. The increases in yield were almost equal irrespective of the seeding rate, rolling or irrigation. The sowing methods had no noteworthy influence on the ripening or the weight of the wheat grains. Barley responded to the sowing methods to a lesser extent than did wheat. Bands 7 cm wide with 12.5 cm spacing resulted in 5 ± 2 % higher wheat yields and 2 ± 1 % higher barley yields than did bands 10 cm wide with 25 cm spacing. The results indicate that the band method with relatively small spacings between the bands is worth further and more detailed study. An increase in the seeding rate from low to »normal» increased the yields, speeded up ripening and decreased the weight of grains, but when normal seeding rates were exceeded the grain yields were not further improved. Rolling speeded up ripening but did not significantly increase the grain yields. Of the factors included in the study, the sprinkler irrigation affected the yields most by increasing the grain yields of wheat by 23 ± 22 % and those of barley by 29 ± 9 %.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the light source (high-pressure vapor lamps (HPS), light-emitting diodes (LED), or a combination) and their distribution in time on growth and coloration of red winter lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. ‘Carmoli’). The used energy associated to each of the light treatments was also evaluated. The number of leaves, fresh and dry weight were significantly higher for plants treated only with HPS lights, whereas the red pigmentation was enhanced in plants grown only under LEDs. The lower yield under LEDs was associated with a significantly lower leaf temperature compared to plants grown under HPS lights. One week at the end of the growth period under LEDs was enough to achieve a satisfactory red color, while not compromising plant yield. The energy use efficiency was increased by nearly 50% in the LED-only treatment despite the lower plant yield compared to the HPS-only treatment. These results demonstrate that supplemental light quality can be strategically used by improving the light source position in exposure sequence to enhance the growth and coloration of winter lettuce.",

It has a higher concentration of soluble carbohydrate than lucerne and its protein is less degradable in the rumen than lucerne protein. The aim of this study was to quantify the main crude protein (CP) and carbohydrate (CHO) fractions of a tetraploid (4n, cv K-32) and a diploid (2n, cv K-39) red clover cultivar harvested at three stages of development in the spring growth. Results showed that the cultivar and stage of development had a large impact on chemical composition and the protein and carbohydrate fractions determined by the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS). The rapidly degradable protein fraction (PA) was significantly higher in the tetraploid (272 to 287 g kg-1 CP with advancing plant development) than in the diploid red clover cultivar (214 to 268 g kg-1 CP). Rumen degradable carbohydrate concentration was not affected by cultivar but it was significantly influenced by the stage of development. The concentration of rumen degradable protein decreased from 726 to 655 g kg-1 CP with advancing plant development in the diploid red clover cultivar. In conclusion, the tetraploid red clover cultivar was higher in CP, its protein was more rapidly degradable, and it was characterized by lower concentrations of lignin and unavailable carbohydrate fractions than the diploid cultivar.",

    "abstract": "Cold soils and a short boreal growing season are assumed to necessitate high soil phosphorus (P) status and ample P applications to vegetable crops. Yet, a previous Finnish study indicated lower than anticipated yield responses of onion and cabbage. Here we report 2-year P trials with iceberg lettuce (cv. Skindel) transplanted in an open field in spring and midsummer on a clay soil with moderately low P status. During the spring plantings, P concentration in soil solution was followed using Plant Root Simulator (PRS) probes in P0 (0 kg P ha-1) and P60 (60 kg P ha-1) treatments. The PRS probes indicated initially 5 to 7-fold higher soil solution P concentration in the P60 treatment compared to P0 due to fertilisation, but thereafter P concentrations equalised. For spring plantings, P applications did not explain yield variation, giving statistically non-significant, maximum 14% higher yields over P0. In summer plantings, about 30% of the yield variation was explained by P applications, and the P60 rate gave 20–35% higher yields over P0. Mitscherlich type model integrating all data predicted a maximum 20% yield, 10% of the variation being accounted for. The model suggested that 32 kg P ha-1 brings 97% of the maximum yield, whilst the Finnish P fertilisation regulation allows 60 kg ha-1 for the given soil. No correlation between P applications and P concentrations of lettuce leaves was found. The results stress the need for empirical evaluation of P requirements of vegetable crops to avoid unnecessary P applications.",

The aim of the study was to develop an easy to implement protocol in order to compare the aerobic stability of different feed mixtures for lactating dairy cattle and to test the potential of TMR stabilizing products to delay spoilage. The experimental conditions were standardized to 25 °C ambient, and the sample dry matter was adjusted to 400 g kg-1 to challenge shelf life. Temperature rise in an insulated vessel, which is frequently used when testing silages, was shown to be one promising indicator of spoilage activity. Furthermore, determination of pH, scores for visual occurrence of yeasts and moulds and condensation from 0–4 were successfully applied at the end of the 72 h period. A dosage of 4.5 l propionic acid t-1 proved suitable as a positive control when compared to 1.5 and 3.0 l t-1. The commercial products tested at the recommended dose had a similar efficacy. The stabilizing effect depended principally on the original hygienic condition of the ration. Visual evaluation plus the recording of pH, in addition to continuous temperature measurement facilitated this appraisal. Early signs of spoilage, in particular, can only be assessed by visual appraisal. Thus, an evaluation of a combination of indicators of aerobic stability is recommended.",

However, the production of small household plots is significant with respect to certain farm products. Thus, 65 per cent of the eggs, 43—46 per cent of the wine, 33—35 per cent of the milk, 30—33 per cent of the slaughtered cattle, 29 per cent of the fruits and 13—15 per cent of the slaughtered pigs come from small privately farmed plots. The efficiency of Hungarian agriculture has developed rapidly since the early 1960s. This is reflected in the increase of average per hectare yields. In the late 1960s two substantial price rises occurred in agriculture. Experience since then shows that with the introduction of the reform and with the rise in the price level the role and scope of prices has become greater and wider. Nowadays it is believed that it is possible to manage farms successfully without compulsory plan directions using more economic regulators instead.",

Fertilizers were used with and without boron. The boron, from 0.9 to 2.8 B kg/ha, was applied mainly as fertilizer borate and was mixed into the soil during seed bed preparation. The size of yield when boron was not applied did not depend significantly on the pH, calcium, phosphorus or boron content of the soils. The difference in yield obtained with boron fertilization varied from —520 to + 580 kg/ha. Hot water-soluble boron in the soil, and the joint effect of this and acid ammonium acetate-extractable calcium gave the best correlation with the yield differences. It appears that it is possible to improve the test value of hot water-soluble boron by taking into account the type of soil and its calcium content.",

    "abstract": "Kevättalvella 1969 järjestettiin Hankkijan kasvinjalostuslaitoksella Perunaseuran alaisen Perunapakkausten kehittämistoimikunnan toimesta tutkimus, jossa selvitettiin perunan säilymistä ja laadun muutoksia kolmesta paperilaadusta (Clupak, märkäluja ja voimapaperi) ja kahdesta polyeteenilaadusta (mustapigmentoitu mikrorei’itetty ja läpinäkyvä rei’itetty) tehdyissä 2.5 ja 5 kg:n pakkauksissa varasto-, kauppa- ja kotisäilytyksen aikana. Tämän tutkimuksen tulokset voidaan tiivistää seuraaviin johtopäätöksiin: Perunoiden painohäviö vähittäiskaupan pakkauksissa vaihteli pakkausmateriaalin mukaan. Se oli suurin paperipusseissa, joissa se yhden viikon varastosäilytyksen aikana nousi keskimäärin 1.2 %:iin, sitä seuranneena kahden viikon kauppasäilytyksen aikana 5.4 %:iin sekä sen jälkeen kotisäilytyksessä jopa 7.3 %:iin. Polyeteenipusseissa painohäviö oli huomattavasti pienempi: 0.5—2.2—4.2 %. 5 kg:n polyeteenipusseissa painohäviö oli pienempi kuin 2.5 kg:n pusseissa. Perunoiden kostuminen oli harvareikäisissä polyeteenipusseissa niin nopeaa, että jo yhden viikon varastosäilytyksen jälkeen 69 % perunoista oli märkiä. Myös mikrorei’itetyissa isoissa polyeteenipusseissa kostui yli 40 % perunoista yhden viikon aikana. Paperipusseissa perunat säilyivät moitteettoman kuivina koko kokeen ajan. Perunoiden itäminen oli nopeinta polyeteenipusseissa sekä märkälujasta voimapaperista tehdyissä pusseissa. Käytetyt pakkausmateriaalit vaikuttivat hyvin eri tavalla perunoiden vihertymiseen. Vihertyminen oli vähäisintä mustapigmentoiduissa polyeteenipusseissa, joissa vihertyneitä mukuloita yhden viikon varastosäilytyksen ja kahden viikon vähittäiskauppasäilytyksen jälkeen oli vain 0.5 %. Paperilaaduista tavallinen voimapaperi oli muita huonompi (57 %, muut paperilaadut keskimäärin 33 %). Selvästi epäedullisin oli läpinäkyvä polyeteeni (91 %). Perunoiden pilaantuminen noudatti selvästi kostumistuloksia. Se oli vähäistä paperipusseissa, selvästi runsaampaa mikrorei’itetyissä isoissa polyeteenipusseissa sekä ylivoimaisesti runsainta läpinäkyvissä harvareikäisissä polyeteenipusseissa. Perunoiden jauhoisuudessa ei ollut selviä eroja pakkausmateriaalien välillä. Pienissä pusseissa jauhoisuus oli hiukan parempi kuin isoissa. Jauhoisuus aleni kokeen aikana. Kuorittuina keitettyjen perunoiden maku huononi kokeen kuluessa. Merkitseviä eroja ei todettu materiaalien eikä pakkauskokojen vaikutusten välillä, joskin läpinäkyvään polyeteeniin pakatut perunat saivat muita huonompia arvosanoja.",

Today we generally place fertilizer and drill seed at the same time with a fertilizer placement drill, which drills seed to rows and places fertilizer between every other row. We also use machines, fertilizer and seed drills, with which the sowing and the fertilizer placement are done with the same coulters in different operations. Shares of the drill coulters can also be turnable so that one end is a fertilizer coulter and the other a seed coulter. The sale of fertilizer placement drills is at present about 10 times larger than the total sale of traditional seed drills in Finland. There have been many field experiments in the placement of fertilizer with spring cereals in Finland. The placement of fertilizer into a depth of 8—10 cm has increased grain yields of spring cereals on an average about 14 percent. The increase in grain yields has varied between 0—40 % in different yers. The placement of fertilizer has improved most the availability of nitrogen, next of potassium and then of phosphorus. The placement has also accelerated ripening. The crude protein content of the grain yield has decreased somewhat by the placement of fertilizer. Sprinkler irrigation did not appear to reduce the effect of placement of the fertilizer. These two methods form a highly efficient combination.",

Kokeet jatkuivat keskimäärin noin 6 vuotta. Pääosan koekasveista muodostivat heinäksi korjattu nurmi, kaura ja ohra.

Fosfori- ja kalilannoitus olivat molemmissa kokeissa jokseenkin yhtä suuret ja typpeen nähden riittävät, mutta tässä selostetuissa kokeissa oli typpilannoitus (36 kg/ha N) suurempi kuin fosfaattilannoitus-kalkituskokeissa (28 kg/ha N). Kolmessa 16—18 vuotta jatkuneessa kokeessa kauran ja heinän satotaso aluksi jopa laski, mutta nousi myöhemmin jokseenkin samassa suhteessa kuin typpilannoitus.

    "abstract": "Tutkimuksen tarkoituksena on ollut maatalouden rakennerationalisoinnin liiketaloudellisten edellytyksien selvittäminen lähinnä Uudenmaan ruotsinkielisen maanviljelysseuran alueella. Erisuuruisten yritysmallien kannattavuutta on tutkittu vertailevan staattisen analyysin avulla. Mallien ratkaisemiseksi on käytetty erästä Monte Carlo -menetelmän muunnelmaa. Rajoittavana tekijänä on malleissa ollut kolme vaihtoehtoista työpanosta, nimittäin 2500 t, 5000 t ja7500 t työvuotta kohti. Tämän lisäksi on tutkittu kahta tuotantoteknistä tasoa. Jo kirjoittajan aikaisempien tutkimusten perusteella on voitu todeta, että tutkimusalueen viljelijät varsin yleisesti soveltavat malleissa käytettyä alempaa tuotantotekniikkaa. Ainoastaan muutamat harvat viljelijät käyttävät tällä hetkellä malleissa esitettyä ylempää tuotantotekniikkaa. Muut malleissa edellytetyt tuotannontekijät ovat vapaasti saatavana normaalia korvausta vastaan. Sekä tuotteiden että tarvikkeiden hinnat on sovitettu tutkimusalueella syksyllä 1973 vallinneeseen hintatasoon. Pellon vuokraksi on malleissa oletettu 300 mk hehtaarilta. Malliratkaisut osoittivat, että erikoistunut maidontuotanto on kannattavin tuotantosuunta. Erikoistuminen on tässä mallissa viety hyvin pitkälle, koska malliyrityksen tarvitsema rehuvilja ostetaan melkein kokonaan ja ainoastaan nurmirehu tuotetaan omalla tilalla. Erikoistunut maidontuotanto antaa selvästi paremman korvauksen työlle kuin erikoistunut viljantuotanto. Tämä pätee molemmilla teknisillä tasoilla ja kaikenkokoisissa yrityksissä. Työansio paranee malliratkaisujen mukaan siirryttäessä pienemmästä yrityksestä suurempaan. Paraneminen on kuitenkin ratkaisevasti suurempi siirryttäessä pienimmästä yrityskoosta keskisuureen kuin siirryttäessä keskisuuresta suurimpaan yrityskokoon. Pienin yrityskoko molemmilla teknisillä tasoilla antaa viljanviljelytiloilla negatiivisen työansion. Työansio paranee myös merkittävästi siirryttäessä korkeammalle tuotantotekniselle tasolle. Pääoman tarve on kaikissa mallivaihtoehdoissa hyvin suuri ja se kasvaa myös siirryttäessä alemmalta tuotantotekniseltä tasolta korkeammalle. Merkittävä rakennerationalisointi vaatii siis suuria investointeja. Voidaankin epäillä, löytyykö rahamarkkinoilta tarpeeksi varoja, kun otetaan huomioon kyseisten investointikohteiden suhteellisen heikko kannattavuus. Merkittävät rationalisointimuutokset vaativat yrityksen johtajalta paljon myös maataloudessa, missä yrittäjä johtamistyönlisäksi useimmiten joutuu tekemään pääosan myös ruumiillisesta työstä. Tarvittavan yrittäjäkapasiteetin löytäminen voi näin ollen muodostua vaikeaksi. Tilamalleissa edellytetyt rakenteelliset muutokset ovat varsin laajoja. Tulosten mukaan voidaan epäillä, tapahtuuko näin suuria muutoksia käytännössä kovinkaan usein yksittäisillä maatiloilla. Tutkimuksessa käytetty vertaileva staattinen tarkastelutapa edellyttää, että laajuusasteelta toiselle siirtymisen välillä vallitsee staattisia kausia, jolloin kannattavuus mitataan. Koska siirtyminen vie aikaa mm. sen takia, ettei useinkaan voida välittömästi ottaa käyttöön investoinneilla luotua tuotannon lisäkapasiteettia, tulee yrityksen maksuvalmiuden ylläpitäminen sitä tärkeämmäksi, mitä suuremmaksi lainapääoman osuus koko pääomapanoksesta kasvaa. Malliyritysten rahavirtoja on tutkimuksessa seurattu simuloimalla viiden vuodenpituisen jakson ajan. Tuloksista voidaan todeta, että siirtyminen korkeimmalle tuotantotekniselle tasolle rasittaa maksuvalmiutta suhteellisesti enemmän kuin siirtyminen keskikorkealle tasolle. Yleisesti ottaen ylimenokauden vaikeudet vaarantavat suhteellisen helposti malliyritysten maksuvalmiutta. Erikostuneen maidontuotannon mallit tuntuvat sietävän jonkin verran suurempaa lainapääoman osuutta kuin erikoistuneen viljanviljelyn mallit. Maksuvalmiusvaikeudet muodostuvat yleensä kriittisiksi viimeistään, kun lainapääomanosuus malleissa on noin 50 % koko pääomasta. Laskelmat on suoritettu keskivuosilaskelmina edellyttäen täydellistä varmuutta. Riskitekijät vaikuttavat näin ollen ensisijaisesti malliyritysten maksuvalmiuteen.",

Mm. seuraavat johtopäätökset näyttivät oikeutetuilta: 1) Useimpien maidon ainesosien pitoisuuksissa esiintyy selvää vaihtelua. Rasva-%:n muuntelu on noin 1.7 kertaa laajempaa kuin valkuais-%:n (Taul. 1.). 2) Rotujen välillä on huomattavia eroja. Roduilla, joilla on korkea rasva- %, on myös keskimääräistä korkeampi valkuais-%, rasvattoman kuiva-aineen % ja kokonaiskuiva-aine-%, mutta niiden valkuais/rasvasuhde on alhainen (Taul. 2.). 3) Pitoisuuksien toistuvuudet ovat suhteellisen suuria, 60—7O %, niin että yhden vuoden määritykset riittävät yksilöiden arvosteluun (Taul. 3.). 4) Useimpien pitoisuuksien samoin kuin valkuais/rasva-suhteenkin periytymisasteet ovat noin 50 %, mikä tekee yksilövalinnan mahdolliseksi (Taul. 4.). 5) Maitotuotoksen ja tärkeitten ainesosien pitoisuuksien välillä on sekä ilmiasuisesti että perinnöllisesti ilmeinen antagonismi (Taul. 5.). 6) Pitoisuuksien keskinäiset ilmiasuiset vuorosuhteet ovat useimmissa tapauksissa myönteisiä (Taul. 6.). 7) Tuotosten kuten myös pitoisuuksien keskinäiset perinnölliset vuorosuhteet ovat hyvin kiinteitä ja myönteisiä. Tuotosten ja pitoisuuksien väliset perinnölliset vuorosuhteet ovat löyhiä ja eräissä tapauksissa jopa kielteisiä. Korkea valkuais/rasva-suhde on antagonistinen suurille rasvan tai kokonaiskuiva-aineen tuotoksille (Taul. 7.). 8) Väkevyyteen perustuva valinta johtaa maitotuotosten alenemiseen ja sen seurauksena heikkoon edistymiseen ko. ainesosan tuotoksessa. Valinta on siten perustettava tuotoksiin, ja pitoisuuksien määrittämisen tarkoituksena on voida arvioida nämä tuotokset. Paras edistyminen tietyn ainesosan tuotoksen suhteen voidaan saavuttaa sen suoralla valinnalla. Valkuaistuotosvalinta parantaa vähitellen myös valkuais/ rasva-suhdetta. Lähes täydellinen teho voidaan saavuttaa valitsemalla vain sonnit valkuaistuotosten perusteella ja lehmät vain maitotuotosten perusteella (Taul. 8.).",

Käytetty pieni määrä, 50 kg/ha N, oli edullisinta antaa keväällä, kun taas 100 kg/ha N antoi parhaan tuloksen myöhään syksyllä käytettynä. Keväällä annettu 100 kg.n typpiannos osoittautui kerta-annoksena haitallisen suureksi. Sen jakaminen kahteen levityskertaan oli edullista. 150 kg;n typpiannoksen käyttö oli edullista vain, kun peruslannoituksena oli käytetty 100 kg/ha N syksyllä ja loppu 50 kg tähkimisen alussa. Suuret kerta-annokset typpeä alensivat hl-painoa. 1000 jp:ssa ei ollut merkitseviä eroja. Sakoluvuissa ei ollut typpilannoituksesta johtuvia eroja .Jyvien proteiinipitoisuus oli sitä korkeampi mitä suurempaa typpiannosta käytettiin. Jaettu typpiannos tuotti korkeampia proteiinipitoisuuksia kuin suuri kerta- annos. Zeleny-luvut olivat yleensä korkeampia, jos kaikki typpi annettiin saman kasvukauden aikana. Jyvien tuhkapitoisuudessa ja jauhosaaliissa ei ollut typpilannoituksesta johtuvia eroja. Jauhon kostean sitkon määrä noudatti proteiinipitoisuutta. Kestoluvussa ja paisuntaluvussa ei ollut eroja. Valorimetriluvuissa ei ollut merkitseviä eroja. Sen sijaan ekstensogrammin pituus eli taikinan venyvyys noudatti proteiinipitoisuutta. Ekstensogrammin korkeus eli venytysvastus korreloi paremmin paisuntalukuihin. Taikinan vedensitomiskyvyssä ei ollut merkitseviä eroja, joskin suunta oli paraneva typpimäärän lisääntyessä. Leipätilavuutta selittivät parhaiten venytysvastusluku ja kestoluku, leipoutuvuutta edellisten lisäksi lajike. Nostatusaika ja lisäaineiden käyttö leivonnassa vaikuttivat vähintäin yhtä paljon leivontatulokseen kuin typpilannoitus. Käytetyt lajikkeet reagoivat eri tavalla typpilannoitukseen. Heikkositkoisten Linnan ja Elon leivontatulos muuttui suuria typpiannoksia käytettäessä yleensä negatiiviseen suuntaan, kun taas vahvasitkoinen linja a7780 reagoi lievemmin ja osittain jopa positiivisesti typpilannoituksen lisäämiseen.",

Also, the experiment included excess liming with 16 t Ca(OH)2/ha, with and without the addition of the 14 tons of the calcium silicate material. A two year experiment with silicate and lime was conducted on another loam soil (»B»), The silicate application produced higher yields of barley grain and straw; the effect being proportionately higher than that of an equivalent Ca(OH)2 application. Neither a yield depression caused by an excess lime excess potassium treatment nor a yield reduction due to boron application in the low lime series could be counteracted by silicate application (soil »A»), Significant yield increases for silicate and for lime were found in the 4th and 5th years after application, although the effects were reduced compared to the responses during the first 3 years. The silica content of barley grain and straw increased considerably after silicate application. In the first year, for example, the percent of SiO2 on straw dry matter rose from less than 1 percent to 7 percent. The silica treatments and the large SiO2 uptake, apparently had no direct effects upon the phosphorus, calcium, potassium or the magnesium content of the barley crops, although the silicate seemed to improve the soil phosphorus availability. In the high-lime series, potassium applications in the first two years of the experimental period roughly doubled the silica content of barley straw and grain, whereas such an effect by the potassium fertilizers was absent in the low-lime series for both soil (»A») and (»B»). After the five year cropping period, lime and silicate were found to have influenced the soil aggregate size distribution percentages, and had markedly improved the water stability of the soil aggregates.",

Tulokset perustuvat kautta maan 315 paikkakunnalta kerättyihin 2 040 lehtinäytteeseen. Valtaosa näytteistä kerättiin viljelijäin pelloilta viljan tuleentumisvaiheessa, heinäkuun puolenvälin ja elokuunlopun välisenä aikana. Kaikki näytteet määritettiin silmävaraisesti ja mikroskooppisesti. Lisäksi tehtiin sieniviljelmiä ja saastutuskokeita tarpeen mukaan. Eri viljalajien näytteissä olivat tärkeimpiä tauteja aiheuttavia sieniä seuraavat lajit: Kaura: Helminthosporium avenaeta Eidam esiintyi yleisesti kautta maan, sen sijaan H. sativum Pammel, King &amp; Bakke oli vähämerkityksinen. Samaa voidaan sanoa Septoria avenae Frank f. sp. avenaesta. Shaw, härmästä, Erysiphe graminis DC. ja ruosteista, sarviruosteesta, Puccinia coronala Corda ja mustaruosteesta, P. graminis Pers., joita kaikki esiintyi kauralla melko harvinaisina. Ohra: Helminthosporium-lajeja on pidettävä ohran yleisimpinä taudinaiheuttajina. H. gramineumia Rabenh. ex Schlecht., ohran viirutaudin aiheuttajaa, esiintyi yleisimpänä Pohjanmaalla ja maan pohjoisosissa, H. terestä Sacc., verkkolaikun ja lehtilaikun aiheuttajaa maan lounais- ja eteläosissa. Samoilla alueilla esiintyi myös H.sativumia, joskin vähäisemmässä määrin. H. grumineum ja H. teres olivat yleisempiä moni- kuin kaksitahoisilla lajikkeilla, päinvastoin kuin H. sativum. Rhynchosporium secalista (Oud.) J. J. Davis, ohran rengaslaikun aiheuttajaa esiintyi varsinkin monitahoisillalajikkeilla, joskus hyvinkin pahana taudinaiheuttajana. S. nodorum (Berk.) Berk. &amp; Br. ja S. avenae Frank f. sp. triticeaa T. Johnson, esiintyi yleisimpinä maan lounais- ja eteläosissa kaksitahoisilla lajikkeilla. Samoilla alueilla esiintyi yleisenä myös härmää, Erysiphe graminis. Ruosteita, kääpiöruostetta, Puccinia hordei Otth. ja mustaruostetta, P. graminis esiintyi melko vähän. Vehnä: Septoria-lajeja yhdessä härmän kanssa on pidettävä vehnän kasvustojen yleisimpinä taudinaiheuttajina. S. nodorum oli vallitseva laji sekä kevät että syysvehnällä. S. tritici Rob. ex Desm. esiintyi vain syysvehnällä oraissa keväällä. S. avenae f. sp. triticeaa. esiintyi varsinkin kevätvehnän lehdistöissä. Härmää, Erysiphe graminis esiintyi vehnällä yleisesti, erityisen runsaana kesällä 1973. Sensijaan ruosteita, valtalajina ruskearuostetta, Puccinia recondita Rob. ex Desm., harvinaisempana keltaruostetta, P. striiformis West. ja mustaruostetta, P. graminis, tavattiin huomattavasti vähemmän. Helminthosporium-lajeja, H. tritici-repentistä. Died, ja H. sativumia. esiintyi yleisemmin kevät- kuin syysvehnällä. Ruis: Rhynchosporium secalista tavattiin yleisesti varsinkin kasvukauden alkupuolella. Septoria-lajeja, S. secalisia Prill. &amp; Delacr. melko yleisena ja S. nodorumia harvinaisena, Helminthosporium tritici-repentisiä, härmää, Erysiphe graminis ja ruostetta, P. reconditaa. ja mustaruostetta, P. graminis esiintyi melko yleisesti ja usein yhdessä tuleentuvassa kasvustossa. Lisäksi esiintyi kautta maan kaikilla viljoilla, rukiilla tosin vähemmän kuin muilla, Fusarium-sieniä. Näistä olivat yleisimmät lajit F. culmorum (W. G. Sm.) Sacc., F. poae (Peck) Wr. ja F. avenaceum (Fr.) Sacc. sekä harvinaisempana todetut F. semiteclum Berk, et Rav., F. graminearum Schwabe, koteloaste Gibberella zeae (Schw.) Petch, ja F. nivale (Fr.)

    "abstract": "Siipikarjatalous on maassamme tällä hetkellä nopeasti kehittyvä tuotannonala. Siipikarjanlihan sekä kulutus että tuotanto on kasvanut ripeästi viime vuosina. Silti on henkeä kohti laskettu kulutus meillä tällä hetkellä Euroopan pienimpiä. Tätä taustaa vasten tarkasteltuna näyttävät tuotannon ja kulutuksen lisäämismahdollisuudet suotuisilta. Mainittakoon, että OECD:n (1968, p. 35) ennusteen mukaan siipikarjanlihan kokonaistuotos ja kulutus olisi maassamme v. 1985 25 milj. kg. Vastaava luku v. 1970 oli vain noin 4 milj. kg. Siipikarjanlihaa koskevat tilastot ovat maassamme erittäin puutteelliset. Käsitteiden epäselvyyttä lisää yhtenäisen terminologian puute. Riittämätön tilastoaineisto on ollut pääasiallinen syy siihen, että tässä tutkimuksessa saadut tulokset ovat eräiltä osin vain suuntaa antavia. Tämän vuoksi lisätutkimusten tarve on ilmeinen. Aikatekijän tilastollisesti merkitsevä regressiokerroin viittaisi siihen, että broilertuotannossa on tapahtunut teknistä kehitystä, ja että siinä on saavutettu rationalisointietua. Kysyntäanalyysiä haittasi havaintojen vähyyden ohella se, että koko maata koskevat per capita kulutusluvut yliarvioivat kulutuksen kasvun. Vertaamalla poikkileikkaus- ja aikasarja-analyysistä saatuja joustoja ja huomioimalla edellä mainittu virhe päädyttiin seuraaviin tulojoustojen estimaatteihin: siipikarjanliha yhteensä 2.00–3.00, varsinainen kananliha 1.50–2.00, broiler 4.00–5.00 Korkeat tulojoustot ja pienet kulutusmäärät viittaavat siihen, että siipikarjanliha on meillä ylellisyyshyödyke. Koska siipikarjanlihan rahamenot muodostavat erittäin pienen osan kuluttajien budjetista, ovat saadut ei-nollasta poikkeavat hintajouston estimaatit loogisia. Jos oletetaan henkeä kohden lasketun reaalikansantuotteen kasvavan vuosittain 5 % (vv. 1966—71 keskimääräinen kasvu oli 4.7 %), saadaan siipikarjanlihan kulutuksen kasvuksi per capita 10—15%/v. Vertailun vuoksi mainittakoon, että v. 1969 kulutuksen kasvu oli 17 % ja v. 1970 12 %. Vuosi 1971 ei ole vertailukelpoinen salmonellatapausten vuoksi. Yllä oleva ennuste pitää paikkaansa vain ceteris paribus-olettamuksen ollessa voimassa. Toisaalta ei neljännesvuosiarvoista saatuja joustoja voisi sellaisenaan soveltaa vuositasolle. Mainittakoon, että FAO (1971, p. 144) on käyttänyt Suomea koskevassa siipikarjanlihan kulutusennusteessa tulojouston arvoa 0.60, joka on selvästi liian alhainen. Mainitun ennusteen mukaan siipikarjanlihan kulutus henkeä kohti olisi maassamme v. 1980 vain 0.8 kg. Todellisuudessa tämä kulutustaso saavutettiin jo vuonna 1970.",

In the empirical study, the comparison is focused on situations where a decision on the possible transfer from forest to agricultural use may have current interest. On the basis of data, mostly collected from pioneer farms established after the war on forest or peat land within four main study areas in Finland, estimates of gross margin, social output, labour income and land rent are made, using the price structure of 1959-63. The comparisons indicate among other things that although agricultural land rent in the existing structure of farm size is often negative, the land rent in marginal calculation maybe positive. The land rent is neither the sole criterion of land use to the farmer, nor to the national economy, as the labour income plays an important role. The farmer's problem is to find the optimum combination of agricultural and forest activities. In the national economy, not only labour in primary production but also in secondary and tertiary industries has to be considered. The economic losses caused by badly timed forest land clearing are illustrated by calculations.",

    "abstract": "The effects of potato plant density on yield quantity and quality were investigated at the Hankkija Plant Breeding Institute from 1971-73, using seed rates of 1600, 3200 and 4800 kg/ha, and seed sizes of 40, 80 and 120 g. The varieties used were Ijsselster and Record. The number of stems per m2 rose with increasing seed rate and with increasing seed size. Stem number increased with seed rate faster for small seed than for large. The response in stem number was greater for Ijsselster than for Record. The number of stems per seed tuber fell as the plant density rose. The number of tubers per m2 altered in the same direction as the number of stems, but less responsively. The reason for this was that the number of tubers per stem decreased with increasing plant density. The tuber yield showed a continual increase with increasing plant density. At the lowest stem densities (less than 20—25 stems/m2) small seed gave better results than other sizes, but at the higher plant densities, the importance of seed size faded away and the yield was dependant on the plant density alone. Net yield (gross yield 2 x seed rate), however, was higher the smaller the seed used, whatever the stem density. Tuber size decreased when plant density increased, the proportion of large tubers diminishing most, especially when small seed was used. The proportion of small tubers altered more for Ijsselster than for Record. Seed size and seed rate did not on average significantly affect the proportion of Class I potatoes, though small seed gave results slightly better than other sizes. The starch content of the yield rose when the seed rate was increased (16.0-16.3 -16.5 %) and fell with increasing seed size (16.5 16.2 16.1 %). The maximum variation was 15.8-16.7 %. The specific gravity distribution improved with increasing plant density. Raw discolouration of the tubers did not alter significantly as the plant density rose. Blackening of the tubers decreased with increasing plant density when small and medium sized seed were used. Mealiness of the tubers was somewhat higher for small seed than for other seed sizes.",

    "abstract": "This preliminary 3-year field experiment with bark humus MoDo-Mylla revealed that an application of 28 tons d.m./ha of bark humus to a sandy soil increased the content of organic carbon by about 0.5 % and that application of 56 tons d.m./ha increased the organic content of the topsoil by about 1%. Corresponding increases in organic carbon were obtained following application of 30 and 60 tons d.m./ ha MoDo-Mylla to a clay soil. The largest yield increase resulting from bark humus was obtained in the first year on the clay soil in Uppland. This increase amounted to 81 per cent at 30 tons d.m./ha and 108percent at 60 tons d.m./ha, in comparison with treatments without bark humus. Positive effects were also obtained in the second year in oats, while in the third year (winter wheat) the yield was similar in all treatments. In the first year of the experiment on sandy soil in Dalarna there was no yield promoting effect from the bark humus, probably because the experiment had been laid out on a newly ploughed ley. Positive effects of the bark humus appeared in the second and third years in the potato yields which were 10 % and 5 % higher in the third year at 56 tons d.m./ha of MoDo-Mylla than in the treatment without MoDo-Mylla. No directly yield-promoting effects were noticed on the yield of straw. The determinations of bulk weight and 1 000-kernel weight revealed a clear trend towards increased kernel weight in the treatments with bark humus at both experimental sites. The chemical analyses of grain and straw show that on the clay soil the addition of MoDo-Mylla resulted in decreases in the contents of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the grain and, in addition to these, calcium in the straw. On sand soil the situtation is the reverse for nitrogen and potassium as an increase in these nutrients can be obtained following an application of bark humus. These differences in the nutrient content are probably linked with the yield levels.",

According to the results only 21 % of the persons replying had eaten the combination A -)- B+C + D. Even these combinations did not always contain enough fruit and/or vegetables, and meat, fish and/or eggs. Since many also ate a nutritionally poor breakfast, they probably did not obtain sufficient quantities of several essential nutrients. Also the sodium/potassium equilibrium of the food seemed to be unfavourable, and the consumption of fats and saturated fatty acids was too high.",

    "abstract": "Composition of milk is influenced among others by age, physiological state, health, breed, hormonal functions and level of milk yield of the cow. When these factors are kept constant the effects of chemical constituents and physical form of feeds on the composition of milk can be observed. In practical dairy cattle feeding it is relatively easy to produce changes in the contents of fat, fat-soluble vitamins and some trace elements, notably iodine, of milk. Also, it is possible to modify the fatty acid composition of milk fat in a direction which is believed to be desirable from the point of view of human nutrition. On the other hand, the content of proteins in cow's milk can hardly be influenced assuming that the cow has received such amounts of energy and crude protein as meet her nutritional requirements. The lactose content of cow’s milk cannot be influenced by feeding unless the level of glucose in the cow’s blood is below normal. If water-soluble vitamins are given to the cow, only a very small part of these are transferred into the milk. The same is true with regard to most minerals and trace elements.",

The experimental soil consisted of a silty clay rich in humus and a fine sand. The soils were kept at three moisture levels corresponding approximately to pF values 2, 3 and 4. Two levels of nitrogen were applied, 175 and 350 mg/kg, as ammonium nitrate. The clay and fine sand soils initially contained 370 and 780 mg/kg of nitrate nitrogen, respectively. The grass was harvested five times during 205 days. The excess of the nitrate in the clay soil prouducing high nitrate contents in the grass was exhausted after two cuttings when the soil moisture was kept at pF 2, whereas it was not reduced at all at pF 4. At pF 3, the excess nitrate was exhausted after the 3rd and 4th cutting at lower and higher nitrogen application levels, respectively. The nitrate content of the grass grown on the fines and soil was reduced to an acceptable level only at pF 2 and after the lower application of nitrogen, not before the last cutting, however.",

By 1972 the Society’s membership had risen to over 400 members. An essential part of the Society’s activities has consisted of meetings with lectures. In the six or seven meetings arranged annually the Society has heard in addition to Finnish research workers a number of visiting lecturers. In 1911 the Society inaugurated two series of publications; »Publications of the Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland» and »Abhandlungen der Agrikulturwissenschaftlichen Gesellschaft in Finnland». The former consisted of short summaries of research papers, lectures and information from the meetings, minutes of the meetings as well as annual reports and audits. The actual research papers were published in German in the latter publication. In 1928 the name of the German series was changed to »Acta Agralia Fennica» and as publication languages were chosen English, German, Swedish and Finnish. In 1929 the Society began the regular publication in English of the »Journal of the Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland». By the end of 1972, 129 issues had been published of the Acta Agralia Fennica. The number of published annual volumes of the Journal was 44, each volume consisting of four journals. At the beginning of 1973 the two publications were merged to form one comprehensive series under the name »Journal of the Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland». Each annual volume consists of 500—600 printed pages, the average number of issues being six, or minimum four, issues. The Library of the Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland is connected with the Agricultural Library of the University of Helsinki. In 1972 the Library had connections on an exchange basis with libraries in 43 countries.",

    "abstract": "Short term forecasts of agricultural production are used primarily in everyday agricultural policy, for example in the predictions of production and consuption of pork and beef, which indicate the need of exports and/or imports in order to achieve the target prices of these products. In some cases short term forecasts might also be used for setting targets. For example the market outlook could be taken into account when the target prices are determined so that they could be easily achieved. Long term predictions, covering 5 10 years, are useful above all in the planning of agricultural policy. The changes in the structure of agriculture and the agricultural population are responsible for the main part (up to 2/3) of the changes in the agricultural production in some countries. Together with an increase in the farm size, the use of the new technology becomes more general and specialization increases, which leads to larger variations in production. Forecasting these factors is clearly important for successful long term planning in agricultural policy. The accuracy of predictions is not always good even in short term forecasts despite the highly developed mathematical models. In the long run it is pointless to make detailed forecasts for different products, since by changing the price ratios it is possible to regulate production. Instead, more resources should be assigned to the forecasting of the technical-biological development, i.e. to the forecasting of the growth of the yields in crop and animal production and the effects of the changes in the structure of agriculture.",

    "abstract": "A literature review is presented over the factors that limit the quality of fish semi-preserves. The most important are the changes in fat, microbiological spoilage, and excessive proteolysis. It is possible to reduce the oxidative changes in fats by anti-oxidants and exclusion of oxygen from barrels and retail packs. The carbonyl compounds are mainly formed after the packs are opened. The high salt content and the anaerobic conditions in barrel-salted fish inhibit the growth of most microbes. After processing the pH of semi-preserves decreases and the microbial flora consists mainly of representatives of the family Lactobacillaceae. The shelf life of the products is prolonged by preservatives. The amino acids and soluble peptides which are liberated by enzymatically catalyzed proteolysis diminish the effect of preservatives, possibly by a reaction of the amino groups. A promising preservative is tylosin lactate which has been found very suitable for fish semi-preserves. Excessive proteolysis which softens the muscle tissue too much may prove to be the most harmful effect. From the quality point of view the muscle tissue has to contain an adequate amount of free amino acids. However, the amino acids may accelerate the enzymatic proteolysis by raising the pH. A high content of salt and acid retards the proteolysis but also weakens the quality. To prolong the shelf life of fish semi-preserves new methods will have to be developed.",

    "abstract": "Martti Salonen was born on January 20th, 1908. A degree of Bachelor of Agriculture and Forestry was conferred on him in 1937. In 1941 he became a Doctor of Agriculture and Forestry. Martti Salonen started his scientific career as an assistant in the Department of Agricultural Chemistry at Helsinki University, apost that he held for ten years. During the war he was called into the service of the Ministry of Agriculture as a secretary to the fertilization department of the Production Committee of Agriculture. After the war Martti Salonen devoted his time chiefly to scientific work. In 1945—4B he was the managing director of the Society of Peat Cultivation, in 1949—5l he served as a teacher of soil science in the University of Technology; at the same time he was Professor of Agronomy at the University. Subsequently, until 1971, Salonen held the professorship in Agricultural Chemistry and Physics in the Agricultural Research Centre. Some of the earliest research work of Professor Salonen consisted of comparisons concerning determination techniques of potassium and phosphorus, subjects which also interested him later. The dissertation »On the Existing Forms of Phosphorus in the Soil in Finland», which came out in 1941, formed the actual basis for his research work. After completing the dissertation he began to study the effects of liming on the mobilization of nitrogen and phosphorus and especially on the easily soluble and organic phosphorus of the soil. Later he completed outstanding reports, among other subjects, on the position of roots of cultivated plants in different kinds of soil. As director of the Department of Agricultural Chemistry and Physics Martti Salonen studied and solved many basic problems relating to the cultivation of plants. A number of comprehensive reports dealing with the fertilization of plants date back to this period. The research done under his guidance on the placing of fertilizers deserves special mention. Salonen worked out and coordinated the fertilization results of different nutrients in extensive field experiments which were carried out in different parts of Finland. In addition to concentrated fertilizers he has directed his attention also to the effects of farm yard manure.",

    "abstract": "Using a variety of culture media, counts of live bacteria in the faeces of milking cows on purified, protein-free feed in which urea was the only source of nitrogen (0-cows) and on urea-rich, low-protein feed (ULP-cows) were made. Samples were taken from 3 0-cows and 3 ULP-cows weekly. Counts of lactobacilli, micrococci, propionic acid bacteria and lactate-utilising butyric acid bacteria were made during a period of 41 weeks, and counts of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, enterococci and coliform bacteria for 26 weeks. Counts are given as log10 number/g fresh faeces. In the 0 cows anaerobic bacteria counts were 5—9, ULP cows 6—9; aerobic bacteria were 5—7 and 5—8 respectively. »Propionic acid bacteria» counts were 4—7 with both 0- and ULP-cows, lactobacilli 3—8 in 0 cows and 4—8 in ULP cows, and micrococci 2—7 in both groups. Enterococci were 2—6 in 0 cows and 37 in ULP cows, and coliforms 3—6 and 2—6respectively. Lactate utilising butyric acid bacteria were 0—4600/g fresh faeces, being fewer in 0-cows than in ULP cows. There was large variation in the counts of all bacteria from one week to the next. In a single cow almost all the bacterial counts could be low at the same time and the following week they could all be high. In different animals the timing of these variations was not the same. The counts of bacteria growing under anaerobic conditions were the main exception to the above variations. The ratio between gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in faeces was measured and it was found that with both types of test feed the gram-negative were more numerous. In addition the occurrence of bacterial spores was studied; their counts, as a proportion of the total number of bacteria reacting to stain, averaged 6.5 and 26.7 % respectively in 0- and ULP-cows.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews some key elements of Finnish animal breeding research contributing to the Finnish dairy cattle breeding programme and discusses the possibilities and problems in collecting data for genetic evaluation, prediction of breeding values both within and across countries, estimation of the economic value of important traits, and selection of bulls and cows. Economic values are calculated for fertility, udder health and production traits when one genetic standard deviation unit (gen. sd.) is changed in each trait independently and the financial returns from selection response in the Finnish dairy cattle breeding programme are estimated. The following components were used to calculate the economic value of mastitis treatments: 1) cost of mastitis including discarded milk and treatment costs, 2) reduction in milk price due to higher somatic cell count, 3) replacement costs and 4) lower production level of the herd due to involuntary culling of cows because of udder problems. A high somatic cell count lowers the price of milk and eventually leads to involuntary culling. For treatments for fertility disorders the following costs were included: 1) treatment costs 2) higher replacement costs and 3) decreased milk production in the herd. Days open included the following costs: 1) extra insemination, 2) reduced annual milk yield and 3) fewer calves born. Animal breeding was found to be a very cost effective investment, yielding returns of FIM 876.9 per cow from one round of selection when the gene flow was followed for over 25 years in the Finnish dairy cattle breeding programme.",

    "abstract": "On a global basis, livestock products - meat, milk, eggs and fibre - account for 40% of the value of total marketed agricultural product. Animal products provide essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals to help ensure nutritionally balanced diets. In developing countries, livestock traction and manure also contribute to food production through improved cultivation and soil fertility which increase crop yields. On average, the proportional contribution of livestock product to dietary calories and protein in developed countries is double that for developing countries. Demand for livestock products is fuelled by the population increase, income growth and urbanisation in developing countries. Therefore, over the past decade, consumption of livestock product has sharply increased in developing countries, while slightly decreasing in developed countries where consumption is already relatively high on average. Increased demand in developing countries increases income for producers, but also stresses the environment through pollution, soil erosion, overgrazing and deforestation. Research involving global partnerships of scientists and institutes can help ensure that the increased demands for livestock product in developing countries will be met in economically feasible and environmentally sustainable ways.",

The largest one was the red plum group, the yellow plum group being the second largest. Victoria-type plums, which have not been reported to occur in Finland before and which resemble the English cultivar ‘Victoria’, make up the third group. Victoria-type plums proved to be fully and red plums partly self-compatible, whilst the yellow plums were selfincompatible. All the local races of plum were evaluated for their possible further use.

The structure of agriculture is described in the model by the agricultural population as well as by the number, the average size and distribution of all the farms, dairy farms, pig farms, poultry farms and non-animal farms. The agricultural population is calculated by forecasting its share from the total population as a function of GDP. The number of farms is derived from the agricultural population by assuming that the size of a farm family is constant. The average size of the farm is derived by dividing the total acreage by the number of farms. The distribution of farms is forecasted by applying a logarithmic normal distribution function. The starting points for the structure of animal production are the consumption forecasts and self-sufficiency targets. The development of the average yield per animal is forecasted by applying a trend line. Also the average size of animal farms is forecasted by a trend. The number of animal farms is obtained simply by dividing the number of animals by the average farm size.",

Tässä tutkimuksessa on tutkittu eräiden sisäistä laatua mittaavien menetelmien käyttökelpoisuutta. Näitä menetelmiä on käytetty sitten markkinoilla olevien kasviksien laadun arvioimiseen. Tutkimuskohteena oli kolme kasvista: salaatti, tomaatti ja porkkana. Kasvikset saatiin tukkuliikkeiltä; joitakin näytteitä hankittiin vähittäiskaupasta tai torilta. Aineisto oli pääasiallisesti kotimaista, vain pieni osa ulkomaista alkuperää. Pääsarjaan kuului tukkukaupan näytteitä kaikista kolmesta kasviksesta 6 kertaa vuoden aikana. Tomaatin laatua tutkittiin lisäksi torilta hankitulla eri hintaisella tavaralla. Varastointikokeita suoritettiin salaatilla ja tomaatilla. Laadun arvioinnissa käytettiin aistinvaraista arvostelua (pistearvostelumenetelmä); tutkitut laatuominaisuudet olivat maku, haju, rakenne ja ulkonäkö. Lisäksi arvioitiin laatuluokka. Analyyttisinä kriteereinä olivat liukoinen kuiva-aine, happopitoisuus, askorbiinihappo sekä nitraattipitoisuus, toisinaan myös painohäviö ja kauppakunnostustappio. Aistinvarainen arvostelu soveltui parhaiten sisäisen laadun arvioimiseen. Enimmäkseen laatuluokan kaupallinen arviointi sopi yhteen aistinvaraisesti todettavien ominaisuuksien kanssa, mutta toisinaan todettiin kitkerää makua tai muuta virhemakua. Nitraattipitoisuudessa todettiin suuria vaihteluita, jotka olivat laatuluokituksesta riippumattomia. Muut kokeillut menetelmät soveltuvat huonommin sisäisen laadun mittaamiseen; niihin voivat vaikuttaa monet eri tekijät.

The same qualities give also a satisfactory estimate of the meatiness. In the progeny testing, used in control of phenotype testing, the carcass weight alone is a sufficient measure for the estimation of meat yield.

The objectives concerning management were the first cutting date and cutting frequency of a clover-grass stand and the number of cuttings, N-fertilization and seeding rate of a pure fescue stand. The most important growth factors in spring dry matter production were temperature sum (∑ > 0° C), solar radiation sum and N-fertilization. In summer growth the most important variables in the regression model were factors relating to precipitation. In the fall DM growth the most determining factors were the growth activity in the previous cut, N-fertilization and the amount of light. The spring growth was characterized by the distinct changes among all components of the yield studied. The shape of all spring growth models was strongly sigmoidal. As the growing season progressed DM yield or quality characteristics of the yield as a function of time or temperature sum in degree days approached the quadratic or linear relationships. The energy value of a clover-grass stand varied between the range of 4.274— 4.633 kcal gr-1. The photosynthetic efficiency of the stand among different cutting systems in 1974—75 was between 0.31—1.12 % determined from the total radiation per unit area. Deficiency of water was the most important factor causing variation in assimilation efficiency. Cutting frequency was the most important factor influencing the yield distribution of the season, the relationships among plant species and the formation of the total yields. Less important management factor was the first cutting date. N fertilization increased DM yields significantly in all cutting systems. The increase in use of nitrogen from 130 to 260 kg N ha-1 raised the protein content of the yield by 4.2 % units and the protein yield by 485 kg ha-1. The maximum DM yields in the seeding year and during the following three production years were obtained with seeding rates of 60, 30, 15 and 7.5 kg ha-1 respectively. The quality of the yield was very little influenced by growing density.",

In 1538 Kurjala rented Marjaniemi to the inhabitants of Lyöttilä proper and gave up Pilkanmaa, probably at the same time. Pyhäniemi was held by Kurjala until the beginning of the 17th century as a secret horse breeding farm defaulting taxes. Two large uninhabited woodland areas, Toittulanmaa and, what was later named Kymentaustanmaa, as well as an adjacent one-farm community, Niemenkylä, were also included in the medieval Lyöttilä. The parish church of litti was established on the Niemenkylä area at the beginning of the 16th century, resulting in the removal of the Niemenkylä farm into the area of Lyöttilä proper. Two new villages, Pilkanmaa and Kyöperilä, grew from Lyöttilä proper in the late 16th century. Similarly, Niemenkylä was separated from Lyöttilä as a landed estate of the parish priest, or »Pappila», and later developed into a separate village named Kirkonkylä (»Church Village»).",

Samalla pyrittiin löytämään syitä viljelmien välisiin työnmenekkieroihin. Keskimääräiseksi vuotuiseksi kokonaistyönmenekiksi 1000 m2 kohti saatiin lyhyessä viljelyssä 682 tuntia, keskipitkässä viljelyssä 1553 tuntia ja pitkässä viljelyssä 1616 tuntia. Yksittäisistä työvaiheista käytettiin eniten työtä (27 %) versojen leikkaukseen. Sadonkorjuuseen kului 16 % työajasta. Kasvukauden aikainen työnmenekin viikkojakautuma oli hyvin erilainen eri viljelmillä. Useilla pitkää viljelyä harjoittavilla viljelmillä oli työhuippu sadonkorjuukaudella. Keskimääräinen työntuotos oli lyhyessä viljelyssä 27,6 kg/h, keskipitkässä viljelyssä 20,4 kg/h ja pitkässä viljelyssä 25,2 kg/h. Keskimääräinen työntuotos sadonkorjuutyössä oli 154,2 kg/h sekä lajittelussa ja pakkauksessa 229,1 kg/h. Viljelmien välisiä työnmenekkieroja ei pystytty selvittämään lineaarisella regressioanalyysillä. Yksittäisten työvaiheiden tarkastelussa todettiin automatisoinnin selvästi vähentäneen työnmenekkiä. Kuitenkin yrittäjän organisointikyvyllä ja hänen sekä muiden työntekijäin yksilöllisellä suorituskyvyllä näytti olleen hyvin suuri vaikutus työnmenekin vaihteluihin.",

    "abstract": "Nurmisäilörehun rehuarvon muutoksia ja säilöntätappioita käytännön oloissa tutkittiin Viikin koetilalla vuosina 1970-1973. Säilörehu tehtiin maatilan ohjelman mukaisesti neljään 9 m korkeaan ja 118—346 m3:n vetoiseen betonisiiloon. 1. ja 2. korjuukerran ruoho oli laidun tai säilörehunurmilta, 3. korjuukerran ruoho niittonurmien odelmaa tai säilörehunurmen kolmatta satoa. Pääkasvilajeja olivat nurminata ja timotei. Ruohoa esikuivattiin aina kun sää sen salli, kuivausaika vaihteli 4 tunnista 4 ½ vuorokauteen. Esikuivatun ruohon ka-pitoisuus siiloon ajettaessa oli 14 (sateenkastelema) —76 %, niittotuoreen 13—25 %. Muurahaishappoa lisättiin esikuivattuun 0—0.15 %, sateen kastelemaan esikuivattuun ja niittotuoreeseen 0.30 %. Siilot täytettiin yksi kerrallaan, säästä riippumatta. 3.korjuukerran ruohosta suuri osapantiin entisenrehun päälle, muovikalvo oli välissä. Siiloihin pantiin lähes joka korjuupäivä juuttisäkkejä, joihin oli punnittu tietty määrä ruohoa. Säkkirehun perusteella laskettiin rehuarvon muutokset ja säilöntätappiot. Tulosten käsittelyssä oli 65 säkkiä esikuivattuja ja 22 säkkiä niittotuoreita. Näytteistä määritettiin eri aineosien lisäksi in vitro -sulavuus sekä laskettiin D-arvon ja raakaproteiinipitoisuuden perusteella ME-arvo. Esikuivatussa rehuarvon lasku ja säilöntätappiot olivat merkitsevästi pienemmät kuin niittotuoreessa. Kun omiksi ryhmikseen koottiin 1) sateella siiloon ajatut, 2) ne joihin valui päältä runsaasti mehua, 3) ilman säilöntäainetta säilötyt ja 4) loput, todettiin ryhmien 1—2 ja 3—4 välillä suuria eroja koostumuksen huononemisessa, ME-arvon laskussa ja säilöntätappioissa (P &lt; 0.01—0.001). Päältä valuva mehu oli pahempi kuin korjuu sateella. Suuret ka-tappiot ja rehun energia-arvon lasku liittyivät kiinteästi yhteen. Keskimääräinen orgaanisen aineen in vitro -sulavuuden lasku oli 3.7 % ja ME-arvon lasku 3.5 %. Raakaproteiinipitoisuuteen tappiot vaikuttivat hyvin vähän, koska kuiva-aine- ja proteiinitappiot olivat saman suuruisia. Suuriin tappioihin liittyi rehun heikko laatu. 1. korjuukerran ruoho ja vastaava säilörehu oli sulavuudeltaan ja ME-arvoltaan muita parempaa. Käyminen oli siinä merkitsevästi (P &lt; 0.001) voimakkaampaa kuin 3. korjuun rehussa, vaikka vesipitoisuus oli viimeksi mainitussa korkeampi. Vuosia vertailtaessa säilöntätulokseen vaikutti eniten ruohon kuiva-ainepitoisuus säilöttäessä ja korjuuajan satoisuus. Sadekesän 1972 rehu oli ravintoarvoltaan ja laadultaan muita heikompaa. Ruohon ja vastaavan säilörehun monien aineosien välillä todettiin kiinteitä korrelaatioita, samoin eri koostumusmuutosten ja tappioiden välillä. Säilöntätulosten hajonta osoittautui käytännön säilörehun valmistuksessa huomattavasti suuremmaksi, mitä järjestetyissä koe-oloissa tapahtuu. Yli kolmanneksella näytteistä kuiva-ainetappiot olivat alle 5 % ja kymmenellä prosentilla yli 25 %. Pahimmat virheet säilörehun teossa olivat seuraavat: 1) Sateen sattuessa säilörehun tekoa jatkettiin samaan siiloon, jolloin esikuivatun päälle tuli sateen kastelemaa esikuivattua tai niittotuoretta. 2) Syksyllä pantiin entisen rehun päälle niittotuoretta ruohoa tai peräti naatteja. Saumaamaton muovikalvo oli välissä, mutta se ei estänyt puristemehua valumasta rehuun. Toisaalta, sateen kastelemastakin ruohosta myös lyhyen aikaa esikuivatusta saatiin hyvä tulos silloin, kun se ajettiin siilon pohjalle ja päälle tuli painoksi niin kuivaa ruohoa, ettei siitä valunut mehua.",

Ethephon ruiskutettiin 4 päivää ennen sadon korjuutta. Ethephon lisäsi irronneiden marjojen määrää kaikissa koelajikkeissa ja kaikilla koepaikoilla. Ethephonin teho suureni ruiskutteen pitoisuuden kasvaessa. Ennen koesuunnitelman mukaista korjuupäivää (4 vrk käsittelyn jälkeen) pudonneiden marjojen osuus koko sadosta oli lajikkeesta ja koeoloista riippuen 0.6—13.1 % 250 ppm:n, 16.7-78.9% 500 ppm:n ja 34.1—84.0 % 1000 ppm:n ruiskuteväkevyyttä käytettäessä. Ennen poimintaa varisseiden marjojen määrä oli pienin ’Wellington XXX’ mustaherukalla ja ’Rondom’punaherukalla. Poimitun sadon raakojen marjojen suhteellinen osuus pieneni ethephon-käsittelyn johdosta vain nuorissa 'Brödtorp’-pensaissa. Ethephon ei nopeuttanut raakojen marjojen jälkikypsymistä, mutta sen sijaan ylikypsien marjojen osuus kypsissä marjoissa lisääntyi ’Rondom’-punaherukalla kaikissa ethephon-käsittelyissä, 500 ja 1000 ppm:n käsittelyissä ’Wellington XXX’- ja 500 ppm:n käsittelyssä ’ Risager’-mustaherukalla.

    "abstract": "Different types of distributed lag models were constructed for the aggregate fertilizer consumption in Finland. The main attention was focused upon those models that could be used for forecasting variations in fertilizer consumption. Before specification of the demand models, a method of time series analysis (EPA-method consisting of several subsequent moving averages) was applied to quarterly time series data on the quantities of the main plant nutrients to divide them into three components: 1) trend cycle-, 2) seasonal- and 3) irregular components. In addition, the average growth rates for fertilizer consumption were computed for different periods. In the formulation of demand models it was assumed that the variations in fertilizer consumption depend on the variations in the prices of fertilizer, agricultural products and other farm inputs as well as on the variations in the farm cash receipts. Two types of distributed lag models were used: 1) polynomial lag models (formulated by Almon) and 2) Nerlovian partial adjustment models. Polynomial lag formulations seemed to give the best results as compared to a priori hypotheses. The demand for fertilizer was found to be rather elastic with respect to the price ratio between fertilizer and agricultural products. The response of the farmers, however, spreads with respect to time: at its highest, the response is about two economic years after the change in the price ratio. Also, the variations in farm cash receipts were found to be an important determinant of the variations in fertilizer consumption. In order to test the validity of the constructed models for forecasting purposes, expost forecasts of total fertilizer consumption were computed for the economic year 1973/74and ex-ante forecasts for the economic year 1974/75 by means of some models.",

The digestibilities were determined by total collection the collection period lasting seven days. The rumen samples were taken on the last two days during the collection periods before and 1.5, 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 hours after feeding. Besides the silages the animals received mineral mixture and water ad libitum. Urea or acid treatment had no effect (P &gt; 0.05) on the consumption of silage DM. The consumption ranged from 1.7 to 1.9 kg DM/100 kg liveweight. Urea did not have a clear effect on the VFA production in the rumen. It tended, however, to decrease the proportions of C3 and C4—C5 acids in the rumen. Acid preservative decreased the production of VFA and the proportion of C3-acid (P &lt; 0.05) in the rumen. The proportion of C3-acid was higher respectively, (P &lt; 0.05). The rumen ammonia levels were extremely high, 60—80 mg/100 ml, after feeding with urea treated silages. This was possibly partly due to the relatively short (14 days) adaptation time before collection period. The urea or acid preservative treatment gave no clear responses regarding the apparent digestibility values of the silages. The DCP values were highest (P &lt; 0.05) in the urea treated silages, but no differences (P &gt; 0.05) were found between the energy values, which varied between 0,12—0.14 f.u./kg of silage.

The organic matter digestibilities of the diets were not affected (p&gt;0.05) by the silage absorbent treatment. The digestibility of SBS silage was, however, improved by grFA as an additive.

The aim of the experiment was to study the effect of nitrogen and choice of cultivar on sod production and sod quality on peat bogs. The N fertilization rates were 50, 100 and 150kg ha-1. The Poa pratensis cultivars were ‘Conni’, ‘Cynthia’, ‘Haga’ and ‘Julia’, the Festuca rubra cultivars were ‘Center’, ‘Juliska’, ‘Koket’ and ‘Näpsä’ and the Agrostis capillaris cultivar was ‘Rasti’. Two mixtures of P. pratensis/F. rubra and one of A. capillaris/F. rubra imitated commercial sod products. Increasing of N fertilization from 50 kg up to 150 kg ha-1 a had positive effect on general the quality of sod as well as on the green cover before and after transplanting. It increased the thatch formation. The positive effect of N on the number of tillers and green cover in the year following transplanting was dependent on the species and the cultivar. Species and cultivar affected all measured variables excluding thatch formation. Generally, the P. pratensis cultivars tested suited better for sod production than cultivars of F. rubra, but there were clear differences between cultivars within species as well. Although the soil was infertile, the contents of Ca, K, Mg, P, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Zn in the herbage samples were within normal range. The botanical purity was high, which supports the hypothesis that the absence of seed bank of weeds on peat bogs immediately after harvesting the peat can be utilized.",

Kuiva-ainepitoisuus vaihteli pikkuistukassipuleilla rajoissa 11,9 . . . 13,5%, ryvässipuleilla rajoissa 17,4 ... 18,6%. Erotus johtui lähes kokonaan liukoisten hiilihydraattien määrästä. Pelkistävien sokerien pitoisuus oli pikkuistukassipuleilla keskimäärin 0,5 %-yksikköä korkeampi kuin ryvässipuleilla. Palorypälehappopitoisuus oli ryvässipuleilla lähes poikkeuksetta korkeampi tuorepainoa kohti laskettuna. Korjuun jälkeen oli ryvässipulinäytteiden palorypälehappopitoisuuden keskiarvo lähes 50 % korkeampi kuin pikkuistukassipulien. Säilytyksen kestäessä palorypälehappopitoisuus kohosi kummallakin ryhmällä, ja ryhmien välinen ero pieneni. Palorypälehappopitoisuus oli korrelaatiossa kuiva-ainepitoisuuteen, lisäksi osassa näytteitä pelkistävien sokerien pitoisuuteen, osassa näytteitä aminotyppeen. Viljelyn kestäessä kohosi palorypälehapon taso tuleentumiseen asti, ja laski tämän jälkeen. Eri lajikkeilla saavutettiin maksimikohta eri aikoina. Esikuivaus kohotti palorypälehapon pitoisuutta, eri lajikkeilla saavutettiin maksimi eri lämpötiloissa. Kahdella pikkuistukkasipulikannalla todettiin esikuivauksen johtavan merkittävään kuiva-ainetappioon, liukoisten hiilihydraattien pitoisuuden laskuun ja pelkistävien sokerien pitoisuuden nousuun. Pakastettuna säilytetyissä sipulinäytteissä kohosi palorypälehapon taso ensimmäisen säilytyskauden aikana vain vähäisessä määrin ja laski edelleen säilytettäessä. -1 ja +4° C:n säilytyksessä tapahtui kummassakin palorypälehappopitoisuuden nousua, kunnes +4°:ssa säilytetty sipuli alkoi itää tai pilaantua. Laboratoriomittakaavan pakkaskuivauskokeissa säilyi aromista palorypälehappopitoisuuden mukaan arvosteltuna keskimäärin 85,7 %.",

Tuoreen ja kuivatun sipulin aromin voimakkuus määritettiin kemiallisesti arominmuodostusreaktion eräänä tuotteena syntyvän palorypälehapon määränä sekä veteen lietetyn sipulin hajun kynnysarvona. Palorypälehapon muodostuksen ja kynnysarvon logaritmin välillä havaittiin käänteinen korrelaatio, mutta hajonnan takia lisäsi molempien menetelmien käyttö rinnan määrityksen luotettavuutta. Eräissä tapauksissa arvosteltiin kuivasipulin aromia aistinvaraisilla makuprofiili- ja arvopistemenetelmillä. Välittömästi korjuun jälkeen suoritettu lyhyt esikuivaus 28° C:n lämpötilassa lisäsi ryvässipuli Lemin palorypälehapon muodostusta keskimäärin 18%. Kylmävarastointi vaikutti myös palorypälehapon muodostusta lisäävästi ja muodostus oli 5 kuukauden varastoinnin jälkeen 40 % alkuperäistä korkeammalla tasolla. Tutkittaessa ryväs- ja pistosipulin edullisia pakkaskuivausolosuhteita todettiin molempien soveltuvan hyvin pakkaskuivaukseen. Pakkaskuivaussyklin minimikesto oli 8 kg/m2:n kuormituksella 6 tuntia, kun valmisteen vesipitoisuus oli 3,5 %. Hitaasti jäädytetty (—20° C, ilman virtausnopeus 2,3 m/s) sipuli kutistui kuivauksen aikana vähemmän ja kuivavalmiste oli parempilaatuinen kuin nopeampaa jäädytystä käytettäessä. Kaikki arominmääritysmenetelmät osoittivat kotimaisesta materiaalista pakkaskuivattujen sipulivalmisteiden olevan varsin aromirikkaita kirjallisuustietoihin ja tutkittuihin kaupallisiin valmisteisiin verrattuina. Tällöin edellytettiin kuitenkin, että sipulin pienentäminen suoritettiin välttäen solujen murskaamista. Makuprofiilin perusteella esiintyivät sipulille luonteenomaiset kirpeät ja pistävät (pungent) ja kyynelöitymistä aiheuttavat tekijät (lachrymatory factor) voimakkaina kotimaisissa kuivavalmisteissa. Palorypälehapporetentio oli ryvässipulin pakkaskuivauksessa keskimäärin 90 % ja pistosipulilla keskimäärin 70 %. Ryvässipulin korkea liukoisten hiilihydraattien pitoisuus vaikutti ilmeisesti edullisesti retentioon. Pakkaskuivatun ryvässipulin kynnysarvo vaihteli välillä 1,2. . . 2,7 mg kuiva-ainetta/1000 ml ja pistosipulin välillä 0,4 . . . 0,7 mg kuiva-ainetta/1000 ml kun kirjallisuuden vastaavat arvot vaihtelevat välillä 2,5 ...40 mg kuiva-ainetta/1000 ml. Palorypälehapon muodostus oli sekä ryväs- että pistosipulista pakkaskuivatulla valmisteella noin 45 /µmol kuiva-ainegrammaa kohti. Ryvässipulin korkea kuiva-aine (17,5 ... 20 %) on varsin edullinen pakkaskuivauksen taloudellisuuden kannalta.",

The frequency distributions of the DBC protein content in both descendant groups were unimodal and no effect of one gene was seen, even though the high lysine content of Hiproly is caused by one gene (lys). The means of the DBC protein contents in these F5 generations were 19.1 % and 19.0 %. Environmental factors have a great effect on the DBC protein content: environmental variances from the total variances were 93.84 % and 41.54 %. In the lines with the highest DBC protein contents there were generally more basic amino acids, phenylalanine and proline, than in the lines with the lowest DBC protein contents. Therefore, it appears that the lines with the highest DBC protein contents contain much albumins and prolamins. Also, the ratios of basic amino acids to proline indicated that the relationships between albumins and prolamins were nearly the same for all the lines. Thus, the high DBC protein content in many lines is really based on high amounts of albumins and prolamins at the same time. The present study indicated that Hiproly may be better than the Risø 1508 mutant of barley in breeding for the yielding capacity, because the lys gene of Hiproly does not seem to decrease the prolamin content.",

Their rations were a combination of a protein concentrate mixture, barley, mineral and vitamins according to nutrient requirements for a growth rate of 1000 g/animal/day. Oats and barley straw was available ad libitum. In the experimental group the protein concentrate mixture was treated with formaldehyde, 0,88 g/100 g crude protein, whereas in the control group it was untreated. The proportion of treated protein was 45 % of the total protein in the diet. The study involved feeding trials, digestibility and nitrogen balance trials, and rumen fluid investigations. The live weight gain of the bulls in the experimental group was 10 % better than that of the control group. The amount of feed used per kg live weight gain was 8 % less in the former group than in the latter. The differences in both cases were, however, not significant (P &gt; 0,05). The differences in the digestibility and nitrogen balance and in the pH, ammonia and VFA concentrations of the rumen fluid between the groups were small and insignificant (P &gt; 0,05).",

The sulfur of 0-feed was composed entirely of inorganic sulfate. During balance trials the N:S ratio in the feed varied from 6.1 to 9.5, and the sulfur content from 0.22 to 0.31 % of the dry matter. In every trial (seven with 0-feed and two with ULP-feed), of five or seven days duration, the cows were in high-positive sulfur balance. The 0-cows excreted a greater proportion of their total sulfur output via urine than the ULP-cows. The excretion of inorganic sulfate sulfur, as a proportion of the urinary and faecal sulfur, was greater for 0-cows than for ULP- or NorP-cows (cows on normal, protein-rich feed); the opposite was the case with regard to the excretion of ester sulfate sulfur and neutral sulfur. The sulfur contents of milk and blood showed only minor inter-feed differences. The sulfate content in the rumen fluid of the 0-cow rose rapidly after the commencement of feeding and then fell quite rapidly. We conclude tentatively that in the rumen of the 0-cow hydrogen sulfide is generated so quickly that the whole of it cannot be used for the synthesis of sulfur-containing compounds, a considerable proportion of it being lost in eructations or excreted as inorganic sulfates in the urine.",

For determination of pasture grass intake of clipping method was compared with the indicator technique, chromium oxide being used as an indicator. Studies on behaviour were made to clarify the development of the ruminating function of the calves as well as the effect of cut and pasture grass plus a concentrate supplement on their behaviour. The digestibility of organic matter of pasture grass was I—4 %-units higher than that of cut grass. Intake of grass indoors was approximately 1940 g DM per animal per day. With the clipping method the average intake of pasture grass was 1355 g DM per animal per day and with the indicator technique 2061 g. The latter value seemed to be nearer the correct one, if a conlcusion is to be drawn from the live weight gain of the calves. Time used for intake of grass increased rapidly once the liquid feeding period was ended, that is during the whole experimental time up to eight of the 14.5 hours of the observation interval. Calves at the age of 26—37 days ruminated for approximately 116 min in eight hours. Supplementation of concentrates considerably decreased the time spent eating and increased the time spent ruminating by a small amount.",

Internal factors are also taken into account in estimating the evolution of agricultural production in the 1980's. Milk production is predicted to drop to 2910 mill. litres, beef production to 105 mill. kg. and egg production to 70 mill. kg. by 1985. Comsumption of pork is increasing and, therefore, the pork production is estimated to rise to 180 mill. kg. Similarly, the prospects for poultry meat are good as the production is forecasted to increase to 25 mill. kg. by 1985. There forecasts imply that the volume of agricultural production will remain quite stable. Since the yields in crop production are expected to increase by 1.5 per cent per year, overproduction would likewise seem to rise. However, the cultivated area has decreased and evidently will decrease further in the future due to policy measures aimed at curtailing the growth of production. Consequently the overproduction situation will not deteriorate very much from what it is at present.",

The effects of the herbicide on the morphology and anatomy were studied by light and electron microscopes and the effects on the chlorophyll content of leaves were studied at various intervals after the spraying. First sign of damage in the morphology of plants grown both at 23° C and 15°C were observable 10-12 days after the spraying but those in the ultrastructure as soon as 1 day after the treatment. The cells of the vascular bundle sheath were most sensitive while the mesophyll cells were unchanged during the total observation period of 12 days at 15°C. At a higher temperature injuries of various stages were observable also in the mesophyll 6 days after the treatment. The clearest alterations became visible in the chloroplasts. They swelled to spherical in shape, the intergrana and later also grana lamellae formed vesicles by dilating, later they broke down, and ultimately the plastid envelope disintegrated. The amount of starch and chlorophyll decreased, whereas the number and size of osmiophilic plastoglobuli increased significantly. The mitochondria swelled, the cristae frequently disappeared and the outer membrane of the envelope distended largely. The nucleus was best capable of resisting the toxic effects of the herbicide. The tonoplast and plasmalemma were broken down a short time before the final disintegration of the cell structures. High temperature obviously reinforced the toxic effects of the herbicide mixture.",

In the present study, the frequency of DFD meat in 693 bulls reared at 45 farms was examined in relation to the production environment on the farms. The incidence of DFD meat is increased by housing in group pens at the slaughterhouse, high atmospheric humidity and poor hygiene in the farm buildings, failure to keep the animals clean and rearing in standings. In an analysis of variance,29.9 % of the variation in the pH of the carcasses was explained when the independent variables were: the mode of lairage at the slaughterhouse (group pens vs. individual spaces, 17.1 %), the atmospheric humidity in the farm buildings (8.6 %), the management at the farms (pens. vs. standings, 6.3 %), the slaughterhouse (three slaughterhouses 3.8 %)and the level of hygiene at the farm(1.9 %). The reduction in the variation explained caused by the removal of each variable is given in percentage units in parentheses. The influence of feeding was slight, being smaller than that of a good rearing environment and individual spaces at the slaughterhouse, but intensive feeding and a high growth rate were also connected with a low DFD percentage.",

The increase in the equivalent ratio of the three potassium rates and the two magnesium rates decreased the magnesium content of both the grains and the straws.

The samples were obtained from 4 field trials performed in northern Finland.

Nitrogen was applied as NPK compound fertiliser and sulphur in the form of gypsum. In trials 1and 2 sulphur given in addition to nitrogen increased the yield considerably. The contents of soluble-, protein-, a-amino-, ammonium- and nitrate-nitrogen, as well as the free and peptide- and protein-bound amino acids were determined in the harvested timothy. Nitrogen fertilisation did not have any noticeable effect on the protein-nitrogen content of sulphur-deficient plants, but sulphur fertilisation increased it by an average of 26 % (trial 2). The proportion of soluble nitrogen of the total nitrogen in trials 1 and 2 averaged 50 % with N-fertilisation and 37 % with N+S fertilisation. Sulphur fertilisation decreased the contents of a-amino-, ammonium- and nitrate-nitrogen, and also their proportions of the total nitrogen. In those trials (3 and 4) in which sulphur fertilisation did not increase the yield, the proportion of soluble nitrogen of the total nitrogen was an average of 33 % with all treatments. In sulphur-deficient timothy the content of asparagine and aspartic acid totalled 60 % of the content of free amino acids, and their nitrogen formed about 17% of the total plant nitrogen. The corresponding figures with sulphur fertilisation were 39 % and 3.5 %, and in those trials where there was no sulphur deficiency (trials 3 and 4) on average 27 % and 2.5 %, irrespective of fertilisation. The proportion of soluble nitrogen of the total nitrogen of timothy was closely correlated (r = 0.79***) to the N/S ratio, as was the proportion of asparagine plus aspartic acid of the total free amino acids (r = 0.91***).",

Pysyvään maanviljelykseen ryhtyminen on ollut eräs ihmisen historian ratkaisevimpia käännekohtia. Kaiken kehityksen ja sivilisaation edellytyksenä on ravinnon ylijäämä, ja sen aikaansaaminen on ollut mahdollista vasta pysyvään maanviljelykseen siirtymisen jälkeen. Pysyvä maanviljelys syntyi ns. kuivalla vyöhykkeellä suurten, koskaan kuivumattomien jokien (Niili, Kaksoisvirrat, Indus ym.) tuntumassa ja perustui alunperin keinokasteluun. Härkien vetämä, maan pintaa möyhentävä aura tuli käyttöön jo kolmannella vuosituhannella e.Kr. sekä Kaksoisvirranmaassa että Egyptissä. Keski- ja Pohjois-Euroopan sivilisaation nopea edistyminen n. vuodesta 1000 j.Kr. lähtien sekä pitkällä tähtäyksellä lopuksi tekniikan läpimurto ja teollinen vallankumous perustuivat pohjimmiltaan kolmeen tärkeään tekijään. Ensinnäkin lauhkealla vyöhykkeellä voitiin maanviljelyksessä melko turvallisesti jättäytyä luonnon suoman sateen varaan, mikä ratkaisevasti vähensi maanviljelyksen vaatimaa työmäärää keinokasteluun perustuvaan viljelyyn verrattuna. Toiseksi keksittiin lähes nykyisen tyyppinen raskas kääntöaura, jolla Euroopan viljavat, mutta sitkeäpohjaiset joki- ja muut laaksot saatiin kynnetyiksi pelloiksi. Kolmanneksi keksittiin jäykät puiset länget, jotka nostivat hevosen vetokyvyn 4—5 kertaiseksi entiseen kaulahihnasysteemiin verrattuna. Kun härät korvattiin paljon nopeammilla hevosilla, voitiin asua entistä kauempana pelloilta yhteisissä kylissä, jolloin sivilisaation edellytykset huomattavasti lisääntyivät. Uudet menetelmät paransivat ratkaisevasti maatalouden tuottavuutta. Seurauksina olivat metsänraivauksen tavaton lisääntyminen, kaupunkien perustaminen sekä kaupan ja käsiteollisuuden ennen näkemätönkehitys. Tekniikka ja tieteet edistyivät uudella ajalla valtavasti, mikä johti lopulta teknologian läpimurtoon ja teolliseen vallankumoukseen. Teollinen vallankumous mahdollisti lopuksi maanviljelystöiden koneellistamisen ja tuottavuuden kohoamisen ennen aavistamattomassa määrin.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the frequencies of albina and xantha seedlings in an M2 generation of six-rowed Pokko barley treated with sodium azide, NaN3. The dependency of these frequencies on the harvesting method of M, plants is considered. The results demonstrate that \"one-grain-one-ear” harvesting in M, produced higher frequencies of both albinas and xanthas in M2 compared with an M2 originating from whole ear harvesting of M1. For albinas the difference is significant. In spite of the increased mutation rate, the laboriousness of the \"one-grain-one-ear” harvesting method restricts its feasibility in practical mutation breeding.",

Erityisen lämpimiä olivat kesät 1972 ja 1973. Tarkastelunkohteena olevat kasvukaudet olivat keskimäärin kuivia, vain kesinä 1967 ja 1972 ajankohdan normaalisademäärät ylitettiin selvästi. Kasvukauden sateet ajoittuvat kuitenkin usein epäedullisesti sikäli että alkukesä on kuiva, mutta korjuukausi sateinen. Korjuukauden runsaiden sateiden aiheuttamista puintivaikeuksista ja sadon laadun heikentymisestä johtuvia satotappioita koettiin tutkimusjakson aikana Etelä-Suomessa erityisesti vuosina 1972 ja 1974. Kasvukauden aikana sattuneiden hallojen aiheuttamat vahingot jäävät maamme etelärannikolla yleensä vähäisiksi. Vuonna 1975 esiintyi kuitenkin harvinaisen ankaria keväthalloja syysrukiin tähkälletulovaiheessa ja ne aiheuttivat paikoin satovahinkoja. Jakson aikaisimmat syyshallat koettiin vuosina 1966 ja 1976. Nekin sattuivat kuitenkin vasta elokuun lopulla ja syyskuun alussa eivätkä siten Tikkurilan oloissa enää aiheuttaneet satovahinkoja peltokasveille. Talvehtivien kasvien kannalta vaikein oli runsasluminen talvikausi 1965/66, jolloin talvituhosienien aiheuttamat tuhot olivat yleisiä. Tutkimuksessa todettiin myös, että kylvöstä tuleentumiseen laskettu lämpötilasumma on kevätviljojen osalta tarkempi kasvuajan mitta kuin yleisesti käytössä oleva kasvupäivien lukumäärä.",

Various pretreatment methods and processing conditions were evaluated for different fish species. Processing equipment suitable for small scale canning stations was developed in the course of this study. The keepability of the canned products was followed by physical, organoleptic and microbiological determinations during a period of 18 months. The roach, vendace and whitefish preserves were of the types »canned fish in tomato sauce» and »canned fish in oil and its own juice» and the perch preserves of the type »canned fish in brine». Roach, vendace and whitefish were salted by immersing into 21 % brine for 4—25 minutes depending on the size of the fish and preheated by smoking at 90° C for 60 —120 minutes. Products of good quality were obtained from whitefish which was dried by cooking in oil at 120 °C for 3 minutes instead of smoking. The perch were cooked in 3 % and 4 % brine for 15—20 minutes depending on the size of the fish. The best time and temperature combination for the aimed F value 10 and for a product of good quality was 60 minutes at 115°C when using rotation. In organoleptic evaluation all the canned products were judged to be of good quality and there were no significant changes in appearance, texture, taste or aroma during 18 months' storage at room temperature. No microbial growth or swelling of the cans was detected during storage. Use of frozen raw material in canning whitefish had no detectable effect on the quality of the final product.",

The experiments started in mid June, when the age of the lambs averaged three months, and lasted to mid September. During that time, the animals received no supplemental feeds. The grazing density on the natural pasture was 1.5—3.2 lambs/ha and on the cultivated pasture 15—20 lambs/ha. The lambs on the natural pasture grew significantly slower (P &lt; 0.05) than those on the cultivated pasture. The difference in live-weight gain was especially marked in June and from the beginning of August. In lambs moved from the natural pasture to the cultivated pasture in mid August the growth rate was somewhat better than in lambs kept on the natural pasture throughout, but growth diminished in all the lambs in September. The slaughter criteria were also better for the lambs on the cultivated pasture than for the others.",

The average digestibilities of silage were 68.6 (I) and 69.3 % (II) for organic matter and 71.0 (I) and 64.4 % (II) for crude protein. The pepsin-solubility of crude protein was 85 %. The calculated energy value was 2.21 Meal. ME/kg DM, corresponding to 0.60 f.u./kg DM (f.u. =C.7 starch units), and the protein value 142 g DCP/kg DM. The amino acid composition of crude protein of both fresh and ensiled tops was better than that reported for beet tops cut at ground level. The composition changed very little during ensilage. Beet top silage is rich in all required minerals except phosphorus. The oxalic acid converts silage Ca and even extra Ca to an indigestible form, but does not impair the digestibility of Mg. The large amounts of K and Na raise the pH of urine to a high level. The trace element contents of beet tops are well above the established requirements for pigs and the excess is secreted in the faeces.",

Säilyvyyden ja maun kannalta optimaaliset etikka ja suolakonsentraatiot sekä marinointiaika 10°C:n ja 20°C:n lämpötiloissa etsittiin sekä pienille (10—40 g) että isoille (100—300 g) ahvenille ja särjille. Säilyvyyskokeet kestivät 6 kuukautta ja ne tehtiin pienestä särjestä ja isosta ahvenesta valmistetuilla marinadeilla. Marinointilämpötilan, lisäaineiden käytön, pakkausmateriaalin ja varastointilämpötilan vaikutusta tuotteen laatuun ja säilyvyyteen tutkittiin. Sopivat marinointiajat olivat 10°C:n ja 20°C:n lämpötiloissa isoilla ahvenfileillä 5 ja 4 vuorokautta, esikypsennetyillä isoilla ahvenfileillä 2 ja 1 vuorokautta, peratulla isolla särjellä 6 ja 5 vuorokautta sekä nyljetyllä pienellä ahvenella ja isolla särkifileellä 3 vuorokautta ja esikypsennetyllä pienellä särjellä 2 vuorokautta 10°C:n lämpötilassa. Varastoinnin aikana marinadien laadussa ei tapahtunut merkitseviä muutoksia. pH oli kaikissa valmisteissa alle 4.5 ja bakteerimäärät pysyivät melko alhaisina koko varastoinnin ajan. Heti marinoinnin jälkeen korkeammassa lämpötilassa marinoidut kalat olivat pehmeämpiä ja maistuivat voimakkaammin etikalta kuin alhaisemmassa lämpötilassa marinoidut, mutta varastoinnin jälkeen eroja ei enää havaittu. Ahvenmarinadeja pidettiin yleensä särkimarinadeja parempina. Etikan maku oli kaikissa valmisteissa hieman liian voimakas. Raakana marinoituja kaloja pidettiin heti marinoinnin jälkeen hieman sitkeinä, mutta varastoinnin aikana niiden rakenne pehmeni. Esikypsennys ennen marinointia teki kalat liian pehmeiksi ja helposti hajoaviksi. Säilytyslämpötilan ei havaittu vaikuttavan tuotteiden bakteerimääriin ja pH-arvoihin. Käytetyillä lisäaineilla, natriumbentsoaatilla ja p-hydroksibentsoehapon metyyliesterillä ei ollut vaikutusta säilyvyyteen.

By using modern selection indices one can breed directly for profitability. The profitability of breeding can be considered from the viewpoints of private breeder, nation or the whole world. The national viewpoint deserves the main attention. The all costs and returns, as well as a long enough perspective can be considered. A private member of A.I. society is interested in immediate utilization of good males, not so much in investing money to get the males tested. The annual net profit from a daughter of a top bull may be 300 Fmk above the herd average. Investing money in to testing bulls is very profitable for the society. In Finland (750 000 dairy cows) the daughters of selected A.I. bulls can produce an additional profit of 112 mill. Fmk as compared to average bulls. The testing costs are less than 10 % of this. This rough calculation is supported by several more detailed studies from abroad. The annual genetic change in milk yield has recently been about 1% per year, which in the Finnish cow population means a net profit of about 30 mill. Fmk to producers. The total change from 1913 to 1977 has been about 50 %, i.e. today about 1 milliard Fmk/year. Thus, the milk price is 0.70 Fmk/kg lower than the present total income to producers would presuppose incase the genetic level would not have changed since 1913.",

The experiment has run for 4 years (1973 —1976). Two parallels have been used for each treatment. A third parallel without crop has been used for soil sampling only. The second experiment has run for 3 years (1974 —1976), and has included the same soil types and lime rates, but only cadmium and mercury of the metals. The crop grown in all years has been oats. 250 mg/pot of all metals except lead have had a distinct yield reducing effect. In the case of mercury, the reducing effect ceases from the third year. It decreases gradually after nickel throughout the experimental period, but not after cadmium and cobalt. Heavy liming (pH 6—7) has almost eliminated the yield reduction after nickel, and has considerably reduced it after cobalt. The contents of cadmium, nickel, cobalt, and mercury in the yield have been multiplied with the application of 250 mg/pot of the metals mentioned. Application of even 0.5 mg/pot of cadmium resulted in a distinct increase of content both in grain and straw. 0.5 and 5 mg mercury, however, had only slight effect. The content of the metals decreased throughout the experimental period. The effect of mercury in the fourth year has been minimal, even after the highest application rate. Lead application led to only moderate increase in the content of the yield. Roughly 45—55 percent of the added rates of cadmium, nickel and cobalt, as a mean value for the soil series, has been recovered as AL-soluble at light liming with pH approximately 5. Heavy liming has reduced the uptake by 3—7 percent for cadmium, by 16—20 percent for nickel, and by 22—24 percent for cobalt. Generally, the amounts of AL-soluble metal in soils have decreased in the order: series peat &gt; sand &gt; clay.",

The treatment lasted at the most 60 sec and was followed by an immediate chilling process. The aim of the treatment was to suppress the excess of a-amylase activity in the outer layers of the kernels. The changes in the quality of the rye were determined by the falling number test, amylograph test and baking tests in which yeast and no acid was added. All the performed treatments affected the results of the quality determinations. Treatment at 80, 90 and 100°C lasting 30 sec raised the falling number values to 102, 117 and 155, respectively. After treatment for 60 sec the values were 101, 142 and 223. In the amylograms the peak viscosity increased markedly. Processing at 100 and 90°C for more than 20 sec resulted in an increase of the peak viscosity beyond 1000 B.U. The peak temperature of all the samples was rather low and some decrease in the peak temperature was indicated at the processing temperatures of 80 and 90° C. The loaf volumes of loaf made from the treated samples were all lower than the volume of the loaf from the untreated sample. The samples treated for 30 and 60 sec at 100°C gave lowest volumes. Stickiness of the doughs was diminished by the more severe processing conditions, as also were dampness and elasticity of the crumb. All loaves except the ones made of grain heated at 100“C for 30 and 60 sec had a rather large cavity beneath the crust. The samples processed at 90 and 100°C for 30 and 60 sec gave a lighter brown crust colour than the rest of the samples.",

Some late varieties, e.g. Treeton, Tallarook and Esperance, produced very few seeds or no seeds at all. A considerable proportion of the seeds degenerated during the wet autumn conditions, by the end of October. Many seeds showed embryo dormancy, but complete dormancy or hard seeds were found only exeptionally. In spring 1988, some seedlings which had developed from overwintered burrs were found. There seems to be little hope of finding self-seeding subterranean clovers suitable for Finnish growing conditions.",

Over the entire experimental period, total dry matter (DM) yields for grasses, perennial and hay-suited annual legumes varied from 27.5 to 79.1, 18.8 to 40.3 and 40.5 to 50.5 t/ha, to which irrigation contributed 48 to 66, 50 to 57 and 56 % respectively. Irrigated grass crude protein (CP) contents averaged 5.3 and 9.9 %; and legume CP contents 16.1 and 18.8 % for the May and December harvests while rainfed grass CP contents ranged from 7.7 % (August) to 10.9 % (October), the corresponding legume values being 18.7 and 20.9 %. Irrigated cropping accounted for 55 to 56 % of the 9 207 to 12 461 kg/ha seed yield recorded in dual purpose legumes. It was inferred that on the basis of total herbage yield, distribution of yield and responsiveness to irrigation Pennisetum purpureum, Brachiaria decumbens, Cajanus cajan Acc UQ 50 or 3D 8104 and S. guianensis cv Cook proved to be promising; reasonable seed yield levels were obtained from C. cajan 3D 8104, Glycine max Acc. 49-14 and M 216 and Vigna unguiculata Acc Ivu 1283, whether irrigated or rainfed. The potential of irrigation is discussed in relation to feed, food and livestock production.",

Symptoms were expressed as grayish-brown necrotic areas on the lower leaves which killed plants from the seedling to heading stage, the effect being cultivar dependent. The proportion of plants killed contributed to the yield losses. The infection also resulted in less grains per panicle and lower weight of both panicle and vegetative above-ground biomass. From a total of 57 fungal isolates obtained from infected leaves, Fusarium culmorum (W.G.Sm.) Sacc. and F. sambucinum Fuck, dominated and subsequently caused infection (particularly foot and root rot) in oat in laboratory tests. These two Fusarium spp. were considered to be the primary causal agents of the symptoms observed in the field, although other pathogens may have been present. The disease was probably soil-borne. The results of this study suggested that the unusually dry and warm weather during late June and in July was the principal factor behind the severe disease outbreak.",

With an increase in nitrogen application, the total N in grains as well as nitrogen in the different Osborne fractions increased. The relative amounts of protein fractions changed: prolamin increased, glutelin remained fairly constant, and salt-soluble fraction decreased. The preceeding leguminous crops, pea and field bean, increased the nitrogen content in barley as well as the proportion of prolamin N. The share of prolamin N in barley following leguminous plants was higher than in barley following oats, where the similar total N content was due to fertilizer nitrogen. In mixed cropping of barley and field beans prolamin N in harvested barley grains also increased with the increased total nitrogen due to an increase either in fertilizer application or in the share of field bean in the mixture. In this case there was no clear difference in the proportions of prolamin N between the treatments. The proportions of salt-soluble fractions were slightly higher and that of storage protein lower in Finnish barleys studied than in the results from other studies, where Central European cultivars with larger grains were used.",

The effects of covering mulch and short day treatment of seedlings were studied also. First harvests were performed when field measurements showed that the greatest width of ‘ZEFA-Fino’ bulbs were on average 60 mm. Three harvests were then performed at one week intervals. Plant and bulb weights, bulb greatest width and thickness and, the heights of plant, bulb and stem inside the bulb was measured. The number of bolters were recorded. The bulb width of ‘ZEFA-Fino’ reached 60 mm in 1.5—2 months after planting out depending on planting date. Plant and bulb weights, bulb width and thickness, stem height inside the bulb and the bulb height in the earliest plantings increased as the growth period lengthened. The bulb width of ‘ZEFA-Fino’ was in higher correlation with bulb weight than bulb thickness or height. The ratio between the height of stem inside the bulb and bulb height increased fastest in the lot planted under cover in May and in the lot planted out in June; at the fourth harvest the relationship was 0.8. The largest number of bolters (8 %) was found in the latter lot. The yield estimate for ‘ZEFA-Fino’ at the third and fourth harvest was 170—360 kg/are depending on planting date and length of the growing season. All lots of ‘ZEFA-Tardo’ except that planted in July bolted quickly after the bulb width had grown to 60—70 mm. The yield quality of ‘ZEFA-Tardo’ was low because of elongated bulbs and great variation in bulb height. Short day treatment (dark period 16 h) of the seedlings retarded but did not inhibit bolting of ‘ZEFA-Tardo’.",

Hän toimi aluksi Etelä-Pohjanmaalla maanviljelyskonsulenttina, pika-asutustoimikunnan jäsenenä ja maanviljelyskoulun opettajana, mutta alkoi samalla suuntautua kotieläintieteisiin päin, suorittaen kandidaatintutkinnon laudatur-oppimäärän kotieläintieteessä 1946. Samana vuonna hän siirtyi maatalousministeriöön kotieläintoimiston päälliköksi ja syksyllä 1948 silloisen maatalouskoelaitoksen (nyk. MTTK) kotieläinjalostusosaston vanhemmaksi tutkijaksi. Hän väitteli syksyllä 1952 tohtoriksi kotieläinjalostusta koskevalla tutkimuksella ja sai nimityksen erikoistutkijaksi 1959. Vuonna 1966 hänet määrättiin hoitamaan yliopistoon perustettua uutta professorinvirkaa, johon hänet nimitettiin seuraavana vuonna. Vuodesta 1954 lähtien hän oli jo toiminut yliopistossa dosenttina kotieläinjalostuksen alalla. Hänen pääasiallinen elämäntyönsä tapahtui siten tämän alan tutkimuksen ja opetuksen parissa, joissa hän virallisesti ehti toimia lähes 30vuotta. Ylipuolet hänen julkaisuistaan koski nautakarjaa, minkä lisäksi hän tutki sikojen, porojen, hevosten ja lampaiden jalostukseen liittyviä kysymyksiä sekä tarkasteli kotieläinjalostuksen yleisperiaatteita.",

Pyrkimys kansalliseen omavaraisuuteen sekä halu pitää kuluttajahinnat sen tasapainohinnan alapuolella, johon markkinahinnat johtaisivat, on nähty markkinamekanismiin puuttumisen syinä. Tähän ehkä voisi liittää hintastabiliteettitavoitteen. Varsin mielenkiintoinen on tällöin kysymys siitä, minkälaisia allokaatio- ja hyvinvointivaikutuksia kansalliseen omavaraisuuteen tähtäävään maatalouspolitiikkaan saattaa liittyä. Tutkielmassa tarkastellaan näitä allokaatiovaikutuksia hintasäännöstelyn ja kahdentyyppisen subventiojärjestelmän tilanteessa. Hyvinvoinnin muutosten osalta tukeudutaan kansantaloustieteestä tuttuun kuluttajan ylijäämän teoriaan. Tulosten osalta todettakoon mm., että partiaalisen tasapainon mielessä tuotantoyksikköä kohden laskettu subventio on allokatiivisesti neutraali siinä mielessä, että se ei muuta tuotantoyrityksen optimaalista kokoa. Sen sijaan yleisen tasapainon näkökulmasta yritysten lukumäärä kasvaa, mikä johtaa hintojen sopeutumiseen ja siten resurssien allokaation muuttumiseen ko. hyödykkeen ja muiden hyödykkeiden välillä. Tuotantoyksikköä kohden määritellyn subvention allokaatiovaikutukset ovat suuremmat. Partiaalisen tasapainon mallissa tuotantoyksikön optimikoko alenee subvention vaikutuksesta samalla kun yleisen tasapainon mielessä tuotantoyksiköiden lukumäärä kasvaa. Molemmissa tapauksissa hintasäännöstely yleisesti voimistaa allokaatiovinoutumaa. Lopuksi on todettavissa, että omavaraisuustavoitteita ei luonnollisesti voida ajatella saavutettavan ilmaiseksi, vaan siitä on maksettava määrätty hinta. Tutkielmassa eritellään juuri tähän tavoitteeseen tähtäävän politiikan kustannuksia allokaation ja hyvinvoinnin kannalta. Sen sijaan on selvää, että tutkielma ei pysty vastaamaan kysymykseen, kuinka suuri hinta kansallisesta omavaraisuudesta korkeintaan kannattaisi maksaa.",

In accordance with previous studies the results showed that over 90 % of the economic gain comes from the milk traits. In addition the study showed that over 10 % of the gain is due to the increased feed conversion efficiency, mainly in milk production. The beef performance test of young bulls accounted for only 1—2 % of the total economic gain. Therefore the test stations setup for this purpose might be more efficiently utilised by concentrating on measurement of feed conversion. The study also indicated that direct selection for feed efficiency in milk production would give appreciably higher gain even if it were done on the basis of only 5 daughters/ bull. In practice this might be accomplished by measuring the feed consumption of a limited number of daughters per young bull, 4-5 months after calving for about one month or by collecting 200—300 individual mid-lactational feed consumption records for daughters of young bulls.",

It discusses the feasibility of Markov Chains in modelling the structural change for forecasting purposes. Using macro and micro data the transition probabilities are estimated for the farms moving from one field area size class to another. The probabilities for transitions between herd size classes are also estimated for the dairy, pork and poultry farms using micro data only. Applying the obtained transition probabilities forecasts are made on the number of farms and their size structure at the turn of the century. The regional aspect is an integral part of the study. For this purpose the country is divided into four regions. The transition probabilities, estimated using data from different time periods, yielded divergent forecasts. Therefore, an attempt is made to examine qualitatively, employing basic microeconomic theory, certain causal factors which could have influenced the agricultural structure and its change in Finland and within its regions. A particular emphasis is given to various agricultural policy measures, including those under income and production policies.",

Puna- ja mustaherukkapensaita leikattiin käytännön viljelmillä huhti-, kesä-, elo- ja lokakuussa. Puolet kannoista siveltiin lisäksi Kankerdood-haavanhoitomaalilla. Vuoden kuluttua leikkauksesta pensaisiin jääneet kannot poistettiin ja niiden lahoisuus ja sienet määritettiin. Kokeet toistettiin samanlaisina kahtena vuotena, jolloin koe kesti kokonaisuudessaan kolme vuotta. Vuonna 1974 perustettiin Viikkiin mustaherukalle (lajikkeet ’Öjebyn’ ja ’Brödtorp’) leikkauskoe, jossa vertailtiin viljelyn perustamisesta lähtien vuosittaista syys- ja kevätleikkausta toisiinsa. Leikkauksessa poistettiin sadonkorjuuta haittaavat lamoavat oksat. Yleinen harmaahome (Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr.) oli yleisin sieni leikkauspintojen kuorissa ja mustaherukalla myös puuosassa. Punapahkasientä (Nectria cinnabarina (Tode) Fr.) esiintyi runsaiten lokakuussa ja vähiten elokuussa leikatuissa kannoissa.

The highest total yield of red clover-timothy was obtained at a low lime level (Ca1 = 12g /pot CaCO3). The yield of red clover alone responded to liming similarly. The reducing effect of N fertilization (2000 mg/pot N as NH4NO3) on the yield of clovers was greatest in the first growing season (cuts 1 to 4) without lime, and in the second growing season (cuts 5 to 7) with lime (Ca1 = 12g /pot, Ca2 = 24g/pot). Liming without N fertilization promoted the growth of timothy only in the two first cuts; N fertilization increased the yield at all lime levels. Liming increased the Ca content of clovers, but there were no differences between lime levels. Mg and K showed a decreasing trend. N fertilization did not affect the nutrient content of clovers. A good quality of clover yield reguired adequate amounts of other fertilizations than N. In timothy, the Ca content increased slightly at all lime levels; the N and K contents increased by N fertilization. The N uptake by red clover was highest at the Ca, level, by white clover and alsike clover at the Ca0 level. The proportion of clover was larger than that of timothy of the uptake of N, P, Ca and Mg. When N was applied, the uptake of K showed an opposite direction.",

Colonization of the aphid was slightly quicker on oats than on barley. The highest peak inside field cages was 305 aphids and in the open field 74 aphids per plant. On barley, the number of aphids was highest on var. Pomo and var. Pokko, six-row type varieties with the longest growth period. On oats the number of aphids remained lower on var. Nasta, an early maturing variety with strong straw, than on other cultivars. Excessive nitrogen either increased or decreased the peak number of aphids per plant, depending on the variety and the year. Over 40 % of aphids on oats fed on the lower base of the plant at or under the soil surface. On barley, aphids lived slightly higher, 30 % in the stem and 30 % on leaves. Dimethoate spray controlled aphids on the top of the plant but not those on the base and lower leaves. Its efficacy against aphids on the upper stem and lower leaves on barley was decreased when an increased amount of nitrogen was used. The percentages of parasitized and diseased aphids decreased after the use of dimethoate.",

EU-jäsenyyden myötä puutarhatalous kytkettiin aiempaa tiiviimmin osaksi maatalouden sektorihallintoa. Samalla kävi ilmeiseksi, että puutarhatalouden kannattavuusseurannan tilastoinnissa on puutteita. Tilastojen käyttökelpoisuutta heikentää mm. se, että puutarhatalouden yritysrakenne on hyvin monimuotoinen, mutta virallisissa tilastoissa puutarhayritykset käsitellään vain yhtenä tai kahtena ryhmänä. Tältä osin tilanne paranee vuoden 1996 aikana, kun Suomessa aloitetaan puutarhatalouden kannattavuuskirjanpito.

Five experiments were performed using a conventional total collection procedure, and test ingredients were substituted for 25-40 % of the basal diet. The nitrogen-corrected apparent (AMEn) and true (TMEn) metabolizable energy values of distillers’ dried grains (DDG) and distillers’ dried grains with solubles (DDGS) derived from barley, wheat and rye varied from 7.85 to 11.8 and from 7.98 to 12.0 MJ/ kg DM, respectively. The highest MEn values were observed in the dehulled barley-derived products. The digestibility of crude protein (CP) was 62-83 and that of carbohydrates 25-50 %, the latter being lowest for feeds originating from whole barley grain. The results indicated that distillers’ feeds derived from dehulled grain, especially barley, are satisfactory energy sources for poultry diets. Dried barley protein (BP 1, CP 38 %), oats protein (CP 44 %) and distillers’ solids (CP 58 %) from the integrated ethanol starch process, as well as dehulled barley and oats proved to be excellent energy feeds containing AMEn 14.9, 18.6, 15.0, 14.2 and 14.6 MJ/kg DM, respectively. The TMEn values for BPI and dehulled grains were 15.3, 14.4 and 14.8 MJ/kg DM. Supplementation with enzymes did not significantly improve the ME value of dehulled barley.

To the few breeds not yet investigated up to now in this respect belongs Finnsheep (F), and this substantiates the present attempt. The histological analysis was performed on skin sections taken by the biopsy method from 7 F of the Experiment Station Koluda Wielka. Upon fixing and staining skin preparations by the method generally applied, the microscopic examination of kinds of groups, number of primary (P) and secondary(S) follicles per 1 mm2 (nS/mm2 +nP/mm2) in all kinds of groups as well as density of follicles, i.e.nS/nP per 1 mm2, was carried out. In microscopic pictures of skin, documented by means of photographs, superiority of triple groups, the share of which amounted to 74.2 %, has been found. The share of quadruple groups was 11.4 %, of double groups 8.6 % and of hexal groups 5.1 %. The mean density of follicles, measured by the number of primary and secondary follicles per 1mm2 of skin, amounts to 14.1, which results from the share of 2.0 primary + 12.2 secondary follicles per 1 mm2. The value of the nS/nP ratio in particular groups was as follows: the highest ratio was for the triple group (6.0), in the double group it amounted to 5.8, in quadruple group to 5.6 and in the hexal group to 5.3. Thus, the mean density for this sheep breed amounts to 5.84. Differences in the above values between singles and groups appeared to be small and not proved statistically. The obtained results concerning the studied F skin traits are characteristics for the hair cover of longwoolled type.",

The expediency of the recommendation should be reviewed in the light of the latest studies on diet, blood serum cholesterol and mortality. According to this information: 1. The mortality of the population increases both at high and at low cholesterol levels. The U-shape (Fig. 1) illustrating mortality vs. blood cholesterol level is different for men and women. Hence, the optimum blood cholesterol range should be set for men and for women separately. The present target value, below 5 mmol/1 for the entire Finnish population, is not reasonable. 2. The trans fatty acids formed in the catalytic hydrogenation process of polyunsaturated fatty acids have an unfavourable effect on blood cholesterol and may contribute to the occurrence of CHD. Thus the Finnish recommendation to increase the use of margarines is not well-founded. There are considerably better alternatives on the Finnish yellow fat market (Table 1).",

The dominating strains were isolated, their heat resistance was studied in APT-broth, on APT-agar and in coarsely ground cured pork, and their growth after heating and effect on spoilage were followed in coarsely ground cured pork. The first signs of spoilage appeared in the surface layer of the products. The strains were coccoid lactic acid bacteria with counts ranging from 3,5 to 7.8 log cfu (colony forming units)/g. They survived only accidentally after heating for 15 minutes at 72°C in APT-broth. The core of the products contained only coccoid lactic acid bacteria or only pseudomonads or both as the main bacterial strains. The counts ranged from 2.6 to 6.0 log cfu/g. Most of the strains isolated from the core survived after heating for 30 minutes at 72°C in APT-broth in at least three tests out of six. The most noticeable result of the study was the occurence of heat-resistant pseudomonads in the core. It must be pointed out that all pseudomonads found survived after heating for 60 minutes at 72°C in APT-broth, and often after heating for 15 minutes at 72°C in coarsely ground cured pork (core 72°C). The cfu number of the two most heat-resistant streptococcus strains decreased only 1 log unit over 15 minutes at 72°C in coarsely ground cured pork. The numbers of inoculated pseudomonads decreased but those of streptococci rose by a maximum of 1 log unit when the experimental porks were kept at 4°C after heating. This indicates that streptococci and pseudomonads probably do not constitute a serious spoilage factor in cooked meat products, but spoilage is generally effected by bacteria which have contaminated the surface layer of the products after heat treatment.",

Firstly, the purpose was to study the behaviour of the falling number of rye during the growing season in South Ostrobothnia. Secondly, the aim was to study the effect of air temperature and precipitation on the falling number and to develop a mathematical model for predicting the daily changes in the falling number of rye. Falling number data was collected at the Research Station of South Ostrobothnia of the Agricultural Research Centre in 1975-1987. The varieties used in the study were Anna, Hankkija's Jussi, Sampo, Toivo and Voima. On the basis of the falling number measurements and the daily weather data, a dynamic model for predicting the daily changes in falling number of rye was designed. The most important independent variables of the model are maximum air temperature and precipitation. The dynamic model predicted most accurately the falling number of the variety Anna. The coefficient of determination was 0.81. The lowest coefficient of determination was 0.70 for the varieties Sampo and Toivo. The maximum falling number was high in the years with warm periods during the maturing of the kernel. The threshold was 23 °C. In these years the dynamic model was not capable of predicting the highest falling number. Moreover, the predicted decrease in the falling number was usually faster than the measured one. The low falling numbers in South Ostrobothnia were mostly not due to low maximum falling number but to the fact that the maximum was reached early at the milk ripening stage, and at that moment rye was too moist to be harvested. After the maximum was reached, the falling number started to decrease due to precipitation and/or temperature.",

A total of 1800 hens laying at 65% on an average (70 wks of age) were subjected to one of the following treatments: no rest (control, C) or feeding only whole-grain barley (WB) or fasting (F, Trial 1 only) until the rate oflay dropped to 0%, after which the birds were returned to the previous all-mash diet. The second laying period was six months. Egg production of the WB and F hens ceased within one week on an average and the birds were out of production for 10 days. Laying intensity during the second production period did not differ significantly between the treatments in each trial, but egg weight and daily egg mass production increased as a result of the rest treatments. The laying rest procedures reduced feed intake, improved feed efficiency and increased live weight significantly. Egg shell and albumen quality traits were significantly better in the laying rest groups than in the controls. Significant differences in performance and egg quality between the hybrids were mainly ascertained in Trial 2. The results suggest that a short laying rest is a feasible means of improving egg quality towards the end of the laying period. It can be accomplished successfully by feeding whole-grain barley.",

    "abstract": "Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is grown under a wide range of climatic conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the underlying physiological phenomena which affect the quality of grain yield. The aim ofthis project was to study the interactions between cultivars in theiraccumulation and relative concentrations of the different protein groups of storage proteins at various stages of wheat grain development. Yield components, protein quantity and the quality of flour were examined. The study was carried out at the University of Helsinki, Department of Plant Production during 1989-1990. The cultivars used were Heta, Ruso, Reno and Kadett. Innorthern latitudes the early maturity class of a genotype is an important selection criterion associated with good breadmaking quality. The short grain filling period leads to a high rate of accumulation ofhigh molecular weight glutenins, because it coincides with a rapid expansion of the endosperm in the middle of grain filling. The associated yield loss in these cultivars may be compensated by higher number of grains per ear. Therefore, selection ofproductive wheat lines with earlymaturity, high protein concentration and high relative amount ofhigh molecular weight glutenins, and high grain number per ear instead of high kernel weight may lead to more stable yield and improved breadmaking quality.",

Three piglets were sacrificed at the beginning of the trial to determine the content of liver vitamin A. It was found to vary between 7.3 and 10.2 mg/100 g fresh liver. There were no differences between the groups in daily gain,feed: gain ratio or carcass quality. A histological examination ofleg joints did not reveal an increased frequency of osteochondrosis in pigs fed with a high level of vitamin A. Growing finishing pigs, having adequate liver stores of vitamin A at 25 kg of live weight, grew without showing any visible signs of deficiency up to 100 kg weight with no vitamin A additions. However, the liver vitamin A analysis at slaughter showed that the recommendation for vitamin A in practical pig feeds should be higher than 1000 IU/kg.

    "abstract": "An increase in mean prolificacy is a goal for many sheep production systems, but it is also desirable that variation be minimized around the optimum value. Lambs born in litters of 3 or 4 can be reared with intensive management, but at higher input costs than for twins. Thus for a mean litter size (LS) goal of 2.0, producers desire the maximum possible proportion of twins with as few singles and litters of 3 or more as possible. Coefficients of variation for ovulation rate (OR) range from about 22 % for Romanov to about 40 % for Booroola Merinos; breed CV’s for LS vary less. The most uniform LS’s are achieved by populations with a uniform OR and high prenatal survival. Variability in Booroola populations results in part from segregation of a gene with large effect on OR, but variation is high within genotypes (FF or F+). Among breeds where high prolificacy appears to be inherited quantitatively, there are differences in variability, with Romanov quite uniform, Finnsheep intermediate, and D’Man more variable. The possibility of a gene with large effect in the D’Man breed, in addition to many favorable quantitative genes for prolificacy, has not been ruled out. In general, these three breeds (and some others) transmit their prolificacy additively, making it possible to choose a wider range of mean prolificacy values by crossing and backcrossing with such breeds than by use of a major gene such as the Booroola. Data on variability of first and later generation crossbreds between non-prolific and different prolific breeds are now available.",

Traits studied were milk production and a low heritability trait that is negatively correlated with milk production, e.g. fertility. The variable factors in the study were the number of young bulls to be tested, the number of daughters per bull in progeny testing, the number of tested bulls to be used and the weights for selected traits in an overall index of the bull’s breeding value. The influence of variable factors on genetic response in milk production and fertility was studied by calculating the average of real genotypic values on both traits for all cows born in the same year and having a complete first lactation record. This was done for a 25 year period. The population structure used in simulation was like the Finnish milk recorded Ayrshire population in which there are ca. 250000 cows. The genetic response in milk production was improved by increasing the selection intensity amongst bulls. The negative effect of selection for milk yield on fertility could be decreased by giving the fertility a larger indexed weight. If the milk production had a weight of 1 and genetic correlation between traits was —0.20 then increasing the weight of fertility from 0.1 to 0.3 did not affect significantly the response in milk production.",

Despite many econometric studies on supply elasticities in Finland, so far no coherent analysis covering all products has been made. This shortcoming is the background for this study. Ordinary least squares were first used to estimate the elasticities, but since the residuals were in many cases autocorrelated, autoregressive models were also applied. The fit of the models did not improve much, but the autocorrelation disappeared, particularly when second order models were estimated. The long term supply elasticities seem to be small in general, a fact which also corresponds to expectations and earlier studies. The estimation of cross elasticities was not very successful and only one or two variables in addition to the producer price of the product concerned, could be included in the models. The estimation of supply elasticities proved to be sensitive to the inclusion of a new variable or a new observation. This may be due to the small number of observations or due to the rapid change in supply conditions which may be difficult to explain by econometric methods.",

    "abstract": "The content of fluoride was determined with an ion-specific electrode on 59 samples of honey from 47 localities in Finland. The concentrations ranged from 25 to 550/µg/kg and the mean for all the localities was 85.7 µg F-/kg fresh weight honey. The concentrations were lowest in eastern and northern Finland, where the amount of fluoride in the soil is small, and higher on the coast and areas where more fluoride occurs in the groundwater and bedrock. However, the highest levels of fluoride in honey were detected in the vicinity of Helsinki and some other places where the amount in the groundwater is not especially high. The higher levels in some honey may be due to fluorides introduced into the environment by the activity of man. The effects of fluoride on human health are discussed.",

At least 450 different varieties consisting of about 50 grass species have been tested in variety trials, but only few varieties, all of northern origin, proved valuable.

    "abstract": "The effect of temperature on the severity of damping-off of sugar beet was studied under controlled conditions. The disease incidence increased with increasing temperature. When the time up to emergence in a finesand soil was characterized by low temperatures (8°C night, 15°C day), a period of 14—21 days immediately after emergence caused a strong increase in disease incidence. In peat soil, even 7 days was enough to initiate such an increase. In neither of the soils used did three days of high post-emergence temperature cause any marked disease increase. When the pre-emergence period was characterized by high temperatures (15°C night, 25°C day) the disease was at a high level and in the very fine sand soil could not be lowered by lower temperatures. In the peat soil, however, a constant, low postemergence temperature significantly inhibited the development of the disease. The possibilities of damping-off forecasting by comparing the disease incidence in pot experiments to damping-off in the field seemed rather limited. When the temperature is taken into account, a negative prognosis may be possible. The basis of such a prognosis is the determination of the inoculum potential of the soil.",

Vain kaksi hakemusta kuvasi selvästi uusia, ominaisuuksiltaan parempia kasveja. Toisessa oli Ti-plasmidivektorin avulla tuotettu hyönteisille resistenttejä kasveja (EP-A-142 924) ja toisessa protoplastifuusion avulla saatu herbisidille resistentti perunalajike (EP-A-192 279). Keksintöjen toteutukselle yhteisenä piirteenä oli se, että transformoidusta kasvisolusta tai geeninsiirron tuloksena muodostuneista kasvusolukoista ei yleensä regeneroitu kasveja. Patenttijulkaisujen selitysosissa oli kuvattu enemmän kasvikokeita, kasvien regeneroimia tai vieraiden geenien siirtoa kasviin, kuin mitä esimerkkien perusteella käytännössä oli totetettu. Tämä on toisaalta juuri se tapa, jolla laajat patenttivaatimukset pyritään perustelemaan. Vaikka kaikkia keksinnön yleisessä kuvauksessa esitettyjä sovelluksia ei olisi toteutettu käytännössä, sovellusten täytyy kuitenkin olla toteutettavissa. Keksinnön täytyy toimia siinä laajuudessa kuin patenttivaatimuksissa on määritelty, muuten patenttivaatimukset eivät ole hyväksyttävissä. Tässä tutkimuksessa läpikäydyn patenttijulkaisuaineiston perusteella kasvibiotekniikka on vielä suuressa määrin menetelmänkehittelyasteella. Tosin tutkimusaineiston keräysajankohdan jälkeen ala on mennyt huomattavasti eteenpäin ja yhä useammin päästään tavoitteeseen asti eli saadaan kehitettyä kokonaan uudentyyppisiä kasveja, joiden uusista ominaisuuksista on hyötyä viljelijälle.

Also investigated were the effect of different concentrations of alkyl aryl trimethyl ammonium chloride solution (Gloquat C) in preventing rooting through, and the use of a watering control device based on measuring radiation energy in field conditions. The experiments on growth medium revealed that all the growth media included in the experiment, i.e. sphagnum peat, peat/rock wool mixture (1 : 1),or peat/sand mixture (3 : 1), can be used for container-grown nursery plants if a base dressing is used with Nutricote(70), a slow-release fertilizer. The effect of slow-release fertilizer was better in peat mixtures, and this effect was especially clear when no base dressing was used. The use of slow-release fertilizer proved to be a good fertilization method in a capillary irrigation system. The fertilizing effect of Nutricote (70) given in the spring lasted until early June of the following year. Nutricote(70) was found to need a base fertilizer dressing. Abase dressing of 1.2 kg/m3 of a compound fertilizer (Turpeen Y-lannos; N 11 % P 10.5 %, K 18.3 %) with 1.5 kg/m3 of slow release fertilizer proved to be a suitable fertilization method for ornamental woody nursery plants in a capillary irrigation system. The tallest plants were obtained with a base dressing that was mixed with 3 kg/m3 of the slow-release fertilizer. Plants thus fertilized were, however, considered to be too large for transport and handling. The problem of a secondary root ball under the pot in sand beds was prevented by spreading 15 ml/m2 of Gloquat C on the sand surface. The capillary irrigation system and the automatic irrigation control worked well in experiments carried out under practical conditions. The potted nursery plants were kept evenly moist, and the plants grew to market size in one growing season.",

The main purpose was to find out the income and profitability distribution of the farms and trends of them during the last decade. In addition, the stability of the economic results of the farms in the different years of the research period was analyzed. Analyses were based on statistics of the Finnish book-keeping farms in the years 1976—83. To eliminate the problems caused by the changes in the sample of book-keeping farms, the final analyses were based on a subsample of those farms, where the data was available for all the years. The total number of these farms was 617. Farm family income and the coefficient of profitability were the economic concepts analyzed in the study. The latter one expresses the imputed wage of farm family and the interest claim for total capital as a share of net income. Distribution of farm family income and profitability and the shape and location of the distribution in each year was analyzed by several statistical measures. The shape of income and profitability distributions was quite skewed which is typical for farm income distributions in all countries. Income differences and changes of income distribution during the research period were analyzed in more detail by using fractiles, quartiles and deciles. Also Lorenz-curves were calculated from the data. The main conclusion drawn from the analyses was, that the relative income differences have not increased during the research period. On the other hand, it is worth while to point out that absolute income differences have nevertheless increased. Analyses concerning the stability of the economic results of an individual farm over the research period indicate quite big variation between the years. Only a half of the farms of the lowest quartile remain in this category in all the years.",

The present value of the implemented safety and health improvements rose to FIM 22 000 per farm in 1983. About FIM 17000 were due to the tractors, FIM 3 000 to the cow houses and FIM 2 000 to other machines and tools than tractors. The protective equipment of tractors caused the annual maintenance cost of FIM 4 350 and cow house FIM 650, if the interest rate were 10 %. The annual total cost was over FIM 6 000. The replacement value would have been about FIM 31 000 in 1983. If all deficiences still remaining in 1983 had been corrected at once, the total cost would have been about FIM 12000 per farm, which leads to an annual cost of FIM 3 100. As for still remaining deficiencies, the study suggested need for an annual cost of about FIM 1 500 due to personal protectors. Half of this sum was due to need for the acquisition of personal safety equipment for forest work. Correcting the safety and health deficiencies of the cowshed and agricultural machines would produce each an annual cost of about FIM 800 per farm. The present value of the labor protection investments in 1983 was FIM 22 000 per farm, and there still remained need to invest an additional FIM 12000 in order to eliminate the remaining deficiencies. So, the theoretical total of the annual maintenance cost would have been FIM 6 600—9 200 per farm depending on the interest rate.

Line 66 excelled line 88 in lamb survival, while line 77 was a little inferior to it. In fleece weights, line 66 was equal with line 88, but line 77 lagged 24 % behind. Both of the composite lines excelled line 88 in daily gain by 10 %, being rather similar to each other.",

    "abstract": "Micropropagation is an efficient means of producing pathogen-free Elatior begonias. However, the growth of the micropropagated plants can be too luxuriant, flowering is often delayed and the root collars remain thin, all unwanted growth habits in commercial production. To study the effect of growth retardants, an experiment was arranged in spring 1987, in which chlormequat and ancymidol were used on the micropropagated Elatior begonia ’Afrodite Limelight’. Both growth retardants were sprayed at three concentrations: 500, 1000 or 1500 ppm of chlormequat and 37.5, 50.0 or 62.5 ppm of ancymidol. Spraying was performed once, twice or three times. Plants not receiving any growth retardants were used as controls. The time taken to reach anthesis and the sale stage differed significantly between treated and untreated plants only in the begonias sprayed twice with 1000 ppm chlormequat, which reached anthesis one week later than the controls. Both of the growth regulators reduced the growth in height, and ancymidol also reduced the growth in width. The flower stalks were significantly shorter in plants treated with ancymidol or two or three times with chlormequat than in the controls. No differences were observed in the number of branches, flowers or flower buds, or in the diameter of the root collar. The greatest proportions of saleable plants were obtained by spraying once with 500 or 1000 ppm chlormequat or leaving the plants untreated. The concentrations of ancymidol were too high, since the plants treated with this growth regulator were extremely compact and unsaleable.",

The experimental flock consisted of 100 ewes progeny of Polish Merino (PM) dams and F1 rams: Finnsheep (F) x PM; there were also 32 purebred PM used as controls. The crossbred ewes, with 25 % of F genotype, had a much better reproductive performance (117 % vs. 96 % in the PM), mainly due to a much higher prolificacy (152.2 vs. 133.6 %) and improved fertility (by 3.1 %) and the percentage of lambs weaned (higher in the crossbreds by 3.4 %).",

    "abstract": "Between the ages of 3 1/2 and 10 months, 12 bulls took part in an experiment in which 1) Tower rapeseed meal or 2) urea plus rapeseed meal was used as a protein source in a diet based on dry alkali-treated straw. In group 1 the rapeseed meal composed 32 % of a concentrate mixture also containing barley, oats, molassed beet pulp and minerals. The average daily consumption of rapeseed meal was 1.2 kg/animal and it contributed 58 % of the digestible crude protein supply. In group 2 urea composed 2 % of the concentrate mixture and the average daily consumption was 84 g/animal. In this group urea contributed about 38 % and rapeseed meal 20 % of the digestible crude protein supply. The palatability of the concentrate mixture was good in both groups. The average daily intake of alkalitreated straw was 2.3 kg/animal or 0.77 kg dry matter/100 live weight kg. Treated straw was the only roughage received by the animals from the age of6 months. Up to that age the animals also received hay, on average 840 g per animal and day. The average daily live weight gain in group 1 was 1072 g/animal and in group 2 it was 1111 g; the carcass weights in the respective groups were 169 kg and 176kg, and the feed conversion rates were 4.08 f.u. and 4.16 f.u./kg live weight gain. The differences between the group were not significant (P &gt; 0.05). Almost all the animals showed pathological changes in their inner organs, which may mean that alkali-treated straw sounds not to be suitable as the only roughage source for growing bulls.",

In 84 soil samples, BMC7 amounted to 0—316 meq kg-1, being highest in the heavy clay soils and lowest in the non-clay soils. In different textural groups, BMC7 seemed most markedly to be dependent on the initial soil pH, followed by organic C or oxalate soluble Al, in the coarser clays also on clay content. The results evidence that in determination of lime requirement, attention should be paid to the capacity of soil acidity. In routine soil testing, detailed lime recommendations for various soil types are needed.",
