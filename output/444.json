    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought many unique pathologies, such as coagulopathy, prompting a desperate need for effective management. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) can cause various thromboembolic complications, especially in critically ill patients. The pathogenesis is likely due to endothelial injury, immobilization, and an increase in circulating prothrombotic factors. Data on treatment are limited, although prophylactic anticoagulation is advised in all hospitalized patients. Herein, we have comprehensively reviewed the current literature available on CAC and highlight the pathogenesis, clinical features, and management of CAC.",

    "abstract": "Statin therapy is generally well tolerated and very effective in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, regardless of cholesterol levels; however, it can be associated with various adverse events (myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and diabetes mellitus, among others). Patients frequently discontinue statin therapy without medical advice because of perceived side effects and consequently increase their risk for cardiovascular events. In patients with statin intolerance, it may be advisable to change the dose, switch to a different statin, or try an alternate-day regimen. If intolerance is associated with all statins—even at the lowest dose—non-statin drugs and certain nutraceuticals can be considered. This review focuses on the definition of statin intolerance and on the development of clinical and therapeutic strategies for its management, including emerging alternative therapies.",

    "abstract": "Despite treatment with statins, patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides remain at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Consequently, novel pharmaceutical drugs have been developed to control and modify the composition of blood lipids to ultimately prevent fatal cardiovascular events in patients with dyslipidaemia. This article reviews established and emerging lipid-lowering drugs regarding their mechanism of action, development stage, ongoing clinical trials, side effects, effect on blood lipids and reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We conducted a keyword search to identify studies on established and emerging lipid modifying drugs. Results were summarized in a narrative overview. Established pharmaceutical treatment options include the Niemann-Pick-C1 like-1 protein (NPC1L1) inhibitor ezetimibe, the protein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors alirocumab and evolocumab, fibrates as peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPAR-α) activators, and the omega-3 fatty acid icosapent ethyl. Statins are recommended as the first-line therapy for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention in patients with hypercholesterinaemia and hypertriglyceridemia. For secondary prevention in hypercholesterinaemia, second-line options such as statin add-on or statin-intolerant treatments are ezetimibe, alirocumab and evolocumab. For secondary prevention in hypertriglyceridemia, second-line options such as statin add-on or statin-intolerant treatments are icosapent ethyl and fenofibrate. Robust data for these add-on therapeutics in primary cardiovascular prevention remains scarce. Recent biotechnological advances have led to the development of innovative small molecules (bempedoic acid, lomitapide, pemafibrate, docosapentaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acid), antibodies (evinacumab), antisense oligonucleotides (mipomersen, volanesorsen, pelcarsen, olezarsen), small interfering RNA (inclisiran, olpasiran), and gene therapies for patients with dyslipidemia. These molecules specifically target new cellular pathways, such as the adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (bempedoic acid), PCSK9 (inclisiran), angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3: evinacumab), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP: lomitapide), apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB-100: mipomersen), apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC-III: volanesorsen, olezarsen), and lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a): pelcarsen, olpasiran). The authors are hopeful that the development of new treatment modalities alongside new therapeutic targets will further reduce patients' risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Apart from statins, data on new drugs' use in primary cardiovascular prevention remain scarce. For their swift adoption into clinical routine, these treatments must demonstrate safety and efficacy as well as cost-effectiveness in randomized cardiovascular outcome trials.",

    "abstract": "Around one-quarter of all patients undergoing cardiac procedures, particularly those on cardiopulmonary bypass, develop cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI). This complication increases the risk of several serious morbidities and of mortality, representing a significant burden for both patients and the healthcare system. Patients with diminished kidney function before surgery, such as those with chronic kidney disease, are at heightened risk of developing CSA-AKI and have poorer outcomes than patients without preexisting kidney injury who develop CSA-AKI. Several mechanisms are involved in the development of CSA-AKI; injury is primarily thought to result from an amplification loop of inflammation and cell death, with complement and immune system activation, cardiopulmonary bypass, and ischemia-reperfusion injury all contributing to pathogenesis. At present there are no effective, targeted pharmacological therapies for the prevention or treatment of CSA-AKI, although several preclinical trials have shown promise, and clinical trials are under way. Progress in the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of CSA-AKI is needed to improve the development of successful strategies for its prevention, management, and treatment. In this review, we outline our current understanding of CSA-AKI development and management strategies and discuss potential future therapeutic targets under investigation.",

Edoxaban is a P-gp substrate, and several cardiovascular (CV) drugs have the potential to inhibit P-gp and increase drug exposure.To assess the potential pharmacokinetic interactions of edoxaban and 6 cardiovascular drugs used in the management of AF and known P-gp substrates/inhibitors.Drug-drug interaction studies with edoxaban and CV drugs with known P-gp substrate/inhibitor potential were conducted in healthy subjects. In 4 crossover, 2-period, 2-treatment studies, subjects received edoxaban 60 mg alone and coadministered with quinidine 300 mg (n = 42), verapamil 240 mg (n = 34), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 32), or dronedarone 400 mg (n = 34). Additionally, edoxaban 60 mg alone and coadministered with amiodarone 400 mg (n = 30) or digoxin 0.25 mg (n = 48) was evaluated in a single-sequence study and 2-cohort study, respectively.Edoxaban exposure measured as area under the curve increased for concomitant administration of edoxaban with quinidine (76.7 %), verapamil (52.7 %), amiodarone (39.8 %), and dronedarone (84.5 %), and exposure measured as 24-h concentrations for quinidine (11.8 %), verapamil (29.1 %), and dronedarone (157.6 %) also increased. Administration of edoxaban with amiodarone decreased the 24-h concentration for edoxaban by 25.7 %. Concomitant administration with digoxin or atorvastatin had minimal effects on edoxaban exposure.Coadministration of the P-gp inhibitors quinidine, verapamil, and dronedarone increased edoxaban exposure. Modest/minimal effects were observed for amiodarone, atorvastatin, and digoxin.",

    "abstract": "Activated charcoal is commonly used to manage overdose or accidental ingestion of medicines. This study evaluated the effect of activated charcoal on apixaban exposure in human subjects.This was an open-label, three-treatment, three-period, randomized, crossover study of single-dose apixaban (20 mg) administered alone and with activated charcoal given at 2 or 6 h post-dose to healthy subjects. Blood samples for assay of plasma apixaban concentration were collected up to 72 h post-dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCINF), and terminal half-life (T½), were derived from apixaban plasma concentration-time data. A general linear mixed-effect model analysis of Cmax and AUCINF was performed to estimate the effect of activated charcoal on apixaban exposure.A total of 18 subjects were treated and completed the study. AUCINF for apixaban without activated charcoal decreased by 50 and 28%, respectively, when charcoal was administered at 2 and 6 h post-dose. Apixaban Cmax and Tmax were similar across treatments. The mean T½ for apixaban alone (13.4 h) decreased to ~5 h when activated charcoal was administered at 2 or 6 h post-dose. Overall, apixaban was well tolerated in this healthy population, and most adverse events were consistent with the known profile of activated charcoal.Administration of activated charcoal up to 6 h after apixaban reduced apixaban exposure and facilitated the elimination of apixaban. These results suggest that activated charcoal may be useful in the management of apixaban overdose or accidental ingestion.",

In addition to TG-lowering effects, IPE also reduces non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels without significantly increasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with very high TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (MARINE study) and in patients with well-controlled LDL-C and residually high TG levels 200-500 mg/dL (ANCHOR study). This analysis examined the effect of IPE on inflammatory markers in patients from MARINE and ANCHOR.MARINE (N = 229) and ANCHOR (N = 702) were Phase III, double-blind studies that randomized hypertriglyceridemic patients to IPE 4 g/day, 2 g/day, or placebo. This analysis assessed the median placebo-adjusted percentage change from baseline in markers representing various stages of atherosclerotic inflammation such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).Compared to placebo, IPE 4 g/day significantly decreased Ox-LDL (13 %, p < 0.0001, ANCHOR), Lp-PLA(2) (14 %, p < 0.001, MARINE; 19 %, p < 0.0001, ANCHOR), and hsCRP levels (36 %, p < 0.01, MARINE; 22 %, p < 0.001, ANCHOR), but did not significantly change ICAM-1 and IL-6 levels.

GSK2798745 was administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled study design to healthy volunteers in three separate cohorts as single escalating doses, with and without food, and as once-daily repeat doses for up to 14 days, respectively. Two cohorts of subjects with mild to moderate heart failure were also administered GSK2798745 once daily for up to 7 days. Safety, tolerability, and systemic exposure data were collected. No significant safety issues or serious adverse events were observed with GSK2798745 in healthy volunteers and patients with heart failure. GSK2798745 systemic exposure data demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics up to 12.5 mg, less than twofold accumulation with once-daily dosing, and a systemic half-life of ~ 13 h.

With the advent of a wide variety of excellent drugs for the treatment of antihypertension, β-blockers have been relegated from the first-line treatment of essential hypertension. However, they remain the drugs of first choice in recommendations from the respective medical societies for heart failure, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation as well as in hypertension complicated with heart failure, angina pectoris, or prior myocardial infarction. When indicated, cardioselective β-blockers should be prescribed in patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We review the available evidence for the use of β-blockers in clinical conditions in which recommendations can be made for everyday practice.",

    "abstract": "Arterial hypertension is the main preventable cause of premature mortality worldwide. Across Latin America, hypertension has an estimated prevalence of 25.5–52.5%, although many hypertensive patients remain untreated. Appropriate treatment, started early and continued for the remaining lifespan, significantly reduces the risk of complications and mortality. All international and most regional guidelines emphasize a central role for renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) in antihypertensive treatment. The two main RAASi options are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Although equivalent in terms of blood pressure reduction, ACEis are preferably recommended by some guidelines to manage other cardiovascular comorbidities, with ARBs considered as an alternative when ACEis are not tolerated. This review summarizes the differences between ACEis and ARBs and their place in the international guidelines. It provides a critical appraisal of the guidelines based on available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, especially considering that hypertensive patients in daily practice often have other comorbidities. The observed differences in cardiovascular and renal outcomes in RCTs may be attributed to the different mechanisms of action of ACEis and ARBs, including increased bradykinin levels, potentiated bradykinin response, and stimulated nitric oxide production with ACEis. It may therefore be appropriate to consider ACEis and ARBs as different antihypertensive drugs classes within the same RAASi group. Although guideline recommendations only differentiate between ACEis and ARBs in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, clinical evidence suggests that ACEis provide benefits in many hypertensive patients, as well as those with other cardiovascular conditions.",

Although randomized controlled trial data are available to support the combination of two therapies, data regarding triple combination therapy are few.The phase III GRIPHON trial enrolled 1156 patients with PAH, including 376 receiving background double combination therapy. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of selexipag as a third agent in these patients and further analyzed this subgroup according to symptom burden at baseline as indicated by World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC).In this post hoc analysis, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional-hazard models to determine response to selexipag versus placebo on the composite primary endpoint of morbidity/mortality. Baseline characteristics and adverse events were summarized descriptively.Of 376 patients receiving background endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) therapy, 115 had WHO FC II symptoms and 255 had WHO FC III symptoms at baseline. The impact on the primary endpoint of adding selexipag versus placebo to double combination therapy was consistent with the effect in the overall population (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.44-0.90) as well as in patients with WHO FC II and III symptoms. Compared with the overall population, discontinuations due to an adverse event were higher when selexipag was added to background double combination therapy; no safety concerns were identified.The addition of selexipag to background double combination therapy with an ERA and PDE-5i provides an incremental benefit similar to that seen in the overall population, including in patients with WHO FC II or III symptoms at baseline.

    "abstract": "Omega-3 fatty acid products are available as prescription formulations (icosapent ethyl, omega-3-acid ethyl esters, omega-3-acid ethyl esters A, omega-3-carboxylic acids) and dietary supplements (predominantly fish oils). Most dietary supplements and all but one prescription formulation contain mixtures of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Products containing both EPA and DHA may raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In clinical trials, the EPA-only prescription product, icosapent ethyl, did not raise LDL-C compared with placebo. To correct a common misconception, it is important to note that omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplements are not US FDA–approved over-the-counter drugs and are not required to demonstrate safety and efficacy prior to marketing. Conversely, prescription products are supported by extensive clinical safety and efficacy investigations required for FDA approval and have active and ongoing safety monitoring programs. While omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplements may have a place in the supplementation of diet, they generally contain lower levels of EPA and DHA than prescription products and are not approved or intended to treat disease. Perhaps due to the lack of regulation of dietary supplements, EPA and DHA levels may vary widely within and between brands, and products may also contain unwanted cholesterol or fats or potentially harmful components, including toxins and oxidized fatty acids. Accordingly, omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplements should not be substituted for prescription products. Similarly, prescription products containing DHA and EPA should not be substituted for the EPA-only prescription product, as DHA may raise LDL-C and thereby complicate the management of patients with dyslipidemia.",

    "abstract": "Combination therapy is now regarded as the standard of care in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and is becoming widely used in clinical practice. Given the inherent complexities of combining medications, there is a need for practical advice on implementing this treatment strategy in the clinic. Drawing on our experience and expertise, within this review, we discuss some of the challenges associated with administration of combination therapy in PAH and how these can be addressed in the clinic. Despite their differing modes of action, all of the currently available classes of PAH therapy induce systemic vasodilation. In initial combination therapy regimens in particular, this may lead to additive side effects and reduced tolerability compared with monotherapy. However, approaches such as staggered treatment initiation and careful up-titration may reduce the risk of additive side effects and have been used successfully in clinical practice, as well as in clinical trials and registry studies. When combination therapy regimens are initiated, it is important that patients are monitored regularly for the presence of any side effects and that these are then managed promptly and appropriately. For patients to attain the best outcomes, the treatment regimen must be tailored to the individual's specific needs, including consideration of PAH etiology, the presence of comorbidities and concomitant medications beyond PAH therapy, and patient lifestyle and preference. It is also vital that individuals are managed at expert care centers, where multidisciplinary teams have a wealth of specialist experience in treating PAH patients. Adherence to therapy can be a concern in a chronic disease such as PAH, and as treatment regimens become increasingly complex, maintaining good treatment adherence may become more challenging. It is essential that patients are educated on the importance of treatment adherence, and this is a key role for the PAH nurse specialist. For patients who are managed carefully in expert centers with combination therapy regimens that are tailored to their specific needs, a favorable benefit–risk ratio can be achieved. With individual and carefully managed approaches, the excellent results observed with combination therapy in clinical trials can be obtained by patients in a real-world setting.",

    "abstract": "Inclisiran is a novel, cholesterol-lowering therapy, with a long duration of effect, administered every 6 months (subcutaneously by a healthcare professional). In the ORION-10 trial in US patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in addition to maximum tolerated statins, with or without ezetimibe, inclisiran demonstrated statistically significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of up to 51%. This is the first peer-reviewed publication to investigate the price at which inclisiran is cost effective in the US. The aim of this study was to determine the maximum price at which inclisiran is cost effective in addition to standard of care, in US patients with ASCVD, versus standard of care alone, at different willingness-to-pay thresholds. A lifetime Markov model from the US health system perspective, including 15 health states, was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of inclisiran. The following states were separated by time from a previous cardiovascular event (0–1 years, 1–2 years, 2+ years ['stable']): initial, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Additional states included revascularization and death (cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular causes). Baseline risk of cardivoascular events were from US database sources or published literature. Reductions in LDL-C from inclisiran were from the ORION-10 trial. LDL-C reduction was used to adjust baseline risk of cardiovascular events, based on established relationships between 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C and decreases in cardiovascular events, from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists studies. The population included adults with a history of ASCVD, and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite maximum tolerated doses of statin therapy. Inclisiran as an adjunct to standard of care, compared with standard of care alone. The threshold price of inclisiran. Inclisiran as an adjunct to standard of care resulted in threshold annual inclisiran prices of $6383, $9973, and $13,563 at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY, inclisiran had a 100% probability of being cost effective, with an annual price below $9000. At the publicly available price of $3250 per dose, inclisiran was found to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio just above the $50,000 per QALY threshold, of $51,686. This study identified the price at which inclisiran is cost effective for the US health system, at generally accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.",

Individualized adjustments in GDMT titration may be necessary based on patient characteristics, and every clinician is responsible for promptly initiating GDMT and titrating it appropriately within the patient's tolerance range. This review examines the current challenges in GDMT implementation and scrutinizes titration considerations within distinct subsets of HF patients, with the overarching goal of enhancing the adoption and effectiveness of GDMT. The authors also underscore the significance of establishing a novel management strategy that integrates cardiologists, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and patients as a unified team that can contribute to the improved promotion and implementation of GDMT.",

Patients with PAH have a deficiency of prostacyclin and prostacyclin synthase. Selexipag is an orally available and selective prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) agonist. Selexipag is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite ACT-333679, also a selective and potent agonist at the IP receptor.In this phase I study the pharmacokinetics (PK) and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of selexipag were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner in 64 healthy male subjects. An additional group of 12 subjects received an open-label dose of selexipag 400 μg in the fasted condition and after a meal.Maximum plasma concentrations of selexipag and ACT-333679 were reached within 2.5 and 4 h, respectively, with mean half-lives of 0.7-2.3 and 9.4-14.22 h. In the presence of food, exposure to ACT-333679 was decreased by 27 %. The most frequent adverse event was headache. Selexipag was well tolerated up to a single dose of 400 μg and multiple doses of 600 μg following an up-titration step. No relevant treatment-related effects on vital signs, clinical laboratory, and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were detected.Selexipag exhibits a good tolerability profile and PK properties that warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "While evidence in support of aspirin use in secondary prevention is well documented, the role of aspirin in primary prevention remains unclear. We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate aspirin use in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer primary prevention, and consider whether aspirin's role is set to become more clearly defined based on past and prospective studies.Utilizing PubMed, the reviewers identified appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms to establish CVD-based studies, cancer-based studies, and studies on adherence.Date restrictions of May 31, 2008 to May 31, 2013 were applied to capture the most robust meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials. Websites of relevant EU and US scientific societies were used to identify the key guidelines for aspirin use in primary prevention of CVD, and ClinicalTrials.gov was used to establish future or ongoing trials.Evidence in support of aspirin prophylaxis is conflicting, though some meta-analyses have underlined potential benefit in reducing cardiovascular events. Despite this apparent benefit, bleeding risk with aspirin is consistently higher versus control, and remains a concern. A reduction of cancer incidence and mortality after a least 3 and 5 years treatment, respectively, is also apparent with aspirin.Available data on aspirin in primary prevention suggest a modest benefit for patients at high risk of CVD, and a promising benefit for those at risk of cancer. Future studies should help to elucidate whether the benefit of aspirin outweighs risk in appropriate patient groups.",

This diversity and heterogeneity have added to the complexity of modeling the pathophysiological pathways that contribute to the disease burden. The development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting precise mechanisms within the underlying biology of HCM provides a tool to model and test these pathways. Here, we integrate the results of clinical observations with mavacamten, an allosteric, selective, and reversible inhibitor of cardiac myosin, the motor unit of the sarcomere, to develop an integrated pathophysiological pathway model of HCM, confirming the key role of excess sarcomeric activity. This model may serve as a foundation to understand the role of HCM pathophysiological pathways in the clinical presentation of the disease, and how a targeted therapeutic intervention capable of normalizing sarcomeric activity and repopulating low-energy utilization states may reduce the impact of these pathways in HCM and potentially related disease states.",

    "abstract": "Colchicine has been incorporated into major clinical guidelines for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, recent randomized trials have presented contradictory results. We aimed to synthesize the current evidence on colchicine in secondary CVD protection, using a cumulative-dose approach. We conducted a meta-analysis incorporating all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) globally. RCTs directly comparing colchicine versus placebo/standard care for the secondary prevention of cerebrovascular or coronary vascular disease were included. Odds ratios (OR) were derived for the primary outcome, defined as the prospective occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included mortality, individual components of MACE, C-reactive protein, and adverse effects. In total, 14 RCTs including 31,397 participants were included. Colchicine significantly reduced MACE (OR 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68–0.94) in both acute atherothrombotic CVD and all CVD (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.60–0.86) and resulted in significant prospective reductions in C-reactive protein. The threshold effect was apparent, with a protective benefit of colchicine against MACE at higher cumulative exposure ≥ 90 mg-days (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52–0.84). Colchicine resulted in no differences in cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular mortality. Colchicine significantly reduces MACE in both acute atherothrombotic and all CVD across multiple ethnicities, with a threshold protective effect that clinically corresponds to treatment with 0.5 mg daily for at least 6 months. Importantly, there was no signal of increased all-cause mortality. PROSPERO identifier no. CRD420251003142.",

    "abstract": "Preparations from Crataegus (hawthorn) have a long history in the treatment of heart failure. WS 1442 is a dry extract from hawthorn leaves with flowers (4–6.6:1), extraction solvent of ethanol 45% (w/w), adjusted to 17.3–20.1% of oligomeric procyanidins. Nonclinical studies show that WS 1442 has positive inotropic and antiarrhythmic properties and protects the myocardium from ischemic damage, reperfusion injury, and hypertension-related hypertrophy, improves endothelial functions such as NO synthesis, and delays endothelial senescence. Randomized, controlled trials in patients with heart failure have demonstrated that the herbal medicinal product increases functional capacity, alleviates disabling symptoms, and improves health-related quality of life, all of which have become important targets of heart failure therapy according to current disease management guidelines. Clinical trials (including a 2-year mortality study with polypharmacy and > 1300 patients exposed) and post-marketing surveillance studies have shown that WS 1442 has a very favorable safety profile both as monotherapy and as add-on therapy, where no drug interactions have been observed. No specific adverse reactions to WS 1442 are known to date. WS 1442 may thus help to close the therapeutic gap between systolic and diastolic heart failure for which evidence of efficacy for other cardioactive drugs is sparse. Scientific evidence shows that WS 1442 is safe and has a beneficial effect in patients with heart failure corresponding to New York Heart Association classes II or III. The benefit-risk assessment for WS 1442 is therefore positive.",

    "abstract": "SERAPHIN was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven phase III trial that evaluated the effects of long-term treatment with macitentan, an oral endothelin receptor antagonist, in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The majority of patients were receiving PAH therapy at enrollment, providing the opportunity to evaluate the efficacy and safety of macitentan in combination with other PAH therapies (predominantly phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors [PDE-5i]). In patients receiving background therapy, macitentan reduced the risk of morbidity/mortality by 38% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62; 95% confidence level [CL] 0.43–0.89; p = 0.009). Furthermore, patients receiving macitentan and background therapy had a 37% reduction in the risk of being hospitalized for PAH (HR 0.63; 95% CL 0.41–0.96) compared with patients receiving background therapy only (placebo arm). Macitentan treatment in combination with background therapy was also associated with improvements in exercise capacity, functional class, cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, and health-related quality of life compared with background therapy alone. The safety profile of macitentan as part of a combination therapy regimen was consistent with that of macitentan in the overall SERAPHIN population. The SERAPHIN study has provided evidence that combination therapy with macitentan and a PDE-5i is effective and well tolerated in the management of PAH. Based on these data, and those from subsequent long-term trials, combination therapy is increasingly recognized as an important treatment option for improving long-term outcomes in PAH.

The efficacy of MRAs for AF prevention in patients with HF and a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unclear. We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of spironolactone in reducing new-onset AF and recurrence of AF in 2733 patients with symptomatic HFpEF. Patients with and without prevalent AF at baseline were included, and those with permanent AF were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to spironolactone or placebo. The risk of new-onset AF or the recurrence of AF was quantified using hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). At baseline, 2228 (64.7%) patients had no history of AF (spironolactone, n = 1111; placebo, n = 1117), whereas 505 (18.4%) patients had prevalent AF (spironolactone, n = 260; placebo, n = 245). During a median follow-up of 3.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2.0–4.9), the incidence of new-onset AF was similar in both treatment arms: spironolactone 5.2% (n = 58) versus placebo 4.4% (n = 49); p = 0.41. The risk of new-onset AF was similar in both treatment arms: HR 1.19; 95% CI 0.81–1.74; p = 0.38. AF recurrence was also similar in both treatment arms during a median follow-up of 3.3 years (IQR 1.9–4.7): spironolactone 11.5% (n = 30) versus placebo 11.8% (n = 29); p = 1.00. The risk of recurrence of AF did not differ per treatment arm: HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.57–1.58; p = 0.83. Spironolactone does not reduce the risk of new-onset AF or AF recurrence in patients with HFpEF. This is in contrast to results in cohorts of patients with HF and a reduced ejection fraction. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier no. NCT00094302 (TOPCAT).",

    "abstract": "Previously, we have reported potential clinical benefits with the use of statins in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a meta-analysis, where there was a significantly reduced hazard for a fatal or severe course of illness with the use of statins, but the meta-analysis was limited by the small number of studies included, with small heterogeneity among studies, due to the unavailability of more studies at the point of literature search. We aimed to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence on the effect of statins on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, and preprint servers were searched (last updated June 3, 2021) to identify studies investigating the association between the use of statins in patients with COVID-19 and the development of severe disease and/or mortality. Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The outcomes of interest were (1) all-cause mortality and (2) a composite endpoint of severe illness of COVID-19. Upon systematic literature search, we identified 35 studies, of which 32 studies reported the outcome of all-cause mortality and 15 studies reported the composite endpoint of severe COVID-19 illness between statin users versus non-statin users with COVID-19. Our meta-analysis revealed that the use of statins was associated with a significantly lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.58–0.84, n = 21,127, and OR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.79, n = 115,097) and the composite endpoint of severe illness (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.73–0.88, n = 10,081) in patients with COVID-19, compared to non-use of statins, at the current sample size. Statin use is associated with a better prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Our findings provide a rationale to investigate the use of statins among patients with COVID-19 in large scale clinical trials.",

PER [an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor], IND (a thiazide-like diuretic) and AML (a calcium channel blocker) are well established antihypertensive agents, which have been available for a long time as monotherapies and dual SPCs and have complementary mechanisms of action. Once-daily PER/IND/AML provided effective BP control, with good tolerability, in patients with uncontrolled hypertension in clinical trials and in large observational prospective studies. The efficacy and tolerability of PER/IND/AML was similar to that of PER/IND + AML in a randomized clinical trial. The therapeutic effect of PER/IND/AML was associated with improved health-related quality of life. Thus, switching from the two-pill PER/IND + AML regimen to single-pill PER/IND/AML reduces pill burden and simplifies drug administration, which may improve adherence to treatment, leading to better BP control and clinical outcomes. Approximately one-quarter of patients with hypertension require three antihypertensive agents to achieve BP control. However, complex treatment regimens and high pill burden reduce treatment adherence, which in turn leads to poor BP control. Perindopril (PER), indapamide (IND), amlodipine (AML) belong to the core drug classes for the treatment of hypertension. These drugs have been available for a long time as monotherapies and two-drug single-pill combinations. Once-daily PER/IND/AML provides very good BP control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and is generally well tolerated. The single-pill PER/IND/AML has similar efficacy and tolerability to PER/IND + AML given as two separate pills. Therefore, switching from PER/IND + AML to PER/IND/AML reduces pill burden and simplifies the treatment regimen, which may improve adherence to treatment, leading to better BP control and clinical outcomes.

However, all oral anticoagulants carry a risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Although the risk is well documented and acute bleeding well codified, there is limited high-quality evidence and no guidelines to guide physicians on the optimal management of anticoagulation after a GI bleeding event. The aim of this review is to provide a multidisciplinary critical discussion of the optimal management of GI bleeding in patients with AF receiving oral anticoagulants to help physicians provide individualized treatment for each patient and optimize outcomes. It is important to perform endoscopy when a patient presents with bleeding manifestations or hemodynamic instability to determine the bleed location and severity of bleeding and then perform initial resuscitation. Administration of all anticoagulants and antiplatelets should be stopped and bleeding allowed to resolve with time; however, anticoagulant reversal should be considered for patients who have life-threatening bleeding or when the bleeding is not controlled by the initial resuscitation. Anticoagulation needs to be timely resumed considering that bleeding risk outweighs thrombotic risk when anticoagulation is resumed early after the bleeding event. To prevent further bleeding, physicians should prescribe anticoagulant therapy with the lowest risk of GI bleeding, avoid medications with GI toxicity, and consider the effect of concomitant medications on potentiating the bleeding risk.",

This meta-analysis seeks to explore the influence of SGLT2i on the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) following catheter ablation (CA) in individuals with T2DM qualitatively and quantitatively. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in electronic databases. Studies meeting predefined criteria were included. Individual patient data (IPD) were used from reconstructed time-to-event data to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for AF recurrence. IPD meta-analysis was followed by a direct meta-analysis to assess the risk of AF recurrence. A total of five studies [one randomized controlled trial (RCT) and four cohort studies] were included in this study, and five studies were included in the qualitative analysis, while four studies comprising 1043 patients with T2DM were included in the quantitative analysis. The pooled Kaplan–Meier curve based on reconstructed data showed a significantly lower risk of AF recurrence in the SGLT2i group compared with all antidiabetic drugs (log-rank P = 0.00011) and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitors (DPP4i) (log-rank P = 0.01). Cox regression analysis showed consistent results. Direct meta-analysis showed that SGLT2i, compared with all antidiabetic medications (HR 0.57, 95% CI [0.44, 0.73], I2) and DPP4i (HR 0.41, 95% CI [0.24, 0.70], I2), was associated with a lower risk of AF recurrence. SGLT2i are associated with a reduced risk of AF recurrence after CA in patients with T2DM. These results suggest that SGLT2i is promising in improving clinical outcomes for this population.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects as many as 1 in 200 people in the adult population globally. Patients may present with exertional dyspnea, presyncope or syncope, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, and even sudden cardiac death. Current guideline-based therapy involves medical therapy for treatment of symptoms in milder forms of the disease and surgical or catheter-based septal reduction therapies in obstructive HCM. Until recently, there has existed a gap between these two approaches that is now being filled by a new class of drugs, cardiac myosin inhibitors, which directly target the underlying disease process in HCM. Current investigations examine the effects of two cardiac myosin inhibitors on reported symptoms, echocardiographic evidence of disease, and the associated need for septal reduction. This paper reviews the contemporary evidence for the use of cardiac myosin inhibitors in HCM in adults and highlights future directions for this exciting field of cardiovascular medicine.",

    "abstract": "Elevated circulating cholesterol levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increase morbidity and mortality. Recent studies reported that PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) have a beneficial effect on various domains of patients’ lipid profiles and cardiovascular and mortality outcomes. Here, we aim to further investigate the efficacy and safety of PCSK9i in patients with ACS or who experienced recent episodes. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify all randomized controlled trials comparing PCSK9i versus placebo. Data were extracted and analysed using Stata/MP version 17.0. Eleven studies (n = 24,732) were included in this meta-analysis. In terms of efficacy outcomes, compared with the control group, PCSK9i significantly decreased levels of LDL-C, TC, TG, Lp (a) and Apo-B, with the following values, respectively: Cohen’s d of − 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI − 1.64 to − 0.87); Cohen’s d of − 1.32, 95% CI (− 1.83 to − 0.81); Cohen’s d of − 0.26, 95% CI (− 0.37 to − 0.14); Cohen’s d of − 0.70, 95% CI (− 1.15 to − 0.26); and Cohen’s d of − 1.46, 95% CI (− 1.97 to − 0.94). The levels of HDL-C and Apo-A1 increased by: Cohen’s d 0.27, 95% CI (0.16–0.39) and Cohen’s d of 0.30, 95% CI (0.17–0.42), respectively. Regarding safety outcomes, PCSK9i was associated with lower odds of myocardial infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular events with the following values, respectively: OR = 0.87, 95% CI (0.78–0.97) and OR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.52–0.98). PCSK9i was associated with better lipid profile and quality of life of patients and can be recommended as an optimal treatment strategy. Further trials should study combinations of PCSK9i with other lipid-lowering drugs.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining stable levels of anticoagulation using warfarin therapy is challenging. Few studies have examined the stability of the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who have had ≥6 months' exposure to warfarin anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Our objective was to describe INR control in NVAF patients who had been receiving warfarin for at least 6 months. Using retrospective patient data from the CoagClinic™ database, we analyzed data from NVAF patients treated with warfarin to assess the quality of INR control and possible predictors of poor INR control. Time within, above, and below the recommended INR range (2.0–3.0) was calculated for patients who had received warfarin for ≥6 months and had three or more INR values. The analysis also assessed INR patterns and resource utilization of patients with an INR >4.0. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with poor INR control. Patients (n = 9433) had an average of 1.6 measurements per 30 days. Mean follow-up time was 544 days. Approximately 39 % of INR values were out of range, with 23 % of INR values being <2.0 and 16 % being >3.0. Mean percent time with INR in therapeutic range was 67 %; INR <2.0 was 19 % and INR >3.0 was 14 %. Patients with more than one reading of INR >4.0 (~39 %) required an average of one more visit and took 3 weeks to return to an in-range INR. Male sex and age >75 years were predictive of better INR control, whereas a history of heart failure or diabetes were predictive of out-of-range INR values. However, patient characteristics did not predict the likelihood of INR >4.0. Out-of-range INR values remain frequent in patients with NVAF treated with warfarin. Exposure to high INR values was common, resulting in increased resource utilization.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension remains the leading cause of global mortality, with elevated systolic blood pressure (BP) leading to 10.8 million deaths each year. Despite this, only around 50% of individuals with hypertension are aware of their condition. Alongside low awareness rates, lack of patient adherence to medication and therapeutic inertia have been identified as factors contributing to the lack of hypertension control worldwide. This report summarizes presentations from the \"one of a kind\" Servier-sponsored symposium, Improving the Management of Hypertension: Acting on Key Factors, which was conducted as part of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)-International Society of Hypertension (ISH) 2021 ON-AIR meeting. The symposium focused on how low awareness, therapeutic inertia, and nonadherence can be addressed by combining the experience of a patient with the expertise of physicians. May Measurement Month, the ongoing global BP measurement program, is raising awareness of hypertension in over 90 countries, and the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines and the 2020 ISH guidelines now include recommendations that specifically address low adherence and therapeutic inertia, including involving patients in a shared decision-making process and the use of single-pill combination therapy. Understanding the role of emotion in decision making and addressing the different psychological states and attitudes in the patient's \"cycle of change\" are key to effective shared decision making and improving adherence. Raised blood pressure (hypertension) is involved in the death of around 10.8 million people throughout the world each year. However, only about half of the people with hypertension are aware of their condition. In addition, many patients who are prescribed blood pressure-lowering medications do not take their pills regularly (intentional or nonintentional low adherence). Many doctors are not as strict as they should be in ensuring blood pressure control of their hypertensive patients (therapeutic inertia). This report presents ideas and data from a \"first of its kind\" symposium sponsored by Servier as part of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)-International Society of Hypertension (ISH) 2021 ON-AIR meeting involving both patient and physicians. The report summarizes the ways in which low awareness, therapeutic inertia, and lack of adherence can be addressed and includes insights into patients' perspectives. An ongoing global blood pressure screening program called May Measurement Month was discussed, which has detected almost a million people with untreated or inadequately treated hypertension worldwide since 2017. Recent ESH and ISH guidelines for managing hypertension now include recommendations on how to address low adherence and therapeutic inertia. Crucially, doctors should involve their patients with hypertension in decisions about their own treatment, which will help improve adherence to medication and ultimately reduce hypertension-related serious adverse events (e.g. heart attacks, strokes and deaths).",

    "abstract": "Very short (≤ 3 months) duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (VSDAPT) has recently been proposed after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare very short versus > 3 months' duration of dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) in patients undergoing PCI with DES, focusing on ischemic and bleeding events. Three major databases (Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus) were screened for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary endpoint of our meta-analysis was the incidence of net adverse clinical events (NACE), as defined per trial, while secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, repeat revascularization, and major bleeding. We included eight RCTs with a total of 41,204 patients; 20,592 patients were allocated to VSDAPT and the remaining 20,612 patients were randomized to a longer DAPT period. The abbreviated regimen significantly reduced NACE (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.74–0.95) and major bleeding (OR 0.71, 95% Cl 0.61–0.82), without affecting mortality or ischemic events (stroke, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and stent thrombosis). VSDAPT significantly decreased the odds of NACEs and major bleeding by 17% and 29%, respectively, without increasing ischemic events. Thus, VSDAPT could be well tolerated and feasible after PCI with DES. Open Science Framework (10.17605/OSF.IO/4H2JB) Very short-term DAPT significantly reduces NACE and major bleedings, without affecting mortality and ischemic events (MACE, MI, stroke, stent thrombosis and revascularization).

    "abstract": "This article reviews available evidence regarding hypertension management in the Asia-Pacific region, focussing on five research questions that deal with specific aspects: blood pressure (BP) control, guideline recommendations, role of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in clinical practice, pharmacological management and real-world adherence to guideline recommendations. A PubMed search identified 2537 articles, of which 94 were considered relevant. Compared with Europeans, Asians have higher systolic/diastolic/mean arterial BP, with a stronger association between BP and stroke. Calcium channel blockers are the most-commonly prescribed monotherapy in Asia, with significant variability between countries in the rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and single-pill combination (SPC) use. In clinical practice, ARBs are used more commonly than ACEis, despite the absence of recommendation from guidelines and clinical evidence supporting the use of one class of drug over the other. Ideally, antihypertensive treatment should be tailored to the individual patient, but currently there are limited data on the characteristics of hypertension in Asia-Pacific individuals. Large outcome studies assessing RAAS inhibitor efficacy and safety in multi-national Asian populations are lacking. Among treated patients, BP control rates were ~ 35 to 40%; BP control in Asia-Pacific is suboptimal, and disproportionately so compared with Western nations. Strategies to improve the management of hypertension include wider access/availability of affordable treatments, particularly SPCs (which improve adherence), effective public health screening programs targeting patients to drive health-seeking behaviours, an increase in physician/patient awareness and early implementation of lifestyle changes. A unified Asia-Pacific guideline on hypertension management with pragmatic recommendations, particularly in resource-limited settings, is essential.",

    "abstract": "In this comprehensive state-of-the-art review, we provide an evidence-based analysis of current drug therapies for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the acute and chronic phases with concurrent hypertension. Additionally, we explore the latest developments and emerging evidence on the efficacy, safety, and clinical outcomes of common and novel drug treatments in the management of HFpEF with concurrent hypertension. During the acute phase of HFpEF, intravenous diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and vasodilators are pivotal, while in the chronic phase, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have proven effective in enhancing clinical outcomes. However, the use of calcium channel blockers in HFpEF with hypertension should be approached with caution, owing to their potential negative inotropic effects. We also explored emerging drug therapies for HFpEF, such as sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators, novel MRAs, and ivabradine. Notably, SGLT2 inhibitors have shown promise in reducing heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality in patients with HFpEF, regardless of their diabetic status. Additionally, ARNI and sGC stimulators have demonstrated potential in improving symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life. Nonetheless, additional research is necessary to pinpoint optimal treatment strategies for HFpEF with concurrent hypertension. Furthermore, long-term studies are essential to assess the durability and sustained benefits of emerging drug therapies. Identification of novel targets and mechanisms underlying HFpEF pathophysiology will pave the way for innovative drug development approaches in the management of HFpEF with concurrent hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a significant global health issue and is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Patients with CKD have an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolism (VTE). While direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become a standard of care for anticoagulation (AC) in patients with AF and VTE, the appropriate use of these agents in comorbid kidney impairment warrants detailed discussion. This scientific narrative review summarizes the effectiveness and safety of apixaban use in patients with renal dysfunction by assessing the current published pharmacokinetic, interventional, observational, and guideline data. Apixaban is a highly selective, orally active, direct inhibitor of factor Xa, with well-established pharmacokinetics and consistent clinical outcomes across a broad range of patient populations, including those with kidney impairment. Overall, the scientific literature has shown that apixaban has a favorable clinical efficacy and safety profile compared with vitamin K antagonists for patients with AF or VTE and comorbid kidney impairment. These data support the approved label dosing strategy of apixaban in reducing the risk of stroke/systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF and in treating VTE across all ranges of kidney function. Both clinician experience and knowledge of patient-specific factors may be required in the management of comorbid patients with advanced CKD or those requiring dialysis, as data on these patients are limited.",

    "abstract": "In the CLEAR Outcomes study, 13,970 high cardiovascular risk patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance were randomized to treatment with bempedoic acid or standard of care (placebo). Bempedoic acid reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 13%. However, the cost-effectiveness of bempedoic acid in this patient population is unknown. Markov modeling estimated cost-effectiveness of bempedoic acid versus standard of care alone to reduce cardiovascular risk from a US third-party payer perspective. Baseline risk was estimated by applying individual patient characteristics from the trial to established risk equations. Treatment benefit was extrapolated over a lifetime horizon using hazard ratios for individual major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) components from CLEAR Outcomes. Scenario analyses included on-treatment analysis, alternate bempedoic acid costs, and modeling effects of the fixed-dose combination with ezetimibe on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction and predicted MACE. Bempedoic acid was estimated to reduce lifetime MACE (1.58 versus 1.95 per patient) versus standard of care. At list price, bempedoic acid was associated with increased costs (+ $22,600) and improved quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs, + 0.14), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $166,830 per QALY. The on-treatment analysis resulted in an ICER of $70,279 per QALY. Reduction in bempedoic acid price by 25% resulted in lower incremental total costs and an ICER of $99,993 per QALY. Modeling the effects of the fixed-dose combination resulted in an ICER of $40,317 per QALY. Use of bempedoic acid offers improved lifetime cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction over standard of care in patients with or at high risk for CV disease (CVD) at common cost-effectiveness thresholds ($150,000 per QALY).

    "abstract": "Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) play a key role in hypertension therapy. Recently, fimasartan, the ninth ARB, was developed, but its safety and efficacy have not been well established.The objective of this study was to determine whether age, sex, concomitant disease, and current antihypertensive medications affect the safety and efficacy of fimasartan in patients with arterial hypertension.This was a large-scale, open-label observational study to determine the safety and efficacy of fimasartan in patients with hypertension. Patients who were treated for more than 2 months with fimasartan (60 or 120 mg, once daily) were recruited, and the data were systematically collected using electronic case report forms. Written informed consent forms were obtained from all patients.A total of 14,151 patients (50.7 % males; mean age 59 ± 12 years) were evaluated, of whom 37.9 % were never treated with fimasartan, 53.5 % were switched to fimasartan, and 8.5 % had fimasartan added to their treatment. Overall, fimasartan reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 145.4 ± 18.1 to 126.8 ± 12.6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 88.7 ± 11.8 to 79.0 ± 8.7 mmHg (all p < 0.001). The pulse rate decreased from 74.4 ± 10.3 to 71.9 ± 9.2 beats/min in comparison with before treatment (p < 0.001). The reductions were similar between sexes, age groups, and patients with and without co-morbidities, and were not dependent on prior or concomitant treatment with other antihypertensive drugs. Adverse events were reported in 3.31 % (treatment-emergent) and 2.35 % (drug-related) of patients; there were no dose differences for adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were dizziness (1.55 %) and headache (0.52 %); other adverse events were rare. The responder rate (DBP to <90 mmHg or a reduction of ≥10 mmHg) and the goal rate (combined SBP/DBP <140/90 mmHg) were 85.0 and 75.6 %, respectively. Global drug compliance was rated as excellent, very good, good, and poor in 68.1, 26.9, 3.4, and 1.7 % of patients, respectively.The safety, efficacy, and compliance of fimasartan were found to be excellent in a large patient population that included patients potentially at higher risk for adverse events.",

Although safe and generally well tolerated, there is growing evidence to suggest that statins are associated with an elevated occurrence of new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). Recent experimental and clinical data have prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to add information to statin labels regarding the increased risk of development of type 2 DM. The main purpose of this review is to critically discuss the clinical evidence regarding the association of statin use with new-onset DM, the CV benefit/risk ratio with statins, and the rationale for individualized statin therapy.",

    "abstract": "Adherence to non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) may be lower than to vitamin K antagonists because NOACs do not require routine monitoring. We assessed the impact of an educational program on adherence and persistence with apixaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Patients with NVAF eligible for NOACs with one or more stroke risk factor (prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, age ≥ 75 years, hypertension, diabetes, or symptomatic heart failure) were randomized (1:1) to standard of care (SOC) or SOC with additional educational (information booklet, reminder tools, virtual clinic access). The primary outcome was adherence to apixaban (2.5 or 5 mg twice daily) at 24 weeks. Patients receiving the educational program were re-randomized (1:1) to continue the program for 24 further weeks or to switch to secondary SOC. Implementation adherence and persistence were reassessed at 48 weeks. In total, 1162 patients were randomized (SOC, 583; educational program, 579). Mean implementation adherence ± standard deviation (SD) at 24 weeks was 91.6% ± 17.1 for SOC and 91.9% ± 16.1 for the educational program arm; results did not differ significantly between groups at any time-point. At 48 weeks, implementation adherence was 90.4% ± 18.0, 90.1% ± 18.6, and 89.3% ± 18.1 for continued educational program, SOC, and secondary SOC, respectively; and corresponding persistence was 86.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 81.3–89.7), 85.2% (95% CI 81.5–88.2), and 87.8% (95% CI 83.4–91.1). Serious adverse events were similar across groups. High implementation adherence and persistence with apixaban were observed in patients with NVAF receiving apixaban. The educational program did not show additional benefits. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01884350].",

    "abstract": "Vericiguat is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure in adult patients with reduced ejection fraction who are stabilized after a recent decompensation event. To investigate the effects of vericiguat on QT interval in patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS). This was a randomized, phase Ib, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter study. Vericiguat once daily was up-titrated from 2.5 mg to 5 mg and then to 10 mg (treatments A, B, and C) at 14-day intervals. Positive control was moxifloxacin 400 mg (single dose on day 8 or day 50; placebo on other days [treatment D]). We evaluated the placebo-adjusted change from baseline of the Frederica-corrected QTc interval (QTcF), pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of vericiguat. In total, 74 patients with CCS, with mean (standard deviation) age 63.4 (8.0) years, were included and 72 patients completed the study. At each timepoint up to 7 h after administration, mean placebo-corrected change in QTcF from baseline was < 6 ms and the upper limit of the two-sided 90% confidence interval of the mean was below the 10-ms threshold for clinical relevance. Moxifloxacin confirmed the assay sensitivity. Median time of maximum concentration of vericiguat was 4.5 h post-dose. The adverse event profile of vericiguat was consistent with its mechanism of action, and the findings did not indicate any safety concerns. As part of an integrative risk assessment, this study demonstrated no clinically relevant corrected QT prolongation with vericiguat 10 mg once daily at steady state. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03504982. Vericiguat is approved for treating worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. As part of the safety evaluation of vericiguat, this study assessed its effect on the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram measures electrical activity of the heart. The QT interval is the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave. A longer than normal QT interval indicates an increased chance for abnormal heart rhythms. Usually, a QT study is conducted at high doses in healthy volunteers. Previous studies indicated that high doses of vericiguat may cause increased changes in blood pressure in healthy volunteers. Therefore, this study was performed in patients at a normal therapeutic dose. Patients with chronic coronary syndromes were enrolled rather than patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, because they have fewer electrocardiogram abnormalities. The starting dose of vericiguat was 2.5 mg once daily, and the dose was increased to 5 mg and then to 10 mg at 14-day intervals. Placebo was tested for comparison and moxifloxacin (400 mg), a drug known to increase the QT interval, was tested to confirm that the study could detect a change in the QT interval. An increase in the QT interval of more than 10 ms was considered clinically relevant. Of 74 patients included, 72 completed the study. At each timepoint (up to 7 h after dosing), the difference between the QT change for vericiguat and placebo was less than 10 ms; therefore, vericiguat does not prolong the QT interval to a clinically relevant extent.",

    "abstract": "Finerenone is a novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist (MRA) with unique pharmacological properties that offer potent and selective blockade of the MR with a more favorable side effect profile than spironolactone and eplerenone. In a large phase III clinical trial involving 13,026 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a broad spectrum of chronic kidney disease, finerenone provoked a substantial placebo-subtracted reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HF). These preliminary clinical trial data, along with the ongoing uncertainty about the safety and efficacy of MR antagonism in patients with HF and higher levels of ejection fraction have provided the rationale for the design of the FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure) trial. In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, phase III trial involving 6001 patients with HF and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, finerenone was superior to placebo in improving the primary composite outcome of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and death from cardiovascular causes. This benefit was similar in magnitude in patients receiving and in patients not receiving background treatment with a sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitor, suggesting a potential additive benefit with combination therapy. We explore the emerging role of the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone as a new therapeutic opportunity to improve the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HF and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. We discuss preliminary clinical trial data and provide a critical evaluation of the main results of the FINEARTS-HF trial.",

    "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events; reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), the primary target for cholesterol-lowering therapy, lowers the risk for such events. Although bile acid sequestrants were the first class of drugs to show a mortality benefit related to LDL-C lowering, statins are now considered first-line pharmacological therapy for reducing LDL-C levels because of their potency and their remarkable record of successful outcomes studies. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of patients do not achieve LDL-C goals with statin monotherapy. In addition, because of adverse effects (primarily myopathy), some patients may be unwilling to use or unable to tolerate statin therapy at all or may not tolerate a full therapeutic statin dose. Also, statins may increase risk of new-onset diabetes in patients at high risk for diabetes. Thus, there remains a need for other lipid-lowering drugs to be used in combination with or in place of statins. The purpose of this article is to review available data from the literature on the use of colesevelam, a second-generation bile acid sequestrant, in combination with other lipid-lowering agents. Colesevelam has been studied in combination with statins, niacin, fibrates, and ezetimibe (including some three-drug combinations). An additive reduction in LDL-C was seen with all combinations. Other observed effects of colesevelam in combination with other lipid-lowering drugs include reductions in apolipoprotein (apo) B (with statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, statin plus niacin, or statin plus ezetimibe) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (with statins), and increases in apo A-I (with statins, ezetimibe, or statins plus niacin). Triglyceride levels remained relatively unchanged when colesevelam was combined with statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, or statin plus ezetimibe, and decreased with the triple combination of colesevelam, statin, and niacin. Colesevelam offset the negative glycemic effects of statins and niacin in subjects with insulin resistance or impaired glucose tolerance. Colesevelam was generally well tolerated when added to other lipid-lowering therapies in clinical trials, with gastrointestinal effects such as constipation being the predominant adverse events. Since colesevelam is not absorbed and works primarily in the intestine, it has a low potential for systemic metabolic drug–drug interactions with other drugs. Colesevelam has been shown to not interact with the lipid-lowering drugs lovastatin and fenofibrate; where interaction may be anticipated, separating dosing times by 4 h reduces the impact of any interaction. Available data confirms that colesevelam has additive cholesterol-lowering effects when used in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. Furthermore, in some patient populations, the additional glucose-lowering effect of colesevelam may be beneficial in offsetting hyperglycemic effects of other lipid-lowering drugs.",

    "abstract": "Acute heart failure (AHF) is characterized by high morbidity and mortality and high costs. Although the treatment of AHF has not changed substantially in recent decades, it is becoming clear that treatment strategies for AHF need to address both the immediate hemodynamic abnormalities giving rise to congestion as well as prevent organ damage that can influence long-term prognosis. Serelaxin, the recombinant form of human relaxin-2, a naturally occurring peptide hormone, has been found to significantly improve symptoms and signs of AHF, prevent in-hospital worsening heart failure, as well as significantly improve 180-day cardiovascular and all-cause mortality after a 48-h infusion commenced within 16 h of presentation (RELAX-AHF study). Available data suggest that the clinical benefits may be attributable to a potential combination of multiple actions of serelaxin, including improving systemic, cardiac, and renal hemodynamics, and protecting cells and organs from damage via anti-inflammatory, anti-cell death, anti-fibrotic, anti-hypertrophic, and pro-angiogenic effects. This manuscript describes the short- and long-term effects of serelaxin in AHF patients, analyzing how these effects can be explained by taking into account the range of hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic actions of serelaxin. In addition, this paper also addresses several aspects related to the role of serelaxin in the therapy of AHF that remain to be clarified and warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether supplementation with oral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) improves serum albumin and clinical outcomes in heart failure (HF) patients with hypoalbuminemia.We randomly assigned 18 in-hospital HF patients with serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL to receive oral BCAA granules (LIVACT®) for 28 days during their hospital stay or until discharge (BCAA group; N = 9) or to receive no supplementation (controls; N = 9), in addition to recommended HF therapy. The primary endpoints were changes from baseline in serum albumin and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR). Sixteen patients completed the study. The mean (± standard deviation) period of BCAA supplementation was 18.4 ± 8.4 days. Serum albumin significantly increased in the BCAA group [mean difference vs baseline, 0.44 g/dL; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.76; P = 0.014] and did not change in controls (0.18 g/dL; 95% CI - 0.05 to 0.40; P = 0.108). CTR significantly decreased in the BCAA group (- 2.3%; 95% CI - 3.8 to - 0.8; P = 0.014) and did not change in controls (- 1.0%; 95% CI - 2.3 to 0.3; P = 0.111).In-hospital HF patients with hypoalbuminemia supplemented with BCAAs showed increased serum albumin and decreased CTR.

    "abstract": "Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), especially those with recent (< 1 year) acute coronary syndrome (ACS), are at high risk for recurrent cardiovascular events. This risk can be reduced by lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. A comprehensive meta-analysis on the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of ezetimibe is lacking. This study attempts to address this gap. A systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials evaluating the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of ezetimibe in the ASCVD population was conducted. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for publications from database inception to August 2018 and for conference abstracts from 2015 to August 2018. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of ezetimibe in the ASCVD population and the recent ACS subgroup. In total, 12 studies were eligible for the meta-analyses. Treatment with combination ezetimibe plus statin therapy showed greater absolute LDL-C reduction than statin monotherapy (mean difference − 21.86 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval [CI] − 26.56 to − 17.17; p < 0.0001) after 6 months of treatment (or at a timepoint closest to 6 months). Similarly, in patients with recent ACS, combination ezetimibe plus statin therapy was favorable compared with statin monotherapy (mean treatment difference − 19.19 mg/dL; 95% CI − 25.22 to − 13.16; p < 0.0001). Ezetimibe, when added to statin therapy, provided a modest additional reduction in LDL-C compared with statin monotherapy. However, this may not be sufficient for some patients with ASCVD who have especially high LDL-C levels despite optimal statin therapy.",

On 11 December 2020, the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for the first COVID-19 vaccine, and vaccines are now widely available. Undoubtedly, the emergence of these vaccines has led to substantial relief, helping alleviate the fear and anxiety around the COVID-19 illness for both the general public and clinicians. However, recent cases of vaccine complications, including myopericarditis, have been reported after administration of COVID-19 vaccines. This article discusses the cases, possible pathogenesis of myopericarditis, and treatment of the condition. Most cases were mild and should not yet change vaccine policies, although prospective studies are needed to better assess the risk-benefit ratios in different groups.",

    "abstract": "Due to the high comorbidity of diabetes and hypertension, co-administration of metformin with anti-hypertensive drugs is likely. Baxdrostat is an aldosterone synthase inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of hypertension. In vitro data indicated that baxdrostat inhibits the multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1) and MATE2-K renal transporters. Metformin is a MATE substrate, so this study assessed potential effects of baxdrostat on the pharmacokinetics of metformin. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers received 1000 mg metformin alone and 1000 mg metformin in the presence of 10 mg baxdrostat in a randomized, crossover manner. Each treatment was separated by 10 or more days. Blood and urine samples were collected over a 3-day period after each treatment to measure plasma and urine concentrations of metformin. Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluations. There were no deaths, serious AEs, discontinuations due to treatment-emergent AEs, or noteworthy increases in AEs with either treatment, indicating that metformin and baxdrostat were well-tolerated when co-administered. Baxdrostat did not significantly affect plasma concentrations or renal clearance of metformin. The results of this study suggest that diabetic patients with hypertension receiving both metformin and baxdrostat are unlikely to require dose adjustment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier no. NCT05526690.",

Although early reperfusion is the most effective strategy to salvage ischemic myocardium, reperfusion injury can develop with the restoration of blood flow. Therefore, it is important to identify protection mechanisms and strategies for the heart after myocardial infarction. Recent studies have shown that multiple intracellular molecules and signaling pathways are involved in cardioprotection. Meanwhile, device-based cardioprotective modalities such as cardiac left ventricular unloading, hypothermia, coronary sinus intervention, supersaturated oxygen (SSO2), and remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) have become important areas of research. Herein, we review the molecular mechanisms of cardioprotection and cardioprotective modalities after ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) to identify potential approaches to reduce mortality and improve prognosis in patients with AMI.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin administered for primary prevention of CVD in patients with chronic kidney disease. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL and Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched from inception to 22 June 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating aspirin as primary prevention of CVD in chronic kidney disease were included. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models. Overall, 11 studies (6 RCTs and 5 cohort studies) with 24,352 patients were included. The meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that aspirin was associated with lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events [hazard ratio (HR): 0.79; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.64–0.97] and higher risk of major bleeding [risk ratio (RR): 1.35; 95% CI 1.15–1.58]. Incorporating observational evidence led to statistically non-significant findings in terms of risk of both cardiovascular events (pooled HR: 0.97; 95% CI 0.75–1.25; low certainty) and major bleeding (pooled RR: 1.21; 95% CI 0.99–1.48; moderate certainty). No statistically significant differences between aspirin and placebo were observed in the outcomes of mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke and renal events. RCT evidence points to a possible benefit in cardiovascular event reduction from aspirin administration, at the cost of increased major bleeding risk. This finding was not confirmed when the existing observational evidence was incorporated. Further research should determine the most appropriate subpopulation of chronic kidney disease patients that would benefit the most from prophylactic aspirin therapy. The study protocol has been prospectively registered and is publicly available from: https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.261ged63jv47/v1 .",

    "abstract": "Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are the mainstay of the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Due to their renal elimination, the risk of accumulation with the related bleeding risk may represent a limitation for the use of LMWHs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) as the risk of major bleeding is increased in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min, especially in patients with cancer. LMWH structure and molecular weight (MW) are heterogeneous among available agents. The elimination of tinzaparin, which has the highest mean MW among LMWHs, is less dependent on renal function as it is also metabolized through the reticuloendothelial system. A subcutaneous therapeutic dose of tinzaparin (175 IU/kg) once daily has been shown to cause no accumulation of anti-factor Xa activity in patients with CrCl ≥ 20 mL/min. Clinical experience from randomized controlled studies has shown no significant impact of CKD on bleeding risk in cancer patients receiving treatment doses of tinzaparin. This suggests that in these patients the use of treatment doses of tinzaparin does not require anticoagulation monitoring or dose adjustment.",

Investigators were able to adjust LLTs, including PCSK9i, according to their own clinical judgment. The primary effectiveness endpoint was LDL-C reduction from baseline to week 68.At baseline, approximately 50% of patients were statin intolerant, and approximately 90% reported a history of cardiovascular disease. LDL-C reductions remained generally unchanged from weeks 4 to 68 in each treatment group. At week 68, LDL-C mean percentage changes from baseline were - 41.7% (alirocumab 75 mg Q2W), - 53.7% (alirocumab 150 mg Q2W), and - 54.1% (evolocumab 140 mg Q2W). LDL-C reduction was 7.1% greater in patients receiving statins than in those not receiving statins because of statin intolerance (P < 0.0001). PCSK9i consistently improved levels of other lipoproteins throughout. Overall, 47.1% of patients reported adverse events at week 68.Consistent with clinical trial findings, alirocumab and evolocumab improved lipid levels in a real-world setting in patients with high baseline LDL-C levels despite receiving maximally tolerated LLTs. PCSK9i were generally well-tolerated.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recognized clinical benefit of statins on cardiovascular prevention, providing correct management of hypercholesterolaemia, possible adverse effects of their use cannot be disregarded. Previously published data shows that there is a risk of developing diabetes mellitus or experiencing changes in glucose metabolism in statin-treated patients. The possible determining factors are the drug characteristics (potency, dose), patient characteristics (kidney function, age, cardiovascular risk and polypharmacy because of multiple disorders) and the pre-diabetic state. In order to ascertain the opinion of the experts (primary care physicians and other specialists with experience in the management of this type of patient) we conducted a Delphi study to evaluate the consensus rate on diverse aspects related to the diabetogenicity of different statins, and the factors that influence their choice. Consensus was highly significant concerning aspects such as the varying diabetogenicity profiles of different statins, as some of them do not significantly worsen glucose metabolism. There was an almost unanimous consensus that pitavastatin is the safest statin in this regard. Factors to consider in the choice of a statin regarding its diabetogenicity are the dose and patient-related factors: age, cardiovascular risk, diabetes risk and baseline metabolic parameters (which must be monitored during the treatment), as well as kidney function.",

    "abstract": "Dapagliflozin [Farxiga® (USA); Forxiga® (EU)], a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, was recently approved in the USA and the EU for the treatment of adults with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The cardiovascular (CV) benefits of dapagliflozin were first observed in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, in which dapagliflozin 10 mg/day significantly reduced the risk of CV death or hospitalization for HF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic CV disease. In the subsequent DAPA-HF trial, dapagliflozin 10 mg/day in addition to standard of care was associated with a significantly lower risk of worsening HF or CV death than placebo in patients with HFrEF, regardless of the presence or absence of T2DM. The benefits of dapagliflozin also remained consistent regardless of background HF therapies. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated, with an overall safety profile consistent with its known safety profile in other indications. In conclusion, dapagliflozin is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment that represents a valuable new addition to the options available for symptomatic HFrEF. Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of death and disability. HFrEF occurs when the left ventricular ejection fraction is ≤ 40%. Conventional treatments for HFrEF include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, β-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate, and ivabradine. Dapagliflozin [Farxiga® (USA); Forxiga® (EU)] is an SGLT2 inhibitor originally developed for the treatment of T2DM. It was the first SGLT2 inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of adults with symptomatic HFrEF. When added to standard therapy, dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of worsening HF or CV death in patients with HFrEF, regardless of whether or not they had T2DM. Moreover, the beneficial effects of dapagliflozin were seen regardless of patients' usual HF medications. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated and is a valuable option for the treatment of symptomatic HFrEF.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who discontinue oral anticoagulants (OACs) are at higher risk of complications such as stroke.This analysis compared the risk of non-persistence with OACs among patients with NVAF.Adult patients with NVAF who initiated apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin were identified using 01JAN2013-30JUN2019 data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and four US commercial claims databases. Non-persistence was defined as discontinuation (no evidence of index OAC use for ≥ 60 days from the last days' supply) or switch to another OAC. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to illustrate time to non-persistence along with cumulative incidences of non-persistence. Baseline and time-varying covariates were evaluated, and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate non-persistence risk.In total, 363,823 patients receiving apixaban, 57,121 receiving dabigatran, 282,831 receiving rivaroxaban, and 317,337 receiving warfarin were included. Of these, 47-72% discontinued/switched OAC therapy within an average 9-month follow-up. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of non-persistence than were dabigatran (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.62), rivaroxaban (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.75-0.76), and warfarin (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.74-0.75). Dabigatran was associated with a higher risk of non-persistence than were warfarin (HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.19-1.22) and rivaroxaban (HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.22-1.25), and rivaroxaban was associated with a lower risk of non-persistence than was warfarin (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.98). Clinical events (stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding [MB]) during follow-up were predictors of non-persistence (stroke HR 1.57; 95% CI 1.53-1.61; MB HR 2.96; 95% CI 2.92-3.00).In over one million patients with NVAF, our results suggest differences in anticoagulation treatment persistence across OAC agents, even after accounting for clinical events after OAC initiation. It is important for clinicians and patients to take these differences into consideration, especially as non-persistence to OAC therapy is associated with thromboembolic complications.",

This study evaluated real-world clinical outcomes with rivaroxaban versus warfarin in patients with NVAF and obesity according to the number of concurrent medications.This retrospective cohort study identified patients with one or more pharmacy claim for rivaroxaban or warfarin from two large claims databases. Patients were required to have an atrial fibrillation diagnosis, body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2 and the presence of polypharmacy (1-4, 5-9, or ≥ 10 concurrent medications). Outcomes of stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding were compared between the rivaroxaban and warfarin cohorts after propensity score matching (PSM).A total of 95,875 patients were identified with one or more claim for either rivaroxaban or warfarin. After PSM, patient characteristics were balanced between cohorts (n = 21,547 in each cohort). The overall composite risk of stroke and systemic embolism was significantly lower in the rivaroxaban cohort compared with the warfarin cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.84; p < 0.001). The risks of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and systemic embolism separately were also significantly reduced with rivaroxaban. Major bleeding risk was similar between cohorts (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81-1.06; p = 0.2842), and results were consistent across the three polypharmacy groups.In this real-world study of NVAF patients with obesity, rivaroxaban was associated with lower risks of stroke and systemic embolism and similar risk of major bleeding versus warfarin across polypharmacy categories.",

    "abstract": "The effects of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) were recently reported. However, the hemodynamic impact of this well-established treatment in patients with HFrEF has been poorly systematically researched.We aimed to investigate the hemodynamic effects of sacubitril/valsartan among patients with HFrEF.Between 2016 and 2020, we retrospectively collected data for patients with HFrEF treated at the University Medical Center Mannheim, Germany. Data for 240 patients with HFrEF were available. We systematically analyzed echocardiographic parameters, all-cause hospitalization, and congestion rate.The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved from a median (minimum; maximum) of 28% (3; 65) before initiation of sacubitril/valsartan to a median of 34% (13; 64) at 24-month follow-up (p < 0.001). Systolic pulmonary atrial pressure (PAPsys) decreased from a median of 30 mmHg (13; 115) to 25 mmHg (20; 80) at 24-month follow-up (p = 0.005). The median (minimum; maximum) tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion improved from 17 mm (3; 31) at baseline to 20 mm (9; 30) at 12-month follow-up (p = 0.007). The incidence of severe and moderate mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valvular insufficiency improved after treatment. Hospitalization and congestion rates reduced at 24-month follow-up. The mortality rate in echocardiographic and functional nonresponders was higher than in responders (12.1 vs. 5.2%; p = 0.1 and 11.3 vs. 3.1%; p = 0.01, respectively).Follow-up 24 months after starting treatment with sacubitril/valsartan revealed sustained improvements in echocardiographic parameters, including LVEF, PAPsys, and cardiac valvular insufficiency. Rates of all-cause hospitalization and congestion had decreased significantly at follow-up. The mortality rate was higher in echocardiographic and functional nonresponders.",

    "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have become a first-line therapy for heart failure (HF) in adults. However, data on their use in HF associated with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) are limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SGLT2is in ACHD HF patients, supplementing guideline-directed medical therapy. A comprehensive systematic search and meta-analysis were conducted on studies examining SGLT2i use in ACHD HF patients. The primary endpoint was the change in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (FC), with secondary endpoints including changes in ventricular function and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. Additionally, the safety and tolerability of SGLT2is were evaluated. The meta-analysis included eight studies with 287 patients aged 19–67 years (median age 37.5 years). Adding SGLT2is to combined therapies significantly improved NYHA FC (log odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–2.23, p = 0.01) and reduced NT-proBNP levels (mean difference [MD] −0.43, 95% CI −0.70 to −0.16, p < 0.001). A notable decrease in systolic blood pressure was observed (MD −0.32, 95% CI −0.51 to −0.14, p = 0.00). The adverse effect profile was comparable to that seen in routine HF, with fewer HF hospitalizations post-SGLT2i initiation. Urinary tract infections occurred in 14 patients (5%), with no instances of hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis reported. Medication withdrawal due to adverse effects was noted in 19 patients (7%). SGLT2is are well tolerated in ACHD HF patients. Notably, SGLT2is improved NYHA FC and reduced NT-proBNP levels across a diverse ACHD HF patient cohort. However, further prospective, multicenter studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of SGLT2is in this unique patient population.",

    "abstract": "Persistent postoperative supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs) increase cardiac burden and aggravate cardiac hemodynamics. Therefore, for patients in unstable conditions after surgery, prompt and sustained control of heart rate is essential. The importance of β-adrenoceptor antagonists (β-blockers) in controlling such postoperative atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter has been established, and the usefulness of ultra-short-acting β1-blockers with high β1 selectivity has been suggested based on their safety and efficacy under such circumstances. Our objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of landiolol hydrochloride, an ultra-short-acting β1-selective blocker, in the treatment of postoperative SVT in patients with a high risk of myocardial ischemia, or in patients after highly invasive surgery, in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, group-comparative study. A total of 165 patients were randomly allocated to three groups and received LM or MH doses of landiolol hydrochloride or placebo. LM group: dose L (1-min loading dose at a rate of 0.03 mg/kg/min, followed by a 10-min infusion at 0.01 mg/kg/min) followed by dose M (1-min loading at a rate of 0.06 mg/kg/min, followed by a 10-min infusion at 0.02 mg/kg/min); MH group: dose M followed by dose H (1-min loading dose at a rate of 0.125 mg/kg/min, followed by a 10-min infusion at 0.04 mg/kg/min); placebo (PP) group: dose P (1-min loading dose at a rate of 0 mg/kg/min, followed by a 10-min infusion at 0 mg/kg/min) followed by another round of dose P. If the targeted heart-rate reduction was not obtained at the end of the first 10-min infusion, the higher dose was started. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who met the heart-rate reduction criteria (≥20 % reduction and <100 beats/min). The safety endpoint was the incidence of adverse events in each of the three groups. The percentages of patients who met the heart-rate reduction criteria (≥20 % reduction and <100 beats/min) were 0.0, 60.4, and 42.0 % in the PP, LM, and MH groups, respectively. There were significant differences in the LM and MH groups relative to the PP group, but there was no significant difference between the LM and MH groups. No significant difference was observed in the incidence of adverse events among the three groups: 29.6 % in the PP group, 45.5 % in the LM group, and 43.1 % in the MH group. Landiolol hydrochloride is effective and safe for patients with postoperative SVT.",

    "abstract": "Increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are recognized as a primary risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Lowering LDL-C levels clearly reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, with benefits related to both absolute reduction and duration of treatment; however, a threshold below which low LDL-C levels can be dangerous has never been established. Since the discovery of statins, cardiovascular research has focused on developing new lipid-lowering agents. Ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors have been found to further reduce LDL-C values and subsequent cardiovascular risk. Novel recently approved inclisiran and bempedoic acid, currently being tested in cardiovascular outcomes studies, are further expanding our pharmacological armamentarium, enabling the clinician to diminish residual risk related to LDL-C. Moreover, new agents are paving the way to successful treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. This review summarizes the main characteristics of current and emerging lipid-lowering therapies to assist with comprehensive evidence-based decision making.",

    "abstract": "Patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) experience infiltrative cardiomyopathy and heart failure symptoms requiring costly hospitalizations. The Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT) demonstrated the efficacy of tafamidis on the frequency of cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations in patients with ATTR-CM. As length of stay can affect the total hospitalization burden, our study aimed to better understand the impact of tafamidis on the number of CV-related hospital days avoided in the management of ATTR-CM patients. Data from ATTR-ACT were used to calculate the total burden of CV-related hospitalization (days) by treatment arm in this post hoc analysis. In the total trial population, patients receiving tafamidis had significantly fewer CV-related hospitalizations per year (relative risk reduction [RRR] 0.68; 0.4750 vs. 0.7025, p < 0.0001) and a shorter mean length of stay per CV-related hospitalization event (8.6250 vs. 9.5625 days) than patients receiving placebo. Taken together, tafamidis prevented 2.62 CV-related hospitalization days per patient per year. A subgroup analysis showed that with earlier treatment initiation of tafamidis, the annual number of CV-related hospitalizations was significantly lowered by 52% compared with placebo (RRR 0.48; 0.3378 vs. 0.7091, p < 0.0001). With 1.14 fewer days per hospitalization, tafamidis reduced the annual number of CV-related hospitalization days by 3.96 days per New York Heart Association class I/II patient. In patients with ATTR-CM, tafamidis was associated with a lower rate of CV-related hospitalizations and shorter length of hospital stay. Timely diagnosis and treatment with tafamidis could further decrease the total number of CV-related hospitalization days per year. NCT01994889.",

    "abstract": "Relatively little is known about the influence of extreme body weight on the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety of drugs used in many disease states. While direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have an advantage over warfarin in that they do not require routine drug monitoring, some may regard this convenience as less compelling in obese patients. Some consensus guidelines discourage using DOACs in patients weighing > 120 kg or with a body mass index > 35–40 kg/m2, given a sparsity of available data in this population and the concern that fixed dosing in obese patients might lead to decreased drug exposure and lower efficacy. Per the prescribing information, apixaban does not require dose adjustment in patients weighing above a certain threshold (e.g., ≥ 120 kg). Data from healthy volunteers and patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) have shown that increased body weight has a modest effect on apixaban's PK. However, the paucity of exposure data in individuals > 120 kg and the lack of guideline consensus on DOAC use in obese patients continue to raise concerns about potential decreased drug exposure at extreme weight. This article is the first to comprehensively review the available PK data in obese individuals without NVAF or VTE, and PK, PD, efficacy, effectiveness, and safety data for apixaban in obese patients with either NVAF or VTE, including subgroup analyses across randomized controlled trials and observational (real-world) studies. These data suggest that obesity does not substantially influence the efficacy, effectiveness, or safety of apixaban in these patients.

    "abstract": "The 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines recommend the use of four different classes of drugs for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): beta blockers (BB), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). Moreover, the 2023 ESC updated Guidelines suggest an intensive strategy of initiation and rapid up-titration of evidence-based treatment before discharge, based on trials not using the four-pillars. We hypothesized that an early concomitantly administration and up-titration of four-pillars, compared with a conventional stepwise approach, may impact the vulnerable phase after hospitalization owing to HF. This prospective, single center, observational study included consecutive in-hospital patients with HFrEF. After performing propensity score matching, they were divided according to treatment strategy into group 1 (G1), with predischarge start of all four-pillars, with their up-titration within 1 month, and group 2 (G2) with the pre Guidelines update stepwise four-pillars introduction. HF hospitalization, cardiovascular (CV) death, and the composite of both were evaluated between the two groups at 6-month follow-up. The study included a total of 278 patients who completed 6-month follow-up (139 for both groups). There were no differences in terms of baseline features between the two groups. At survival analysis, HF hospitalization risk was significantly lower in G1 compared with G2 (p < 0.001), while no significant differences were observed regarding CV death (p = 0.642) or the composite of CV death and HF hospitalization (p = 0.135). In our real-world population, patients with HF treated with a predischarge and simultaneous use of four-pillars showed a reduced risk of HF hospitalization during the vulnerable phase after discharge, compared with a conventional stepwise approach.",

    "abstract": "This post hoc subanalysis of the randomized Japanese Primary Prevention Project investigated whether once-daily low-dose aspirin versus no aspirin reduced the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in patients aged ≥ 70 years with atherosclerotic risk factors.Patients aged < 70 years (young-old) or ≥ 70 years (old) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes participated between 2005 and 2007. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin once daily or no aspirin plus standard of care. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes plus nonfatal stroke and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary outcome was a composite of the primary outcome plus transient ischemic attack, angina pectoris, and arteriosclerotic disease requiring medical or surgical intervention. Old (n = 7971) and young-old (n = 6493) patients were followed up for a median 5.02 years.Aspirin did not reduce the risk of primary (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.74-1.16]; P = 0.50) or secondary (0.85 [0.70-1.04]; P = 0.11) outcomes in patients aged ≥ 70 years. In old men with high-density lipoprotein < 40 mg/dL, treatment with low-dose aspirin was associated with a reduction in the incidence of the primary endpoint compared with the group not receiving aspirin (10/260 vs 22/250; HR 0.44 [95% CI 0.20-0.93]; P = 0.03). This subgroup was also found to contain significant larger proportions of patients with elevated body mass index, patients with diabetes mellitus, and smokers (P < 0.001). Old patients also showed differences in bleeding outcomes. Serious extracranial hemorrhage requiring transfusion or hospitalization occurred significantly more frequently in the aspirin-treated group than in the non-aspirin-treated group (35 [0.88%] vs 18 [0.45%]; HR 1.96 [1.11-3.46]; P = 0.020). Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred significantly more frequently in the aspirin-treated group than the non-aspirin-treated group (63 [1.58%] vs 18 [0.45%]; relative risk [RR] 3.5 [2.08-5.90]; P < 0.0001). Cerebral hemorrhage (intracranial hemorrhage) tended to occur more frequently in the aspirin-treated group than the non-aspirin-treated group (22 [0.55%] vs 11 [0.28%]; RR 2.01 [0.97-4.14]; P = 0.058). Cerebral hemorrhage occurred significantly more frequently in old patients than in young-old patients (33 [0.41%] vs 10 [0.15%]; HR 2.7 [1.34-5.53]; P = 0.0055). Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in a slightly higher proportion of old patients compared with young-old patients (81 [1.02%] vs 53 [0.82%]; RR 1.2 [0.88-1.76]; P = 0.21).Aspirin did not reduce the risk of the primary or secondary outcomes in old patients. Aspirin treatment may have reduced CVEs within a high CVE risk elderly population subgroup. Aspirin treatment in such a group requires caution, because of the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, severe extracranial hemorrhage requiring hospitalization or transfusion, and gastrointestinal bleeding in old patients receiving aspirin therapy.The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT00225849].",

    "abstract": "Effectiveness of oral anticoagulants (OACs) is critically dependent on patients' adherence to intake regimens. We studied the relative impact of attributes related to effectiveness, safety, convenience, and costs on the value of OAC therapy from the perspective of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.Four attributes were identified by literature review and expert interviews: effectiveness (risk of ischemic stroke), safety (risk of major bleeding, minor bleeding, gastrointestinal complaints), convenience (intake frequency, diet restrictions, international normalized ratio [INR] blood monitoring, pill type/intake instructions), and out-of-pocket costs. Focus groups were held in Spain, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom (N = 48) to elicit patients' preferences through the use of the analytical hierarchy process method.Effectiveness (60%) and side effects (27%) have a higher impact on the perceived value of OACs than drug convenience (7%) and out-of-pocket costs (6%). As for convenience, eliminating monthly INR monitoring was given the highest priority (40%), followed by reducing diet restrictions (27%), reducing intake frequency (17%) and improving the pill type/intake instructions (15%). The most important side effect was major bleeding (75%), followed by minor bleeding (15%) and gastrointestinal complaints (10%). Furthermore, 71% of patients preferred once-daily intake to twice-daily intake.Although the relative impact of convenience on therapy value is small, patients have different preferences for options within convenience criteria. Besides considerations on safety and effectiveness, physicians should also discuss attributes of convenience with patients, as it can be assumed that alignment to patient preferences in drug prescription and better patient education could result in higher adherence.",

    "abstract": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) treatment requires medically supervised intervention. Etripamil is a novel short-acting calcium channel blocker. Its intranasal spray formulation has a rapid onset of action and shows promise for the unsupervised treatment of PSVT. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etripamil nasal spray for the acute conversion of PSVT. A systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizing randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which were retrieved by systematically searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases through to 1 December 2022. RevMan version 5.4 software was used to pool dichotomous outcomes using risk ratio (RR) presented with the corresponding confidence interval (CI). Three RCTs with a total of 496 participants were included in our analysis. Etripamil was effective for PSVT conversion at 15 min (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.37–2.48), 30 min (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.42–2.44), and 60 min (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05–1.50) after drug administration; decreasing medical intervention-seeking (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37–0.90); and decreasing emergency room (ER) visits (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38–0.97). However, there was no difference at 300 min (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97–1.25) and it was associated with higher rates of adverse events (RR 3.17, 95% CI 2.15–4.69). Etripamil nasal spray was effective and well tolerated to induce PSVT termination for up to 60 min. Therefore, etripamil nasal spray constitutes a promising strategy for PSVT self-termination without medical supervision; however, further RCTs are required before endorsement in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Few data are available regarding the efficacy and safety of a single-pill combination (SPC) consisting of four medications in patients with concomitant hypertension and dyslipidemia. We aimed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose SPC consisting of 5 mg amlodipine, 100 mg losartan, 20 mg rosuvastatin, and 10 mg ezetimibe (A/L/R/E) in patients with concomitant hypertension and dyslipidemia. This was a 14-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial. In total, 145 patients were randomized to receive A/L/R/E, A/L, or L/R/E. The primary endpoints were the average change in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level in the A/L/R/E and A/L groups and the sitting systolic blood pressure (sitSBP) in the A/L/R/E and L/R/E groups. The numbers of patients with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were compared as safety variables. The average percentage change in the LDL-C level as the least squares mean (LSM) from the baseline LDL-C level at the end of the 8-week treatment was − 59.0% in the A/L/R/E group and 0.2% in the A/L group (LSM difference − 59.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] − 68.1 to − 50.4; p < 0.0001). The average change in the sitSBP as the LSM was − 15.8 mmHg in the A/L/R/E group and −4.7 mmHg in the L/R/E group (LSM difference − 11.1, 95% CI − 16.8 to − 5.4; p = 0.0002). No ADRs occurred in the A/L/R/E group. A/L/R/E as an SPC could be an effective treatment for patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia without significant safety issues.

    "abstract": "The cognitive safety of monoclonal antibody proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) has been established in clinical trials, but not yet in real-world observational studies. We assessed the cognitive function in patients initiating PCSK9i, and differences in cognitive function domains, to analyze subgroups by the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) achieved, and differences between alirocumab and evolocumab.This has a multicenter, quasi-experimental design carried out in 12 Spanish hospitals from May 2020 to February 2023. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).Among 158 patients followed for a median of 99 weeks, 52% were taking evolocumab and 48% alirocumab; the mean change from baseline in MoCA score at follow-up was + 0.28 [95% CI (- 0.17 to 0.73; p = 0.216)]. There were no significant differences in the secondary endpoints-the visuospatial/executive domain + 0.04 (p = 0.651), naming domain - 0.01 (p = 0.671), attention/memory domain + 0.01 (p = 0.945); language domain - 0.10 (p = 0.145), abstraction domain + 0.03 (p = 0.624), and orientation domain - 0.05 (p = 0.224)-but for delayed recall memory the mean change was statistically significant (improvement) + 0.44 (p = 0.001). Neither were there any differences in the three stratified subgroups according to lowest attained LDL-C level-0-54 mg/dL, 55-69 mg/dL and ≥ 70 mg/dL; p = 0.454-or between alirocumab and evolocumab arms.We did not find effect of monoclonal antibody PCSK9i on neurocognitive function over 24 months of treatment, either in global MoCA score or different cognitive domains. An improvement in delayed recall memory was shown. The study showed no differences in the cognitive function between the prespecified subgroups, even among patients who achieved very low levels of LDL-C. There were no differences between alirocumab and evolocumab.ClinicalTtrials.gov Identifier number NCT04319081.",

Blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asians have poor rates of hypertension awareness, treatment, and control. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome) in these populations, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockers are a good choice for foundation therapy. This review also discusses the importance of adherence and persistence with antihypertensive medication, which remain suboptimal in these non-white populations. Evidence suggests improvement with the use of single-pill combination therapy. Lastly, clinical trial data on the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of the combination of a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin receptor blocker, a widely utilized combination, in non-white populations are presented. PubMed was searched using the title/abstract key words (amlodipine AND valsartan AND [hypertension OR hypertensive] AND [black(s) OR African American(s) OR Hispanic(s) OR Latino(s) OR Mexican(s) OR Asian(s)]). In total, eight studies in patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension were identified (n = 1,111 black, n = 389 Hispanic/Latino, and n = 3,094 Asian). Results showed that treatment with the combination of amlodipine plus valsartan is a reasonable choice for initial therapy or in patients who fail to respond to monotherapy. These drug classes have complementary mechanisms of action and, when used concomitantly, the magnitude of blood pressure lowering in these non-white populations is generally comparable with that seen in non-Hispanic white patients.",

    "abstract": "This was an open-label, phase I, nonrandomized, single-sequence, crossover study to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of multiple doses of clarithromycin on the single-dose exposure, safety, and tolerability of apixaban in healthy subjects. In total, 19 subjects received a single oral dose of apixaban 10 mg on day 1. On day 4, subjects began receiving oral clarithromycin immediate release (IR) 500 mg twice daily (bid) for 4 days. On day 8, subjects received oral apixaban 10 mg and oral clarithromycin IR 500 mg bid. Oral clarithromycin IR 500 mg bid was given alone on days 9 and 10. Compared with apixaban alone, coadministration of apixaban with clarithromycin resulted in increased apixaban exposure. The adjusted geometric mean ratio (GMR) was 1.299 (90% confidence interval [CI] 1.220–1.384) for peak plasma concentration (Cmax), whereas the adjusted GMR for the area under the concentration curve (AUC(INF)) was 1.595 (90% CI 1.506–1.698). The mean half-life and median time to Cmax of apixaban were comparable with and without concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Administration of apixaban and clarithromycin concomitantly did not result in increased adverse events compared with administration of either agent alone. All adverse events were mild in intensity. Apixaban Cmax and AUC(INF) increased 30% and 60%, respectively, when multiple doses of clarithromycin were coadministered with apixaban versus administration of apixaban alone. The increase in apixaban Cmax and AUC(INF) with concomitant clarithromycin was less than that which has been observed when apixaban was given with ketoconazole. Administration of apixaban alone and in combination with clarithromycin bid was safe and generally well-tolerated by the healthy adult subjects in this study.

    "abstract": "We investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous recombinant human Neuregulin-1 (rhNRG-1), a DNA recombinant protein for the treatment of chronic heart failure, in healthy Chinese volunteers following single and multiple dose administration. To evaluate the safety and tolerance after single-dosing escalation, 28 subjects were divided into six groups (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.4 μg/kg) to receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of rhNRG-1 over 10 min by a randomized, open-label design. Only the 1.2 μg/kg dose group obtained pharmacokinetic parameters: Cmax was 7.645 (24.21) ng/mL, AUC0–t was 97.088 (21.41) min·ng/mL. To assess the safety and pharmacokinetics after multiple-dosing, 32 subjects were divided into four groups (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 μg/kg) to receive a 10-min IV infusion of rhNRG-1 for five consecutive days. After multiple dosing of 1.2 μg/kg, the Cmax value at day 5 was 8.838 (51.6) ng/mL and the AUC0–t value at day 5 was 109.890 (32.99) min·ng/mL. RhNRG-1 is rapidly cleared from the blood and has a short t1/2 of about 10 min. The adverse events related to rhNRG-1 mainly included flat or inverted T wave and gastrointestinal reactions, all of which were mild. It is concluded that rhNRG-1 is safe and well tolerated in healthy Chinese subjects at the dosing levels used in this study. The severity and frequency of adverse events did not increase with the prolongation of administration time.

    "abstract": "Our objective was to compare all-cause and stroke- and bleed-specific healthcare costs among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) treated with dabigatran or warfarin.Administrative claims data from the MarketScan® Databases for 2009-2014 were used. Patients with NVAF newly treated with dabigatran were matched 1:1 to those treated with warfarin. All-cause and stroke- and bleed-specific costs per patient per month (PPPM) ($US, year 2015 values) up to a 12-month follow-up period were analyzed. Stroke- or bleed-specific costs were defined as hospitalizations with stroke or bleed as the primary discharge diagnosis and outpatient claims with stroke or bleed diagnosis in any position. Differences in costs between dabigatran and warfarin users were assessed using descriptive and multivariate analyses.A total of 18,980 dabigatran-treated patients were matched to corresponding warfarin-treated patients. Adjusted all-cause total healthcare, inpatient, and outpatient costs were significantly lower for the dabigatran cohort ($US3053 vs. 3433; $US904 vs. 1194; $US1594 vs. 1894, respectively; all p < 0.001), but mean pharmacy costs were significantly higher ($US556 vs. 345, p < 0.001). Stroke-specific total healthcare and outpatient costs were significantly lower for the dabigatran than for the warfarin cohort ($US30.37 vs. 40.99 and $US7.36 vs. 12.20, respectively; p < 0.05 for both values). Similarly, bleed-specific total healthcare and inpatient costs were significantly lower for the dabigatran than for the warfarin cohort ($US50.00 vs. 73.49 and $US27.75 vs. 48.66, respectively; p < 0.01 for both values).Patients receiving dabigatran had significantly lower total all-cause, inpatient, and outpatient costs but higher pharmacy costs than those receiving warfarin. In addition, stroke-specific total and outpatient costs and bleed-specific total and inpatient costs were significantly lower in dabigatran users compared with warfarin users.",

    "abstract": "Unlike neighboring countries, the Netherlands does not have a national acute coronary syndrome (ACS) registry to evaluate quality of care. We conducted a pilot registry in two hospitals to assess the prescription of guideline-recommended therapies in Dutch patients with ACS. We included all consecutive patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) (n = 1309) admitted to two Dutch percutaneous coronary intervention centers between March 2015 and February 2016. We collected follow-up medication use and reasons for discontinuation at discharge and 1, 6, and 12 months post-discharge. We assessed the use of optimal medical therapy (OMT), defined as the combined prescription of aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, statins, β-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers. OMT prescription was 43.2% at discharge, 60.1% at 1 month, and 28.7% at 12 months. At 1 month, OMT prescription was significantly lower in patients with NSTEMI (51.8 vs. 65.7% for STEMI; p < 0.001). OMT prescription was lower in women (6 months: 55.4 vs. 62.0%, p = 0.036) and in elderly patients. In this pilot study that aimed to extend a national Dutch ACS registry to patients with STEMI and NSTEMI, OMT prescription was comparable to that in other local registries, was lower in women and patients with NSTEMI, and decreased with increasing age.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the USA. Several risk factors have been identified, and obesity has become one of prominent concern. Excessive weight is considered a risk factor for CVD based on evidence linking it to a hypercoagulable state. Considering the prevalence of CVD and obesity in the USA, along with the increased risk for thrombus-related events, anticoagulation plays a significant role in prevention and treatment. Direct oral anticoagulants have taken the place of many traditional anticoagulants. Considering the recently approved indications and continued postmarketing studies conducted with rivaroxaban, this updated review provides data on the overall impact of obesity on this compound. This includes data obtained from both healthy obese volunteers and obese patients with various CVD conditions enrolled in rivaroxaban clinical trials, along with data obtained from postmarketing real-world evidence studies. Assessment of the clinical pharmacology and population pharmacokinetics in obese individuals revealed no clinically relevant effects of increased weight. Additionally, subgroup analyses from each of the pivotal phase III trials supporting the current approved labeling also demonstrated consistent efficacy and safety results in obese patients. Lastly, these findings are further supported by several recent real-world evidence studies assessing the continued effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban. In conclusion, rivaroxaban's overall pharmacological and clinical profile remained consistent in obese adults when assessed in both drug development and postmarketing studies, supporting the premise that higher weight does not necessitate adjustment in either dose strength or regimen.",

    "abstract": "Patients with adult congenital heart disease (CHD) have various indications for anticoagulation (e.g., presence of Fontan circuit, atrial fibrillation due to surgical scar). Guidelines recommend vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for thromboprophylaxis in adult CHD, as trial data comparing safety/efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) to VKA are not available in this population. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for trials comparing DOAC with VKA in patients with ACHD. Outcomes of interest were efficacy endpoints (thromboembolic complications) and safety endpoints (bleeding complications). Results were meta-analyzed and sensitivity analyses were performed. A total of 4 retrospective studies comprising 6004 patients (2566 DOAC, 3438 VKA) were analyzed. Compared with VKA, DOAC did not cause a statistically significant difference in incidence of thromboembolism (risk ratio, RR, 0.76; 95% confidence intervals, CI, 0.28, 2.07); composite bleeding (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71, 1.47); major bleeding (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92, 1.21); minor bleeding (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.51, 2.44); or intracranial bleeding (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.50, 1.46). Numerically, the DOAC arm had fewer thromboembolisms/intracranial bleeds but more major/composite bleeds. However, upon removal of the largest study, the DOAC arm had fewer major/composite bleeds. DOAC did not confer a significant increase in either thromboembolic or bleeding risk as compared with VKA. Sensitivity analysis showed notable heterogeneity among studies. Large-scale trials comparing DOAC with VKA in patients with adult CHD are needed.",

    "abstract": "Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays a pivotal role in B-cell receptor signaling, making it a key therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies. Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKIs) have revolutionized the treatment landscape, improving survival outcomes in conditions such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. However, despite their clinical efficacy, BTKIs—particularly first-generation agents such as ibrutinib—are associated with significant cardiovascular toxicity, including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, bleeding, and, in rare cases, ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure. This narrative review explores the evolving landscape of BTKI-related cardiovascular toxicity, from first-generation drugs to next-generation agents that have improved safety profiles. We summarize current evidence on the incidence, mechanisms, and risk factors of BTKI-induced cardiovascular events and highlight potential predictive tools and mitigation strategies. Given the increasing use of these agents, a comprehensive understanding of their cardiovascular impact is essential for optimizing treatment selection and patient outcomes. Future research should focus on refining risk stratification models and developing cardioprotective strategies to ensure the long-term safety of BTKI therapy.",

    "abstract": "Stable angina management and pharmacotherapy varies widely despite the longstanding availability of several drug classes. We herein review current angina management strategies through the lens of optimal medical therapy (OMT), while highlighting emerging therapies and the growing clinical significance of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD). This narrative review synthesizes findings from existing research and key clinical trials to outline both established and evolving treatment approaches for chronic stable angina. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers remain the foundation of symptom management, while nitrates, ranolazine, ivabradine, and trimetazidine may be considered for refractory symptoms. Few novel pharmacologic therapies have emerged in recent decades, underscoring a critical need for innovation—particularly in the treatment of CMD, which is increasingly recognized as a distinct pathophysiologic entity requiring targeted therapy. Advances in invasive coronary function testing have improved diagnostic accuracy for CMD, yet consensus on optimal treatment remains elusive. Emerging interventional strategies and stem cell-based interventions show promise for patients with refractory angina who lack further revascularization options. The limited progress in novel pharmacologic development reinforces the need for ongoing research to refine therapeutic strategies for CMD and expand treatment options for patients with treatment-resistant angina.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) represents a complex clinical syndrome requiring the timely initiation of disease-modifying therapies. However, the optimal timing for introducing these therapies in the hospital setting remains an area of investigation. This study aims to evaluate whether the early in-hospital initiation of sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) facilitates the introduction of angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) during hospitalization and whether this strategy is associated with improved left ventricular systolic function at 6-month follow-up. In this prospective, observational, single-centre study, consecutive patients with HFrEF were enrolled and divided into two groups on the basis of the timing of SGLT2i initiation: Group 1 (in-hospital) and Group 2 (post-discharge). The differences in terms of ARNI introduction within hospitalization were evaluated in the two groups. Changes in echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], left ventricular end-diastolic volume [LVEDV], left ventricular end-systolic volume [LVESV], E/e′ ratio) at 6-month follow up have been compared among patients treated with ARNI+SGLT2i and SGLT2i alone. A total of 285 patients were enrolled, 151 for G1 and 134 for G2. Early in-hospital use of SGLT2i was an independent predictor of ARNI initiation before discharge (odds ratio, OR: 3.31; 95% confidence intervals, CI 1.87–5.84; p < 0.001). Among the 89 patients of G1 who completed 6 months of follow-up, early in-hospital therapy with SGLT2i and ARNI represents an independent significant predictor of LVEF > 10% improvement, compared with those treated with SGLT2i alone (OR: 5.353; 95% CI 1.504–12.070; p < 0.003). Early in-hospital initiation of SGLT2i in patients with HFrEF is associated with a higher likelihood of in-hospital ARNI introduction and with significant improvements in left ventricular systolic function at 6-month follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Primary care physicians play a significant role in managing heart failure (HF), with the goals of reducing mortality, avoiding hospitalization, and improving patients' quality of life. Most HF-related hospitalizations and deaths occur in patients with New York Heart Association functional class II or III, many of whom are perceived to have stable disease, which often progresses without clinical symptoms due to underlying deleterious effects of neurohormonal imbalance and endothelial dysfunction. Management includes lifestyle changes and stepped pharmacological therapy directed at the four stages of HF, with aggressive uptitration of therapies, including beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Recently, two new HF treatments have become available in clinical practice. Ivabradine was approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF in patients with stable, symptomatic HF. Additionally, the angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril/valsartan, was found to be significantly superior to enalapril in reducing risks of cardiovascular death and HF-related hospitalization. The respective 2016 and 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America clinical practice guideline updates recommend that patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy be switched to ARNI therapy to further reduce morbidity and mortality. For HF management to be maximally effective, physicians must be knowledgeable about the risks and benefits of treatments and stay engaged with patients to identify signs of disease progression. This article provides an overview of the progressive nature of HF in apparently stable patients and describes areas for treatment improvement that may help to optimize patient care.",

    "abstract": "In patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases is elevated. Moreover, various features, also including pro-thrombotic status, further predispose these patients to increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events. Thus, the identification of optimal antithrombotic strategies in terms of the risk–benefit ratio and outcome improvement in this setting is crucial. However, debated issues on antithrombotic therapies in patients with COVID-19 are multiple and relevant. In this article, we provide ten questions and answers on risk stratification and antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatments in patients at risk of/with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection based on the scientific evidence gathered during the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant problem for the aging population and remains a major factor underlying stroke risk. Warfarin anticoagulation has been proven effective for stroke prevention in AF, but can be difficult to manage and requires frequent monitoring. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been shown to be as effective as warfarin for stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF (NVAF) and are associated with a reduced risk of bleeding compared with warfarin. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban have been approved in the USA for reducing the risk of stroke in patients with NVAF. In this article, AF risk assessment is discussed and NOAC phase III clinical trials for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events are reviewed. Further, differences in stroke and bleeding outcomes between NOACs are highlighted, the use of NOACs for cardioversion and special patient populations is discussed, and management considerations for patients with AF are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Despite the availability of lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) that are safe and effective, the overall rate of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) control at a population level in real-life studies is low. Higher-intensity treatment, earlier intervention, and longer-term treatment have all been shown to improve outcomes. However, in clinical practice, actual exposure to LLT is a product of the duration and intensity of, and adherence to, the treatment. To increase exposure to LLTs, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommended a stepwise optimization of LLTs by increasing statin intensity to the maximally tolerated dose, with subsequent addition of ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. Evidence from randomized controlled trials performed in a range of patients suggested that adding ezetimibe to statins rather than doubling the statin dose resulted in significantly more patients at LDL-C goal and significantly fewer patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events. In addition, data showed that combination treatments effectively increased exposure to LLT. Despite these data and recommendations, optimization of LLT is often limited to increasing statin dose. Therapeutic inertia and poor treatment adherence are significant and prevalent barriers to increasing treatment exposure. They are known to be influenced by pill burden and complexity of treatment. Single-pill combinations provide a strategic approach that supports the intensification of treatment without increasing pill burden or treatment complexity. Single-pill combinations, compared with free associations, have been shown to increase the adherence to LLT and the percentage of patients at LDL-C goal.",

    "abstract": "Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who require additional low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering despite maximally tolerated statins have a significant unmet medical need and are at increased risk of future cardiovascular events and a reduced quality of life. We aimed to estimate the percentage of cardiovascular events avoided following treatment with a fixed-dose combination of bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe (BA+EZE FDC) versus ezetimibe (EZE) in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease receiving maximally tolerated statins across a range of baseline LDL-C levels. A Markov cohort simulation model estimated major adverse cardiovascular events avoided over a lifetime horizon among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and baseline LDL-C levels from 80 to >200 mg/dL. BA+EZE FDC was compared with EZE based on mean percent LDL-C reductions versus placebo reported in a phase III trial. Health outcomes for the average patient were extrapolated to a US population of 100,000 persons using evidence on contemporary LDL-C levels from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease not at the LDL-C goal with maximally tolerated statins, the addition of BA+EZE FDC compared with the addition of EZE was predicted to provide incremental absolute reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events dependent on baseline LDL-C levels at the population level. For those with baseline LDL-C of 101–110 mg/dL (n = 15,237), there were 4.9% (744) fewer events predicted, while for patients with baseline LDL-C of > 200 mg/dL (n = 1689), 10.9% (184) fewer events were predicted through the addition of BA+EZE FDC versus EZE. Further LDL-C reductions through the addition of BA+EZE FDC to maximally tolerated statins are predicted to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events compared with the addition of EZE. Benefits are potentially greater among those with higher starting LDL-C.",

Between May 2019 and December 2020, 430 patients with 6 months' database activity were indexed from the de-identified US Optum electronic healthcare records at first diagnosis of ATTRwt-CM or prescription of tafamidis, then followed until last activity or death.

Median time from index to tafamidis prescription, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 5.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-not evaluable).Factors associated with tafamidis prescription in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression (hazard ratio [95% CI]) included age ≥ 65 years (2.1 [1.07-4.05]), male sex (1.6 [1.07-2.28]), having heart failure/cardiomyopathy (2.4 [1.54-3.82]), and having had technetium-99m pyrophosphate myocardial scintigraphy (1.7 [1.28-2.28]).The clinical characteristics of patients with ATTRwt-CM who were prescribed tafamidis in the real world were broadly comparable with those who took part in ATTR-ACT. Further studies are needed to evaluate hereditary and ATTRwt-CM patient populations in the real world and assess the long-term outcomes associated with disease management pathways.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01994889.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive, cureless disease, characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance and remodeling, with subsequent ventricular dilatation and failure. New therapeutic targets are being investigated for their potential roles in improving PAH patients' symptoms and reversing pulmonary vascular pathology. We aimed to address the available knowledge from the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the role of Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitors, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) inhibitors, estrogen inhibitors, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators on the PAH evaluation parameters. This systematic review (SR) was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (CDR42022340658) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Overall, 5092 records were screened from different database and registries; 8 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria were included. The marked difference in the study designs and the variability of the selected outcome measurement tools among the studies made performing a meta-analysis impossible. However, the main findings of this SR relate to the powerful potential of the AMPK activator and the imminent antidiabetic drug metformin, and the BMP2 inhibitor sotatercept as promising PAH-modifying therapies. There is a need for long-term studies to evaluate the effect of the ROCK inhibitor fasudil and the estrogen aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in PAH patients. The role of tacrolimus in PAH is questionable. The discrepancy in the hemodynamic and clinical parameters necessitates defining cut values to predict improvement. The differences in the PAH etiologies render the judgment of the therapeutic potential of the tested drugs challenging. Metformin and sotatercept appear as promising therapeutic drugs for PAH. This work was registered in PROSPERO (CDR42022340658).",

    "abstract": "Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with aspirin 100 mg daily was shown to be better than aspirin 100 mg daily for preventing cardiovascular (CV) death, stroke or myocardial infarction in patients with either stable coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease (PAD). The cost-effectiveness of this regimen in this population is essential for decision-makers to know. US direct healthcare system costs (in USD) were applied to hospitalized events, procedures and study drugs utilized by all patients. We determined the mean cost per participant for the full duration of the trial (mean follow-up of 23 months) plus quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over a lifetime using a two-state Markov model with 1-year cycle length. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the price of rivaroxaban and the annual discontinuation rate. The costs of events and procedures were reduced for Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies (COMPASS) patients who received rivaroxaban 2.5 mg orally (BID) plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared with ASA alone. Total costs were higher for the combination group ($7426 versus $4173) after considering acquisition costs of the study drug. Over a lifetime, patients receiving rivaroxaban plus ASA incurred $27,255 more and gained 1.17 QALYs compared with those receiving ASA alone resulting in an ICER of $23,295/QALY. ICERs for PAD only and polyvascular disease subgroups were lower. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID plus ASA compared with ASA alone was cost-effective (high value) in the USA.

    "abstract": "β-blockers are a fundamental component of cardiovascular disease (CVD) management, while β2-agonists are used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Current guidelines recommend that these conditions be treated as usual, even when they coexist. However, there have been concerns over COPD exacerbation risk with β-blockers and attenuation of the beneficial effects of β2-agonists in this comorbid population, leading to β-blocker underuse. Recent evidence suggests that β-blockers, particularly cardioselective β-blockers, do not increase COPD exacerbations, demonstrate good efficacy and safety, and improve survival in patients with COPD after first-time myocardial infarction. In atrial fibrillation with COPD, both cardioselective and nonselective β-blockers may be associated with a lower COPD exacerbation risk than calcium channel blockers, as well as improving outcomes and reducing mortality risk. In this review, we summarize the β-blocker prescribing patterns in patients with CVD and COPD; describe the reasons for β-blocker underuse in patients with CVD with COPD; collate up-to-date evidence on the effects of β-blockers on symptoms and outcomes in each of these comorbid populations; and review the current treatment guidelines for coexisting COPD and CVD to support the rational prescribing of β-blockers. Finally, we provide recommendations for future research needed to demonstrate the clinical rationale of prescribing β-blockers and to encourage the generation of more robust evidence-based guidelines for β-blockers use. Future large-scale, prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to expand the body of evidence and better understand the effects of β-blockers in CVD with comorbid COPD.",

    "abstract": "Obicetrapib, a selective cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor in development for the treatment of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk, is expected to be administered with high-intensity statins in clinical practice. This study was performed to assess the effect of obicetrapib on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. An open-label study was conducted to evaluate the PK of atorvastatin 80 mg (cohort 1, n = 42) or rosuvastatin 40 mg (cohort 2, n = 32, non-Asians) with and without co-administration of 10 mg obicetrapib in healthy adult males and females. Study participants received statin on day - 4, obicetrapib on days 1-11, statin co-administered with obicetrapib on day 12, and obicetrapib on days 13-17. Blood samples were collected throughout the dosing period and analyzed for plasma obicetrapib (both cohorts); atorvastatin, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin, and para-hydroxy atorvastatin (cohort 1), and rosuvastatin (cohort 2). Safety and tolerability were also assessed. The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios for the log-transformed maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve from time 0 to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUCt) and from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were all within the range pre-specified for bioequivalence (80.00-125.00%) of statin plus obicetrapib versus statin alone. Although there were significant treatment effects for atorvastatin AUCt (p = 0.0026) and AUCinf (p = 0.0012), the differences were small (9-10%) and not deemed clinically important. Overall, all study drugs were safe and well tolerated. No clinically significant PK interaction occurred between multiple daily doses of obicetrapib on the single-dose PK of either atorvastatin or rosuvastatin in healthy volunteers. NCT06081166.",

    "abstract": "Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure (HF), with a higher prevalence in older patients with comorbidities requiring concomitant medical therapy. Acoramidis is a next-generation transthyretin stabilizer with near-complete protein stabilization (≥ 90%) administered orally twice daily (BID) for treatment of ATTR-CM. We report on oral medication use in patients with ATTR-CM using two complementary sources: the ATTRibute-CM trial and real-world claims data. In the ATTRibute-CM study, participants with ATTR-CM were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 800 mg of acoramidis hydrochloride or matching placebo BID for 30 months. Participants from acoramidis and placebo groups were pooled for this analysis. Baseline oral medication use was collected upon enrollment in the study. Real-world data were obtained from patients with ATTR-CM in Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (Optum CDM) who met the stability criteria. Patients meeting the stability criteria had: (1) ≥ 2 years of continuous enrollment with ≥ 3-months look-back and a 12-month look-forward from index diagnosis, during the study period of 2018–2021 and (2) ≥ 28 days of continuous treatment for a given dosing frequency within the 12-month look-forward period. The ATTRibute-CM study randomly assigned 632 participants with ATTR-CM (mean [± SD] age: 77.3 [6.6] years). At entry to the study, 407 (64.4%) participants were using a medication that was administered BID, three times daily (TID), or four times daily (QID), and 392 (62.0%) participants were using at least one medication administered BID. The most frequent BID medications were apixaban, furosemide, metformin, metoprolol, and carvedilol. In ATTRibute-CM, accountability to acoramidis was high (97.1%). From a pool of 2.46 million patients with HF and cardiomyopathy identified in the Optum CDM, 12,116 patients (mean [± SD] age: 76.3 [9.4] years) met the criteria for ATTR-CM, and 5601 patients met the stability criteria. Analysis from this real-world database demonstrated that 4351 (92.1%) patients were prescribed a medication that was administered BID, TID, or QID and 4166 (88.2%) patients were prescribed at least one BID medication. The most frequent medications regardless of dosing frequency included furosemide, atorvastatin, metoprolol, apixaban, and carvedilol. The most frequent BID medications were apixaban, carvedilol, furosemide, metoprolol, and potassium chloride. Patients with ATTR-CM take oral medications administered multiple times a day for the treatment of HF and other comorbidities. As a BID medication, acoramidis does not appear to deviate from non-ATTR-CM pharmacotherapy strategies, and is therefore not expected to impose additional burden in a real-world setting. These data suggest that acoramidis may align with and could possibly be incorporated into patients' existing non-ATTR-CM pharmacotherapeutic regimens. NCT03860935.",

    "abstract": "The clinical syndrome of heart failure (HF) can be described as the reduced capacity of the heart to deliver blood throughout the body. To compensate for inadequate tissue perfusion, the renin–angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) become activated, resulting in increased blood pressure, heart rate, and blood volume. Consequent activation of the natriuretic peptide system (NPS) typically balances these effects; however, the NPS is unable to sustain compensation for excessive neurohormonal activation over time. Until recently, mortality benefits have been provided to patients with HF only by therapies that target the RAAS and SNS, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and beta-blockers. Sacubitril/valsartan, the first-in-class angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), targets both the NPS and RAAS to further improve clinical outcomes. This review discusses the focused management of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and suggests changes to current management paradigms. From this assessment, the evidence supports favoring sacubitril/valsartan over ACEIs or ARBs, and this therapy should be used in conjunction with beta-blockers to further decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF.",

    "abstract": "American and European associations of cardiology published specific guidelines about recommended drugs for secondary prevention in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Our aim was to assess whether drug prescription for STEMI patients was in accordance with the guidelines at discharge and after 1 year. We used data of 361 patients admitted for STEMI in a tertiary hospital in Switzerland from 2014 to 2016. We assessed the adequacy of prescription of recommended drugs at two time points: discharge and after 1 year. Medications assessed were aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and β-blockers. We took into account several criteria like statin dosage (low versus high intensity) and presence of contraindication for consideration of optimal therapy. Predictors of incomplete prescription of guideline medications were then assessed with multivariate logistic regression models. From discharge (n = 358) to 1-year follow-up (n = 303), rate of optimal prescription was reduced from 98.6 to 91.7% for aspirin, from 93.9 to 79.1% for P2Y12 inhibitors, from 83.8 to 65.7% for statins, from 98.6 to 95.6% for ACEIs/ARBs, and from 97.1 to 96.9% for β-blockers. Predictors of incomplete prescription of guideline medications at discharge were female sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.54, p = 0.007), active or former smoker status (OR 2.29, p = 0.017), multivessel disease (OR 2.07, p = 0.022), left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% (OR 2.49, p = 0.008), and transfer to cardiac surgery (OR 9.66, p = 0.018). At 1 year, age > 65 (OR 1.92, p = 0.036) remained the only significant predictor. The present study showed a high prescription rate of guideline-recommended medications in a referral center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. At discharge, women and co-morbid patients were at the highest risk of incomplete prescription of guideline medications, whereas long-term prescription was suboptimal for elderly. A drug lacking at time of discharge was rarely introduced within the year, which underscores the paramount importance of optimal prescription at time of discharge. Strategies like implementing a standardized prescription could reduce the proportion of suboptimal prescription. It could therefore be one way to improve the long-term quality of care of our patients to the highest level. This study used local data from AMIS Plus—National Registry of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Switzerland (NCT01305785).",

The patients were randomized to receive either OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5 or OM/HCTZ 20/12.5 once daily for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, patients with uncontrolled BP were assigned to receive either OM/AML/HCTZ 40/5/12.5 or OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5 in an additional 8-week open-label extension period.A total of 623 patients received a 4-week run-in treatment with OM/HCTZ, 341 patients were randomized, and finally, 167 patients in the OM/AML/HCTZ group and 171 patients in the OM/HCTZ group were analyzed for the full analysis set. Non-responders after the 8 weeks of double-blind treatment continued the 8-week open-label treatment with OM/AML/HCTZ 40/5/12.5 mg (n = 32) or OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5 mg (n = 71). After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, the changes in msDBP were -9.50 (8.46) mmHg in the OM/AML/HCTZ group and -4.23 (7.41) mmHg in the OM/HCTZ group (both p < 0.0001 vs. baseline; p < 0.0001 between groups). The response rates for both msSBP and msDBP at week 8 were 65.27 % in the OM/AML/HCTZ group and 37.43 % in the OM/HCTZ group (p < 0.0001 between groups). The response rates for both msSBP and msDBP at week 16 after open-label treatment were 18.75 % in the OM/AML/HCTZ 40/5/12.5 group and 46.48 % in the OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5 group (p = 0.0073 between groups). All medications were well tolerated.In Korean patients with moderate hypertension not controlled with dual FDC therapy (OM/HCTZ 20/12.5) as first-line therapy, switching to triple FDC therapy (OM/AML/HCTZ 20/5/12.5) was associated with significant BP reductions and greater achievement of BP goals, and was well tolerated (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01838850).",

    "abstract": "Elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Many guidelines recommend LDL-C as a primary treatment target, and statins represent the cornerstone of treatment for lipid management. Recently revised guidelines recommend even more intense management of LDL-C, especially in patients at moderate and high risk. However, LDL-C levels in the Chinese population differ from those in Western populations, and the benefits and safety of the maximum allowable dose of statins have yet to be determined. Furthermore, in practice, many patients do not achieve the increasingly stringent LDL-C goals. Consequently, alternative approaches to lipid management are required. Combination therapy with ezetimibe and a statin, which have complementary mechanisms of action, is more effective than statin monotherapies, even at high doses. Several clinical studies have consistently shown that combination therapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin lowers LDL-C more potently than statin monotherapies. Moreover, the safety and tolerability profile of the combination therapy appears to be similar to that of low-dose statin monotherapies. This review discusses the role of simvastatin in combination with ezetimibe in controlling dyslipidemia in Chinese patients, particularly the efficacy and safety of combination therapy in light of recently published clinical data.",

    "abstract": "In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), current guidelines recommend against combining potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors (i.e. ticagrelor or prasugrel) with oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, but the evidence is limited. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors with clopidogrel in patients receiving OAC therapy for AF after a recent PCI. Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) reporting outcomes according to the P2Y12 inhibitor used. Major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding were the safety endpoints, while the efficacy outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor were compared with clopidogrel. A subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the differences between patients treated with dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT) versus triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT). Four RCTs that included 10,057 patients were included in this analysis. Potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors were associated with a significant increase in major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with clopidogrel (risk ratio [RR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–1.59, p = 0.01; number needed to harm 18, 95% CI 12–36). This finding was consistent regardless of the concomitant antithrombotic therapy (DAT vs. TAT; p = 0.69). The risk of MACE did not differ between potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors and clopidogrel (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57–1.82). In patients receiving OAC therapy for AF after a recent PCI, potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors increase the risk of clinically relevant bleeding compared with clopidogrel, with no evident benefit in terms of MACE reduction.",

Model-based analyses from ATTR-ACT can examine predictor effects on dose-response/exposure-response relationships.Parametric hazard distributions were developed for all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization. Time-to-event models were fitted to survival data, and repeated time-to-event models were fitted to hospitalization data. Disease-specific characteristics were assessed as baseline predictors of event hazards.There were 441 patients in this analysis. At month 30, 70.5% (tafamidis) and 57.1% (placebo) of patients were alive, with 154/441 deaths reported; 495 cardiovascular-related hospitalizations occurred. The cumulative risk of death was 42.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 24.2-58.0) lower with tafamidis than with placebo, regardless of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class; significant predictors of decreased risk were genotype (wild-type), greater 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) distance, higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations. The average cumulative risk of cardiovascular-related hospitalization up to 30 months was 40.8% (95% CI 31.0-49.7) lower with tafamidis in NYHA class I/II patients. Significant predictors of reduced risk were greater 6MWT distance, higher LVEF, and lower BUN and troponin I concentrations.Tafamidis reduced cumulative mortality and hospitalization risk versus placebo in patients with ATTR-CM.

    "abstract": "oral anticoagulant (DOAC) agents are becoming the anticoagulation strategy of choice for most clinical risks for which they are indicated. However, residual uncertainty remains regarding their use in preventing stroke in patients with low bodyweight [< 60 kg or body mass index (BMI) < 18 kg/m2]. We have carried out pooled systematic analyses of published studies to determine the efficacy and safety of these agents compared with warfarin in stroke prevention in patients with low bodyweight. We carried out a comprehensive search of electronic databases from inception to June 2023 for eligible studies reporting on the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation who had low bodyweight. These include PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Science Citation Index, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness. Using the random effects model, derived pooled odd ratios (with their corresponding confidence intervals) of mortality outcomes in patient cohorts exposed to direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation who had low bodyweight. Nine studies (n = 159,514 patients) were included in our meta-analysis. DOAC analogs were associated with lower stroke recurrence compared with warfarin [odds ratio (OR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–0.9]; however, there was no significant difference in the composite outcome (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59–1.09) and mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.48–1.41). Additionally, DOAC analogs showed a significant reduction in major bleeding events by 30% compared with warfarin (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62–0.80). In this pooled meta-analytical synthesis of studies comprising both real-world and randomized controlled data, the use of DOAC analogs in patients with atrial fibrillation and low bodyweight (< 60 kg or BMI < 18 kg/m2) was associated with a significant reduction in risks of stroke and major bleeding compared with patient cohorts stabilized on warfarin-based therapy. There was uncertainty regarding the composite outcome and mortality point estimate between these two anticoagulation strategies. This finding helps to resolve the uncertainty associated with the use of DOACs in this cohort. Additionally, it suggests the need for confirmatory non-inferiority randomized controlled trials evaluating DOACs versus warfarin in this cohort of patients.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the leading cause of death in Colombia. While the rate of hypertension awareness in Colombia is generally high, rates of treatment initiation, adherence, and blood pressure (BP) control are suboptimal. Major international hypertension guidelines recommend starting treatment with a combination of antihypertensive agents, and the use of a single-pill combination (SPC) to maximize adherence. In contrast, Colombian hypertension guidelines recommend starting treatment with diuretic monotherapy in most patients, and only initiating combination therapy in those with BP > 160/100 mmHg. Therefore, the aim of the current narrative review is to examine the rationale for using SPCs to treat hypertension in Colombia, in the context of the major issues for BP control there. There is evidence of widespread therapeutic inertia in hypertension management, particularly in primary care, in Colombia. Moreover, combination therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and long-acting calcium channel blockers, which are internationally recommended as first-line drug therapies, are underutilized there. Adherence to antihypertensive therapy is low in Colombia and may be enhanced by use of SPCs as well as better patient education and follow-up. While there are promising national initiatives to improve BP management, more needs to be done by individual physicians. Antihypertensive SPCs are available on the national essential medicines list and may help to overcome some of the problems with suboptimal adherence, therapeutic inertia, and low rates of BP control that contribute to the high cardiovascular death rate in Colombia.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials, essential for medical advancement, vary significantly in methodology and regulatory pathways depending on the type of therapeutic intervention (i.e., drugs or devices). This study aimed to determine whether the drug or device intervention types influence the impact of randomized trials in cardiovascular medicine. We analyzed late-breaking randomized controlled trials presented at major cardiology conferences from 2015 to 2021. The primary endpoint was the total number of citations obtained. Secondary endpoints included the number of citations at 1 and 2 years, number of total and 1-year mentions, and several metrics of study conduct and publication. Statistical analysis included tests for comparisons of continuous or categorical variables, based on their distribution, as appropriate. To adjust the results for potential confounders, univariable and multivariable regression models were utilized. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore both the effect of neutral or positive study outcomes on the comparative impact of drug versus device trials and the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the primary endpoint. Of 382 eligible randomized trials, 227 (59.4%) were trials of drugs and 155 (40.6%) were trials of devices. Drug trials had a higher median number of total citations compared to device studies (93 [interquartile range {IQR} 48–137] vs. 82 [IQR 39–192]; p = 0.025). This difference was consistent at 1 and 2 years and was also observed in the number of total mentions and mentions at 1 year. All the metrics of study conduct and publication were similar, except for drug studies being more often stopped prematurely (8.8 vs. 1.9%; p = 0.006). After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, the difference in citations and mentions was no longer statistically significant. However, drug trials remained more likely to be stopped prematurely (adjusted odds ratio = 1.15; 95% confidence interval 1.03–1.28; p = 0.009). Positive study outcomes significantly influenced the number of citations and the likelihood of a trial being stopped prematurely. Drug trials are often stopped early and receive more citations and mentions than device trials. However, these differences are mainly due to factors other than the treatment itself. Studies published simultaneously tend to get more attention, and drug trials with positive results are cited more often than those with neutral results.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is the most widely used oral antihyperglycemic agent for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite the possible benefits of metformin on diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF), acute or unstable HF remains a precaution for its use. The aim of the present prospective randomized controlled trial was to assess whether metformin treatment has beneficial effects on patients with T2DM with hypertension without overt HF. A total of 164 patients (92 males, 72 females; median age 66 years) were included in this study. Patients with T2DM with a history of hypertension were randomized 1:1 to treatment for 1 year with either metformin (metformin-treated group) or other hypoglycemic agents (control group). The primary endpoints were changes in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, left ventricular (LV) mass index, and indicators of LV diastolic function. We also evaluated changes in both clinical findings and blood laboratory examination data. We observed no significant changes between baseline and 1-year post-treatment in LV mass index, BNP levels, or E/e′ (early diastolic transmitral flow velocity/early diastolic mitral annular velocity; an indicator of LV diastolic function) in either the metformin-treated (n = 83) or the control (n = 81) groups. The metformin-treated group had a significant reduction of body mass index (BMI) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), but the control group did not. We determined that renal function, including serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, deteriorated significantly in the control group but not in the metformin-treated group. LV mass and diastolic function were not affected after 1 year of metformin treatment in patients with T2DM. However, we observed benefits in terms of reductions in both BMI and LDL-C levels and preservation of renal function. UMIN000006504. Registered 7 October 2011.",

Our objectives were to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses of alirocumab in healthy Chinese subjects. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I study, 35 Chinese subjects (aged 21–45 years) with baseline LDL-C > 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) were randomized to receive a single 1 mL subcutaneous injection of alirocumab 75, 150, or 300 mg, or placebo, and followed up for ~ 12 weeks. Treatment-emergent adverse events, most frequently nasal congestion and dry throat, were reported in three of seven or eight subjects in each alirocumab dose group (two of seven in the placebo group). One patient receiving alirocumab 300 mg had a mild local injection-site reaction. No alirocumab recipients demonstrated antidrug antibodies. Maximum alirocumab serum concentrations (6–34 mg/dL) occurred at a median of 3–7 days across the dose groups. Maximum mean LDL-C reductions from baseline were observed on days 8, 15, and 22 with alirocumab 75 (55.3%), 150 (63.7%), and 300 mg (73.7%), respectively. Mean free PCSK9 levels were reduced to below the lower limit of quantification within 4 h of dosing. Total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B were reduced with alirocumab. In Chinese subjects, alirocumab 75, 150, and 300 mg was safe and well-tolerated. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, including clinically meaningful reductions in LDL-C and other lipids/lipoproteins, were consistent with data from Japanese and Western populations.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate a US hospital's cost implications and outcomes of cangrelor use in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients with two or more angiographic high-risk features (HRFs), including avoidance of oral P2Y12 inhibitor pretreatment in patients requiring cardiac surgery. Intravenous cangrelor provides direct, immediate onset and rapid-offset P2Y12 inhibition, which may reduce the necessity for oral P2Y12 pretreatment. A decision analytic model was developed, estimating the annual impact over 3 years of cangrelor availability. Ischemic and bleeding events (48 h) from randomized clinical trial data were extrapolated to 30 days. Event costs were from the CHAMPION PHOENIX Economics substudy. Rates of coronary artery disease (CAD) presentation, PCI, oral P2Y12 pretreatment, and inpatient hospitalization costs were from published literature and clinical experts. Scenario analyses evaluated the impact of cangrelor availability on potential reduced P2Y12 pretreatment rates by 50–100%. Drug costs were 2019 wholesale acquisition costs and, where necessary, all costs were adjusted to 2019 dollars. In a hospital treating 1000 CAD PCI inpatients annually, increasing cangrelor use from 11 to 32% resulted in a reduction in 48-h ischemic events/year by 5.7%, while bleeding events increased by 2.9%. Total costs of $1,135,472 declined 12.8%, with a 50% reduction in P2Y12 pretreatment or 30% with no pretreatment. Savings were driven by a decrease in ischemic events, decrease in glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use, and less need for and shorter oral P2Y12 inhibitor washout period for surgery patients. Use of cangrelor in patients with two or more angiographic HRFs may improve outcomes and lower hospital budgets, mainly from avoiding surgery delays necessitated by oral P2Y12 inhibitor pretreatment.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. AF-related strokes cause greater disability and mortality than those in patients without AF, and are associated with a significant clinical and economic burden in Mexico. Antithrombotic therapy reduces stroke risk in patients with AF and is recommended for all patients except those classified as having a low stroke risk. However, its use is suboptimal all around the world; one study showed that only 4 % of Mexican patients with AF who presented with ischemic stroke were in the therapeutic range for anticoagulation. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin or acenocoumarin have long been the only oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in AF. Although effective, VKAs have disadvantages, including the need for regular coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment. Interactions with numerous common medications and foods contribute to the risk of serious bleeding and thrombotic events in VKA-treated patients. Thus novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), more properly called direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban (not available in Mexico), have been developed. These offer the convenience of fixed-dose treatment without the need for monitoring, and have few drug or food interactions. Pivotal phase III trials have demonstrated that these agents are at least as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke and are associated with a reduced risk of intracranial hemorrhage. With apixaban approved in Mexico in April 2013, clinicians now have the choice of three novel DOACs as alternatives to warfarin. However, it is yet to be established which of these agents should be the first choice, and treatment decisions are likely to depend on the individual patient's characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 enzyme plays a role in the metabolization of clopidogrel. Carriage of a CYP2C9 loss-of-function (LoF) allele has been associated with attenuated pharmacokinetics, leading to a diminished pharmacodynamic response and increased risk for developing stent thrombosis in patients treated with clopidogrel.In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of the CYP2C9*2 and *3 LoF alleles on thrombotic events. Therefore, a post hoc analysis was performed in 878 patients with available CYP2C9 genotype status included in the POPular Genetics and POPular Age trials, which enrolled patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, respectively. The primary thrombotic outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke.A total of 526 (60%) patients were CYP2C9 LoF allele noncarriers and 352 (40%) were CYP2C9 LoF allele (*2 or *3) carriers. After correction for differences in baseline characteristics, there were no significant differences between CYP2C9 LoF allele carriers and noncarriers for the combined thrombotic outcome (6.3% vs. 5.9%, hazard ratio 1.16 [0.67-2.0], p = 0.60), or the individual thrombotic outcomes. Moreover, no differences were seen in the event rates for clinically relevant bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC] 2-5 bleeding) as well as major bleeding (BARC 3 or 5 bleeding).Carriers of a CYP2C9 *2 or *3 LoF allele presenting with acute coronary syndrome and treated with clopidogrel did not have an increased risk for thrombotic events compared with noncarriers. Given the limited number of poor metabolizers, no firm conclusions could be drawn with regard to the thrombotic risk for patients carrying two CYP2C9 LoF alleles.",

    "abstract": "Dabigatran etexilate (DE) is an anticoagulant with proven efficacy and tolerability for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. For the commercial capsule, a complex formulation is used to maintain the acidic microenvironment required for maximal absorption. Consequently, its efficacy and safety are similar with or without concomitant intake of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). A simplified DE tablet formulation was developed and tested in two studies. One investigated bioequivalence (BE) of the novel DE tablet versus the commercial DE capsule. The other investigated DE bioavailability (BA) under pretreatment with the PPI rabeprazole and assessed the effect of elevated pH on exposure to dabigatran. BE of the novel DE tablet versus the DE capsule was assessed in a randomized two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence crossover study (NCT03070171). The effect of rabeprazole on the BA of the DE tablet was assessed in an open-label, single-arm study (NCT03143166). Both studies were conducted at sites in Japan. Participants were healthy male volunteers, aged ≥ 20–40 years. In the BE study, participants received the DE tablet or capsule (single oral dose, 110 mg); primary endpoints were area under the concentration–time curve from baseline to the last quantifiable data point (AUC0–tz) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of unconjugated dabigatran. In the relative BA study, participants received the DE tablet (single oral dose, 110 mg) with or without rabeprazole pretreatment (once daily for 5 days, 20 mg); primary endpoints were AUC0–tz and Cmax of total dabigatran. In total, 160 participants were randomized in the BE study; 36 participants were enrolled in the BA study. The 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean (gMean) ratios for AUC0–tz (101.4–116.0%) and Cmax (101.8–116.6%) of unconjugated dabigatran were within pre-defined acceptance criteria for BE. In the relative BA study, the gMeans of AUC0–tz (667 to 192 ng h/mL) and Cmax (83.1 to 21.8 ng/mL) were decreased by approximately 70% when the tablet was administered under rabeprazole pretreatment. The reduction in BA was observed at a mean gastric pH of 5.3. Treatment was well tolerated; no deaths, serious adverse events (AEs) or significant AEs were reported in either study. The DE tablet demonstrated BE to the capsule; however, at high gastric pH, BA of the tablet was reduced by approximately 70%, which may lead to reduced efficacy. Data indicate the importance of examining not only BE under standard conditions, but relative BA at elevated gastric pH. Such investigations may avoid the reduced BA at elevated pH that is quite common in the target population (the elderly and/or patients treated with gastric-acid modifying co-medications), and therefore reduce treatment failure with DE.

    "abstract": "Patients with chronic kidney disease are at an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban has been shown to provide similar efficacy and a lower risk of bleeding compared with vitamin K antagonists for the treatment and prevention of VTE. Rivaroxaban has been studied in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, and this review summarizes current knowledge supporting its use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] of 15 to < 30 mL/min) for the prevention, treatment, or prophylaxis of VTE. Clinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated an increase in rivaroxaban systemic exposure, factor Xa inhibition, and prothrombin time with decreasing renal function. These changes reach a plateau with comparable increases in exposure among individuals with moderate or severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease. The clinical development program for the treatment and prevention of VTE as well as prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following orthopedic surgery excluded patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min; however, a limited number of patients with severe renal impairment were enrolled. Efficacy outcomes in these patients with severe renal impairment were not meaningfully different from those of patients with higher levels of renal function. There was also no increase in the incidence of major bleeding with rivaroxaban in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min. Taken together, these pharmacological and clinical data suggest that in patients with severe renal impairment, the approved dosages of rivaroxaban can be used in the treatment and prevention of VTE and for prophylaxis of DVT after hip or knee replacement surgery.",

    "abstract": "In the 2020 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS), the experts proposed to put an end to the equipoise of ticagrelor and prasugrel in addition to aspirin in patients with NSTE-ACS who proceed to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). They gave a strong level of recommendation (IIa) in favor of prasugrel over ticagrelor in these patients. We challenge this proposition, which was mainly driven by the results of ISAR-REACT 5, an open-label prospective head-to-head study of a prasugrel-based strategy compared with a ticagrelor-based strategy in patients with ACS undergoing PCI. In addition to the methodological concerns regarding the ISAR-REACT 5 study, we also question this decision in light of the ISAR-REACT 5 diabetes mellitus subgroup analysis and previous studies and meta-analysis that showed no difference between ticagrelor and prasugrel in patients with ACS. Although we agree with the \"one size does not fit all\" concept for antiplatelet regimens in patients with ACS who proceed to PCI, we believe that the decision to strongly favor prasugrel was premature and not supported enough by the ISAR-REACT 5 results. In our opinion, equipoise remains between the ticagrelor- and prasugrel-based strategies and more data are needed to settle the debate.",

    "abstract": "Antithrombotic therapy is the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the acute management of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients includes therapy for pain relief and potential additional strategies for cardioprotection. The safety and efficacy of some commonly used treatments have been questioned by recent evidence. Indeed a concern about morphine use is the interaction between opioids and oral P2Y12 inhibitors; early beta-blocker treatment has shown conflicting results for the improvement of clinical outcomes; and supplemental oxygen therapy lacks benefit in patients without hypoxia and may be of potential harm. Other additional strategies remain disappointing; however, some treatments may be selectively used. Therefore, we intend to present a critical updated review of complementary pharmacotherapy for a modern treatment approach for STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, is associated with a substantial healthcare and economic burden. Reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to guideline-recommended goals is crucial in the prevention or management of ASCVD, particularly in those at high risk. Despite the availability of several effective lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs), up to 80% of patients with ASCVD do not reach evidence-based LDL-C goals. This nonattainment may be due to poor adherence to, and lack of timely utilization of, LLTs driven by a range of variables, including polypharmacy, side effects, clinical inertia, costs, and access issues. Inclisiran was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2021 as a novel, twice-yearly, healthcare provider (HCP)-administered LLT. In-office administration allows HCPs more control of drug acquisition, administration, and reimbursement, and may allow for more timely care and increased patient monitoring. In the USA, in-office administered drugs are considered a Medical Benefit and can be acquired and reimbursed using the \"buy-and-bill\" process. Buy-and-bill is a standard system for medication administration already established in multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology, vaccines, and allergy/immunology. Initiating in-office administration will involve new considerations for clinicians in the cardiovascular specialty, such as the implementation of new infrastructure and processes; however, it could ultimately increase treatment adherence and improve cardiovascular outcomes for patients with ASCVD. This article discusses the potential implications of buy-and-bill for the cardiology specialty and provides a practical guide to implementing HCP-administered specialty drugs in US clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) trial was conducted to study cardiovascular outcomes of treatment with evolocumab. The trial was terminated after a median follow-up of 2.2 years instead of the planned 3.6 years. We question this decision. According to the investigators, the event rate was 50% higher than expected. However, the accrued number of key secondary events (1829) was only 12% higher than the targeted number (1630). Also, around one-third of the events consisted of non-atherosclerotic myocardial infarctions, hemorrhagic strokes, and cardiovascular deaths unrelated to myocardial infarction or stroke. Moreover, halfway through the trial, the sample size changed from 22,500 to 27,500, even though the accrual of the targeted number of events was on track. Finally, the rate of all-cause mortality had started to diverge in favor of placebo after 2 years of follow-up. It was 4.8% for evolocumab and 4.3% for placebo in participants with > 2.5 years of follow-up. A long-term follow-up would have yielded more events and thus more power to evaluate the effect of evolocumab on all-cause mortality. We conclude that adaptive designs carry a recognized risk of false-positive efficacy results, but the risk of false-negative safety results is underappreciated.",

    "abstract": "Sacubitril/valsartan (S/V) improves outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Data about the immediate, short-, and intermediate-term hemodynamic effects of S/V are limited. In this prospective observational study, 37 outpatients with chronic HFrEF were treated with S/V according to current guideline recommendations. Next to clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters, haemodynamic variables were assessed non-invasively by use of inert gas rebreathing and bioimpedance cardiography at baseline and at 2-week, 3-month and 6-month follow-up. The course of variables throughout the study and the relationship between variables were analysed using fractional polynomials. S/V treatment resulted in short- and intermediate-term improvements in NYHA functional class (2.3 ± 0.6 at baseline vs. 1.9 ± 0.5 at 6-month follow-up, p = 0.14), 6-min walk test (453 ± 110 vs. 528 ± 98 m, p = 0.02), ejection fraction (31 ± 9 vs. 36 ± 12%, p = 0.13), pulmonary artery pressure (39 ± 10 vs. 31 ± 10 mmHg, p = 0.02), and NT-proBNP values (1702 (782–2897 vs. 1004 (599–1627) ng/L, p = 0.03). In addition, S/V caused immediate decreases in systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and systolic blood pressure (SBP), which were associated with a simultaneous drop in stroke volume (SV) and cardiac index (CI). However, while SVRI and SBP remained at low levels during further treatment, SV and CI restored rapidly and increased to slightly higher levels thereafter. The vasodilative effects of S/V result in immediate reductions in SVRI, SBP, SV and CI. However, S/V induces reverse cardiac remodelling, which is apparent shortly after treatment initiation and leads to improvements of clinical, functional, echocardiographic, laboratory and haemodynamic variables.",

    "abstract": "Controversy exists regarding the indication of beta-blockers (BB) in different scenarios in patients with cardiovascular disease. We sought to evaluate the effect of BB on survival and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in a sample of pacemaker-dependent patients after AV node ablation to control ventricular rate for atrial tachyarrhythmias.A retrospective study including consecutive patients that underwent AV node ablation was conducted in a single center between 2011 and 2019. The study's primary endpoints were the incidence of all-cause mortality, first HF hospitalization and the cumulative incidence of subsequent hospitalizations for HF. Competing risk analyses were employed.A total of 111 patients with a mean age of 73.9 years were included in the study. After a median follow-up of 45.5 months, 43 patients had died (38.7%) and 31 had been hospitalized for HF (27.9%). The recurrent HF hospitalization rate was 74/1000 patients/year. Patients treated with BB had a non-significant trend to higher mortality rates and a higher risk of recurrent HF hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio 2.23, 95% confidence interval 1.12-4.44; p = 0.023).After an AV node ablation, the use of BB is associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalizations in a cohort of elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Antithrombotic drugs, including the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor, increase the risk of perioperative bleeding in patients requiring urgent cardiac surgery. Perioperative bleeding can lead to increased mortality and prolong intensive care unit and hospital stays. A novel sorbent-filled hemoperfusion cartridge that intraoperatively removes ticagrelor via hemoadsorption can reduce the risk of perioperative bleeding. We estimated the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of using this device versus standard practices to reduce the risk of perioperative bleeding during and after coronary artery bypass grafting from the US healthcare sector perspective.We used a Markov model to analyze the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the hemoadsorption device in three cohorts: (1) surgery within 1 day from last ticagrelor dose; (2) surgery between 1 and 2 days from last ticagrelor dose; and (3) a combined cohort. The model analyzed costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were interpreted as both incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits (NMBs) at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000/QALY. We analyzed parameter uncertainty using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.The hemoadsorption device was dominant for each cohort. Patients with less than 1 day of washout in the device arm gained 0.017 QALYs at a savings of $1748 (USD), for an NMB of $3434. In patients with 1-2 days of washout, the device arm yielded 0.014 QALYs and a cost savings of $151, for an NMB of $1575. In the combined cohort, device gained 0.016 QALYs and a savings of $950 for an NMB of $2505. Per-member-per-month cost savings associated with device was estimated to be $0.02 for a one-million-member health plan.This model found the hemoadsorption device to provide better clinical and economic outcomes compared with the standard of care in patients who required surgery within 2 days of ticagrelor discontinuation. Given the increasing use of ticagrelor in patients with acute coronary syndrome, incorporating this novel device may represent an important part of any bundle to save costs and reduce harm.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Current international guidelines recommend antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation (CA) as rhythm-control strategies for AF. This study aimed to comprehensively assess economic evaluations (EEs) of the treatment of AF by country income level. Seven electronic databases were systematically searched for EE literature until March 30, 2024, with no constraints on time or language. Two independent reviewers selected the studies, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of the data. Full EEs comparing CA with antiarrhythmic drugs for rhythm-control treatment were included; surgical or rate-control treatments were excluded. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the ECOBIAS checklist. Costs were converted to purchasing power parity US dollars for 2023. A random-effects meta-analysis was applied to pool incremental net benefit (INB) based on a heterogeneity test and its degree (I2 > 25% or Cochran's Q test < 0.1). We also explored heterogeneity and potential publication bias and conducted sensitivity and subgroup analyses. In total, 27 studies across nine countries were eligible, predominantly from high-income countries (n = 25), with a smaller subset from upper-middle-income countries (n = 2). Because of the heterogeneity among the studies, a random-effects model was selected over a fixed-effects model to pool INBs. Most studies (n = 21) favored CA as the cost-effective intervention, yielding an INB of $US23,796 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15,341–32,251) in high-income countries. However, heterogeneity was substantial (I2 = 99.67%). In upper-middle-income countries, the estimated INB was $US18,330 (95% CI − 11,900–48,526). The publication bias results showed no evidence of asymmetrical funnel plots. In this meta-analysis, CA emerged as a cost-effective rhythm-control treatment for AF when compared with antiarrhythmic drugs, particularly in high-income countries. However, economic evidence for upper-middle-income countries is lacking, and no primary evaluations were found for low-middle-income and low-income countries. Further EEs are necessary to expand the understanding of AF treatment globally.",

Comprehensive pharmacological treatment of AF includes medications for rate or rhythm control and anticoagulants to reduce the risk of thromboembolism; yet, these agents have significant limitations. Oral anti-arrhythmic agents have a slow onset of action, and rapid onset formulations require hospitalization for intravenous therapy. Orally administered drugs also require high doses to attain therapeutic levels, and thus dose-related severe adverse effects are often unavoidable. Given the therapeutic benefits of inhaled drug delivery, including rapid onset of action and very low doses to achieve therapeutic efficacy, this review will discuss the benefits of novel pulmonary delivery of drugs for the management of AF.",

In this open-label, randomized, parallel-group study, healthy adults were randomized into three groups to receive mavacamten 15 mg alone or mavacamten 15 mg plus activated charcoal 50 g administered either 2 h or 6 h after mavacamten dosing. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from plasma concentration–time data using noncompartmental methods. Of the 45 participants randomized, 37 completed the study. When activated charcoal was administered 2 h after mavacamten dosing, mavacamten absorption and exposure were reduced compared with when mavacamten was administered alone: the area under the concentration–time curve from 0 to 72 h (AUC0–72) and area under the concentration–time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUCINF) were reduced by 14% and 34%, respectively. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was also slightly lower when activated charcoal was administered 2 h after mavacamten dosing than with mavacamten alone. Pharmacokinetic profiles were similar for mavacamten alone and mavacamten plus activated charcoal administered 6 h after mavacamten dosing. Activated charcoal was successful in reducing mavacamten absorption and exposure when administered as soon as possible after identification of a need for adsorption (2 h after mavacamten dosing). No change in exposure was observed when activated charcoal was administered 6 h after mavacamten dosing. NCT05320094",

    "abstract": "Apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant is administered for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients. Dosing adjustment is guided by renal function, age, and body weight. However, no data exist on its pharmacokinetics in patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m2. The aim was to investigate the effects of BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 on trough plasma concentrations of apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation. This prospective study compared steady-state trough concentrations of apixaban in patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 and patients with a BMI < 35 kg/m2. Sixty patients were included. In patients receiving 5 mg apixaban twice daily, the median trough plasma concentration was 29% lower in patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 than in those with a BMI < 35 kg/m2 (148.9 ng/ml, interquartile range [IQR] 94.5–205.6, compared to 209.1 ng/ml, IQR 167–266.8 ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.044). However, median trough concentrations fell within the manufacturer's predicted range for effective steady-state apixaban exposure. A similar trend was observed with 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily, although statistical significance was not reached. Multivariate analysis revealed no correlation between BMI values and trough concentrations. BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 patients exhibited lower apixaban trough concentrations, while remaining within the manufacturer's established range for effective steady-state apixaban, suggesting that dose adjustment is unnecessary for this specific patient group.",

    "abstract": "Ivabradine improves cardiac function and clinical outcomes in chronic heart failure (HF) by reducing heart rate (HR), but there is a lack of real-world data on its effectiveness and safety in Chinese patients. We designed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of Chinese adults with HF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting HR ≥ 75 beats per minute (bpm), and an indication for ivabradine treatment. An interim analysis was performed using a cut-off date of 31 October 2019. The primary outcome was change in HR at 6 months after the initiation of ivabradine. Secondary endpoints included change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class; quality of life (QoL), measured using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ); and adverse events (AEs). Overall, 655 subjects were included in the interim analysis. Mean reduction in HR from baseline was 13.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.2–15.2) bpm at Month 1, and 14.5 (95% CI 11.8–17.2) bpm at Month 6 (p < 0.001 for both changes). NYHA functional class and KCCQ scores improved significantly over time (p < 0.001 for all comparisons with baseline), indicating amelioration of symptoms and better QoL, respectively. Forty-four subjects (6.7%) reported a total of 60 ivabradine-related AEs, most frequently phosphenes and bradycardia (both n = 6, 0.9%). Treatment with ivabradine for 6 months effectively reduced HR and improved functional class and QoL in Chinese patients with chronic HF. Treatment was well tolerated.

    "abstract": "We previously conducted a retrospective cohort study using chart review of oral anticoagulant-naïve Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) that assessed the risk of major bleeding and stroke/systemic embolism (SE) events of apixaban versus warfarin.In this subgroup analysis, we compared the risk of major bleeding and stroke/SE events by stratifying patients into four subgroups matched 1:1 using propensity score matching (PSM) according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl; mL/min): ≥ 15 to < 30, ≥ 30 to < 50, ≥ 50 to < 80, and ≥ 80.Of the 7074 patients in the apixaban group and 4998 in the warfarin group eligible for inclusion in the analysis, 4385 were included in each group after PSM. Incidence rates of major bleeding and stroke/SE events were generally lower with apixaban versus warfarin across the CrCl subgroups. When all patients with a CrCl change of < 0 mL/min per year during the study period (apixaban, n = 3871; warfarin, n = 2635) were stratified into four subgroups based on the magnitude of CrCl decline (median CrCl change [mL/min] per year: - 1.09, - 3.48, - 7.54, and - 36.92 for apixaban, and - 1.10, - 3.65, - 7.85, and - 40.40 for warfarin), the incidence rates of major bleeding and stroke/SE events generally increased with an increasing CrCl decline per year in both groups.In Japanese patients with NVAF, the safety and effectiveness of apixaban and warfarin were consistent across different renal subgroups, including those with severe renal impairment. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring renal function variations over time in patients with NVAF.NCT03765242.",
