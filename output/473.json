    "abstract": "The Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Over the past two decades, the Villefranche Nosology, which delineated six subtypes, has been widely used as the standard for clinical diagnosis of EDS. For most of these subtypes, mutations had been identified in collagen-encoding genes, or in genes encoding collagen-modifying enzymes. Since its publication in 1998, a whole spectrum of novel EDS subtypes has been described, and mutations have been identified in an array of novel genes. The International EDS Consortium proposes a revised EDS classification, which recognizes 13 subtypes. For each of the subtypes, we propose a set of clinical criteria that are suggestive for the diagnosis. However, in view of the vast genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability of the EDS subtypes, and the clinical overlap between EDS subtypes, but also with other HCTDs, the definite diagnosis of all EDS subtypes, except for the hypermobile type, relies on molecular confirmation with identification of (a) causative genetic variant(s). We also revised the clinical criteria for hypermobile EDS in order to allow for a better distinction from other joint hypermobility disorders. To satisfy research needs, we also propose a pathogenetic scheme, that regroups EDS subtypes for which the causative proteins function within the same pathway. We hope that the revised International EDS Classification will serve as a new standard for the diagnosis of EDS and will provide a framework for future research purposes.",

Family studies have documented that first‐degree relatives of affected individuals have an excess risk of the disorder, while twin studies (and to a lesser extent, adoption studies) suggest that genes are largely responsible for this familial aggregation. We review these studies, including the magnitude of familial risk and heritability estimates, efforts to identify familial subtypes of bipolar disorder, and the implications of family/genetic data for validating nosologic boundaries. Taken together, these studies indicate that bipolar disorder is phenotypically and genetically complex. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Suicidal behavior is highly familial, and on the basis of twin and adoption studies, heritable as well. Both completed and attempted suicide form part of the clinical phenotype that is familially transmitted, as rates of suicide attempt are elevated in the family members of suicide completers, and completion rates are elevated in the family members of attempters. A family history of suicidal behavior is associated with suicidal behavior in the proband, even after adjusting for presence of psychiatric disorders in the proband and family, indicating transmission of attempt that is distinct from family transmission of psychiatric disorder. Impulsive aggression in probands and family members is associated with family loading for suicidal behavior, and may contribute to familial transmission of suicidal behavior. Shared environment effects such as abuse, imitation, or transmission of psychopathology are other possible explanations. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

There is substantial phenotypic diversity in individuals with these birth defects and their family members: from subclinical phenotypes to associated syndromic features that is mirrored by the many genes that contribute to the etiology of these disorders. Identification of these genes and loci has been the result of decades of research using multiple genetic approaches. Significant progress has been made recently due to advances in sequencing and genotyping technologies, primarily through the use of whole exome sequencing and genome-wide association studies. Future progress will hinge on identifying functional variants, investigation of pathway and other interactions, and inclusion of phenotypic and ethnic diversity in studies.",

    "abstract": "Carnitine plays an essential role in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This transfer requires enzymes and transporters that accumulate carnitine within the cell (OCTN2 carnitine transporter), conjugate it with long chain fatty acids (carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, CPT1), transfer the acylcarnitine across the inner plasma membrane (carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase, CACT), and conjugate the fatty acid back to Coenzyme A for subsequent beta oxidation (carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2, CPT2). Deficiency of the OCTN2 carnitine transporter causes primary carnitine deficiency, characterized by increased losses of carnitine in the urine and decreased carnitine accumulation in tissues. Patients can present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and hepatic encephalopathy, or with skeletal and cardiac myopathy. This disease responds to carnitine supplementation. Defects in the liver isoform of CPT1 present with recurrent attacks of fasting hypoketotic hypoglycemia. The heart and the muscle, which express a genetically distinct form of CPT1, are usually unaffected. These patients can have elevated levels of plasma carnitine. CACT deficiency presents in most cases in the neonatal period with hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and cardiomyopathy with arrhythmia leading to cardiac arrest. Plasma carnitine levels are extremely low. Deficiency of CPT2 present more frequently in adults with rhabdomyolysis triggered by prolonged exercise. More severe variants of CPT2 deficiency present in the neonatal period similarly to CACT deficiency associated or not with multiple congenital anomalies. Treatment for deficiency of CPT1, CPT2, and CACT consists in a low-fat diet supplemented with medium chain triglycerides that can be metabolized by mitochondria independently from carnitine, carnitine supplements, and avoidance of fasting and sustained exercise.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, growing attention has been placed on joint hypermobility and related disorders. The new nosology for Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), the best‐known and probably the most common of the disorders featuring joint hypermobility, identifies more than 20 different types of EDS, and highlights the need for a single set of criteria to substitute the previous ones for the overlapping EDS hypermobility type and joint hypermobility syndrome. Joint hypermobility is a feature commonly encountered in many other disorders, both genetic and acquired, and this finding is attracting the attention of an increasing number of medical and non‐medical disciplines. In this paper, the terminology of joint hypermobility and related disorders is summarized. Different types of joint hypermobility, its secondary musculoskeletal manifestations and a simplified categorization of genetic syndromes featuring joint hypermobility are presented. The concept of a spectrum of pathogenetically related manifestations of joint hypermobility intersecting the categories of pleiotropic syndromes with joint hypermobility is introduced. A group of hypermobility spectrum disorders is proposed as diagnostic labels for patients with symptomatic joint hypermobility but not corresponding to any other syndromes with joint hypermobility. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

It has been described largely in those with musculoskeletal complaints including joint hypermobility, joint subluxations/dislocations, as well as skin and soft tissue manifestations. Many patients report activity‐related pain and some go on to have daily pain. Two undifferentiated syndromes have been used to describe these manifestations—joint hypermobility syndrome and hEDS. Both are clinical diagnoses in the absence of other causation. Current medical literature further complicates differentiation and describes multiple associated symptoms and disorders. The current EDS nosology combines these two entities into the hypermobile type of EDS.

    "abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) commonly possess unique neurocognitive and neurobehavioral profiles that emerge within specific developmental periods. These profiles are distinct relative to others with similar intellectual disability (ID) and reflect underlying neuroanatomic findings, providing support for a distinctive phenotypic profile. This review updates what is known about the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes associated with DS across the lifespan. In early childhood, mild deviations from neurotypically developing trajectories emerge. By school‐age, delays become pronounced. Nonverbal skills remain on trajectory for mental age, whereas verbal deficits emerge and persist. Nonverbal learning and memory are strengths relative to verbal skills. Expressive language is delayed relative to comprehension. Aspects of language skills continue to develop throughout adolescence, although language skills remain compromised in adulthood. Deficits in attention/executive functions are present in childhood and become more pronounced with age. Characteristic features associated with DS (cheerful, social nature) are personality assets. Children are at a lower risk for psychopathology compared to other children with ID; families report lower levels of stress and a more positive outlook. In youth, externalizing behaviors may be problematic, whereas a shift toward internalizing behaviors emerges with maturity. Changes in emotional/behavioral functioning in adulthood are typically associated with neurodegeneration and individuals with DS are higher risk for dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Individuals with DS possess many unique strengths and weaknesses that should be appreciated as they develop across the lifespan. Awareness of this profile by professionals and caregivers can promote early detection and support cognitive and behavioral development. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We reviewed the safety during pregnancy of 172 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2000 to 2010 using the TERIS risk rating system. We also reviewed safety information for 468 drugs approved by the FDA from 1980 to 2000 to determine if revisions in risk categories had been made in the last 10 years. The teratogenic risk in human pregnancy was “undetermined” for 168 (97.7%) of drug treatments approved between 2000 and 2010. Furthermore, the amount of data available regarding safety in pregnancy was rated as “none” for 126 (73.3%) of these drugs. For those drugs approved between 1980 and 2000, only 23 (5%) changed a full risk category or more in the past 10 years. Sources of data that led to a revised risk were derived from exposure cohort studies performed through record linkage studies, teratogen information services, large population‐based case‐control studies, and pregnancy registries. The mean time for a treatment initially classified as having an “undetermined” risk to be assigned a more precise risk was 27 years (95% confidence interval 26–28 years). The lack of information needed to assess the safety of drug treatments during human pregnancy remains a serious public health problem.

In vertebrates, such motile cilia are evident in the respiratory epithelia, ependyma, and oviducts. For over a century, non‐motile cilia have been observed on the surface of most vertebrate cells but until recently their function has eluded us. Gathering evidence now points to critical roles for the mono‐cilium in sensing the extracellular environment, and perturbation of this function gives rise to a predictable panoply of clinical problems.

The frequency is estimated as 1/50,000–1/200,000 and results from pathogenic variants in COL3A1, which encodes the chains of type III procollagen, a major protein in vessel walls and hollow organs. Initial diagnosis depends on the recognitions of clinical features, including family history. Management is complex and requires multiple specialists who can respond to and manage the major complications. A summary of recommendations for management include: Identify causative variants in COL3A1 prior to application of diagnosis, modulate life style to minimize injury, risk of vessel/organ rupture, identify and create care team, provide individual plans for emergency care (“vascular EDS passport”) with diagnosis and management plan for use when traveling, centralize management at centers of excellence (experience) when feasible, maintain blood pressure in the normal range and treat hypertension aggressively, surveillance of vascular tree by doppler ultrasound, CTA (low radiation alternatives) or MRA if feasible on an annual basis. These recommendations represent a consensus of an international group of specialists with a broad aggregate experience in the care of individuals with vascular EDS that will need to be assessed on a regular basis as new information develops. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are two distinct neurogenetic disorders in which imprinted genes on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 are affected. Although the SNORD116 gene cluster has become a prime candidate for PWS, it cannot be excluded that other paternally expressed genes in the chromosomal region 15q11q13 contribute to the full phenotype. AS is caused by a deficiency of the UBE3A gene, which in the brain is expressed from the maternal allele only. The most frequent genetic lesions in both disorders are a de novo deletion of the chromosomal region 15q11q13, uniparental disomy 15, an imprinting defect or, in the case of AS, a mutation of the UBE3A gene. Microdeletions in a small number of patients with PWS and AS have led to the identification of the chromosome 15 imprinting center (IC). The IC consists of two critical elements, which act in cis to regulate imprinting in the whole chromosome 15q11q13 imprinted domain. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Approximately 85% of reported BWS cases are sporadic, while the remaining 15% are familial. BWS is caused by epigenetic or genomic alterations which disrupt genes in one or both of the two imprinted domains on chromosome 11p15.5. In each domain, an imprinting center regulates the expression of imprinted genes in cis. Normally in domain 1, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and the untranslated mRNA H19 are monoallelically expressed. In BWS, increased expression of IGF2 occurs via several mechanisms. In domain 2, CDKN1C, a growth repressor, and an untranslated RNA, KCNQ1OT1, are normally expressed monoallelically. In cases of BWS, several mechanisms result in reduced expression of CDKN1C. Recent reports of BWS cases have identified mutations outside the chromosome 11p15.5 critical region, thereby broadening the challenges in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of individuals and families with BWS.",

Through the PG4KDS protocol, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital pre-emptively genotypes patients for 230 genes using the Affymetrix Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters (DMET) Plus array supplemented with a CYP2D6 copy number assay. The PG4KDS protocol provides a rational, stepwise process for implementing gene/drug pairs, organizing data, and obtaining consent from patients and families. Through August 2013, 1,559 patients have been enrolled, and four gene tests have been released into the electronic health record (EHR) for clinical implementation: TPMT, CYP2D6, SLCO1B1, and CYP2C19. These genes are coupled to 12 high-risk drugs. Of the 1,016 patients with genotype test results available, 78% of them had at least one high-risk (i.e., actionable) genotype result placed in their EHR. Each diplotype result released to the EHR is coupled with an interpretive consult that is created in a concise, standardized format. To support-gene based prescribing at the point of care, 55 interruptive clinical decision support (CDS) alerts were developed. Patients are informed of their genotyping result and its relevance to their medication use through a letter. Key elements necessary for our successful implementation have included strong institutional support, a knowledgeable clinical laboratory, a process to manage any incidental findings, a strategy to educate clinicians and patients, a process to return results, and extensive use of informatics, especially CDS. Our approach to pre-emptive clinical pharmacogenetics has proven feasible, clinically useful, and scalable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the last 10 years, the primary cilia machinery has been implicated in more than a dozen disorders united as ciliopathies, including skeletal dysplasias, such as Jeune syndrome and short rib‐polydactyly type III. Indeed, primary cilia play a vital role in transduction of signals in the hedgehog pathway that is especially important in skeletal development. In this review, we focus on skeletal conditions belonging to the ciliopathy group: the short rib‐polydactyly group (SRPs) that includes Verma–Naumoff syndrome (SRP type III), Majewski syndrome (SRP type II), Jeune syndrome (ATD), as well as Ellis–van Creveld syndrome (EVC), the Sensenbrenner syndrome, and, finally, Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Today, 10 different genes have been identified as responsible for seven “skeletal” ciliopathies. Mutations have been identified in dynein motor ( DYNC2H1 ), in intraflagellar transport (IFT) complexes ( IFT80 , IFT122 , IFT43 , WDR35 , WDR19 , and TTC21B ) as well as in genes responsible for the basal body ( NEK1 , EVC , and EVC2 ). The wide clinical variability observed for an individual ciliopathy gene supports the development of exome strategy specifically dedicated to cilia genes to identify mutations in this particularly heterogeneous group of disorders. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays an essential role in regulation of normal cell growth, metabolism, and survival. Somatic activating mutations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are among the most common mutations identified in cancer, and have been shown to cause a spectrum of overgrowth syndromes including PIK3CA‐Related Overgrowth Spectrum, Proteus syndrome, and brain overgrowth conditions. Clinical findings in these disorders may be isolated or multiple, including sporadic or mosaic overgrowth (adipose, skeletal, muscle, brain, vascular, or lymphatic), and skin abnormalities (including epidermal nevi, hyper‐, and hypopigmented lesions), and have the potential risk of tumorigenesis. Key negative regulators of the PI3K‐AKT signaling pathway include PTEN and TSC1/TSC2 and germline loss‐of function mutations of these genes are established to cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. Mosaic forms of these conditions lead to increased activation of PI3K and mTOR at affected sites and there is phenotypic overlap between these conditions. All are associated with significant morbidity with limited options for treatment other than symptomatic therapies and surgeries. As dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway has been implicated in cancer, several small molecule inhibitors targeting different components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway are under clinical investigation. The development of these therapies brings closer the prospect of targeting treatment for somatic PI3K/AKT/mTOR‐related overgrowth syndromes. This review describes the clinical findings, gene function and pathogenesis of these mosaic overgrowth syndromes, and presents existing and future treatment strategies to reduce or prevent associated complications of these disorders. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The Ehlers–Danlos syndromes comprise a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders, which are characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue friability. In the Villefranche Nosology, six subtypes were recognized: The classical, hypermobile, vascular, kyphoscoliotic, arthrochalasis, and dermatosparaxis subtypes of EDS. Except for the hypermobile subtype, defects had been identified in fibrillar collagens or in collagen‐modifying enzymes. Since 1997, a whole spectrum of novel, clinically overlapping, rare EDS‐variants have been delineated and genetic defects have been identified in an array of other extracellular matrix genes. Advances in molecular testing have made it possible to now identify the causative mutation for many patients presenting these phenotypes. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the current knowledge on the rare EDS subtypes and highlight areas for future research. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

These advances have further delineated intricate (epi)genetic regulation of the imprinted gene cluster on chromosome 11p15.5 and the role of these genes in normal growth and development. Studies of the molecular changes associated with the BWS phenotype have been instrumental in elucidating critical molecular elements in this imprinted region.

Phenotypic expression is highly variable and ranges from severe life‐threatening conditions to only a few associated features. Most common medical problems include: congenital heart disease, in particular conotruncal anomalies; palatal abnormalities, most frequently velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI); immunodeficiency; hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism; genitourinary anomalies; severe feeding/gastrointestinal differences; and subtle dysmorphic facial features. The neurocognitive profile is also highly variable, both between individuals and during the course of development. From infancy onward, motor delays (often with hypotonia) and speech/language deficits are commonly observed. During the preschool and primary school ages, learning difficulties are very common. The majority of patients with 22q11.2DS have an intellectual level that falls in the borderline range (IQ 70–84), and about one‐third have mild to moderate intellectual disability. More severe levels of intellectual disability are uncommon in children and adolescents but are more frequent in adults. Individuals with 22q11.2DS are at an increased risk for developing several psychiatric disorders including attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety and mood disorders, and psychotic disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we will focus on the developmental phenotypic transitions regarding cognitive development in 22q11.2DS from early preschool to adulthood, and on the changing behavioral/psychiatric phenotype across age, on a background of frequently complex medical conditions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin extensibility, and tissue fragility. This communication briefly reports upon the neurological manifestations that arise including the weakness of the ligaments of the craniocervical junction and spine, early disc degeneration, and the weakness of the epineurium and perineurium surrounding peripheral nerves. Entrapment, deformation, and biophysical deformative stresses exerted upon the nervous system may alter gene expression, neuronal function and phenotypic expression. This report also discusses increased prevalence of migraine, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, Tarlov cysts, tethered cord syndrome, and dystonia, where associations with EDS have been anecdotally reported, but where epidemiological evidence is not yet available. Chiari Malformation Type I (CMI) has been reported to be a comorbid condition to EDS, and may be complicated by craniocervical instability or basilar invagination. Motor delay, headache, and quadriparesis have been attributed to ligamentous laxity and instability at the atlanto‐occipital and atlantoaxial joints, which may complicate all forms of EDS. Discopathy and early degenerative spondylotic disease manifest by spinal segmental instability and kyphosis, rendering EDS patients prone to mechanical pain, and myelopathy. Musculoskeletal pain starts early, is chronic and debilitating, and the neuromuscular disease of EDS manifests symptomatically with weakness, myalgia, easy fatigability, limited walking, reduction of vibration sense, and mild impairment of mobility and daily activities. Consensus criteria and clinical practice guidelines, based upon stronger epidemiological and pathophysiological evidence, are needed to refine diagnosis and treatment of the various neurological and spinal manifestations of EDS. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The purpose was to perform a systematic review of clinical assessment methods for classifying Generalized Joint Hypermobility (GJH), evaluate their clinimetric properties, and perform the best evidence synthesis of these methods. Four test assessment methods (Beighton Score [BS], Carter and Wilkinson, Hospital del Mar, Rotes‐Querol) and two questionnaire assessment methods (Five‐part questionnaire [5PQ], Beighton Score‐self reported [BS‐self]) were identified on children or adults. Using the Consensus‐based Standards for selection of health Measurement Instrument (COSMIN) checklist for evaluating the methodological quality of the identified studies, all included studies were rated “fair” or “poor.” Most studies were using BS, and for BS the reliability most of the studies showed limited positive to conflicting evidence, with some shortcomings on studies for the validity. The three other test assessment methods lack satisfactory information on both reliability and validity. For the questionnaire assessment methods, 5PQ was the most frequently used, and reliability showed conflicting evidence, while the validity had limited positive to conflicting evidence compared with test assessment methods. For BS‐self, the validity showed unknown evidence compared with test assessment methods. In conclusion, following recommended uniformity of testing procedures, the recommendation for clinical use in adults is BS with cut‐point of 5 of 9 including historical information, while in children it is BS with cut‐point of at least 6 of 9. However, more studies are needed to conclude on the validity properties of these assessment methods, and before evidence‐based recommendations can be made for clinical use on the “best” assessment method for classifying GJH. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine aims to approach disease treatment and prevention with consideration of the variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person. This focus on the individual is also key to the practice of genetic counseling, whereby foundational professional values prioritize informed and autonomous patient decisions regarding their genetic health. Genetic counselors are ideally suited to help realize the goals of the precision medicine. However, a limited genetic counseling workforce at a time in which there is a rapidly growing need for services is challenging the balance of supply and demand. This article provides historical context to better understand what has informed traditional models of genetic counseling and considers some of the current forces that require genetic counselors to adapt their practice. New service delivery models can improve access to genetic healthcare by overcoming geographical barriers, allowing genetic counselors to see a higher volume of patients and supporting other healthcare providers to better provide genetic services to meet the needs of their patients. Approaches to genetic counseling service delivery are considered with a forward focus to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for genetic counselors in this age of precision health.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain in the Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) is common and may be severe. According to one study, nearly 90% of patients report some form of chronic pain. Pain, which is often one of the first symptoms to occur, may be widespread or localized to one region such as an arm or a leg. Studies on treatment modalities are few and insufficient to guide management. The following is a discussion of the evidence regarding the underlying mechanisms of pain in EDS. The causes of pain in this condition are multifactorial and include joint subluxations and dislocations, previous surgery, muscle weakness, proprioceptive disorders, and vertebral instability. Affected persons may also present with generalized body pain, fatigue, headaches, gastrointestinal pain, temporomandibular joint pain, dysmenorrhea, and vulvodynia. Pain management strategies may be focused around treating the cause of the pain (e.g., dislocation of a joint, proprioceptive disorder) and minimizing the sensation of pain. Management strategies for chronic pain in EDS includes physical therapy, medications, as well as durable medical equipment such as cushions, compressive garments, and braces. The different modalities are discussed in this paper. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Joubert syndrome (JS) is a genetically heterogeneous primary ciliopathy characterized by a pathognomonic cerebellar and brainstem malformation, the \"molar tooth sign,\" and variable organ involvement. Over 40 causative genes have been identified to date, explaining up to 94% of cases. To date, gene-phenotype correlates have been delineated only for a handful of genes, directly translating into improved counseling and clinical care. For instance, JS individuals harboring pathogenic variants in TMEM67 have a significantly higher risk of liver fibrosis, while pathogenic variants in NPHP1, RPGRIP1L, and TMEM237 are frequently associated to JS with renal involvement, requiring a closer monitoring of liver parameters, or renal functioning. On the other hand, individuals with causal variants in the CEP290 or AHI1 need a closer surveillance for retinal dystrophy and, in case of CEP290, also for chronic kidney disease. These examples highlight how an accurate description of the range of clinical symptoms associated with defects in each causative gene, including the rare ones, would better address prognosis and help guiding a personalized management. This review proposes to address this issue by assessing the available literature, to confirm known, as well as to propose rare gene-phenotype correlates in JS.",

Accurate estimates of the cost of care for persons with FAS are essential for appropriate funding of health care, developmental disabilities services, special education, and other service systems, as well as prioritizing funding of public health prevention efforts. The cost of care for individuals with FAS can be conceptualized as the annual cost of care for one person or a population, or as the lifetime cost of care for an individual. Annual cost estimates for the United States range from $75 million in 1984 to $4.0 billion in 1998. Estimates of lifetime cost vary from $596,000 in 1980 to $1.4 million in 1988. After adjustments for changes in inflation and population, 2002 estimates of total annual cost and lifetime cost are higher. FAS is increasingly being recognized as a large public health problem with high potential for the prevention of future cases and for the prevention of excess disability and premature mortality in persons who are affected. Each day, from 6–22 infants with FAS are born in the United States, and as many as 87–103 more are born with other impairments resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure.

We present detailed clinical, neuroradiologic, molecular, biochemical, and functional data on 77 patients with GA1 representative of a 14-year clinical experience. Microencephalic macrocephaly at birth is the earliest sign of GA1 and is associated with stretched bridging veins that can be a cause of subdural hematoma and acute retinal hemorrhage. Acute striatal necrosis during infancy is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality and leads to chronic oromotor, gastroesophageal, skeletal, and respiratory complications of dystonia. Injury to the putamen is heralded by abrupt-onset behavioral arrest. Tissue degeneration is stroke-like in pace, radiologic appearance, and irreversibility. It is uniformly symmetric, regionally selective, confined to children under 18 months of age, and occurs almost always during an infectious illness. Our knowledge of disease mechanisms, though incomplete, is sufficient to allow a rational approach to management of encephalopathic crises. Screening of asymptomatic newborns with GA1 followed by thoughtful prospective care reduces the incidence of radiologically and clinically evident basal ganglia injury from approximately 90% to 35%. Uninjured children have good developmental outcomes and thrive within Amish and non-Amish communities.",

    "abstract": "The epidemiological investigation of the common open neural tube defects (NTDs), anencephaly, and spina bifida, has a long history. The most significant finding from these past studies of NTDs was the identification of the protective effect of maternal, periconceptional supplementation with folic acid. Fortuitously, the association between folic acid and NTDs became widely accepted in the early 1990s, at a time when genetic association studies of complex traits were becoming increasingly feasible. The confluence of these events has had a major impact on the direction of epidemiological, NTD research. Association studies to evaluate genes that may influence the risk of NTDs through their role in folate-related processes, or through other metabolic or developmental pathways are now commonplace. Moreover, the study of genetic as well as non-genetic, factors that may influence NTD risk through effects on the nutrient status of the mother or embryo has emerged as a major research focus. Research efforts over the past decade indicate that gene-gene, gene-environment, and higher-order interactions, as well as maternal genetic effects influence NTD risk, highlighting the complexity of the factors that underlie these conditions. The challenge for the future is to design studies that address these complexities, and are adequately powered to detect the factors or combination of factors that influence the development of NTDs.",

In Perlman syndrome, only Wilms tumor has been recorded, whereas in Sotos syndrome, lympho-hematologic tumors are most frequent. Based on literature review, a specific schedule protocol for tumor screening is suggested for each OGS.

    "abstract": "Abstract Methylmalonic and propionic aciduria (PA) are the most frequent forms of branched‐chain organic acidurias. These autosomal recessive disorders result from deficient activity of methylmalonyl‐CoA mutase and propionyl‐CoA carboxylase, respectively. Clinically, acute or chronic neurologic signs are caused by the accumulation of toxic compounds proximal to the metabolic block. Phenotype varies from severe neonatal‐onset forms with high mortality and poor outcome to milder forms with a later onset. In both cases the clinical course is dominated by the risk of relapses of life‐threatening episodes of metabolic decompensation and of severe organ failure. Despite improvement of treatment, the overall outcome remains disappointing with no major differences between the two diseases. The diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic compounds in body fluids as detected by organic acid analysis in urine and acylcarnitine profile in blood. Therapy is based on low‐protein high‐energy diet, carnitine supplementation, and metronidazole. Some patients with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) respond to pharmacological doses of vitamin B12. Given the poor long‐term prognosis, liver transplantation has been recently attempted as an alternative therapy to conventional medical treatment to cure the underlying metabolic defect. Nevertheless, the overall experience to date does not clearly demonstrate its effectiveness in preventing further deterioration or improving survival and quality of life. The recent implementation of neonatal screening by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry has decreased early mortality and improved the short‐term outcome, without changing the detection rate of both diseases in the screening population compared to clinically detected cases. However, the limited number of patients and the short duration of their follow‐up do not yet permit drawing final conclusions on its effect on the long‐term outcome of methylmalonic and propionic acidemia. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The complex hindbrain malformation that is characteristic of JBTS can be identified on axial magnetic resonance imaging and is known as the molar tooth sign (MTS); other diagnostic criteria include intellectual disability, hypotonia, and often, abnormal respiratory pattern and/or abnormal eye movements. In addition, a broad spectrum of other anomalies characterize Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD), and may include retinal dystrophy, ocular coloboma, oral frenulae and tongue tumors, polydactyly, cystic renal disease (including cystic dysplasia or juvenile nephronophthisis), and congenital hepatic fibrosis. The clinical course can be variable, but most children with this condition survive infancy to reach adulthood. At least eight genes cause JSRD, with some genotype–phenotype correlations emerging, including the association between mutations in the MKS3 gene and hepatic fibrosis characteristic of the JSRD subtype known as COACH syndrome. Several of the causative genes for JSRD are implicated in other ciliary disorders, such as juvenile nephronophthisis and Meckel syndrome, illustrating the close association between these conditions and their overlapping clinical features that reflect a shared etiology involving the primary cilium. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Randomized trials, supported by many observational studies, have shown that periconceptional use of folic acid, alone or in multivitamin supplements, is effective for the primary prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs). Whether this is true also for other congenital anomalies is a complex issue and the focus of this review. It is useful to consider the evidence not only for specific birth defects separately but, importantly, also for all birth defects combined. For the latter, the Hungarian randomized clinical trial indicated, for periconceptional multivitamin use, a reduction in the risk for all birth defects (odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.35–0.70), even after excluding NTDs (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.38–0.75). The Atlanta population‐based case‐control study, the only large observational study to date on all major birth defects, also found a significant risk reduction for all birth defects (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.69–0.93) even after excluding NTDs (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72–0.97). These and other studies also evaluated specific anomalies, including those of the heart, limb, and urinary tract, as well as orofacial clefts, omphalocele, and imperforate anus. For cardiovascular anomalies, two studies were negative, whereas three, including the randomized clinical trial, suggest a possible 25–50% overall risk reduction, more marked for some conotruncal and septal defects. For orofacial clefts, six of seven case‐control studies suggest an apparent reduced risk, which could vary by cleft type and perhaps, according to some investigators, by pill dosage. For limb deficiencies, three case‐control studies and the randomized trial estimated approximately a 50% reduced risk. For urinary tract defects, three case‐control studies and the randomized trial reported reduced risks, as did one study of nonsyndromic omphalocele. All these studies examined multivitamin supplement use. With respect to folic acid alone, a reduced rate of imperforate anus was observed among folic acid users in China. We discuss key gaps in knowledge, possible avenues for future research, and counseling issues for families concerned about occurrence or recurrence of these birth defects. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cilia function is critical to the development of proper organ laterality. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) causes randomization of situs. Heterotaxy, or situs ambiguus, is an abnormal arrangement of the thoracic and abdominal organs that results in congenital anomalies. Animal models and developmental biological approaches have defined pathways required during embryogenesis for proper left–right pattern formation. New candidates for genetic causes of human laterality disorders have emerged from recent studies on the assembly, transport, and signaling functions of cilia at the node as well as identification of cilia within the developing heart. There is evidence that deleterious genetic variants within one or more developmental pathways may disrupt signaling in a synergistic or combinatorial fashion to cause congenital anomalies. The molecular pathways underlying PCD and heterotaxy are being discovered at a rapid pace, and there is increasing recognition of the overlap between these two categories of laterality disorders and their relationship to isolated cardiovascular malformations. This review focuses on the clinical manifestations, molecular mechanisms, and human genetics of these disorders of laterality. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases (HRFCDs) are among the most common inherited human disorders. The discovery that proteins defective in the autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney diseases (ADPKD and ARPKD) localize to the primary cilia and the recognition of the role these organelles play in the pathogenesis of HRFCDs led to the term “ciliopathies.” While ADPKD and ARPKD are the most common ciliopathies associated with both liver and kidney disease, variable degrees of renal and/or hepatic involvement occur in many other ciliopathies, including Joubert, Bardet–Biedl, Meckel–Gruber, and oral–facial–digital syndromes. The ductal plate malformation (DPM), a developmental abnormality of the portobiliary system, is the basis of the liver disease in ciliopathies that manifest congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF), Caroli syndrome (CS), and polycystic liver disease (PLD). Hepatocellular function remains relatively preserved in ciliopathy‐associated liver diseases. The major morbidity associated with CHF is portal hypertension (PH), often leading to esophageal varices and hypersplenism. In addition, CD predisposes to recurrent cholangitis. PLD is not typically associated with PH, but may result in complications due to mass effects. The kidney pathology in ciliopathies ranges from non‐functional cystic dysplastic kidneys to an isolated urinary concentration defect; the disorders contributing to this pathology, in addition to ADPKD and ARPKD, include nephronophithisis (NPHP), glomerulocystic kidney disease and medullary sponge kidneys. Decreased urinary concentration ability, resulting in polyuria and polydypsia, is the first and most common renal symptom in ciliopathies. While the majority of ADPKD, ARPKD, and NPHP patients require renal transplantation, the frequency and rate of progression to renal failure varies considerably in other ciliopathies. This review focuses on the kidney and liver disease found in the different ciliopathies. Published 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

These descriptions are often paradoxical in nature with individuals with WS repeatedly described as demonstrating near‐normal language despite the presence of significant intellectual disability and as being extremely sociable and friendly in spite of their seemingly limited understanding of basic social norms. While this depiction of WS served to attract the interest of basic‐science researchers, the results of subsequent studies have provided a more nuanced view. For example, rather than across‐the‐board “near‐normal” language, children with WS demonstrate relative strengths in concrete vocabulary and verbal short‐term memory, grammatical abilities at the level expected for general intellectual ability, and considerable weakness in relational/conceptual language and pragmatics (social use of language). To provide a more thorough characterization of the WS behavioral phenotype, we summarize recent findings related to intellectual ability, language development, memory development, executive function development, adaptive behavior skills, and behavior as it relates to learning by children with WS. Finally, we briefly discuss intervention approaches that may help children with WS to achieve their full potential. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

In addition, many of these ENT problems require surgical interventions, and there are special anesthesia considerations that need to be addressed in children with DS. These include subglottic stenosis, post-operative airway obstruction, and cervical spine concerns. As the care of children with DS has become more consistent and proactive, outcomes from the treatment of these ENT manifestations have improved. Aggressive interventions, both medical and surgical, have led to a decreased incidence of hearing loss, good control of the chronic rhinitis, and a better awareness of the incidence of sleep apnea and sleep-disordered breathing in individuals with DS.

It was the first organic acidemia recognized in humans and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment with a protein restricted diet and supplementation with carnitine and glycine are effective in promoting normal development in severely affected individuals. Both intra‐ and interfamilial variability have been recognized. Initially, two phenotypes with either an acute neonatal or a chronic intermittent presentation were described. More recently, a third group of individuals with mild biochemical abnormalities who can be asymptomatic have been identified through newborn screening of blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry. IVD is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the conversion of isovaleryl‐CoA to 3‐methylcrotonyl‐CoA and transfers electrons to the electron transfer flavoprotein. Human IVD has been purified from tissue and recombinant sources and its biochemical and physical properties have been extensively studied. Molecular analysis of the IVD gene from patients with IVA has allowed characterization of different types of mutations in this gene. One missense mutation, 932C&gt;T (A282V), is particularly common in patients identified through newborn screening with mild metabolite elevations and who have remained asymptomatic to date. This mutation leads to a partially active enzyme with altered catalytic properties; however, its effects on clinical outcome and the necessity of therapy are still unknown. A better understanding of the heterogeneity of this disease and the relevance of genotype/phenotype correlations to clinical management of patients are among the challenges remaining in the study of this disorder in the coming years. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The spectrum of cancer susceptibility in this group of disorders has not been studied in detail. We identified more than 1900 cases of NS, CS, CFCS, or NSML reported in the literature between 1937 and 2010; 88 cancers were reported. The most common cancers reported in 1051 NS subjects were neuroblastoma (n = 8), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 8), low grade glioma (n = 6), and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 6). These associations are biologically plausible, given that somatic RAS pathway mutations are known to occur in these specific cancers. In addition, 40 childhood cases of myeloproliferative disease were described in individuals with NS, several of whom experienced a benign course of this hematologic condition. We confirmed the previously described association between CS and cancer in 268 reported individuals: 19 had rhabdomyosarcoma, 4 had bladder cancer, and 5 had neuroblastoma. By age 20, the cumulative incidence of cancer was approximately 4% for NS and 15% for CS; both syndromes had a cancer incidence peak in childhood. The cancers described in CFCS and NSML overlapped with those reported in NS and CS. Future epidemiologic studies will be required to confirm the described cancer spectrum and to estimate precise cancer risks.",

The purpose of the present study was to analyze diverse epidemiological aspects of CT, including the different variables listed in the Introduction Section of this issue of the Journal. The study was made possible using the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR) structure. This multicenter worldwide research includes the largest sample of CT ever studied. A total of 383 carefully reviewed sets of CT obtained from 26,138,837 births reported by 21 Clearinghouse Surveillance Programs (SP) were included in the analysis. Total prevalence was 1.47 per 100,000 births (95% CI: 1.32–1.62). Salient findings including an evident variation in prevalence among SPs: a marked variation in the type of pregnancy outcome, a similarity in the proportion of CT types among programs: a significant female predominance in CT: particularly of the thoracopagus type and a significant male predominance in parapagus and parasitic types: significant differences in prevalence by ethnicity and an apparent increasing prevalence trend in South American countries.

    "abstract": "Abstract Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a systemic disorder of the connective tissue that is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and which displays variable manifestations in the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. These pleiotropic manifestations are accounted for by mutations in fibrillin‐1, the building block of extracellular microfibrils. During the past 10 years, we have witnessed significant progress in delineating the pathological events responsible for the manifestations of MFS. Much of this progress has been based on the creation and analysis of fibrillin‐1 mutant mouse lines that faithfully recapitulate the spectrum of clinical severity of MFS. These studies have established the critical contribution of fibrillin‐1 deficiency to disease progression through altered cell–matrix interactions and dysregulated TGF‐β signaling. As a result, our definition of MFS as the prototypical structural disorder of the connective tissue has changed to that of a developmental abnormality with broad and complex effects on the morphogenesis and function of multiple organ systems. Importantly, new biological targets have emerged that may yield exciting new opportunities for the development of productive treatment strategies in MFS. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare congenital anomaly syndrome. Although it may be classified as an “overgrowth” syndrome due to slightly increased birth weight and relative macrocephaly, it is characterized by severe postnatal failure to thrive and short stature. Patients with CS have an increased risk for malignant tumors, a hallmark of several model overgrowth syndromes. The most common tumor in CS is rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), followed by neuroblastoma and bladder carcinoma. The occurrence of bladder carcinoma in adolescents is distinctly unusual as this is typically a neoplasm of older adults and is not seen with increased frequency in other tumor predisposition syndromes. The increased tumor frequency in CS led to the proposal of a screening protocol, consisting of abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds, and urine studies for catecholamine metabolites and hematuria. It has since become apparent that patients with CS have an increased excretion of catecholamine metabolites in urine without the presence of an identifiable catecholamine secreting tumor. Thus, the urine assay for catecholamines is unhelpful as a screening test for neuroblastoma and should not be used in this population. The benefit of abdominal and pelvic ultrasound and urinalysis for hematuria as screening tests remains to be shown. A timely diagnosis of CS is a necessary prerequisite for awareness of the increased tumor risk. Once a malignancy has been identified, treatment should follow standard protocols. Additional medical problems characteristic for CS, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, need to be considered and addressed appropriately. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The anxiety disorders, individually and as a group, exhibit remarkably high rates of comorbidity with each other and with major depression. Analyses done in large-scale epidemiologic surveys have identified major patterns of phenomenological overlap between these conditions. Researchers have tested hypotheses of shared genetic etiologies as a potential basis of this relationship. In general, available family studies have found mixed evidence for co-aggregation of anxiety and depressive disorders, while twin studies more definitively indicate that shared genetic risk factors largely account for this comorbidity. Some of this appears to be accounted for by genetic variation in personality traits that broadly predispose to anxiety and depression. Molecular genetic studies of these conditions, though too early to draw firm conclusions, thus far provide tentative support for specific genetic loci that may generally influence susceptibility across the anxiety-depressive spectrum.",

The syndrome is also characterized by several distinct dysmorphic features, including large anterior fontanels, microcephaly, brachycephaly, deep-set eyes, flat nose and nasal bridge, and pointed chin. Several genes have been proposed as causative for individual features of the phenotype. In addition, based upon molecular characterization of subjects with monosomy 1p36, several mechanisms for the generation and stabilization of terminal deletions have been proposed.",

Adenosylcobalamin is required for activity of mitochondrial methylmalonylCoA mutase and methylcobalamin is required for activity of cytoplasmic methionine synthase. Deficiency in cobalamin, or inability to absorb cobalamin normally, can result in accumulation of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine in blood and urine. Methylmalonic acidemia can result in metabolic acidosis which in severe cases may be fatal. Hyperhomocysteinemia along with hypomethioninemia can result in hematologic (megaloblastic anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and neurologic (subacute combined degeneration of the cord, dementia, psychosis) defects. Inborn errors affecting cobalamin absorption (inherited intrinsic factor deficiency, Imerslund–Gra¨ sbeck syndrome) and transport (transcobalamin deficiency) have been described. A series of inborn errors of intracellular cobalamin metabolism, designated cblA-cblG, have been differentiated by complementation analysis. These can give rise to isolated methylmalonic acidemia (cblA, cblB, cblD variant 2), isolated hyperhomocysteinemia (cblD variant 1, cblE, cblG) or combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia (cblC, classic cblD, cblF). All these disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. The genes underlying each of these disorders have been identified. Two other disorders, haptocorrin deficiency and transcobalamin receptor deficiency, have been described, but it is not clear that they have any consistent clinical phenotype.",

We present the results of array CGH in 8,789 clinical cases submitted for a variety of developmental problems.

    "abstract": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a congenital multiple anomaly/intellectual disability syndrome caused by a deficiency of cholesterol synthesis resulting from a deficiency of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) reductase encoded by DHCR7. SLOS is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, a variable degree of intellectual disability that encompasses normal intelligence to severe intellectual deficiency, and multiple major and minor malformations. External malformations include distinctive facial features, cleft palate, postaxial polydactyly, 2-3 syndactyly of the toes, and underdeveloped external genitalia in males, while internal anomalies may affect every organ system. The clinical spectrum is wide, and rare individuals have been described with normal development and only minor malformations. The clinical diagnosis of SLOS is confirmed by demonstrating an abnormally elevated concentration of the cholesterol precursor, 7DHC, in serum or other tissues, or by the presence of two DHCR7 mutations. The enzymatic deficiency results in decreased cholesterol and increased 7DHC levels, both during embryonic development and after birth. The malformations found in SLOS may result from decreased cholesterol, increased 7DHC or a combination of these two factors. This review discusses the physical and behavioral phenotype of SLOS, the diagnostic approaches, the natural history from the prenatal period to adulthood, and current understanding of the pathophysiology of SLOS.",

The most severe form of tyrosinemia, Type I, is a devastating disorder of childhood that causes liver failure, painful neurologic crises, rickets, and hepatocarcinoma. This disorder is caused by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). If untreated, death typically occurs at less than 2 years of age, with some chronic forms allowing longer survival. It has a prevalence of about 1 in 100,000 newborns in the general population. Oculocutaneous tyrosinemia, Type II, is caused by a deficiency of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT). It clinically presents with hyperkeratotic plaques on the hands and soles of the feet and photophobia due to deposition of tyrosine crystals within the cornea. Tyrosinemia Type III is an extremely rare disorder caused by a deficiency of 4‐hydroxyphenylpyruvic dioxygenase. It has been associated with ataxia and mild mental retardation. These disorders are diagnosed by observing elevated tyrosine by plasma amino acid chromatography and characteristic tyrosine metabolites by urine organic acid analysis. In tyrosinemia Type I, methionine is also elevated, reflecting impaired hepatocellular function. Urine organic acids show elevated p‐hydroxy‐phenyl organic acids in each type of tyrosinemia, and the pathognomic succinylacetone in tyrosinemia Type I. Diagnosis can be confirmed by enzyme or molecular studies in tyrosinemia Type I. Therapy consists of a diet low in phenylalanine and tyrosine for each of the tyrosinemias and 2‐(2‐nitro‐4‐trifluoromethylbenzoyl)‐1,3‐cyclohexanedione (NTBC) for tyrosinemia Type I. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a well‐known multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome, firstly described in 1961 by Cooper and Hirschhorn. Its frequency is estimated as 1/50,000–1/20,000 births, with a female predilection of 2:1. The disorder is caused by partial loss of material from the distal portion of the short arm of chromosome 4 (4p16.3), and is considered a contiguous gene syndrome. No single gene deletions or intragenic mutations have been shown to confer the full WHS phenotype. Since the disorder was brought to the attention of geneticists, many additional cases have been published. Only in 1999, however, were the first data on the natural history brought to the attention of the medical community. The purpose of the present study is to help delineate in more detail and over a longer period of time, the natural history of WHS, in order to establish appropriate health supervision and anticipatory guidance for individuals with this disorder. We have collected information on 87 patients diagnosed with WHS (54 females and 33 males) both in USA and Italy. Age at first observation ranged between newborn and 17 years. Twenty patients have been followed from 4 months to 23 years. The deletion proximal breakpoint varied from 4p15.32 to 4p16.3, and, by FISH, was terminal and included both WHSCR. Deletion was detected by standard cytogenetics in 44/87 (50.5%) patients, whereas FISH was necessary in the other 43 (49.5%). Array‐CGH analysis at 1 Mb resolution was performed in 34/87 patients, and, in 15/34 (44%), showed an unbalanced translocation leading to both a 4p monosomy and a partial trisomy for another chromosome arm. Six more patients had been previously shown to have an unbalanced translocation by karyotype analysis or FISH with a WHS‐specific probe. Sixty‐five of 87 patients had an apparent pure, de novo, terminal deletion; and 1/87 a tandem duplication of 4p16.1p16.3 associated with 4p16.3pter deletion. Age at diagnosis varied between 7 months gestation and 16 years. Ninety‐three percent had a seizure disorder with a good outcome; 80% had prenatal onset growth deficiency followed by short stature and slow weight gain; 60% had skeletal anomalies; 50% had heart lesions; 50% had abnormal tooth development; and 40% had hearing loss. Distinctive EEG findings were seen in 90%. Structural CNS anomalies were detected in 80%. Global developmental delay of varying degrees was present in all patients. Almost 50% was able to walk either alone or with support. Hypotonia was present in virtually all patients. A global improvement was observed in all individuals, over time. Our survey has also shown how the characteristic facial phenotype tends to be less pronounced in those patients with a smaller deletion, and microcephaly is not observed in the patients with certain cryptic unbalanced translocations. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The University of Florida (UF) Health Personalized Medicine Program (PMP) is a pharmacist‐led, multidisciplinary initiative created in 2011 within the UF Clinical Translational Science Institute. Initial efforts focused on pharmacogenetics, with long‐term goals to include expansion to disease‐risk prediction and disease stratification. Herein we describe the processes for development of the program, the challenges that were encountered and the clinical acceptance by clinicians of the genomic medicine implementation. The initial clinical implementation of the UF PMP began in June 2012 and targeted clopidogrel use and the CYP2C19 genotype in patients undergoing left heart catheterization and percutaneous‐coronary intervention (PCI). After 1 year, 1,097 patients undergoing left heart catheterization were genotyped preemptively, and 291 of those underwent subsequent PCI. Genotype results were reported to the medical record for 100% of genotyped patients. Eighty patients who underwent PCI had an actionable genotype, with drug therapy changes implemented in 56 individuals. Average turnaround time from blood draw to genotype result entry in the medical record was 3.5 business days. Seven different third party payors, including Medicare, reimbursed for the test during the first month of billing, with an 85% reimbursement rate for outpatient claims that were submitted in the first month. These data highlight multiple levels of success in clinical implementation of genomic medicine. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Gastroschisis offers the intriguing epidemiological situation of a pandemic, strongly associated with very low maternal age. Identifying gastroschisis, and distinguishing it from the other abdominal wall defects, is theoretically easy but difficult in practice. The baseline birth prevalence of gastroschisis before the pandemic was approximately 1 in 50,000 births and has increased since between 10‐ and 20‐fold. In many populations worldwide, it is still increasing. Such increasing prevalence and the association with very low maternal age are well proven, but the interaction between these two findings remains unknown. Geographic gradients (decreasing prevalence from North to South) are clear in Continental Europe and suggestive in Britain and Ireland. Gastroschisis seems more frequent in Caucasians compared to African Blacks and Orientals, and in Northern compared to Southern Europeans. These observations indicate the need for investigating gene–environment interactions. Since the global human situation is marked by inequalities among as well as within countries, the medical care and public health impact of gastroschisis varies widely among regions and social strata. The postnatal benefits of prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis include family awareness; adequate planning of delivery with alerted obstetrical, pediatric, and surgical staff; optimal risk categorization, and personalized protocol for action. The increasing prevalence of gastroschisis combined with improved medical techniques to reduce morbidity and mortality are also increasing the burden and costs of this anomaly on health systems. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Reliance on cross‐sectional behavioral data in samples that span wide age ranges may have limited this endeavor because ASD behaviors are not static within individuals across development. This study uses quantitative methods to describe specific aspects of changes in autism‐related and more general behaviors in order to yield trajectories that could be used in place of single time‐point data as behavioral phenotypes in neurobiological studies of both Autism Spectrum Disorders and overlapping conditions. Building on previous analyses, we examined trajectories of parent‐reported social‐communication deficits, social adaptive functioning, and two types of repetitive behaviors, repetitive sensory motor (RSM) behaviors and insistence on sameness (IS) behaviors, in a relatively large sample of participants referred for possible autism at age 2 years and followed into young adulthood (n = 85). A strength of this sample was the diverse range of outcomes, including young adults with intellectual disability and persistent autism related difficulties, those with IQs in the borderline or average range who continued to experience functional impairment related to Autism Spectrum Disorders, and a small group of young adults (n = 8) with IQs in the average range who were judged to be functioning socially and adaptively at age‐appropriate levels at age 19 years, despite a previous childhood diagnosis of autism.",

The mean age was 17 years. Although most patients remain small, obesity may develop. Gastroesophageal reflux persists or worsens, and there are early long-term sequelae, including Barrett esophagus in 10%; other gastrointestinal findings include risk for volvulus, rumination, and chronic constipation. Submucous cleft palate was found in 14%, most undetected before our evaluation. Chronic sinusitis was noted in 39%, often with nasal polyps. Blepharitis improves with age; cataracts and detached retina may occur. Decreased bone density is observed, with occasional fractures. One quarter have leg length discrepancy and 39% scoliosis. Most females have delayed or irregular menses but normal gynecologic exams and pap smears. Benign prostatic hypertrophy occurred in one male prior to 40 years. The phenotype is variable, but there is a distinct pattern of facial changes with aging. Premature gray hair is frequent; two patients had cutis verticis gyrata. Behavioral issues and specific psychiatric diagnoses, including self-injury, anxiety, attention-deficit disorder, autistic features, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior, often worsen with age. This work presents some evidence for accelerated aging in CdLS. Of 53% with mutation analysis, 55% demonstrate a detectable mutation in NIPBL or SMC1A. Although no specific genotype-phenotype correlations have been firmly established, individuals with missense mutations in NIPBL and SMC1A appear milder than those with other mutations. Based on these observations, recommendations for clinical management of adults with CdLS are made.",

    "abstract": "This review covers briefly the major conditions, genetic and non-genetic, sometimes leading to abnormally elevated methionine, with emphasis on recent developments. A major aim is to assist in the differential diagnosis of hypermethioninemia. The genetic conditions are: (1) Homocystinuria due to cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency. At least 150 different mutations in the CBS gene have been identified since this deficiency was established in 1964. Hypermethioninemia is due chiefly to remethylation of the accumulated homocysteine. (2) Deficient activity of methionine adenosyltransferases I and III (MAT I/III), the isoenzymes the catalytic subunit of which are encoded by MAT1A. Methionine accumulates because its conversion to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is impaired. (3) Glycine N-methyltrasferase (GNMT) deficiency. Disruption of a quantitatively major pathway for AdoMet disposal leads to AdoMet accumulation with secondary down-regulation of methionine flux into AdoMet. (4) S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase (AHCY) deficiency. Not being catabolized normally, AdoHcy accumulates and inhibits many AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, producing accumulation of AdoMet and, thereby, hypermethioninemia. (5) Citrin deficiency, found chiefly in Asian countries. Lack of this mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate transporter may produce (usually transient) hypermethioninemia, the immediate cause of which remains uncertain. (6) Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) deficiency (tyrosinemia type I) may lead to hypermethioninemia secondary either to liver damage and/or to accumulation of fumarylacetoacetate, an inhibitor of the high K(m) MAT. Additional possible genetic causes of hypermethioninemia accompanied by elevations of plasma AdoMet include mitochondrial disorders (the specificity and frequency of which remain to be elucidated). Non-genetic conditions include: (a) Liver disease, which may cause hypermethioninemia, mild, or severe. (b) Low-birth-weight and/or prematurity which may cause transient hypermethioninemia. (c) Ingestion of relatively large amounts of methionine which, even in full-term, normal-birth-weight babies may cause hypermethioninemia.",

This can involve the entire chromosome or only a small segment. As a consequence of UPD, or uniparental duplication/deficiency of part of a chromosome, there are two types of developmental risk: aberrant dosage of genes regulated by genomic imprinting and homozygosity of a recessive mutation. UPD models generated by reciprocal and Robertsonian translocation heterozygote intercrosses have been a powerful tool to investigate genomic imprinting in mice, whereas novel UPD patients such as those with cystic fibrosis and Prader–Willi syndrome, triggered the clarification of recessive diseases and genomic imprinting disorders in human. Newly developed genomic technologies as well as conventional microsatellite marker methods have been contributing to the functional and mechanistic investigation of UPD, leading to not only the acquisition of clinically valuable information, but also the further clarification of diverse genetic processes and disease pathogenesis. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety disorders are a highly prevalent and disabling class of psychiatric disorders. This review focuses on new directions in neurobiological research and implications for the development of novel psychopharmacological treatments. Neuroanatomical and neuroimaging research in anxiety disorders has centered on the role of the amygdala, reciprocal connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, and, most recently, alterations in interoceptive processing by the anterior insula. Anxiety disorders are characterized by alterations in a diverse range of neurochemical systems, suggesting ample novel targets for drug therapies. Corticotropin‐releasing factor (CRF) concentrations are elevated in a subset of anxiety disorders, which suggests the potential utility of CRF receptor antagonists. Pharmacological blockade of the memory‐enhancing effects of stress hormones such as glucocorticoids and noradrenaline holds promise as a preventative approach for trauma‐related anxiety. The glutamatergic system has been largely overlooked as a potential pharmacological target, although convergent preclinical, neuroimaging, and early clinical findings suggest that glutamate receptor antagonists may have potent anxiolytic effects. Glutamatergic receptor agonists (e.g., D ‐cycloserine) also have an emerging role in the treatment of anxiety as facilitators of fear extinction during concurrent behavioral interventions. The neuropeptides substance P, neuropeptide Y, oxytocin, orexin, and galanin are each implicated in anxiety pathways, and neuropeptide analogs or antagonists show early promise as anxiolytics in preclinical and/or clinical research. Each of these active areas of research holds promise for expanding and improving evidence‐based treatment options for individuals suffering with clinical anxiety. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) and megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) syndromes are highly recognizable and partly overlapping disorders of brain overgrowth (megalencephaly). Both syndromes are characterized by congenital or early postnatal megalencephaly, with a high risk for progressive ventriculomegaly leading to hydrocephalus and cerebellar tonsillar ectopia leading to Chiari malformation, and cortical brain abnormalities, specifically polymicrogyria. MCAP is further characterized by distinct cutaneous capillary malformations, finger or toe syndactyly, postaxial polydactyly, variable connective tissue dysplasia and mild focal or segmental body overgrowth, among other features. MPPH, on the other hand, lacks consistent vascular or somatic manifestations besides postaxial polydactyly in almost half of reported individuals. We identified de novo germline mutations in PIK3R2 and AKT3 in individuals with MPPH, and both postzygotic, mosaic and rare germline mutations in PIK3CA in individuals with MCAP. PIK3R2, AKT3, and PIK3CA are members of the critical phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-vakt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) pathway that is well implicated in cell growth, proliferation, survival, apoptosis, among other diverse cellular functions. The identified mutations in these three genes have been shown to lead to gain of function and activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Germline and postzygotic mutations of PIK3CA and other PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway genes have also been identified in several other overgrowth syndromes, highlighting the key role of this signaling pathway in normal development and pathophysiology of a large group of congenital anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Classical EDS is a heritable disorder of connective tissue. Patients are affected with joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibilty, and skin fragility leading to atrophic scarring and significant bruising. These clinical features suggest consideration of the diagnosis which then needs to be confirmed, preferably by genetic testing. The most recent criteria for the diagnosis of EDS were devised in Villefranche in 1997. [Beighton et al. (1998); Am J Med Genet 77:31‐37]. The aims set out in the Villefranche Criteria were: to enable diagnostic uniformity for clinical and research purposes, to understand the natural history of each subtype of EDS, to inform management and genetic counselling, and to identify potential areas of research. The authors recognized that the criteria would need updating, but viewed the Villefranche nosology as a good starting point. Since 1997, there have been major advances in the molecular understanding of classical EDS. Previous question marks over genetic heterogeneity have been largely surpassed by evidence that abnormalities in type V collagen are the cause. Advances in molecular testing have made it possible to identify the causative mutation in the majority of patients. This has aided the further clarification of this diagnosis. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the current knowledge and highlight areas for future research. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Most children with Down syndrome (DS) do not have a psychiatric or neurobehavioral disorder. Current prevalence estimates of neurobehavioral and psychiatric co-morbidity in children with DS range from 18% to 38%. We have found it useful to distinguish conditions with a pre-pubertal onset from those presenting in the post-pubertal period, as these are biologically distinct periods each with a unique vulnerability to specific psychiatric disorders. Due to the increased recognition that psychiatric symptoms may co-occur with mental retardation, and are not inextricably linked to cognitive impairment, these conditions are considered treatable, in part, under a medical model. Improvement in physiologic regulation, emotional stability, and neurocognitive processing is one of the most elusive but fundamental goals of pharmacologic intervention in these disorders.",

In some, the profession has been in existence for decades and is increasingly recognized as an important provider of allied health, while in others it is just beginning. In this article, we describe the current global landscape of the genetic counseling specialty field's professional development. Using examples of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and various countries in Asia, we highlight the following: (a) status of genetic counseling training programs, (b) availability of credentialing through government and professional bodies (certification, registration, and licensure), and potential for international reciprocity, (c) scope of clinical practice, and (d) health‐care system disparities and cultural differences impacting on practice. The successful global implementation of precision medicine will require both an increased awareness of the importance of the profession of “genetic counselor” and flexibility in how genetic counselors are incorporated into each country's health‐care market. In turn, this will require more collaboration within and across nations, along with continuing engagement of existing genetic counseling professional societies.",

    "abstract": "Based on genotype-phenotype correlation analysis of 80 Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) patients, as well as on review of relevant literature, we add further insights to the following aspects of WHS: (1) clinical delineation and phenotypic categories; (2) characterization of the basic genomic defect, mechanisms of origin and familiarity; (3) identification of prognostic factors for mental retardation; (4) chromosome mapping of the distinctive clinical signs, in an effort to identify pathogenic genes. Clinically, we consider that minimal diagnostic criteria for WHS, defining a \"core\" phenotype, are typical facial appearance, mental retardation, growth delay and seizures (or EEG anomalies). Three different categories of the WHS phenotype were defined, generally correlating with the extent of the 4p deletion. The first one comprises a small deletion not exceeding 3.5 Mb, that is usually associated with a mild phenotype, lacking major malformations. This category is likely under-diagnosed. The second and by far the more frequent category is identified by large deletions, averaging between 5 and 18 Mb, and causes the widely recognizable WHS phenotype. The third clinical category results from a very large deletion exceeding 22-25 Mb causing a severe phenotype, that can hardly be defined as typical WHS. Genetically, de novo chromosome abnormalities in WHS include pure deletions but also complex rearrangements, mainly unbalanced translocations. With the exception of t(4p;8p), WHS-associated chromosome abnormalities are neither mediated by segmental duplications, nor associated with a parental inversion polymorphism on 4p16.3. Factors involved in prediction of prognosis include the extent of the deletion, the occurrence of complex chromosome anomalies, and the severity of seizures. We found that the core phenotype maps within the terminal 1.9 Mb region of chromosome 4p. Therefore, WHSCR-2 should be considered the critical region for this condition. We also confirmed that the pathogenesis of WHS is multigenic. Specific and independent chromosome regions were characterized for growth delay and seizures, as well as for the additional clinical signs that characterize this condition. With the exception of parental balanced translocations, familial recurrence is uncommon.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Motile cilia have long been known to play a role in processes such as cell locomotion and fluid movement whereas the functions of primary cilia have remained obscure until recent years. To date, ciliary dysfunction has been shown to be causally linked to a number of clinical manifestations that characterize the group of human disorders known as ciliopathies. This classification reflects a common or shared cellular basis and implies that it is possible to associate a series of different human conditions with ciliary dysfunction, which allows gaining insight into the cellular defect in disorders of unknown etiology solely based on phenotypic observations. Furthermore, to date we know that the cilium participates in a number of biological processes ranging from chemo‐ and mechanosensation to the transduction of a growing list of paracrine signaling cascades that are critical for the development and maintenance of different tissues and organs. Consequently, the primary cilium has been identified as a key structure necessary to regulate and maintain cellular and tissue homeostasis and thus its study is providing significant information to understand the pathogenesis of the different phenotypes that characterize these human conditions. Finally, the similarities between different ciliopathies at the phenotypic level are proving to be due to their shared cellular defect and also their common genetic basis. To this end, recent studies are showing that mutations in a given ciliary gene often appear involved in the pathogenesis of more than one clinical entity, complicating their genetic dissection, and hindering our ability to generate accurate genotype–phenotype correlations. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Congenital heart diseases are some of the most common human birth defects. Though some congenital heart defects can be surgically corrected, treatment options for other congenital heart diseases are very limited. In many congenital heart diseases, genetic defects lead to impaired embryonic heart development or growth. One of the key development processes in cardiac development is chamber maturation, and alterations in this maturation process can manifest as a variety of congenital defects including non‐compaction, systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and arrhythmia. During development, to meet the increasing metabolic demands of the developing embryo, the myocardial wall undergoes extensive remodeling characterized by the formation of muscular luminal protrusions called cardiac trabeculae, increased cardiomyocyte mass, and development of the ventricular conduction system. Though the basic morphological and cytological changes involved in early heart development are clear, much remains unknown about the complex biomolecular mechanisms governing chamber maturation. In this review, we highlight evidence suggesting that a wide variety of basic signaling pathways and biomechanical forces are involved in cardiac wall maturation. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a complex congenital brain malformation characterized by failure of the forebrain to bifurcate into two hemispheres, a process normally completed by the fifth week of gestation. Modern high‐resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has allowed detailed analysis of the cortical, white matter, and deep gray structural anomalies in HPE in living humans. This has led to better classification of types of HPE, identification of newer subtypes, and understanding of the pathogenesis. Currently, there are four generally accepted subtypes of HPE: alobar, semilobar, lobar, and middle interhemispheric variant. These subtypes are defined primarily by the degree and region of neocortical nonseparation. Rather than there being four discrete subtypes of HPE, we believe that there is a continuum of midline neocortical nonseparation resulting in a spectrum disorder. Many patients with HPE fall within the border zone between the neighboring subtypes. In addition, there are patients with very mild HPE, where the nonseparation is restricted to the preoptic (suprachiasmic) area. In addition to the neocortex, other midline structures such as the thalami, hypothalamic nuclei, and basal ganglia are often nonseparated in HPE. The cortical and subcortical involvements in HPE are thought to occur due to a disruption in the ventral patterning process during development. The severity of the abnormalities in these structures determines the severity of the neurodevelopmental outcome and associated sequelae. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Within the multidisciplinary team, physical therapy plays a central role in management of individuals with hypermobility related disorders. However, many physical therapists are not familiar with the diagnostic criteria, prevalence, common clinical presentation, and management. This guideline aims to provide practitioners with the state of the art regarding the assessment and management of children, adolescents, and adults with JHS/hEDS. Due to the complexity of the symptoms in the profile of JHS/hEDS, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is adopted as a central framework whereby the umbrella term of disability is used to encompass functions, activities and participation, as well as environmental and personal factors. The current evidence-based literature regarding the management of JHS/hEDS is limited in size and quality and there is insufficient research exploring the clinical outcomes of a number of interventions. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions for children and adults. Until further multicenter trials are conducted, clinical decision-making should be based on theoretical and the current limited research evidence. For all individuals diagnosed with JHS/hEDS, international consensus and combined efforts to identify risk profiles would create a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms and the potential for optimizing health care for affected individuals.",

We review genotype‐phenotype correlation of all previously reported patients with mutations in SMARCB1 , SMARCA4 , SMARCE1 , and ARID1A through reassessment of their clinical and molecular findings. Cardinal features of CSS included variable degrees of intellectual disability (ID) predominantly affecting speech, sucking/feeding difficulty, and craniofacial (thick eyebrows, long eyelashes), digital (hypoplastic 5th fingers or toes, hypoplastic 5th fingernails or toenails), and other characteristics (hypertrichosis). In addition, patients with SMARCB1 mutations had severe neurodevelopmental deficits including severe ID, seizures, CNS structural abnormalities, and no expressive words as well as scoliosis. Especially, those with a recurrent mutation “p.Lys364del” represented strikingly similar phenotypes including characteristic facial coarseness. Patients with SMARCA4 mutations had less coarse craniofacial appearances and behavioral abnormalities. Patients with SMARCE1 mutations had a wide spectrum of manifestations from severe to moderate ID. Patients with ARID1A also had a wide spectrum of manifestations from severe ID and serous internal complications that could result in early death to mild ID. Mutations in SMARCB1 , SMARCA4 , and SMARCE1 are expected to exert dominant‐negative or gain‐of‐function effects, whereas those in ARID1A are expected to exert loss‐of‐function effects. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We have been able to establish a more complete picture of the WHS phenotype associated with distal 4p monosomy, and we are working to delineate the phenotypic effects when each gene on distal 4p is hemizygous. Our aim is to provide genotype‐specific anticipatory guidance and recommendations to families of individuals with a diagnosis of WHS. In addition, establishing the molecular underpinnings of the disorder will potentially suggest targets for molecular treatments. Thus, the next step is to determine the precise effects of specific gene deletions. As we look forward to deepening our understanding of distal 4p deletion, our focus will continue to be on the establishment of robust genotype‐phenotype correlations and the penetrance of these phenotypes. We will continue to follow our WHS cohort closely as they age to determine the presence or absence of some of these comorbidities, including hepatic neoplasms, hematopoietic dysfunction, and recurrence of seizures. We will also continue to refine the critical regions for other phenotypes as we enroll additional (hopefully informative) participants into the research study and as the mechanisms of the genes in these regions are elucidated.

Distinct BAF complex compositions are possible through combinatorial assembly of homologous subunit families and can serve non‐redundant functions. In mammalian neural development, developmental stage‐specific BAF assemblies are found in embryonic stem cells, neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons. In particular, the neural progenitor‐specific BAF complexes are essential for controlling the kinetics and mode of neural progenitor cell division, while neuronal BAF function is necessary for the maturation of postmitotic neuronal phenotypes as well as long‐term memory formation. The microRNA‐mediated mechanism for transitioning from npBAF to nBAF complexes is instructive for the neuronal fate and can even convert fibroblasts into neurons. The high frequency of BAF subunit mutations in neurological disorders underscores the rate‐determining role of BAF complexes in neural development, homeostasis, and plasticity. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Some of these mechanisms--ranging from heterokaryotypia to skewed X-chromosome inactivation--may cause extreme discordance, but these extremes are merely the more emphatic examples of discordance that, to some degree, underlies the majority of MZ twin pairs. Because of the entrenched misconception that MZ twins are necessarily identical, many MZ twin pairs are mistakenly designated as dizygotic (DZ). Clinical benefits to accurate zygosity determination include correct solid organ transplantation matching, if one twin requires donation for a non-genetically mediated disease; the opportunity of preventive management for disorders that do not manifest synchronously; and better counseling to parents regarding their individually unique, and often psychologically puzzling, twin offspring. In twin pairs with complex and confusing biological origins, more detailed zygosity testing may be required. For example, intermediate trigametic and tetragametic chimeric dizygotic twins are reviewed, some of whom are, nevertheless, monochorionic (MC). Because of inter-fetal vascular anastomoses in MC twins, genetic results from blood samples may not accurately reflect discordance in solid organs. Previously, it was thought that MZ twinning was some sort of embryological fluke. However, familial monozygotic twinning is more common than suggested by the literature. Seven new families are presented in an accompanying paper. Despite the difficulties and dangers of twin pregnancy (especially so for MC twins), human twinning persists, and continues to both challenge and fascinate parents, clinicians and geneticists.",

Typical signs and symptoms include tachycardia, hypotension, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and disturbed bladder function and sweating regulation. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction may present as Orthostatic Intolerance, Orthostatic Hypotension, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, or Neurally Mediated Hypotension. The incidence, prevalence, and natural history of these conditions remain unquantified, but observations from specialist clinics suggest they are frequently seen in hEDS. There is growing understanding of how hEDS-related physical and physiological pathology contributes to the development of these conditions. Evaluation of cardiovascular symptoms in hEDS should include a careful history and clinical examination. Tests of cardiovascular function range from clinic room observation to tilt-table assessment to other laboratory investigations such as supine and standing catecholamine levels. Non-pharmacologic treatments include education, managing the environment to reduce exposure to triggers, improving cardiovascular fitness, and maintaining hydration. Although there are limited clinical trials, the response to drug treatments in hEDS is supported by evidence from case and cohort observational data, and short-term physiological studies. Pharmacologic therapy is indicated for patients with moderate-severe impairment of daily function and who have inadequate response or tolerance to conservative treatment. Treatment in hEDS often requires a focus on functional maintenance. Also, the negative impact of cardiovascular symptoms on physical and psycho-social well-being may generate a need for a more general evaluation and on-going management and support. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that an association exists between non‐inflammatory hereditary disorders of connective tissue such as the Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Patients with EDS can present with both structural problems such as hiatus hernias, visceroptosis, rectoceles, and rectal prolapse as well as functional problems such as disordered gut motility. It has recently been demonstrated that patients with hypermobile EDS (hEDS) present with GI symptoms related to the fore and hind‐gut and these patients frequently meet the criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders such as functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Presence of GI symptoms in EDS patients influences their quality of life. Specific evidence based management guidelines for the management of GI symptoms in EDS patients do not exist and these patients are often treated symptomatically. There is, however, recognition that certain precautions need to be taken for those patients undergoing surgical treatment. Future studies are required to identify the mechanisms that lead to GI symptoms in patients with EDS and more specific treatment guidelines are required. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a craniofacial anomaly comprising mandibular hypoplasia, cleft secondary palate and glossoptosis leading to life-threatening obstructive apnea and feeding difficulties during the neonatal period. The respiratory issues require careful management and in severe cases may require extended stays in neonatal intensive care units and surgical intervention such as lengthening the lower jaw or tracheotomy to relieve airway obstruction. These feeding and respiratory complications frequently continue well into childhood, affecting not only growth and development but also impacting on long term educational attainment. The diagnosis of PRS depends on readily recognizable clinical features but the phenotypic similarity of many PRS individuals conceals considerable etiological heterogeneity. Defects in the growth of the mandible sit at the core of PRS and the natural history of PRS can be classified into two major streams: primary defects of mandibular outgrowth and elongation and issues that are external to the mandibular skeleton but that secondarily impact on its growth. These altered developmental trajectories appear to be driven by a range of influences including defects in cartilage growth, neuromuscular function and fetal constraint. Various genetic and cytogenetic associations have been made with PRS and the diversity of these associations highlights the fact that there are numerous ways to arrive at this common phenotypic endpoint.",

    "abstract": "Chronic fatigue is an important contributor to impaired health‐related quality of life in Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. There is overlap in the symptoms and findings of EDS and chronic fatigue syndrome. A proportion of those with CFS likely have EDS that has not been identified. The evaluation of chronic fatigue in EDS needs to include a careful clinical examination and laboratory testing to exclude common causes of fatigue including anemia, hypothyroidisim, and chronic infection, as well as dysfunction of major physiological or organ systems. Other problems that commonly contribute to fatigue in EDS include sleep disorders, chronic pain, deconditioning, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, bowel and bladder dysfunction, psychological issues, and nutritional deficiencies. While there is no specific pharmacological treatment for fatigue, many medications are effective for specific symptoms (such as headache, menstrual dysfunction, or myalgia) and for co‐morbid conditions that result in fatigue, including orthostatic intolerance and insomnia. Comprehensive treatment of fatigue needs to also evaluate for biomechanical problems that are common in EDS, and usually involves skilled physical therapy and attention to methods to prevent deconditioning. In addition to managing specific symptoms, treatment of fatigue in EDS also needs to focus on maintaining function and providing social, physical, and nutritional support, as well as providing on‐going medical evaluation of new problems and review of new evidence about proposed treatments. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Molecular genetic lineage analyses have since furthered our insight in the developmental origin of the various component parts of the heart, which currently can be unambiguously identified by their unique molecular phenotype. Moreover, genetic, molecular and cell biological analyses have driven insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of the different cardiac components. Here, we build on our previous review and provide an insight into the molecular mechanistic revelations that have forwarded the field of cardiac development. Despite the enormous advances in our knowledge over the last decade, the development of congenital cardiac malformations remains poorly understood. The challenge for the next decade will be to evaluate the different developmental processes using newly developed molecular genetic techniques to further unveil the gene regulatory networks operational during normal and abnormal cardiac development.",

The etiological spectrum of CH is wide and includes both primary (malformative) and secondary (disruptive) conditions. Primary conditions include chromosomal aberrations (e.g., trisomy 13 and 18), metabolic disorders (e.g., molybdenum cofactor deficiency, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and adenylosuccinase deficiency), genetic syndromes (e.g., Ritscher-Schinzel, Joubert, and CHARGE syndromes), and brain malformations (primary posterior fossa malformations e.g., Dandy-Walker malformation, pontine tegmental cap dysplasia and rhombencephalosynapsis, or global brain malformations such as tubulinopathies and α-dystroglycanopathies). Secondary (disruptive) conditions include prenatal infections (e.g., cytomegalovirus), exposure to teratogens, and extreme prematurity. The distinction between malformations and disruptions is important for pathogenesis and genetic counseling. Neuroimaging provides key information to categorize CH based on the pattern of involvement: unilateral CH, CH with mainly vermis involvement, global CH with involvement of both vermis and hemispheres, and pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The category of CH, associated neuroimaging findings and clinical features may suggest a specific disorder or help plan further investigations and interpret their results. Over the past decade, advances in neuroimaging and genetic testing have greatly improved clinical diagnosis, diagnostic testing, recurrence risk counseling, and information about prognosis for patients and their families. In the next decade, these advances will be translated into deeper understanding of these disorders and more specific treatments.",

To achieve this, we originated The 1,200 Patients Project which offers broad, preemptive pharmacogenomic testing to patients at our institution. We analyzed enrollment, genotype, and encounter‐level data from the first year of implementation to assess utility of providing pharmacogenomic results. Results were delivered via a genomic prescribing system (GPS) in the form of traffic lights: green (favorable), yellow (caution), and red (high risk). Additional supporting information was provided as a virtual pharmacogenomic consult, including citation to relevant publications. Currently, 812 patients have participated, representing 90% of those approached; 608 have been successfully genotyped across a custom array. A total of 268 clinic encounters have occurred at which results were accessible via the GPS. At 86% of visits, physicians accessed the GPS, receiving 367 result signals for medications patients were taking: 57% green lights, 41% yellow lights, and 1.4% red lights. Physician click frequencies to obtain clinical details about alerts varied according to color severity (100% of red were clicked, 72% yellow, 20% green). For 85% of visits, clinical pharmacogenomic information was available for at least one drug the patient was taking, suggesting relevance of the delivered information. We successfully implemented an individualized health care model of preemptive pharmacogenomic testing, delivering results along with pharmacogenomic decision support. Patient interest was robust, physician adoption of information was high, and results were routinely utilized. Ongoing examination of a larger number of clinic encounters and inclusion of more physicians and patients is warranted. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal glycogen storage disorder that is caused by acid α‐glucosidase (GAA) deficiency and is due to pathogenic sequence variations in the corresponding GAA gene. The correlation between genotypes and phenotypes is strict, in that patients with the most severe phenotype, classic infantile Pompe disease, have two pathogenic mutations, one in each GAA allele, that prevent the formation of GAA or totally obliterates its function. All patients with less progressive phenotypes have at least one sequence variation that allows normal or low level synthesis of GAA leading to the formation of analytically measurable, low level GAA activity in most cases. There is an overall trend of finding higher GAA enzyme levels in patients with onset of symptoms in adulthood when compared to patients who show clinical manifestations in early childhood, aged 0–5 years, with a rapidly progressive course, but who lack the severe characteristics of classic infantile Pompe disease. However, several cases have been reported of adult‐onset disease with very low GAA activity, which in all those cases corresponds with the GAA genotype. The clinical diversity observed within a large group of patients with functionally the same GAA genotype and the same c.‐32‐13C &gt; T haplotype demonstrates that modifying factors can have a substantial effect on the clinical course of Pompe disease, disturbing the GAA genotype–phenotype correlation. The present day challenge is to identify these factors and explore them as therapeutic targets. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

These include abnormal mitotic microtubule spindle structure, numerical and structural abnormalities of the centrosome, altered cilia function, impaired DNA repair, DNA Damage Response signaling and DNA replication, along with attenuated cell cycle checkpoint proficiency. Many of these processes are highly interconnected. Interestingly, a defect in a gene whose encoded protein has a canonical function in one of these processes can often have multiple impacts at the cellular level involving several of these pathways.

    "abstract": "Megalencephaly (MEG) is a developmental disorder characterized by brain overgrowth that occurs due to either increased number or size of neurons and glial cells. The former may be due to either increased neuronal proliferation or decreased apoptosis. The degree of brain overgrowth may be extensive, ranging from generalized MEG affecting the entire cortex–as with mutations in PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome ten)–to unilateral hemispheric malformations–as in classic hemimegalencephaly (HME). On the other hand, some lesions are more focal or segmental. These developmental brain abnormalities may occur in isolation in some individuals, whereas others occur in the context of a syndrome involving dysmorphic features, skin findings, or other organ system involvement. Brain overgrowth disorders are often associated with malformations of cortical development, resulting in increased risk of epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autistic features, and some are associated with hydrocephalus. The past few years have witnessed a dramatic leap in our understanding of the molecular basis of brain overgrowth, particularly the identification of mosaic (or post‐zygotic) mutations in core components of key cellular pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K)‐vakt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT)‐mTOR pathway. These molecular insights have broadened our view of brain overgrowth disorders that now appear to span a wide spectrum of overlapping phenotypic, neuroimaging, and neuropathologic features and molecular pathogenesis. These molecular advances also bring to light the possibility of pathway‐based therapies for these often medically devastating developmental disorders. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Cross‐reactive immunological material (CRIM)‐negative status has been recognized as a poor prognostic factor. CRIM‐negative patients make no GAA protein and develop sustained high antibody titers to ERT that render the treatment ineffective. Antibody titers are generally low for the majority of CRIM‐positive patients and there is typically a better clinical outcome. Because immunomodulation has been found to be most effective in CRIM‐negative patients prior to, or shortly after, initiation of ERT, knowledge of CRIM status is important before ERT is begun. We have analyzed 243 patients with infantile Pompe disease using a Western blot method for determining CRIM status and using cultured skin fibroblasts. Sixty‐one out of 243 (25.1%) patients tested from various ethnic backgrounds were found to be CRIM‐negative. We then correlated the CRIM results with GAA gene mutations where available (52 CRIM‐negative and 88 CRIM‐positive patients). We found that, in most cases, CRIM status can be predicted from GAA mutations, potentially circumventing the need for invasive skin biopsy and time wasted in culturing cells in the future. Continued studies in this area will help to increase the power of GAA gene mutations in predicting CRIM status as well as possibly identifying CRIM‐positive patients who are at risk for developing high antibody titers. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Initially we used uniparental DNA markers to investigate the contribution of distinct Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA lineages to present-day populations. High levels of genetic admixture and strong directional mating between European males and Amerindian and African females were unraveled. We next analyzed different types of biparental autosomal polymorphisms. Especially useful was a set of 40 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) that when studied worldwide proved exquisitely sensitive in discriminating between Amerindians, Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans. When applied to the study of Brazilians these markers confirmed extensive genomic admixture. We then studied ancestry differences in different regions by statistically controlling them to eliminate color considerations. The European ancestry was predominant in all regions studied, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South. We propose that the immigration of 6 million Europeans to Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries is in large part responsible for dissipating previous ancestry dissimilarities that reflected region-specific population histories. Brazilians should be assessed individually, as 210 million human beings, and not as members of specific regions or color groups.",

JHS/EDS-HT also presents with other connective tissue features affecting a variety of structures and organs, such as skin, eye, bone, and internal organs. However, most of these signs are present in variable combinations and severity in many other heritable connective tissue disorders. Accordingly, JHS/EDS-HT is an \"exclusion\" diagnosis which needs the absence of any consistent feature indicative of other partially overlapping connective tissue disorders. While both Villefranche and Brighton criteria include such an exclusion as a mandatory item, a systematic approach for reaching a stringent clinical diagnosis of JHS/EDS-HT is still lacking. The absence of a consensus on the diagnostic approach to JHS/EDS-HT concerning its clinical boundaries with similar conditions contribute to limit our actual understanding of the pathologic and molecular bases of this disorder. In this review, we revise the differential diagnosis of JHS/EDS-HT with those heritable connective tissue disorders which show a significant overlap with the former and mostly include EDS classic, vascular and kyphoscoliotic types, osteogenesis imperfecta, Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, arterial tortuosity syndrome, and lateral meningocele syndrome. A diagnostic flow chart is also offered with the attempt to support the less experienced clinician in stringently recognizing JHS/EDS-HT and stimulate the debate in the scientific community for both management and research purposes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract PTEN is a dual‐specificity phosphatase and well‐known tumor suppressor gene. When functioning properly, it works in its canonical pathway to inhibit AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling, leading to cell death and growth regulation. PTEN mutations cause dysregulation of these pathways, resulting in cellular proliferation and overgrowth. When germline mutations are present as in patients with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS), benign and malignant neoplasias occur as well as cerebral overgrowth and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. This review article will summarize recent laboratory and clinical investigations relating to PTEN , highlighting the overgrowth aspects of this syndrome and the molecular drivers behind these key phenotypes. Finally, therapies developed targeted the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway for other tumor predisposition syndromes will be discussed. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X‐linked recessive disorder that is typically characterized by cardiomyopathy (CMP), skeletal myopathy, growth retardation, neutropenia, and increased urinary levels of 3‐methylglutaconic acid (3‐MGCA). There may be a wide variability of phenotypes amongst BTHS patients with some exhibiting some or all of these findings. BTHS was first described as a disease of the mitochondria resulting in neutropenia as well as skeletal and cardiac myopathies. Over the past few years, a greater understanding of BTHS has developed related to the underlying genetic mechanisms responsible for the disease. Mutations in the TAZ gene on chromosome Xq28, also known as G4.5, are responsible for the BTHS phenotype resulting in a loss‐of‐function in the protein product tafazzin. Clinical management of BTHS has also seen improvement. Patients with neutropenia are susceptible to life‐threatening bacterial infections with sepsis being a significant concern for possible morbidity and mortality. Increasingly, BTHS patients are suffering from heart failure secondary to their CMP. Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) and dilated CMP are the most common cardiac phenotypes reported and can lead to symptoms of heart failure as well as ventricular arrhythmias. Expanded treatment options for end‐stage myocardial dysfunction now offer an opportunity to change the natural history for these patients. Herein, we will provide a current review of the genetic and molecular basis of BTHS, the clinical features and management of BTHS, and potential future directions for therapeutic strategies. © 2013 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Polymicrogyria (PMG) is one of the most common malformations of cortical development. It is characterized by overfolding of the cerebral cortex and abnormal cortical layering. It is a highly heterogeneous malformation with variable clinical and imaging features, pathological findings, and etiologies. It may occur as an isolated cortical malformation, or in association with other malformations within the brain or body as part of a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. Polymicrogyria shows variable topographic patterns with the bilateral perisylvian pattern being most common. Schizencephaly is a subtype of PMG in which the overfolded cortex lines full‐thickness clefts connecting the subarachnoid space with the cerebral ventricles. Both genetic and non‐genetic causes of PMG have been identified. Non‐genetic causes include congenital cytomegalovirus infection and in utero ischemia. Genetic causes include metabolic conditions such as peroxisomal disorders and the 22q11.2 and 1p36 continguous gene deletion syndromes. Mutations in over 30 genes have been found in association with PMG, especially mutations in the tubulin family of genes. Mutations in the (PI3K)‐AKT pathway have been found in association PMG and megalencephaly. Despite recent genetic advances, the mechanisms by which polymicrogyric cortex forms and causes of the majority of cases remain unknown, making diagnostic and prenatal testing and genetic counseling challenging. This review summarizes the clinical, imaging, pathologic, and etiologic features of PMG, highlighting recent genetic advances. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an inherited aminoaciduria caused by defective cationic amino acid transport at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in intestine and kidney. LPI is caused by mutations in the SLC7A7 gene, which encodes the y + LAT‐1 protein, the catalytic light chain subunit of a complex belonging to the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family. LPI was initially described in Finland, but has worldwide distribution. Typically, symptoms begin after weaning with refusal of feeding, vomiting, and consequent failure to thrive. Hepatosplenomegaly, hematological anomalies, neurological involvement, including hyperammonemic coma are recurrent clinical features. Two major complications, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and renal disease are increasingly observed in LPI patients. There is extreme variability in the clinical presentation even within individual families, frequently leading to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. This condition is diagnosed by urine amino acids, showing markedly elevated excretion of lysine and other dibasic amino acids despite low plasma levels of lysine, ornithine, and arginine. The biochemical diagnosis can be uncertain, requiring confirmation by DNA testing. So far, approximately 50 different mutations have been identified in the SLC7A7 gene in a group of 142 patients from 110 independent families. No genotype–phenotype correlation could be established. Therapy requires a low protein diet, low‐dose citrulline supplementation, nitrogen‐scavenging compounds to prevent hyperammonemia, lysine, and carnitine supplements. Supportive therapy is available for most complications with bronchoalveolar lavage being necessary for alveolar proteinosis. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sirenomelia is a very rare limb anomaly in which the normally paired lower limbs are replaced by a single midline limb. This study describes the prevalence, associated malformations, and maternal characteristics among cases with sirenomelia. Data originated from 19 birth defect surveillance system members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research, and were reported according to a single pre‐established protocol. Cases were clinically evaluated locally and reviewed centrally. A total of 249 cases with sirenomelia were identified among 25,290,172 births, for a prevalence of 0.98 per 100,000, with higher prevalence in the Mexican registry. An increase of sirenomelia prevalence with maternal age less than 20 years was statistically significant. The proportion of twinning was 9%, higher than the 1% expected. Sex was ambiguous in 47% of cases, and no different from expectation in the rest. The proportion of cases born alive, premature, and weighting less than 2,500 g were 47%, 71.2%, and 88.2%, respectively. Half of the cases with sirenomelia also presented with genital, large bowel, and urinary defects. About 10–15% of the cases had lower spinal column defects, single or anomalous umbilical artery, upper limb, cardiac, and central nervous system defects. There was a greater than expected association of sirenomelia with other very rare defects such as bladder exstrophy, cyclopia/holoprosencephaly, and acardia‐acephalus. The application of the new biological network analysis approach, including molecular results, to these associated very rare diseases is suggested for future studies. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Trisomy 13 and 18 are life-limiting conditions for which a palliative approach is frequently recommended. The objective of this study was to examine parental goals/decisions, the length of life of their child and factors associated with survival. Parents of children who lived with trisomy 13 or 18 that were part of English-speaking social networks were invited to participate in a questionnaire study. Participants answered questions about their hopes/goals, decisions regarding neonatal interventions, and the duration of their children's lives. The participants were 332 parents who answered questions about their 272 children (87% response rate based on site visits; 67% on invitations sent). When parents were asked about their hope after the diagnosis, the main themes invoked by parents were the following: meet their child alive (80% of parents with a prenatal diagnosis), spend some time as a family (72%), bring their child home (52%), and give their child a good life (66%). Parents wanted to give them a chance, but also reported their fears were medical complexity, pain and/or life in the hospital (61%). Healthcare providers recommended comfort care at birth to all parents. Life-sustaining interventions \"as for any other child\" was chosen as a plan of care by 25% of parents. Of the 216 children with full trisomy, 69% were discharged home after birth and 40% lived >1 y. The presence of a prenatal diagnosis was the strongest independent factor negatively associated with longevity: 36% of children with a prenatal diagnosis lived <24 hr and 47% were discharged home compared to 1% and 87%, respectively for children with a postnatal diagnosis (P < 0.01). Male gender, low-birth weight, and cardiac and/or cerebral anomaly were also associated with decreased survival (P < 0.05). After a prenatal diagnosis, palliative care at birth consisted of limited interventions, whereas after a postnatal diagnosis (median age of 6 days) it consisted of various interventions, including oxygen, ventilation, tube feeding and intravenous fluids, complicating the analysis. In conclusion, the goals of parents of children with trisomy 13 or 18 were to meet their child, be discharged home and be a family. Having a postnatal diagnosis was the independent factor most associated with these goals. Children with a postnatal diagnosis were treated \"as any other children\" until the diagnosis, which may give them a survival advantage, independent of palliative care. Rigorous transparency regarding specific interventions and outcomes may help personalize care for these children. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Human growth is a complex process starting at conception and completing in adolescence at the time of growth plate fusion. Growth can be divided into four phases: (1) fetal, where the predominant endocrine factors controlling growth are insulin and the insulin‐like growth factors. (2) Infancy, where growth is mainly dependent upon nutrition. (3) Childhood, where the growth hormone–insulin‐like growth factor‐I (GH‐IGF‐I) axis and thyroid hormone are most important. (4) Puberty, where along with the GH‐IGF‐I axis the activation of the hypothalamo‐pituitary–gonadal axis to generate sex steroid secretion becomes vital to the completion of growth. GH is released from the pituitary in a pulsatile fashion under the control of GHRH, Ghrelin, and somatostatin and, via a complex signal transduction cascade, initiates the release of IGF‐I within many tissues but predominantly the liver and at the growth plate. IGF‐I acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner via the IGF‐I receptor to stimulate cell proliferation and longitudinal growth. Activation of the pituitary–gonadal axis during puberty occurs via a complex interaction of factors including kisspeptin, leptin, gonadotrophin releasing hormone, and tachykinin ultimately leading to augmentation of GH secretion, the pubertal growth spurt, and fusion of the growth plates. Many other hormones can affect the GH‐IGF‐I system or directly affect cell proliferation at the growth plate including thyroid hormone, vitamin D, and corticosteroids. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Noonan syndrome is a pleomorphic genetic disorder, in which a high percentage of affected individuals have cardiovascular involvement, most prevalently various forms of congenital heart disease (i.e., pulmonary valve stenosis, septal defects, left‐sided lesions, and complex forms with multiple anomalies). Care includes attentiveness to several comorbidities, some directly impacting cardiac management (bleeding diatheses and lymphatic anomalies). More than 50% of patients with Noonan syndrome harbor PTPN11 pathogenic variation, which results in hyperactivation of RAS/mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling. Several other disease genes with similar biological effects have been uncovered for NS and phenotypically related disorders, collectively called the RASopathies. Molecular diagnosis with gene resequencing panels is now widely available, but phenotype variability and in some cases, subtlety, continues to make identification of Noonan syndrome difficult. Until genetic testing becomes universal for patients with congenital heart disease, alertness to Noonan syndrome's broad clinical presentations remains crucial. Genotype–phenotype associations for Noonan syndrome enable better prognostication for affected patients when a molecular diagnosis is established. We still lack Noonan syndrome‐specific treatment; however, newly developed anticancer RAS pathway inhibitors could fill that gap if safety and efficacy can be established for indications such as pulmonary valve stenosis.",

ACC may be isolated, or occur in association with other neuroanatomical lesions and/or congenital anomalies, and has many different genetic causes. Neuropsychological outcome varies considerably from normal to profound intellectual disability depending on the etiology. Approximately 25% of individuals with antenatally diagnosed apparently isolated ACC have intellectual disability. Subtle neurological, social, and learning deficits may still occur in those with normal intelligence and longitudinal neurocognitive follow‐up is recommended for all children with ACC. The finding of ACC should prompt detailed clinical assessment in order to determine and manage the underlying condition. It is recognized that genetic factors contribute to ACC in the vast majority of cases. Less commonly ACC can result from antenatal infections, vascular or toxic insults, and it is increasingly recognized that ACC, particularly isolated ACC, may be due to an interaction of a number of “modifier” genetic and environmental factors. There are a large number of genetic conditions in which ACC may be a feature. We suggest a diagnostic algorithm to help guide the clinician towards diagnosis, to provide outcome advice and to aid in genetic counseling. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Since the advent of ERT a lot has been learned about the phenotypic spectrum especially in the late onset patients. We describe in detail 44 patients diagnosed with late‐onset Pompe disease (LOPD) at our neuromuscular department from 1985 to 2011 and compare them to patients with LOPD in the literature of the past 40 years. Study of the Munich LOPD group revealed varying musculoskeletal and cardio‐cerebrovascular manifestation patterns. Several of these symptom patterns commonly appeared in conjunction with one another, highlighting the multisystem involvement of this condition. Common symptom patterns include: (i) Classic limb girdle and diaphragmatic weakness, (ii) rigid spine syndrome (RSS), scoliosis, and low body mass, and (iii) several cardio‐cerebrovascular manifestation patterns. The most common presentation, limb girdle and diaphragmatic weakness, appeared in 78% (34/44) of our patients and over 80% of those in the literature. Sixteen percent (7/44) of our patients presented with rigid spine, scoliosis, and low body mass. Although scoliosis had a reported frequency of 33% in the general LOPD patient population, the literature only occasionally reported low body mass and RSS. Importantly, a multisystem extramuscular finding accompanied by cardio‐cerebrovascular manifestations was found in 29% (13/44) of our LOPD patients; the literature showed an increasing prevalence of this latter finding. By examining the phenotype of patients with confirmed LOPD, we found a more subtle clinical multisystem involvement in LOPD. Whether patients presenting with the different symptom patterns respond differently to enzyme replacement therapy remains a key question for future research. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The phenotype varies widely; the most common features include: facial dysmorphia, hypocalcemia, palate and speech disorders, feeding and gastrointestinal disorders, immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, and congenital heart disease. Approximately 60–80% of patients have a cardiac malformation most commonly including a subset of conotruncal defects (tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch type B), conoventricular and/or atrial septal defects, and aortic arch anomalies. Cardiac patients with a 22q11.2 deletion do not generally experience higher mortality upon surgical intervention but suffer more peri‐operative complications than their non‐syndromic counterparts. New guidelines suggest screening for a 22q11.2 deletion in the patient with tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch type B, conoventricular septal defects as well as those with an isolated aortic arch anomaly. Early identification of a 22q11.2 deletion in the neonate or infant when other syndromic features may not be apparent allows for timely parental screening for reproductive counseling and anticipatory evaluation of cardiac and noncardiac features. Screening the at‐risk child or adult allows for important age‐specific clinical, neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and reproductive issues to be addressed.",

CSS is a rare congenital malformation syndrome characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability (ID), coarse facial appearance, feeding difficulties, frequent infections, and hypoplasia/aplasia of the fifth fingernails and fifth distal phalanges. In 2012, 42 years after the first description of CSS in 1970, five causative genes ( SMARCB1 , SMARCE1 , SMARCA4 , ARID1A , ARID1B ), all encoding components of the BAF complex, were identified as being responsible for CSS through whole exome sequencing and pathway‐based genetic screening. The identification of two additional causative genes ( PHF6 , SOX11 ) followed. Mutations in another BAF complex gene ( SMARCA2 ) and ( TBC1D24) were found to cause clinically similar conditions with ID, Nicolaides–Baraitser syndrome and DOORS syndrome, respectively. Also, ADNP was found to be mutated in an autism/ID syndrome. Furthermore, there is growing evidences for germline or somatic mutations in the BAF complex genes to be causal for cancer/cancer predisposition syndromes. These discoveries have highlighted the role of the BAF complex in the human development and cancer formation. The biology of BAF is very complicated and much remains unknown. Ongoing research is required to reveal the whole picture of the BAF complex in human development, and will lead to the development of new targeted therapies for related disorders in the future. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The syndrome is characterized by varying degrees of cognitive, social, behavioral, and learning difficulties and in adulthood additionally primary testicular failure with small testes, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, tall stature, and eunuchoid body proportions. The phenotype is variable ranging from \"near-normal\" to a significantly affected individual. In addition, newborns with Klinefelter syndrome generally present with a normal male phenotype and the only consistent clinical finding in KS is small testes, that are most often not identified until after puberty. Decreased awareness of this syndrome among health professionals and a general perception that all patients with 47,XXY exhibit the classic textbook phenotype results in a highly under-diagnosed condition with up to 75% of the patients left undetected. Typically, diagnosis is delayed with the majority of patients identified during fertility workup in adulthood, and only 10% of patients diagnosed prior to puberty. Early detection of this syndrome is recommended in order to offer treatment and intervention at the appropriate ages and stages of development for the purpose of preventing osteopenia/osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, and other medical conditions related to hypogonadism and to the XXY as well as minimizing potential learning and psychosocial problems.

Here, we present a clinical update on TSC‐associated neuropsychiatric disorders, abbreviated as “TAND,” to guide screening, diagnosis, and treatment in practice. The review is aimed at clinical geneticists, genetic counselors, pediatricians, and all generalists involved in the assessment and treatment of children, adolescents and adults with TSC, and related disorders. The review starts with a summary of the construct and levels of TAND, before presenting up‐to‐date information about each level of investigation. The review concludes with a synopsis of current and future TAND research.",

    "abstract": "The return of individual results to research participants has been vigorously debated. Consensus statements indicate that researchers and bioethicists consider the return of research results most appropriate when the findings are clinically relevant. Even when clinical utility is the motivator, however, the return of individual research results is not equivalent to clinical care. There are important differences in the domains of research and medical care, both from a legal standpoint and in terms of the ethical responsibilities of clinicians and researchers. As a corollary, researchers risk promoting a therapeutic misconception if they create quasi‐clinical settings for return of clinically relevant research results. Rather, efforts should be focused on clarity in the provision of research results, appropriate caveats and, most important, appropriate referrals when the results may be helpful to consider in medical care. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The second was the growing concern, in the absence of genetic diagnosis, that the hypermobile type of EDS had an expanded phenotype, may be genetically heterogeneous, and that the diagnostic criteria currently in use were inadequate. Furthermore, there is a dire need for the development of guidelines for management for each type of EDS to allow both the specialist and the generalist to care for affected individuals and their families.

    "abstract": "Well known for their role in allergic disorders, mast cells (MCs) play a key role in homeostatic mechanisms and surveillance, recognizing and responding to different pathogens, and tissue injury, with an array of chemical mediators. After being recruited to connective tissues, resident MCs progenitors undergo further differentiation, under the influence of signals from surrounding microenvironment. It is the differential tissue homing and local maturation factors which result in a diverse population of resident MC phenotypes. An abundance of MC reside in connective tissue that borders with the external world (the skin as well as gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts). Situated near nerve fibers, lymphatics, and blood vessels, as well as coupled with their ability to secrete potent mediators, MCs can modulate the function of local and distant structures (e.g., other immune cell populations, fibroblasts, angiogenesis), and MC dysregulation has been implicated in immediate and delayed hypersensitivity syndromes, neuropathies, and connective tissue disorders (CTDs). This report reviews basic biology of mast cells and mast cell activation as well as recent research efforts, which implicate a role of MC dysregulation beyond atopic disorders and in a cluster of Ehlers–Danlos Syndromes, non‐IGE mediated hypersensitivity disorders, and dysautonomia. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Previous reports of patients with BWS have focused on those with the more recognizable, classic features, and limited information is available on those who fit into the atypical and ILO categories.

Focal forms of megalencephaly associated with cortical dysplasia, such as hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia, are common causes of focal intractable epilepsy in children. The increasing use of high throughput sequencing methods, including high depth sequencing to more accurately detect and quantify mosaic mutations, has allowed us to identify the molecular etiologies of many MEG syndromes, including most notably the PI3K‐AKT‐MTOR related MEG disorders. Thorough molecular and clinical characterization of affected individuals further allow us to derive preliminary genotype–phenotype correlations depending on the gene, mutation, level of mosaicism, and tissue distribution. Our review of published data on these disorders so far shows that mildly activating variants (that are typically constitutional or germline) are associated with diffuse megalencephaly with intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder; moderately activating variants (that are typically high‐level mosaic) are associated with megalencephaly with pigmentary abnormalities of the skin; and strongly activating variants (that are usually very low‐level mosaic) are associated with focal brain malformations including hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia. Accurate molecular diagnosis of these disorders is undoubtedly crucial to more optimally treat children with these disorders using PI3K‐AKT–MTOR pathway inhibitors.",

In RASopathies, increased RAS‐MAPK signaling can result from the upregulated activity of various RAS GTPases, enhanced function of proteins positively controlling RAS function or favoring the efficient transmission of RAS signaling to downstream transducers, functional upregulation of RAS effectors belonging to the MAPK cascade, or inefficient signaling switch‐off operated by feedback mechanisms acting at different levels. The massive effort in RASopathy gene discovery performed in the last 20 years has identified more than 20 genes implicated in these disorders. It has also facilitated the characterization of several molecular activating mechanisms that had remained unappreciated due to their minor impact in oncogenesis. Here, we provide an overview on the discoveries collected during the last 5 years that have delivered unexpected insights (e.g., Noonan syndrome as a recessive disease) and allowed to profile new RASopathies, novel disease genes and new molecular circuits contributing to the control of RAS‐MAPK signaling.",

Accurately evaluating complex molecular data to facilitate timely diagnosis and management of genomic disorders will require supportive artificial intelligence methods. These are already being introduced into clinical laboratory genomics to identify variants in DNA sequencing data, predict the effects of DNA variants on protein structure and function to inform clinical interpretation of pathogenicity, link phenotype ontologies to genetic variants identified through exome or genome sequencing to help clinicians reach diagnostic answers faster, correlate genomic data with tumor staging and treatment approaches, utilize natural language processing to identify critical published medical literature during analysis of genomic data, and use interactive chatbots to identify individuals who qualify for genetic testing or to provide pre‐test and post‐test education. With careful and ethical development and validation of artificial intelligence for clinical laboratory genomics, these advances are expected to significantly enhance the abilities of geneticists to translate complex data into clearly synthesized information for clinicians to use in managing the care of their patients at scale.",

This article describes findings from a qualitative study of 39 adult members from five families with known HNPCC‐predisposing mutations. We evaluated how information from HNPCC genetic counseling and testing was disseminated in these families and how family members reacted to and acted on this information. We included family members who had been diagnosed with an HNPCC syndrome cancer, unaffected individuals who were at 50% risk of carrying a mutation, and their spouses. Participants included those who had undergone testing and those who had not. In general, all families had shared the news about an HNPCC mutation with at‐risk relatives. Communication about HNPCC genetic counseling and testing followed the norms used for conveying other nonurgent family news. Mutation noncarriers, nontesters, and those who were not biological relatives were less involved in discussing genetic counseling and testing and perceived these processes as less relevant to them. Although all family members were generally willing to share information about HNPCC, probands and mutation carriers informed extended family members and actively persuaded others to seek counseling or testing. Family members who were persuaded to seek those services by the proband were more likely to have counseling and testing and were more likely to seek those services sooner. Genetic counseling should attempt to identify the existing communication norms within families and ways that family members can take an active role in encouraging others to learn about their cancer risk and options for testing. Interventions may also need to emphasize the relevance of hereditary cancer information beyond the immediate family and to unaffected family members who may be central to the communication process (e.g., spouses of mutation carriers). © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Ectodermal dysplasias are a large group of heritable conditions characterized by congenital defects of one or more ectodermal structures and their appendages: hair (hypotrichosis, partial, or total alopecia), nails (dystrophic, hypertrophic, abnormally keratinized), teeth (enamel defect or absent), and sweat glands (hypoplastic or aplastic). The ectodermal dysplasias, as a rule, are not pure \"one-layer diseases.\" Mesodermal and, rarely, endodermal dysplasias coexist. Embryogenesis exhibits distinct tissue organizational fields and specific interactions among the germ layers that may lead to a wide range of ectodermal dysplasias when genes important for development are mutated or otherwise altered in expression. Of the approximately 200 different ectodermal dysplasias, about 30 have been studied at the molecular level with identification of the causative gene. Freire-Maia and Pinheiro used the clinical aspects for their classification, and Priolo integrated molecular genetic and clinical aspects for her scheme. Those two more historical classification schemes have the difficulty that, when applied strictly, several additional groups of diseases should be integrated within the term \"ectodermal dysplasias,\" e.g. keratodermas with skin or hair alterations or the ichthyoses with associated features. Such consequent classification would lead to an endless list of diseases and would be useless for the practical work. Recent evidence implicates a genetic defect in different pathways orchestrating ectodermal organogenesis. Modern molecular genetics will increasingly elucidate the basic defects of the different syndromes and yield more insight into the regulatory mechanisms of embryology. In this way, a reclassification of ectodermal dysplasias will be possible according to the function of their involved mutated genes. Lamartine recently proposed a helpful classification according to the functions of the genes discovered in different types of ectodermal dysplasias. Accordingly, the present overview categorizes the various ectodermal dysplasias into four major functional subgroups: cell-cell communication and signaling, adhesion, transcription regulation, and development.",

In the last decade, researchers have utilized quantitative structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the brains of living children and adults with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. In addition to microcephaly, these studies indicated structural abnormalities in various regions of the brain, including the cerebellum, corpus callosum, and the basal ganglia. Most recently, we have utilized novel imaging and analytic techniques to study the brain as a whole in an effort to elucidate more subtle differences than was possible with earlier techniques. Results indicated displacements in the corpus callosum, increased gray matter densities in both hemispheres in the perisylvian regions, and altered gray matter asymmetry in portions of the temporal lobes in the brains of alcohol‐exposed subjects. In addition, prominent shape abnormalities were observed in the brains of these subjects, with narrowing in the temporal region and reduced brain growth in portions of the frontal lobe. These results imply that brain growth continues to be adversely affected long after the prenatal insult and that the brain regions most affected may be consistent with the neurocognitive deficits characteristic of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

It is a condition of great concern for public health and society. MR is currently defined as a significant impairment of cognitive and adaptive functions, with onset before age 18 years. It may become evident during infancy or early childhood as developmental delay (DD), but it is best diagnosed during the school years. MR is estimated to occur in 1-10% of the population, and research on its etiology has always been a challenge in medicine. The etiopathogenesis encompasses so many different entities that the attending physician can sometimes feel a \"virtual panic,\" starting a wide-range diagnostic evaluation. The Consensus Conference of the American College of Medical Genetics has recently established guidelines regarding the evaluation of patients with MR [Curry et al., 1997], emphasizing the high diagnostic utility of cytogenetic studies and neuroimaging in certain clinical settings. However, since then there has been substantial progress in molecular cytogenetics and neuroimaging techniques, the use of which has allowed recognition and definition of new disorders, thus increasing the diagnostic yield. This review will focus on the most appropriate investigations shown to be, at present, necessary to define the etiology of DD/MR, in the context of recommendations for the clinical evaluation of the patient with undiagnosed MR.",

The core symptoms of autism include deficits in social interaction, impaired communication, and aberrant repetitive behavior, including self‐injury. Despite the strong genetic component for the disease, most cases of autism have not been linked to mutations in a specific gene, and the etiology of the disorder has yet to be established. At the present time, there is no generally accepted therapeutic strategy to treat the core symptoms of autism, and there remains a critical need for appropriate animal models and relevant behavioral assays to promote the understanding and treatment of the clinical syndrome. Challenges for the development of valid mouse models include complex genetic interactions underlying the high heritability of the disease in humans, diagnosis based on deficits in social interaction and communication, and the lack of confirmatory neuropathological markers to provide validation for genetic models of the disorder. Research focusing on genes that mediate social behavior in mice may help identify neural circuitry essential for normal social interaction, and lead to novel genetic animal models of the autism behavioral phenotype. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Maternal diabetes increases the risk for neural tube, and other, structural defects. The mother may have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but the diabetes must be existing at the earliest stages of pregnancy, during which organogenesis occurs. Abnormally high glucose levels in maternal blood, which leads to increased glucose transport to the embryo, is responsible for the teratogenic effects of maternal diabetes. Consequently, expression of genes that control essential developmental processes is disturbed. In this review, some of the biochemical pathways by which excess glucose metabolism disturbs neural tube formation are discussed. Research from the author's laboratory has shown that expression of Pax3 , a gene required for neural tube closure, is significantly reduced by maternal diabetes, and this is associated with significantly increased neural tube defects (NTD). Pax3 encodes a transcription factor that has recently been shown to inhibit p53‐dependent apoptosis. Evidence in support of this model, in which excess glucose metabolism inhibits expression of Pax3 , thereby derepressing p53‐dependent apoptosis of neuroepithelium and leading to NTD will be discussed. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Here we focus on the stroke-like nature of striatal necrosis and its similarity to brain injury that occurs in infants after hypoxia-ischemia or systemic intoxication with 3-nitropropionic acid (NPA). These conditions share several features including abrupt onset, preferential effect in the striatum and age-specific susceptibility. The pathophysiology of the conditions is reviewed and a model proposed herein. We encourage investigators to test this model in an appropriate experimental system.",

    "abstract": "Gastroschisis is an abdominal wall defect typically located to the right of the umbilical cord in which intestines and occasionally other abdominal contents herniate through the abdominal wall opening. The etiology of this defect is unknown. The increased recurrence risks observed in families with a child with gastroschisis suggest that genetic factors play a role in its causation. However, non-genetic factors are also important, as evidenced by the increased occurrence of gastroschisis among younger mothers, the increasing prevalence of gastroschisis in recent years observed by several birth defects surveillance systems, and the frequent occurrence of gastroschisis in a cluster pattern. Despite recognition of the importance of non-genetic factors in gastroschisis causation, no factors, other than young maternal age, have been definitively identified, limiting the development of prevention strategies. This article summarizes the currently available literature on non-genetic risk factors for gastroschisis, including investigations of sociodemographic factors, maternal therapeutic medication and non-therapeutic drug exposures, chemical exposures, and other factors. The article also discusses some of the challenges faced by investigators working to better understand gastroschisis etiology.",

Glutaric acidemia type 1 (GA‐1) is an autosomal recessive disorder of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan metabolism caused by deficiency of glutaryl‐CoA dehydrogenase. It results in the accumulation of 3‐hydroxyglutaric and glutaric acid. Affected patients can present with brain atrophy and macrocephaly and with acute dystonia secondary to striatal degeneration in most cases triggered by an intercurrent childhood infection with fever between 6 and 18 months of age. This disorder can be identified by increased glutaryl (C5DC) carnitine on newborn screening. Urine organic acid analysis indicates the presence of excess 3‐OH‐glutaric acid, and urine acylcarnitine profile shows glutaryl carnitine as the major peak. Therapy consists in carnitine supplementation to remove glutaric acid, a diet restricted in amino acids capable of producing glutaric acid, and prompt treatment of intercurrent illnesses. Early diagnosis and therapy reduce the risk of acute dystonia in patients with GA‐1. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus type 1 (TNDM1) is a rare but remarkable form of diabetes which presents in infancy, resolves in the first months of life, but then frequently recurs in later life. It is caused by overexpression of the imprinted genes PLAGL1 and HYMAI on human chromosome 6q24. The expression of these genes is normally restricted to the paternal allele as a result of maternal DNA methylation. TNDM1 is not associated with mutation of PLAGL1 or HYMAI , but rather with their overexpression via uniparental disomy, chromosome duplication, or relaxation of imprinting. Study of patients with TNDM1 has provided valuable insights into the causes of imprinting disorders. Over half of patients with maternal hypomethylation at the TNDM1 locus have additional hypomethylation of other maternally methylated imprinted genes throughout the genome, and the majority of these patients have mutations in the transcription factor ZFP57. TNDM1 with maternal hypomethylation has also been observed in patients conceived by assisted reproduction, and in discordant monozygotic twins. The variable clinical features of TNDM1 may be associated with variation in the nature of the underlying epigenetic and genetic mutations, and future study of this disorder is likely to yield further insights not only into the biological mechanisms of imprinting, but also into the contribution of epigenetics to diabetes. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neural tube defects (NTD), including anencephaly and spina bifida, are a group of severe congenital abnormalities in which the future brain and/or spinal cord fail to close. In mice, NTD may result from genetic mutations or knockouts, or from exposure to teratogenic agents, several of which are known risk factors in humans. Among the many mouse NTD models that have been identified to date, a number have been tested for possible primary prevention of NTD by exogenous agents, such as folic acid. In genetic NTD models such as Cart1 , splotch , Cited2 , and crooked tail , and NTD induced by teratogens including valproic acid and fumonisins, the incidence of defects is reduced by maternal folic acid supplementation. These folate‐responsive models provide an opportunity to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying prevention of NTD by folic acid in humans. In another group of mouse models, that includes curly tail , axial defects , and the Ephrin‐A5 knockout, NTD are not preventable by folic acid, reflecting the situation in humans in which a subset of NTD appear resistant to folic acid therapy. In this group of mutants alternative preventive agents, including inositol and methionine, have been shown to be effective. Overall, the data from mouse models suggests that a broad‐based in utero therapy may offer scope for prevention of a greater proportion of NTD than is currently possible. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

This study addresses the question by documenting, on videotape, the practices of a national sample of prenatal and cancer genetic counselors (GCs) providing routine pre-test counseling to simulated clients (SCs). One hundred and seventy-seven GCs recruited at two annual conferences of the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) were randomly assigned to counsel one of six female SCs of varying ethnicity, with or without a spouse, in their specialty. One hundred and fifty-two videotapes were coded with the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) and both GCs and SCs completed evaluative questionnaires. Two teaching and two counseling patterns of practice emerged from cluster analysis. The teaching patterns included: (1) clinical teaching (31%) characterized by low psychosocial, emotional and facilitative talk, high levels of clinical exchange, and high verbal dominance; and (2) psycho-educational teaching (27%) characterized by high levels of both clinical and psychosocial exchange, low levels of emotional and facilitative talk, and higher verbal dominance. The counseling patterns included: (1) supportive counseling (33%) characterized by low psychosocial and clinical exchange, high levels of emotional and facilitative talk, and low verbal dominance; and (2) psychosocial counseling (9%) with high emotional and facilitative talk, low clinical and high psychosocial exchange, and the lowest verbal dominance. SCs ratings of satisfaction with communication, the counselor's affective demeanor, and the counselor's use of non-verbal skills were highest for the counseling model sessions. Both the teaching and counseling models seem to be represented in routine practice and predict variation in client satisfaction, affective demeanor, and nonverbal effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The wide variation in cerebral and facial phenotypes and the recognized etiologic heterogeneity of holoprosencephaly (HPE) contribute to the observed inter‐study heterogeneity. High lethality during the early stages of embryonic and fetal development makes HPE detection age dependent. By reviewing 21 HPE epidemiologic articles, the observed prevalence rate differences can be largely explained by the pregnancy outcome status of the studied cohort: livebirth, stillbirth, and terminations of pregnancy (TOPs): lower than 1 per 10,000 when live and still births were included, higher when TOPs were included, and between 40 and 50 per 10,000 in two classical Japanese studies on aborted embryos. The increasing secular trend observed in some studies probably resulted from an increasing use of prenatal sonography. Ethnic variations in birth prevalence rates (BPRs) could occur in HPE, but the available data are not very convincing. Higher BPRs were generally observed in the less favored minorities (Blacks, Hispanics, Pakistanis), suggesting a bias caused by a lower prenatal detection rate of HPE, and consequently less TOPs. Severe ear defects, as well as microstomia, were part of the spectrum of HPE. Non‐craniofacial anomalies, more frequently associated with HPE than expected, were genital anomalies (24%), postaxial polydactyly (8%), vertebral defects (5%), limb reduction defects (4%), and transposition of great arteries (4%). The variable female predominance, found in different HPE studies, could also depend on the proportion of early conceptions in each study sample, as males are more likely to be lost through spontaneous abortions. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

In this article, we review studies of offspring at risk for anxiety disorders, longitudinal studies of the course of anxiety disorders in clinical, epidemiologic, and at‐risk samples, studies of hypothesized temperamental risk factors for anxiety, and give a brief overview of the literature on environmental risk factors. Clear developmental antecedents to anxiety disorders identified include (1) childhood anxiety disorders [in particular, separation anxiety and overanxious disorder/general anxiety disorder (GAD)], (2) behavioral inhibition which predicts later social phobia, (3) anxiety sensitivity which predicts later panic disorder, and (4) negative affectivity, which predicts a spectrum of psychopathology including anxiety disorders. Further prospective studies are needed to examine the roles of environmental factors such as parenting practices, peer influences, stressful life events, and perinatal stressors. Future studies could benefit from (1) beginning earlier in development and following individuals into adulthood, (2) assessing the overlap between multiple temperamental constructs, (3) greater use of observational measures of temperament and of parent–child and peer interactions, (4) greater attention to parental psychopathology which may confound associations noted, (5) exploration of other features of anxiety disorders (neurofunctional correlates, cognitive features, other aspects of emotional regulation) as potential precursors, and (6) intervention studies exploring whether modifying developmental antecedents can alter the course of anxiety disorders. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

This congenital disease is characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, relative macrocephaly, a typical triangular face, asymmetry, and further less constant characteristic features. Genetic and epigenetic disturbances can meanwhile be detected in approximately 50% of patients with typical RSS features. Up to 5% of patients carry a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD(7)mat), at least 44% show hypomethylation in the chromosome 11p15 imprinting center 1 (IC). In 1-2% of RSS patients, (sub)microscopic chromosomal aberrations can be observed. The diagnostic workup should therefore include methylation/genomic testing for chromosome 11p15, UPD(7)mat analysis and molecular karyotyping. The recurrence risk is generally low in RSS but it can be strongly increased in cases of familial epimutations or a chromosomal rearrangement. Interestingly, in approximately 7% of cases with chromosome 11p15 hypomethylation, hypomethylation of additional imprinted loci can be detected. Clinically, patients with hypomethylation at multiple loci do not differ from those with isolated 11p15 hypomethylation whereas the UPD(7)mat patients generally show a milder phenotype. Nevertheless, (epi)genotype-phenotype correlations are still evolving. Furthermore, the pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in the RSS phenotype still remain unknown despite the recent progress in deciphering the molecular defects associated with this condition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The urea cycle consists of six consecutive enzymatic reactions that convert waste nitrogen into urea. Urea cycle disorders are a group of inborn errors of hepatic metabolism that often result in life threatening hyperammonemia and hyperglutaminemia. Deficiencies of all of the enzymes of the cycle have been described and although each specific disorder results in the accumulation of different precursors, hyperammonemia and hyperglutaminemia are common biochemical hallmarks of these disorders. Arginase is the enzyme involved in the last step of the urea cycle. It catalyzes the conversion of arginine to urea and ornithine. The latter reenters the mitochondrion to continue the cycle. Hyperargininemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the arginase I enzyme. Unlike other urea cycle disorders, this condition is not generally associated with a hyperammonemic encephalopathy in the neonatal period. It typically presents later in childhood between 2 and 4 years of age with predominantly neurological features. If untreated, it progresses with gradual developmental regression. A favorable outcome can be achieved if dietary treatment and alternative pathway therapy are instituted early in the disease course. With this approach, further neurological deterioration is prevented and partial recovery of skills ensues. Early diagnosis of this disorder through newborn screening programs may lead to a better outcome. This review article summarizes the clinical characterization of this disorder; as well as its biochemical, enzymatic, and molecular features. Treatment, prenatal diagnosis and diagnosis through newborn screening are also discussed. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Weyers acrodental dysostosis (Weyers; OMIM 193530) is an allelic dominant disorder comprising polydactyly, nail dysplasia, and orofacial abnormalities. EvC results from loss‐of‐function mutations in EVC or EVC2 , the phenotype associated with the mutations in these two genes being indistinguishable. Three convincing causative mutations have been identified in patients with Weyers acrodental dysostosis, which are clustered in the last coding exon of EVC2 and lead to production of a truncated protein lacking the final 43 amino acids. Localization and function of EVC and EVC2 are inferred from studying the murine orthologs. Both Evc and Evc2 proteins localize to the basal bodies of primary cilia and analysis of an Ellis–van Creveld mouse model, which includes the limb shortening and tooth abnormalities of EvC patients, has demonstrated Hedgehog signaling defects in the absence of Evc. The loss of Evc2 has not been studied directly, but Hedgehog signaling is impaired when a mutant murine Evc2 Weyer variant is expressed in vitro. We conclude that the phenotypic abnormalities in EvC and Weyers syndrome result from tissue specific disruption of the response to Hh ligands. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bladder exstrophy (BE) is a complex congenital anomaly characterized by a defect in the closure of the lower abdominal wall and bladder. We aimed to provide an overview of the literature and conduct an epidemiologic study to describe the prevalence, and maternal and case characteristics of BE. We used data from 22 participating member programs of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR). All cases were reviewed and classified as isolated, syndrome, and multiple congenital anomalies. We estimated the total prevalence of BE and calculated the frequency and odds ratios for various maternal and case characteristics. A total of 546 cases with BE were identified among 26,355,094 births. The total prevalence of BE was 2.07 per 100,000 births (95% CI: 1.90–2.25) and varied between 0.52 and 4.63 among surveillance programs participating in the study. BE was nearly twice as common among male as among female cases. The proportion of isolated cases was 71%. Prevalence appeared to increase with increasing categories of maternal age, particularly among isolated cases. The total prevalence of BE showed some variations by geographical region, which is most likely attributable to differences in registration of cases. The higher total prevalence among male cases and older mothers, especially among isolated cases, warrants further attention. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Macroautophagy (often referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular system by which macromolecules and organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation and recycling. Autophagy is robustly induced in response to starvation in order to generate nutrients and energy through the lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic components. Constitutive, basal autophagy serves as a quality control mechanism for the elimination of aggregated proteins and worn‐out or damaged organelles, such as mitochondria. Research during the last decade has made it clear that malfunctioning or failure of this system is associated with a wide range of human pathologies and age‐related diseases. Our recent data provide strong evidence for the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of Pompe disease, a lysosomal glycogen storage disease caused by deficiency of acid alpha‐glucosidase (GAA). Large pools of autophagic debris in skeletal muscle cells can be seen in both our GAA knockout model and patients with Pompe disease. In this review, we will focus on these recent data, and comment on the not so recent observations pointing to the involvement of autophagy in skeletal muscle damage in Pompe disease. Published 2012.

The majority of this debate has been theoretical, with little empirical evidence published. We conducted in‐depth interviews with 18 young people who had undergone testing, to explore the range of harms and benefits that they perceived were associated with their tests. Participants were eight individuals who were tested for Huntington disease (two gene‐positive, six gene‐negative) and ten who were tested for familial adenomatous polyposis (five gene‐positive, five gene‐negative). At the time of their test they ranged from 10 to 25 years of age. When interviewed they ranged from 14 to 26 years of age. Harms described included knowledge of future illness, witnessing distress in parents, negative effects on family relationships and friendships, effects upon employment and school, experiencing regret, feeling guilty and having to confront difficult issues. Benefits included knowledge of gene‐negative status, relief from uncertainty, witnessing relief in parents, feeling able to plan for the future, positive effects on family relationships and friendships, feeling empowered and experiencing a sense of clarity about what is important in life. Harms were described in relation to gene‐negative test results, as were benefits in relation to gene‐positive test results. The testing process itself had several positive and negative effects for young people, distinct from the actual test result. Future research concerning the effects of predictive genetic testing in young people must remain broad and should aim to measure the beneficial as well as the harmful effects that resonate for young people themselves. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The stereotypic facial characteristics include prominent forehead, thin, highly arched eyebrows, depressed nasal bridge, full cheeks, deficient nasal alae and prominent columella, thin upper lip, and various minor anomalies of the pinnae. Abnormal nipples, including inverted nipples, have been reported in a number of cases. CNS, ocular, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, and other GU anomalies have been noted in nearly one‐third of patients. Of note, coarctation or hypoplasia of the aorta has been described in several affected children. Wilms tumor, renal dysplasia, and tracheomalacia have been reported only with the most proximal breakpoint at band 2q37.1 while a range of GI anomalies, pyloric stenosis, and diaphragmatic defects have been reported with breakpoints throughout the region. A subset of patients with the most distal deletion present phenotypic features which mimic Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). In addition to the AHO‐like phenotype, later onset findings include seizures and cystic kidneys. Timely diagnosis of this recognizable syndrome provides a basis for genetic counseling, appropriate surveillance, and intervention, and avoids unnecessary and expensive diagnostic testing. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

This change is effected by simultaneously rolling the top layer of the disc, the ectoderm, into the neural tube and the bottom layers of the disc, the endoderm and mesoderm, into the gut tube and body wall, respectively. In this manner, the flat disc is transformed into two tubes, one dorsal to the other, surrounded by supporting structures in the body wall. If closure of the neural tube fails, then neural tube defects (NTDs), such as anencephaly and spina bifida, occur; if closure of the ventral body wall fails, then ventral body wall defects, such as ectopia cordis, gastroschisis, and bladder and cloacal exstrophy, occur. Interestingly, no known closure defects have been described for the gut tube. Note, however, that all of the closure defects that do occur have their origins early in gestation during the third and fourth weeks of development. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Smith–Magenis syndrome (SMS; OMIM 182290) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a well‐defined pattern of anomalies. The majority of cases are due to a common deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 that includes the RAI1 gene. In children with SMS, autistic‐like behaviors and symptoms start to emerge around 18 months of age. This study included 26 individuals (15 females and 11 males), with a confirmed deletion (del 17p11.2). Parents/caregivers were asked to complete the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) both current and lifetime versions. The results suggest that 90% of the sample had SRS scores consistent with autism spectrum disorders. Moreover, females showed more impairment in total T‐scores ( P = 0.02), in the social cognition ( P = 0.01) and autistic mannerisms ( P = 0.002) subscales. The SCQ scores are consistent to show that a majority of individuals may meet criteria for autism spectrum disorders at some point in their lifetime. These results suggest that SMS needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders but also that therapeutic interventions for autism are likely to benefit individuals with SMS. The mechanisms by which the deletion of RAI1 and contiguous genes cause psychopathology remain unknown but they provide a solid starting point for further studies of gene–brain–behavior interactions in SMS and autism spectrum disorders.

    "abstract": "Abstract Creatine is a nitrogen containing compound that serves as an energy shuttle between the mitochondrial sites of ATP production and the cytosol where ATP is utilized. There are two known disorders of creatine synthesis (both transmitted as autosomal recessive traits: arginine: glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency; OMIM 602360; and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency (OMIM 601240)) and one disorder of creatine transport (X‐linked recessive SLC6A8 creatine transporter deficiency (OMIM 300036)). All these disorders are characterized by brain creatine deficiency, detectable by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Affected patients can have mental retardation, hypotonia, autism or behavioral problems and seizures. The diagnosis of these conditions relies on the measurement of plasma and urine creatine and guanidinoacetate. Creatine levels in plasma are reduced in both creatine synthesis defects and guanidinoacetate is increased in GAMT deficiency. The urine creatine/creatinine ratio is elevated in creatine transporter deficiency with normal plasma levels of creatine and guanidinoacetate. The diagnosis is confirmed in all cases by DNA testing or functional studies. Defects of creatine biosynthesis are treated with creatine supplements and, in GAMT deficiency, with ornithine and dietary restriction of arginine through limitation of protein intake. No causal therapy is yet available for creatine transporter deficiency and supplementation with the guanidinoacetate precursors arginine and glycine is being explored. The excellent response to therapy of early identified patients with GAMT or AGAT deficiency candidates these condition for inclusion in newborn screening programs. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

OFD1 is characterized by malformation of the oral cavity, face, and digits. Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities and cystic kidney disease can also be part of this condition. This disorder is due to mutations in the OFD1 gene that encodes a centrosomal protein localized at the basal bodies at the origin of primary cilia. Characterization of in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated that, similarly to what described for other ciliary proteins, Ofd1 inactivation is associated to defective sonic hedgehog (Shh) and canonical Wnt signaling pathways. Functional studies have demonstrated that OFD1 has a crucial role in the biology of primary cilia thus ascribing this pleiotropic disease to the growing number of disorders associated to dysfunction of primary cilia. OFD1 shares phenotypic similarities with this latter group of disorders, such as cystic kidneys, skeletal, and CNS abnormalities. Future studies will address whether all clinical manifestations of these diseases can be entirely explained by cilia dysfunction or may also be due to direct roles of the proteins involved. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The field of epigenetics--DNA modifications that can affect gene expression--offers new models to understand discordance in MZ twins. In the past, MZ twins were regarded as genetically-identical controls for differing environmental conditions. In contrast, the evolving current concept is that epigenetic differences between MZ twins may modulate differences in diverse phenotype, from disease to personality.

    "abstract": "Abstract Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process by which the male and the female germ line confer specific marks (imprints) onto certain gene regions, so that one allele of an imprinted gene is active and the other allele is silent. Genomic imprints are erased in primordial germ cells, newly established during later stages of germ cell development, and stably inherited through somatic cell divisions during postzygotic development. Defects in imprint erasure, establishment, or maintenance result in a paternal chromosome carrying a maternal imprint or in a maternal chromosome carrying a paternal imprint. A wrong imprint leads to activation of an allele that should be silent or silencing of an allele that should be active. Since the dosage of imprinted genes is very important for development and growth, imprinting defects lead to specific diseases. Imprinting defects can occur spontaneously without any DNA sequence change (primary imprinting defect) or as the result of a mutation in a cis ‐regulatory element or a trans ‐acting factor (secondary imprinting defect). The distinction between primary and secondary imprinting defects is important for assessing the recurrence risk in affected families. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The urea cycle consists of six consecutive enzymatic reactions that convert waste nitrogen into urea. Deficiencies of any of these enzymes of the cycle result in urea cycle disorders (UCD), a group of inborn errors of hepatic metabolism that often result in life threatening hyperammonemia. Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) is a cytosolic enzyme which catalyzes the fourth reaction in the cycle and the first degradative step, that is, the breakdown of argininosuccinic acid to arginine and fumarate. Deficiency of ASL results in an accumulation of argininosuccinic acid in tissues, and excretion of argininosuccinic acid in urine leading to the condition argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA). ASA is an autosomal recessive disorder and is the second most common UCD. In addition to the accumulation of argininosuccinic acid, ASL deficiency results in decreased synthesis of arginine, a feature common to all UCDs except argininemia. Arginine is not only the precursor for the synthesis of urea and ornithine as part of the urea cycle but it is also the substrate for the synthesis of nitric oxide, polyamines, proline, glutamate, creatine, and agmatine. Hence, while ASL is the only enzyme in the body able to generate arginine, at least four enzymes use arginine as substrate: arginine decarboxylase, arginase, nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) and arginine/glycine aminotransferase. In the liver, the main function of ASL is ureagenesis, and hence, there is no net synthesis of arginine. In contrast, in most other tissues, its role is to generate arginine that is designated for the specific cell's needs. While patients with ASA share the acute clinical phenotype of hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratory alkalosis common to other UCD, they also present with unique chronic complications most probably caused by a combination of tissue specific deficiency of arginine and/or elevation of argininosuccinic acid. This review article summarizes the clinical characterization, biochemical, enzymatic, and molecular features of this disorder. Current treatment, prenatal diagnosis, diagnosis through the newborn screening as well as hypothesis driven future treatment modalities are discussed. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common malformation of the embryonic forebrain in humans. Although HPE occurs along a continuous spectrum, it has been categorized into four types from most severe to least severe: alobar, semilobar, lobar, and middle interhemispheric (MIH) variant. Facial malformations are often associated with HPE and usually correlate with the severity of brain malformation. With the most severely affected newborns, there is a high mortality rate in the first month of life, however, with milder forms of HPE, the majority survive beyond infancy. The Carter Centers for Brain Research in Holoprosencephaly and Related Malformations have enrolled 182 living children in a prospective research study. Based on previously published reports using this database, reports from other investigators, as well as our experience and personal observations, the range of developmental, neurological, and medical problems found in children with HPE is described in this article. Virtually all children with HPE have some developmental disability and the severity correlates with the severity of the brain malformation on neuroimaging. Common medical problems include hydrocephalus, seizures, motor impairment, oromotor dysfunction with risk of poor nutrition and aspiration, chronic lung disease, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, hypothalamic dysfunction with disturbed sleep–wake cycles and temperature dysregulation, as well as endocrine dysfunction. Diabetes insipidus in particular is found in about 70% of children with classic HPE. Recommendations for management of these problems are given based on experiences of the authors and familiarity with the literature. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Simpson–Golabi–Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is a rare X‐linked multiple congenital abnormality/intellectual disability syndrome characterized by pre‐ and post‐natal overgrowth, distinctive craniofacial features, macrocephaly, variable congenital malformations, organomegaly, increased risk of tumor and mild/moderate intellectual deficiency. In 1996, Glypican 3 ( GPC3 ) was identified as the major gene causing SGBS but the mutation detection rate was only 28–70%, suggesting either genetic heterogeneity or that some patients could have alternative diagnoses. This was particularly suggested by some reports of atypical cases with more severe prognoses. In the family reported by Golabi and Rosen, a duplication of GPC4 was recently identified, suggesting that GPC4 could be the second gene for SGBS but no point mutations within GPC4 have yet been reported. In the genetics laboratory in Tours Hospital, GPC3 molecular testing over more than a decade has detected pathogenic mutations in only 8.7% of individuals with SGBS. In addition, GPC4 mutations have not been identified thus raising the question of frequent misdiagnosis. In order to better delineate the phenotypic spectrum of SGBS caused by GPC3 mutations, and to try to define specific clinical criteria for GPC3 molecular testing, we reviewed the clinical features of all male cases with a GPC3 mutation identified in the two molecular laboratories providing this test in France (Tours and Paris). We present here the results of the analysis of 42 patients belonging to 31 families and including five fetuses and three deceased neonates. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal involvement is a well known complication of Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDSs), mainly in form of abdominal emergencies due to intestinal/abdominal vessels rupture in vascular EDS. In the last decade, a growing number of works investigated the relationship between a wide spectrum of chronic gastrointestinal complaints and various EDS forms, among which the hypermobility type (a.k.a. joint hypermobility syndrome; JHS/EDS‐HT) was the most studied. The emerging findings depict a major role for gastrointestinal involvement in the health status and, consequently, management of JHS/EDS‐HT patients. Nevertheless, fragmentation of knowledge limits its impact on practice within the boundaries of highly specialized clinics. In this paper, literature review on gastrointestinal manifestations in JHS/EDS‐HT was carried out and identified papers categorized as (i) case‐control/cohort studies associating (apparently non‐syndromic) joint hypermobility and gastrointestinal involvement, (ii) case‐control/cohort studies associating JHS/EDS‐HT and gastrointestinal involvement, (iii) case reports/series on various gastrointestinal complications in (presumed) JHS/EDS‐HT, and (iv) studies reporting gastrointestinal features in heterogeneous EDS patients' cohorts. Gastrointestinal manifestations of JHS/EDS‐HT were organized and discussed in two categories, including structural anomalies (i.e., abdominal/diaphragmatic hernias, internal organ/pelvic prolapses, intestinal intussusceptions) and functional features (i.e., dysphagia, gastro‐esophageal reflux, dyspepsia, recurrent abdominal pain, constipation/diarrhea), with emphasis on practice and future implications. In the second part of this paper, a summary of possible nutritional interventions in JHS/EDS‐HT was presented. Supplementation strategies were borrowed from data available for general population with minor modifications in the light of recent discoveries in the pathogenesis of selected JHS/EDS‐HT features. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Scientific discovery and clinical management strategies for Disorders/Differences of Sex Development (DSD) have advanced in recent years. The 2006 Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders stated that a mental health component to care is integral to promote positive adaptation, yet the parameters of this element have not been described. The objective of this paper is threefold: to describe the psychosocial screening protocol adopted by the clinical centers of the DSD-Translational Research Network; to summarize psychosocial data collected at 1 of the 10 network sites; and to suggest how systematic behavioral health screenings can be employed to tailor care in DSD that results in better health and quality of life outcomes. Steps taken in developing the largely \"noncategorical\" screening protocol are described. These preliminary findings suggest that DSD, as one category of pediatric chronic conditions, is not associated with marked disturbances of psychosocial adaptation, either for the family or the child; however, screening frequently uncovered \"risk factors\" for individual families or patients that can potentially be addressed in the context of ongoing clinical care. Administration of the DSD-TRN psychosocial screening protocol was demonstrated to be feasible in the context of interdisciplinary team care and was acceptable to families on a longitudinal basis. The ultimate value of systematic screening will be demonstrated through a tailoring of psychosocial, medical and surgical services, based on this information that enhances the quality of patient and family-centered care and subsequent outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Evidence is now accumulating from a number of sequencing studies that ARID1B not only appears to be one of the most frequently mutated intellectual disability (ID) genes, but that the range of phenotypes caused by ARID1B mutations seems to be extremely wide. Thus, it is one of the most interesting ID genes identified so far in the exome sequencing era. In this article, we review the literature surrounding ARID1B and attempt to delineate the ARID1B phenotype. The vast majority of published ARID1B patients have been ascertained through studies of Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), which leads to bias when documenting the frequencies of phenotypic features. Additional observations of those individuals ascertained through exome sequencing studies helps in delineation of the broader clinical phenotype. We are currently establishing an ARID1B consortium, aimed at collecting ARID1B patients identified through genome-wide sequencing strategies. We hope that this endeavor will eventually lead to a more comprehensive view of the ARID1B phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dominant mutations in the TRPV4 gene result in a bone dysplasia family and form a continuous phenotypic spectrum that includes, in decreasing severity, lethal, and nonlethal metatropic dysplasia (MD), spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type (SMDK), and autosomal dominant brachyolmia. Several rare variant phenotypes that have some overlap but deviate in some ways from the general pattern have also been described. The known variant phenotypes are spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia Maroteaux type (Pseudo‐Morquio type 2), parastremmatic dysplasia, and familial digital arthropathy with brachydactyly. Interestingly, different TRPV4 mutations have been associated with dominantly inherited neurologic disorders such as congenital spinal muscular atrophy and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Finally, a small number of patients have been identified in whom a TRPV4 mutation results in a phenotype combining skeletal dysplasia with peripheral neuropathy. The TRPV4 gene encodes a regulated calcium channel implicated in multiple and diverse cellular processes. Over 50 different TRPV4 mutations have been reported, with two codons appearing to be mutational hot spots: P799 in exon 15, mostly associated with MD, and R594 in exon 11, associated with SMDK. While most pathogenic mutations tested so far result in activation of the calcium channel in vitro, the mechanisms through which TRPV4 activation results in skeletal dysplasia and/or peripheral neuropathy remain unclear and the genotype–phenotype correlations in this group of disorders remains somewhat mysterious. Since the phenotypic expression of most mutations seems to be relatively constant, careful clinical and radiographic assessment is useful in directing molecular analysis. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Previously, we showed that young boys with 47, XXY who received early hormonal therapy (EHT) had significantly improved neurodevelopment. The objective of this follow‐up study was to examine the effects of EHT on social behavior in boys with 47, XXY. The study consisted of boys prenatally diagnosed with 47, XXY who were referred for evaluations. Twenty‐nine boys received three injections of 25 mg testosterone enanthate and 57 controls did not receive EHT. Behavioral functioning was assessed using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Ed., and the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6–18. The hypothesis that EHT may affect behavior was formulated prior to data collection. Questionnaire data was prospectively obtained and analyzed to test for significance between two groups. Significant differences were identified between group's scores over time in Social Communication ( P = 0.007), Social Cognition ( P = 0.006), and Total T‐score ( P = 0.001) on the SRS‐2; Initiation ( P = 0.05) on the BRIEF; and Externalizing Problems ( P = 0.024), Affective Problems ( P = 0.05), and Aggressive Behaviors ( P = 0.031) on the CBCL. This is the third study revealing positive effects of EHT on boys with XXY. There was a significant improvements associated with the 47, XXY genotype in boys who received EHT.

    "abstract": "Abstract Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder marked by progressive muscle weakness due to lysosomal buildup of glycogen. Presentation is described as a spectrum, varying by age of onset, organ involvement, and degree of myopathy. Given the phenotypic variability, Pompe disease is broadly classified into an infantile form and a late onset (juvenile, childhood, adult onset) form. Prior to the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa and approval for human use in 2006, the natural history was limited due to death before age 2 years for infantile onset cases and significant morbidity and early mortality for late onset Pompe disease (LOPD). ERT with alglucosidase alfa redefined the once fatal outcome in infantile Pompe, establishing an emergent phenotype. Treatment in late onset patients resulted in improved outcomes, enhancing understanding of the phenotype, presentation, and extent of organ involvement. This Issue of the Seminars seeks to enumerate the recent advancements in the field of Pompe disease, including newborn screening, novel therapeutic targets, new insights in the pathophysiology including role of autophagy, and impacts of long‐term disease burden and CNS glycogen accumulation on cognition in infantile survivors. It also addresses immunological challenges and the critical role of immunomodulation in ERT treatment outcome. Other topics discussed include the role of biomarkers in monitoring disease progression and treatment responses, the role of genotype in defining phenotype and treatment response, better insights into the clinical presentations in LOPD and finally the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to care with the role of physical therapy as an example. Many gaps in our scientific understanding of this disease still remain; however, we hope the next decade will bring new knowledge and therapies to the horizon. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPRD) is a genetic, non‐inflammatory arthropathy caused by recessive loss of function mutations in WISP3 (Wnt1‐inducible signaling pathway protein 3; MIM 603400), encoding for a signaling protein. The disease is clinically silent at birth and in infancy. It manifests between the age of 3 and 6 years with joint pain and progressive joint stiffness. Affected children are referred to pediatric rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons; however, signs of inflammation are absent and anti‐inflammatory treatment is of little help. Bony enlargement at the interphalangeal joints progresses leading to camptodactyly. Spine involvement develops in late childhood and adolescence leading to short trunk with thoracolumbar kyphosis. Adult height is usually below the 3rd percentile. Radiographic signs are relatively mild. Platyspondyly develops in late childhood and can be the first clue to the diagnosis. Enlargement of the phalangeal metaphyses develops subtly and is usually recognizable by 10 years. The femoral heads are large and the acetabulum forms a distinct “lip” overriding the femoral head. There is a progressive narrowing of all articular spaces as articular cartilage is lost. Medical management of PPRD remains symptomatic and relies on pain medication. Hip joint replacement surgery in early adulthood is effective in reducing pain and maintaining mobility and can be recommended. Subsequent knee joint replacement is a further option. Mutation analysis of WISP3 allowed the confirmation of the diagnosis in 63 out of 64 typical cases in our series. Intronic mutations in WISP3 leading to splicing aberrations can be detected only in cDNA from fibroblasts and therefore a skin biopsy is indicated when genomic analysis fails to reveal mutations in individuals with otherwise typical signs and symptoms. In spite of the first symptoms appearing in early childhood, the diagnosis of PPRD is most often made only in the second decade and affected children often receive unnecessary anti‐inflammatory and immunosuppressive treatments. Increasing awareness of PPRD appears to be essential to allow for a timely diagnosis. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cardio‐facio‐cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a sporadic multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation condition principally caused by mutations in BRAF , MEK1 , and MEK2 . Mutations in KRAS and SHOC2 lead to a phenotype with overlapping features. In approximately 10–30% of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of CFC, a mutation in one of these causative genes is not found. Cardinal features of CFC include congenital heart defects, a characteristic facial appearance, and ectodermal abnormalities. Additional features include failure to thrive with severe feeding problems, moderate to severe intellectual disability and short stature with relative macrocephaly. First described in 1986, more than 100 affected individuals are reported. Following the discovery of the causative genes, more information has emerged on the breadth of clinical features. Little, however, has been published on genotype–phenotype correlations. This clinical study of 186 children and young adults with mutation‐proven CFC syndrome is the largest reported to date. BRAF mutations are documented in 140 individuals (∼75%), while 46 (∼25%) have a mutation in MEK 1 or MEK 2 . The age range is 6 months to 32 years, the oldest individual being a female from the original report [Reynolds et al. (1986); Am J Med Genet 25:413–427]. While some clinical data on 136 are in the literature, 50 are not previously published. We provide new details of the breadth of phenotype and discuss the frequency of particular features in each genotypic group.

Among these are classic disorders such as Angelman syndrome and MECP2 ‐related disorder (formerly Rett syndrome), as well as more recently described clinical entities associated with mutations in CASK , CDKL5 , CREBBP , and EP300 (Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome), FOXG1 , SLC9A6 (Christianson syndrome), and TCF4 (Pitt–Hopkins syndrome). These disorders can be identified clinically by phenotyping across multiple neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral realms, and enough data are available to recognize these postnatal microcephaly disorders as separate diagnostic entities in their own right. A second diagnostic grouping, comprised of Warburg MICRO syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, and Cerebral‐oculo‐facial skeletal syndrome, share similar features of somatic growth failure, ophthalmologic, and dysmorphologic features. Many postnatal microcephaly syndromes are caused by mutations in genes important in the regulation of gene expression in the developing forebrain and hindbrain, although important synaptic structural genes also play a role.

    "abstract": "Abstract The acromelic dysplasia group is characterized by short stature, short hands and feet, stiff joint, and “muscular” build. Four disorders can now be ascribed to this group, namely Weill–Marchesani syndrome (WMS), geleophysic dysplasia (GD), acromicric dysplasia (AD), and Myhre syndrome (MS). Although closely similar, they can be distinguished by subtle clinical features and their pattern inheritance. WMS is characterized by the presence of dislocation of microspherophakia and has autosomal dominant or recessive mode of inheritance. GD is the more severe one, with a progressive cardiac valvular thickening, tracheal stenosis, bronchopulmonary insufficiency, often leading to an early death. AD has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, distinct facial and skeleton features (a hoarse voice and internal notch of the femoral head). Finally, MS is sporadic, characterized by prognathism, deafness, developmental delay, thickened calvarium, and large vertebrae with short and large pedicles. We first identified mutations in Fibrillin‐1 ( FBN1 ) in the dominant form of WMS and then mutations in A Disintegrin‐like And Metalloproteinase domain with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats 10 ( ADAMTS10 ) in the recessive form of WMS. The function of ADAMTS10 is unknown but these findings support a direct interaction between ADAMTS10 and FBN1. We then identified mutations in ADAMTSL2 in the recessive form of GD and a hotspot of mutations in FBN1 in the dominant form of GD and in AD (exon 41–42, encoding TGFβ binding protein‐like domain 5 (TB5) of FBN1). The function of ADAMTSL2 is unknown. Using a yeast double hybrid screen, we identified latent transforming growth factor‐β (TGFβ) binding protein 1 as a partner of ADAMTSL2. We found an increased level of active TGFβ in the fibroblast medium from patients with FBN1 or ADAMTSL2 mutations and an enhanced phosphorylated SMAD2 level, allowing us to conclude at an enhanced TGFβ signaling in GD and AD. Finally, a direct interaction between ADAMTSL2 and FBN1 was demonstrated suggesting a dysregulation of FBN1/ADAMTSL2 interrelationship as the underlying mechanism of the short stature phenotypes. Using exome sequencing in MS probands, we identified de novo SMAD4 missense mutations, all involving isoleucine residue at position 500, in the MH2 domain. In MS fibroblasts, we found decreased ubiquitination level of SMAD4 and increased level of SMAD4 supporting a stabilization of SMAD4 protein. Functional SMAD4 is required for canonical signal transduction through the oligomerization with phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8. We therefore studied the nuclear localization of mutant SMAD complexes and found that the complexes translocate to the nucleus. We finally observed a decreased expression of downstream TGFβ target genes supporting impaired TGFβ driven transcriptional control in MS. Our findings support a direct link between the short stature phenotypes and the TGFβ signaling. However, the finding of enhanced TGFβ signaling in Marfan phenotypes supports the existence of yet unknown mechanisms regulating TGFβ action. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "In 1973, the Danish geneticist Petrea Jacobsen described a three‐generation family in which the proband carried a presumed terminal deletion at the end of the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q). This patient had dysmorphic features, congenital heart disease, and intellectual disability. Since Dr. Jacobsen's initial report, over 200 patients with Jacobsen syndrome have been reported, suggesting that Jacobsen syndrome is a contiguous gene disorder. With the advent of high resolution deletion mapping and the completion of the human genome sequencing project, a comprehensive genotype/phenotype analysis for Jacobsen syndrome became possible. In this article, we review research describing individual causal genes in distal 11q that contribute to the overall Jacobsen syndrome clinical phenotype. Through a combination of human genetics and the use of genetically engineered animal models, causal genes have been identified for the clinical problems in JS that historically have caused the greatest morbidity and mortality: congenital heart disease, the Paris–Trousseau bleeding disorder, intellectual disability, autism, and immunodeficiency. Insights gained from these studies are being applied for future drug development and clinical trials, as well as for a potential strategy for the prevention of certain forms of congenital heart disease. The results of these studies will likely not only improve the prognostic and therapeutic approaches for patients with Jacobsen syndrome, but also for the general population afflicted with these problems. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in ADNP were recently identified as a frequent cause of syndromic autism, characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive behavioral patterns. Based on its functional domains, ADNP is a presumed transcription factor. The gene interacts closely with the SWI/SNF complex by direct and experimentally verified binding of its C‐terminus to three of its core components. A detailed and systematic clinical assessment of the symptoms observed in our patients allows a detailed comparison with the symptoms observed in other SWI/SNF disorders. While the mutational mechanism of the first 10 patients identified suggested a gain of function mechanism, an 11th patient reported here is predicted haploinsufficient. The latter observation may raise hope for therapy, as addition of NAP, a neuroprotective octapeptide named after the first three amino acids of the sequence NAPVSPIQ, has been reported by others to ameliorate some of the cognitive abnormalities observed in a knockout mouse model. It is concluded that detailed clinical and molecular studies on larger cohorts of patients are necessary to establish a better insight in the genotype phenotype correlation and in the mutational mechanism. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Psychological distress is a known feature of generalized joint hypermobility (gJHM), as well as of its most common syndromic presentation, namely Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type (a.k.a. joint hypermobility syndrome — JHS/EDS‐HT), and significantly contributes to the quality of life of affected individuals. Most published articles dealt with the link between gJHM (or JHS/EDS‐HT) and anxiety‐related conditions, and a novel generation of studies is emerging aimed at investigating the psychopathologic background of such an association. In this paper, literature review was carried out with a semi‐systematic approach spanning the entire spectrum of psychopathological findings in gJHM and JHS/EDS‐HT. Interestingly, in addition to the confirmation of a tight link between anxiety and gJHM, preliminary connections with depression, attention deficit (and hyperactivity) disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder were also found. Few papers investigated the relationship with schizophrenia with contrasting results. The mind–body connections hypothesized on the basis of available data were discussed with focus on somatotype, presumed psychopathology, and involvement of the extracellular matrix in the central nervous system. The hypothesis of positive Beighton score and alteration of interoceptive/proprioceptive/body awareness as possible endophenotypes in families with symptomatic gJHM or JHS/EDS‐HT is also suggested. Concluding remarks addressed the implications of the psychopathological features of gJHM and JHS/EDS‐HT in clinical practice. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract NSD1 and EZH2 are SET domain‐containing histone methyltransferases that play key roles in the regulation of transcription through histone modification and chromatin modeling: NSD1 preferentially methylates lysine residue 36 of histone 3 (H3K36) and is primarily associated with active transcription, while EZH2 shows specificity for lysine residue 27 (H3K27) and is associated with transcriptional repression. Somatic dysregulation of NSD1 and EZH2 have been associated with tumorigenesis. NSD1 , as a fusion transcript with NUP98 , plays a key role in leukemogenesis, particularly childhood acute myeloid leukemia. EZH2 is a major proto‐oncogene and mono‐ and biallelic activating and inactivating somatic mutations occur as early events in the development of tumors, particularly poor prognosis hematopoietic malignancies. Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap. NSD1 mutations that cause Sotos syndrome are loss‐of‐function, primarily truncating mutations or missense mutations at key residues in functional domains. EZH2 mutations that cause Weaver syndrome are primarily missense variants and the rare truncating mutations reported to date are in the last exon, suggesting that simple haploinsufficiency is unlikely to be generating the overgrowth phenotype although the exact mechanism has not yet been determined. Many additional questions about the molecular and clinical features of NSD1 and EZH2 remain unanswered. However, studies are underway to address these and, as more cases are ascertained and technology improves, it is hoped that these will, in time, be answered. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Delays in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment contribute to a high risk of neurocognitive impairment. HI represents a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by dysregulated insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cells, which in utero, may result in somatic overgrowth. There are at least nine known monogenic forms of HI as well as several syndromic forms. Molecular diagnosis allows for prediction of responsiveness to medical treatment and likelihood of surgically‐curable focal hyperinsulinism. Timely genetic mutation analysis has thus become standard of care. However, despite significant advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of this disorder, the number of patients without an identified genetic diagnosis remains high, suggesting that there are likely additional genetic loci that have yet to be discovered.",

DSD are congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical. Facilities providing care for patients with DSD were targeted for participation. Specialty providers completed a survey with questions in six broad categories: Institution Information, Nomenclature and Care Guidelines, Interdisciplinary Services, Staff and Community Education, DSD Management, and Research. Twenty-two of 36 targeted sites (61%) participated. Differences were observed between sites with regard to what conditions were considered to be DSD. All sites reported some degree of involvement of pediatric urology and/or surgery and pediatric endocrinology in the care of DSD patients. Gynecology and neonatology were most frequently not represented. Wide variation was observed across sites in continuing education standards, obtaining informed consent for clinical procedures, and in specific clinical management practices. This survey is the first to assess DSD clinical management practices in the United States. The findings establish a baseline of current practices against which providers delivering care to these patients and their families can benchmark their efforts. Such surveys also provide a practical framework for collaboration in identifying opportunities for change that enhance health and quality of life outcomes for patients and families affected by DSD.",

For the annotation process, 17 experts in AMC representing 10 disciplines across 7 countries participated. A paragraph was developed for each sentence of the definition using an iterative process involving multiple authors with varied and complementary expertise, ensuring all points of view were taken into consideration.

We analyzed 61 molecularly confirmed cases, including all previously reported patients (n = 47) and 14 additional unpublished individuals. NCBRS is clinically and genetically homogeneous. The cardinal features (ID, short stature, microcephaly, typical face, sparse hair, brachydactyly, prominent interphalangeal joints, behavioral problems and seizures), are almost universally present. There is variability however, as ID can range from severe to mild, and sparse hair may be present only in certain age groups. There may be a correlation between the severity of the ID and presence of seizures, absent speech, short stature and microcephaly. SMARCA2 mutations causing NCBRS are likely to act through a dominant‐negative effect. There may be some genotype–phenotype correlations (mutations at domain VI with severe ID and seizures; mutations affecting residues Pro883, Leu946, and Ala1201 with mild phenotypes) but numbers are still too small to draw definitive conclusions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The detection rate of a pathogenic variant in the CHD7 gene varies from 67% to 90%.

Not all X‐linked genes are completely inactivated, however, with 12% of genes escaping X chromosome inactivation and another 15% of genes varying in their X chromosome inactivation status across individuals, tissues or cells. Expression of these genes from the second and otherwise inactive X chromosome may underlie sex differences between males and females, and feature in many of the symptoms of XXY Klinefelter males, who have both an inactive X and a Y chromosome. We review the approaches used to identify genes that escape from X‐chromosome inactivation and discuss the nature of their sex‐biased expression. These genes are enriched on the short arm of the X chromosome, and, in addition to genes in the pseudoautosomal regions, include genes with and without Y‐chromosomal counterparts. We highlight candidate escape genes for some of the features of Klinefelter syndrome and discuss our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying silencing and escape on the X chromosome as well as additional differences between the X in males and females that may contribute to Klinefelter syndrome.",

CPM may also be a marker for uniparental disomy. Given that NIPT can result in false positives, positive results should be confirmed with invasive testing before any irreversible procedure is performed. Whether to perform CVS or amniocentesis to confirm a positive NIPT result is controversial. While CVS can be performed earlier than amniocentesis, CPM can also cause false positive results. Our practice is to proceed with CVS, and to examine all cell lines using both an uncultured sample using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or short-term culture, as well as long-term culture of the sample. If the results all show aneuploidy, the results are reported to the patient. Otherwise, if the results are also mosaic, amniocentesis is recommended and analyzed by both FISH and karyotype. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Differences of Sex Development (DSD) includes a wide spectrum of etiologies and phenotypes. A subset of individuals with DSDs are predisposed to gonadal germ cell tumor (GCT). In this setting, GCT risk varies widely, depending on the DSD molecular etiology and penetrance. Prognostication based on molecular diagnosis remains challenging, as natural history data specific to recently identified molecular causes of DSD is lacking. In this review, we provide a framework for the clinical geneticist to consider GCT tumor risk in the patient with DSD. We discuss germ cell development and etiology of GCT growth, along with parameters to consider when recommending prophylactic gonadectomy including fertility, hormonal output, and malignant GTC treatment outcomes. Shortly after the 2006 reorganization of DSD nomenclature, literature reviews of natural history publications stratified GCT risk by a chromosomal, pathological, and hormonal taxonomy. Our 2017 literature review reveals a larger body of publications. However, the broad DSD GCT risk stratification within the 2006 taxonomy remains stable. We discuss precise GCT risk assessment for specific diagnoses, including androgen insensitivity, Smith-Lemli-Opitz, and 46,XY with MAP3K1 mutations and gonadal dysgenesis, as examples. We also examine the GCT risk in non-DSD syndromes, in addition to the cancer risks in DSD patients with dimorphic gonads and genitalia. This review is intended to provide a nuanced assessment of relative germ cell tumor risk in the DSD patient, including modern precise molecular diagnosis, for use by the clinical geneticist.",

In this special issue of the American Journal of Medical Genetics part C , authors of eleven manuscripts describe specific organ system features of CHARGE syndrome, with a focus on recent developments in diagnosis, etiologies, and treatments. Since 2004, when CHD7 was identified as the major causative gene in CHARGE, several animal models (mice, zebrafish, flies, and frog) and cell‐based systems have been developed to explore the underlying pathophysiology of this condition. In this article, we summarize those advances, highlight opportunities for new discoveries, and encourage readers to explore specific organ systems in more detail in each individual article. We hope the excitement around innovative research and development in CHARGE syndrome will encourage others to join this effort, and will stimulate other investigators and professionals to engage with individuals diagnosed as having CHARGE syndrome, their families, and their care providers.",

    "abstract": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility, low bone mass, and bone deformities. The majority of cases are caused by autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes that encode type I collagen, the major component of the bone matrix. The remaining cases are caused by autosomal recessively or dominantly inherited mutations in genes that are involved in the post‐translational modification of type I collagen, act as type I collagen chaperones, or are members of the signaling pathways that regulate bone homeostasis. The main goals of treatment in OI are to decrease fracture incidence, relieve bone pain, and promote mobility and growth. This requires a multi‐disciplinary approach, utilizing pharmacological interventions, physical therapy, orthopedic surgery, and monitoring nutrition with appropriate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Bisphosphonate therapy, which has become the mainstay of treatment in OI, has proven beneficial in increasing bone mass, and to some extent reducing fracture risk. However, the response to treatment is not as robust as is seen in osteoporosis, and it seems less effective in certain types of OI, and in adult OI patients as compared to most pediatric cases. New pharmacological treatments are currently being developed, including anti‐resorptive agents, anabolic treatment, and gene‐ and cell‐therapy approaches. These therapies are under different stages of investigation from the bench‐side, to pre‐clinical and clinical trials. In this review, we will summarize the recent findings regarding the pharmacological and biological strategies for the treatment of patients with OI. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Turner syndrome (TS) and the genotype–phenotype relationship has been thoroughly investigated during the last decade. It has become evident that the phenotype seen in TS does not only depend on simple gene dosage as a result of X chromosome monosomy. The origin of TS specific comorbidities such as infertility, cardiac malformations, bone dysgenesis, and autoimmune diseases may depend on a complex relationship between genes as well as transcriptional and epigenetic factors affecting gene expression across the genome. Furthermore, two individuals with TS with the exact same karyotype may exhibit completely different traits, suggesting that no conventional genotype–phenotype relationship exists. Here, we review the different genetic mechanisms behind differential gene expression, and highlight potential key‐genes essential to the comorbidities seen in TS and other X chromosome aneuploidy syndromes. KDM6A , important for germ cell development, has shown to be differentially expressed and methylated in Turner and Klinefelter syndrome across studies. Furthermore, TIMP1 / TIMP3 genes seem to affect the prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve. KDM5C could play a role in the neurocognitive development of Turner and Klinefelter syndrome. However, further research is needed to elucidate the genetic mechanism behind the phenotypic variability and the different phenotypic traits seen in TS.",

Clinicians may dismiss subjective symptoms of chronic pain, thus prolonging patients' odysseys and worsening their care and satisfaction and creating antagonisms in the patient-provider relationship. A greater understanding of patient experiences is necessary in order to decrease burdens of this relationship and to improve care. To that end, we conducted 22 in-depth, semistructured interviews with individuals who had undergone this diagnostic odyssey. We focused on the impact that the odyssey had on their lives, both inside and outside the clinic. Through narrative analysis, we found a sort of \"hero's journey\" in the description of their cases, highlighting issues of uncertainty and integration as well as honoring their struggles. Interviewees had encountered difficulties in working with clinicians, in multiplying symptoms, and in negative psychosocial consequences. Attention to patients' lived experience may help to build empathy and understanding for the difficult and complex clinical situation presented by Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Using the hero's journey as a lens onto this experience allows for a more patient-centered approach to this understanding and has potential value for comprehension of other complex diseases and invisible illnesses.",

Phenotype-driven early genetic diagnosis of fetal genetic disease can help to strategize treatment options and clinical preventive measures during the perinatal period, to plan in utero therapies, and to inform parental decision-making. Fetal phenotypes of genetic diseases are often unique and at present are not well understood; more comprehensive knowledge about prenatal phenotypes and computational resources have an enormous potential to improve diagnostics and translational research. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has been widely used to support diagnostics and translational research in human genetics. To better support prenatal usage, the HPO consortium conducted a series of workshops with a group of domain experts in a variety of medical specialties, diagnostic techniques, as well as diseases and phenotypes related to prenatal medicine, including perinatal pathology, musculoskeletal anomalies, neurology, medical genetics, hydrops fetalis, craniofacial malformations, cardiology, neonatal-perinatal medicine, fetal medicine, placental pathology, prenatal imaging, and bioinformatics. We expanded the representation of prenatal phenotypes in HPO by adding 95 new phenotype terms under the Abnormality of prenatal development or birth (HP:0001197) grouping term, and revised definitions, synonyms, and disease annotations for most of the 152 terms that existed before the beginning of this effort. The expansion of prenatal phenotypes in HPO will support phenotype-driven prenatal exome and genome sequencing for precision genetic diagnostics of rare diseases to support prenatal care.",

It is characterized by the dominant deposition of the third component of complement (C3) in the renal glomerulus as resolved by immunofluorescence microscopy. The underlying pathophysiology is driven by dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement in the fluid‐phase and in the glomerular microenvironment. Characterization of clinical features and a targeted evaluation for indices and drivers of complement dysregulation are necessary for optimal patient care. Autoantibodies to the C3 and C5 convertases of complement are the most commonly detected drivers of complement dysregulation, although genetic mutations in complement genes can also be found. Approximately half of patients progress to end‐stage renal disease within 10 years of diagnosis, and, while transplantation is a viable option, there is high risk for disease recurrence and allograft failure. This poor outcome reflects the lack of disease‐specific therapy for C3G, relegating patients to symptomatic treatment to minimize proteinuria and suppress renal inflammation. Fortunately, the future is bright as several anti‐complement drugs are currently in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this study, we propose a definition of targeted therapy and use GeneReviews , a peer‐reviewed, online point‐of‐care resource for primarily constitutional (or rare congenital mosaic) genetic conditions, to compile a list of primarily heritable genetic disorders for which such targeted therapy is available. This study aims to give a high‐level view of the types of targeted therapies and the proportion of congenital genetic disorders for which a targeted therapy is available. We propose that a targeted therapy is one that addresses the underlying molecular mechanism of the disorder and/or can alter the disease course (including by providing a cure in some instances) but may not be an obvious treatment option without knowledge of the patient's underlying genetic condition. For the purposes of this study, a treatment meeting one or both of these criteria was categorized as targeted. This means that the clinician might not consider the specific treatment option unless the patient was known to have the genetic diagnosis. This definition does not include therapies based on symptoms alone, which does not rely on the clinician being aware of a patient's genetic diagnosis. As most of the congenital genetic conditions in this study are rare and often diagnosed in a pediatric age group, determining efficacy for the specific use of most of the targeted therapies is not possible, although any drug or medication in the Management section of GeneReviews is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with rare exceptions for drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of the European Union (EU) but not yet FDA approved. Of 790 GeneReviews chapters on primarily constitutional genetic conditions included in this study, 176 chapters representing over 255 genes meet the definition of having a targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "When a patient refuses to inform relatives of their risk for genetic disease, the genetic healthcare professional is faced with conflicting ethical obligations. On one side of the issue is the obligation to respect and protect patients' right to privacy. On the other side is the obligation to prevent harm and promote the welfare of the family members, which suggests a responsibility to warn at-risk relatives, even without the patient's consent. In an effort to examine the actual clinical impact of this issue, we conducted a pilot study that explored genetic counselors' experience with this conflict. A survey was developed and made available to members of the National Society of Genetic Counselors. Questions were either multiple-choice responses or open-ended. Almost half of respondents (119/259; 46%) had had a patient refuse to notify an at-risk relative. The most commonly cited reasons for refusal were estranged family relationships, altering family dynamics, insurance discrimination, and employment discrimination, respectively. Of these 119 counselors, 24 (21%) reported that they seriously considered warning the at-risk relatives without patient consent, and one actually did disclose. Three factors consistently made the counselors less likely to disclose: their patient's potential emotional reaction, the relationship between the relative and patient, and the chance that the relative could be aware of the disease by another means. These results suggest that while the conflict is often encountered in clinical practice, it is rare that the situation remains unresolved to the extent that genetic counselors actually consider warning at-risk relatives. However, when the situation was encountered, the counselors in this study reported a lower rate of disclosure without consent than would have been anticipated based on previous studies that used hypothetical situations. It may be that counselors do not recognize a duty to warn at-risk relatives as integral to their role and professional obligations.",

The third sample is of women from South Africa, each of whom has given birth to a child diagnosed with full fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Data across samples conform to expected trends on many variables. For example, the maternal age at time of pregnancy, a major risk factor for FAS, ranged from a mean of 23.5 years for the prenatal clinic sample, to 23.8 years for the developmental clinic sample, to 27.6 for the sample of women who have delivered children with FAS. Other variables of maternal risk for FAS expected from the extant literature, such as high gravidity and parity, binge drinking, heavy intergenerational drinking in the mother's extended family and immediate social network, and length of drinking career, were compared across the three samples with variable results. However, normative measures of drinking problems are unreliable when reported across cultures. An unexpected finding from this three‐sample comparison was the differential risk found when comparing U.S. women to South African women. Women in the U.S. Plains Indian samples report a high consumption of alcohol in a binge pattern of drinking, yet there is less detectable damage to the fetus than among the South African women. Body mass index (BMI) and lifelong and current nutrition may have a substantial impact, along with the above factors, in relative risk for an FAS birth. The level of risk for producing a child with FAS is influenced by environmental and behavioral conditions that vary between populations and among individual women. Also, because many syndromes are genetically based, there is a need for full behavioral and genetic histories of the mother, family, and child being studied. Collecting extensive behavioral information as well as genetic histories will provide the requisite information for making an accurate diagnosis of FAS. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The Old Order Mennonites of southeastern Pennsylvania are a religious isolate with origins in 16th-century Switzerland. The Swiss Mennonites immigrated to Pennsylvania over a 50-year period in the early 18th century. The history of this population in the United States provides insight into the increased incidence of several genetic diseases, most notably maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), and congenital nephrotic syndrome. A comparison between the Old Order Mennonites and the Old Order Amish demonstrates the unique genetic heritage of each group despite a common religious and geographic history. Unexpectedly, several diseases in both groups demonstrate allelic and/or locus heterogeneity. The population genetics of the 1312T --> A BCKDHA gene mutation, which causes classical MSUD, are presented in detail. The incidence of MSUD in the Old Order Mennonites is estimated to be 1/358 births, yielding a corrected carrier frequency of 7.96% and a mutation allele frequency of 4.15%. Analysis of the population demonstrates that repeated cycles of sampling effects, population bottlenecks, and subsequent genetic drift were important in shaping the current allele frequencies. A linkage disequilibrium analysis of 1312T --> A mutation haplotypes is provided and discussed in the context of the known genealogical history of the population. Finally, data from microsatellite marker genotyping within the Old Order Mennonite population are provided that show a significant but modest decrease in genetic diversity and elevated levels of background linkage disequilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tenascin‐X is an extracellular matrix protein initially identified because the gene encoding it overlaps with the human CYP21B gene. Because studies of gene and protein function of other tenascins had been poorly predictive of essential functions in vivo, we used a genetic approach that critically relied on an understanding of the genomic locus to uncover an association between inactivating tenascin‐X mutations and novel recessive and dominant forms of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS). Tenascin‐X provides the first example of a gene outside of the fibrillar collagens and their processing enzymes that causes EDS. Tenascin‐X null mice recapitulate the skin findings of the human disease, confirming a causative role for this gene in EDS. Further evaluation of these mice showed that tenascin‐X is an important regulator of collagen deposition in vivo, suggesting a novel mechanism of disease in this form of EDS. Further studies suggest that tenascin‐X may do this through both direct and indirect interactions with the collagen fibril. Recent studies show that TNX effects on matrix extend beyond the collagen to the elastogenic pathway and matrix remodeling enzymes. Tenascin‐X serves as a compelling example of how human “experiments of nature” can guide us to an understanding of genes whose function may not be evident from their sequence or in vitro studies of their encoded proteins. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Over a 14-year period, 1988-2002, we have encountered 39 heritable disorders among the Amish and 23 among the Mennonites. We emphasize early recognition and long-term medical care of children with genetic conditions. In the clinic laboratory we perform amino acid analyses by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), organic acid analyses by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and molecular diagnoses and carrier tests by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing or restriction digestion. Regional hospitals and midwives routinely send whole-blood filter paper neonatal screens for tandem mass spectrometry and other modern analytical methods to detect 14 of the metabolic disorders found in these populations as part of the NeoGen Inc. Supplemental Newborn Screening Program (Pittsburgh, PA). Medical care based on disease pathophysiology reduces morbidity, mortality, and costs for the majority of disorders. Among our patients who are homozygous for the same mutation, differences in disease severity are not unusual. Clinical problems typically arise from the interaction of the underlying genetic disorder with common infections, malnutrition, injuries, and immune dysfunction that act through classical pathophysiological disease mechanisms to influence the natural history of disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The basis of suicidal behavior (SB) is complex and multifactorial. Numerous risk factors have been identified. Epidemiological genetics studies (family studies, twin studies, adoption studies) suggest that there is a genetic basis to SB and that this genetic basis is specific and independent from the genetic factors implicated in predisposition to psychiatric disorders associated with SB (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcoholism). Recently, new molecular genetics tools have been designed to identify the genetic factors that predispose certain individuals to disorders of complex etiology. Biological psychiatry studies have suggested that the physiopathology of SB involves dysfunctioning of the serotonin system. The first genetic association studies tested candidate genes encoding proteins involved in serotonin metabolism. The results of these studies suggest that the gene coding for the limiting enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), and the gene encoding the serotonin transporter are involved in predisposition to SB. Furthermore, it is likely that these genes interact with each other and with environmental factors (early) and that they have different phenotypic consequences. One of the main aims of studies currently underway is to identify the precise phenotypes associated with genes that predispose to SB or intermediate phenotypes (impulsivity, inability to control anger, etc.). © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable disorder of connective tissue that is characterized by skin hyperextensibility, fragile and soft skin, delayed wound healing with formation of atrophic scars, easy bruising, and generalized joint hypermobility. Mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the alpha1 and the alpha2-chain of type V collagen respectively, are identified in approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic EDS. In approximately one third of patients, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a non-functional COL5A1 allele, and resulting in haplo-insufficiency of type V collagen. In a smaller proportion of patients, a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, resulting in the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein, is responsible for the phenotype. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations can be made so far. The relatively low mutation detection rate in the COL5A1/A2 genes suggests genetic heterogeneity. Indeed rarely mutations in type I collagen have been identified in patients with classic EDS. Mutations in the gene for tenascin-X have been implicated in an autosomal recessive condition phenotypically overlapping with classic EDS. Several other candidate genes, such as decorin, have emerged from the study of transgenic mouse models with clinical and ultrastructural features reminiscent of classic EDS. However, to date, no human examples have been reported for these mouse models.",

    "abstract": "A genetic contribution to the risk of suicidal behavior is now supported by many studies. It probably involves specific factors acting on their own, independently of the genetic transmission of associated psychiatric disorders. A history of childhood maltreatment, adverse events, psychosocial stress, psychological traits and major psychiatric disorders all appear to contribute to the global risk of suicide attempt or completion. The interplay between previously identified risk factors, different as they are in nature and degree of complexity, still remains to be clarified. A stress-diathesis model has been proposed, where trait-like genetic and developmental risk factors (the diathesis) interact through still unknown mechanisms with actual (stress-related) factors to create the conditions for a suicidal gesture. Disentangling the effects of these risk factors, and specifically the effects of the genetic factors influencing these different pathological conditions, appears to be a difficult task. Indeed the results of candidate gene association studies suggest that genetic vulnerability factors for various related psychiatric phenotypes (major psychiatric disorders and personality traits) partly overlap with more specific factors predisposing to suicidal behavior. Personality traits are partly under genetic control and may be closer to the genetic effects than psychiatric syndromes. We review here the available data on the genetics of personality traits presumably involved in suicidal behavior, focusing on the association studies carried out with serotonin-related genes. We suggest that future studies on the genetic vulnerability to suicidal behavior should include the investigation of endophenotypes, with the aim of deciphering the mechanisms underlying the genetic susceptibility to these closely associated phenotypes.",

In a survey of 80 studies on 38 candidate genes, few found significant results in human populations through case-control or family-based association studies. While the folate pathway has been explored extensively, only the MTHFR 677C > T polymorphism was significant, and only in an Irish population. Developmental pathways such as the Wnt signaling pathway and Hox genes have also been explored without positive results. More than 90 mouse candidates have been identified through spontaneous and knockout mutations, but only the T locus (mouse Brachyury gene) showed association in an initial study that was not confirmed on follow-up. Positional candidates have been derived from cytogenetic evidence, but preliminary genomic screens have limited power due to small sample sizes. Future studies would increase their power to detect association by using more samples. In addition a clarification of the phenotype would be beneficial as many studies used different inclusion criteria. Incorporating several types of data could highlight better candidates, as would looking beyond the traditional sources for candidate genes. Recent studies of an energy metabolism gene (UCP2) and vitamin B metabolism (Transcoalbumin) have produced promising results. Utilizing other model organisms may also be beneficial, as in a recent study from a chick model of NTDs in NCAM1. New approaches combined with traditional methods and increased sample sizes will help prioritize human NTD candidate genes and clarify the complex etiology of this condition.",

The prevalence of this disorder is unknown, but it is likely under‐diagnosed. Age at diagnosis has varied widely, from cases diagnosed prenatally to 46 years. Males and females are equally affected. The distal 22q deletion can be detected occasionally by routine or high resolution chromosome analysis; however, the majority of cases are detected by FISH analysis, associated with deletion of the ARSA (control) probe when performing a FISH analysis for the velocardiofacial syndrome (del 22q11.2). The 22q13.3 deletion syndrome can accompany a simple chromosome deletion, an unbalanced translocation, or a ring chromosome. Primary care physicians, in addition to numerous specialists, play an important role in caring for patients with this disorder. Although the dysmorphic features observed in this condition are nonspecific, it is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of children with developmental delay, hypotonia, marked speech and language disability, autistic‐like features, multiple minor anomalies, and normal growth and head circumference. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Previous examinations of this topic often included patients with genetic syndromes. To correct this potential bias, we undertook an extensive review of the literature and obtained new data. The frequency of CVMs associated with isolated CDH was 11–15%. A careful analysis of CVMs indicates that atrial and ventricular septal defects, conotruncal defects, and left ventricular outflow tract obstructive defects were the most common type of CVMs, but proportional to the frequency of occurrence in the general population. The combination of CVM and CDH results in a poorer prognosis than would be expected with either malformation alone. However, the impact on survival from patients with a genetic syndrome has not been consistently evaluated. We encourage researchers to re‐analyze existing series and recommend that future studies distinguish isolated CDH from that which is associated with other malformations, especially as part of genetic syndromes. Therapies should be tailored to maximize cardiac output and systemic oxygen delivery rather than systemic oxygen saturation alone. Although there is speculation about the frequency with which isolated left ventricular “hypoplasia” occurs in patients with CDH, we suggest it results from compression of a pre‐load deficient left ventricle by the hypertensive right ventricle, and unlike true hypoplasia, is reversible. Irrespective of the type of severity of CVMs in patients with CDH, the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary vascular disease predicts outcome. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

There are about 50 reported cases worldwide. Affected individuals invariably have severe hypotonia with speech and gross motor delay. The facial gestalt is distinct and features absolute or relative micro‐ or brachycephaly, hypertelorism, synophrys, and/or arched eyebrows, mid‐face hypoplasia, a short nose with upturned nares, a protruding tongue with everted lower lip and down‐turned corners of the mouth. Approximately half of affected individuals have congenital heart defects (primarily ASD or VSD). A significant minority have epilepsy and/or behavioral and sleep disturbances. A variety of other major and minor eye, ear, genital, and limb anomalies have been reported. Most patients have sub‐microscopic deletions of the subtelomere region of chromosome 9q34.3 that range from &lt;400 kb to &gt;3 Mb. The 9qSTDS is caused by haplo‐insufficiency of EHMT1, a gene whose protein product (Eu‐HMTase1) is a histone H3 Lys 9 (H3‐K9) methyltransferase. This was established by identification of three patients with features of the syndrome and either mutations or a balanced translocation in EHMT1 . H3‐K9 histone methylation is restricted to the euchromatin of mammals and functions to silence individual genes. Deletion size does not correlate with the severity of the 9qSTDS since patients with mutations in EHMT1 are as severely affected as those with submicroscopic deletions. Patients clinically suspected of having the 9qSTDS but with normal subtelomere deletion testing by FISH or MLPA should be considered for detailed 9q MLPA analysis and/or sequencing of EHMT1 . EHMT1 is another example in the growing list of genes responsible for brain development that appear to play a role in chromatin remodeling. Published 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Chronic, persistent anxiety within the period 5 years after their initial diagnosis was shown by 62.2% of those with an anxiety diagnosis (51.1% of the entire sample). The most common diagnoses were specific phobias and generalized anxiety disorder. Multilevel logistic regression models were estimated for the presence of any anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and specific phobia of loud noises. Developmental trajectories, expressed as the probability of a positive diagnosis, suggested that the odds of a positive diagnosis did not change with age. IQ was not significantly related to the presence of an anxiety disorder. However, there was a significant relation between executive functioning and anxiety such that the presence of an anxiety diagnosis was associated with increased scores on behavioral regulation, indicative of increased difficulty with inhibitory control of affect and behavior. These findings are discussed in terms of persistence of anxiety over time and the need to develop and test interventions to address the high levels of anxiety experienced by children and adolescents with WS. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Williams–Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a multi‐system disorder that requires ongoing management by a primary care physician familiar with the natural history and common medical problems associated with the condition. Some abnormalities are unique to WBS, such as the elastin arteriopathy that often manifests as supravalvar aortic stenosis and hypertension. Still other features, such as diverticulosis, are seen in the general population but tend to present earlier in WBS. Life long monitoring of the cardiovascular and endocrine systems is essential to the clinical management of individuals with Williams–Beuren syndrome. Constipation should be aggressively managed, and symptoms of abdominal pain should prompt an evaluation for diverticulosis/diverticulitis. While the mean IQ of WBS is in the mild mental retardation range, difficulties with attention and anxiety are more likely to negatively impact independent functioning in the adult with WBS. There is no evidence for decline in cognitive ability over time, but adaptive functioning may be improved with treatment of anxiety by both behavior and medical modalities. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Children with infantile Pompe disease are surviving beyond infancy, some achieving independent walking and functional levels never before possible. Individuals with late‐onset Pompe disease are experiencing motor and respiratory improvement and/or stabilization with slower progression of impairments. A new phenotype is emerging for those with infantile Pompe disease treated with ERT. This new phenotype appears to be distinct from the late‐onset phenotype rather than a shift from infantile to late‐onset phenotype that might be expected from a simple diminution of symptoms with ERT. Questions arise regarding the etiology of the distinct distribution of weakness in this new phenotype, with increasing questions regarding exercise and musculoskeletal management. Answers require an increased understanding of the muscle pathology in Pompe disease, how that muscle pathology may be impacted by ERT, and the potential impact of, and need for, other clinical interventions. This article reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the pathology of muscle involvement in Pompe disease and the potential change in muscle pathology with ERT; the newly emerging musculoskeletal and gross motor phenotype of infantile Pompe disease treated with ERT; updated recommendations regarding musculoskeletal management in Pompe disease, particularly in children now surviving longer with residual weakness impacting development and integrity of the musculoskeletal system; and the potential impact and role of exercise in infantile Pompe survivors treated with ERT. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The GNAS locus on chromosome 20q13.11 is the archetypal complex imprinted locus. It comprises a bewildering array of alternative transcripts determined by differentially imprinted promoters which encode distinct proteins. It also provides the classic example of tissue‐specific imprinted gene expression, in which the canonical GNAS transcript coding for Gsα is expressed predominantly from the maternal allele in a set of seemingly unrelated tissues. Functionally, this rather obscure imprinting is nevertheless of considerable clinical significance, as it dictates the nature of the disease caused by inactivating mutations in Gsα, with end organ hormone resistance specifically on maternal transmission (pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, PHP1a). In addition, there is a bona fide imprinting disorder, PHP1b, which is caused specifically by DNA methylation defects in the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that determine tissue‐specific monoallelic expression of GNAS . Although the genetic defect in PHP1a and the disrupted imprinting in PHP1b both essentially result in profound reduction of Gsα activity in tissues with monoallelic GNAS expression, and despite a growing awareness of the overlap in these two conditions, there are important pathophysiological differences between the two whose basis is not fully understood. PHP1b is one of the only imprinted gene syndromes in which cis ‐acting mutations have been discovered that disrupt methylation of germline‐derived imprint marks; such imprinting mutations in GNAS are helping to provide important new insights into the mechanisms of imprinting establishment generally. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The classical form of HPE is divided in three sub‐types according to DeMyer classification, although the spectrum is far wider, ranging from the most severe, aprosencephaly/atelencephaly, to milder forms such as syntelencephaly and to the less severe ends of the spectrum. Macroscopy and microscopy abnormality patterns are described extensively, allowing a comparison of the anatomic features between each form. Disturbances observed in the main cerebral structures including the basal ganglia, the commissures, the hippocampus, the brainstem, the cerebellum, and spinal cord are reviewed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Cloacal exstrophy presents as a complex abdominal wall defect thought to result from a mesodermal abnormality. Anatomically, its main components are Omphalocele, bladder Exstrophy and Imperforate anus. Other associated malformations include renal malformations and Spine defects (OEIS complex). Historically, the prevalence ranges from 1 in 200,000 to 400,000 births, with higher rates in females. Cloacal exstrophy is likely etiologically heterogeneous as suggested by its recurrence in families and occurrence in monozygotic twins. The defect has been described in infants with limb‐body wall, with trisomy 18, and in one pregnancy exposed to Dilantin and diazepam. Due to its rarity, the use of a nonspecific diagnostic code for case identification, and lack of validation of the clinical findings, cloacal exstrophy remains an epidemiologic challenge. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence, associated anomalies and maternal characteristics among infants born with cloacal exstrophy. We used data from the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research submitted from 18 birth defect surveillance programs representing 24 countries. Cases were clinically evaluated locally and reviewed centrally by two authors. Cases of persistent cloaca were excluded. A total of 186 cases of cloacal exstrophy were identified. Overall prevalence was 1 in 131,579 births: ranging from 1 in 44,444 births in Wales to 1 in 269,464 births in South America. Live birth prevalence was 1 in 184,195 births. Prevalence ratios did not vary by maternal age. Forty‐two (22.6%) cases met the criteria for the OEIS complex, whereas 60 (32.3%) were classified as OEI and 18 (9.7%) as EIS (one with suspected VATER (0.5%)). Other findings included two cases with trisomy 13 (one without a karyotype confirmation), one with mosaic trisomy 12 (0.5%), one with mosaic 45,X (0.5%) and one classified as having amnion band sequence (0.5%). Twenty‐seven (14.5%) infants had other anomalies unrelated to cloacal exstrophy. Cloacal exstrophy is a rare anomaly with variability in prevalence by geographic location. The proportion of cases classified as OEIS complex was lower in this study than previously reported. Among all cases, 54.8% were reported to have an omphalocele. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

HPE is a classic example of a complex genetic trait with “pseudo”‐autosomal dominant transmission showing incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Clinical suspicion of HPE is typically based upon compatible craniofacial findings, the presence of developmental delay or seizures, or specific endocrinological abnormalities, and is then followed up by confirmation with brain imaging. Once a clinical diagnosis is made, a thorough genetic evaluation is necessary. This usually includes analysis of chromosomes by high‐resolution karyotyping, clinical assessment to rule‐out well recognized syndromes that are associated with HPE (e.g., Pallister‐Hall syndrome, Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz syndrome and others), and molecular studies of the most common HPE associated genes (e.g., SHH, ZIC2 and SIX3 ). In this review, we provide current step‐by‐step recommendations that are medically indicated for the genetic evaluation of patients with newly diagnosed HPE. Moreover, we provide a brief review of several available methods used in molecular diagnostics of HPE and describe the advantages and limitations of both currently available and future tests as they relate to high throughput screening, cost, and the results that they may provide.

Individuals with WS are overly friendly, gregarious, empathetic, and loquacious, but have difficulty interpreting social cues and in making and keeping friends. The neurodevelopmental profile is characterized by overall intellectual disability, strength in concrete language, weakness in visuospatial construction, difficulties with sensory modulation, balance, and tool use, and problems with attention and anxiety. Structural and functional MRI studies demonstrate that gray matter deficiency in the intraparietal sulcus alters processing of spatial information in the dorsal stream (spatial) visual pathway, likely contributing to the visuospatial construction disability. Deficient regulation of the amygdala by the oribitofrontal cortex appears to underlie both the social disinhibition and the specific phobia common in WS.

    "abstract": "Abstract Defining disease severity in patients with Pompe disease is important for prognosis and monitoring the response to therapies. Current approaches include qualitative and quantitative assessments of the disease burden, and clinical measures of the impact of the disease on affected systems. The aims of this manuscript were to review a noninvasive urinary glucose tetrasaccharide biomarker of glycogen storage, and to discuss advances in imaging techniques for determining the disease burden in Pompe disease. The glucose tetrasaccharide, Glcα1‐6Glcα1‐4Glcα1‐4Glc (Glc 4 ), is a glycogen‐derived limit dextrin that correlates with the extent of glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle. As such, it is more useful than traditional biomarkers of tissue damage, such as CK and AST, for monitoring the response to enzyme replacement therapy in patients with Pompe disease. Glc 4 is also useful as an adjunctive diagnostic test for Pompe disease when performed in conjunction with acid alpha‐glucosidase activity measurements. Review of clinical records of 208 patients evaluated for Pompe disease by this approach showed Glc 4 had 94% sensitivity and 84% specificity for Pompe disease. We propose Glc 4 is useful as an overall measure of disease burden, but does not provide information on the location and distribution of excess glycogen accumulation. In this manuscript we also review magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging techniques as alternative, noninvasive tools for quantifying glycogen and detailing changes, such as fibrofatty muscle degeneration, in specific muscle groups in Pompe disease. These techniques show promise as a means of monitoring disease progression and the response to treatment in Pompe disease. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, researchers have generated a variety of mouse models in an attempt to dissect the contribution of individual genes to the complex phenotype associated with Williams syndrome (WS). The mouse genome is easily manipulated to produce animals that are copies of humans with genetic conditions, be it with null mutations, hypomorphic mutations, point mutations, or even large deletions encompassing many genes. The existing mouse models certainly seem to implicate hemizygosity for ELN , BAZ1B , CLIP2 , and GTF2IRD1 in WS, and new mice with large deletions of the WS region are helping us to understand both the additive and potential combinatorial effects of hemizygosity for specific genes. However, not all genes that are haploinsufficient in humans prove to be so in mice and the effect of genetic background can also have a significant effect on the penetrance of many phenotypes. Thus although mouse models are powerful tools, the information garnered from their study must be carefully interpreted. Nevertheless, mouse models look set to provide a wealth of information about the neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and molecular pathways that underlie WS and in the future will act as essential tools for the development and testing of therapeutics. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The prevalence of HPE at birth is low, and risk factors have been difficult to identify. Using data from a large multi‐state population‐based case‐control study, we examined risk factors for non‐syndromic HPE. Data from maternal telephone interviews were available for 74 infants with HPE and 5871 controls born between 1997 and 2004. Several characteristics and exposures were examined, including pregnancy history, medical history, maternal diet and use of nutritional supplements, medications, tobacco, alcohol, and illegal substances. We used χ 2 ‐tests and logistic regression (excluding women with pre‐existing diabetes) to examine associations with HPE. Except for diet (year before pregnancy) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (throughout pregnancy), most exposures were examined for the time period from the month before to the third month of pregnancy. HPE was found to be associated with pre‐existing diabetes ( χ 2 = 6.0; P = 0.01), aspirin use [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6–6.9], lower education level (aOR = 2.5; 95%CI 1.1–5.6), and use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) (crude OR = 4.2; 95%CI 1.3–13.7). Consistent maternal folic acid use appeared to be protective (aOR = 0.4; 95%CI 0.2–1.0), but the association was of borderline statistical significance. While some of these findings support previous observations, other potential risk factors identified warrant further study. Published 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by inactivating mutations in the NF1 gene resulting in an increased Ras signaling cascade. Subsequently, additional syndromes with some overlapping physical manifestations such as Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, and cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome were also shown to be due in many cases to mutations in genes encoding for proteins interacting with the Ras/MAPK pathway. Although neurocutaneous manifestations have been considered hallmark features for these disorders, multiple organ systems including the musculoskeletal system are affected. Some of the overlapping musculoskeletal phenotypes include scoliosis, kyphosis, anterior chest wall anomalies, pes planus, osteopenia, and hand anomalies. However, there are also discordant skeletal phenotypes such as sphenoid wing dysplasia and tibial pseudarthrosis seen only in NF1. We provide an overview of the concordant and discordant musculoskeletal manifestations in the RASopathies. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Since 18p‐ was first described in 1963, much progress has been made in our understanding of this classic deletion condition. We have been able to establish a fairly complete picture of the phenotype when the deletion breakpoint occurs at the centromere, and we are working to establish the phenotypic effects when each gene on 18p is hemizygous. Our aim is to provide genotype‐specific anticipatory guidance and recommendations to families with an 18p‐ diagnosis. In addition, establishing the molecular underpinnings of the condition will potentially suggest targets for molecular treatments. Thus, the next step is to establish the precise effects of specific gene deletions. As we look forward to deepening our understanding of 18p‐, our focus will continue to be on the establishment of robust genotype–phenotype correlations and the penetrance of these phenotypes. We will continue to follow our 18p‐ cohort closely as they age to determine the presence or absence of some of these diagnoses, including spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), and dystonia. We will also continue to refine the critical regions for other phenotypes as we enroll additional (hopefully informative) participants into the research study and as the mechanisms of the genes in these regions are elucidated. Mouse models will also be developed to further our understanding of the effects of hemizygosity as well as to serve as models for treatment development. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) or “brittle bone disease” is currently best described as a group of hereditary connective tissue disorders related to primary defects in type I procollagen, and to alterations in type I procollagen biosynthesis, both associated with osteoporosis and increased susceptibility to bone fractures. Initially, the autosomal dominant forms of OI, caused by mutations in either COL1A1 or COL1A2 , were described. However, for decades, the molecular defect of a small percentage of patients clinically diagnosed with OI has remained elusive. It has been in the last 6 years that the genetic causes of several forms of OI with autosomal recessive inheritance have been characterized. These comprise defects of collagen chaperones, and proteins involved in type I procollagen assembly, processing and maturation, as well as proteins involved in the formation and homeostasis of bone tissue. This article reviews the recently characterized forms of recessive OI, focusing in particular on their clinical and molecular findings, and on their radiological characterisation. Clinical management and treatment of OI in general will be discussed, too. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Providing clinically relevant prognoses and treatment information for people with a chromsome18q deletion is particularly challenging because every unrelated person has a unique region of hemizygosity. The hemizygous region can involve almost any region of 18q including between 1 and 101 genes (30 Mb of DNA). Most individuals have terminal deletions, but in our cohort of over 350 individuals 23% have interstitial deletions. Because of this heterogeneity, we take a gene by gene approach to understanding the clinical consequences. There are 196 genes on 18q. We classified 133 of them as dosage insensitive, 15 (8%) as dosage sensitive leading to haploinsufficiency while another 10 (5%) have effects that are conditionally haploinsufficient and are dependent on another factor, genetic or environmental in order to cause an abnormal phenotype. Thirty‐seven genes (19%) have insufficient information to classify their dosage effect. Phenotypes attributed to single genes include: congenital heart disease, minor bone morphology changes, central nervous system dysmyelination, expressive speech delay, vesicouretreral reflux, polyposis, Pitt‐Hopkins syndrome, intellectual disability, executive function impairment, male infertility, aural atresia, and high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, identified critical regions for other phenotypes include: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and pectus excavatum, Virchow‐Robin perivascular spaces, small corpus callosum, strabismus, atopic disorders, mood disorder, IgA deficiency, nystagmus, congenital heart disease, kidney malformation, vertical talus, CNS dysmyelination growth hormone deficiency and cleft palate. Together these findings make it increasingly feasible to compile an individualized syndrome description based on each person's individuated genotype.

    "abstract": "Although most nervous system diseases affect women and men differentially, most behavioral studies using mouse models do not include subjects of both sexes. Many researchers worry that data of female mice may be unreliable due to the estrous cycle. Here, we retrospectively evaluated sex effects on coefficient of variation (CV) in 5,311 mice which had performed the same place navigation protocol in the water‐maze and in 4,554 mice tested in the same open field arena. Confidence intervals for Cohen's d as measure of effect size were computed and tested for equivalence with 0.2 as equivalence margin. Despite the large sample size, only few behavioral parameters showed a significant sex effect on CV. Confidence intervals of effect size indicated that CV was either equivalent or showed a small sex difference at most, accounting for less than 2% of total group to group variation of CV. While female mice were potentially slightly more variable in water‐maze acquisition and in the open field, males tended to perform less reliably in the water‐maze probe trial. In addition to evaluating variability, we also directly compared mean performance of female and male mice and found them to be equivalent in both water‐maze place navigation and open field exploration. Our data confirm and extend other large scale studies in demonstrating that including female mice in experiments does not cause a relevant increase of data variability. Our results make a strong case for including mice of both sexes whenever open field or water‐maze are used in preclinical research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lysosomes are intracellular organelles containing acid hydrolases that degrade biological macromolecules. Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are caused by absent activity of one or more of these enzymes due to mutations of genes encoding lysosomal hydrolases or enzymes that process, target, and transport these enzymes. The specific signs and symptoms of each LSD derive from the type of material accumulated within the lysosome, the site (organ) of accumulation and the response of the body (sometimes in the form of an inflammatory or immune response) to the accumulated material. Interest for inclusion of these disorders in newborn screening programs derives from the availability of effective therapy in the form of enzyme replacement or substrate reduction therapy and bone marrow transplant that may improve long‐term outcome especially if started prior to irreversible organ damage. Based on the availability of therapy and suitable screening methods, Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Pompe disease, mucopolysaccharidosis I and II, Niemann–Pick disease, and Krabbe disease are candidates for newborn screening. Pilot newborn screening projects have been performed for some of these conditions that indicate the feasibility of this approach. This review will provide insight into these screening strategies and discuss their advantages and limitations. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "As the public's interest in genetics and genomics has increased, there has been corresponding and unprecedented growth in direct‐to‐consumer genetic testing (DTC‐GT). Although regulatory concerns have limited true DTC‐GT available without a physician order, the paradigm has shifted to a model of consumer‐directed genetic testing (CD‐GT) in which patients are researching testing options and requesting specific genetic testing from their health‐care providers. However, many nongenetics health‐care providers do not have the background, education, interest, or time to order and/or interpret typical clinical genetic testing, let alone DTC‐GT. The lines between CD‐GT, DTC‐GT, and traditional clinical genetic testing are also blurring with the same types of tests available in different settings (e.g., carrier screening) and tests merging medical and nonmedical results, increasing the complexity for consumer decision‐making and clinician management. The genetics community has the training to work with CD‐GT, but there has been a hesitancy to commit to working with these results and questions about what to do when consumers have more complicated asks, like interpretation of raw data. Additionally, at the rate with which CD‐GT is growing, there are questions about having sufficient genetics professionals to meet the potential genetic counseling demand. While there are many complex questions and challenges, this market represents a chance for the genetics community to address and unmet need. We will review the history of the CD‐GT/DTC‐GT market and outline the issues and opportunities our profession is facing.",

Early attention focused on the detection of aneuploidy, but more recent technology opens the possibility of high resolution detection of copy number abnormalities and even whole genome or exome sequencing to detect both inherited and de novo mutations. In the interim, cell‐free noninvasive prenatal testing NIPT has allowed improved detection of aneuploidy, but this has led to a sharp reduction in the number of amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) procedures, which inevitably implies reduced detection of serious de novo deletion abnormalities. Attention has focused of both fetal nucleated red blood cells (fnRBCs) and trophoblasts. Recent progress presented at meetings, but not yet published, suggests that it will soon be possible to perform genome‐wide relatively high resolution detection of deletions and duplications by recovering fetal trophoblasts during the first trimester and analyzing them by whole gene genome amplification followed by copy number analysis using arrays or next generation sequencing. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In contrast with other well known heritable connective tissue disorders with severe cardiovascular involvement (e.g., Marfan syndrome), most EDS patients share a nearly normal life span, but are severely limited by disabling features, such as pain, fatigue and headache. In this work, pertinent literature is reviewed with focus on prevalence, features and possible pathogenic mechanisms of headache in EDSs. Gathered data are fragmented and generally have a low level of evidence. Headache is reported in no less than 1/3 of the patients. Migraine results the most common type in the hypermobility type of EDS. Other possibly related headache disorders include tension‐type headache, new daily persistent headache, headache attributed to spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leakage, headache secondary to Chiari malformation, cervicogenic headache and neck–tongue syndrome, whose association still lacks of reliable prevalence studies. The underlying pathogenesis seems complex and variably associated with cardiovascular dysautonomia, cervical spine and temporomandibular joint instability/dysfunction, meningeal fragility, poor sleep quality, pain‐killer drugs overuse and central sensitization. Particular attention is posed on a presumed subclinical cervical spine dysfunction. Standard treatment is always symptomatic and usually unsuccessful. Assessment and management procedures are discussed in order to put some basis for ameliorating the actual patients' needs and nurturing future research. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 47, XXY or Klinefelter syndrome (KS), the most common chromosomal aberration in males, is characterized by either absolute or relative hypogonadism with frequent decline in serum testosterone (T) following the onset of puberty. Decreased T levels are the result of testicular dysfunction with decrease in size of Leydig cells, and loss of germs and Sertoli cells leading to tubular hyalinization. Increase in estradiol results from over‐expression of aromatase CYP19. Deficient androgen production and observed varied response of end‐organs to T leads to delayed progression of puberty with decreased facial/body hair, poor muscle development, osteoporosis, and gynecomastia. It is possible that hypogonadism and excessive estradiol production contribute to emotional and social immaturity, and specific learning disabilities in KS. Based on the authors' experience and literature review, early fertility preservation and hormonal supplementation may normalize pubertal development, prevent metabolic sequelae of hypogonadism, and have a positive effect on academic and social development. No randomized clinical trials are available studying the effects of T supplementation on reproductive or cognitive issues in KS. Aggressive T supplementation (topical gel) and selective use of aromatase inhibitors may be considered at the onset of puberty with careful follow‐up and titration to reach age‐specific high‐normal physiologic serum values. The decision to institute hormonal therapy should be part of a multidisciplinary approach including physical, speech, behavioral, and occupational therapy. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The reasons for this are several, but two of the most significant are limited evidence about the clinical implications of the variants and a lack of a comprehensive knowledge base that captures genetic variants, their phenotypic associations, and other pertinent phenotypic information that is openly accessible to clinical groups attempting to interpret sequencing data. As the field of medicine begins to incorporate genome-scale analysis into clinical care, approaches need to be developed for collecting and characterizing data on the clinical implications of variants, developing consensus on their actionability, and making this information available for clinical use. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Wellcome Trust thus convened a workshop to consider the processes and resources needed to: (1) identify clinically valid genetic variants; (2) decide whether they are actionable and what the action should be; and (3) provide this information for clinical use.

    "abstract": "In the last decade, increasing attention has been devoted to the extra‐articular and extra‐cutaneous manifestations of joint hypermobility syndrome, also termed Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type (i.e., JHS/EDS‐HT). Despite the fact that the current diagnostic criteria for both disorders remain focused on joint hypermobility, musculoskeletal pain and skin changes, medical practice and research have started investigating a wide spectrum of visceral, neurological and developmental complications, which represent major burdens for affected individuals. In particular, children with generalized joint hypermobility often present with various neurodevelopmental issues and can be referred for neurological consultation. It is common that investigations in these patients yield negative or inconsistent results, eventually leading to the exclusion of any structural neurological or muscle disorder. In the context of specialized clinics for connective tissue disorders, a clear relationship between generalized joint hypermobility and a characteristic neurodevelopmental profile affecting coordination is emerging. The clinical features of these patients tend to overlap with those of developmental coordination disorder and can be associated with learning and other disabilities. Physical and psychological consequences of these additional difficulties add to the chief manifestations of the pre‐existing connective tissue disorder, affecting the well‐being and development of children and their families. In this review, particular attention is devoted to the nature of the link between joint hypermobility, coordination difficulties and neurodevelopmental issues in children. Presumed pathogenesis and management issues are explored in order to attract more attention on this association and nurture future clinical research. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The nuclear factor one (NFI) site‐specific DNA‐binding proteins represent a family of transcription factors that are important for the development of multiple organ systems, including the brain. During brain development in mice, the expression patterns of Nfia , Nfib , and Nfix overlap, and knockout mice for each of these exhibit overlapping brain defects, including megalencephaly, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, and enlarged ventricles, which implies a common but not redundant function in brain development. In line with these models, human phenotypes caused by haploinsufficiency of NFIA , NFIB , and NFIX display significant overlap, sharing neurodevelopmental deficits, macrocephaly, brain anomalies, and variable somatic overgrowth. Other anomalies may be present depending on the NFI gene involved. The possibility of variants in NFI genes should therefore be considered in individuals with intellectual disability and brain overgrowth, with individual NFI‐related conditions being differentiated from one another by additional signs and symptoms. The exception is provided by specific NFIX variants that act in a dominant negative manner, as these cause a recognizable entity with more severe cognitive impairment and marked bone dysplasia, Marshall–Smith syndrome. NFIX duplications are associated with a phenotype opposite to that of haploinsufficiency, characterized by short stature, small head circumference, and delayed bone age. The spectrum of NFI‐related disorders will likely be further expanded, as larger cohorts are assessed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Overall, approximately one‐quarter of patients with genetic eye diseases will receive a molecular diagnosis. Patients with developmental eye disorders face a number of diagnostic challenges including phenotypic heterogeneity with significant asymmetry, coexisting ocular and systemic disease, limited understanding of human eye development and the associated genetic repertoire, and lack of access to next generation sequencing as regarded not to impact on patient outcomes/management with cost implications. Herein, we report our real world experience from a pediatric ocular genetics service over a 12 month period with 72 consecutive patients from 62 families, and that from a cohort of 322 patients undergoing whole genome sequencing (WGS) through the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project; encompassing microphthalmia, anophthalmia, ocular coloboma (MAC), anterior segment dysgenesis anomalies (ASDA), primary congenital glaucoma, congenital cataract, infantile nystagmus, and albinism. Overall molecular diagnostic rates reached 24.9% for those recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project (73/293 families were solved), but up to 33.9% in the clinic setting (20/59 families). WGS was able to improve genetic diagnosis for MAC patients (15.7%), but not for ASDA (15.0%) and congenital cataracts (44.7%). Increased sample sizes and accurate human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms are required to improve diagnostic accuracy. The significant mixed complex ocular phenotypes distort these rates and lead to missed variants if the correct gene panel is not applied. Increased molecular diagnoses will help to explain the genotype–phenotype relationships of these developmental eye disorders. In turn, this will lead to improved integrated care pathways, understanding of disease, and future therapeutic development.",

Other associated clinical features include scoliosis, seizures, renal anomalies, and cardiac anomalies. However, many of the published Sotos syndrome clinical descriptions are based on studies of children; the phenotype in adults with Sotos syndrome is not yet well described. Given that it is now 17 years since disruption of NSD1 was shown to cause Sotos syndrome, many of the children first reported are now adults. It is therefore timely to investigate the phenotype of 44 adults with Sotos syndrome and NSD1 pathogenic variants. We have shown that adults with Sotos syndrome display a wide spectrum of intellectual ability with functioning ranging from fully independent to fully dependent. Reproductive rates are low. In our cohort, median height in adult women is +1.9 SD and men +0.5 SD . There is a distinctive facial appearance in adults with a tall, square, prominent chin. Reassuringly, adults with Sotos syndrome are generally healthy with few new medical issues; however, lymphedema, poor dentition, hearing loss, contractures and tremor have developed in a small number of individuals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Dysautonomia (autonomic dysfunction) occurs in the Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD). Symptoms include palpitations, dizziness, presyncope, and syncope, especially when standing upright. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance are usually relieved by sitting or lying and may be exacerbated by stimuli in daily life that cause vasodilatation, such as food ingestion, exertion, and heat. Neurocardiovascular dysautonomia may result in postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), a major cause of orthostatic intolerance. It is defined by a rise in heart rate of &gt;30 beats per minute (bpm) in adults and &gt;40 bpm in teenagers while upright, without a fall in blood pressure (BP; orthostatic hypotension). In some, it can be compounded by the presence of low BP. For many, there is delay in clinicians recognizing the nature of the symptoms, and recognizing EDS or HSD, leading to delays in treatment. The onset of PoTS may be linked to an event such as infection, trauma, surgery, or stress. Gastrointestinal and urinary bladder involvement may occur, along with thermoregulatory dysfunction. In some, the mast cell activation syndrome may be contributary, especially if it causes vasodilatation. This paper reviews neurocardiovascular dysautonomia with an emphasis on PoTS, its characteristics, associations, pathophysiology, investigation, and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Exome and genome sequencing are increasingly utilized in research studies and clinical care and can provide clinically relevant information beyond the initial intent for sequencing, including medically actionable secondary findings. Despite ongoing debate about sharing this information with patients and participants, a growing number of clinical laboratories and research programs routinely report secondary findings that increase the risk for selected diseases. Recently, there has been a push to maximize the potential benefit of this practice by implementing proactive genomic screening at the population level irrespective of medical history, but the feasibility of deploying population‐scale proactive genomic screening requires scaling key elements of the genomic data evaluation process. Herein, we describe the motivation, development, and implementation of a population‐scale variant‐first screening pipeline combining bioinformatics‐based filtering with a manual review process to screen for clinically relevant findings in research exomes generated through the DiscovEHR collaboration within Geisinger's MyCode® research project. Consistent with other studies, this pipeline yields a screen‐positive detection rate between 2.1 and 2.6% (depending on inclusion of those with prior indication‐based testing) in 130,048 adult MyCode patient‐participants screened for clinically relevant findings in 60 genes. Our variant‐first pipeline affords cost and time savings by filtering out negative cases, thereby avoiding analysis of each exome one‐by‐one, as typically employed in the diagnostic setting. While research is still needed to fully appreciate the benefits of population genomic screening, MyCode provides the first demonstration of a program at scale to help shape how population genomic screening is integrated into routine clinical care.",

Ciliopathies are a group of diseases that can affect multiple organ systems due to dysfunction or the absence of cilia. Cilia are small organelles, extending from the cell surface. Nonmotile monocilia are ubiquitously present during cell development fulfilling chemosensory functions, whereas specialized epithelia such as the ependyma, lining the inner surface of the brain ventricles, exhibit multiciliated cells propelling fluids along the cell surface. This review highlights ciliopathies and their pathophysiology in congenital hydrocephalus. While nonmotile ciliopathies are often associated with severe prenatal hydrocephalus combined with other severe congenital brain malformations, motile ciliopathies, especially those associated with defects in multiciliogenesis can cause hydrocephalus and chronic lung disease.",

When mutated, this protein results in a variety of phenotypes ranging from multiorgan involvement, such as OFD type I (OFDI) and Joubert syndromes (JBS10), and Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), to the engagement of single tissues such as in the case of retinitis pigmentosa (RP23). The inheritance pattern of these condition differs from X‐linked dominant male‐lethal (OFDI) to X‐linked recessive (JBS10, PCD, and RP23). Distinctive biological peculiarities of the protein, which can contribute to explain the extreme clinical variability and the genetic mechanisms underlying the different disorders are discussed. The extensive spectrum of clinical manifestations observed in OFD1 ‐mutated patients represents a paradigmatic example of the complexity of genetic diseases. The elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this complexity will expand our comprehension of inherited disorders and will improve the clinical management of patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Genetic kidney disease comprises a diverse group of disorders. These can roughly be divided in the phenotype groups congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, ciliopathies, glomerulopathies, stone disorders, tubulointerstitial kidney disease, and tubulopathies. Many etiologies can lead to chronic kidney disease that can progress to end‐stage kidney disease. Despite each individual disease being rare, together these genetic disorders account for a large proportion of kidney disease cases. With the introduction of massively parallel sequencing, genetic testing has become more accessible, but a comprehensive analysis of the diagnostic yield is lacking. This review gives an overview of the diagnostic yield of genetic testing across and within the full range of kidney disease phenotypes through a systematic literature search that resulted in 115 included articles. Patient, test, and cohort characteristics that can influence the diagnostic yield are highlighted. Detection of copy number variations and their contribution to the diagnostic yield is described for all phenotype groups. Also, the impact of a genetic diagnosis for a patient and family members, which can be diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic, is shown through the included articles. This review will allow clinicians to estimate an a priori probability of finding a genetic cause for the kidney disease in their patients.",

Depicting the whole clinical spectrum of COL4A1/2-related manifestations is challenging, and there is no consensus on management and preventative strategies. Based on a systematic review of current evidence on COL4A1/2-related disease, we developed a clinical questionnaire that we administered to 43 individuals from 23 distinct families carrying pathogenic variants. In this cohort, we extended ophthalmological and cardiological examinations to asymptomatic individuals and those with only limited or mild, often nonspecific, clinical signs commonly occurring in the general population (i.e., oligosymptomatic). The most frequent clinical findings emerging from both the literature review and the questionnaire included stroke (203/685, 29.6%), seizures or epilepsy (199/685, 29.0%), intellectual disability or developmental delay (168/685, 24.5%), porencephaly/schizencephaly (168/685, 24.5%), motor impairment (162/685, 23.6%), cataract (124/685, 18.1%), hematuria (63/685, 9.2%), and retinal arterial tortuosity (58/685, 8.5%). In oligosymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers, ophthalmological investigations detected retinal vascular tortuosity (5/13, 38.5%), dysgenesis of the anterior segment (4/13, 30.8%), and cataract (2/13, 15.4%), while cardiological investigations were unremarkable except for mild ascending aortic ectasia in 1/8 (12.5%). Our multimodal approach confirms highly variable penetrance and expressivity in COL4A1/2-related conditions, even at the intrafamilial level with neurological involvement being the most frequent and severe finding in both children and adults. We propose a protocol for prevention and management based on individualized risk estimation and periodic multiorgan evaluations.",

Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood, the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz (SLO) syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling, and better treatment.

    "abstract": "Despite significant effort, understanding of the molecular causes and mechanisms of bipolar disorder (BD) remains a major challenge. Numerous molecular genetic linkage and association studies have been conducted over the last two decades; however, the data are quite inconsistent or even controversial. This article develops an argument that molecular studies of BD would benefit significantly from adding an epigenetic (epiG) perspective. EpiG factors refer to modifications of DNA and chromatin that \"orchestrate\" the activity of the genome, including regulation of gene expression. EpiG mechanisms are consistent with various non-Mendelian features of BD such as the relatively high degree of discordance in monozygotic (MZ) twins, the critical age group for susceptibility to the disease, clinical differences in males and females, and fluctuation of the disease course, including interchanges of manic and depressive phases, among others. Apart from the phenomenological consistency, molecular epiG peculiarities may shed new light on the understanding of controversial molecular genetic findings. The relevance of epigenetics for the molecular studies of BD is demonstrated using the examples of genetic studies of BD on chromosome 11p and the X chromosome. A spectrum of epiG mechanisms such as genomic imprinting, tissue-specific effects, paramutagenesis, and epiG polymorphism, as well as epiG regulation of X chromosome inactivation, is introduced. All this serves the goal of demonstrating that epiG factors cannot be ignored anymore in complex phenotypes such as BD, and systematic large-scale epiG studies of BD have to be initiated.",

These new methods are very useful in two major aspects: further characterization of chromosome abnormalities as detected with routine banding analysis, including additions, duplications, deletions, translocations, markers, or complex aberrations; and screening for “hidden” chromosome aberrations in patients with an apparently normal karyotype. These new methods have great diagnostic potential in prenatal, postnatal, and preimplantational settings. Although powerful, at this point, they are primarily research tools in nature. It is essential that these new methods be used in conjunction with standard methods in order to maximize obtainable information for better management of patients with MR. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wilms tumor (WT), an embryonic tumor arising from undifferentiated renal mesenchyme, has been a productive model for understanding the role of genes in both tumorigenesis and normal organogenesis. Approximately 2% of WT patients have a family history of WT, and even sporadic WT is thought to have a strong genetic component to its etiology. Familial WT cases generally have an earlier age of onset and an increased frequency of bilateral disease, although there is variability among WT families, with some families displaying later than average ages at diagnosis. One WT gene, WT1 at 11p13, has been cloned, but only a minority of tumors carry detectable mutations at that locus, and it can be excluded as the predisposition gene in most WT families. Two familial WT genes have been localized, FWT1 at 17q12–q21 and FWT2 at 19q13.4; lack of linkage in some WT families to either of these loci implies the existence of at least one additional familial WT gene. Originally modeled as the inheritance of a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, molecular analysis of familial tumors not linked to 11p13 have provided data suggesting that this model may be overly simplistic and/or not applicable to all WT families. Identification of the FWT1 and FWT2 genes will help clarify this and will also likely aid in our understanding in general of the roles of the various WT genes and their genetic interactions in the development of WT. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

By exploring the parents' concerns and needs surrounding the child's diagnosis, a genetic provider can help to facilitate effective coping. This study tested the association of measures of parental uncertainty and perceived control with the perceived helpfulness of the genetic counselor. A survey was distributed to 875 members of the Chromosome Deletion Outreach (CDO) support group. We hypothesized that parents' perceptions about the helpfulness of the genetic counselor would modify the relationship between perceived uncertainty, perceived control, and coping. Among the 363 respondents, there was a significant negative correlation of the perceived helpfulness of seeing a genetic counselor with the levels of uncertainty (rs = −0.20, P ‐value &lt; 0.001). Lower perceived helpfulness of the genetic counselor, along with less perceived personal control, less benefit of a diagnosis, and lower parental age were significant predictors of the highest perceptions of uncertainty. The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping was used as a framework for interpreting the relationships between parental uncertainty, perceived control, and outcome variables. There was a significant positive correlation between parents' perceived personal control and their reports of helpfulness of the genetic counselor (rs = 0.20, P ‐value &lt;0.0006). Genetic counseling can be enhanced for parents faced with rare disorders by using interventions focused on reducing feelings of uncertainty and enhancing feelings of control. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The brain is abnormally large in some but not all children with autism during post‐natal development. Age‐related changes in brain volume in autism are complex and appear to be abnormal from infancy into adulthood. Diffuse differences in total and regional gray and white matter volumes are found. The volumetric abnormalities appear to follow anomalous, complex, and non‐uniform developmental curves. Diffuse abnormalities of brain chemical concentrations, neural network anatomy, brain lateralization, intra‐ and inter‐hemispheric morphologic and functional connectivity, and serotonin synthesis capacity are also found. Abnormalities of head growth are first apparent during infancy. Abnormalities of total brain volume, gray and white matter volumes, brain chemistry, serotonin synthesis, and brain electrophysiology are evident by early childhood. Currently, no method of brain imaging helps with diagnosis or treatment of idiopathic autism, but ongoing research aims to unravel the heterogeneity of autism and may provide future diagnostic tools that inform treatment. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Cancer-related (DeltaR(2) = 0.18, P < or = 0.001), general (DeltaR(2) = 0.04, P < or = 0.05), and genetic testing distress (DeltaR(2) = 0.12, P < or = 0.01) were associated with intolerance for uncertainty at 1 month post-disclosure. The interaction of intolerance for uncertainty and breast cancer perceived risk predicted cancer-related (DeltaR(2) = 0.10, P < or = 0.001) and genetic testing distress (DeltaR(2) = 0.09, P < or = 0.01) at 6 months post-disclosure. Distress was highest among patients with highest perceived risk and intolerance for uncertainty, suggesting that those who have difficulty coping with their ambiguous risk are at risk for long-term distress. The clinical and research implications of these results are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to type A dissections (TAAD) can occur in association with a genetic syndrome, such as Marfan syndrome (MFS), or as an autosomal dominant disorder in the absence of syndromic features, termed familial TAAD. Familial TAAD demonstrates genetic heterogeneity, and linkage studies have identified three TAAD loci at 5q13‐14 ( TAAD1 ), 11q23 ( FAA1 ), and 3p24‐25 ( TAAD2 ). The underlying genetic heterogeneity of TAAD is reflected in the phenotypic variation associated with familial TAAD with respect to age of onset, progression, penetrance, and association with additional cardiac and vascular features. Recently, mutations in the TGFBR2 gene have been identified as the cause of disease linked to the TAAD2 locus, supporting the hypothesis that dysregulation of TGFβ signaling is a mechanism leading to aneurysms and dissections. The recent identification of the TGFβ pathway as a key target in the molecular pathogenesis of TAAD has opened new avenues for future genetic and therapeutic research. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Dozens of papers have explored the biology, kinetics, and clinical significance of both cell‐free fetal DNA and mRNA in the maternal circulation. As a result, our overall understanding of fetal nucleic acid trafficking has expanded. To date, two applications, gender determination and fetal RhD status, have translated into clinical medicine. However, with advanced molecular techniques such as mass spectrometry, real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and gene expression arrays, the ease with which fetal genes can be detected within the mother has greatly improved. Newly identified placental and fetal mRNA transcripts as well as an epigenetically modified placental DNA marker, maspin , have universal applicability. Global expression analyses of fetal mRNA in both amniotic fluid and blood provide new insights into fetal development and pathology. Prenatal diagnosis is poised to evolve from detection of aneuploidy to detection of deviation from normal development, which should provide novel opportunities for fetal treatment. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Adults with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and the subsets of individuals with attenuated phenotype subsumed under the umbrella term of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) provide clinicians with a challenge. Compounding this, FASD is different from most genetic syndromes since a specific diagnostic biological test is not available. The diagnosis first needs to be suspected and confirmation requires a diagnostic assessment that is best carried out in the context of a multi‐disciplinary team approach. There is surprisingly little research published on the prevalence, natural history, medical, and social complications relevant to adults with FASD. The evidence that is emerging suggests that this disorder is common, and that services to diagnose and treat these individuals are limited. Adults with FASD have a higher incidence of impairments in social adaptive and executive function, and a higher degree of psychopathology when compared to the general population. The impact of FASD has significant and serious effects on those affected with FASD, their families, and our communities. There is a need for improved access to diagnosis, and more research and evaluation of interventions currently in use. In this paper, we describe the current diagnostic criteria, the differential diagnosis, the prevalence, natural history, the behavioral and mental health consequences, medical and social management issues, and interventions for adults affected with this disorder. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

A community engagement pilot study was conducted to identify public attitudes and concerns about the proposed cohort study, including the ethics of involving children. The pilot included 15 focus groups where the inclusion of children in the proposed cohort study was discussed. Focus groups, conducted in six cities, included 141 adults of different ages, incomes, genders, ethnicities, and races. Many of the concerns expressed by participants mirrored those addressed in pediatric research guidelines. These concerns included minimizing children's fear, pain, and burdens; whether to include young children; and how to obtain children's assent. There was little agreement about which children can assent. Some voiced concern about children's privacy, but most expected that parents would have access to children's study results. Some believed children would not benefit from participating, while others identified personal and societal benefits that might accrue. A few people believed that children's participation would not advance the study's goals. To successfully include children, proposed cohort study would need to address children's changing capabilities and rights as they grow and reach the age of consent. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An obstetrical ultrasound examination provides invaluable information regarding the fetus. Until the mid‐1980s, ultrasound in the first trimester was limited to localization of the pregnancy, establishing viability, and accurate dating. With the advent of high‐resolution ultrasound and transvaginal scanning, a significant amount of information about the fetus can be gained and provided to the patient at a very early stage in gestation. This article provides an overview of the role of first trimester (11–13 + 6 weeks' gestation) ultrasound in screening and diagnosis of fetal anomalies. The first trimester is an ideal time for screening for aneuploidy, primarily due to the advantages that nuchal translucency (NT) measurement provides. NT measurement is also useful in establishing the risk of congenital cardiac disorders and a number of genetic and non‐genetic syndromes. Significant NT thickening is associated with an increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality. Potential mechanisms resulting in increased NT are discussed. A number of new ultrasound markers for fetal aneuploidy have been investigated over the past several years, some of which appear to improve the screening efficacy of early ultrasonography. The role of these is reviewed. A number of fetal anomalies can now be consistently diagnosed in the first trimester. Their appearance at this early gestational age is discussed as well. It is clear that, data obtained by first trimester ultrasound are useful in counseling expectant parents and in planning the appropriate follow‐up. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent genomic sequence annotation suggests that the long arm of human chromosome 21 encodes more than 400 genes. Because there is no evidence to exclude any significant segment of 21q from containing genes relevant to the Down syndrome (DS) cognitive phenotype, all genes in this entire set must be considered as candidates. Only a subset, however, is likely to make critical contributions. Determining which these are is both a major focus in biology and a critical step in efficient development of therapeutics. The subtle molecular abnormality in DS, the 50% increase in chromosome 21 gene expression, presents significant challenges for researchers in detection and quantitation. Another challenge is the current limitation in understanding gene functions and in interpreting biological characteristics. Here, we review information on chromosome 21‐encoded proteins compiled from the literature and from genomics and proteomics databases. For each protein, we summarize their evolutionary conservation, the complexity of their known protein interactions and their level of expression in brain, and discuss the implications and limitations of these data. For a subset, we discuss neurologically relevant phenotypes of mouse models that include knockouts, mutations, or overexpression. Lastly, we highlight a small number of genes for which recent evidence suggests a function in biochemical/cellular pathways that are relevant to cognition. Until knowledge deficits are overcome, we suggest that effective development of gene–phenotype correlations in DS requires a serious and continuous effort to assimilate broad categories of information on chromosome 21 genes, plus the creation of more versatile mouse models. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

It is characterized by neurologic degeneration, behavioral problems, and mental decline. Somatic features are relatively mild and patients with this disorder can reach late adulthood. It is the most common subtype of MPS in the Netherlands and probably underdiagnosed in adult persons with mental retardation (MR). In order to increase knowledge on the adult phenotype and natural history in Sanfilippo type B, we present the clinical data of 20 patients with this disorder. Sixteen of them were followed for one to three decades. Six died between 28 and 69 years of age, mainly from pneumonia and cachexia; the surviving patients were 18–63 years old. Apart from the youngest, they had lost mobility at 36–68 years. Most had developed physical problems, in particular in the 4th–6th decade of life: cardiac disease (cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillations), arthritis, skin blistering, swallowing difficulties requiring feeding by a gastrostomy tube, and seizures. The course of the disease was dominated in most of them by challenging behavioral problems with restlessness, extreme screaming and hitting, difficult to prevent or to treat pharmaceutically. Even in absence of knowledge of the history of an elderly patient with MR, the presence of behavioral problems should prompt metabolic investigation for MPS. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Here, we provide an overview of normal embryonic morphogenesis during the critical window for HPE induction, focusing on the morphology and positional relationship of the developing brain and subjacent prechordal plate and prechordal mesoderm cell populations. Subsequent morphogenesis of the HPE spectrum is then examined in selected teratogenesis mouse models. The temporal profile of Sonic Hedgehog expression in rostral embryonic cell populations and evidence for direct or indirect perturbation of the Hedgehog pathway by teratogenic agents in the genesis of HPE is highlighted.

Isolated HPE, which is highly genetically heterogeneous, can be due to major chromosomal abnormalities. Initially, karyotype approach led to the identification of several recurrent chromosomal anomalies predicting different HPE loci. Subsequently, several genes were isolated from these critical HPE regions, but point mutations and deletions in these genes were found only in 25% of the genetic cases. In order to identify other HPE genes, a more accurate investigation of the genome in HPE patients was necessary. To date, high‐resolution cytogenetic techniques such as subtelomeric multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and microarray‐based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) have enhanced chromosomal aberration analysis. In this article, we have updated the cytogenetic anomalies associated with HPE in a map listing all the subtelomeric and interstitial deletions that have been characterized either by karyotype, MLPA, or array CGH. The accumulation of recurrent genomic imbalances will lead to the further delineation of minimal critical HPE loci, which is the first step to the identification of new HPE genes. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Although LVNC often occurs in an isolated entity, it may also be present in various types of congenital heart disease (CHD). The most prevalent CHD in LVNC is Ebstein anomaly, which is a rare form of CHD characterized by apical displacement and partial fusion of the septal and posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve with the ventricular septum. Several reports of sporadic as well as familial cases of Ebstein anomaly associated with LVNC have been reported. Recent studies identified mutations in the MYH7 gene, encoding the sarcomeric β‐myosin heavy chain protein, in patients harboring this specific phenotype. Here, we will review the association between Ebstein anomaly, LVNC and mutations in MYH7, which seems to represent a subtype of Ebstein anomaly with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable penetrance. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Among human birth defect syndromes, malformations affecting the face are perhaps the most striking due to cultural and psychological expectations of facial shape. One such syndrome is auriculocondylar syndrome (ACS), in which patients present with defects in ear and mandible development. Affected structures arise from cranial neural crest cells, a population of cells in the embryo that reside in the pharyngeal arches and give rise to most of the bone, cartilage and connective tissue of the face. Recent studies have found that most cases of ACS arise from defects in signaling molecules associated with the endothelin signaling pathway. Disruption of this signaling pathway in both mouse and zebrafish results in loss of identity of neural crest cells of the mandibular portion of the first pharyngeal arch and the subsequent repatterning of these cells, leading to homeosis of lower jaw structures into more maxillary‐like structures. These findings illustrate the importance of endothelin signaling in normal human craniofacial development and illustrate how clinical and basic science approaches can coalesce to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of human birth defect syndromes. Further, understanding the genetic basis for ACS that lies outside of known endothelin signaling components may help elucidate unknown aspects critical to the establishment of neural crest cell patterning during facial morphogenesis. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The RASopathies, one of the largest groups of multiple congenital anomaly syndromes known, are caused by germline mutations in various genes encoding components of the Ras/mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The RASopathies have many overlapping characteristics, including craniofacial manifestations, cardiac malformations, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and ocular abnormalities, neurocognitive impairment, hypotonia, and an increased risk of developing cancer. Costello syndrome (CS) and cardio‐facio‐cutaneous (CFC) syndrome are two of the more rare RASopathies. CS is caused by activating mutations in HRAS , and CFC is caused by dysregulation of signaling in the Ras/MAPK pathway due to mutations in BRAF , MEK1, or MEK2 . The Ras/MAPK pathway, which has been well‐studied in cancer, is an attractive target for inhibition in the treatment of various malignancies utilizing small molecule therapeutics that specifically inhibit the pathway. With many inhibitors of the Ras/MAPK pathway in clinical trials, the notion of using these molecules to ameliorate developmental defects in CS and CFC is under consideration. CS and CFC, like other syndromes in their class, have a progressive phenotype and may be amenable to inhibition or normalization of signaling. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This Commentary addresses issues related to exposures to teratogens and makes the case for increased research into the safety of medication usage during pregnancy for mothers and fetuses. Not only are medications commonly used during pregnancy, but evidence points to an increasing prevalence and number of drug exposures experienced by the embryo or fetus, particularly during the critical first trimester of pregnancy. Although the first trimester represents a particularly vulnerable period of organogenesis, exposures during other gestational time periods may also be associated with deleterious outcomes. In addition to the changing (and in many cases unknown) risks to a developing fetus, other challenges to studying medication exposures and their effects during pregnancy include the dramatic changes in physiology that occur in pregnant women and the ethical dilemmas posed by including this vulnerable population in randomized controlled trials of safety and efficacy. However, without adequate knowledge of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of medication use in pregnancy, women may be under-dosed to minimize exposure or not treated at all, resulting in inadequate treatment and potential harm to the mother and her baby. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is undertaking studies on medications and teratogenic exposures during pregnancy, including alcohol, maternal diabetes, oral hypoglycemic agents, and antiviral medications, through several of its research networks. Although this is a start, there is a critical need for further research on medications used during pregnancy, especially their effects on both the mother and her developing child.",

In addition, the behavioral characterization of autism has also entered the public consciousness and professional domains increasingly in the past 30 years, the effects of which we are continually coming to terms. A diagnosis of autism that once seemed quite unusual is now considered almost epidemic. Increasing numbers of individuals diagnosed with autism and related pervasive developmental disabilities will, in turn, affect the calculated prevalence of the disorder. In this essay, I attempt to account for the increasing prevalence of autism and autism‐related disorders by examining its changing criteria, the individuals and instruments used to make the diagnosis, the reliability and validity of same, and the sample sizes and other aspects of the methodology needed to make an accurate estimate of its prevalence. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Perlman syndrome is associated with high neonatal mortality and, survivors have developmental delay and a high risk of Wilms tumor. Recently a Perlman syndrome locus was mapped to chromosome 2q37 and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations were characterized in DIS3L2 . The DIS3L2 gene product has ribonuclease activity and homology to the DIS3 component of the RNA exosome. It has been postulated that the clinical features of Perlman syndrome result from disordered RNA metabolism and, though the precise targets of DIS3L2 have yet to be characterized, in cellular models DIS3L2 knockdown is associated with abnormalities of cell growth and division. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Craniosynostosis is one of the most common craniofacial disorders encountered in clinical genetics practice, with an overall incidence of 1 in 2,500. Between 30% and 70% of syndromic craniosynostoses are caused by mutations in hotspots in the fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) genes or in the TWIST1 gene with the difference in detection rates likely to be related to different study populations within craniofacial centers. Here we present results from molecular testing of an Australia and New Zealand cohort of 630 individuals with a diagnosis of craniosynostosis. Data were obtained by Sanger sequencing of FGFR1 , FGFR2 , and FGFR3 hotspot exons and the TWIST1 gene, as well as copy number detection of TWIST1 . Of the 630 probands, there were 231 who had one of 80 distinct mutations (36%). Among the 80 mutations, 17 novel sequence variants were detected in three of the four genes screened. In addition to the proband cohort there were 96 individuals who underwent predictive or prenatal testing as part of family studies. Dysmorphic features consistent with the known FGFR1‐3 / TWIST1 ‐associated syndromes were predictive for mutation detection. We also show a statistically significant association between splice site mutations in FGFR2 and a clinical diagnosis of Pfeiffer syndrome, more severe clinical phenotypes associated with FGFR2 exon 10 versus exon 8 mutations, and more frequent surgical procedures in the presence of a pathogenic mutation. Targeting gene hot spot areas for mutation analysis is a useful strategy to maximize the success of molecular diagnosis for individuals with craniosynostosis. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Classic clinical features include patchy hypoplastic skin, split hand/foot deformities, and ocular malformations. We aimed to refine the understanding of the phenotypic spectrum and natural history of this disorder and now present multi‐disciplinary clinical description and medical history review for 18 patients with focal dermal hypoplasia. All disease characteristics were analyzed and compiled in aggregate to aid in development of clinical diagnostic criteria. Medical history data unexpectedly revealed that the majority of patients (87%) had undergone tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea, which exposed an important co‐morbidity that is not well described in the literature, but managing physicians should be made aware of. Fifteen of the 18 patients underwent molecular sequencing of PORCN to detect heterozygous or mosaic mutations. Where no mutation was detected, we performed exon‐targeted chromosomal microarray to evaluate for large deletions of the PORCN gene region. We detected a pathogenic genotype in 14 of 15 patients, including one novel chromosomal deletion and four novel PORCN sequence variants.

MAP3K1 encodes a signal transduction regulator in the sex determination pathway and is emerging as one of the more common genes responsible for 46,XY DSD presenting as complete or partial gonadal dysgenesis. Clinical assessment, endocrine evaluation, and genetic analysis were performed in six individuals from four unrelated families with 46,XY DSD. All six individuals were found to have likely pathogenic MAP3K1 variants. Three of these individuals presented with complete gonadal dysgenesis, characterized by bilateral streak gonads with typical internal and external female genitalia, while the other three presented with partial gonadal dysgenesis, characterized by incomplete testicular development, resulting in clitoral hypertrophy with otherwise typical female external genitalia. Testing for MAP3K1 variants should be considered in patients with 46,XY complete or partial gonadal dysgenesis, particularly in families with multiple members affected with 46,XY DSD.

The recent identification of molecular etiologies has served to effectively characterize a large set of patients who have been described with Coffin-Siris between the time of its initial description and the present. However, despite recent advances, a number of patients who traditionally fit the diagnosis have yet to have identified causes. This could be due to patients who lie outside the defined phenotype, or alternatively, to additional as yet unidentified genes which may play roles. Here we outline the range of clinical features described in the broader diagnostic category, review the continuing phenotypic challenges and note those subsets of patients for whom molecular causes have yet to be clarified.

Constitutional gene disorders, somatic gene disorders and imprinting dysregulation are each considered. The constitutional overgrowth genes discussed include NSD1 , EZH2 , GPC3 , DIS3L2 , and PTEN whilst the somatic overgrowth genes include AKT3 , PIK3R2 , and PIK3CA . Abnormalities of imprinting, exemplified by disruption of the (epi)genetic regulation of the imprinted 11p15 gene cluster, constitutes the final section of this issue. Many of the genes discussed in this issue encode components of the PI3K/mTOR growth regulatory pathway. This signaling cascade consists of dual, parallel branches, anchored by the serine–threonine kinase, mTOR, and has diverse downstream effects including inhibition of apoptosis, activation of protein synthesis, and enhanced cell survival. Activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway promotes growth whereas inhibition, or abrogation, results in decreased cellular growth. Despite the rapid advances of the last decade, there is still an enormous amount to discover. We hope that some of the work reviewed in this issue will facilitate the next decade's discoveries and we look forward to a 10 years as productive as the last. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We reviewed all published information on the clinical trials that have been completed as well as the publicly available information on ongoing trials of therapies in AS. To date, all clinical trials that strove to improve neurodevelopment in AS have been unsuccessful. Attempts at hypermethylating the maternal locus through dietary compounds were ineffective. The results of an 8‐week open‐label trial using minocycline as a matrix metalloproteinase‐9 inhibitor were inconclusive, while a subsequent randomized placebo‐controlled trial suggested that treatment with minocycline for 8 weeks did not result in any neurodevelopmental gains. A 1‐year randomized placebo‐controlled trial using levodopa to alter the phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase II did not lead to any improvement in neurodevelopment. Topoisomerase inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides are being developed to directly inhibit UBE3A‐AS . Artificial transcription factors are being developed to “super activate” UBE3A or inhibit UBE3A‐AS . Other strategies targeting specific pathways are briefly discussed. We also reviewed the medications that are currently used to treat seizures and sleep disturbances, which are two of the more common complications of AS. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Goltz syndrome, caused by mutations in PORCN , is an X‐linked dominant ectodermal dysplasia which is also known as focal dermal hypoplasia. This name is derived from the predominant pathologic skin findings of the syndrome. Nineteen Goltz‐affected participants attended a multidisciplinary scientific and clinical conference convened by the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasia which allowed further characterization of the features of this very rare condition. At birth, the affected areas of skin are typically erythematous and fragile. The hallmark cutaneous features, which vary widely due to mosacism and X‐inactivation, include the previously described skin changes of asymmetric Blaschko‐linear and reticulated atrophy, pigmentary changes, and telangectasias. Lipomatous changes and papillomas as characteristically defined were reported in the majority of patients. A newly recognized skin finding was progressive hyperpigmented freckling that occurred within the hypopigmented areas which were noted to be photosensitive. Many patients also had a pebbly texture to the central face, dorsal hands and feet. Punctate erosions within the atrophic areas and hypohidrosis were also common. Most had patchy alopecia and many had diffusely thin hair. Scanning electron microscopy of the hair shafts revealed abnormalities in the majority of participants with several different features identified, including atrophic hairs with reduced diameters, markedly flattened hairs as noted in cross‐sectional views, trichorrhexis nodosa, pili torti, and pili trianguli et canaliculi. Nail changes included V‐nicking and longitudinal ridging of the nail plate, in addition to micronychia. Early recognition of the dermatologic features, in addition to the variable but universal limb anomalies, of Goltz syndrome will allow early and accurate diagnosis without the need for extensive diagnostic studies, while also allowing for accurate prognosis and appropriate genetic counseling. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This series consists of 10 papers focused on three main topics, namely (i) assessment and differential diagnosis of children and adults with gJHM, (ii) systematic presentation of selected key non-articular manifestations of JHS/EDS-HT and actual perception of physiotherapy as the best therapeutic resource for this condition, and (iii) exploration of the available knowledge relating \"congenital laxity of tissues\" to various dysfunctions of the nervous system during development and adulthood.

This is a retrospective review of all array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH/ array CGH) findings ascertained in two major prenatal and postnatal genetic diagnostic centers in Hong Kong from June 2012 to December 2017. Medical records were reviewed for cases with pathogenic and variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). Classification of copy number variants (CNVs) was based on current knowledge and experience by August 2018. The aims of this review are to study the diagnostic yield of array CGH application in prenatal and postnatal settings in Hong Kong and to describe the spectrum of abnormalities found. Prenatal indications included abnormal ultrasound findings, positive Down syndrome screening, abnormal noninvasive prenatal test results, advanced maternal age and family history of chromosomal or genetic abnormalities. Postnatal indications included unexplained DD, ID, ASD, and MCA. A total of 1,261 prenatal subjects and 3,096 postnatal patients were reviewed. The prenatal diagnostic yield of pathogenic CNV and VUS (excluding those detectable by karyotype) was 3.5%. The postnatal diagnostic yield of pathogenic CNV was 15.2%. The detection rates for well‐defined microdeletion and microduplication syndromes were 4.6% in prenatal and 6.1% (1 in 16 index patients) in postnatal cases, respectively. Chromosomes 15, 16, and 22 accounted for over 21 and 25% of pathogenic CNVs detected in prenatal and postnatal cohorts, respectively.

FHH elements : 8 FHH elements lead to 37.3% of the increased risk categorizations (by frequency): first‐degree‐relative (FDR) with polyps age ≥60 (7.1%, N = 85), three relatives with Lynch‐related cancers (5.4%, N = 65), FDR with polyps age &lt;60 (5.1%, N = 61), three relatives on same side of family with same cancer (4.9%, N = 59), Gail score ≥1.66% (4.9%, N = 58), two relatives with breast cancer (one ≤age 50) (4.1%, N = 49), one relative with breast cancer ≤age 40 (4.1%, N = 48), FDR with colon cancer age ≥60 (1.7%, N = 20). MeTree identifies a high percentage of individuals in the general primary care population needing non‐routine risk management/prevention for the selected conditions. Implementing risk‐stratification in primary care will likely increase demand for related‐resources, particularly colon screening and GC. Understanding the prevalence of FHH elements helps predict resource needs and may aid in guideline development. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurocutaneous autosomal‐dominant genetic syndrome marked by development of hamartomatous lesions arising from dysfunction of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although TSC remains a heterogeneous clinical entity, the recent inclusion of genetic diagnostic criteria reflects advancement in our understanding of its underlying etiopathogenesis. Abnormal cellular growth, differentiation, and migration result in multisystem sequelae, with neurologic manifestations of TSC representing the primary cause of morbidity and mortality for the majority of individuals. Modern imaging techniques aid in the diagnosis of TSC and guide treatment strategies by revealing central nervous system findings. Cortical tubers are the namesake lesion of the disorder and occur in up to 90% of cases, often exerting significant epileptogenic potential. Subependymal nodules are found in 80% of patients as calcified tumors lining the ependyma of the lateral ventricles. In some cases, these nodules are thought to progress to subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and may present with obstructive hydrocephalus. Retinal astrocytic hamartomas are also common, present in 50% of patients. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for large or symptomatic lesions, though clinical trials have highlighted a potential role for mTOR pathway antagonism. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary for achieving optimal patient outcomes.",

Epilepsy affects 90% of the patients and appears in the first 2 years of life in the majority of them. Early onset of epilepsy in the first 12 months of life is associated with high risk of cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric problems including autism. Prenatal or early infantile diagnosis of TSC, before the onset of epilepsy, provides a unique opportunity to monitor EEG before the onset of clinical seizures, thus enabling early intervention in the process of epileptogenesis.

We also identified a gap in literature when reviewing all guidelines and recommendations, and we propose a guideline for neuroradiological evaluation of patients with CHARGE syndrome. This is of importance, as patients with CHARGE are at risk for peri‐anesthetic complications, making recurrent imaging procedures under anesthesia a particular risk in clinical practice. However, comprehensive cranial imaging is also of tremendous value for timely diagnosis, proper treatment of symptoms and for further research into CHARGE syndrome.

The first clinical sign is often reduced fetal movement and/or contractures, as seen on prenatal ultrasounds. This can be apparent at any point, from early to late pregnancy, may range from mild to severe involvement, with or without associated other structural anomalies. Possible etiologies and their prognosis need to be interpreted with respect to developmental timing. The etiology of AMC is highly heterogeneous and making the specific diagnosis will guide prognosis, counseling and prenatal and perinatal management. Current ultrasound practice identifies only approximately 25% of individuals with arthrogryposis prenatally before 24 weeks of pregnancy in a general obstetrics care population. There are currently no studies and guidelines that address the question of when and how to assess for fetal contractures and movements during pregnancy. The failure to identify fetuses with arthrogryposis before 24 weeks of pregnancy means that physicians and families are denied reproductive options and interventions that may improve outcome. We review current practice and recommend adjusting the current prenatal imaging and genetic diagnostic strategies to achieve early prenatal detection and etiologic diagnosis. We suggest exploring options for in utero therapy to increase fetal movement for ongoing pregnancies.",

Aicardi syndrome only affects females, with the exception of a few males with a 47, XXY chromosome constitution. All cases are de novo and the only cases of definitive recurrence in families are in identical twins. It is now recognized that individuals with Aicardi syndrome commonly exhibit a variety of other neuronal migration defects, eye anomalies, and other somatic features, including skin, skeletal, and craniofacial systems. The etiology of Aicardi syndrome remains unknown despite an international effort exploring different genetic mechanisms. Although various technologies examining candidate genes, copy number variation, skewing of X-chromosome inactivation, and whole-exome sequences have been explored, no strong genetic candidates have been identified to date. New technologies that can detect low-level mosaicism and balanced rearrangements, as well as platforms examining changes at the DNA and chromatin level affecting regulatory regions are all potential avenues for future studies that may one day solve the mystery of the etiology of Aicardi syndrome.",

The majority of patients with CHD have an isolated heart defect without other organ system involvement, but the genetic basis of isolated CHD has been even more difficult to elucidate compared to syndromic CHD. Our understanding of the genetics of isolated CHD is advancing in large part due to advances in next generation sequencing, and the list of genes associated with CHD is rapidly expanding. Variants in hundreds of genes have been identified that may cause or contribute to CHD, but a genetic cause can still only be identified in about 20-30% of patients. Identifying a genetic cause for CHD can have an impact on clinical outcomes and prognosis and thus it is important for clinicians to understand when and what to test in patients with isolated CHD. This chapter reviews some of the known genetic mechanisms that contribute to isolated inherited and sporadic CHD as well as recommendations for evaluation and genetic testing in patients with isolated CHD.",

The condition leads to hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and ever since the condition was described approximately 80 years ago, testosterone treatment has been the cornerstone in care for individuals with KS. However, KS is associated with an array of health-related and socioeconomic challenges and it is becoming progressively clear that proper care for boys and men with KS reaches far beyond simply supplementing with testosterone. There are no widely implemented guidelines for KS care, and studies investigating crucial aspects of testosterone treatment in individuals with KS, including both beneficial and potentially adverse effects, have only begun to emerge during the last decades. For this descriptive review, we present an overview of literature describing health-related outcomes of testosterone treatment in KS and outline the clinical applications of testosterone treatment in KS. Collectively, beneficial effects of testosterone treatment on overall health in KS are described with few apparent adverse effects. However, larger randomized studies in adult and pediatric patients are warranted to elucidate key aspects of treatment. We stress the implementation of centralized multidisciplinary clinics and the need for a dedicated international guideline to ensure optimal care of boys and men with KS.",

This review summarizes what is known about early neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and medical manifestations in young children with SCT. We focus on recent research and unanswered questions related to the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders that commonly present in the first years of life and discuss the medical and endocrine manifestations of SCT at this young age. The increasing rate of prenatal SCT diagnoses provides the opportunity to address gaps in the existing literature in a new birth cohort, leading to development of the eXtraordinarY Babies Study. This study aims to better describe and compare the natural history of SCT conditions, identify predictors of positive and negative outcomes in SCT, evaluate developmental and autism screening measures commonly used in primary care practices for the SCT population, and build a rich data set linked to a bank of biological samples for future study. Results from this study and ongoing international research efforts will inform evidence‐based care and improve health and neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 47,XXX (triple X) and Turner syndrome (45,X) are sex chromosomal abnormalities with detrimental effects on health with increased mortality and morbidity. In karyotypical normal females, X‐chromosome inactivation balances gene expression between sexes and upregulation of the X chromosome in both sexes maintain stoichiometry with the autosomes. In 47,XXX and Turner syndrome a gene dosage imbalance may ensue from increased or decreased expression from the genes that escape X inactivation, as well as from incomplete X chromosome inactivation in 47,XXX. We aim to study genome‐wide DNA‐methylation and RNA‐expression changes can explain phenotypic traits in 47,XXX syndrome. We compare DNA‐methylation and RNA‐expression data derived from white blood cells of seven women with 47,XXX syndrome, with data from seven female controls, as well as with seven women with Turner syndrome (45,X). To address these questions, we explored genome‐wide DNA‐methylation and transcriptome data in blood from seven females with 47,XXX syndrome, seven females with Turner syndrome, and seven karyotypically normal females (46,XX). Based on promoter methylation, we describe a demethylation of six X‐chromosomal genes ( AMOT , HTR2C , IL1RAPL2 , STAG2 , TCEANC , ZNF673 ), increased methylation for GEMIN8 , and four differentially methylated autosomal regions related to four genes ( SPEG , MUC4 , SP6 , and ZNF492 ). We illustrate how these changes seem compensated at the transcriptome level although several genes show differential exon usage. In conclusion, our results suggest an impact of the supernumerary X chromosome in 47,XXX syndrome on the methylation status of selected genes despite an overall comparable expression profile.",

This diversity also applies to the newborn screening (NBS) activities, as demonstrated by the start dates and modalities of implementation as organized programs, the panel of diseases screened for, the available technologies for testing, the coverage, the legislation in force, and the degree of development and success reached. Based on these characteristics, Latin American countries can currently be classified into five groups ranging from fully established national programs to no program at all. Sixteen countries have national or regional NBS programs, but up to date only 14 are actively working. The other 2 have organized programs conducted by different health services providers, but without any unified national coordination. Only six countries have coverage ≥ 90% and 12 ≥ 70%. Thirteen countries have legislation in force defining NBS as mandatory. The 16 countries that have active NBS programs screen for congenital hypothyroidism, 14 for phenylketonuria, 12 for congenital adrenal hyperplasia and cystic fibrosis, and 8 for galactosemia. NBS by tandem mass spectrometry is implemented at a national level only in two countries. Despite these disparities, sustained and significant growth has become evident in the last decade, highlighted by the implementation of new programs, the increase in coverage, the expansion of the panel diseases, the enactment of new NBS laws, and the increasing involvement of government and public health authorities.",

This heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders is typically characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and generalized connective tissue fragility. Most EDS types are caused by genetic defects that affect connective tissue biosynthesis, thereby compromising collagen biosynthesis or fibrillogenesis and resulting in a disorganized extracellular matrix. Even though chronic pain is a major source of disability, functional impairment, and psychosocial suffering in EDS, currently used analgesics and other treatment strategies provide inadequate pain relief and thus represents an important unmet medical need. An important contributor to this is the lack of knowledge about the underlying mechanisms. In this narrative review, we summarize the current understanding of pain and the associated mechanisms in EDS based on clinical studies focusing on questionnaires and experimental pain testing as well as studies in animal models of EDS. In addition, we highlight the challenges, gaps, and opportunities in EDS‐pain research.",

    "abstract": "In the US, newborn screening (NBS) is a unique health program that supports health equity and screens virtually every baby after birth, and has brought timely treatments to babies since the 1960's. With the decreasing cost of sequencing and the improving methods to interpret genetic data, there is an opportunity to add DNA sequencing as a screening method to facilitate the identification of babies with treatable conditions that cannot be identified in any other scalable way, including highly penetrant genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). However, the lack of effective dietary or drug-based treatments has made it nearly impossible to consider NDDs in the current NBS framework, yet it is anticipated that any treatment will be maximally effective if started early. Hence there is a critical need for large scale pilot studies to assess if and how NDDs can be effectively screened at birth, if parents desire that information, and what impact early diagnosis may have. Here we attempt to provide an overview of the recent advances in NDD treatments, explore the possible framework of setting up a pilot study to genetically screen for NDDs, highlight key technical, practical, and ethical considerations and challenges, and examine the policy and health system implications.",

Utilizing the concept of a carousel that represents the four broad time periods when critical decisions might be made around genetic diagnoses during a person's lifetime, we describe genetic testing during the prenatal period, the newborn period, childhood, and adulthood. For each of these periods, we describe the objectives of genetic testing, the current status of screening or testing, the near‐term vision for the future of genomic testing, the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and the feasibility and ethical considerations of testing and treating. The notion of a “Genomics Passbook” is one where an early genomic screening evaluation could be performed on each individual through a public health program, with that data ultimately serving as a “living document” that could be queried and/or reanalyzed at prescribed times during the lifetime of that person, or in response to concerns about symptoms of a genetic disorder in that individual.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hereditary paraganglioma (PGL) is characterized by the development of slow‐growing and vascularized tumors in the paraganglionic system. PGL is caused by germ line heterozygous inactivating mutations in the SDHB ( PGL4 ), SDHC ( PGL3 ), or SDHD ( PGL1 ) genes, which encode three of the four subunits of mitochondrial complex II (succinate dehydrogenase; SDH). Common tumor sites include the carotid body in the neck and paraganglia in the abdomen. The risk of tumor development associated with SDHD mutations is determined by the sex of the transmitting parent, because only a paternal transmission leads to tumorigenesis in the progeny. This transmission pattern suggests operation of genomic imprinting on the SDHD gene. There is also evidence that the risk of tumor development increases at higher altitudes among SDHD mutation carriers. Accordingly, the increased prevalence of SDHD mutations in the Netherlands, attributable to multiple founder mutations, has been explained in part by the low altitudes in this country, which presumably reduce gene penetrance and relax the natural selection. Thus, PGL caused by SDHD mutations represents an unusual example of an inherited monogenic tumor syndrome because the risk of tumorigenesis shows an absolute dependence on the sex of the transmitting parent and may be modified by a ubiquitous environmental factor. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This review describes what is currently known about the genetics of prostate cancer. Traditionally, the genetics of a suspected inherited cancer predisposition have generally been thought of in terms of a single, high‐risk gene with a dominant mode of inheritance. Such a gene might be observed in families, as has been documented in familial breast cancer ( BRCA1/2 ), familial colorectal cancer (HNPCC), retinoblastoma ( RB1 ), and Wilms tumor ( WT1 ). This review investigates the evidence for the existence, first of familial prostate cancer, and second, for the presence of such a high‐risk gene in those families by epidemiological and experimental approaches. Another current area of interest in prostate cancer is the investigation of the contribution of common lower penetrance genes to the disease. This alternative approach has become popular, as it raises the issue of frequently seen genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) having relevance to the risk of developing the disease. Finally, this article will explore the way forward, with emphasis on worldwide collaboration from teams attempting to find the genes responsible for the disease and investment in new technologies that will aid in their discovery. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Genetic testing (predictive analysis that determines genetic alterations in individuals for clinical purposes) and screening (programs that identify persons within a subpopulation who may be at a higher risk for a genetic disease or condition) are increasingly utilized to promote and improve the public's health. The proliferate use of genetic testing and screening may improve public health outcomes, but it also implicates significant ethical, legal, and social concerns. Within the context of conflicting ethical values from the individual and public health perspectives, individual values such as informed consent and privacy and discrimination protections must be respected. Legal and ethical attempts to exceptionalize genetic tests and information (as compared to other health information) to protect privacy and prevent discrimination are well intended, but can also be unjust and impractical. Respect for individual ethical rights has limits. Principles of public health ethics justify voluntary genetic testing and screening and sharing of data for population‐based health purposes. Thus, individual rights should not always trump the use of genetic tests or screening programs (or information derived therefrom) for legitimate public health purposes. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Accordingly, the presented paper will attempt to tackle the genetics behind suicidal behavior from the perspective of the populational genetics. First, the variability of suicide rates across Europe is discussed. This is followed by a brief discussion of the J curve (on a map of Europe, the countries with a higher suicide rate form a so‐called J curve, which starts in Finland and extends down to Slovenia), which maps on to the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, representing the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion. Furthermore, we will discuss whether the group of people living within the J‐curve could share genes, which may not tolerate excessive amounts alcohol, the combination of which is more likely to end in suicidal behavior. Further along we list possible ways in which suicidal behaviour could have been selected for genetically in populations and identify those specific populations in which it may have appeared. Finally, we point at other locations in the world where a similar interplay of genes and environment has probably occurred, Greenland being the best example of the malignant interaction of alcohol consumption and the trait‐like characteristics, which might constitute the vulnerability to suicidal behaviour. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Although they differ in clinical features, inheritance, and structural and biochemical abnormalities of the epidermis, they often pose a diagnostic challenge. For each of the 12 ichthyoses and related disorders described here, the major disease genes have been identified and genotype–phenotype correlation have begun to emerge. The molecular findings reveal the functional importance and interactions of many different epidermal proteins and metabolic pathways, including major structural proteins (keratins, loricrin), enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (transglutaminase 1, lipoxygenases, fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, steroid sulfatase, glucocerebrosidase, Δ8‐Δ7 sterol isomerase, 3β‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), and protein catabolism (LEKTI), peroxisomal transport and processing (Peroxin 7 receptor, Phytanoyl‐CoA hydroxylase) and DNA repair (proteins of the transcription repair complex). This review highlights the spectacular advances in the molecular genetics and biology of heritable ichthyoses over the past decade.

Nevertheless, medical treatment with bisphosphonates can bring significant additional improvements. Benefits include decreased pain, lower fracture incidence, and better mobility. Among the various bisphosphonates, intravenous pamidronate has been studied in most detail. It is unclear whether oral bisphosphonates are as effective as intravenous pamidronate. As the effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton is largest during growth, it appears logical to start medical therapy of OI patients as early as possible. However, the optimal treatment regimen and the long-term consequences of pamidronate treatment in children are currently unknown. Given these uncertainties, treatment with bisphosphonates during growth should be reserved for patients who have significant clinical problems, such as vertebral compression fractures or long bone deformities. Medical therapies other than bisphosphonates, such as growth hormone and parathyroid hormone, play a minor role at present. Gene-based therapy currently remains in the early stages of preclinical research.",

Although the majority of diaphragmatic hernias occur as isolated malformations, additional major and minor anomalies are common and are present in more than 40% of patients. There are compelling data for the importance of genetic factors in the etiology of CDH, but the pathogenesis and the causative genes for CDH in humans remain elusive. There are more than 70 syndromes in which diaphragmatic hernias have been described, and several of these syndromes are single gene disorders for which the gene is known. One method for identifying the causative genes in isolated CDH is to study syndromes with known genes in which CDH is a recognized feature, with the rationale that those genes have a role in diaphragm development. This review discusses the syndromes that are most commonly associated with CDH, with greater attention towards syndromes in which the causative genes have been identified, including Simpson‐Golabi‐Behmel syndrome, Denys‐Drash syndrome, spondylocostal dysostosis, craniofrontonasal syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Marfan syndrome. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies addressing etiologic yield in childhood developmental disabilities have mainly looked at individuals with developmental delay/mental retardation. The few studies addressing the question of etiologic yield in patients with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) had a major drawback, in that the enrolled subjects were diagnosed as having the autistic spectrum disorders based only on history and clinical examination, and/or on unspecified instruments. In addition, only some of these patients underwent a complete laboratory evaluation. To investigate the etiologic yield of PDDs, we undertook a large prospective study on subjects selected according to very strict criteria and diagnosed as having PDD based on the present “gold standard” (ADI‐R and ADOS‐G), and a clinical diagnosis made by a child psychiatrist. Eighty‐five (85) patients with PDD and their first degree relatives participated in this study. These patients were selected from a sample of 236 subjects who had received a clinical diagnosis of PDD at the Stella Maris Institute between March 2002 and 2005. Selection criteria for entering the study were: (1) a diagnosis of PDD (with exclusion of the Rett syndrome) confirmed after the administration of the ADI‐R (autism diagnostic interview‐revised) and the ADOS‐G (autism diagnostic observation schedule‐generic). In addition, a clinical diagnosis was made by the child psychiatrist, on the basis of presence or absence of DSM‐IV symptoms of autism; (2) chronological age between 4 and 18 years; (3) IQ&gt;30; (4) availability of both biologic parents. Patients, 65/85 (76.5%), had autism, 18/85 (21.2%) had PDD‐NOS, and the remaining 2/85 (2.3%) had Asperger syndrome. Ages varied between 4 years 2 months and 12 years 5 months (mean 7.6 years), and there was a marked male preponderance (68/85). All subjects underwent various laboratory studies and neuroimaging. With respect to possible etiologic determination, a detailed history and physical examination in this group of patients with PDD was informative in 10.5% (9/85). HRB karyotype was diagnostic in one, and molecular fragile X studies in one child. Brain MRI was informative in two children (2.3%) with relative macrocrania but no neurological features; and EEG was helpful in one child, identifying a Landau–Kleffner disorder. Audiometry and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) showed a bilateral sensorineural loss in another child. Metabolic evaluation gave normal results in all subjects. The results suggest an evaluation paradigm with reference to etiologic determination for individuals with PDDs that does not presently justify metabolic or neuroimaging on a screening basis. Recurrence risk, treatment implications, and significant and long‐lasting emotional relief for the parents suggest that serious consideration be given to clinical genetic examination, genetic testing, EEG study (during wakefulness and sleep), and audiometry, despite a relatively low yield. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is increasingly clear that medical genetics has broad relevance in adult clinical medicine. More adult patients with genetic conditions are being recognized, genetic testing for adult‐onset genetic conditions is expanding, and children with genetic conditions are now more likely to survive to adulthood. While the number of patients who could benefit from medical genetic services increases, adult care providers are less well educated about clinical genetics and are not sufficiently prepared to meet the growing needs of this population. Genetics professionals may also be ill‐suited for this challenge, since geneticists and genetic counselors have traditionally had greater experience in pediatric and prenatal settings. Communication between primary care physicians who treat adults and the genetics community is currently suboptimal and the identification and subsequent referral of adult patients for genetic services need improvement. Finally, published guidelines that address how to deliver genetic services to adult patients are unavailable for many genetic conditions. In this article we address the challenges of transitioning genetics services from traditional, and largely pediatric‐based models to paradigms that can best address the needs of adult patients with genetic conditions. Potential solutions and the practicality of implementation of a team‐based approach to adult genetic medicine, including the application of genetic counseling, are also discussed. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

In this article, we review our current understanding of diaphragmatic embryogenesis including the origin of diaphragmatic tissue. We use rodent models to review the muscularization of the diaphragm and review selected genetic models of abnormal muscularization. We also review models of posterior diaphragmatic defects and discuss evidence for the pleuroperitoneal fold (PPF) tissue contributing to the diaphragm. Finally, we discuss models of anterior and central hernias. It may be simplistic to subdivide this review based on anatomic regions of the diaphragm, as evidence is emerging that defects in different regions of the diaphragm in humans and in mice may be etiologically related. However, at this time we do not have enough knowledge to make more mechanistic or genetic classifications though with time, genetic progress in the field of diaphragm development will allow us to do this.",

The poor prognosis in the most severe forms justifies the importance of genetic counseling in affected families. The genetic counseling requires a thorough clinical approach given the extreme variability of phenotype and etiology. The karyotype is an essential diagnostic tool. Since mutations in the four major genes (SHH, ZIC2, SIX3, and TGIF) have been identified in HPE patients, molecular study is performed routinely in nonsyndromic HPE. New molecular tools, such as array-CGH analysis, are now part of the diagnostic process. Prenatal diagnosis is based primarily on fetal imaging, but \"molecular\" prenatal diagnosis can be performed if a mutation has been previously identified in a proband. Interpretations of molecular diagnosis must be given with caution, given the lack of strict genotype-phenotype correlation, and should be offered in addition to fetal imaging, using ultrasound followed by fetal MRI. We report on our experience of 15 molecular prenatal diagnoses from chorionic villi or amniotic fluid sampling. In eight instances, we were able to reassure the parents after taking into account the absence of the mutation in the fetus, previously identified before in a parent and/or a proband. Fetal RMI was normal later in pregnancy, and no child had medical problems after birth. The mutation was found in the seven other cases: four children were born, either without brain malformation and asymptomatic, or had a less severe form than the index case.",

Two hundred seventy CDH patients were ascertained, carefully phenotyped, and classified as isolated (diaphragm defects alone) or complex (with additional anomalies) cases. We established different strategies to reveal CDH‐critical chromosome loci and genes in humans. Candidate genes for sequencing analyses were selected from CDH animal models, genetic intervals of recurrent chromosomal aberration in humans, such as 15q26.1–q26.2 or 1q41–q42.12, as well as genes in the retinoic acid and related pathways and those known to be involved in embryonic lung development. For instance, FOG2 , GATA4 , and COUP‐TFII are all needed for both normal diaphragm and lung development and are likely all in the same genetic and molecular pathway. Linkage analysis was applied first in a large inbred family and then in four multiplex families with Donnai–Barrow syndrome (DBS) associated with CDH. 10K SNP chip and microsatellite markers revealed a DBS locus on chromosome 2q23.3–q31.1. We applied array‐based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) techniques to over 30, mostly complex, CDH patients and found a de novo microdeletion in a patient with Fryns syndrome related to CDH. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification (MLPA) techniques allowed us to further define the deletion interval. Our aim is to identify genetic intervals and, in those, to prioritize genes that might reveal molecular pathways, mutations in any step of which, might contribute to the same phenotype.

    "abstract": "Abstract Williams syndrome (WS) is a multisystem disorder caused by deletion of about 1.55 Mb of DNA (including 26 genes) on chromosome 7q11.23, a region predisposed to recombination due to its genomic structure. Deletion of the Williams syndrome chromosome region (WSCR) occurs sporadically. To better define chance for familial recurrence and to investigate the prevalence of genomic rearrangements of the region, 257 children with WS and their parents were studied. We determined deletion size in probands by metaphase FISH, parent‐of‐origin of the deleted chromosome by molecular genetic methods, and inversion status of the WSCR in both parents by interphase FISH. The frequency of WSCR inversion in the transmitting parent group was 24.9%. In contrast, the rate of inversion in the non‐transmitting parent group (a reasonable estimate of the rate in the general population) was 5.8%. There were no significant gender differences with respect to parent‐of‐origin for the deleted chromosome or the incidence of the inversion polymorphism. There was no difference in the rate of spontaneous abortion for mothers heterozygous for the WSCR inversion relative to mothers without the inversion. We calculate that for a parent heterozygous for a WSCR inversion, the chance to have a child with WS is about 1 in 1,750, in contrast to the 1 in 9,500 chance for a parent without an inversion. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the epidemiology of congenital amelia (absence of limb/s), using the largest series of cases known to date. Data were gathered by 20 surveillance programs on congenital anomalies, all International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research members, from all continents but Africa, from 1968 to 2006, depending on the program. Reported clinical information on cases was thoroughly reviewed to identify those strictly meeting the definition of amelia. Those with amniotic bands or limb-body wall complex were excluded. The primary epidemiological analyses focused on isolated cases and those with multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). A total of 326 amelia cases were ascertained among 23,110,591 live births, stillbirths and (for some programs) elective terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomalies. The overall total prevalence was 1.41 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.57). Only China Beijing and Mexico RYVEMCE had total prevalences, which were significantly higher than this overall total prevalence. Some under-registration could influence the total prevalence in some programs. Liveborn cases represented 54.6% of total. Among monomelic cases (representing 65.2% of nonsyndromic amelia cases), both sides were equally involved, and the upper limbs (53.9%) were slightly more frequently affected. One of the most interesting findings was a higher prevalence of amelia among offspring of mothers younger than 20 years. Sixty-nine percent of the cases had MCA or syndromes. The most frequent defects associated with amelia were other types of musculoskeletal defects, intestinal, some renal and genital defects, oral clefts, defects of cardiac septa, and anencephaly.",

Examination of the development of the quasi-mandated screening program for beta-thalassemia in the Republic of Cyprus (1970-1984) demonstrates that there is nothing eugenic about modern genetic screening practices. The Cypriot screening program involves mandated premarital carrier screening, voluntary prenatal diagnosis (originally through fetoscopy, now through CVS), and voluntary termination of afflicted pregnancies-all at public expense. In the Republic of Cyprus, the mandating agency for genetic screening is the established church, so this examination also demonstrates that religious authorities with profound objections to abortion can balance that moral precept against others, such as the imperative to reduce suffering that sometimes conflict with it.",

A total of 22,740,933 live births, stillbirths and, for some programs, elective terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (ETOPFA) were monitored. After a detailed review of clinical data, only true phocomelia cases were included. Descriptive data are presented and additional analyses compared isolated cases with those with multiple congenital anomalies (MCA), excluding syndromes. We also briefly compared congenital anomalies associated with nonsyndromic phocomelia with those presented with amelia, another rare severe congenital limb defect. A total of 141 phocomelia cases registered gave an overall total prevalence of 0.62 per 100,000 births (95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.73). Three programs (Australia Victoria, South America ECLAMC, Italy North East) had significantly different prevalence estimates. Most cases (53.2%) had isolated phocomelia, while 9.9% had syndromes. Most nonsyndromic cases were monomelic (55.9%), with an excess of left (64.9%) and upper limb (64.9%) involvement. Most nonsyndromic cases (66.9%) were live births; most isolated cases (57.9%) weighed more than 2,499 g; most MCA (60.7%) weighed less than 2,500 g, and were more likely stillbirths (30.8%) or ETOPFA (15.4%) than isolated cases. The most common associated defects were musculoskeletal, cardiac, and intestinal. Epidemiological differences between phocomelia and amelia highlighted possible differences in their causes.",

    "abstract": "A standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered to 28 adults with Williams syndrome (WS). Three quarters of the WS subjects showed abnormal glucose curves, meeting diagnostic criteria for either diabetes or the pre-diabetic state of impaired glucose tolerance. Fasting mean glucose and median insulin levels did not differ significantly in the total WS cohort versus age-gender-BMI matched controls, though the glucose area under the curve was greater in the WS subjects. HbA1c levels were not as reliable as the OGTT in diagnosing the presence of diabetes. Given the high prevalence of impaired glucose regulation, adults with WS should be screened for diabetes, and when present should be treated in accordance with standard medical practice. Hemizygosity for a gene mapping to the Williams syndrome chromosome region (WSCR) is likely the major factor responsible for the high frequency of diabetes in WS. Syntaxin-1A is a prime candidate gene based on its location in the WSCR, its role in insulin release, and the presence of abnormal glucose metabolism in mouse models with aberrantly expressed Stx-1a.",

It is due to the presence of a supernumerary marker chromosome formed by the inverted duplication of proximal chromosome 15, resulting in tetrasomy 15p and partial tetrasomy 15q, and containing the Prader–Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region (PWS/ASCR). The vast majority of these idic(15) derives from the two homologous maternal chromosomes at meiosis. To better define the behavior profile, we studied 22 idic(15) children (15 males and 7 females) observed at our institute between 1986 and 2010, and present, in detail, case studies of five of them. We have been able to perform standardized and semi‐standardized measures of intelligence, and psychopathology in only 13 of our 22 patients, due to the limitations of chronological age, and to the severity of ID (ranging from mild–moderate, in 15%, to severe–profound, in 85% of our sample). The results show a distinct developmental profile in idic(15) patients, that may provide a behavioral signature for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)/ASD‐like arising from the susceptibility locus on proximal 15q; and suggest that idic(15) individuals are not “true autistic,” but distinct “autistic‐like” persons with high score in the third ADOS‐G and ADI‐R area. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Costello syndrome is a rare rasopathy resulting from germline mutations of the proto‐oncogene HRAS . Its phenotype includes severe failure‐to‐thrive, cardiac abnormalities, a predisposition to benign and malignant tumors, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Costello syndrome is associated with cognitive impairment, including intellectual functioning generally in the mild to moderate range of disability, commensurate adaptive functioning, and increased anxiety. Relative strengths have been found for nonverbal fluid reasoning (FR). Gender effects have been reported, with females showing better adaptive functioning across domains. Developmentally, nonverbal skills plateau in late childhood/early adolescence, whereas the rate of vocabulary acquisition may increase in adolescence into early adulthood. Here we review the literature assessing cognitive, adaptive, and behavioral functioning in Costello syndrome, and we provide data from an ongoing longitudinal study. Severity of cognitive impairment may depend upon the specific HRAS mutation, as three individuals with the p.G13C change showed average nonverbal FR skills and borderline‐to‐low average overall nonverbal IQ. Further, separation anxiety is more common in Costello syndrome than in the general population, affecting 39% of this cohort, and males are more often overly anxious than females. Interrelations between anxiety and cognitive and adaptive functioning were found, pointing to functional difficulties as a likely source of stress and anxiety. Taking into account data from animal models, cognitive and behavioral changes likely originate from abnormal differentiation of neuronal precursor cells, which result in structural and functional brain differences. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

All of the RASopathies exhibit some degree of hypotonia, but CS and CFC are more severe. To determine if individuals with CS and CFC have an underlying skeletal myopathy, we systematically evaluated skeletal muscle pathology in both conditions. We reviewed pathology reports from six individuals who had undergone a skeletal muscle biopsy, and we reviewed histology slides on two cases with CS and one case with CFC. All patients in the cohort had histopathologic findings, and two consistent abnormalities were identified. The first was the presence of abnormal muscle fiber size and variability, and the second was the presence of type 2 fiber predominance. Given the degree of hypotonia typically present in these patients, the overall architecture of the muscle was relatively normal, without showing indications of severe structural histopathology or metabolic abnormalities. Because the Ras/MAPK pathway is vital for skeletal myogenesis, we evaluated the effects of CS and CFC mutations on myogenesis using C2C12 myoblasts. All CS/CFC mutations inhibited myoblast differentiation as indicated by fewer myosin heavy chain expressing cells and a decrease in the number of myotubes as compared to controls. These findings indicate that CS and CFC may have a true myopathy related to an inherent dysregulation of skeletal myogenesis, which further expands our understanding of the consequences of germline Ras/MAPK mutations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The so‐called “enchondromatoses” are skeletal disorders defined by the presence of ectopic cartilaginous tissue within bone tissue. The clinical and radiographic features of the different enchondromatoses are distinct, and grouping them does not reflect a common pathogenesis but simply a similar radiographic appearance and thus the need for a differential diagnosis. Recent advances in the understanding of their molecular and cellular bases confirm the heterogeneous nature of the different enchondromatoses. Some, like Ollier disease, Maffucci disease, metaphyseal chondromatosis with hydroxyglutaric aciduria, and metachondromatosis are produced by a dysregulation of chondrocyte proliferation, while others (such as spondyloenchondrodysplasia or dysspondyloenchondromatosis) are caused by defects in structure or metabolism of cartilage or bone matrix. In other forms (e.g., the dominantly inherited genochondromatoses), the basic defect remains to be determined. The classification, proposed by Spranger and associates in 1978 and tentatively revised twice, was based on the radiographic appearance, the anatomic sites involved, and the mode of inheritance. The new classification proposed here integrates the molecular genetic advances and delineates phenotypic families based on the molecular defects. Reference radiographs are provided to help in the diagnosis of the well‐defined forms. In spite of advances, many cases remain difficult to diagnose and classify, implying that more variants remain to be defined at both the clinical and molecular levels. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Using an advanced MRI protocol and a 1.5‐Tesla magnet, we show radiographic data diagnostic for the holoprosencephaly spectrum, including alobar, semilobar, lobar, middle interhemispheric, and septopreoptic variant. Accurate prenatal evaluation is important because the severity of imaging findings correlates with postnatal morbidity and mortality in holoprosencephaly.

These two conditions, originally considered different disorders, are now accepted as clinically indistinguishable and often segregate as a single‐familial trait. EDS‐HT and JHS are still exclusion diagnoses not supported by any specific laboratory test. Accuracy of clinical diagnosis is, therefore, crucial for appropriate patients' classification and management, but it is actually hampered by the low consistency of many applied criteria including the cutaneous one. We report on mucocutaneous findings in 277 patients with JHS/EDS‐HT with both sexes and various ages. Sixteen objective and five anamnestic items were selected and ascertained in two specialized outpatient clinics. Feature rates were compared by sex and age by a series of statistical tools. Data were also used for a multivariate correspondence analysis with the attempt to identify non‐causal associations of features depicting recognizable phenotypic clusters. Our findings identified a few differences between sexes and thus indicated an attenuated sexual dimorphism for mucocutaneous features in JHS/EDS‐HT. Ten features showed significantly distinct rates at different ages and this evidence corroborated the concept of an evolving phenotype in JHS/EDS‐HT also affecting the skin. Multivariate correspondence analysis identified three relatively discrete phenotypic profiles, which may represent the cutaneous counterparts of the three disease phases previously proposed for JHS/EDS‐HT. These findings could be used for revising the cutaneous criterion in a future consensus for the clinical diagnosis of JHS/EDS‐HT. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Non-accidental injury (NAI) is a major medical concern in the United States. One of the challenges in evaluation of children with unexplained fractures is that genetic forms of bone fragility are one of the differential diagnoses. Infants who present with fractures with mild forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) (OI type I or OI type IV), the most common genetic form of bone disease leading to fractures might be missed if clinical evaluation alone is used to make the diagnosis. Diagnostic clinical features (blue sclera, dentinogenesis imperfecta, Wormian bones on X-rays or positive family history) may not be present or apparent at the age of evaluation. The evaluating clinician faces the decision about whether genetic testing is necessary in certain NAI cases. In this review, we outline clinical presentations of mild OI and review the history of genetic testing for OI in the NAI versus OI setting. We summarize our data of molecular testing in the Collagen Diagnostic Laboratory (CDL) from 2008 to 2014 where NAI was noted on the request for DNA sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2. We provide recommendations for molecular testing in the NAI versus OI setting. First, DNA sequencing of COL1A1, COL1A2, and IFITM5 simultaneously and duplication/deletion testing is recommended. If a causative variant is not identified, in the absence of a pathologic clinical phenotype, no additional gene testing is indicated. If a VUS is found, parental segregation studies are recommended.",

The literature covers 45 malignancies: 29 were liver cancers, mainly hepatoblastomas found in Japanese females; 13 were kidney tumors, predominantly nephroblastomas; 1 was neuroblastoma; 1 was a Hodgkin disease; and 1 was acute myeloid leukemia in an infant with both trisomy 18 and type 1 neurofibromatosis. No instances of the most frequent malignancies of early life-cerebral tumors, germ cell tumors, or leukemia--are reported in children with pure trisomy 18. Tumor occurrence does not appear to correlate with body weight, tissue growth, or cancer genes mapping to chromosome 18. Importantly, the most recent clinical histories report successful treatment; this raises ethical concerns about cancer treatment in infants with Edwards syndrome. In conclusion, knowledge of the Edwards' syndrome tumor profile will enable better clinical surveillance in at-risk organs (i.e., liver, kidney). This knowledge also provides clues to understanding oncogenesis, including the probably reduced frequency of some neoplasms in infants and children with this genetic condition. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The medical management of infants with the trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 syndromes is challenging and controversial. Both conditions have high neonatal and infant mortality, and surviving children display significant cognitive and motor disabilities. Currently, there exists a tension in the neonatal and perinatal communities regarding care. One view holds that management should consist solely of comfort care, while another opinion recommends offering medical and surgical intervention in appropriate situations. The purpose of this manuscript is to present a model for the care of fetuses and infants with trisomy 13 and 18 during the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal periods. Adopting the pathways approach as a framework, we have identified several pertinent decision points, characterizing the goals of care and the resources needed for the decision points at various times. Additionally, we identified themes surrounding parental and professional experiences. The authors propose a care model for trisomy 13 and 18 that uses shared decision making as its foundational principle and the pathways approach as the method. Our model requires further investigation as a strategy for care in order to render it useful in other complex medical situations. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Abnormalities in neural crest-derived tissues contribute to the etiology of CHARGE syndrome, a complex malformation disorder that encompasses clinical symptoms like coloboma, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, ear anomalies, and deafness. Mutations in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene are causative of CHARGE syndrome and loss-of-function data in different model systems have firmly established a role of CHD7 in neural crest development. Here, we will summarize our current understanding of the function of CHD7 in neural crest development and discuss possible links of CHARGE syndrome to other developmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene CHD7 cause CHARGE syndrome, a rare multi-organ syndromic disorder. Gonadal defects are common in individuals with CHARGE syndrome (seen in ∼60-80% of cases) and represent the letter \"G\" in the CHARGE syndrome acronym. The gonadal defect in CHARGE syndrome results from congenital deficiency of the hypothalamic hormone Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which manifests clinically as pubertal failure and infertility, and biochemically as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (low sex steroid hormone levels with inappropriately normal or low gonadotropin levels). In addition to the gonadal endocrine abnormalities, in a small minority of individuals with CHARGE, additional endocrine defects including growth hormone deficiency, multiple pituitary hormone deficits and primary hypothyroidism may also be seen. CHD7 mutations disrupt the targeting of olfactory axons and the migration of GnRH-synthesizing neurons during embryonic development, resulting in congenital idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and anosmia (or hyposmia), two features that define human Kallmann syndrome. Since Kallmann syndrome is one of the constituent phenotypes within CHARGE, recent studies have investigated the role of CHD7 mutations in individuals with IHH and established that deleterious missense mutations in CHD7 are associated with Kallmann syndrome as well as normosmic form of IHH. These missense mutations affect the ATPase and nucleosome remodeling activities of the CHD7 protein. These observations suggest that CHD7 protein function is critical for the ontogeny of GnRH neurons and neuroendocrine regulation of GnRH secretion.",

We retrospectively studied 18 patients (10 males and 8 females; aged 14 months to 9 years) with full trisomy 18 and epilepsy. All patients underwent comprehensive assessment including neuroimaging studies of the brain. We divided patients into two groups according to neuroimaging findings: (Group 1) 10 patients harboring structural brain malformations, and (Group 2) 8 patients with normal brain images. Group 1 had a significantly earlier age at seizure onset (2 months) compared to Group 2 (21 months). The seizure semiology was more severe in Group 1, who presented multiple seizure types, need for polytherapy (80% of patients), multifocal EEG abnormalities and poorer outcome (drug resistant epilepsy in 90% of patients) than Group 2 who presented a single seizure type, generalized or focal, and non‐specific EEG pattern; these patients were successfully treated with monotherapy with good outcome. Imaging revealed a wide and complex spectrum of structural brain abnormalities including anomalies of the commissures, cerebellar malformations, cortical abnormalities, and various degrees of cortical atrophy. Epilepsy in full trisomy 18 may develop during the first months of life and can be associated with structural brain malformations. Patients with brain malformations can show multiple seizure types and can frequently be resistant to therapy with antiepileptic drugs. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The transition for patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is complicated by the multisystemic nature of this condition, age‐dependent manifestations, and high clinical variability and by the presence of intellectual disability in at least half of the individuals. In this article, we address the medical needs regarding each TSC‐related manifestation in adulthood, and the services and support required. We review existing models of transition in different chronic conditions, discuss our experience in transitioning from the pediatric to the adult TSC Clinic at our Institution, and propose general rules to follow when establishing a transition program for TSC. Although a generalizable transition model for TSC is likely not feasible for all Institutions, a multidisciplinary TSC clinic is probably the best model, developed in accordance with the resources available and country‐specific healthcare systems. Coordination of care and education of the adult team should be always sought regardless of the transition model.",

Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common type of hearing loss, affecting more than half of adults with TS. Karyotypes with a loss of the short p-arm on the X-chromosome are more prone to ear and hearing problems. The importance of detecting, investigating, and treating hearing loss with hearing aids cannot be emphasized enough. The pathophysiology of the sensorineural hearing loss in TS is not known, but theories regarding estrogen deficiency, the cell cycle delay hypothesis, IGF-1 deficiency and the possible role of the KDM6A gene are discussed. Due to the diversity of symptoms and conditions within the same karyotype, a combination of genetic factors altered by epigenetic and/or hormonal effects is probable. Further research is needed regarding the pathophysiology of ear and hearing problems in TS to develop new treatment methods.",

Some have described it as a diagnosis or syndrome, others as a term or clinical finding. This lack of common language can lead to confusion in clinical and research communities. The aim of this study was to develop a consensus-based definition for AMC using international expert opinion. A consensus-based definition will help harmonize research and clinical endeavors and will facilitate communication among families, clinicians, and researchers. This article describes the methodology used leading to a proposed definition of AMC. First, a literature review was conducted to identify AMC definitions used in included studies. The most commonly used words in the definitions were extracted. Second, a group of eight experts in AMC was selected to identify elements considered critically important to the definition of AMC. Third, based on these critical elements and the literature review, a definition was drafted by the research team. Fourth, a modified Delphi consensus process was conducted using electronic surveys with 25 experts in the field of AMC from eight countries. Survey results were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively and drafts were modified accordingly. Three rounds of surveys were completed until consensus was reached on a definition of AMC. An annotation of this definition, developed by a panel of international experts, is provided in a separate manuscript in this special issue.",

Subsequently, the causative mosaic gene alteration was discovered, the c.49G&gt;A p.E17K variant in AKT1 . As well, a number of overlapping overgrowth disorders attributable to mosaic PIK3CA variants have now been characterized, leading to the designation of PIK3CA ‐related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). Finally, ongoing work to better characterize Proteus syndrome has led to identification of additional features of that disorder that could be useful in diagnostic criteria. We have taken the opportunity of these discoveries to re‐evaluate the Proteus syndrome diagnostic criteria. Here we propose a new set of diagnostic criteria that establishes a weighted, point‐based system for the phenotypic attributes and then integrates that with the potential molecular test results to result in one of two designations: AKT1 ‐related Proteus syndrome or AKT1 ‐related overgrowth spectrum. A patient whose only manifestation is an AKT1 c.49G&gt;A‐positive tumor would receive neither of these designations. Here we review the rational basis of diagnostic criteria and argue that a unitary diagnostic entity is a distinct gene‐phenotype dyad and that this should be the model for all mendelian disorders. The gene‐alone or phenotype‐alone approach is inadequate to rigorously delineate a unitary diagnostic entity.",

    "abstract": "Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a common developmental defect caused by failure to define the midline of the forebrain and/or midface. HPE is associated with heterozygous mutations in Nodal and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway components, but clinical presentation is highly variable, and many mutation carriers are unaffected. It is therefore thought that such mutations interact with more common modifiers, genetic and/or environmental, to produce severe patterning defects. Modifiers are difficult to identify, as their effects are context‐dependent and occur within the complex genetic and environmental landscapes that characterize human populations. This has made a full understanding of HPE etiology challenging. We discuss here the use of mice, a genetically tractable model sensitive to teratogens, as a system to address this challenge. Mice carrying mutations in human HPE genes often display wide variations in phenotypic penetrance and expressivity when placed on different genetic backgrounds, demonstrating the existence of silent HPE modifier genes. Studies with mouse lines carrying SHH pathway mutations on appropriate genetic backgrounds have led to identification of both genetic and environmental modifiers that synergize with the mutations to produce a spectrum of HPE phenotypes. These models favor a scenario in which multiple modifying influences—both genetic and environmental, sensitizing and protective—interact with bona fide HPE mutations to grade phenotypic outcomes. Despite the complex interplay of HPE risk factors, mouse models have helped establish some clear concepts in HPE etiology. A combination of mouse and human cohort studies should improve our understanding of this fascinating and medically important issue.",

    "abstract": "Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a well‐described multisystem developmental disorder characterized by dysmorphic facial features, growth and behavioral deficits, and cardiac, gastrointestinal, and limb anomalies. The limb defects seen in CdLS can be mild, with small feet or hands only, or can be severe, with variable deficiency defects involving primarily the ulnar structures and ranging from mild hypoplasia of the fifth digit to complete absence of the forearm. Interestingly, the upper limbs are typically much more involved than the lower extremities that generally manifest with small feet and 2–3 syndactyly of the toes and shortened fourth metatarsal. The upper limbs often manifest asymmetric involvement. The limb findings in our cohort of 378 individuals with CdLS demonstrate a consistent pattern of laterality and symmetry involvement (with increased severity of right‐sided limb in individuals with asymmetric limb defects) and a correlation of more significant limb defects with an increased risk of other structural anomalies, and more severe behavioral outcomes. Additionally, we found that individuals with mutations in NIPBL were most likely to have limb defects compared to mutations in other genes with nonsense, exonic deletion, and frameshift mutations being most prevalent in those with limb defects. Characterization of the limb differences in children with CdLS may provide a tool to assist in genetic counseling and determining prognosis. This paper will review the limb involvement in a large cohort of individuals with CdLS assessing the correlation with molecular etiologies, symmetry, additional structural birth defects, and cognitive outcomes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "In some parts of the world, prenatal screening using analysis of circulating cell‐free (cf) DNA in the plasma of pregnant women has become part of routine prenatal care with limited professional guidelines and without significant input from the Turner syndrome community. In contrast to the very high positive predictive values (PPVs) achieved with cfDNA analysis for trisomy 21 (91% for high‐risk and 82% for low‐risk cases), the PPVs for monosomy X are much lower (~26%). This is because the maternal plasma sample contains both maternal cfDNA and placental DNA, which is a proxy for the fetal genome. Underlying biological mechanisms for false positive monosomy X screening results include confined placental mosaicism, co‐twin demise, and maternal mosaicism. Somatic loss of a single X chromosome in the mother is a natural phenomenon that occurs with aging; this could explain many of the false positive cfDNA results. There is also increased awareness of women who have constitutional mosaicism for 45, X who are fertile. It is important to recognize that a positive cfDNA screen for 45, X does not mean that the fetus has Turner syndrome. A follow‐up diagnostic test, either amniocentesis or neonatal karyotype/chromosome microarray, is recommended. Research studies on cell‐free mRNA in second trimester amniotic fluid, which is almost exclusively fetal, demonstrate consistent dysregulation of genes involved in the hematologic, immune, and neurologic systems. This suggests that some of the pathophysiology of Turner syndrome occurs early in fetal life and presents novel opportunities for consideration of antenatal treatments.",

Diabetes and cardiovascular disease are the major contributors to this burden. Precursors to diabetes and cardiovascular disease make up what is known as metabolic syndrome, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and elevated fasting glucose. These features of poor cardiometabolic health are also prevalent among women with TS. Youth with TS also exhibit many of these features, indicating that the pathogenesis of these cardiometabolic conditions may begin early in life. The etiology of the increased risk of cardiometabolic conditions in TS is likely multifactorial, involving genetics, epigenetics, hypogonadism, medical comorbidities, medications, and lifestyle. Counseling for the increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases as well as efforts to prevent or lower this risk should be routinely provided in the care of all patients with TS.

    "abstract": "Our goal is to identify the genetic underpinnings of bicuspid aortic valve and aortopathy in Turner syndrome. We performed whole exome sequencing on 188 Turner syndrome study subjects from the GenTAC registry. A gene‐based burden test, SKAT‐O, was used to evaluate the data using bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and aortic dimension z‐scores as covariates. This revealed that TIMP3 was associated with BAV and increased aortic dimensions at exome‐wide significance. It had been previously shown that genes on chromosome Xp contribute to aortopathy when hemizygous. Our analysis of Xp genes revealed that hemizygosity for TIMP1 , a functionally redundant paralogue of TIMP3 , increased the odds of having BAV aortopathy compared to individuals with more than one TIMP1 copy. The combinatorial effect of a single copy of TIMP1 and TIMP3 risk alleles synergistically increased the risk for BAV aortopathy to nearly 13‐fold. TIMP1 and TIMP3 are tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) which are involved in development of the aortic valve and protection from thoracic aneurysms. We propose that the combination of TIMP1 haploinsufficiency and deleterious variants in TIMP3 significantly increases the risk of BAV aortopathy in Turner syndrome, and suggest that TIMP1 hemizygosity may play a role in euploid male aortic disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rare diseases comprise a diverse group of conditions, most of which involve genetic causes. We describe the variable spectrum of findings and clinical impacts of exome sequencing (ES) in a cohort of 500 patients with rare diseases. In total, 164 primary findings were reported in 158 patients, representing an overall diagnostic yield of 31.6%. Most of the findings (61.6%) corresponded to autosomal dominant conditions, followed by autosomal recessive (25.6%) and X‐linked (12.8%) conditions. These patients harbored 195 variants, among which 43.6% are novel in the literature. The rate of molecular diagnosis was considerably higher for prenatal samples (67%; 4/6), younger children (44%; 24/55), consanguinity (50%; 3/6), gastrointestinal/liver disease (44%; 16/36) and syndromic/malformative conditions (41%; 72/175). For 15.6% of the cohort patients, we observed a direct potential for the redirection of care with targeted therapy, tumor screening, medication adjustment and monitoring for disease‐specific complications. Secondary findings were reported in 37 patients (7.4%). Based on cost‐effectiveness studies in the literature, we speculate that the reports of secondary findings may influence an increase of 123.2 years in the life expectancy for our cohort, or 0.246 years/cohort patient. ES is a powerful method to identify the molecular bases of monogenic disorders and redirect clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Genetic testing can provide definitive molecular diagnoses and guide clinical management decisions from preconception through adulthood. Innovative solutions for scaling clinical genomics services are necessary if they are to transition from a niche specialty to a routine part of patient care. The expertise of specialists, like genetic counselors and medical geneticists, has traditionally been relied upon to facilitate testing and follow‐up, and while ideal, this approach is limited in its ability to integrate genetics into primary care. As individuals, payors, and providers increasingly realize the value of genetics in mainstream medicine, several implementation challenges need to be overcome. These include electronic health record integration, patient and provider education, tools to stay abreast of guidelines, and simplification of the test ordering process. Currently, no single platform offers a holistic view of genetic testing that streamlines the entire process across specialties that begins with identifying at‐risk patients in mainstream care settings, providing pretest education, facilitating consent and test ordering, and following up as a “genetic companion” for ongoing management. We describe our vision for using software that includes clinical‐grade chatbots and decision support tools, with direct access to genetic counselors and pharmacists within a modular, integrated, end‐to‐end testing journey.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Increased risk of thromboembolism has been recognized in individuals with mosaic overgrowth disorders, Proteus syndrome (PS) and PIK3CA ‐related overgrowth spectrum (PROS), including Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome and CLOVES syndrome. PS and PROS have distinct, yet overlapping clinical findings and are caused by somatic pathogenic variants in the PI3K/AKT gene signaling pathway. PS is caused by a single somatic activating AKT1 c.49G &gt; A p.E17K variant while PROS can be caused one of multiple variants in PIK3CA . The role of prothrombotic factors, endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and vascular malformations in both PS and PROS have not been previously investigated. A pilot study of prospective clinical and laboratory evaluations with the purposes of identifying potential risk factors for thrombosis was conducted. Doppler ultrasounds and magnetic resonance angiogram/ venography (MRA/MRV) scans identified vascular malformations in PS and PROS that were not appreciated on physical examination. Abnormal D‐dimers (0.60–2.0 mcg/ml) occurred in half of individuals, many having vascular malformations, but no thromboses. Soluble vascular endothelial markers, including thrombomodulin, soluble vascular adhesion molecule (sVCAM), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM), E‐selectin, and P‐selectin were significantly higher in PS and PROS compared to controls. However, no single attribute was identified that explained the risk of thrombosis. Predisposition to thrombosis is likely multifactorial with risk factors including chronic stasis within vascular malformations, stasis from impaired mobility (e.g., following surgery), decreased anticoagulant proteins, and effects of AKT1 and PIK3CA variants on vascular endothelium. Based on our findings, we propose clinical recommendations for surveillance of thrombosis in PS and PROS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is a major regulator of gene expression involved in pluripotency, lineage commitment, and corticogenesis. This important complex is composed of seven different proteins, with mutations in CHD3 , CHD4 , and GATAD2B being associated with neurodevelopmental disorders presenting with macrocephaly and intellectual disability similar to other overgrowth and intellectual disability (OGID) syndromes. Pathogenic variants in CHD3 and CHD4 primarily involve disruption of enzymatic function. GATAD2B variants include loss‐of‐function mutations that alter protein dosage and missense variants that involve either of two conserved domains (CR1 and CR2) known to interact with other NuRD proteins. In addition to macrocephaly and intellectual disability, CHD3 variants are associated with inguinal hernias and apraxia of speech; whereas CHD4 variants are associated with skeletal anomalies, deafness, and cardiac defects. GATAD2B‐associated neurodevelopmental disorder (GAND) has phenotypic overlap with both of these disorders. Of note, structural models of NuRD indicate that CHD3 and CHD4 require direct contact with the GATAD2B‐CR2 domain to interact with the rest of the complex. Therefore, the phenotypic overlaps of CHD3‐ and CHD4‐related disorders with GAND are consistent with a loss in the ability of GATAD2B to recruit CHD3 or CHD4 to the complex. The shared features of these neurodevelopmental disorders may represent a new class of OGID syndrome: the NuRDopathies.",

This study assessed the professional impact of the pandemic on genetic counselors (GCs) and evaluated how genetics service delivery models changed in New York State (NYS). One hundred sixty‐five NYS GCs participated in an anonymous survey. Clinic structure, telegenetics (video and/or telephone consultations) use and acceptability, and professional practices before and during the pandemic were compared. The most frequently reported consultation type shifted from in‐person only (49%) before the pandemic to telegenetics only (39%) during. Most were satisfied with video (93.1%) and telephone (81.4%) telegenetics. Additionally, 93.5% of participants expressed a desire to continue using telegenetics after the pandemic resolves. Common obstacles included difficulties coordinating sample collection (60.2%) and obtaining written consent for testing (57.6%). Billing methods for consultations during the pandemic did not change significantly. Participants were asked about NYS's lack of licensure, which restricts billing options. Most felt that genetic counseling licensure would benefit the profession (92.6%), the public (88.5%), and their institution/company (74.5%). This study provides insight into the effects of the rapid adoption of telegenetics and can guide future discussions about best practices for its use even after the health crisis resolves.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Klinefelter syndrome (KS), which normally presents with a 47,XXY karyotype, is the most common sex chromosome disorder in males. It is also the most common genetic cause of male infertility. KS subjects are typically tall, with small and firm testes, gynecomastia, broad hips, and sparse body hair, although a less evident presentation is also possible. KS is also characterized by a high prevalence of hypogonadism, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this article is to systematically review metabolic and the cardiovascular risk factors in KS patients. Hypogonadism has an important role in the pathogenesis of the changes in body composition (particularly visceral obesity) and hence of insulin resistance and MetS, but the association between KS and MetS may go beyond hypogonadism alone. From childhood, KS patients may show an increase in visceral fat with a reduction in lean body mass and an increase in glucose and impaired fat metabolism. Their increased incidence of congenital anomalies, epicardial adipose tissue, and thromboembolic disease suggests they have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. There is conflicting evidence on the effects of testosterone therapy on body composition and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "In both community care and across a broad range of hospital specialties, many healthcare professionals (nurses, midwives, physical and other therapists, psychologists, and doctors) will likely attend to people with Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) or hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD). The belief that EDS is rare or ultra-rare is true for several forms of the syndrome, but increasingly the hypermobile type of EDS (hEDS) is thought more common, and HSD (a population previously described within joint hypermobility syndrome prior to the 2017 nosology changes; Castori et al., 2017; Tinkle et al., 2017) much more common. Together the prevalence of hEDS and HSD is likely greater than 1 in 500 in the general population (Demmler et al., 2019), and a common presentation in general musculoskeletal clinics (Grahame & Hakim, 2006). Yet often the journey to diagnosis and treatment is challenging for patients, who may receive no diagnosis, or misdiagnoses. In addition, misconceptions that the issues are solely mental health concerns are commonly reported. Too often there is more than a decade delay in diagnosis, and the negative impact on quality of life from living with under-managed disease is significant (Bell & Pearce, 2021; Berglund, Pettersson, Pigg, & Kristiansson, 2015; Castori, Camerota, Celletti, Grammatico, & Padua, 2010; Demmler et al., 2019; Mu et al., 2019). Multiple morbidities can arise from structural pathologies throughout the body in EDS. These pathologies include musculoskeletal, dermatological, neurological, ocular, oro-dental, laryngeal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, vascular, and uro-gynecological disorders. Symptoms of chronic widespread pain and chronic fatigue are almost universal (Hakim et al., 2020; Schubart, Schaefer, Hakim, Francomano, & Bascom, 2019). The phenotype, in part, depends on the type of EDS, but features can overlap between them, most clearly seen in the musculoskeletal system and skin, for example. These pathologies have been well documented and are increasingly understood through the determination of their molecular genetics and the ensuing abnormalities of collagens and other molecules of the extracellular matrix (Malfait et al., 2017). In HSD, the principal structural morbidity is in the musculoskeletal system, sharing similar concerns to EDS in presenting with joint instability, ease of joint injury, musculoskeletal, and neuropathic pain, and chronic fatigue (Castori et al., 2017). In addition, several co-morbidities are associated with EDS and HSD. These include disorders of autonomic function, gastrointestinal function, neurodevelopment, mental health, and inflammation and systemic manifestations of mast cell activation. In 2017, alongside the new criteria for EDS and the framework for diagnosing HSD, the International Consortium on the EDS and HSD published a series of review articles exploring what was known of the associations and management of many of these co-morbidities in these conditions (Tinkle, Malfait, Francomano, & Byers, 2017). These and more areas of health concern continue to be explored. Recent large population and registry data affirm their high prevalence in EDS and HSD (Boris & Bernadzikowski, 2021; Cederlöf et al., 2016; Demmler et al., 2019; Hakim et al., 2020; Ritelli, Venturini, Cinquina, Chiarelli, & Colombi, 2020; Schubart et al., 2019), and reports also describe similar severity of co-morbidities in hEDS and HSD (Aubry-Rozier et al., 2021; Copetti et al., 2019; Hakim, 2019). With substantial growth in knowledge in the field, keeping up to date with advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of this heterogeneous group of conditions is challenging. No individual healthcare professional can truly manage all aspects of these conditions at an expert level. Care typically requires a holistic and multidisciplinary approach. Yet such care, ideally embedded in the community, supported by subspecialty medical, therapies, and social care (Whitty et al., 2020) is substantially lacking for EDS and HSD internationally. Currently, there are small numbers of expert clinics, centers, and networks striving to support patients and colleagues. Access to care is profoundly limited, yet management of many of the common concerns is well within the ability of most generalists with specialist support when needed. Recognizing the exponential growth in knowledge, the multifaceted challenges faced by healthcare systems internationally, and the need for greater numbers of healthcare professionals to feel informed and confident in the diagnosis and management of EDS and HSD, the Ehlers-Danlos Society in 2019 established EDS ECHO, an affiliate of Project ECHO® (Project ECHO, 2021; The Ehlers-Danlos Society, 2021). Project ECHO's philosophies include \"all teach, all learn\" and \"move knowledge, not people.\" The ECHO model primarily seeks to increase access to care. Embracing this, EDS ECHO has established several programs for healthcare professionals and for community leaders and advocates in EDS and HSD across the world. Participation is free, and all can access a large repository of teaching material, continuing education credits, and support from a truly multidisciplinary and international network of peers. We have shown participants gain both knowledge and confidence in managing EDS and HSD (Hakim, Schubart, Francomano, Bascom, & Bloom, 2021). In October 2020, EDS ECHO (led by author A.J.H) brought together experts from across the breadth of the co-morbidities seen in EDS and HSD. Plenary sessions included expert reviews of the latest literature, case reports, and selected original research abstracts. This special issue of the American Journal of Medical Genetics, Part C, is an extension of that conference. It explores: the patient journey; the value of coalitions; the tools used by physical therapists in their assessment and management; current evidence for surgical outcomes in orthopedics; pain mechanisms; pathophysiology of mast cell activation, and the potential role of inflammatory mediators in EDS and HSD; mental health concerns; associations between EDS, HSD and neurodevelopmental disorders; autonomic dysfunction, and its relationship with mental and physical health; dental disease; upper and lower airway disease; functional bowel disorders, and vascular compression syndromes as a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms; urological concerns; and gynecological concerns, and considerations in pregnancy. It seeks to compliment or update most of the aforementioned reviews from 2017, introduces reviews in subjects that were not covered at that time, and shares new insights through the inclusion of several original research articles. In an ongoing commitment to sharing knowledge and supporting clinicians and patients, we hope colleagues find this issue insightful and valuable in supporting them in the assessment and care of their patients. The authors wish to thank all those who have contributed to this special issue, and the many more colleagues and EDS and HSD community advocates working tirelessly to expand and disseminate knowledge in this field of Medicine. The authors express immense gratitude to the staff responsible for managing EDS ECHO at The Ehlers-Danlos Society, and in particular Stacey Simmonds without whom the EDS ECHO conference upon which this issue is based would not have happened. Our gratitude also goes to Anne Slavotinek, Editor-in-Chief, Subhasri Thiagarajan, and the editorial team at the American Journal of Medical Genetics for their oversight of the production of this issue. The authors declare no potential conflict of interest. Alan J. Hakim and Clair A. Francomano conceived of and contributed to the issue; and, with Brad T. Tinkle peer-reviewed and edited the works in this issue. All three wrote this editorial. Does not apply since no data was created.",

People with EDS are often classified as \"somatizers\" by untrained clinicians. However, research on the biological basis of EDS is improving our understanding of the physiology and psychopathology of the disorder. In this article, we consider the literature on the psychopathological dimensions associated with EDS as well as the EDS symptoms in psychiatric conditions since our review in 2017. Literature confirms that psychological processes (i.e., fear, emotional distress, or negative emotions) in EDS have a significant impact on the outcomes of EDS. Common systemic associations are found between anxiety disorders and EDS as well as significant correlations with neurodevelopmental, eating, mood, and sleep disorders. There is limited but increasing evidence of an association between EDS and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which should be further explored. The broad spectrum of human anxiety and associated somatic symptoms (beyond anxiety disorders) appears to be the core of the psychopathology in EDS and therefore, detecting and assessing EDS might be a new opportunity for psychiatric nosology to develop more inclusive phenotypes like the Neuroconnective Phenotype that include both somatic and psychological manifestations.",

Caregivers appreciated the convenience of virtual visits but sometimes missed the personal connection of an in‐person visit. Overall, though, virtual visits were frequently viewed as no different than office visits. Team members identified benefits and challenges of virtual visits, as well as lessons learned from this transition.

The exact pathogenesis has yet to be fully elucidated but is likely varied based on the type of injury and the primary target of that injury. However, the approach to treatment is often based on the degree of podocyte foot process effacement and clinical presentation without sufficient attention paid to etiology. In this regard, there are many monogenic causes of FSGS with variable presentation from nephrotic syndrome with histological features of primary podocytopathy to more modest degrees of proteinuria with limited evidence of podocyte foot process injury. It is likely that genetic causes are largely underdiagnosed, as the role and the timing of genetic testing in FSGS is not established and genetic counseling, testing options, and interpretation of genotype in the context of phenotype may be outside the scope of practice for both nephrologists and geneticists. Yet most clinicians believe that a genetic diagnosis can lead to targeted therapy, limit the use of high‐dose corticosteroids as a therapeutic trial, and allow the prediction of the natural history and risk for recurrence in the transplanted kidney. In this manuscript, we emphasize that genetic FSGS is not monolithic in its presentation, opine on the importance of genetic testing and provide an algorithmic approach to deployment of genetic testing in a timely fashion when faced with a patient with FSGS.",

Genetically, these syndromes are defined by germline pathogenic variants in RAS/MAPK pathway genes resulting in activation of this pathway. Clinically, their common molecular signature leads to comparable phenotypes, including cardiac anomalies, neurologic disorders and notably, elevated cancer risk. Cancer risk in individuals with RASopathies has been estimated from retrospective reviews and cohort studies. For example, in Costello syndrome, cancer incidence is significantly elevated over the general population, largely due to solid tumors. In some forms of Noonan syndrome, cancer risk is also elevated over the general population and is enriched for hematologic malignancies. Thus, cancer surveillance guidelines have been developed to monitor for the occurrence of such cancers in individuals with some RASopathies. These include abdominal ultrasound and urinalyses for individuals with Costello syndrome, while complete blood counts and splenic examination are recommended in Noonan syndrome. Improved cancer risk estimates and refinement of surveillance recommendations will improve the care of individuals with RASopathies.",

Despite significant genetic heterogeneity, BBS1 and BBS10 are responsible for major diagnosis in western countries. It is well established that eight BBS proteins, namely BBS1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 18, form the BBSome, a multiprotein complex serving as a regulator of ciliary membrane protein composition. Less information is available for BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12, three proteins showing sequence homology with the CCT/TRiC family of group II chaperonins. Even though their chaperonin function is debated, scientific evidence demonstrated that they are required for initial BBSome assembly in vitro. Recent studies suggest that genotype may partially predict clinical outcomes. Indeed, patients carrying truncating mutations in any gene show the most severe phenotype; moreover, mutations in chaperonin‐like BBS proteins correlated with severe kidney impairment. This study is a critical review of the literature on genetics, expression level, cellular localization and function of BBS proteins, focusing primarily on the chaperonin‐like BBS proteins, and aiming to provide some clues to understand the pathomechanisms of disease in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The cardiovascular phenotype associated with RASopathies has expanded far beyond the original descriptions of pulmonary valve stenosis by Dr Jaqueline Noonan in 1968 and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by Hirsch et al. in 1975. Because of the common underlying RAS/MAPK pathway dysregulation, RASopathy syndromes usually present with a typical spectrum of overlapping cardiovascular anomalies, although less common cardiac defects can occur. The identification of the causative genetic variants has enabled the recognition of specific correlations between genotype and cardiac phenotype. Characterization and understanding of genotype–phenotype associations is not only important for counseling a family of an infant with a new diagnosis of a RASopathy condition but is also critical for their clinical prognosis with respect to cardiac disease, neurodevelopment and other organ system involvement over the lifetime of the patient. This review will focus on the cardiac manifestations of the most common RASopathy syndromes, the relationship between cardiac defects and causal genetic variation, the contribution of cardiovascular abnormalities to morbidity and mortality and the most relevant follow‐up issues for patients affected by RAS/MAPK pathway diseases, with respect to cardiac clinical outcomes and management, in children and in the adult population.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Genomic and gene‐targeted therapies hold great promise in addressing the global issue of rare diseases. To achieve this promise, however, it is critical the twin goals of equity in access to testing and diagnosis, and equity in access to therapy be considered early in the life cycle of development and implementation. Rare disease researchers and clinicians must simultaneously recognize the life‐altering potential of early diagnosis and administration of gene‐targeted therapeutics while acknowledging that not everyone who experiences a rare disease and needs these therapies will be able to afford or access them. Achieving equity in the development of and access to gene‐targeted therapies will not only require innovations in research, clinical, regulatory, and reimbursement frameworks, but will also necessitate increased attention to the ethical, legal, and social implications when establishing research paradigms and the translation of research results into novel interventions for rare genetic diseases. This article highlights and discusses the growing importance and recognition of health equity across the spectrum of rare disease research and care delivery.",

We described prevalence of mosaic Down syndrome and the co‐occurrence of common chronic conditions in 94,533 Medicaid enrolled adults with any Down syndrome enrolled from 2016 to 2019. Methods We identified mosaic Down syndrome using the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth edition code for mosaic Down syndrome and compared to those with nonmosaic Down syndrome codes. We identified chronic conditions using established algorithms and compared prevalence by mosaicism. Results In total, 1966 (2.08%) had claims for mosaic Down syndrome. Mosaicism did not differ by sex or race/ethnicity with similar age distributions. Individuals with mosaicism were more likely to present with autism (13.9% vs. 9.6%) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (17.7% vs. 14.0%) compared to individuals without mosaicism. In total, 22.3% of those with mosaic Down syndrome and 21.5% of those without mosaicism had claims for Alzheimer's dementia (Prevalence difference: 0.8; 95% Confidence interval: −1.0, 2.8). The mosaic group had 1.19 times the hazard of Alzheimer's dementia compared to the nonmosaic group (95% CI: 1.0, 1.3). Discussion Mosaicism may be associated with a higher susceptibility to certain neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's dementia. Our findings challenge previous assumptions about its protective effects in Down syndrome. Further research is necessary to explore these associations in greater depth.",

The incidence of TC has increased worldwide in the last few decades, both in medullary and follicular‐derived subtypes. Several drugs, including multikinase and selective inhibitors, have been explored. Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are selective RET inhibitors that have shown clear clinical benefits for patients in the LIBRETTO and ARROW trials, respectively. Currently, their development and application in clinical practice are ongoing. However, its efficacy in different RET pathogenic variants has not yet been well established. Although selpercatinib and pralsetinib achieved a high ORR, no data are available regarding the differences in tumor responses of both TC groups according to RET pathogenic variants. Clinical trials and literature have analyzed the efficacy of selective RET inhibitors with a special interest in the most common variants. A review of LIBRETTO and ARROW trials was made regarding the change in tumor size depending on the pathogenic variants. M918T pathogenic variant resulted in a higher complete response rate. Patients who underwent fusion had the highest ORR (objective response rate). MKi‐treated patients did not exhibit significant differences from untreated patients. Different RET pathogenic variants are not biomarkers of RETi response in TC. Selpercatinib showed a tendency to achieve a complete response. All patients with RET pathogenic variants should receive treatment with selpercatinib or pralsetinib at any moment of the therapeutic schedule owing to off‐target inhibition and toxicity. Therefore, new targets for drug sensitivity and resistance should be explored.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Determining karyotype‐phenotype correlations for individuals with Turner syndrome (“TS individuals”) is a longstanding research endeavor. The limited literature on Turner syndrome (TS) with a ring X chromosome hinders counseling about the neuropsychological and clinical features. To further characterize these phenotypes, we compared 27 TS individuals with 46,X,r(X)/45,X (“ring X”) to 50 non‐mosaic 45,X, and 27 mosaic 45,X/46,XX (“mosaic 45,X”) individuals. This retrospective cohort study of 104 individuals reported on cardiac and renal malformations, endocrine and neuropsychological conditions, and applied contemporary terminology in a nuanced framework to assess intellectual developmental disorder (IDD). We noted an increased IDD risk for TS individuals with ring X compared to mosaic 45,X and non‐mosaic 45,X, though at a lower frequency (26%, 6 of 23) than previously reported. Across karyotypes, 49% (16 of 33) of TS individuals with neuropsychological evaluations had a diagnosis of other specified neurodevelopmental disorder due to TS. In TS individuals with ring X, there was an increased risk for hypothyroidism, whereas bicuspid aortic valve and horseshoe kidney were less frequent compared to other karyotypes. These results add to the limited literature on TS individuals with ring X and can inform the counseling of TS individuals, caregivers, and expectant parents.",

While transition guidelines have been published by multiple national and international organizations, transition processes have not been optimized for many populations, including youth with Turner syndrome (TS). Numerous barriers exist, at both the system and individual/family level.

The goals of this manuscript are to outline key research gaps that need to be addressed regarding health care transition in TS and to suggest strategies to optimize transition outcomes. Given the importance of a multi‐disciplinary and patient‐centered approach, we specifically outline the roles of pediatric health care teams (including navigators), adult health care teams, patients, caregivers, and institutional resources.",

The natural history of growth in Turner syndrome, the safety and efficacy of recombinant human growth hormone therapy, and the alternate growth promoting agents under consideration are presented. Timely, adequate growth hormone therapy can counter growth failure in childhood, promote catch‐up growth and help many individuals with Turner syndrome attain a near‐normal adult height. However, individual responses to growth hormone treatment are highly variable and are influenced by factors such as parental heights, age, baseline height, timing of estrogen initiation and pubertal status. Shared decision making on initiation of treatment, a candid conversation regarding the modest gradual height gain resulting from growth hormone therapy, and individualization of therapeutic goals can facilitate realistic expectations of growth promoting therapy in Turner syndrome.",

The dual sensory impairment associated with this autosomal recessive disorder makes Usher syndrome an important target for gene therapy, with dozens of published preclinical studies targeting multiple Usher syndrome genes and using multiple gene therapy strategies. Nine genes have been conclusively linked to Usher syndrome; however, data on the prevalence and contribution of specific genetic variants is lacking. Such information is essential to choosing a favorable target gene or therapeutic approach during clinical trial design. Here, we used large genomic databases to systematically evaluate the genomics of Usher syndrome. We ascertained pathogenic Usher syndrome variants from three clinical databases and determined the occurrence of these pathogenic Usher syndrome variants within: (1) a publicly available dataset including worldwide populations (GnomAD), (2) a cohort of 3888 children without hearing loss, and (3) 637 children with hearing loss. Results show significant variability in the frequency of Usher syndrome variants by gene and genetic ancestry. 1% of control subjects carry a pathogenic USH variant. Pathogenic variants in USH2A are the most prevalent, at 1 in 150 individuals (0.0062). Calculated general population prevalence for all Usher syndrome subtypes is 1 in ~29,000, indicating that 30,405 individuals in the United States and 721,769 individuals worldwide are affected. We estimate that 324 babies in the United States and 12,090 worldwide are born with Usher syndrome each year. We identify key targets for genetic therapy based on population‐level prevalence including a focus on alternatives to gene replacement therapies, specifically for USH2A .",

Surveys in English, Spanish, and Chinese included questions regarding the value of testing, pregnancy, and motherhood; the acceptability of Down syndrome in the subject's community; and the role of social and cultural influences in prenatal testing decisions. We analyzed racial/ethnic differences in all attitudinal and external influence variables, controlling for age, relationship status, and socioeconomic status. We found statistically significant racial/ethnic group differences in familiarity with an individual with Down syndrome and in 10 of 12 attitude, belief, and external influence variables, even after controlling for other sociodemographic characteristics. We also observed substantial variation within racial/ethnic groups for each of these measures. Despite the statistically significant group differences observed, R 2 values for all multivariate models were modest and response distributions overlapped substantially. Social and familial contexts for prenatal testing decisions differ among racial/ethnic groups even after accounting for age, marital status, and other socioeconomic factors. However, substantial variation within groups and overlap between groups suggest that racial/ethnic differences play a small role in the social and familial context of prenatal genetic testing decisions. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The goals of the project included: 1) using the genealogy to expedite the mapping of genes mutated in three rare recessive disorders under study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH); 2) building a freely available software package, PedHunter, to answer genetically relevant queries on our database and other similar databases; and 3) providing genealogy assistance to researchers outside NIH. All of these scientific goals had to be accomplished while maintaining the confidentiality of the persons in the database and the confidentiality of preliminary research results. We expanded the project to include complementary data sources that contained many individuals who were Anabaptist, but not Amish, and many individuals who never lived in Lancaster County. For this reason, the project was renamed Anabaptist Genealogy Database (AGDB). All of the initial goals of the project have been accomplished, and we recently marked the 5‐year anniversary of answering the first of over 100 queries by researchers outside NIH. Thus, it is an opportune time to review the construction of AGDB, summarize its usage to date, and speculate on future projects it might stimulate and facilitate. Published 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

On the assumption that anticipation in BPD may be real, several surveys of the genome of BPD probands for large trinucleotide repeats have been conducted, as have studies of many repeat‐containing candidate genes.

Of 2,592 (OMIM) entries reviewed, 188 Mendelian disorders were selected. Most (67.7%) are autosomal dominant disorders. Almost half (45.8%) feature combinations of the chronic diseases under study. At least one gene is known for 68.8% of the selected disorders, and clinical genetic testing is available for 55% of disorders. Guidelines for management and prevention are available for 33.9% of these, ranging from recommendations for supportive care to guidelines for managing affected persons and screening relatives. Significant clinical heterogeneity exists for Mendelian disorders that might present as strong family histories of common chronic diseases. Recognition of the different combinations of diseases within a pedigree, including mode of inheritance and heritable disease risk factors, facilitates diagnosis of these Mendelian disorders. Genetic testing is available for most disorders, which can further clarify the genetic risk, and for some, recommendations for management and prevention are available. However, evidence‐based guidelines are needed. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The hereditary predisposition to cancer dates historically to interest piqued by physicians as well as family members wherein striking phenotypic features were shown to cluster in families, inclusive of the rather grotesque cutaneous findings in von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis, which date back to the sixteenth century. The search for the role of primary genetic factors was heralded by studies at the infrahuman level, particularly on laboratory mouse strains with strong susceptibility to carcinogen‐induced cancer, and conversely, with resistance to the same carcinogens. These studies, developed in the 19th and 20th centuries, continue today. This article traces the historical aspects of hereditary cancer dealing with identification and ultimate molecular genetic confirmation of commonly occurring cancers, particularly of the colon in the case of familial adenomatous polyposis and its attenuated form, both due to the APC germline mutation; the Lynch syndrome due to mutations in mismatch repair genes, the most common of which were found to be MSH2 , MLH1 , and MSH6 germline mutations; the hereditary breast‐ovarian cancer syndrome with BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations; the Li‐Fraumeni (SBLA) syndrome due to the p53 mutation; and the familial atypical multiple mole melanoma in association with pancreatic cancer due to the CDKN2A ( p16 ) germline mutation. These and other hereditary cancer syndromes have been discussed in some detail relevant to their characterization, which, for many conditions, took place in the late 18th century and, in the more modern molecular genetic era, during the past two decades. Emphasis has been placed upon the manner in which improved cancer control will emanate from these discoveries. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

An increasing number of hereditary skin disorders appear to be caused by mutations in one of the genes coding for the constituent proteins of gap junctions, known as connexins. In this review, the currently known connexin disorders that feature skin abnormalities are described: keratitis–ichthyosis deafness syndrome, erythrokeratoderma variabilis, Vohwinkel's syndrome, and a novel disorder called hypotrichosis–deafness syndrome.

    "abstract": "Abstract Human neural tube defects (NTD) are a heterogeneous group that exhibit complex inheritance, making it difficult to identify the underlying cause. Due to the uniform genetic background, inbred mouse strains are a more amenable target for genetic studies. We investigated the loop‐tail ( Lp ) mouse as a model for the severe NTD, craniorachischisis. A homozygous point mutation was identified in the transmembrane protein Vangl2 , which in Drosophila has been shown to function in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. Morphological analysis of the Lp mice shows that the defect results from an abnormally broad floor plate, most likely through a failure in convergent extension. The elevated neural folds remain too far apart to contact, inhibiting neural tube closure. Recently, two other mouse mutants ( crash and circletail ) were described with a similar phenotype to Lp and were investigated as potentially new alleles. Mapping studies, however, showed that both mutants segregated to distinct loci. In the crash ( Crsh ) mouse, a mutation was identified in Celsr1 , a seven pass transmembrane receptor that encodes a protein orthologous to Drosophila Flamingo . Like Vangl2 , this gene also functions in the PCP pathway. While in circletail , a point mutation was identified introducing a premature stop codon into the apical‐basal cell polarity gene scribble ( Scrb1 ). We subsequently demonstrated a genetic interaction between all three genes, where double heterozygotes exhibit the same homozygous NTD phenotype. This strongly suggests both a candidate gene pathway and that interaction between independent recessive alleles may be a possible explanation for the complex inheritance in severe human NTD. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

This article examines how DTC marketing strategies may affect genetic counselors, using available cardiovascular disease susceptibility tests as an illustration. The interpretation of these tests is complex and includes consideration of clinical validity and utility, and the further complications of gene-environment interactions and pleiotropy. Although it is unclear to what extent genetic counselors will encounter clients who have been exposed to DTC marketing strategies, these strategies may influence genetic counseling interactions if they produce directed interest in specific tests and unrealistic expectations for the tests' capacity to predict disease. Often, a client's concern about risk for cardiovascular diseases is best addressed by established clinical tests and a family history assessment. Ethical dilemmas may arise for genetic counselors who consider whether to accept clients who request test interpretation or to order DTC-advertised tests that require a clinician's authorization. Genetic counselors' obligations to care for clients extend to interpreting DTC tests, although this obligation may be fulfilled by referral or consultation with specialists. Genetic counselors do not have an obligation to order DTC-advertised tests that have minimal clinical validity and utility at a client's request. This can be a justified restriction on autonomy based on consideration of risks to the client, the costs, and the implications for society.",

The NSD1 gene was recently found to be responsible for Sotos syndrome, and more than 150 patients with NSD1 alterations have been identified. A significant ethnic difference is found in the prevalence of different types of mutation, with a high percentage of microdeletions identified in Japanese Sotos syndrome patients and with intragenic mutations in most non‐Japense patients. NSD1 aberrations are rather specific for Sotos syndrome, but have also been detected in patients lacking one or more major criteria of the disorder, namely overgrowth, macrocephaly, and advanced bone age. Thus, new diagnostic criteria should be considered. Studies have reported different frequencies of mutations versus non‐mutations in Sotos syndrome, thus indicating allelic or locus hetereogeneity.

The focus of this review is the phenotype associated with isolated terminal deletions of 6p25, and specifically isolated submiscroscopic subtelomere deletions. A distinct phenotype has emerged consisting of developmental delay/mental retardation, language impairment, hearing loss, and ophthalmologic, cardiac, and craniofacial abnormalities. These features demonstrate considerable clinical overlap with the Ritscher-Schinzel (or cranio-cerebello-cardiac (3C)) syndrome (OMIM #220210). Isolated submiscroscopic 6p25 subtelomere terminal deletion has been reported in 11 individuals, two of whom are siblings. Cytogentic and molecular mapping of the 6p25 deletion boundary has been reported in 8 of these 10 unrelated individuals with isolated submiscroscopic subtelomere deletion. This analysis has revealed substantial phenotypic overlap between individuals with submicroscopic terminal 6p deletions and those with large, cytogenetically visible deletions of the region suggesting that the critical genes contributing to the main clinical and developmental features lie in the terminal region of 6p25.",

European clinical institutes where genetic counseling is offered to patients were contacted. One hundred seventy-seven of the 287 eligible respondents (63%) answered a questionnaire. There was strongest support for testing young children when it provides a clear medical benefit, such as in the case of FAP and MEN2A. However, there is disagreement about when to provide predictive genetic testing for childhood-onset disorders for which therapeutic or preventive measures exist with some supporting the rule of earliest onset and others giving parents wider discretion. However, for childhood-onset disorders that do not have therapeutic measures, the majority of the respondents is unwilling to provide a presymptomatic or predictive genetic test. With respect to adolescents, many held a cautious position regarding presymptomatic and predictive genetic testing. Most clinical geneticists were unwilling to provide a presymptomatic or predictive genetic test for adult-onset diseases, except if it might provide a medical benefit. Although adolescents might be legally in the position to request a presymptomatic or predictive genetic test personally, the clinical geneticists are significantly more willing to provide a test if this request is made together with the minor's parents. This variability demonstrates the need for clinical geneticists to discuss their contradicting views and to develop harmonized practices throughout Europe.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hematologic abnormalities are common in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). Increased erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is frequently found among DS infants and remains elevated throughout life in two‐thirds of patients, making interpretation of red cell indices for diagnosis of nutritional anemias or bone marrow failure disorders more challenging. Transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) associated with pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and circulating immature WBCs, is found almost exclusively in DS infants with an incidence of approximately 10%. In most cases, TMD regresses spontaneously within the first 3 months of life, but in some children, it can be life threatening or even fatal. Despite the high rate of spontaneous regression, TMD can be a preleukemic disorder in 20–30% of children with DS. The types of malignancy, response to therapy, and clinical outcome in children with DS are also unique. There is an increased risk of leukemia with an equal incidence of lymphoid and myeloid leukemia. Acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) subtype is the most common form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in this setting, and is uncommon in children without DS. Somatic mutations of the gene encoding the hematopoetic growth factor GATA1 have been shown to be specific for TMD and AMKL in children with DS. Myelodysplastic syndrome can precede AML. Children with DS and leukemia are more sensitive to some chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate than other children which requires careful monitoring for toxicity. Although the risk for leukemia is higher in individuals with DS, these patients have a lower risk of developing solid tumors, with the exception of germ cell tumors, and perhaps retinoblastoma and lymphoma. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It has been 15 years since we proposed that assays of telomere integrity might reveal cryptic translocations and deletions as a significant cause of mental retardation (MR) in patients with normal G‐banded karyotypes. Development of unique genomic probes adjacent to the subtelomeric repeats of each chromosome arm allowed multiplex FISH analyses that confirmed such cryptic telomeric imbalances in 3–6% of all unexplained MR. Although such “telomere FISH” analysis quickly became standard of care, limitations of this technology platform included a lack of information on the size and gene content of the deleted/duplicated segments and the failure to detect interstitial deletions not involving the most distal unique clone. The development of “molecular ruler” clone sets for every human telomere provided the foundation for accurate determination of size and gene content of each imbalance, as well as the detection of interstitial deletions within these regions. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has emerged as a powerful technology to assess single copy changes (monosomy or trisomy) at targeted loci such as telomeres or across the whole genome. This technology now replaces multiplex FISH for the assessment of telomere integrity in unexplained MR and has the advantage of efficiently determining the size and gene content of the imbalance, as well as detecting interstitial deletions near telomeres or anywhere else in the genome covered by the array design. The application of aCGH in several studies of unexplained MR has confirmed that telomere imbalances are overrepresented compared to “average” chromosomal regions, although this is likely due to random chromosome breakage rather than specific molecular mechanisms associated with the genomic architecture of human telomeres. Telomere imbalances are significantly larger than initially envisioned (∼40% are &gt;5 Mb in size), and indicate the analytic sensitivity of the G‐banded karyotype is much lower than previously thought. Finally, experience with smaller benign variants compared to larger pathogenic imbalances at telomeres serves as a model for approaching whole‐genome aCGH in a clinical setting. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Children with CDH are born with the abdominal contents herniated through the diaphragm and exhibit an associated pulmonary hypoplasia which is frequently accompanied by severe morbidity and mortality. Although the etiology of CDH is largely unknown, considerable progress has been made in understanding its molecular mechanisms through the usage of genetic, teratogenic, and surgical models. The following review focuses on the teratogenic and surgical models of CDH and the possible molecular mechanisms of nitrofen (a diphenyl ether, formerly used as an herbicide) in both induction of CDH and pulmonary hypoplasia. In addition, the mechanisms of other compounds including several anti‐inflammatory agents that have been linked to CDH will be discussed. Furthermore, this review will also explore the importance of vitamin A in lung and diaphragm development and the possible mechanisms of teratogen interference in vitamin A homeostasis. Continued exploration of these models will bring forth a clearer understanding of CDH and its molecular underpinnings, which will ultimately facilitate development of therapeutic strategies. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Following birth, we suspected SLOS in this fetus due to the additional findings of ambiguous genitalia and bilateral 2–3 toe syndactyly. The diagnosis of SLOS was confirmed by finding an elevated amniotic fluid 7‐dehydrocholesterol level (9,890 ng/ml; normal range = 3–9 ng/ml), and molecularly by detecting two different mutations in the DHCR7 gene, the gene causing SLOS. The first mutation was an IVS8‐1G&gt;T change and the second was a deletion of exons 3 and 4; this latter mutation has not been reported previously. The mother carries the deletion, while the father carries the splice‐site mutation. Also of note, the father has an abnormally low total plasma cholesterol level (104–109 mg/dl). This is the most severe case of HPE described in any patient with SLOS. We postulate that the HPE in this case resulted from severe impairment of Sonic Hedgehog signaling secondary to abnormal cholesterol metabolism; however, the unique combination of mutations in the fetus functionally appears to be no different from other homozygous null mutations reported in DHCR7 . Therefore, there must be other yet to be identified factors that contributed to the severity of HPE in SLOS. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Prior studies with relatively small sample sizes suggest that hearing loss in WS has an early onset and may be progressive, yet the auditory phenotype and the scope of the hearing loss have not been adequately characterized. We used standard audiometric tools: Otoscopy, tympanometry, air‐conduction (bone conduction when available) behavioral testing, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to measure hearing sensitivity and outer hair cell function. We tested 81 individuals with WS aged 5.33–59.50 years. Sixty‐three percent of the school‐age and 92% of the adult participants had mild to moderately‐severe hearing loss. The hearing loss in at least 50% was sensorineural. DPOAE testing corroborated behavioral results. Strikingly, 12 of 14 participants with hearing within normal limits bilaterally had 4,000‐Hz DPOAE input/output (DPOAE IO) functions indicative of outer hair cell damage and impaired cochlear compression. Our results indicate that hearing loss is very common in WS. Furthermore, individuals with WS who have “normal” hearing as defined by behavioral thresholds may actually have sub‐clinical impairments or undetected cochlear pathology. Our findings suggest outer hair cell dysfunction in otherwise normal hearing individuals. The DPOAE IO in this same group revealed growth functions typically seen in groups with noise‐induced damage. Given this pattern of findings, individuals with WS may be at increased risk of noise‐induced hearing loss. Recommendations regarding audiological testing for individuals with WS and accommodations for these individuals in both academic and nonacademic settings are provided. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this study is to describe the interplay of adolescent girls' and young womens' self‐concept, coping behaviors, and adjustment associated with knowledge of genetic risk for fragile X syndrome. We will report here findings on self‐concept. Using a multi‐group cross‐sectional design this study focused on girls ages 14–25 years from families previously diagnosed with fragile X syndrome, who knew they were (1) carriers (n = 20; mean age 18.35 years s.d. 2.5), or (2) noncarriers (n = 18; mean age 17.78 years s.d. 2.69), or (3) at‐risk to be carriers (n = 15; mean age 17.87 s.d. 3.18). The girls completed the Tennessee Self‐Concept Scale (TSCS:2), a visual analog scale, and a guided interview. Total and all subscale scores on the TSCS:2 were in the normal range for all three groups. However, threats to self‐concept were found in personal self (physical self, genetic identity, and parental role), social self, and family self (family genetic identity) as they specifically related to the meaning of genetic information and varied based on risk status. Our findings suggest that risk information itself is threatening and for some girls, may be as threatening as learning one is a carrier. Certainty related to genetic risk status appears to make a positive difference for some girls by allowing them the opportunity to face the challenge of their genetic risk status and to begin to consider the meaning of this information. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

A working group of professionals assembled a 14-question pilot questionnaire that was subsequently tested in 13 clinical sites. Nearly 400 responses were used to validate the tool and ultimately construct a 7-item questionnaire. The 7-item questionnaire was found to be reliable and valid and addresses two key components of patient satisfaction: technical aspects of care and interpersonal relations. The tool is compared to other patient satisfaction tools developed for use in the clinical genetics setting. A Spanish version is also provided.",

This condition results in a constellation of structural cerebral and craniofacial abnormalities. Here we present two new patients and review 30 patients from the literature with HPE and variants of agnathia. The majority of these patients are female and have the most severe forms of HPE, with cyclopia present more frequently than is usually observed in cohorts of patients with HPE. Also, many patients have additional clinical findings not typical in patients with classic HPE, particularly situs abnormalities. Recent animal studies suggest that the association of HPE and agnathia may relate to alterations in signaling from forebrain and foregut endoderm organizing centers and subsequent first pharyngeal arch development, although present models are inadequate to explain all of the clinical findings of this enigmatic human syndrome. Further research is required to better elucidate the causal and pathogenic basis of this association. Published 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Among a variety of embryological toxins that can induce HPE, inhibitors, and other pertubations of cholesterol biosynthesis have been shown to be important factors, most likely because cholesterol is required in the Sonic hedgehog signaling cascade. Decreased levels of maternal cholesterol during pregnancy increase the risk for preterm delivery, but they are not associated with congenital malformations. However, if the fetus is affected by an inborn error of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, a reduction of maternal cholesterol concentration and cholesterol transport over the placenta aggravates the phenotypic expression. Exposure to lipophilic statins in early pregnancy may be associated with a substantial risk for structural CNS defects.",

Many clinical aspects of WHS are well‐characterized; however, the cognitive‐behavioral characteristics have been rarely examined in a systematic fashion. The purpose of our study was to examine the cognitive‐behavioral features of WHS and to compare them to children with other subtelomeric deletions that also produce ID. We recruited 45 children with subtelomeric deletions and examined their cognitive‐behavioral abilities using a neuropsychological assessment battery composed of standardized instruments. Nineteen children were diagnosed with WHS and 26 children with one of three other subtelomeric deletions—11q25 (Jacobsen syndrome), deletion 2q37, and inversion duplication deletion 8p21–23. We found children with WHS to be more severely impacted cognitively than children from any of the other groups. Their overall adaptive behavior was lower as well. However, children with WHS exhibit strengths in socialization skills comparable to the levels attained by the other groups we assessed. Importantly, the proportion of children with WHS with autism or autistic‐like features is significantly lower than the rates of autism found in the other subtelomeric disorders we examined. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

As the majority of patients are sporadic, an autosomal dominant inheritance model has been postulated. Recently, whole exome sequencing (WES) emerged as a comprehensive analytical method for rare variants. We applied WES on five CSS patients and found two de novo mutations in SMARCB1 . SMARCB1 was completely sequenced in 23 CSS patients and the mutations were found in two more patients. As SMARCB1 encodes a subunit of the BAF complex functioning as a chromatin remodeling factor, mutations in 15 other subunit genes may cause CSS and thus were analyzed in 23 CSS patients. We identified heterozygous mutations in either of six genes ( SMARCA4 , SMARCB1 , SMARCA2 , SMARCE1 , ARID1A , and ARID1B ) in 20 out of 23 CSS patients. The patient with a SMARCA2 mutation was re‐evaluated and identified as having Nicolaides–Baraitser syndrome (OMIM#601358), which is similar to but different from CSS. Additionally, 49 more CSS patients were analyzed as a second cohort. Together with the first cohort, 37 out of 71 (22 plus 49) patients were found to have a mutation in either one of five BAF complex genes. Furthermore, two CSS patients were reported to have a PHF6 abnormality, which can also cause Borjeson–Forssman–Lehmann syndrome (OMIM#301900), an X‐linked intellectual disability syndrome with epilepsy and endocrine abnormalities. The current list of mutated genes in CSS is far from being complete and analysis of more patients is required. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The brain's high concentrations of cholesterol make it especially vulnerable to the cholesterol biosynthetic defect that characterizes Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome (SLOS). An attempt to characterize the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of SLOS has identified increased rates of intellectual disability, language and motor developmental delay, repeated self‐injury behaviors, sensory hyperreactivity, hyperactivity, affect dysregulation, and sleep disturbances. Some research has suggested that carriers of the gene mutation that results in SLOS display increased risk of suicidal behavior. Cholesterol dysregulation impairs neuroplasticity, which may be a mechanism underlying some of the mentioned abnormalities. Discrete positive effects have been reported with the use of cholesterol supplementation in the treatment of SLOS. Research has been limited by the small number of subjects available, and a limited understanding of lipid metabolism in the brain. Hopefully future research will help clarify the role that cholesterol plays in cognitive and behavioral abnormalities like the ones associated with SLOS. This would accelerate the development of treatments for SLOS, and perhaps also further understanding of non‐syndromic psychiatric disorders such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The most common sex chromosome aneuploidy is 47, XXY for which there is a rich literature delineating the physical and neurobehavioral phenotype. Although the more complex chromosome aneuploidies 48, XXYY, 48, XXXY, and 49, XXXXY are often compared with 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) because of shared features including tall stature and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, there is a wider spectrum of physical and cognitive abilities that have recently been delineated. The phenotypic presentation of the boys with more severe aneuploidy shares some characteristics with 47, XXY, but there are also other unique and distinctive features. Previously unappreciated intact nonverbal skills have been demonstrated in association with severe developmental dyspraxia. MRI findings of white matter hyperintensities may underlie cognitive deficits and deserve further study. This report discusses what is known about clinical variability in the XY syndromes collectively evaluated through careful multidisciplinary clinical evaluation including the clinical and neurobehavioral aspects of these conditions. Variability in clinical and cognitive functioning may reflect skewed X inactivation, mosaicism, or epigenetic factors that warrant further investigation. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Moreover, genome sequencing (GS) which interrogates the genome of a single individual at the nucleotide resolution has also been applied in genetic studies.

    "abstract": "Abstract Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental disorders with significant combined prevalence (∼1%) and high heritability. Dozens of individually rare genes and loci associated with high‐risk for ASD have been identified, which overlap extensively with genes for intellectual disability (ID). However, studies indicate that there may be hundreds of genes that remain to be identified. The advent of inexpensive massively parallel nucleotide sequencing can reveal the genetic underpinnings of heritable complex diseases, including ASD and ID. However, whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides an embarrassment of riches, where many candidate variants emerge. It has been argued that genetic variation for ASD and ID will cluster in genes involved in distinct pathways and protein complexes. For this reason, computational methods that prioritize candidate genes based on additional functional information such as protein–protein interactions or association with specific canonical or empirical pathways, or other attributes, can be useful. In this study we applied several supervised learning approaches to prioritize ASD or ID disease gene candidates based on curated lists of known ASD and ID disease genes. We implemented two network‐based classifiers and one attribute‐based classifier to show that we can rank and classify known, and predict new, genes for these neurodevelopmental disorders. We also show that ID and ASD share common pathways that perturb an overlapping synaptic regulatory subnetwork. We also show that features relating to neuronal phenotypes in mouse knockouts can help in classifying neurodevelopmental genes. Our methods can be applied broadly to other diseases helping in prioritizing newly identified genetic variation that emerge from disease gene discovery based on WES and WGS. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

However, several congenital and adult‐onset inherited myopathies also present with joint hypermobility in the context of often only mild‐to‐moderate muscle weakness and should, therefore, be included in the differential diagnosis of joint hypermobility. In fact, on the molecular level disorders within both groups represent different ends of the same spectrum of inherited extracellular matrix (ECM) disorders. In this review we will summarize the measures of joint hypermobility, illustrate molecular mechanisms these groups of disorders have in common, and subsequently discuss the clinical features of: 1) the most common connective tissue disorders with myopathic or other neuromuscular features: Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome and Loeys‐Dietz syndrome; 2) myopathy and connective tissue overlap disorders (muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) disorders), including collagen VI related dystrophies and FKBP14 related kyphoscoliotic type of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome; and 3) various (congenital) myopathies with prominent joint hypermobility including RYR1 ‐ and SEPN1 ‐related myopathy.

At the group level, mean SS declined significantly for 8 of the 12 measures and showed a slight (nonsignificant) increase or decrease for 4 measures. However, for most measures significant changes in SS were found for only a small proportion of the children, with some children evidencing significant declines and a smaller proportion evidencing significant increases. Significant SS changes were most common for adaptive behavior. For all measures, the mean magnitude of SS change was smaller for older children (>7.5 years at Time 1) than for younger children (<7.5 years at Time 1). Furthermore, correlations between Time 1 and Time 2 SSs were larger for the older cohort than for the younger cohort, indicating that SS stability was greater for older children than for younger children. Although mean SSs declined for most measures, indicating that children with WS as a group were not making the expected amount of progress relative to their general population peers who earned the same SS at Time 1, there was little evidence either of regression (loss of skills) or stagnation (failure to increase raw scores). The relations of these results to those of previous smaller-sample longitudinal studies of children with WS and the implications of the findings are considered.",

Talking with parents and patients about these conditions can be challenging given the complexity of sexual development and the sensitive nature of the information being shared. Changing approaches to disclosing or communicating information about conditions, such as DSD are reviewed as well as factors leading to revision in the diagnostic nomenclature. Building on these developments, strategies used by an established DSD team to enhance shared decision making and partnership with families and patients are presented followed by examples of how some particularly challenging, but not uncommon clinical situations were approached. The paper concludes by endorsing the importance of understanding the social and cultural needs and beliefs of the parents and patients with DSD to set the stage for effective disclosure of medical facts. To be most useful to parents and youth, medical disclosure needs to include discussion of practical implications and strategies to help families and patients digest, understand, and work with the information provided.",

    "abstract": "Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a structural brain anomaly characterized by failure of the forebrain to separate during early embryogenesis. Both genetic and environmental etiologies of HPE have been discovered over the last three decades. Traditionally, the genetic workup for HPE has been a karyotype, chromosomal microarray, and/or Sanger sequencing of select genes. The recent increased availability of next-generation sequencing has changed the molecular diagnostic landscape for HPE, associating new genes with this disorder such as FGFR1. We conducted a systematic review of the medical literature for the molecular testing of HPE for studies published in the last 20 years. We also queried known commercial diagnostic laboratories and used information on their websites to construct a list of available commercial testing. Our group released its first recommendations in 2010 and this update incorporates the technology shifts and gene discoveries over the last decade. These recommendations provide a guide for genetic diagnosis of HPE, which is paramount for patients and their families for prognosis, treatment, and genetic counseling.",

The genetic mechanisms underlying IH and the related multi-organ birth defect syndromes, PHACE (an acronym for Posterior fossa brain malformations, segmental facial Hemangiomas, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac defects, Eye anomalies, and sternal clefting or supraumbilical raphe) and LUMBAR (an acronym for Lower body hemangiomas, Urogenital anomalies, Myelopathy, Bone deformities, Anorectal malformations/Arterial anomalies, Renal anomalies) remain unsolved. With advances in next generation sequencing (NGS), genomic alterations have been identified in a wide range of vascular anomaly syndromes. We hypothesize that PHACE is a genetic disorder, caused by somatic mutations, likely in cancer genetic pathways. Identification of the genetic etiology will lead to improved diagnosis in PHACE syndrome and development of targeted therapies for IH and related congenital anomalies.",

Constitutional pathogenic variants in its component proteins have been found to cause two established overgrowth syndromes: Weaver syndrome (EZH2‐related overgrowth) and Cohen‐Gibson syndrome (EED‐related overgrowth). Imagawa et al. (2017) initially reported a singleton female with a Weaver‐like phenotype with a rare coding SUZ12 variant—the same group subsequently reported two additional affected patients. Here we describe a further 10 patients (from nine families) with rare heterozygous SUZ12 variants who present with a Weaver‐like phenotype. We report four frameshift, two missense, one nonsense, and two splice site variants. The affected patients demonstrate variable pre‐ and postnatal overgrowth, dysmorphic features, musculoskeletal abnormalities and developmental delay/intellectual disability. Some patients have genitourinary and structural brain abnormalities, and there may be an association with respiratory issues. The addition of these 10 patients makes a compelling argument that rare pathogenic SUZ12 variants frequently cause overgrowth, physical abnormalities, and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes in the heterozygous state. Pathogenic SUZ12 variants may be de novo or inherited, and are sometimes inherited from a mildly‐affected parent. Larger samples sizes will be needed to elucidate whether one or more clinically‐recognizable syndromes emerge from different variant subtypes.",

    "abstract": "For years, the genetics community has estimated the number of individual rare genetic diseases to be approximately 6,000-8,000. A commonly quoted derivation of this estimate is based on the simple addition of the number of phenotypic entries with and without confirmed molecular etiologies in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®). Here, we examine the validity of this estimation by mining the phenotypic entries in OMIM that are of likely or suspected Mendelian inheritance without a molecular cause (MIM number prefix \"%\" or \"null\"). Of the 3,204 unsolved phenotypic entries in OMIM, only two-thirds (2,034 entries) represented rare diseases. Of these, 8% were considered \"well-established\" based on their description in commonly used reference textbooks. We hypothesize based on the large proportion of entries that represent single families reported prior to 2011, that a number of the unsolved entries represent pathogenic variants in known genes. The novel gene discovery potential of these entries is therefore likely lower than originally thought. Given that the majority of the ~300 new disease-gene associations curated each year by OMIM were never associated with a \"%\" or \"null\" sign, the true scope of the rare disease atlas is likely much larger than previously anticipated.",

We report four new patients with constitutional SETD2 mutations and review nine earlier reported patients. Almost all patients presented with macrocephaly associated with advanced stature and obesity in half of the cases. In addition to these principal manifestations, neurodevelopmental disorders are common such as intellectual disability (83%), autism spectrum disorders (89%), and behavioral difficulties (100%) with aggressive outbursts (83%). A variety of features such as joint hypermobility (29%), hirsutism (33%), and naevi (50%) were also reported. Constitutional SETD2 mutations are intragenic loss‐of‐function variants with truncating (69%) and missense (31%) mutations. Functional studies are necessary to improve understanding of the pathogenicity of some missense SETD2 mutations.",

We encourage clinicians to view the cardiac diagnosis as a “phenotype” which supplements the external dysmorphology examination. When detected prenatally, severe CHDs may influence decision‐making, and postnatally, they are often the major determinants of survival. This review should be useful to geneticists, cardiologists, neonatologists, perinatal specialists, other pediatric specialists, and general pediatricians.

    "abstract": "Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) is a multisystem birth defects disorder that affects every tissue and organ system in the body. Understanding the factors that contribute to the origins, prevalence, and severity of these developmental defects provides the most direct approach for developing screens and potential treatments for individuals with CdLS. Since the majority of cases of CdLS are caused by haploinsufficiency for NIPBL (Nipped‐B‐like , which encodes a cohesin‐associated protein), we have developed mouse and zebrafish models of CdLS by using molecular genetic tools to create Nipbl ‐deficient mice and zebrafish ( Nipbl +/− mice, zebrafish nipbl morphants). Studies of these vertebrate animal models have yielded novel insights into the developmental etiology and genes/gene pathways that contribute to CdLS‐associated birth defects, particularly defects of the gut, heart, craniofacial structures, nervous system, and limbs. Studies of these mouse and zebrafish CdLS models have helped clarify how deficiency for NIPBL, a protein that associates with cohesin and other transcriptional regulators in the nucleus, affects processes important to the emergence of the structural and physiological birth defects observed in CdLS: NIPBL exerts chromosome position‐specific effects on gene expression; it influences long‐range interactions between different regulatory elements of genes; and it regulates combinatorial and synergistic actions of genes in developing tissues. Our current understanding is that CdLS should be considered as not only a cohesinopathy, but also a “transcriptomopathy,” that is, a disease whose underlying etiology is the global dysregulation of gene expression throughout the organism. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This will require overcoming multiple challenges including an inadequate workforce; development and implementation of alternate models of service delivery; integration of new technologies to improve, extend, and expand services; and support for equitable education and counseling among all populations. Genetic counselors are aptly poised to take on these challenges.

The spectrum of HPE is very broad and encompasses various neuropathological phenotypes of different severity. The recent literature has demonstrated that the phenotypic variability of HPE ranges from aprosencephaly–atelencephaly, at the most severe end, to milder forms such as the “middle interhemispheric variant” of HPE at the less severe end of the spectrum. Between them, different intermediate forms demonstrate a continuum in a wide phenotypic spectrum rather than well‐defined categories. Although the term “HPE” suggests a disorder affecting only the prosencephalon, other brain structures are involved, underlining the complexity of the malformation. Because of close spatiotemporal interactions and common signaling pathways contributing to the development of both brain and face, concomitant facial and ocular anomalies are associated with brain malformation. In this review, the characteristic neuropathological features of the various forms of HPE are described as well as their associated brain, face, and ocular malformations, to delineate the different phenotypes.",

However, not much is known about neurobehavioral problems in very young children; knowledge that could help with early identification of children at risk for suboptimal development, and that could help establish targets for early intervention. This study addressed the question of what the behavioral profile of children with SCT aged 1–5 years looks like. In total, 182 children aged 1–5 years participated in this study (N SCT =87, N nonclinical controls = 95). Recruitment and assessment took place in the Netherlands and the United States. The SCT group was recruited through prospective follow‐up (50%), information seeking parents (31%), and clinical referral (18%). Behavioral profiles were assessed with the child behavior checklist and the ages‐and‐stages social–emotional questionnaire. Levels of parent‐rated problem behavior were higher in children with SCT. Difficulties with overall social–emotional functioning were already present in 1‐year‐olds, and elevated scores were persistent across the full age range. Affective and pervasive developmental behaviors were seen in late toddlerhood and prominent at preschool age. Anxiety, attention deficit, and oppositional defiant behaviors were seen in preschool‐aged children. Within this cross‐sectional study, the developmental trajectory of affective, pervasive developmental, and oppositional defiant behaviors seemed to be different for SCT children than nonclinical controls. Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance of behavioral screening for behavioral problems in routine clinical care for children with SCT from a young age. Social–emotional problems may require special attention, as these problems seem most prominent, showing increased risk across the full age range, and with these problems occurring regardless of the timing of diagnosis, and across all three SCT karyotypes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) are the most commonly occurring aneuploidies in children with a collective prevalence rate of 1 in 500 live births. Prior research has documented SCAs are associated with an increased risk for early expressive language and gross motor delays, learning disorders, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and executive function problems. Although SCAs have been historically underdiagnosed in young children, recent advances in noninvasive prenatal testing have resulted in an increasing nationwide cohort of infants with confirmed diagnoses. Consequently, early childhood support systems must prepare for an influx of children with known risks for associated developmental delays and potential school problems. This national survey aimed to update our understanding of current early childhood intervention services for young children with SCA in the United States and to describe parent perspectives and priorities. Descriptive statistics, chi‐square tests, and logistic regression models controlling for parent education revealed a majority of respondents reported receiving public early childhood intervention services with speech therapy as the most common service. There were significant differences in early childhood intervention services by timing of diagnosis (prenatal vs. postnatal), number of sex chromosomes (trisomy vs. tetra/pentasomy), and geographic location. Parents described interventions as desirable and effective yet also difficult to obtain due to issues with the SCA phenotype, lack of provider knowledge, and challenges navigating the intervention systems. Results support the need for enhanced provider training in SCAs, policy change for early childhood intervention qualification criteria for SCA conditions, and collaboration between medical and early childhood settings.",

    "abstract": "Klinefelter syndrome is highly underdiagnosed and diagnosis is often delayed. With the introduction of non-invasive prenatal screening, the diagnostic pattern will require an updated description of the clinical and biochemical presentation of infants with Klinefelter syndrome. In the first months of life, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)-axis is transiently activated in healthy males during the so-called minipuberty. This period represents a \"window of opportunity\" for evaluation of the HPG-axis before puberty and without stimulation tests. Infants with Klinefelter syndrome present with a hormonal surge during the minipuberty. However, only a limited number of studies exist, and the results are contradictory. Further studies are needed to clarify whether infants with Klinefelter syndrome present with impaired testosterone production during the minipuberty. The aim of this review is to describe the clinical and biochemical characteristics of the neonate and infant with Klinefelter syndrome with special focus on the minipuberty and to update the clinical recommendations for Klinefelter syndrome during infancy.",

    "abstract": "X‐chromosome inactivation generally results in dosage equivalence for expression of X‐linked genes between 46,XY males and 46,XX females. The 20–30% of genes that escape silencing are thus candidates for having a role in the phenotype of Turner syndrome. Understanding which genes escape from silencing, and how they avoid this chromosome‐wide inactivation is therefore an important step toward understanding Turner Syndrome. We have examined the mechanism of escape using a previously reported knock‐in of a BAC containing the human escape gene RPS4X in mouse. We now demonstrate that escape from inactivation for RPS4X is already established by embryonic Day 9.5, and that both silencing and escape are faithfully maintained across the lifespan. No overt abnormalities were observed for transgenic mice up to 1 year of age despite robust transcription of the human RPS4X gene with no detectable downregulation of the mouse homolog. However, there was no significant increase in protein levels, suggesting translational compensation in the mouse. Finally, while many of the protein‐coding genes have been assessed for their inactivation status, less is known about the X‐linked RNA genes, and we propose that for many microRNA genes their inactivation status can be predicted as they are intronic to genes for which the inactivation status is known.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aortopathies encompass a variety of inherited and acquired pathologies that increase risk of life‐threatening dissection or rupture. Identifying individuals with hereditary thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (HTAAD) for longitudinal monitoring, medical therapy, or elective and preventative repair is paramount to reduce risk of cardiovascular‐related mortality and complications from dissection and rupture. Over the past couple of decades, pathogenic variants in numerous genes have been identified in relation to HTAAD. The genetic diagnosis can help stratify patient risk and provide guidance on medical treatment, timing of prophylactic surgical repair, as well as longitudinal surveillance and imaging. Implicated genes and their associated proteins have been found to act on a diverse variety of pathways, cells and structural components linked to transforming growth factor beta (TGF‐β) signaling pathways, disruption of the vascular smooth muscle cell contractile apparatus, and primary disruption of extracellular matrix homeostasis. This review describes relevant genetic variants that may help identify and guide the management of hereditary thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most frequent sex chromosomal aneuploidy. The karyotype 47,XXY originates from either paternal or maternal meiotic nondisjunction during gametogenesis. KS males are very likely to exhibit marked gonadal dysfunctions, presenting both in severely attenuated spermatogenesis as well as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. In addition, neurocognitive and psychosocial impairments, as well as cardiovascular, metabolic and bone disorders are often found in KS and might explain for an increased morbidity/mortality. All conditions in KS are likely to be induced by both gene overdosage effects resulting from supernumerary X‐chromosomal genes as well as testosterone deficiency. Notwithstanding, the clinical features are highly variable between KS men. Symptoms can become obvious at infancy, childhood, or adolescence. However, the majority of KS subjects is diagnosed during adulthood. KS adolescents require specific attention regarding pubertal development, in order to exploit their remaining fertility potential and allow for timely and tailored testosterone replacement. The chances for sperm retrieval might decline with age and could be hampered by testosterone replacement; therefore, cryostorage of spermatozoa is an option during adolescence, before the decompensation of endocrine and exocrine testicular functions becomes more overt. Sperm from semen or surgically retrieved, in combination with intracytoplasmic sperm injection enables KS males to become biological fathers of healthy children. The aim of this article is to present the current knowledge on KS, to guide clinical care and to highlight research needs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Congenital heart defect is one of the most common structural birth defects in the human population. It is highly associated with heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left–right patterning of visceral organ situs. Large scale mouse forward genetics have led to the finding of a central role for cilia in CHD pathogenesis, with some cilia and non‐cilia mutations causing CHD with heterotaxy. Interestingly, many of the mutations causing CHD with heterotaxy can give rise to three laterality outcomes comprising normal situs solitus, mirror symmetric situs inversus totalis, or randomized situs with heterotaxy. Given CHD is largely observed only with heterotaxy, this suggests a new paradigm is needed for investigating the genetics of CHD associated with heterotaxy. Furthermore, analysis of data from multiple large birth cohorts have independently confirmed a broader involvement of laterality disturbance in CHD. This was demonstrated by the common cooccurrence of rare laterality defects with CHD lesions of a wide spectrum. These findings suggest left–right patterning is tightly intertwined with the developmental processes that regulate cardiac morphogenesis and its disturbance may contribute to all types of CHD even in the absence of laterality defects.",

We describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of 10 patients from eight Japanese families with PROM1 ‐associated retinal disorder ( PROM1 ‐RD) in a nationwide cohort. A literature review of PROM1 ‐RD in the Japanese population was also performed. The median age at onset/examination of 10 patients was 31.0 (range, 10–45)/44.5 (22–73) years. All 10 patients showed atrophic macular changes. Seven patients (70.0%) had spared fovea to various degrees, approximately half of whom had maintained visual acuity. Generalized cone (−rod) dysfunction was demonstrated in all nine subjects with available electrophysiological data. Three PROM1 variants were identified in this study: one recurrent disease‐causing variant (p.Arg373Cys), one novel putative disease‐causing variant (p.Cys112Arg), and one novel variant of uncertain significance (VUS; p.Gly53Asp). Characteristic features of macular atrophy with generalized cone‐dominated retinal dysfunction were shared among all 10 subjects with PROM1 ‐RD, and the presence of foveal sparing was crucial in maintaining visual acuity. Together with the three previously reported variants [p.R373C, c.1551+1G&gt;A (pathogenic), p.Asn580His (likely benign)] in the literature of Japanese patients, one prevalent missense variant (p.Arg373Cys, 6/9 families, 66.7%) detected in multiple studies was determined in the Japanese population, which was also frequently detected in the European population.",

With a prevalence of 2–19 per 100,000 live births, coloboma, and microphthalmia, an associated ocular disorder, represent up to 10% of childhood blindness. It manifests due to the failure of choroid fissure closure during eye development, and it is a part of a spectrum of ocular disorders that include microphthalmia and anophthalmia. Use of genetic approaches from classical pedigree analyses to next generation sequencing has identified more than 40 loci that are associated with the causality of ocular coloboma. As we have expanded studies to include singleton cases, hereditability has been very challenging to prove. As such, researchers over the past 20 years, have unraveled the complex interrelationship amongst these 40 genes using vertebrate model organisms. Such research has greatly increased our understanding of eye development. These genes function to regulate initial specification of the eye field, migration of retinal precursors, patterning of the retina, neural crest cell biology, and activity of head mesoderm. This review will discuss the discovery of loci using patient data, their investigations in animal models, and the recent advances stemming from animal models that shed new light in patient diagnosis.",

The success of epidemiologic surveillance depends on numerous factors, including the accuracy of the rates available in the base period, wide population coverage, and short periodicity of analysis. This study aims to describe the Latin American network of congenital malformation surveillance: ReLAMC, created to increase epidemiologic surveillance in Latin America. We describe the main steps, tasks, strategies used, and preliminary results. From 2017 to 2019, five national registries (Argentina [RENAC], Brazil [SINASC/SIM‐BRS], Chile [RENACH], Costa Rica [CREC], Paraguay [RENADECOPY‐PNPDC]), six regional registries (Bogotá [PVSDC‐Bogota], Cali [PVSDC‐Cali], Maule [RRMC SSM], Nicaragua [SVDC], Nuevo‐León [ReDeCon HU], São Paulo [SINASC/SIM‐MSP]) and the ECLAMC hospital network sent data to ReLAMC on a total population of 9,152,674 births, with a total of 101,749 malformed newborns (1.1%; 95% CI 1.10–1.12). Of the 9,000,651 births in countries covering both live and stillbirths, 88,881 were stillborn (0.99%; 95% CI 0.98–0.99), and among stillborns, 6,755 were malformed (7.61%; 95% CI 7.44–7.79). The microcephaly rate was 2.45 per 10,000 births (95% CI 2.35–2.55), hydrocephaly 3.03 (2.92–3.14), spina bifida 2.89 (2.78–3.00), congenital heart defects 15.53 (15.27–15.79), cleft lip 2.02 (1.93–2.11), cleft palate and lip 2.77 (2.66–2.88), talipes 2.56 (2.46–2.67), conjoined twins 0.16 (0.14–0.19), and Down syndrome 5.33 (5.18–5.48).

Reports link MCAD with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), and with primary immune deficiencies such as complement and immunoglobulin deficiencies (Ig Def). This study assesses the concurrence of these syndromes. We undertook a cohort analysis of patients seen in a community-based Allergy/Immunology clinic from 2015 to 2019. We searched for diagnostic codes for Ig Def disorders, hypermobility syndrome, hypermobile/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and MCADs. Of 974 patients with suspected MCAD, 449 (46%) had a diagnosis of MCAD; 496 (51%) of cases had a combination of at least two of hEDS/HSD, MCAD, and Ig Def. Ig Def was present in 417 (43%) of patients; 188 (19.3%) had hEDS/HSD with an Ig Def with or without MCAD and accounted for 45% of all the cases with Ig Def. Of 974 cases, 101 (10%) had hEDS/HSD and MCAD; 207 (21%) had Ig Def and MCAD; 7 (0.7%) had Ig Def and hEDS/HSD; and 181 (19%) had a combination of all three syndromes. Most patients (74%) with these comorbidities were female. The presence of MCAD and Ig Def should be explored in patients with hEDS/HSD. Identifying underlying contributors to recurrent/chronic inflammation and tissue injury is needed to tailor and personalize therapies. This, in turn, can reduce tissue damage, iatrogenic intervention, and optimize health outcomes.",

NBS for SMA was performed using real time PCR assays from February 2019 through February 2020 in a pilot phase of screening. This method continued as part of our official state panel, and here we describe the pilot period as well as the first year of standard screening through February 2021. Medical records of infants with a positive NBS were reviewed for time to confirmation and neurologic evaluation, SMN2 copy number, clinical information, and treatment. Descriptive statistics were applied. Of the 301,418 samples screened, there were 15 true positive (eight males) and 24 false positive cases. One patient was missed due to human error early in the pilot phase and presented after symptom onset. The incidence of SMA in Georgia is approximately 1 in 18,840 births per year. After the pilot phase, the false positive rate was found to be so low that all patients who test positive were immediately referred to neurology for further care. Four patients died prior to intervention. Ten patients received intervention. Gene therapy was the preferred treatment. One patient was lost to follow-up; another was clinically followed. In conclusion, trends for treated patients show improved or stable motor function. Long-term follow-up will help determine the durability of treatment.",

DMD is a multi-system disease resulting in muscle weakness with progressive deterioration of skeletal, heart, and smooth muscle, and learning disabilities. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in the DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin protein, cause dystrophinopathy. All males with a P/LP variant in the X-linked DMD gene are expected to be affected. Two to 20% of female heterozygotes with a P/LP variant develop symptoms of dystrophinopathy ranging from mild muscle weakness to significant disability similar to Becker muscular dystrophy. Recently, with improvements in therapies and testing methodology, there is stronger evidence supporting newborn screening (NBS) for DMD for males and females because females may also develop symptoms. A consented pilot study to screen newborns for DMD was initiated in New York State (NYS) and conducted from 2019 to 2021. The identification of female carriers and the realization of the subsequent uncertainty of providers concerning follow-up during the pilot led to the development of algorithms for screening and diagnosis of carrier females, including both NBS and cascade molecular testing of family members.",

Vascular/arterial fragility was observed in 4/15 individuals (including one individual with an original diagnosis of hEDS), which underscores the unique clinical surveillance and management needs in these patients. In comparison to previously described OIEDS1/2, we observed differentiating features that should be considered to refine currently proposed criteria for genetic testing in OIEDS, which will be beneficial for diagnosis and management. Additionally, these results highlight the importance of gene-specific knowledge for informed variant classification and point to a potential genetic resolution (COL1A2) for some cases of clinically diagnosed hEDS.",

The goal of this cross‐sectional interview study with nearly 600 participants was to document and compare the experiences, attitudes, and beliefs of persons with strictly genetic conditions to those of persons with or at risk for other serious medical conditions in terms of the degree to which they have disclosed to others that they have the condition and their views about how others ought to maintain the confidentiality of that information. While almost all participants reported that family members knew about their condition, results suggest participants want to control that disclosure themselves and do not want doctors to disclose information to family members without their knowledge. Similarly, participants do not think family members should be able to get information about them without their knowledge but feel overwhelmingly that it is a person's responsibility to disclose information about hereditary conditions to other family members. Ambivalence about confidentiality was evident: while most participants did not mind doctors sharing information with other doctors when it was for their benefit, the majority also felt that doctors should be punished for releasing information without their permission. The views and experiences reported here generally did not differ by whether participants had genetic versus nongenetic conditions, suggesting that the extensive policy focus on genetic information may be unwarranted. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Obesity is thought to have a genetic component with the estimates of heritability ranging from 0.25–0.40. As part of an ongoing study of obesity in the Old Order Amish, seven two‐ and three‐generation families (157 individuals) were assessed for 21 traits related to obesity, including body mass index (BMI) and BMI‐percentile (a standardized distribution of BMI adjusted for age and sex). Genotyping was performed using a panel of 384 short‐tandem repeat markers. In this sample, the estimates of heritability ranged from 0.16–0.31 for BMI and from 0.40–0.52 for BMI‐percentile. Model‐independent linkage analysis identified candidate regions on chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 8, and 11. Given that several markers on 7q were significant for both BMI and BMI‐percentile ( P ≤ 0.001) and that the structural locus for leptin was located on 7q, this region was considered to be the primary candidate region. Subsequent typing of additional flanking markers on 7q corroborated the original findings. Tests of intrafamilial association for alleles at markers in this candidate region were significant at similar levels. Although there is some evidence for linkage and association in the region containing leptin, there appears to be stronger evidence for linkage ( P ≤ 0.001) and association ( P ≤ 0.00001) with BMI in a region 10–15 cM further downstream of leptin, flanked by markers D7S1804 and D7S3070 with peak values from D7S495–D7S1798. Evidence from linkage and association studies suggests that this region (D7S1804–D7S3070) may be responsible, at least in part, for variation in BMI and BMI‐percentile in the Old Order Amish.

    "abstract": "Abstract As genetic awareness spreads among healthcare providers and the general public, and evidence mounts to show the efficacy of cancer control methods, referrals to cancer genetic counseling services for risk assessment are becoming more common. However, few studies have examined referral patterns to genetics and even less is known about referral uptake to clinical cancer genetic counseling. We investigated outcome of genetics referral in 43 affected women attending a breast cancer treatment program who were referred based on having BRCA mutation carrier risks ≥10%. Within 6 months, of the 36 women we were able to recontact, 13 (36%) came to an appointment at the cancer genetic counseling clinic (Acceptors), 10 (27%) said they intended to come in the future (Intenders), and 13 (36%) said they would not consider genetic counseling (Decliners). Referral uptake was framed by elements of the Transtheoretical model (TTM) to determine if decisional balance scores (DBSs), a summary of an individual's “Pro” and “Con” opinions related to genetic testing, correlated with their decision to follow through. Mean DBS's were strongly negative for the Decliner group (−7.4), weakly negative for the Intender group (−1.1), and positive for the Acceptor group (5.4). The difference in the DBS along the continuum was due more to the mean “Con” score decreasing, rather than the mean “Pro” score increasing. Theoretical frameworks are needed to study adherence to referral for cancer genetic counseling. Stage‐based theories may have a role to play. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alcohol is an important element in the causal chain of risk for fetal, infant, and childhood mortality. Mortality risk is influenced by interactions of alcohol with other environmental and genetic factors and temporal periods of susceptibility. In this paper we discuss four time periods (preconceptual, gestational, infancy, and childhood) where alcohol use may create a context of risk. Alcohol use in one period increases the risk of alcohol use in subsequent periods. Gestational alcohol use can influence risk of mortality from abuse of mother/fetus, can cause other adverse outcomes, and can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In infancy alcohol use can increase risk from impairment of arousal in adults who use alcohol. Infants with gestational exposure can be behaviorally difficult with sleep disturbance, irritability, and colic. This can increase the risk of harm or death, especially during periods of caretakers' alcohol use. Caretakers' alcohol use and smoking are strongly correlated. The all‐cause mortality rate in people diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is over 5%. All‐cause mortality in siblings of diagnosed cases of FAS is increased 530% compared to siblings of matched controls. We recommend that a context of alcohol use be considered as a marker for multifactorial risk in all fetal, infant, and child deaths. A schema to collect data on alcohol use is provided to increase awareness of alcohol use as an environmental risk marker for mortality. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The diagnosis of an infant, especially a newborn, with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is difficult due to the fact that not all of the features are apparent at that time. Many cases are also missed due to inadequate knowledge of the mother's drinking pattern and because of the examining physician's lack of experience with the disorder. While conducting a study of the use of maternal blood markers to determine alcohol use in pregnancy, we have evaluated systematically the effects of alcohol on the newborn infant. We have developed a facial scoring system consisting of six of the features commonly seen in children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and present preliminary data about its use. By using a cutoff of four or more of these six features, there is a significant correlation with the presence of these features and the mother's self‐reported alcohol use. In addition, there has been no significant difference in the frequency of positive scores between newborns of Caucasian or Black ancestry. We propose that this system may be useful in the assessment of newborn infants at high risk because of alcohol exposure during pregnancy. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Thus, with respect to growth deficits, there is no safe level of drinking during pregnancy. Alcohol exposure during gestation causes growth deficits among the offspring at birth and during infancy. At older ages, however, growth deficits are reported in some, though not all, studies. Exposed offspring who grow up in more privileged environments are apparently able to make up their growth deficits, while those raised in less optimal circumstances do not. This means that there is an interaction between the environment in which a child is raised and the expression of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. The long-term implications of growth deficits are not yet well understood.",

Antenatal imaging studies have been performed that attempt to quantify the degree of hypoplasia and its impact on infant prognosis. Prenatal and perinatal growth of the lung and vasculature are interdependent and their continued coordinated growth is critical for survival after birth in this patient population. Lung protection strategies appear to improve survival in newborns with diaphragmatic hernia, but a subset of infants remain who demonstrate sufficiently severe lung hypoplasia that we are unable to provide support long‐term after birth. Fetal intervention is a strategy designed to enhance fetal lung growth towards improving survival in this most severely affected group, though other therapies to enhance postnatal lung and vascular growth should be concurrently investigated. However, any of these interventions will require careful selection of those infants at risk for poor outcome and thorough follow up, since long‐term morbidity is significant in children with diaphragmatic hernia. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While newborn screening (NBS) programs have historically relied on presumptive benefit in deciding when to implement new tests, experience has demonstrated that this approach can lead to screening tests that lack efficacy or, worse yet, cause harm. Population‐based NBS research provides an opportunity to evaluate safety and effectiveness of potential tests prior to widespread implementation. Using the example of Pompe disease, we argue that waiving the requirement for informed consent is appropriate for research evaluating the screening phase of potential NBS tests when data support the potential health benefits of testing and when other research safeguards are present. The regulatory requirement for informed consent can be waived if a research study meets criteria of minimal risk, protecting rights and welfare, and practicability. In population‐based NBS research, the main risks are related to false positive results and results with ambiguous implications for treatment—risks that are comparable to those posed by many tests newly added to NBS programs without prior population‐based NBS research. Waiving the informed consent requirement facilitates the development of flexible strategies for informing and educating parents about NBS research that reflect the logistics of population‐based NBS screening. A strict interpretation of the regulatory requirement of informed consent may create significant logistical and financial barriers to adequate evaluation of NBS tests. Without a broader interpretation of this regulatory requirement in NBS research for which there is evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit from treatment, we may create incentives for the implementation of inadequately evaluated NBS tests. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the 1960s, patient advocacy groups were instrumental in efforts to mandate state testing of newborns for phenylketonuria (PKU), a recessively inherited disorder of phenylalanine metabolism. Advocacy groups have continued to actively lobby for the expansion of screening to other conditions detectable in newborns and, currently, for states' adoption of a uniform core screening panel. They have also been generally favorable to the offer of fee‐based supplemental screening services. In the early years of newborn screening, groups such as the National Association for Retarded Children (NARC) were strongly imbued with a public‐health ethic. This ethic has apparently eroded over time as the result of both broad social changes and the increasing entanglement of such groups with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. A history of newborn screening reveals both continuities and discontinuities in the agendas and funding of patient advocacy groups and in their rhetorical strategies. In particular, it demonstrates that there have always been tensions as well as partnerships with medical and other professionals, although the nature and intensity of the former have been affected by advocacy groups' increasing numbers, resources, and cultural authority. It also illuminates differences that have emerged as advocacy groups have informally allied with industry and adopted new rationales in support of access to testing. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Thanks to the major advances made in medical care and technology, many children with childhood onset diseases and/or genetic syndromes survive to adulthood. These children are at risk of not being provided with adequate healthcare as they reach adulthood. Healthcare transition is an essential part of healthcare provision, referred to as the shift from one type of healthcare to another. In Maastricht, we developed a transition/out clinic led by a medical doctor specialized in persons with intellectual disability (ID), together with a clinical geneticist. We aim to coordinate healthcare issues based on guidelines if available. Also questions concerning living, daily activities, relations, sexuality, and sterilization can be discussed. The aging process of persons with ID has been a topic of interest in recent years. Little is known about the aging process of people with specific syndromes, except for persons with Down syndrome. We present some data of a recent questionnaire study in persons with Prader–Willi syndrome. In only 50% in persons with a clinical diagnosis genetic test results could be reported. The majority of persons were obese. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, skin problems, sleep apnea, and hormonal problems like osteoporosis and hypothyroidism were common. Psychiatric problems were frequent, especially in the persons with uniparental disomy. Osteoporosis and sleep apnoea seem to be underestimated. Further longitudinal research is necessary for a better understanding of the aging process in PWS. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

To assess the impact of influencing AED prescribing practices on spina bifida and cleft palate we searched the literature for estimates of the association between valproic acid or carbamazepine use during pregnancy and these defects and summarized the associations using meta-analyses. We estimated distributions of the prevalence of valproic acid and carbamazepine use among women of childbearing age based on analyses of four data sets. We estimated the attributable fractions and the number of children born with each defect that could be prevented annually in the United States if valproic acid and carbamazepine were not used during pregnancy. The summary odds ratio estimate for the association between valproic acid and spina bifida was 11.9 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 4.0-21.2); for valproic acid and cleft palate 5.8 (95% UI: 3.3-9.5); for carbamazepine and spina bifida 3.6 (95% UI: 1.3-7.8); and for carbamazepine and cleft palate 2.4 (95% UI: 1.1-4.5) in the United States. Approximately 40 infants (95% UI: 10-100) with spina bifida and 35 infants (95% UI: 10-70) with cleft palate could be born without these defects each year if valproic acid were not used during pregnancy; 5 infants (95% UI: 0-15) with spina bifida and 5 infants (95% UI: 0-15) with cleft palate could be born without these defects each year if carbamazepine were not used during pregnancy.

It is the severest facial expression of the holoprosencephaly (HPE) spectrum. This study describes the prevalence, associated malformations, and maternal characteristics among cases with cyclopia. Data originated in 20 Clearinghouse (ICBDSR) affiliated birth defect surveillance systems, reported according to a single pre‐established protocol. A total of 257 infants with cyclopia were identified. Overall prevalence was 1 in 100,000 births (95%CI: 0.89–1.14), with only one program being out of range. Across sites, there was no correlation between cyclopia prevalence and number of births (r = 0.08; P = 0.75) or proportion of elective termination of pregnancy (r = −0.01; P = 0.97). The higher prevalence of cyclopia among older mothers (older than 34) was not statistically significant. The majority of cases were liveborn (122/200; 61%) and females predominated (male/total: 42%). A substantial proportion of cyclopias (31%) were caused by chromosomal anomalies, mainly trisomy 13. Another 31% of the cases of cyclopias were associated with defects not typically related to HPE, with more hydrocephalus, heterotaxia defects, neural tube defects, and preaxial reduction defects than the chromosomal group, suggesting the presence of ciliopathies or other unrecognized syndromes. Cyclopia is a very rare defect without much variability in prevalence by geographic location. The heterogeneous etiology with a high prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities, and female predominance in HPE, were confirmed, but no effect of increased maternal age or association with twinning was observed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The next two sections summarize recent research on the diverse roles of religious and spiritual beliefs in genetic decisions and challenges to conducting spiritual assessments in genetic counseling. Based on these findings, religious and spiritual beliefs are posited as serving essentially as a heuristic that some people will utilize in responding to their genetic risks. In the interests of helping such clients make informed decisions, a limited spiritual assessment is recommended and described. Some of the challenges and risks associated with this limited assessment are discussed. Since some religious and spiritual beliefs can conflict with the values of medicine, some decisions will remain problematic. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "From data collected via a large international collaborative study, we have constructed a growth chart for patients with molecularly confirmed congenital spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia (SEDC) and other COL2A1 related dysplasias. The growth chart is based on longitudinal height measurements of 79 patients with glycine substitutions in the triple-helical domain of COL2A1. In addition, measurements of 27 patients with other molecular defects, such as arginine to cysteine substitutions, splice mutations, and mutations in the C-terminal propeptide have been plotted on the chart. Height of the patients progressively deviate from that of normal children: compared to normal WHO charts, the mean length/height is -2.6 SD at birth, -4.2 SD at 5 years, and -5.8 SD in adulthood. The mean adult height (male and female combined) of patients with glycine substitutions in the triple-helical region is 138.2 cm but there is a large variation. Patients with glycine to cysteine substitutions tend to cluster within the upper part of the chart, while patients with glycine to serine or valine substitutions are situated between +1 SD and -1 SD. Patients with carboxy-terminal glycine substitutions tend to be shorter than patients with amino-terminal substitutions, while patients with splice mutations are relatively tall. However, there are exceptions and specific mutations can have a strong or a relatively mild negative effect on growth. The observation of significant difference in adult height between affected members of the same family indicates that height remains a multifactorial trait even in the presence of a mutation with a strong dominant effect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common malformation of the forebrain, resulting from a failure to completely septate the left and right hemispheres at the rostral end of the neural tube. Because of the tissue interactions that drive head development, these forebrain defects are typically accompanied by midline deficiencies of craniofacial structures. Early events in setting up tissue precursors of the head, as well as later interactions between these tissues, are critical for normal head formation. Defects in either process can result in HPE. Signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a family of secreted cytokines, generally plays negative roles in early stages of head formation, and thus must be attenuated in multiple contexts to ensure proper forebrain and craniofacial development. Chordin and Noggin are endogenous, extracellular antagonists of BMP signaling that promote the normal organization of the forebrain and face. Mouse mutants with reduced levels of both factors display mutant phenotypes remarkably analogous to the range of malformations seen in human HPE sequence. Chordin and Noggin function in part by antagonizing the inhibitory effects of BMP signaling on the Sonic hedgehog and Nodal pathways, genetic lesions in each being associated with human HPE. Study of Chordin;Noggin mutant mice is helping us to understand the molecular, cellular, and genetic pathogenesis of HPE and associated malformations. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Sex assignment at birth remains one of the most clinically challenging and controversial topics in 46,XY disorders of sexual development (DSD). This is particularly challenging in deficiency of 5‐alpha reductase type 2 given that external genitalia are typically undervirilized at birth but typically virilize at puberty to a variable degree. Historically, most individuals with 5‐alpha reductase deficiency were raised females. However, reports that over half of patients who underwent a virilizing puberty adopted an adult male gender identity have challenged this practice. Consensus guidelines on assignment of sex of rearing at birth are equivocal or favor male assignment in the most virilized cases. While a male sex of rearing assignment may avoid lifelong hormonal therapy and/or allow the potential for fertility, female sex assignment may be more consistent with external anatomy in the most severely undervirilized cases. Herein, we describe five patients with 46,XY DSD due 5‐alpha‐reductase type 2 deficiency, all with a severe phenotype. An inter‐disciplinary DSD medical team at one of two academic centers evaluated each patient. This case series illustrates the complicated decision‐making process of assignment of sex of rearing at birth in 5‐alpha reductase type 2 deficiency and the challenges that arise when the interests of the child, parental wishes, recommendations of the medical team, and state law collide.",

We present a cohort of 40 affected males, focusing on musculoskeletal problems. Subjects were participants in an annual 49er family support group meeting. Children were examined in a multidisciplinary clinic by a pediatric neurologist and geneticist, a pediatric orthopedist, a neurodevelopmentalist, and two physical therapists. The patient data were collected from this clinic from 2004 to 2012. All patients were required to have karyotypes that confirmed the presence of XXXXY. There was a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, particularly hypotonia (34 patients [85%]), radioulnar synostosis (30 [75%]), pes planus (26 [65%]), asymmetric hip rotation (27 [67.5%]), and clinodactyly (24 [60%]). Other, less common lower‐extremity disorders, included, 5 patients (12.5%) with unilateral club foot, 5 boys (12.5%) with pes cavus, 10 patients (25%) genu valgum and 2 children with genu varus (5%). To our knowledge, this is the first large cohort of boys with 49, XXXXY that focuses on musculoskeletal disorders. There was an increased incidence of hypotonia, clubfoot, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, radioulnar synostosis, and pes planus compared to the normative population. Boys with 49, XXXXY would benefit from multidisciplinary evaluations, particularly from pediatric orthopedists, physical therapists, neurologists, and geneticists for appropriate medical care. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "CHARGE syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that is primarily diagnosed based on clinical features, with genetic testing available for confirmation. The CHARGE mnemonic stands for some of the common characteristics: coloboma, heart defects, atresia/stenosis of the choanae, retardation of growth/development, genitourinary anomalies, and ear abnormalities (CHARGE). However, many of the common clinical features are not captured by this mnemonic, including cranial nerve dysfunction, considered by some to be one of the major diagnostic criteria. Over 90% of individuals experience feeding and gastrointestinal dysfunction, which carries great morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review is to examine the nature of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and feeding difficulties in CHARGE syndrome, focusing on their underlying pathology, associated investigations, and available treatment options. We also provide information on available tools (for parents, clinicians, and researchers) that are important additions to the lifelong healthcare management of every individual with CHARGE syndrome. We review how cranial nerve dysfunction is one of the most important characteristics underlying the pervasive GI and feeding dysfunction, and discuss the need for future research on gut innervation and motility in this genetic disorder.",

Although natural pregnancies have been reported in 4–7% of TS patients, most women will need assisted reproductive technologies (ART) with oocyte donation. The main issue is the maternal mortality rate that is higher than in the general population. It is related to cardiovascular anomalies and particularly aortic dissection. TS, per se, is not a contraindication for pregnancy, but a multidisciplinary screening is mandatory before initiating a pregnancy. It includes repeated aortic diameters evaluation, blood pressure measurement and biological testing evaluating thyroid and liver functions, as well as blood glucose level. In order to make the pregnancy safe, contraindications of pregnancy should be respected and identification of high‐risk patients for cardiovascular events should be performed. Hypertension and pre‐eclampsia prevention may benefit from beta‐blockers and aspirin, respectively. Collaborations between endocrinologists, cardiologists, and obstetricians are mandatory during pregnancy and even in the postpartum period. Counseling the patients about the risks of pregnancy, screening them and spreading the international guidelines to physicians taking care of patients with TS are the three pillars of a safe pregnancy.",

In this study we present findings from a two and a half year follow-up of the characteristics associated with ASD in three syndromes: Cornelia de Lange (CdLS), Fragile X (FXS), and Cri du Chat (CdCS). Parents and carers of 251 individuals (CdLS=67, CdCS=42, and FXS=142) completed the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) at Time 1 (T1) and again two and a half years later (T2). The FXS and CdLS groups were more likely to meet the cut-offs for both autism and ASD and show greater severity of ASD related behaviors, at both T1 and T2, compared to the CdCS group. Older individuals (>15yrs) with CdLS were more likely to meet the cut off for ASD than younger individuals (≤15 yrs) with the syndrome and more likely to show greater severity of social impairments. In FXS repetitive behaviors were found to become less prominent with age and in CdCS social impairments were reported to be more severe with age. There were no significant changes between T1 and T2 in the severity of ASD characteristics in the CdCS and CdLS groups. The FXS group showed significantly fewer repetitive behaviors and less severe impairments in social interaction over this time frame. The findings suggest that while there may be similarities in overall severity and presentation of ASD characteristics in CdLS and FXS, these characteristics have divergent patterns of development within these groups.",

    "abstract": "Care of the child born with trisomy 13 or 18 has evolved over the past few decades, leading to increased healthcare utilization. We hypothesized that there has been an increase in procedures across all intensity types, including major, invasive procedures. We performed a retrospective-cohort study of children with trisomy 13 or 18 from 1990 to 2014 in a quaternary, free-standing children's hospital. Children were identified using ICD-9 billing diagnoses. Procedures were identified during these encounters and categorized by intensity (major, intermediate, or minor). One hundred thirty-two children with trisomy 13 or 18 were identified. In children with trisomy 13, major procedures increased from period 1 (1990-1997) to period 3 (2006-2013) from 0.11 to 0.78 procedures per patient. For trisomy 18, the increase between the time periods was from 0.14 to 1.33 procedures per patient. By the end of the study period, nearly all trisomy 13 patients had a major procedure and the majority of those with trisomy 18 had undergone a major procedure. Estimated 1-year survival for those with a major procedure was 30% and 22% for trisomies 13 and 18, respectively. In conclusion, there was an increasing rate of procedures per patient of all intensity levels over the 25-year study period. Given differences in characteristics in those with trisomies 13 and 18, and effects of intervention on survival, an individualized approach to care of these patients should be employed by parents and healthcare providers, using factors such as trisomy type, infant gender, co-morbidities, and parental preference. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of genetic and genomic technologies has greatly boosted medical genetic researches and clinical services worldwide. Since last century, genetic counseling in the United States has helped individuals and families understand, accept, and cope with their genetic issues. This fledging profession, which is in essence a branch of social work, emerged in China relatively late but has rapidly grown over the last few years. We believe that genetic counseling will continue to play a pivotal role in building communication channels between medical doctors and their patients, the government and the general public, and social organizations and their customers in China. The growth of genetic counseling aims to enable patients and family members to make informed decision which in turn will lead to the reduction of the birth prevalence of severe congenital anomalies and genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC, is a clinical sign defined as congenital contractures of at least two joint levels. These joint contractures are always secondary to diminished fetal movement which can have numerous causes that affect any part of the anatomical structures implicated in movement: the central nervous system, the anterior horn cell, the nerve, the neuromuscular junction, the muscle, or the joint itself. Make a precise diagnosis of the cause in a patient with multiple joint contractures is therefore challenging. The aim of this article is to summarize the use and diagnostic value of common examinations and analyses performed postnatally in patients affected by AMC from a literature review. We also compare this data with results from our clinical practice. Even though it is difficult to give precise guidelines today, it appears that genetic studies, such as whole exome or genome analysis in all patients and chromosomal microarray analysis in patients with intellectual disability and AMC should be preferred as first tier investigations over EMG and muscle biopsy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Arthrogryposis or AMC, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, is defined as multiple congenital joint contractures in more than two joints and in different body areas. The common cause of all AMC is lack of movement in utero, which in turn can have different causes, one of which is CNS involvement. Intellectual disability/CNS involvement is found in approximately 25% of all AMC. AMC with CNS involvement includes a large number of genetic syndromes. So far, more than 400 genes have been identified as linked to AMC, with and without CNS involvement. A number of neonatally lethal syndromes and syndromes resulting in severe disability due to CNS malfunction belong to this group of syndromes. There are several X‐linked disorders with AMC, which are primarily related to intellectual disability. A number of neuromuscular disorders may include AMC and CNS/brain involvement. Careful clinical evaluation by a geneticist and a pediatrician/pediatric neurologist is the first step in making a specific diagnosis. Further investigations may include MRI of the brain and spinal cord, electroencephalogram, blood chemistry for muscle enzymes, other organ investigations (ophtalmology, cardiology, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems). Nerve conduction studies, electromyogram, and muscle pathology may be of help when there is associated peripheral nervous system involvement. But most importantly, genetic investigations with targeted or rather whole exome or genome sequencing should be performed. A correct diagnosis is important in planning adequate treatment, in genetic counselling and also for future understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and possible new treatments. A multidiciplinary team is needed both in investigation and treatment.",

From review of the clinical and imaging data of eight individuals from five families with biallelic EML1 variants, a very consistent imaging phenotype emerges. The clinical syndrome is characterized by mainly neurological features including severe developmental delay, drug‐resistant seizures and visual impairment. On brain imaging there is megalencephaly with a characteristic ribbon‐like subcortical heterotopia combined with partial or complete callosal agenesis and an overlying polymicrogyria‐like cortical malformation. Several of its features can be recognized on prenatal imaging especially the abnormaly formed lateral ventricles, hydrocephalus (in half of the cases) and suspicion of a neuronal migration disorder. In conclusion, biallelic EML1 disease‐causing variants cause a highly specific pattern of congenital brain malformations, severe developmental delay, seizures and visual impairment.",

This gene encodes an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein that is involved in processing the embryonically critical WNT signaling proteins. Individuals diagnosed with FDH were recruited to participate in the study through the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasia. Individuals were evaluated to characterize the FDH phenotype. Each participant completed a brief dental survey and oral evaluation using artificial light. To identify the oral soft and hard tissue findings 19 individuals (16 female and 3 male) participated with a median age of 10 years (range 2–56 years). Soft and hard tissue defects were present in 68% (13) and 94% (18) of the patients, respectively. Dental anomalies were highly prevalent with 68% (13) demonstrating vertical enamel grooving, 52% (10) having peg shaped tooth deformities, and 78% (15) having enamel hypoplasia with or without discoloration. Cleft lip and cleft palate presented in 15% (3) of the participants. Other findings included 57% (11) having intra‐oral lipoma or papilloma with no site predilection. Dental malocclusions were common with 63% (12) having some degree of malocclusion with 15% (3) of participants having class III malocclusion with an anterior dental cross bite. Participants frequently reported speech problems or difficulty with chewing (73%; N = 14). This study shows there is marked variation in the oral phenotype of individuals with FDH and underscores the important role of WNT signaling in oro‐facial development. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

To date, there have been a limited number of case reports on the ocular manifestations of FDH. This is a prospective, non‐consecutive, observational case series. Prospective ophthalmologic evaluation was performed on 18 patients with confirmed genetic testing for FDH, Goltz Syndrome, as a component of a larger multi‐subspecialty study to better characterize the findings of this condition. Special attention was placed on evaluating the incidence of anophthalmia, microphthalmia, colobomas (iris, optic nerve, and/or retinal), cataracts, nystagmus, and strabismus. A complete ophthalmologic exam was done on all the patients. The mean patient age was 12.8 years (1–55 years). Eighty‐nine percent were female and 77% (14/18) of patients had some form of an ophthalmologic manifestation of the condition. Ophthalmological findings included chorioretinal colobomas (61%), iris colobomas (50%), microphthalmia (44%), anophthalmia (11%), cataracts (11%), and conjunctival and eyelid papillomas (5%). Nystagmus was present in 33% and strabismus in 22% of the patients. Visual acuity ranged from 20/20 to no light perception.

Twenty‐three adults with arthrogryposis multiplex congenital (AMC) followed at a single pediatric orthopedic hospital (average age 23.6 years; range 18–36 years; 9 males, 14 females) completed questionnaires related to demographics, mobility, and activities of daily living. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measure Information System and Satisfaction with Life Scale were utilized to evaluate QOL and life satisfaction. Eighty‐three percent reported general health as good/excellent, 30% lived independently, 69% were ambulatory in the community, and 57% were employed. QOL scores for physical function were lower, but other QOL scores were consistent with the general U.S. population. Average pain intensity was mild at 2.6 out of 10, with pain frequently reported in the legs and feet. Fifty‐six percent were satisfied to extremely satisfied with life. Five individuals who were dissatisfied with life also reported lower physical function, higher anxiety, depression and fatigue, and pain in multiple joints. Although most young adults with AMC presented with mild pain and limitations in physical function; overall, they reported good QOL. Findings from the current study will help clinicians anticipate the needs of individuals with AMC as they transition from pediatric to adult care.",

Here we describe the largest cohort to‐date of HGSNAT ‐associated nonsyndromic RP patients, and describe their retinal phenotype, leukocyte enzymatic activity, and likely pathogenic genotypes. We identified biallelic HGSNAT variants in 17 individuals (15 families) as the likely cause of their RP. None showed any other symptoms of MPSIIIC. All had a mild but significant reduction of HGSNAT enzyme activity in leukocytes. The retinal condition was generally of late‐onset, showing progressive degeneration of a concentric area of paramacular retina, with preservation but reduced electroretinogram responses. Symptoms, electrophysiology, and imaging suggest the rod photoreceptor to be the cell initially compromised. HGSNAT enzymatic testing was useful in resolving diagnostic dilemmas in compatible patients. We identified seven novel sequence variants [p.(Arg239Cys); p.(Ser296Leu); p.(Phe428Cys); p.(Gly248Ala); p.(Gly418Arg), c.1543‐2A&gt;C; c.1708delA], three of which were considered to be retina‐disease‐specific alleles. The most prevalent retina‐disease‐specific allele p.(Ala615Thr) was observed heterozygously or homozygously in 8 and 5 individuals respectively (7 and 4 families). Two siblings in one family, while identical for the HGSNAT locus, but discordant for retinal disease, suggest the influence of trans‐acting genetic or environmental modifying factors.",

In Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, this mutation was found in 46 index cases evaluated for AD‐EOAD. In our genealogical analysis, 301 affected relatives of the mutation carriers were identified, 195 of whom were already deceased at the time of interview. Moreover, 560 descendants had a 50% risk of carrying the mutation, and 348 were potentially at risk. A systematic phenotyping was performed in 39 patients. The mean onset age was 42.5 ± 3.9 years, and no significant difference in onset age was observed between the male and female patients. Furthermore, a substantial clinical heterogeneity and high frequencies of spastic paraparesis, language disorders, and neuropsychiatric symptoms were observed. To our knowledge, the investigated families represent the second biggest population carrying a PSEN1 mutation in Latin America, offering a unique opportunity to study the genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease.

There are no clear guidelines for addressing orthopedic concerns or reporting surgical outcomes in this population. This article reviews the literature, reports on a new study, and offers considerations prior to surgical intervention. The new study seeks to determine the effectiveness of surgical intervention in individuals with EDS. It is a retrospective chart review of 154 individuals clinically diagnosed with EDS who had orthopedic surgery &gt;2 years ago at Hospital for Special Surgery. A total of 120 individuals were included in the study. One hundred eleven females and 9 males underwent a total of 320 orthopedic surgeries, of which 204 surgeries had available post‐operative follow‐up. The average age at surgery was 38.2 years (range: 7.6–83.3). Multiple post‐operative complications (290) were reported in 91% of cases. Common complications were persistent pain/discomfort (45), continued subluxation/dislocation (20), instability (19), pain/discomfort from hardware (17), and infection (16). Our results suggest that surgical outcomes are worse for individuals with EDS compared to the general population, a finding which is similar to other studies. Complications occurred more frequently in the EDS population than the average population, suggesting that surgery should be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians with careful pre‐operative planning and full knowledge of the risks and benefits. Guidelines for the care of this unique population must be established.",

The etiology is multifactorial, depending on environmental and genetic factors. Although monogenic KSD is frequent in children, unbiased prevalence data of heritable forms in adults is scarce. Within 2 years of recruitment, all patients hospitalized for urological kidney stone intervention at our center were consecutively enrolled for targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS). Additionally, clinical and metabolic assessments were performed for genotype–phenotype analyses. The cohort comprised 155 (66%) males and 81 (34%) females, with a mean age at first stone of 47 years (4–86). The diagnostic yield of tNGS was 6.8% (16/236), with cystinuria ( SLC3A1 , SLC7A9 ), distal renal tubular acidosis (SLC4A1 ), and renal phosphate wasting ( SLC34A1 , SLC9A3R1 ) as underlying hereditary disorders. While metabolic syndrome traits were associated with late‐onset KSD, hereditary KSD was associated with increased disease severity in terms of early‐onset, frequent recurrence, mildly impaired kidney function, and common bilateral affection. By employing systematic genetic analysis to a less biased cohort of common adult kidney stone formers, we demonstrate its diagnostic value for establishing the underlying disorder in a distinct proportion. Factors determining pretest probability include age at first stone (&lt;40 years), frequent recurrence, mild CKD, and bilateral KSD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As general population screening becomes more common, an increasing number of cystic fibrosis (CF) carriers will be identified who do not have a family history of CF. Whether these carriers inform their relatives of their carrier status and whether their relatives are motivated to pursue carrier screening is unknown. We surveyed CF carriers with and without a family history of CF to understand whether and how information dissemination patterns differ, why information is or is not shared, and to what extent relatives are known to undergo testing. CF carriers were identified from a general population carrier screening clinic (group B = 18) or were parents of affected children followed at a CF clinic (group A = 30). CF carriers with a family history told essentially 100% of their living parents, siblings, and half‐siblings, while those without a family history told 84% of living parents and 56% of siblings ( P &lt; 0.05). Despite the high rate of information dissemination in both groups, few siblings were known to have undergone carrier screening (14/74). Significantly fewer second‐ and third‐degree relatives were informed about carrier status or were known to have undergone carrier screening. Group A was more likely to inform second‐ and third‐degree relatives about carrier status. Our study documents that the frequency and reasons for disclosing CF carrier status differ between individuals with and without a family history of CF despite the fact that the reproductive risks for their relatives are the same. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The major mutation causing CHH in Finns is a 70A → G nucleotide substitution in the RMRP gene, which encodes the untranslated RNA that is a component of mitochondrial RNA‐processing endoribonuclease. Here we report that the same mutation is the most frequent one, perhaps the only one, in the Amish population in which CHH was first characterized. The fact that the mutation segregates with the same major haplotype in these two populations and others suggests that it is very ancient. Unlike some other ordinarily rare recessive disorders that are limited in their high frequency to a single Amish deme (subisolate), e.g., Ellis‐van Creveld syndrome, CHH occurs in high frequency in at least three distinct Amish demes, indicating, along with genealogic data, that there were multiple heterozygotes among the founders, as proposed by McKusick et al.

    "abstract": "Abstract Genetic diseases are family diseases. Although there is considerable research on how individuals decide to have genetic testing and their individual reactions to testing, there is limited research on the familial context of genetic testing. In the present study, we focus on three aspects of the family context of genetic testing for hemophilia A carrier status among women at risk to be carriers. We look at the extent to which there was discussion of carrier testing for hemophilia before we offered DNA‐based carrier testing to these at‐risk women; with which family members these tested women communicated the results of their carrier testing; and concerns these women had about communicating their carrier test results with relatives, including their children. Data suggest that members of families with hemophilia discussed carrier testing prior to study participation, that the communication of testing information within families was selective, not universal, largely following gender lines for this X‐linked disorder, and that there was limited concern about communicating carrier status information to children and other relatives. These data reinforce observations that families are social systems, and within these systems information is selectively communicated. A more complete understanding of how families communicate genetic test information will enable providers to develop more effective means of assisting individuals in handling the familial communication aspects of genetic testing. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Folic acid is essential for many cellular reactions, including synthesis of nucleotides and regulation of cell cycle. Folic acid‐binding protein one ( Folbp1 ), a membrane‐bounded protein, is the primary mediator of folic acid transport. Mice deficient in Folbp1 gene die in utero with multiple malformations, including severe exencephaly and craniofacial defects. Fusion of the neural tube and craniofacies require precisely regulated interactions of apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. To understand the role of Folbp1 in regulating the fusions of these primordia, levels of dead and proliferating precursor cells from Folbp1 embryos were quantified before the fusion processes. Massive apoptosis was detected in the Folbp1 −/− defective tissues, with Bax and activated caspase‐3 distributed evenly across the apico‐basal axis of the lateral neural plate. 5‐Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and PCNA labeling assays revealed a reduced cell proliferation as well. However, telomerase activity was unaltered, arguing against telomere shortening and consequently, chromosomal instability, as the cause of the apoptosis. Notably, Islet‐1 and 2H3 immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of differentiating neuronal cells, albeit in decreased numbers. Interestingly, Folbp1 −/− embryos also elaborated novel neural structures that sprouted orthogonally from the embryonic neuraxis. Assays on the defective craniofacies exhibited similar phenomena, suggesting the neural crest precursor population that gives rise to both these structures is selectively vulnerable to Folbp1 inactivation. The results demonstrate a prominent role of Folbp1 in the regional regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation that underlies the aberrant neural tube and craniofacial defects. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Many clinical geneticists and genetic counselors have had the challenge of delivering a postnatal diagnosis of Down syndrome to parents of newborns. Down syndrome is a common chromosome condition occurring in approximately 1 in 800 live births. Presenting the diagnosis to families must be accomplished in a supportive, positive, caring, and honest manner. However, there are few scientific data and little instruction in training programs on how best to convey this news in an appropriate manner. Several articles in the literature over the last three decades have proposed various guidelines for the so‐called informing interview. Discussions of parents' preferences and experiences in receiving this news have also been documented. Few reports, however, have focused on breaking difficult news of the diagnosis of a genetic condition to parents in a newborn setting in the genetics literature. In this paper, we will review the medical literature on delivering difficult news, specifically focused on that regarding the diagnosis of Down syndrome in the newborn setting. We propose a theoretical framework from which the informing interview can be planned and future outcome data can be measured. In this way, researchers of this theme can investigate the process, including the healthcare professionals' delivery of difficult news and make recommendations for continued improvement of the process. Our model can be generalized to breaking difficult news for a variety of other congenital conditions. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The complexity of multifactorial conditions like autism raises a host of ethical and counseling challenges.

To better understand the opinions of BRCA mutation carriers regarding the genetic testing of minors and the cognitive and affective processes underlying these opinions, we interviewed BRCA mutation carriers and their adult offspring who had learned of their parent's BRCA mutation. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 53 parents and 22 offspring. In response to a closed‐ended question, 52% (n = 39) of participants were opposed to the testing of minors. Responses to an open‐ended question indicate that many participants (24%, n = 18) feel that testing could be permitted for some minor offspring. Psychological risks and the insufficient maturity of minors were frequent concerns of participants opposed to testing minors. The potential to impact health behaviors was frequently cited as a reason to support the genetic testing of minors. These preliminary results suggest that many BRCA mutation carriers and their adult offspring have concerns about, or are opposed to the genetic testing of minors. However, a significant minority in our study would support testing minors. Greater support for testing among offspring could indicate increasing requests for early genetic diagnosis. Further research is necessary to explore the risks and benefits of providing genetic testing to minors for adult‐onset hereditary cancer syndromes in order to inform clinical practice and public policy and to ensure optimal psychosocial and medical outcomes for all members in families at risk for genetically determined disease. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

One subtelomeric deletion, Wolf‐Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS), causes mild to severe MR, but the cognitive‐behavioral features of individuals with WHS have not been studied systematically. To that end, we administered a comprehensive cognitive‐behavioral battery to 12 children with WHS, ages 4–17 years, who also had some expressive language. Using the Stanford‐Binet (4th Edition), we found cognitive deficits ranged from mild to severe, with mean IQ = 44.1. Interviewing parents with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, we found mean adaptive behavior score (DQ) = 37.3, with females exhibiting slightly higher scores than males. Cognitive profiles indicated relative strengths in Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning. Adaptive behavior profiles noted significant relative strengths in the Socialization Domain. These cognitive‐behavioral profiles differed from children with other subtelomeric deletion syndromes, 2q37 or 8p23. Attention deficits and hyperactivity (ADHD) were observed in 7/12 (58%) of the children we tested. One child attained a score on the Child Autism Rating Scale (CARS) suggestive of mild autism. We conclude that different genetic disorders, which cause MR, produce diverse cognitive‐behavioral profiles. Consequently, cognitive‐behavioral profiles of children with MR need to be assessed more comprehensively. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Few studies have explored how the unique genetic and environmental influences that create twinning affect phenotypes and outcomes. Previous data has shown that twins account for a significant proportion of preterm and low‐birth‐weight infants, who are at risk for long‐term neurodevelopmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment. More recently, it has been postulated that even without these co‐morbidities, twinning in and of itself may incur a neurodevelopmental disadvantage even among term newborns. The purpose of this review is to report primarily on neuromotor outcomes of twins compared to singletons. In addition, we describe specific environmental risk factors among twins which are associated with poorer outcomes. Several putative neurodevelopmental modulators are explored, including death of a co‐twin, chorionicity, birth weight discordance, and twin‐twin transfusion. By teasing out environmental influences that potentially influence neurocognitive outcomes, families can receive more specific counseling and developmental services can be provided to those twins at especially high risk. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

We gathered retrospective psychotropic use information from parents or other caregivers of 62 individuals with SMS who were asked about use of psychotropic medication from a list of commonly used psychiatric medications. For those drugs identified, respondents were asked to rate the experience with the particular medication using a likert‐type scale.

Relative frequencies, means and standard deviations pertaining to age and medication effect were derived for each medication category. Six of the seven medication categories examined showed no meaningful deviations from the “no change” score. The benzodiazepine group showed a mild detrimental effect. There were no gender differences in efficacy. Use of psychotropic medication started early in life (mean age 5 years), particularly with sleep aides.

For example, instead of following 50,000 pregnant women to have sufficient statistical power to identify a doubling in risk of oral clefts associated with a common exposure (e.g., cigarette smoking), 75 cases and 3 controls per case could be studied with equal statistical power. Examples of case sources include hospital or clinical series, or birth defect registries. For validity, control subjects should represent the population base of the cases, which can be difficult to identify for non‐population‐based case groups. Case–control studies typically rely on retrospective exposure measurement, which presents a major challenge and sets up the possibility of recall bias. Approaches are discussed to keep sources of bias to a minimum, including recall, non‐differential information, and selection biases. Case–control studies can play an important role in this process for both hypothesis‐generation and hypothesis‐testing of potential teratogens.

The safety and efficacy data found in the label is derived from well-controlled clinical trials conducted prior to a drug's approval.

Combinations of different sources of data are necessary to acquire the most complete picture of potential teratogenic risk, as no single method can capture all desired data to help pregnant patients and women of child bearing potential make appropriate risk benefits decisions along with their health care providers.",

    "abstract": "Teratology Information Services (TIS) located throughout the world have long played a key role in screening for potential new human teratogens. Using a basic prospective cohort study design, TIS recruit pregnant women from among callers to the Services who have had an exposure of interest and at the same time identify an unexposed comparison group from the same pool of callers. Women in both groups are followed to pregnancy outcome and a range of adverse outcomes including major congenital anomalies, birth size, pregnancy loss, and preterm delivery are evaluated, while controlling for potential confounding. Particularly for rare exposures or newly marketed medications, TIS may be uniquely suited to gathering this information in a timely and efficient fashion. The primary limitation of these studies is the unknown representativeness of the volunteer sample, and the typical small to moderate sample sizes. Methods to increase the proportion of exposed pregnancies that are recruited should be developed. However, small sample size TIS studies, especially when considering new or rare exposures, often fulfill the important function of providing some reassurance to women who have already had the exposure of interest by ruling out major risks for teratogenicity, that is, on the order of thalidomide. Collaborations across TIS nationally and internationally help to address the sample size challenges. A formal collaboration between the TIS cohort study model with a case-control study design is also underway and will provide complementary strengths.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Syndrome‐specific behavior was proposed by Langdon Down in his first clinical descriptions. Research interest followed but waned during the eugenics era when antisocial behavior was attributed to people with intellectual disability (ID) and the US Supreme Court legalized involuntary sterilization. When these claims were refuted and behavioral treatments introduced, their focus on environmental determination minimized the importance of biological research. The modern era began with the recognition that patterned behavior, for example, self‐injury in Lesch–Nyhan syndrome and hyperphagia in PWS, was syndrome‐specific, and when parent support groups pointed out syndrome‐specific behavioral similarities in their children. Syndrome‐specific rating scales and methodologies followed to allow behavioral comparisons between syndromes. The focus initially was on specific behaviors but with refinements in neuropsychological tests has expanded to include neurocognitive profiles. Greater clarification in genetic diagnoses has led to mutant mouse behavioral models and neurophysiologic and neuroimaging strategies have made possible the study of brain circuits. There is growing interest in investigating the developmental trajectory of behaviors from infancy to adulthood and old age. Because anxiety, mood disturbance, repetitive behaviors, and social deficits commonly occur in people with severe ID, those affected are often given multiple psychiatric diagnoses. This has led to considerable confusion in the literature. It is critical to focus on specific behaviors and cognitive patterns in research and not confuse psychiatric symptoms that lack precise definitions and involve multiple genes, the so‐called psychiatric phenotype, with the more specific behavioral phenotype. New treatments based on knowledge of underlying neurobiology call for more fine‐grained definition of behavior. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency in the enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA). Pompe disease is characterized by the accumulation of glycogen, predominantly in muscle tissue, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of motor, respiratory, and, in the infantile-onset form, cardiac function. Disease progression is highly variable depending on phenotype, but premature death due to respiratory complications occurs in most patients. Beginning in 2006, approved alglucosidase alfa enzyme replacement therapies [recombinant human (rh) GAA] have been available to treat Pompe patients. Treatment of classic infantile-onset patients, who manifest the severest form of the disease, with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®) has led to extended survival and an evolving understanding of the pathophysiology and course of the disease. Moreover, such treatment has brought to light the role of the immune response in abrogating the efficacy of rhGAA in classic infantile-onset patients with severe genetic mutations. Thus, optimization of treatment for such patients includes development and utilization of strategies to prevent or eliminate immune responses, including modulating the immune system (prophylactic and therapeutic immune tolerance induction regimens) and engineering the enzyme to be less immunogenic and more effective. Future research is also critical for evaluating and mitigating novel disease-associated pathologies uncovered by prolonged survival of infantile-onset patients including development of novel therapeutics, and for protein design strategies to increase delivery of enzyme replacement therapy to critical target tissues. Such efforts would be greatly bolstered by further development of predictive animal models and biomarkers to facilitate clinical trials and patient management. Published 2012.

We previously identified cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and abnormal cerebellar foliation in individuals with CHARGE syndrome. Here, we report mild cerebellar hypoplasia and distinct cerebellar foliation anomalies in a Chd7 haploinsufficient mouse model. We describe specific alterations in the precise spatio‐temporal sequence of fissure formation during perinatal cerebellar development responsible for these foliation anomalies. The altered cerebellar foliation pattern in Chd7 haploinsufficient mice show some similarities to those reported in mice with altered Engrailed, Fgf8 or Zic1 gene expression and we propose that mutations or polymorphisms in these genes may modify the cerebellar phenotype in CHARGE syndrome. Our findings in a mouse model of CHARGE syndrome indicate that a careful analysis of cerebellar foliation may be warranted in patients with CHARGE syndrome, particularly in patients with cerebellar hypoplasia and developmental delay.",

    "abstract": "Physiotherapy plays a fundamental role in managing adults with the joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers–Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (JHS/EDS‐HT). However, it is a challenge for both the patient and the physiotherapist as the condition is poorly understood and treatment for JHS/EDS‐HT is currently undefined. Insight into current practice is, therefore, necessary in order to establish baseline knowledge in this area and in the long term to improve the standard of patient care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate current physiotherapists' knowledge of JHS/EDS‐HT and to gain insight into current physiotherapy practice with emphasis on assessment, management, and treatment efficacy. Three hundred twenty‐five Flemish physiotherapists participated in the study by filling out electronically a modified version of the “Hypermobility and Hypermobility Syndrome Questionnaire” (HHQ), which covered theoretical constructs such as general knowledge, assessment, management, and learning in relation to generalized joint hypermobility and JHS/EDS‐HT. The results show that physiotherapists report a low level of confidence with regard to assessment and management of JHS/EDS‐HT. Knowledge of hypermobility and JHS/EDS‐HT is weak, especially regarding the features associated with JHS/EDS‐HT. Many treatment approaches are used by physiotherapists with the majority showing preference for education, reassurance, muscle strengthening, proprioceptive and core stability training. Almost all approaches were perceived as being clinically effective by the physiotherapists, highlighting a lack of consensus. In conclusion, this study in Flemish physiotherapists confirms that JHS/EDS‐HT is under‐recognized, not well known and deemed difficult to treat. Further education is required and sought by the physiotherapists surveyed, and future research is needed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Specifically, we describe the cognitive and adaptive functioning of seven children with classic infantile Pompe disease and two children with atypical infantile Pompe disease who have received enzyme replacement therapy (Myozyme®) for an average of 6 years, 8 months and 4 years, 1. 5 months, respectively. Multiple assessments of cognitive functioning were completed over time by means of individualized intelligence (IQ) testing. Adaptive functioning was measured by means of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales‐Second Edition (VABS‐II). Consistent with our earlier findings regarding infants treated with ERT, children with classic infantile Pompe disease (ages 4 years, 11 months to 8 years, 11 months) were functioning at the lower end of the average range in comparison to their typical peers on their most recent IQ test. There was no evidence of a decline in their cognitive abilities over time. In contrast, the two children with atypical infantile Pompe disease (ages 5 years, 4 months and 5 years, 11 months) obtained above average IQ scores and demonstrated significant gains in IQ over time. For all children where adaptive functioning was assessed, their overall level of adaptive functioning on the VABS‐II was lower than their Full Scale IQ scores on cognitive testing. Motor function appears to be an important factor impacting on reduced adaptive behavior. The implication of these findings on our understanding of a possible relationship between CNS status in children with Pompe and their adaptive and cognitive function is discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Many psychiatric disorders are caused by multiple genes and multiple environmental factors, making the identification of specific genetic risk factors for these disorders difficult. Endophenotypes are behaviors or characteristics that are intermediate between the genotype and a phenotype of interest. Because they are more directly related to the gene action than is the endpoint disorder, they may be useful in the identification of specific genes related to psychiatric disorders and the classification of disorders or traits that share an underlying genetic etiology. We discuss genetic and endophenotype research on schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in this review. Some of the psychophysiological endophenotypes that have been studied for schizophrenia include prepulse inhibition of the startle response, the antisaccadic task assessing frontal lobe function, inhibition of the P50 event‐related potential (ERP), and other auditory ERP measures. Potential ASD endophenotypes include theory of mind, language skills (specifically, age at first spoken word and first spoken phrase), social skills, and certain brain functions, such as asynchronization of neural activity and brain responses to emotional faces. Because the link between genes and specific psychiatric disorders is difficult to determine, identification of endophenotypes is useful for beginning the search to identify specific genes that affect these disorders.",

Sleep disturbances have been frequently reported in CdLS, but these have not been completely characterized, and prevalence data are conflicting. The aim of this paper is to characterize and determine the prevalence of sleep disorders in CdLS patients by means of a validated questionnaire. From November 2012 to November 2013, we asked 46 consecutive parents/caregivers of CdLS patients aged more than 3 years old to fill out the sleep disturbances scale for children (SDSC). The subjects were also characterized by the presence of epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID), behavioral problems, CdLS severity score, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and genetic test results. An abnormal total sleep score was found in 7 patients (15.2%), 26 (56.5%) showed a borderline total score, and 18 (39.1%) had an abnormal score for at least one SDSC factor. In our study sleep disorders were found to be positively associated to presence of epilepsy, GERD, ID, and behavioral disturbances. No correlation was evident with specific mutations of the different genes, BMI, and severity score. Our results confirm that sleep disorders represent a common problem in CdLS, with higher incidence than in the normal population. In these patients sleep disorders seem to be more prevalent in comorbid settings, representing a clinical indicator for different medical and neuropsychiatric disorders. Better knowledge and characterization of typology of sleep disorders in CdLS patients could permit a more specific therapeutic approach. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous multisystem developmental disorder with a high degree of variability in its clinical presentation. Approximately 65% of probands harbor mutations in genes that encode core components (SMC1A, SMC3, and RAD21) or regulators (NIPBL, HDAC8) of the cohesin complex, of which mutations in NIPBL are the most common. Cohesin plays a canonical role in sister chromatid cohesion during cell division and non-canonical roles in DNA repair, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, and regulation of gene expression. Disruption of the latter role seems to be the major contributor to the underlying molecular pathogenesis of CdLS. NIPBL is required for loading and unloading the cohesin complex onto chromosomes. The expression levels of NIPBL itself appear to be tightly regulated and highly evolutionarily conserved. Droplet digital PCR was used to quantify NIPBL mRNA expression levels with high precision from a cohort of 37 samples (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, and HDAC8 mutation positive probands and negative control). Probands with severe forms of CdLS or severe mutation types were found to have lower levels of NIPBL in comparison to phenotypically milder patients and controls. Levels of NIPBL also correlated with the presence of mutations in different CdLS-causing genes. The data suggests that NIPBL levels are closely correlated with the severity of CdLS and with specific causative genes and types of mutations. ddPCR may provide a tool to assist in diagnostic approaches to CdLS, for genetic counseling and prognosis, and for monitoring potential therapeutic modalities in the future. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Emerging therapies targeting patients with specific mutations are now becoming a reality for many of these patients. Precise molecular diagnosis is essential to facilitate the identification of possible new treatments for patients in the local context. In this study, we screened 145 dystrophinopathic patients in Singapore and assessed their molecular status for eligibility to current emerging genetic therapies. Overall, 140 (96.5%) of all patients harbored pathogenic DMD mutations comprising 95 exonic deletions (65.5%), 14 exonic duplications (9.7%), and 31 pathogenic small mutations (21.4%). Nonsense and frameshift mutations constitute 83.9% of all the small mutations. We found 71% (103/145) of all Singaporean dystrophinopathy patients to be theoretically amenable for exon skipping, either through skipping of single (53.1%) or multiple exons (17.9%). This approach is applicable to 81.1% (77/95) of patients carrying deletions and 83.9% (26/31) of those with small mutations. Eteplirsen induced skipping of exon 51 is applicable to 12.4% of local patients. Nonsense read‐through therapy was found to be applicable in another 12.4% of all patients. Mutation screening is crucial for providing insights into the underlying genetic signature of the disease in the local population and contributes toward existing information on DMD mutations in Asia and globally. This will guide future targeted drug development and clinical trial planning for this disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Clinical interventions and research have mostly focused on the orthopedic and genetic outcomes of individuals with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), and although pain has gained recognition as an important issue experienced by individuals with AMC, it has received little attention within the AMC literature. The aims of this scoping review were to describe the pain experiences of children and adults with AMC, to identify pain assessment tools and management techniques, and document the impact of pain on participation in everyday activities among children and adults with AMC. A search of the literature was conducted in four search engines and identified a total of 89 articles. Once study eligibility was reviewed, 21 studies met the selection criteria and were included in this review. Pain appears to be more commonly experienced in adults with AMC compared with children with AMC, with individuals having undergone multiple corrective procedures self‐reporting pain more often. In adult populations, musculoskeletal chronic pain is a significant problem, resulting in restrictions in activities of daily living, mobility, and participation. Researchers and clinicians must agree on the use of validated measures appropriate for evaluating pain in AMC and the use of appropriate pain management techniques to relieve pain. Pediatric studies should focus on determining how commonly pain is experienced in infants, children, and adolescents with AMC. Pain in adults with AMC should be acknowledged to offer proper client‐centered interventions throughout the lifespan.",

Nevertheless, these conditions are highly variable and more symptomatic phenotypes may require significant clinical involvement, including specialty care. While historically most individuals with mild phenotypes remained undiagnosed during their lifetime, the increasing use of genetic testing in clinical care has increased the prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of SCAs. These genetic tests are frequently ordered by nongenetic providers who are also responsible for delivering the diagnosis. We surveyed parents of children ( n = 308) to evaluate their experience of receiving a diagnosis and their support needs. The majority (73.3%) received the diagnosis from a nongenetic medical provider. Following a prenatal diagnosis parents reported experiencing depression, anxiety, and less optimism than those receiving a postnatal diagnosis. Few parents reported receiving materials explaining their child's condition that they found to be up‐to‐date, accurate, and unbiased. The frequently negative reported experiences of parents at time of diagnosis suggests more educational opportunities should be provided for nongenetic providers in order to become more informed about these conditions and communicate the diagnosis in a way parents experience as supportive.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glaucoma is an important cause of irreversible blindness, characterized by optic nerve anomalies. Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and aging are major risk factors. Retinal ganglion cells and trabecular meshwork cells are certainly involved in the etiology of glaucoma. Glaucoma is usually a complex disease, and various genes and functions may contribute to its etiology. Among these may be genes that encode regulatory molecules. In this review, regulatory molecules including 18 transcription factors (TFs), 195 microRNAs (miRNAs), 106 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and two circular RNAs (circRNAs) that are reasonable candidates for having roles in glaucoma pathogenesis are described. The targets of the regulators are reported. Glaucoma‐related features including apoptosis, stress responses, immune functions, ECM properties, IOP, and eye development are affected by the targeted genes. The targeted genes that are frequently targeted by multiple regulators most often affect apoptosis and the related features of cell death and cell survival. BCL2 , CDKN1A , and TP53 are among the frequent targets of three types of glaucoma‐relevant regulators, TFs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. TP53 was itself identified as a glaucoma‐relevant TF. Several of the glaucoma‐relevant TFs are themselves among frequent targets of regulatory molecules, which is consistent with existence of a complex network involved in glaucoma pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Neurobehavioral and developmental issues with a broad range of deficits are prominent features of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a disorder due to disruption of the cohesin protein complex. The etiologic relationship of these clinical findings to anatomic abnormalities on neuro‐imaging studies has not, however, been established. Anatomic abnormalities in the brain and central nervous system specific to CdLS have been observed, including changes in the white matter, brainstem, and cerebellum. We hypothesize that location and severity of brain abnormalities correlate with clinical phenotype in CdLS, as seen in other developmental disorders. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated brain MRI studies of 15 individuals with CdLS and compared these findings to behavior at the time of the scan. Behavior was assessed using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), a validated behavioral assessment tool with several clinical features. Ten of fifteen (67%) of CdLS patients had abnormal findings on brain MRI, including cerebral atrophy, white matter changes, cerebellar hypoplasia, and enlarged ventricles. Other findings included pituitary tumors or cysts, Chiari I malformation and gliosis. Abnormal behavioral scores in more than one behavioral area were seen in all but one patient. All 5 of the 15 (33%) patients with normal structural MRI studies had abnormal ABC scores. All normal ABC scores were noted in only one patient and this was correlated with moderately abnormal MRI changes. Although our cohort is small, our results suggest that abnormal behaviors can exist in individuals with CdLS in the setting of relatively normal structural brain findings. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

However, our understanding of the global impact of the additional X chromosome on the genome remains an enigma. Evidence from the existing literature of KS indicates that not just one single genetic mechanism can explain the phenotype and the variable expressivity, but several mechanisms may be at play concurrently. In this review, we describe different genetic mechanisms and recent advances in the understanding of the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome of KS and the link to the phenotype and clinical heterogeneity. Future studies are needed to unite clinical data, genomic data, and basic research attempting to understand the genetics behind KS. Unraveling the genetics of KS will be of clinical relevance as it may enable the use of polygenic risk scores to predict future disease susceptibility and enable clinical risk stratification of KS patients in the future.",

Up to 50% of men with KS have metabolic syndrome, a cluster of features conferring increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These cardiometabolic (CM) risk features have not been studied in adolescents with KS. The objective of this cohort study was to compare CM risk features in adolescents with KS to controls matched for sex, age, and BMI z score. Fifty males with KS (age 10–17 years) were well‐matched to male controls ( n = 50) for age (14.0 ± 1.7 vs. 14.0 ± 1.5 years) and BMI z score (0.3 ± 1.3 vs. 0.4 ± 1.2). Three CM risk features were present in 30% of adolescents with KS compared to 12% of controls (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.9, p = .048). The KS group had significantly lower HDL cholesterol ( p = .006), higher triglycerides ( p &lt; .001), and greater waist circumference percentile ( p &lt; .001). Despite a normal BMI, the prevalence of CM risk features was very high in adolescents with KS, particularly for central adiposity and dyslipidemia. The pathophysiology of this metabolic profile independent of obesity needs further investigation to facilitate prevention of the high morbidity of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in this population.

Despite its recognized burden on public health, the etiology in the vast majority of individuals remains unknown. Chromosomal abnormality plays an important role, frequently observed as large cytogenetically visible rearrangement or small submicroscopic structural variation in the genome. Several genomic disorders are now recognized that are increasingly responsible for CHD with variable penetrance. Single gene disorders, epigenetic alterations, and environmental etiologies are also significant contributors. Our understanding of the genetic basis of CHD has increased exponentially with the escalating use of next generation sequencing to identify ever so small submicroscopic genomic imbalances at the level of coding exons in CHD. This review focuses on genomic disorders other than 22q11.2 deletion, that are major players in the etiology of human cardiac malformations.",

We present the first fetal case of left ventricular non‐compaction (LVNC) with a PRDM16 variant. The third‐trimester obstetric ultrasound revealed a hydropic fetus with hydramnios and expanded hypokinetic heart. After termination of pregnancy, foetopathology showed a eutrophic fetus with isolated cardiomegaly. Endocardial fibroelastosis was associated with non‐compaction of the myocardium of the left ventricle.

This study utilized integrative review and PRISMA-guided methodology to search six databases for information pertaining to 48,XXYY.

Among 397 articles reviewed for potential inclusion, 30 articles remained after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Seven of these articles concentrated solely on participants with 48,XXYY. Literature was summarized into categories of physical phenotype, psychosocial, behavioral, neurocognitive, and brain function. Clinical description of 48,XXYY has evolved over time to develop a deeper understanding of this complex disorder. Large gaps remain, especially a lack of experimental studies, clinical guidelines, and treatments. Additionally, few studies explore methodologies such as interviews or self-report surveys in this population. 48,XXYY presents with a wide spectrum of physical, psychological, and neurocognitive symptoms, and frequently requires complex interdisciplinary care. In order to better understand this disorder and to appropriately treat the individuals affected by it, future research should focus on experimental studies and research that utilizes a variety of methods, including participant interviews and patient-report surveys.",

The adoption of social distancing interfered with the flow of existing policies, and may thus negatively affect the most vulnerable groups, such as the rare disease community. Aimming at characterizing the perception of the impact of COVID‐19 on the health care of the Brazilian rare disease community, an online questionnaire addressed to patients with rare diseases and their caregivers was disseminated in the Brazilian territory between June 1st to July 5th, 2020. The questions dealt with the sanitary measures adopted; access to medical services; and mental suffering during the pandemic. The survey was answered by 1,466 participants (&lt;18 yo = 53.3%) representing 192 rare diseases. Regarding physical distancing, 1,372 (93.6%) participants did not leave their residence, or did so only when essential; 1,321 (90.1%) always wore masks when leaving home. 1,042 (71.1%) and 995 (67.9%) participants, respectively, referred medical genetics appointments and rehabilitation therapies were postponed/canceled. Telemedicine was experienced by 1,026 (70%), and 68.3% agreed this is a good strategy for health care. Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM, n = 624, 42.5%) appear to have more access to information and ability to overcome difficulties, and feel less threatened, lonely and depressed than the non‐IEM group ( p &lt; .05). There was an increment of the rare disease patients' vulnerability in the pandemic scenario. The cooperation of patients/caregivers along with adaptation of the health system is crucial and may be so even post‐pandemic.",

Despite the congenital nature of the disease, CAKUT accounts for almost 10% of adult onset ESKD. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that CAKUT is a Mendelian disorder, including the observation of familial clustering of CAKUT. Pathogenesis in CAKUT is embryonic in origin, with disturbances of kidney and urinary tract development resulting in a heterogeneous range of disease phenotypes. Despite polygenic and environmental factors being implicated, a significant proportion of CAKUT is monogenic in origin, with studies demonstrating single gene defects in 10%–20% of patients with CAKUT.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rare genetic disorders affect as many as 3%–5% of all babies born. Approximately 10,000 such disorders have been identified or hypothesized to exist. Treatment is supportive except in a limited number of instances where specific therapies exist. Development of new therapies has been hampered by at least two major factors: difficulty in diagnosing diseases early enough to enable treatment before irreversible damage occurs, and the high cost of developing new drugs and getting them approved by regulatory agencies. Whole‐genome sequencing (WGS) techniques have become exponentially less expensive and more rapid since the beginning of the human genome project, such that return of clinical data can now be achieved in days rather than years and at a cost that is comparable to other less expansive genetic testing. Thus, it is likely that WGS will ultimately become a mainstream, first‐tier NBS technique at least for those disorders without appropriate high‐throughput functional tests. However, there are likely to be several steps in the evolution to this end. The clinical implications of these advances are profound but highlight the bottlenecks in drug development that still limit transition to treatments. This article summarizes discussions arising from a recent National Institute of Health conference on nucleic acid therapy, with a focus on the impact of WGS in the identification of diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic disorders.",

Early results do not show large‐scale psychological distress among those tested; therefore, research is now focusing on identifying subgroups that may be at risk for negative outcomes. Social support has been shown to buffer both negative physical and psychological outcomes in health research. The role of spouses as part of the tested person's social support system is shown to be significant in a sample of 57 BRCA1 mutation carriers. Separately, the tested person's perception of his/her spouse's anxiety and his/her perception of the spouse's support at the time of testing are predictive of the tested person's psychological distress up to 2 years after testing. The interaction of the two variables is even more predictive. For those tested who perceived their spouse to be both anxious and nonsupportive at the time of testing, distress levels reached clinically significant levels 1 week after results were received and remained above clinical threshold measured 4 months, 1 year, and 2 years after testing. While the effects were greatest for women, they were significant for both male and female carriers. These findings are an important addition to the literature and will augment clinicians' ability to identify individuals potentially at risk for negative responses to adverse genetic test results. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There are several hereditary conditions associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). These include well‐characterized autosomal dominant syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). A novel autosomal recessive form of FAP, caused by mutations in the base excision repair gene MYH , has recently been recognized. This discovery has provided further evidence for the importance of DNA repair mechanisms in CRC development, already documented by the involvement of the mismatch repair in HNPCC. Additional CRC‐predisposing conditions, such as hyperplastic polyposis and hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome, are being outlined. Heterogeneity of genetic mechanisms has important consequences for counseling and surveillance in hereditary CRC. Nevertheless, classical mendelian conditions represent only a minor share of the total CRC population burden. Alleles of the same genes that are involved in hereditary syndromes might also act as low penetrance variants, as shown for APC 1307K in the Ashkenazi. However, the level of complexity of multifactorial CRC is such that current tools appear inadequate to pinpoint all the involved components. A combination of different strategies, including careful clinical observation, analysis of homogeneous patient populations, and critical evaluation of data derived from experimental models, along with methodological improvements in nucleic acid analysis, will probably be necessary to unravel the basis of nonmendelian CRC. Once this is achieved, it will be possible to realize the ultimate goal of targeted CRC prevention, with the adoption of measures tailored according to individual risk levels. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A multistate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study was designed to investigate the etiology of congenital hearing loss in infants ascertained through state‐mandated hearing screening or early hearing loss detection and intervention (EHDI) programs. At least 50% of permanent childhood‐onset hearing loss is due to genetic causes, and approximately 20% of all infants with congenital hearing loss have mutations in the GJB2 gene. Another 1% of childhood hearing loss is due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations. The specific aims of this study are to 1) classify the etiology of congenital hearing loss in infants by doing prospective genetic evaluations of all newborns with permanent hearing loss from defined geographic areas, 2) determine the frequency of mutations in GJB2 and two common mitochondrial mutations in these populations, and 3) establish a model infrastructure linking genetic services to statewide EHDI programs. As of April 2003, Utah is the only center evaluating patients. Study subjects identified through the Utah Department of Health EHDI program are contacted by letter and offered a comprehensive medical genetics evaluation with DNA testing for GJB2 and mitochondrial mutations A1555G and A7445G. To date, 25 probands and their immediate family members have been evaluated. We have identified 20 cases with nonsyndromic hearing loss (7 multiplex and 13 simplex), 4 with syndromic hearing loss, and 1 with presumed cytomegalovirus (CMV)‐induced hearing loss. Six of 19 (32%) nonsyndromic cases with sensorineural hearing loss have mutations of one or both alleles of the GJB2 gene, and 21% are homozygous or compound heterozygotes for the 35delG mutation. No A1555G or A7445G mtDNA mutations have been found. Data reported to date include only children born in Utah, but EHDI programs in Hawaii, Rhode Island, and designated areas of Georgia have begun enrolling children in what is now a multistate collaborative study. This is the first comprehensive investigation to determine the etiology of hearing loss from populations ascertained through EHDI programs. The results of this study will facilitate the incorporation of genetic services into EHDI programs. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Birth defects remain the leading cause of infant death in US. The field of teratology has been focused on the causes and underlying mechanisms of birth defects for decades, yet our understanding of these critical issues remain unacceptably vague. Conclusions from years of animal and human studies made it clear that the vast majority of birth defects have multifactorial origins, with contributions from environmental and genetic factors. The environment comprises not only of the physical, biological, and chemical external environment surrounding the pregnant woman, but it also includes the internal environment of the woman's body that interact with the developing embryo in a complex fashion. The importance of maternal and embryonic genetic factors consisting of countless genetic variants/mutations that exist within every individual contribute to birth defect susceptibility is only now being more fully appreciated. This great complexity of the genome and its diversity within individuals and populations seems to be the principal reason why the same teratogenic exposure can induce severe malformation in one embryo, while fail to do so to other exposed embryos. As the interaction between genetic and environmental factors has long been recognized as the first “Principle of Teratology” by Wilson and Warkany [1965. Teratology: Principles and techniques. Chicago: University of Chicago Press], it is only recently that the appropriate investigative tools have been developed with which to fully investigate this fundamental principle. The introduction of high throughput technologies like whole genome sequencing or genome‐wide association studies are promising to deliver an enormous amount of new data that will shed light on the genomic factors that contribute susceptibility to environmental teratogens. In this review, we attempt to summarize the epidemiological and experimental literature concerning birth defects whose phenotypic expression can be clearly related to the interactions between several select environmental factors and those genetic pathways in which they are most likely to have significant modifying effects. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Eight VRDs: acardia (AC), amelia (AM), bladder exstrophy (BE), cloaca exstrophy (CE), conjoined twins (CT), cyclopia (CY), “true” phocomelia (PH), and sirenomelia (SI) were selected, all of whom showed prevalences in the order of 1/100,000 births, except for BE: 1/48,000 births. Materials in this investigation from 25 million pregnancy outcomes, were provided by 22 Clearinghouse‐member programs. The study protocol provided a working definition, a summary of the phenotypic characteristic, and a list of ICD‐9 and ICD‐10 codes for each VRDs. Learned lessons include: (1) The suspected associations of decreasing risk with advancing maternal age in AM and SI, and increasing risk in BE, and increasing frequency of twins in SI, were confirmed. (2) Morphologically similar defects showed dissimilar epidemiological characteristics, namely, AM and PH, and BE and CE. (3) Heterogeneity in total prevalences for most VRDs among different surveillance programs were attributed to operational reasons, except for SI and CT in which Amerindian ethnicity seems to be associated with higher prevalence. (4) Verbatim description is essential and must be stored in electronic files. In addition to codes. (5) Dysmorphologists or clinical geneticists are an essential part of the coordinating team of the surveillance program. (6) ICD coding system is insufficient.

    "abstract": "Abstract Noncompaction refers to an uncommon structural abnormality of the heart's ventricular myocardium characterized by an abnormally thick layer of left ventricular trabeculations, as well as hypoplastic papillary muscles. The condition is associated with a variable clinical phenotype including heart failure, thromboembolism, and sudden death. In this retrospective study of fetal and neonatal autopsy hearts with noncompaction, clinical profiles were correlated with gross and histologic findings and compared with a set of age‐matched controls. Pathologic criteria for noncompaction included hypoplastic left ventricular papillary muscles, abnormal trabecular architecture and greater than 50% penetration of the left ventricular wall thickness by intertrabecular recesses. Among eight fetuses and full‐term neonates with pathologic features of noncompaction, all had evidence of severe heart failure, including four with complete heart block and two others with bradycardia. None experienced sudden death. Seven of eight hearts had associated heart malformations—four with left atrial isomerism, two with aortic and/or pulmonary valve dysplasia consistent with stenosis and, one with atrial septal defect. One heart with noncompaction had no associated malformations. With characteristic excessive trabeculation in the left ventricle, noncompaction also included biventricular endocardial fibroelastosis that denoted right ventricular involvement in all hearts. Thus, (1) among autopsied fetuses and neonates with noncompaction, heart failure including heart block is a common cause of death, (2) noncompaction is often associated with various cardiovascular malformations, but even in isolation it can be the basis for severe cardiac failure, and (3) biventricular endocardial fibroelastosis in noncompaction suggests a global pathologic process. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Although challenges remain, particularly in identification of the best strategy for follow‐up and management of later onset Pompe disease, these challenges can surely be overcome as they have been with other disorders added to the newborn screening panel.

    "abstract": "Abstract Head morphogenesis is a complex process that is controlled by multiple signaling centers. The most common defects of cranial development are craniofacial defects, such as cleft lip and cleft palate, and neural tube defects, such as anencephaly and encephalocoele in humans. More than 400 genes that contribute to proper neural tube closure have been identified in experimental animals, but only very few causative gene mutations have been identified in humans, supporting the notion that environmental influences are critical. The intrauterine environment is influenced by maternal nutrition, and hence, maternal diet can modulate the risk for cranial and neural tube defects. This article reviews recent progress toward a better understanding of nutrients during pregnancy, with particular focus on mouse models for defective neural tube closure. At least four major patterns of nutrient responses are apparent, suggesting that multiple pathways are involved in the response, and likely in the underlying pathogenesis of the defects. Folic acid has been the most widely studied nutrient, and the diverse responses of the mouse models to folic acid supplementation indicate that folic acid is not universally beneficial, but that the effect is dependent on genetic configuration. If this is the case for other nutrients as well, efforts to prevent neural tube defects with nutritional supplementation may need to become more specifically targeted than previously appreciated. Mouse models are indispensable for a better understanding of nutrient–gene interactions in normal pregnancies, as well as in those affected by metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Behavioral phenotype of XXY includes social anxiety, ADHD, social communication, and atypical peer interactions. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS) were completed by the parents of 54 boys with XXY who had not received hormonal replacement prior to participation. Our findings suggest fewer behavioral deficits and lower severity in the general 47,XXY population than previously published and found significant differences between the groups with a positive FLD on the behavioral assessments. Findings demonstrate that boys with FLD exhibit an increased incidence and severity of behavioral problems. Our study expands on the findings of Samango‐Sprouse et al. [Samango‐Sprouse et al. ( 2012b ) J Intellect Disabil Res] and the significant influence that FLD has on not only neurodevelopment, but also behavioral deficits. Our study suggests that part of the XXY phenotypic profile may be modulated by FLD. Further study is underway to examine the interaction between the many salient factors effecting behavioral and neurodevelopmental progression in XXY and variant forms. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite scientific advances in clinical teratology, exposures during pregnancy still cause great anxiety and misunderstanding. Patients and health care providers are frequently called upon to determine the health implications of scientific studies, which may involve limited and contradictory data. These findings are often conveyed numerically, which is a particularly difficult form of information for both patients and their health providers to understand and interpret. Almost half of the general population (and a substantial minority of physicians) have difficulty with numeracy. Patients with low numeracy tend to interpret information in an absolute manner and ignore uncertainty, have more difficulty using numeric information to inform their choices, and are more easily influenced by emotion and the format used in presenting information. Formats involved in conveying probability include positive or negative framing, use of relative versus absolute risk, and ratios and percentages. Health providers should communicate risk analysis in a fashion that facilitates comprehension and results in informed behavior. This is more likely to be achieved when risks are conceptualized as more than just numbers, and are considered in the context of individuals' life circumstances and values. Most teratogen risk communication is done over the telephone; this presents both advantages and challenges. Strategies are suggested to improve risk communication. These include avoiding the use of relative risk, using a consistent denominator, framing the information in a variety of ways (positive vs. negative), using verbal qualifiers judiciously, and employing visual aids. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a recognized childhood disorder mostly characterized by motor coordination difficulties. Joint hypermobility syndrome, alternatively termed Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type (JHS/EDS‐HT), is a hereditary connective tissue disorder mainly featuring generalized joint hypermobility (gJHM), musculoskeletal pain, and minor skin features. Although these two conditions seem apparently unrelated, recent evidence highlights a high rate of motor and coordination findings in children with gJHM or JHS/EDS‐HT. Here, we investigated the prevalence of gJHM in 41 Italian children with DCD in order to check for the existence of recognizable phenotypic subgroups of DCD in relation to the presence/absence of gJHM. All patients were screened for Beighton score and a set of neuropsychological tests for motor competences (Movement Assessment Battery for Children and Visual‐Motor Integration tests), and language and learning difficulties (Linguistic Comprehension Test, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Boston Naming Test, Bus Story Test, and Memoria‐Training tests). All patients were also screening for selected JHS/EDS‐HT‐associated features and swallowing problems. Nineteen (46%) children showed gJHM and 22 (54%) did not. Children with DCD and gJHM showed a significant excess of frequent falls (95 vs. 18%), easy bruising (74 vs. 0%), motor impersistence (89 vs. 23%), sore hands for writing (53 vs. 9%), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (89 vs. 36%), constipation (53 vs. 0%), arthralgias/myalgias (58 vs. 4%), narrative difficulties (74 vs. 32%), and atypical swallowing (74 vs. 18%). This study confirms the non‐causal association between DCD and gJHM, which, in turn, seems to increase the risk for non‐random additional features. The excess of language, learning, and swallowing difficulties in patients with DCD and gJHM suggests a wider effect of lax tissues in the development of the nervous system. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Here we review the clinical and molecular aspects of CHD7 that are related to the cardiovascular manifestations of the syndrome. The types of heart defects found in patients with CHD7 mutations are variable, with an overrepresentation of atrioventricular septal defect and outflow tract defect including aortic arch anomalies compared to nonsyndromic heart defects. Chd7 haploinsufficiency in mouse is a good model for studying the heart effects seen in CHARGE syndrome, and mouse models reveal a role for Chd7 in multiple lineages during heart development. Formation of the great vessels requires Chd7 expression in the pharyngeal surface ectoderm, and this expression likely has an non‐autonomous effect on neural crest cells. In the cardiogenic mesoderm, Chd7 is required for atrioventricular cushion development and septation of the outflow tract. Emerging knowledge about the function of CHD7 in the heart indicates that it may act in concert with transcription factors such as TBX1 and SMADs to regulate genes such as p53 and the cardiac transcription factor NKX2.5 .",

The OCDM is a project of the NIDCR‐sponsored FaceBase Consortium, whose goal is to promote and enable research into the genetic and epigenetic causes of specific craniofacial abnormalities through the provision of publicly accessible, integrated craniofacial data. However, the OCDM should be usable for integrating any web‐accessible craniofacial data, not just those data available through FaceBase. The OCDM is based on the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), our comprehensive ontology of canonical human adult anatomy, and includes modules to represent adult and developmental craniofacial anatomy in both human and mouse, mappings between homologous structures in human and mouse, and associated malformations. We describe these modules, as well as prototype uses of the OCDM for integrating craniofacial data. By using the terms from the OCDM to annotate data, and by combining queries over the ontology with those over annotated data, it becomes possible to create “intelligent” queries that can, for example, find gene expression data obtained from mouse structures that are precursors to homologous human structures involved in malformations such as cleft lip. We suggest that the OCDM can be useful not only for integrating craniofacial data, but also for expressing new knowledge gained from analyzing the integrated data © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We found that statutory definitions were often limited in problematic ways, such as focusing only on variants known to be associated with disease or negative health effects or associated with asymptomatic disease. Some statutes required complex levels of detail if applied to genomic technologies and set confusing disclosure standards for current use and future access. Others had exceptions from informed consent requirements for future research use, limited requirements for the destruction of specimens as opposed to derived data, or linked key definitional components to the evolving concept of “identifiability.” Further reform and research are needed to ensure that state law protections advance as rapidly as the science they aspire to enable.",

A scoping review was conducted to explore the existing knowledge of the evaluation and treatment of muscle and joint function in children with AMC. Three search engines were included and identified 1,271 articles. Eighty‐seven studies met the selection criteria and were included in this review. All included studies focused on joints, 30 of which also assessed the muscle. Assessment most often included the position of the contractures ( n = 72), as well as range of motion ( n = 66). Interventions to improve muscle and joint function were reported in 82 of the 87 papers and included surgery ( n = 70) and conservative interventions ( n = 74) with bony surgery (i.e., osteotomy) the most common surgery and rehabilitation the most common conservative intervention. Recurrences of contractures were mentioned in 46 of the 68 studies providing a follow‐up. Future studies should use validated measures to assess muscle and joint function, and conservative interventions should be described in greater detail and to include a longer follow‐up.",

Most patients are diagnosed in the light of a clinical checkup when consulting a fertility clinic with an unfulfilled child wish. Infertility in KS patients is caused by a massive germ cell loss, leading to azoospermia in more than 90% of the adult patients. Most seminiferous tubules in the adult KS testis are degenerated or hyalinized and testicular fibrosis can be observed, starting from puberty. However, focal spermatogenesis can be found in the testis of some patients. This offers the opportunity to extract spermatozoa from the testis by testicular sperm extraction (TESE). Nevertheless, TESE is only successful in about half of the KS adults seeking to father children. The reason for the germ cell loss remains unclear. To date, it is still debated whether the testicular tissue changes and the germ cell loss seen in KS is directly caused by an altered X‐linked gene expression, the altered somatic environment, or a deficiency in the germ cells. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about the germ cell loss in KS patients.",

In this retrospective, observational study of a consecutive cohort of 159 patients (134 families) with childhood‐onset (&lt;16 years of age) retinal dystrophy, molecular investigations, and in‐depth phenotyping were performed to determine key clinical and molecular characteristics. The most common ocular phenotype was rod‐cone dystrophy in 40 patients. Leber Congenital Amaurosis, the most severe form of retinal dystrophy, was present in 10 patients, and early onset severe retinal dystrophy in 22 patients.

Molecular diagnosis was achieved in 112 of 134 families (83.6%) by NGS gene panel investigation in 60 families, Sanger sequencing in 27 families, and Asper microarray in 25 families. An additional nine variants of uncertain significance were also found including three novel variants. Variants in 36 genes have been identified with the most common being ABCA4 retinopathy in 36 families. Five sporadic retinal dystrophy patients were found to have variants in dominant and X‐linked genes ( CRX , RHO , RP2 , and RPGR ) resulting in more accurate genetic counseling of inheritance for these families. Variants in syndromic associated genes including ALMS1 , SDCCAG8 , and PPT1 were identified in eight families enabling directed systemic care.",

The germ cell loss begins early in life leading to partial hyalinization of the testis at puberty, but the mechanistic drivers behind this remain poorly understood. In this systematic review, we summarize the current knowledge on developmental changes in the cellularity of KS gonads supplemented by a comparative analysis of the fetal and adult gonadal transcriptome, and blood transcriptome and methylome of men with KS. We identified a high fraction of upregulated genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation, thus supporting previous hypotheses that these are the main drivers of the testicular phenotype in KS. Enrichment analysis showed overrepresentation of genes from the X- and Y-chromosome and testicular transcription factors. Furthermore, by re-evaluation of recent single cell RNA-sequencing data originating from adult KS testis, we found novel evidence that the Sertoli cell is the most affected cell type. Our results are consistent with disturbed cross-talk between somatic and germ cells in the KS testis, and with X-escapee genes acting as mediators.",

We arrived at these diagnoses by conducting complete ophthalmic (National Eye Institute), auditory (National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders), and dental (National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research) evaluations, as well as laboratory and genetic testing. Retinal degeneration with macular cystic changes, amelogenesis imperfecta, and sensorineural hearing loss were features shared by the three patients. Patients A and C had pathogenic variants in PEX1 and Patient B, in PEX6 . Besides analyzing these cases, we review the literature regarding mild peroxisomal disorders, their pathophysiology, genetics, differential diagnosis, diagnostic methods, and management. We suggest that peroxisomal disorders are considered in every child with sensorineural hearing loss and retinal degeneration.

However, abdominal compression syndromes (CS) may also contribute to pain and dysfunction in these individuals and be the leading pathology given symptoms significantly reduce or cease after decompressive surgery. Arising not only in the abdomen and causing pain (median arcuate ligament syndrome [MALS] and superior mesenteric artery syndrome [SMAS]), CS also occur in the retroperitoneum and the pelvis (nutcracker syndrome and May-Thurner syndrome), these latter conditions causing chronic pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). Here, we report primarily on our experience of the assessment and management of MALS and SMAS in a cohort of cases with a surprising prevalence of HSD and hEDS. To our knowledge, this is the first cohort report of its kind in hEDS, HSD, and CS. We recommend that CS are considered in hEDS and HSD individuals with gastrointestinal and other painful complaints within the \"belt\" area. These CS can be identified using functional ultrasound duplex examination in experienced hands, and in appropriate cases stabilizing surgery can substantially improve quality of life.",

An adult Kidney Genetics Clinic was established within the nephrology division at a large urban academic medical center to increase access to genetic services and testing in adults with kidney disease. Between June 2019 and December 2021, a total of 363 patients were referred to the adult Kidney Genetics Clinic. Of those who completed genetic testing, a positive diagnostic finding was identified in 27.1%, a candidate diagnostic finding was identified in 6.7% of patients, and a nondiagnostic positive finding was identified in an additional 8.6% of patients, resulting in an overall yield of 42.4% for clinically relevant genetic findings in tested patients. A genetic diagnosis had implications for medical management, family member testing, and eligibility for clinical trials. With the utilization of telemedicine, genetic services reached a diverse geographic and patient population. Genetic education efforts were integral to the clinic's success, as they increased visibility and helped providers identify appropriate referrals. Ongoing access to genomic services will remain a fundamental component of patient care in adults with kidney disease.",

Therefore, all Volendam PCD patients seen at the Amsterdam UMC were included in this study. Data were collected on lung function, microbiology, radiology, and ear‐nose‐throat (ENT) symptoms. A mixed effects model estimated lung function decline in %point per year (95% confidence interval [CI]). Thirty‐three (60%) out of approximately 56 Volendam PCD patients were treated at our center and included in this study. Only 30% of patients had situs inversus. FEV 1 declined in children (−1.43%/year, CI: −1.80/−1.05), but not in adults (0.01%/year, CI: −0.36/0.38). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured in 21% of children and 60% of adults, respectively. Patients who have been infected at some point with P. aeruginosa had a steeper decline in FEV 1 as compared to patients that have never been infected. Neonatal symptoms (79%) and ENT problems (94%) were common; fertility issues however, were not (11%) common. Compared to other PCD cohorts, the Volendam/CCDC114 patients have a moderately severe phenotype with lung function decline predominantly occurring in childhood.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Most rare diseases are caused by single‐gene mutations, and as such, lend themselves to a host of new gene‐targeted therapies and technologies including antisense oligonucleotides, phosphomorpholinos, small interfering RNAs, and a variety of gene delivery and gene editing systems. Early successes are encouraging, however, given the substantial number of distinct rare diseases, the ability to scale these successes will be unsustainable without new development efficiencies. Herein, we discuss the need for genomic newborn screening to match pace with the growing development of targeted therapeutics and ability to rapidly develop individualized therapies for rare variants. We offer approaches to move beyond conventional “one disease at a time” preclinical and clinical drug development and discuss planned regulatory innovations that are necessary to speed therapy delivery to individuals in need. These proposals leverage the shared properties of platform classes of therapeutics and innovative trial designs including master and platform protocols to better serve patients and accelerate drug development. Ultimately, there are risks to these novel approaches; however, we believe that close partnership and transparency between health authorities, patients, researchers, and drug developers present the path forward to overcome these challenges and deliver on the promise of gene‐targeted therapies for rare diseases.",

It is already being used to interpret genome sequences and diagnose patients based on facial recognition. More recently, large‐language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have been tested for their capacity to provide medical genetics information. It was found that ChatGPT performed similarly to human respondents in factual and critical thinking questions, albeit with reduced accuracy in the latter. In particular, ChatGPT's performance in questions related to calculating the recurrence risk was dismal, despite only having to deal with a single disease. To see if challenging ChatGPT with more difficult problems may reveal its flaws and their bases, it was asked to solve recurrence risk problems dealing with two diseases instead of one. Interestingly, it managed to correctly understand the mode of inheritance of recessive diseases, yet it incorrectly calculated the probability of having a healthy child. Other LLMs were also tested and showed similar noise. This highlights a major limitation for clinical use. While this shortcoming may be solved in the near future, LLMs may not be ready yet to be used as an effective clinical tool in communicating medical genetics information.",

This study examined attitudes of early-onset breast cancer survivors concerning whether, at what age, and how their children should be educated about potential risk for hereditary breast cancer. Women with breast cancer diagnosed < age 50 years between 1994 and 1997 were recruited from 34 Virginia hospitals. Participants responded to two surveys. The Family History Questionnaire permitted participant classification into two groups based on risk for hereditary disease, as determined by personal and family history. The Knowledge, Attitudes and Beliefs Questionnaire addressed participants' concerns regarding their children's breast cancer risk, perceptions of their children's concerns about their own risk, and whether, at what age, and from what source their children should be informed about their own risk. Among 267 participants, the average age was 47.5 years; 90% were Caucasian, 7% were African American; 52% had suspected hereditary breast cancer. Of participants with children, 81% indicated concern about their children's breast cancer risk; 55% reported that their children had expressed concern about their own risk. Seventy-one percent of participants believed the age for informing children about hereditary breast cancer risk to be before 18 years. Eighty-four percent cited the child's parents and 65% cited health professionals as a preferred information source. No differences in responses between participants with suspected hereditary breast cancer versus presumed sporadic breast cancer were noted. These data establish the need for educational resources regarding hereditary breast cancer for children of early-onset breast cancer survivors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Developmental disabilities (DDs) are conditions characterized by physical, cognitive, psychological, sensory, adaptive, and/or communication impairments manifested during development. Approximately 17% of individuals in the United States 18 years and younger have a DD, and for most children the cause of their condition is unknown. Of particular interest are the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), characterized by unusual social, communication, and behavioral development. Previously autism was thought to be a rare condition, but the number of children receiving services for an ASD has increased dramatically in the last decade. Concerns about increases in DDs, particularly ASDs, their causes, and the high costs of intervention have highlighted the need for systematic public health monitoring. Service provider data, such as annual reporting of special education services or of state DD programs, do not provide a complete estimate of the rates for DDs, including ASDs. Unlike genetic metabolic disorders or congenital hearing loss (HL) for which newborn screening programs can provide accurate prevalence rates, there are currently no genetic or biologic markers for the ASDs to enable consistent and early identification of affected children. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program (MADDSP) is a model for population monitoring of ASDs/DDs that has been implemented in other states. This article discusses the role of ASD/DD tracking in public health, as well as the challenges of ASD/DD tracking, including case definition and identification, associated conditions, linkages, and data access. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although recent research has investigated the attitudes of parents, professionals, and adult siblings toward carrier testing of minors, no studies have focused on the experiences of minor siblings of individuals with X‐linked and autosomal recessive conditions. To explore adolescent sisters' perceptions of their reproductive risks, attitudes toward carrier testing, and resources for information and support, we interviewed 14 parents and 9 sisters (ages 12–15) of males with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency disorder inherited in both an X‐linked recessive and autosomal recessive fashion. Our semistructured telephone interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and subjected to template analysis (a common qualitative methodology). Girls were all aware that CGD is an inherited condition and each had made an assessment of her reproductive risk. All girls considered their parents to be their best source of information and support, but girls had trouble initiating discussions for fear of upsetting their parents. All girls and parents considered eventual carrier testing vital for reproductive decision‐making and relationship‐building. However, girls favored carrier testing at a later age and expressed more concerns about psychological risks associated with testing than did their parents. When faced with the hypothetical situation of being offered carrier testing “tomorrow,” half of the parents and untested daughters disagreed on the desirability of the test, with parents more likely to favor testing. Including adolescent sisters in family‐based genetic counseling that provides an opportunity for age‐appropriate discussion of inheritance and the timing, risks, and benefits of carrier testing would be beneficial to them.

Similar success is on the horizon for bipolar affective disorder (BPAD), but significant challenges remain. In this review, we outline the basic concepts of linkage and association mapping for complex phenotypes. We point out important caveats inherent in both approaches, and review guidelines on the interpretation of linkage statistics and significance thresholds. We then apply these concepts to an evaluation of the present status of genetic linkage and association studies in BPAD. The challenges posed by locus heterogeneity, phenotype definition, and sample size requirements are given a detailed treatment. Despite these challenges, we argue that the way ahead remains firmly rooted in linkage studies, complemented by association studies in linked regions. This is the only truly genome‐wide approach currently available; it has succeeded in other complex phenotypes, and it is the surest strategy for mapping susceptibility genes in BPAD. Once these genes are identified, genetic mapping methods will yield to the other methods of 21st‐century molecular biology as we begin to elucidate the pathophysiology of BPAD. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

However, for most of these syndromes the pathogenic genes have yet to be identified. Currently there is every indication that identification of these genes will be a slow process if we continue to rely strictly upon clinical data. An alternative approach is the use of mouse models to complement the patient studies. Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS), caused by deletions in 4p16.3, is the first recognized subtelomeric deletion syndrome. As with other syndromes of this class, WHS has not yet been subjected to an intensive, systematic analysis using mouse models. Nonetheless, a significant number of targeted mutations have been introduced into mouse genomic region, 5B1, which is orthologous to 4p16.3. Included among these mutations are a series of deletions approximating the deletions in some patients. The mouse lines carrying these deletions display a remarkable concordance of phenotypes with the human patient's characteristics, strongly indicating that the mouse models can be used to phenocopy WHS. In this review, we will catalog the currently existing targeted mutations in mice in the regions orthologous to the WHS critical regions. For each mutation we will discuss the resulting phenotype and its potential relevance to the pathogenesis of the syndrome. Further, we will describe how the phenotypes of some of the mutations suggest new directions for the clinical studies. Finally we will outline approaches for the efficient creation of new mouse models of WHS going forward. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conscientious objection (CO) to genetic testing raises serious questions about what it means to be a health‐care professional (HCP). Most of the discussion about CO has focused on the logic of moral arguments for and against aspects of CO and has ignored the social context in which CO occurs. Invoking CO to deny services to patients violates both the professional's duty to respect the patient's autonomy and also the community standards that determine legitimate treatment options. The HCP exercising the right of CO may make it impossible for the patient to exercise constitutionally guaranteed rights to self‐determination around reproduction. This creates a decision‐making imbalance between the HCP and the patient that amounts to an abuse of professional power. To prevent such abuses, professionals who wish to refrain from participating have an obligation to warn prospective patients of their objections prior to establishing a professional–patient relationship or, if a relationship already exists, to arrange for alternative care expeditiously. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Members of organized religious groups may look to their faith traditions for guidance regarding the moral implications of prenatal diagnosis and intervention. Many denominations have doctrinal statements relevant to these deliberations. In this article, common spiritual issues arising in the genetic counseling encounter are described. Representative doctrinal positions, derived from the responses of 31 U.S. religious denominations to a survey relating to prenatal genetic counseling, are given. Because the long‐term adjustment of patients may be dependent in part on their ability to reconcile their actions with their faith traditions, genetic counselors best serve their patients when they invite discussion of matters of faith. Unless invited, patients may assume these topics are “off limits” or that care providers are indifferent to their beliefs. Although genetics professionals ought not assume the role of spiritual advisor, a working knowledge of doctrinal approaches should help counselors frame the issues, and avoid missteps. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Risheg et al. [Risheg et al. (2007); Nature Genetics 39:451–453] identified an identical mutation (p.R961W) in MED12 in six families with Opitz–Kaveggia syndrome, including a surviving affected man from the original family reported in 1974. The previously described behavior phenotype of hyperactivity, affability, and excessive talkativeness is very frequent in young boys with FG syndrome, along with socially oriented, attention‐seeking behaviors. We present case studies of five adult males who were previously published with the clinical diagnosis of FG syndrome and then subsequently proven by Risheg et al. [Risheg et al. (2007); Nature Genetics 39:451–453] to have the recurrent p.R961W mutation. These individuals had episodic and longstanding behavior patterns, sometimes aggressive or self‐abusing, that occurred more frequently in puberty and early adulthood. We try to describe the triggers for these behaviors, indicate how these behaviors change with advancing age, and suggest specific recommendations and interventional strategies based on the clinical histories of affected adolescent males with FG syndrome [Graham et al., 2008 ; Clark et al., 2009 ]. Young men who exhibit these behaviors may benefit from a careful examination to detect medical problems, use of mood stabilizers if needed, and/or behavioral intervention. The transition to a community living situation can be challenging without careful planning and timely behavioral intervention. They remain impulsive and can have aggressive outbursts when making the transition to adult life, but these challenges can be managed, as demonstrated by these clinical histories. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

All of the connective tissue signs and symptoms are variable in the WS population, but few factors other than age and gender are known to influence the phenotype. We examined a cohort of 205 individuals with WS for mutations in SERPINA1 , the gene that encodes alpha‐1‐antitrypsin (AAT), the inhibitor of elastase. Individuals with classic WS deletions and SERPINA1 genotypes PiMS or PiMZ were more likely than those with a SERPINA1 PiMM genotype to have joint dislocation or scoliosis. However, carrier status for AAT deficiency was not correlated with presence of inguinal hernia or with presence or severity of SVAS. These findings suggest that genes important in elastin metabolism are candidates for variability in the connective tissue abnormalities in WS. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Dubowitz syndrome was described in 1965 as a recognizable syndrome characterized by microcephaly, short stature, eczema, mild developmental delays, and an increased risk of malignancy. Since its original description, there have been over 200 reported cases though no single gene has been identified to explain a significant proportion of affected individuals. Since the last definitive review of Dubowitz syndrome in 1996, there have been 63 individuals with a clinical, or suspected, diagnosis of Dubowitz syndrome reported in 51 publications. These individuals show a markedly wide spectrum with respect to growth, facial gestalt, psychomotor development, and risk of malignancy; genetic causes were identified in 33% (21/63). Seven individuals had deleterious copy number variants, in particular deletions at 14q32 and 17q24 were reported and showed overlap with the Dubowitz phenotype. Several cases were shown to have single gene disorders that included de novo or biallelic pathogenic variants in several genes including NSUN2 and LIG4 frequently identified by next-generation sequencing methods. It appears that the inability to identify a single gene responsible for Dubowitz syndrome reflects its extreme clinical and genetic heterogeneity. However, detailed phenotyping combined with careful grouping of subsets of unsolved cases and in conjunction with data-sharing will identify novel disease genes responsible for additional cases. In the interim, for those clinically diagnosed with a Dubowitz phenotype, we recommend assessment by a Medical Geneticist, a microarray and, if available, clinical or research based genome-wide sequencing. Management suggestions, including decisions regarding malignancy screening in select patients will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (JHS/EDS-HT) is a hereditary connective tissue disorder affecting every bodily system. It is largely underdiagnosed by many practitioners, with the result of a considerable delay in diagnosis and, consequently, in the onset of adequate management schedule and treatment. Patients may also experience to be misbelieved, erroneously considered affected by a psychiatric or psychosomatic disorders, and rejected by the medical profession, which can lead to feelings of anger and resentment. Patient journeys are often long and complicated, but if doctors allowed the patient time to tell the full story, and were more prepared to think holistically, there may be a far more positive outcome. Here, the patients' perspective is presented with a narrative medicine approach, illustrating the tri-dimensional experience of a JHS/EDS-HT patient, who is also a Bowen Practitioner and a medical writer/educator. Narrative medicine would be invaluable in working with JHS/EDS-HT so that the patient can tell the story, and offer the practitioner a whole picture of her/his suffering and, often, the key for understanding the cause(s). Once this has been achieved, it might be possible to build upon a more positive and therapeutic dialogue which would result in better treatment and more effective management. It is also important for doctors to communicate with JHS/EDS-HT experts who will ultimately improve the patient journey and treatment outcomes of such a complex connective tissue disorder.",

In particular, there are a few radiological findings which are seen more commonly in NAI than in OI which may help guide clinician considerations regarding the probability of either of these diagnoses.

    "abstract": "CHARGE syndrome (CS) is a complex genetic disorder causing multiple birth defects and sensory deficits (hearing, vision, balance, smell). Genetic counseling in CS must include not only the provision of factual information about CS, its cause, and inheritance, but also information about the developmental implications of CS features, referral to appropriate resources, and assistance with psychosocial adaptation to this information. CS should be considered in patients with any of the major diagnostic features: coloboma, choanal atresia, semicircular canal anomalies, or cranial nerve anomalies. The prime candidates in the differential are 22q11.2 deletion and Kabuki syndromes. Evaluation of features of CS, dysmorphology examination, and genetic testing can usually distinguish between the three conditions. Genetic counseling is important from early on, to help the family understand the process of genetic diagnosis, to interpret information coming from other specialists and to provide support and resources. Parents can easily be overwhelmed with the complexity of issues facing their child at diagnosis and in the future. CS is a substantial burden on a child, with high early mortality, multiple illnesses, hospitalizations and surgeries, and apparent medical fragility throughout life. The medical complexity of CS disrupts family life and contributes to delayed development. Multiple sensory deficits (impaired vision, hearing, and balance) further contribute to delayed motor and language development despite many individuals with CS having normal intelligence. Early referral to specialists in deafblindness and sensory deficits is essential. Resources are available to assist genetic counselors in diagnosis, follow-up, and management of patients with CS.",

However, some well-established human malformation syndromes remain without a molecular diagnosis despite intensive investigation. This issue of Seminars mines the phenotypic entries in OMIM and estimates that of the documented 2,034 unsolved entries likely to represent a rare genetic disease, only 160 are well-established and possibly amenable to investigation. This issue also reviews well-characterized and extensively investigated human malformation syndromes and associations that remain unsolved, including the following: Dubowitz syndrome (MIM 223370%), Hallermann–Streiff syndrome (MIM 234100%), PHACE syndrome (MIM 606519), Oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome (MIM 164180), Aicardi syndrome (MIM 304050%), Gomez–Lopez–Hernandez syndrome and Rhombencephalosynapsis (MIM 601853%), VACTERL (MIM 192350%), and Nablus syndrome (MIM #608156). Possible explanations for their intractability to molecular diagnosis are explored, including genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, mosaicism, epigenetics, gene–environment interactions, and other non-Mendelian contributions. Finally, this issue of Seminars presents a path forward for these unsolved rare conditions and suggests a renewed focus on solving amendable OMIM disorders. It is clear that the way forward will require new technologies, global cooperation, and data sharing; these will also be necessary to help reach the vision of the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC), that is to enable all people living with a rare disease to receive an accurate diagnosis, care and available therapy within 1 year of coming to medical attention.",

The study also included a quantitative audit of research categorized as either predominantly biomedical or psychological in the medical and other scientific literature. The overwhelming majority of all surveyed stakeholders (84% and higher) rated both biomedical and psychological research in TS as “very important,” yet only approximately 9% of published research focused on psychological aspects of TS. The odds of women with TS identifying psychological research as “most important” was significantly lower ( OR : 0.607; 95% CI: 0.375, 0.982] than the odds of parents making the same prioritization. Despite the majority of participants rating research as very important, only approximately half‐rated participation in research as similarly important. The majority of respondents in all three groups (59%–73%) indicated they would “very likely” participate in research pertaining to eating or nutrition, quality of life, or genetic studies in TS. Substantially fewer expressed similar eagerness to participate in studies involving the study of a new medicine or medical device.

The goals of the estrogen replacement are to mimic the normal physical and social development for timing and progression of puberty. Treatment should begin at 11–12 years of age, with dose increases every 6 months over a 2–3 year period. Initiation with low doses of estrogen is crucial to preserve growth potential.

Mean gestational age was 38 weeks, 97% of children presented with lower extremity deformities, and 74% of neonatal interventions targeted the lower extremity. Newborns spent an average of 14 days in the hospital (range 2–56 days) mostly for diagnostic workup and feeding difficulties. Half (49%) of the sample had internal organ involvement. Genetic testing was done on 48% of the children, including chromosome studies, single gene, whole‐exome/genome sequencing, and/or microarray studies. Genetic findings were inconclusive in most.

The tool is freely available for download at www.hughesriskapps.net . We evaluated the implementation of PHP in four geographically diverse clinical sites. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted for patients seen prior to the study period and for patients who used the PHP to collect data on documentation of FHH, discussion of cystic fibrosis (CF) and hemoglobinopathy (HB) carrier screening, and CF and HB interventions (tests, referrals). Five hundred pre‐implementation phase and 618 implementation phase charts were reviewed. Documentation of a 3‐generation FHH or pedigree improved at three sites; patient race/ethnicity at three sites, father of the baby (FOB) race/ethnicity at all sites, and ancestry for the patient and FOB at three sites ( P &lt; 0.001–0001). CF counseling improved for implementation phase patients at one site (8% vs. 48%, P &lt; 0.0001) and CF screening/referrals at two (2% vs. 14%, P &lt; 0.0001; 6% vs. 14%; P = 0.05). Counseling and intervention rates did not increase for HB. This preliminary study suggests that the PHP can improve documentation of FHH, race, and ancestry, as well as the compliance with current CF counseling and intervention guidelines in some prenatal clinics. Future evaluation of the PHP should include testing in a larger number of clinical environments, assessment of additional performance measures, and evaluation of the system's overall clinical utility. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Neurobehavioral disorders comprised of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders together represent leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Despite significant academic research and industry efforts to elucidate the disease mechanisms operative in these disorders and to develop mechanism‐based therapies, our understanding remains incomplete and our access to tractable therapeutic interventions severely limited. The magnitude of these short‐comings can be measured by the growing list of disappointing clinical trials based on initially promising compounds identified in genetic animal models. This review and commentary will explore why this may be so, focusing on the central role that genetic models of neurobehavioral disorders have come to occupy in current efforts to identify disease mechanisms and therapies. In particular, we will highlight the unique pitfalls and challenges that have hampered success in these models as compared to genetic models of non‐neurological diseases as well as to symptom‐based models of the early 20th century that led to the discovery of all major classes of psychoactive pharmaceutical compounds still used today. Using examples from specific genetic rodent models of human neurobehavioral disorders, we will highlight issues of reproducibility, construct validity, and translational relevance in the hopes that these examples will be instructive toward greater success in future endeavors. Lastly, we will champion a two‐pronged approach toward identifying novel therapies for neurobehavioral disorders that makes greater use of the historically more successful symptom‐based approaches in addition to more mechanism‐based approaches.",

Identification of CHD7 as the major gene affected in CHARGE has enabled acceleration of research in this field. Great progress has been made in understanding the role of CHD7 in the development and function of the inner ear, as well as in related organs such as the middle ear and auditory and vestibular neural pathways. The goals of current research on CHD7 and CS are to (a) improve our understanding of the pathology caused by CHD7 pathogenic variants and (b) to provide better tools for prognosis and treatment. Current studies utilize cells and whole animals, from flies to mammals. The mouse is an excellent model for exploring mechanisms of Chd7 function in the ear, given the evolutionary conservation of ear structure, function, Chd7 expression, and similarity of mutant phenotypes between mice and humans. Newly recognized developmental functions for mouse Chd7 are shedding light on how abnormalities in CHD7 might lead to CS symptoms in humans. Here we review known human inner ear phenotypes associated with CHD7 pathogenic variants and CS, summarize progress toward diagnosis and treatment of inner ear-related pathologies, and explore new avenues for treatment based on basic science discoveries.",

    "abstract": "One of the traits most consistently seen in females with Turner syndrome is premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). The biological mechanisms underlying the germ cell atresia that leads to infertility in most women with Turner syndrome are unclear. Given that telomeres are important for proper chromosomal pairing and other early steps in meiosis and oogenesis, one can conjecture that perturbations in telomere length and/or function might contribute to the POI associated with Turner syndrome. Also, one can speculate that epigenetic modifications that arise in response to asynapsis, as well as the resetting of the epigenome during embryogenesis, could contribute to monosomy X‐related germ cell atresia. Moreover, errors in recombination‐based DNA repair might contribute to the failure of cells lacking all, or a portion of, a second sex chromosome to successfully complete oogenesis. This article presents a review of the extant literature related to telomere length and/or epigenetic patterns associated with POI in females with a monosomy X complement (in humans and animal models). A goal of this review is to inspire researchers to use new technological advances to better characterize the components of the biological cascade leading to early germ cell loss in females with Turner syndrome.",

Furthermore, genetic association studies may uncover biomarkers that can be used to identify susceptible individuals, and contribute toward developing vaccine and novel therapeutic targets. Genetic predisposition to rheumatic fever and RHD has been hypothesized by findings from familial studies and observed associations between genes located in the human leukocyte antigens on chromosome 6p21.3 and elsewhere in the genome. We sought to summarize, from published Genetic association studies in RHD, evidence on genetic variants implicated in RHD susceptibility. Using HuGENet™ systematic review methods, we evaluated 66 studies reporting on 42 genes. Existing meta‐analyses of candidate gene studies suggest that TGF‐β1 [rs1800469], and IL‐1β [rs2853550] single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute to susceptibility to RHD, whereas the TNF‐α [rs1800629 and rs361525], TGF‐β1 [rs1800470 and rs4803457], IL‐6 [rs1800795], IL‐10 [rs1800896] were not associated with RHD. However, candidate gene studies in RF/RHD are relatively small, thus lacking statistical power to identify reliable and reproducible findings, emphasizing the need for large‐scale multicenter studies with different populations.",

They are characterized by similar clinical features, among which feeding difficulties, growth delay, and gastro‐intestinal disorders are frequent, causing pain and discomfort in patients. Hereby, we describe the main nutritional and gastrointestinal issues reported in individuals with RASopathies, specifically in Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome‐related disorders, Costello, and cardio‐facio‐cutaneous syndromes. Fifty percent of children with Noonan syndrome may experience feeding difficulties that usually have a spontaneous resolution by the second year of life, especially associated to genes different than PTPN11 and SOS1 . More severe manifestations often require artificial enteral nutrition in infancy are observed in Costello syndrome, mostly associated to c.34G&gt;A substitution in the HRAS gene. In cardio‐facio‐cutaneous syndrome feeding issues are usually present (90–100% of cases), especially in individuals carrying variants in BRAF , MAP2K1 , and MAP2K2 genes, and artificial enteral intervention, even after scholar age, may be required. Moreover, disorders associated with gastrointestinal dysmotility as gastro‐esophageal reflux and constipation are commonly reported in all the above‐mentioned syndromes. Given the impact on growth and on the quality of life of these patients, early evaluation and prompt personalized management plans are fundamental.",

    "abstract": "Abstract RASopathies are rare genetic disorders caused by germline pathogenic variants in genes belonging to the RAS/MAPK pathway, which signals cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and death. The dysfunction of such signaling pathway causes syndromes with overlapping clinical manifestations. Skin and adnexal lesions are the cardinal clinical signs of RASopathies, such as cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, formerly known as LEOPARD syndrome, Costello syndrome, neurofibromatosis (NF1), Legius syndrome, Noonan‐like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NSLH) and Noonan syndrome. As NF1, one of the most common RASopathies, described in 1882, has its clinical features well delineated, we will focus on the dermatological diagnosis, management and care of non‐NF1 RASopathies, which are less known and more recently described. Dermatological manifestations are important clinical diagnostic elements that can aid differential diagnosis among RASopathies. They can affect dermis and epidermis, causing pigmented lesions (melanocytic nevi, café‐au‐lait spots, and lentigines), hyperkeratosis (keratosis pilaris, ulerythema ophryogenes, and palmoplantar keratosis) or hyperplasia. To date there are rare known links to malignancy, but oftentimes skin lesions require close attention because they can highly affect quality of life.",

Our objective was to understand caregiver‐reported experiences and concerns for themselves and the individual they care for through a survey of caregivers of adults with Down syndrome. We conducted a survey of N = 438 caregivers of adults with Down syndrome and asked about the perspectives of the respondents surrounding caregiving and demographics. The most common concerns among caregivers were planning for future needs (72.1%) and what happens when they (the caregiver) are gone (68.3%). Concerns they had for the individual they cared for were employment (63.2%) and friendships/relationships (63.2%). We found no significant difference in responses based on caregiver education level. Our survey identified six themes for the feedback about what clinical and research professionals should know to better serve individuals with Down syndrome, their families, and those who support them. Many caregivers discussed topics including healthcare, coordination, competence, and ability. More efforts for research into the caregiver experience for adults with Down syndrome are needed.",

Examination using validated instruments for cognitive, psychiatric, and global functional problems in the context of an in‐depth clinical evaluation found adult age stability of NDD diagnoses made in childhood, however, rates increased at follow‐up. Rates of anxiety, mood, and psychotic disorders were high, with a majority meeting diagnostic criteria for one or more psychiatric disorder. The rate of psychotic disorders was much lower compared to many other studies. Variability in functioning at follow‐up was primarily associated with intellectual ability at T1. The findings obtained highlight the increased risk of NDD and psychiatric problems and of cognitive impairment and reduced levels of global functioning over time.

Initial testing and qualitative input was used to develop four stimulus paradigms capturing social and cognitive processes, including social attention, receptive vocabulary, processing speed, and single‐word reading. The paradigms were administered to a sample of 375 participants, including 163 with NDGS, 56 with idiopathic neurodevelopmental disability (NDD), and 156 neurotypical controls. Twelve measures were created from the four stimulus paradigms. Valid completion rates varied from 87 to 100% across measures, with lower but adequate completion rates in participants with intellectual disability. Adequate to excellent internal consistency reliability ( α = 0.67 to 0.95) was observed across measures. Test–retest reproducibility at 1‐month follow‐up and stability at 4‐month follow‐up was fair to good ( r = 0.40–0.73) for 8 of the 12 measures. All gaze‐based measures showed evidence of convergent and discriminant validity with parent‐report measures of other cognitive and behavioral constructs. Comparisons across NDGS groups revealed distinct patterns of social and cognitive functioning, including people with PTEN mutations showing a less impaired overall pattern and people with SYNGAP1 mutations showing more attentional, processing speed, and social processing difficulties relative to people with NFIX mutations. Webcam‐collected performance measures appear to be a reliable and potentially useful method for objective characterization and monitoring of social and cognitive processes in NDGS and idiopathic NDD. Additional validation work, including more detailed convergent and discriminant validity analyses and examination of sensitivity to change, is needed to replicate and extend these observations.",

We found that for the subset of the 4‐year cohort for which there was a 233% increase in the number of disorders screened (from 9 to 30 disorders), there was a 31% increase in the number of affected infants identified by the screen. We project that if all states in the program expanded their services and if the incidence of disorders is similar across states, there would be an observed 45% increase in the number of infants detected by the screen and a 43% increase in the number of infants for whom the screening algorithm would require some contact with the infants' health care provider. Furthermore, of those requiring contact, we project a 300% increase in the number of screened‐positive infants who would be referred to tertiary care centers for a diagnostic evaluation. Increased contact with the medical community from additions to newborn screening as demonstrated in this report emphasizes the need for an approach in which the newborn screening program assures coordinated communications between birth units, laboratory, primary health care providers, and specialists. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Sixty‐three individuals from a single kindred with a known BRCA1 mutation rated uncertainty about 12 items on a five‐point Likert scale before and 1 month after genetic counseling/testing. Factor analysis identified a five‐item total uncertainty scale that was sensitive to changes before and after testing. The items in the scale were related to uncertainty about obtaining health care, positive changes after testing, and coping well with results. The majority of participants (76%) rated reducing uncertainty as an important reason for genetic testing. The importance of reducing uncertainty was stable across time and unrelated to anxiety or demographics. Yet, at baseline, total uncertainty was low and decreased after genetic counseling/testing ( P = 0.004). Analysis of individual items showed that after genetic counseling/testing, there was less uncertainty about the participant detecting cancer early ( P = 0.005) and coping well with their result ( P &lt; 0.001). Our findings support the importance to clients of genetic counseling/testing as a means of reducing uncertainty. Testing may help clients to reduce the uncertainty about items they can control, and it may be important to differentiate the sources of uncertainty that are more or less controllable. Genetic counselors can help clients by providing anticipatory guidance about the role of uncertainty in genetic testing. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

As with most genetic disorders, the past few years have witnessed a dramatic leap in our understanding of the molecular basis of these malformations that include both constitutional and post-zygotic (or mosaic) genetic aberrations. This is best exemplified by the recent identification of mutations within components of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in hemimegalencephaly and megalencephaly syndromes, and the rapidly increased identification of mutations within the tubulin family in a broad range of cortical and non-cortical brain malformations. These discoveries, particularly of the emerging \"tubulinopathies\" spectrum, have not only expanded our knowledge of these disorders but challenge our existing, and perhaps overly simplistic, classification of these malformations based on the primary neuronal stage at which the abnormality occurs. It is our hope that this series will facilitate a deeper understanding of these malformations beyond their clinical and neuroimaging features and syndromic associations to their molecular and pathway underpinnings. We believe this knowledge will most certainly be instrumental as we move into the era of delineating genotype-phenotype correlations and, ultimately, pathway-based therapies.",

Based on a review of 40 patients with OCCS, existing clinical criteria have been revised. Because of the asymmetric and patchy distribution of features, lack of recurrence in families, male preponderance and completely skewed X-inactivation in one female, OCCS is hypothesized to result from postzygotic mosaic variants in an X-linked gene. Whole exome and genome sequencing on blood DNA in two patients failed to identify pathogenic variants so far. In view of the overlapping features, in particular of the brain, of OCCS and Aicardi syndrome, both may be pathogenetically related or even result from different variants in the same gene. For the elucidation of the cause of OCCS, exome or genome sequencing on multiple lesional tissues is the primary goal.",

    "abstract": "Development of the craniofacial region is a remarkably complex and tightly orchestrated process. It is therefore not surprising that genetic and environmental insults frequently result in craniofacial anomalies. Nonetheless, our knowledge of their etiology and pathogenesis is still scarce, limiting our efforts at prevention. Furthermore, few standardized protocols have been developed to guide clinical and surgical interventions. In this Issue of the Seminars, reviews on the most recent research advances on craniofacial conditions, from genomics and epigenetics to ontology and medical care are discussed with emphasis on the most common anomalies of the craniofacial region: orofacial clefts, craniosynostosis, craniofacial microsomia, facial dysostosis, Robin sequence, jaw and dentition anomalies, and anterior neural tube defects. Phenotypic variability and the importance of detailed characterization using standardized terminology to better distinguish between phenotypes, new technologies (and their limitations) for genetic diagnosis, and the use of mouse models to study these conditions in both their complex phenotypic and genetic aspects are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "There is an abundance of information in the literature on patient experiences with Internet support groups (ISGs). However, studies exploring these experiences in a rare disease population are scarce, even though these families are often at a disadvantage for resources, reliable information, and support. The aim of the current study was to explore the experiences with ISGs for parents of children with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a rare genetic diagnosis, in order to better understand the impact on emotional support and their child's medical care. Focus groups were conducted to inform the design of a large-scale internet survey. The survey asked parents closed- and open-ended questions regarding experiences with ISGs, with a focus on the psychosocial, medical, and logistical aspects. The survey found that 141/170 (82.6%) respondents have visited an Internet-based support group to find support or information about their child's CdLS diagnosis. The majority of respondents (71.7%) reported that ISGs have been helpful in finding emotional support, with the most common areas impacted as a result of ISG participation being behavior toward their children and family dynamic. Regarding medical care, most respondents (63.9%) reported that ISGs have been helpful in finding medical information and support, with the most commonly impacted areas of their child's care including day-to-day management, diet, therapy interventions, and healthcare providers. These findings provide a greater understanding of the role of Internet networking in healthcare and may inform future approaches to medical care and psychosocial support for rare, complex genetic diagnoses. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Multiple loci have been associated with HPE in humans, and potential causative genes at 14 of these loci have been identified. Although TGIF1 (originally TGIF, for Thymine Guanine‐Interacting Factor) is among the most frequently screened genes in HPE patients, an understanding of how mutations in this gene contribute to the pathogenesis of HPE has remained elusive. However, mouse models based on loss of function of Tgif1 , and the related Tgif2 gene, have shed some light on how human TGIF1 variants might cause HPE. Functional analyses of TGIF proteins and of TGIF1 single nucleotide variants from HPE patients, combined with analysis of forebrain development in mouse embryos lacking both Tgif1 and Tgif2 , suggest that TGIFs regulate the transforming growth factor ß/Nodal signaling pathway and sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling independently. Although, some developmental processes that are regulated by TGIFs may be Nodal‐dependent, it appears that the forebrain patterning defects and HPE in Tgif mutant mouse embryos is primarily due to altered signaling via the Shh pathway.",

Until now, six patients with this condition have been reported in the literature. In addition to skeletal overgrowth, these patients exhibit hyperelastic, translucent, and fragile skin, scoliosis, progressive loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue, skull deformity, infantile myofibromas, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and arachnoid cysts in the posterior fossa and periventricular white matter signal abnormalities on neuroimaging. This constellation of phenotypes clearly distinguishes KOGS from other PDGFRB ‐related disorders, including idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, infantile myofibroma, and Penttinen‐type premature aging syndrome. From a molecular standpoint, PDGFRB is a dimeric receptor tyrosine kinase that plays critical roles in cell growth and tumorigenesis. The two known types of pathogenic variants (p.(Pro584Arg) and p.(Trp566Arg)) of the PDGFRB that cause KOGS are exclusively located in the juxtaglomerular domain that regulates autoactivation/inhibition of PDGFRB. In‐vitro evidence suggests that p.(Pro584Arg) represents a gain‐of‐function pathogenic variant. Inhibition of PDGFRB activity using multi‐kinase inhibitors appears to be a potentially promising therapeutic approach. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease using induced pluripotent stem cells is under way. Presence of skeletal overgrowth, distinctive facial features, characteristic hyperelastic and fragile skin, and cerebral white matter lesions with neuropsychiatric symptoms should prompt genetic analysis of the PDGFRB .",

Variants are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with variable expressivity. De novo variants have been reported, however their overall frequency is largely unknown. We sought to determine the rate of de novo, pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in children with a diagnosis of hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy (HCM, DCM, or RCM), and to compare disease outcomes between individuals with and without a de novo variant. A retrospective record review identified 126 individuals with HCM (55%), DCM (37%), or RCM (8%) ≤18 years of age who had genetic testing. Overall, 50 (40%) had positive genetic testing and 18% of P/LP variants occurred de novo. The rate of de novo variation in those with RCM (80%) was higher than in those with HCM (9%) or DCM (20%). There was evidence of germline mosaicism in one family with RCM. Individuals with de novo variants were more likely than those without to have a history of arrhythmia ( p = .049), sudden cardiac arrest ( p = .024), hospitalization ( p = .041), and cardiac transplantation ( p = .030). The likelihood of de novo variation and impact on family risk and screening should be integrated into genetic counseling.",

Accurate estimates of the burden of CHD among school children are often lacking. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of CHD among school children in two communities (urban and semi-urban) in south western Nigeria. Using clinical assessment and portable echocardiography, 4107 school children aged 5 years to 16 years in Lagos, Nigeria, were selected using a multistage sampling procedure and screened for CHD. Diagnosis of CHD was made after echocardiography. Children identified with CHD were referred to a tertiary hospital for appropriate cardiac care. The 4,107 children screened had a mean age of 11.3 ± 2.7 years and 53.7% were females. Twenty seven children had echocardiography-confirmed CHD, representing a prevalence of CHD among school children in Lagos, Nigeria of 6.6 per 1000 children. Acyanotic CHD constituted 96.3% of detected cases. Two children diagnosed with CHD (Tetralogy of Fallot and severe pulmonary valve stenosis respectively) had successful intervention. The prevalence of previously undiagnosed CHD among school children in Lagos Nigeria is substantial and highlights gaps in the health care system and school health programs. Echocardiographic screening of school children provides an opportunity for missed early diagnosis and treatment of CHD and reduces the prevalence of first-diagnosed CHD in adulthood. Therefore, focused clinical examination of school children followed by echocardiography is a strategy that could bridge this diagnostic and treatment gap in CHD.",

The phenotype includes tall stature, hypotonia, neuropsychiatric comorbidities, and an increased risk of infertility in adulthood. Little is known about testicular function in childhood and adolescence in 47,XYY. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess testicular function serum biomarkers, including total testosterone, inhibin B, and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), in 82 boys with XYY (11.3 ± 3.8 years) compared with 66 male controls (11.6 ± 3.8 years). The association of testicular hormones with physical features, neuropsychological phenotype, and magnetoencephalography (MEG) was assessed with multiple linear regression models. Results indicate males with XYY have significantly lower inhibin B (median 84 pg/ml vs. 109 pg/ml, p = .004) and higher AMH (median 41 ng/ml vs. 29 ng/ml, p = .011); however, testosterone, testicular volume, and stretched penile length were not different from controls. In the exploratory analysis of relationships between hormone concentrations and phenotypic assessments, higher inhibin B concentrations were positively correlated with lower BMI and better cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes in the XYY group. Testosterone concentrations were positively associated with better behavioral outcomes in boys with XYY. Higher testosterone and inhibin B concentrations were also associated with shorter auditory latencies measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in XYY. With a few exceptions, testicular hormones were not associated with phenotypic outcomes in controls. In conclusion, there is evidence of subtle impaired testicular function in boys with XYY and a newly described relationship between measures of testicular function and some aspects of the XYY phenotype.",

This Introduction describes a case of suspected child abuse in an 8‐month‐old baby referred to clinical genetics to exclude osteogenesis imperfecta. The experience from this case raised medical and ethical considerations and prompted consideration of the role of the clinical geneticist in distinguishing rare mimics of child abuse from real cases. From this single case, and a discussion regarding similar cases, arose the idea of this issue in Seminars in Medical Genetics, Genetic Differentials of Child Abuse: Is Your Case Rare or Real? In thinking about child abuse from a clinical genetics perspective, we categorize clinical presentations into fractures, skin lesions, hemorrhage, growth disturbances, and concern for caregiver‐fabricated illness (previously known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy). In this Introduction, we also discuss recent questions regarding Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and infantile fractures and concerns about caregiver‐fabricated illness in the context of mitochondrial or other rare diseases. The goal is that this issue on child abuse and genetics will serve as a resource to help distinguish the rare causes from the real cases of child abuse, and those critical distinctions and correct diagnoses may be life‐saving for some infants and children. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

It impacts the primitive ectoderm and mesoderm, affecting skin, teeth, nails, hair, musculoskeletal development, and vision and hearing. To date, there has been no systematic research examining the psychoeducational impact of the disorder. The current study examined emotional, behavioral, adaptive, and intellectual ability in 17 subjects with ages ranging from 3 to 55 with FDH attending the 2013 Annual Family Conference of the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias. Findings suggested overall average functioning in all areas. However, wide variability was noted in this sample, with 3 participants (18%) exhibiting overall cognitive ability in the borderline to impaired range. These findings are consistent with previous reports suggesting intellectual impairment in 15% of persons with FDH. Similarly, a subgroup of children was rated by parents as exhibiting difficulties with behavior (2 out of 11; 18%) and emotions (5 out of 11; 45%). Of particular concern was withdrawn behavior, reported by 65% of parents. These findings suggest that clinicians should routinely screen persons with FDH to rule out cognitive and emotional/behavioral difficulties and offer timely treatment. Future research should focus on identifying risk factors for psychoeducational problems in this population. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Frequently, however, these opportunities are limited by the lack of knowledge about the normal functions of the affected genes. In many cases, there is more information about the gene's orthologs in model organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster . Despite almost a billion years of evolutionary divergence, over three‐quarters of genes linked to human diseases have Drosophila homologs. With a short generation time, a twenty‐fold smaller genome, and unique genetic tools, the conserved functions of genes are often more easily elucidated in Drosophila than in other organisms. Here we present how this applies to Cornelia de Lange syndrome, as a model for how Drosophila can be used to increase understanding of genetic syndromes caused by mutations with broad effects on gene transcription and exploited to develop novel therapies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Individuals with Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) show an increased incidence of developmental dyslexia and individuals with Turner Syndrome (TS) are often affected by developmental dyscalculia. Accordingly, KS frequently coincides with verbal deficits, and TS with visual–spatial impairments. Though neurocognitive profiles of KS and TS are well‐established, little is known about the neurobiology underling learning in SCA. This review summarizes current structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in KS and TS related to literacy and mathematical skills. It includes studies that focus on correlates between brain anatomy and cognition in SCA and on functional brain responses during learning‐related tasks and at rest. We highlight important neural circuits that are related to domain‐specific skills of literacy and mathematics. We discuss how identifying neuroendophenotypes of learning in SCA might contribute to developing a novel framework for SLD that accounts for potential genetic effects on learning, and from the X and Y chromosomes specifically. Future research directions are considered to establish clear brain‐behavior relationships that might ultimately improve the treatment of SLD in SCA across development.",

Here, we modeled relationships between general cognitive ability (estimated using full‐scale IQ [FSIQ] from Wechsler scales) and regional estimates of SA and CT (from structural MRI scans) in both aneuploid (28 XXX, 55 XXY, 22 XYY, 19 XXYY) and typically‐developing euploid (79 XX, 85 XY) individuals. Results indicated widespread decoupling of normative anatomical–cognitive relationships in SCA: we found five regions where SCA significantly altered SA–FSIQ relationships, and five regions where SCA significantly altered CT–FSIQ relationships. The majority of areas were characterized by the presence of positive anatomy‐IQ relationships in health, but no or slightly negative anatomy‐IQ relationships in SCA. Disrupted anatomical–cognitive relationships generalized from the full cohort to karyotypically defined subcohorts (i.e., XX‐XXX; XY‐XYY; XY‐XXY), demonstrating continuity across multiple supernumerary SCA conditions. As the first direct evidence of altered regional neuroanatomical–cognitive relationships in supernumerary SCA, our findings shed light on potential genetic and structural correlates of the cognitive phenotype in SCA, and may have implications for other neurogenetic disorders.",

Great strides have been made toward identifying the genetic basis for these conditions over the last 30 years—more than 270 different genes involved in syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of retinal dystrophies have now been identified. The identification of these genes and the improvement of clinical laboratory techniques have led to the identification of the genetic basis of disease in 56–76% of patients with IRDs through next generation sequencing and copy number variant analysis. Genetic testing is an essential part of clinical care for patients affected with IRDs and is required to confirm the diagnosis, understand the inheritance of the condition, and determine eligibility for gene‐specific treatments or clinical trials. Despite the success achieved in determining the genetic cause of these conditions, several challenges remain, which must be considered when providing genetic testing and genetic counseling to patients. For this reason, an integrated team of ophthalmic and genetic clinicians who are familiar with these challenges is necessary to provide optimal comprehensive care to these patients.",

After a mean of ±2years (IC 95:0.73–3.27), approximately 30% of the variants of uncertain significance were reclassified as pathogenic. The use of next generation sequencing methods has facilitated the identification of both germline and mosaic pathogenic variants, expanding the diagnostic yield.

    "abstract": "Joint hypermobility (JHM), defined as an increased range of joint motion, is a frequent somatic trait in the general population but also the hallmark of many of the hereditary disorders of connective tissue. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) belong to this group of diseases and are characterized by tissue fragility, skin abnormalities, and JHM. Between JHM and EDS, there are the so-called hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD), which is an umbrella term referring to people with symptomatic JHM who do not fulfill criteria for a syndromic connective tissue disorder such as EDS. Among the variety of clinical correlates of JHM/HSD/EDS, neurodevelopmental atypisms are common although often not screened for and identified in the clinical setting. This article reviews the pertinent literature concerning neurodevelopmental conditions for which there is some evidence of an association with JHM/HSD/EDS. These include hyperactivity and attention deficit, learning, communication, and motor problems including tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome and autism spectrum disorders. Underlying mechanism hypotheses for such interconnections are also reviewed. The coexistence of connective tissue-altered conditions and neurodevelopmental atypisms increases disability in patients from an early age. Thus, increased awareness among clinicians and researchers is necessary to promote assessment, diagnosis, and develop management strategies to meet the specific needs of those affected.",

    "abstract": "Persons with the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) report a wide range of respiratory symptoms, most commonly shortness of breath, exercise limitation, and cough. Also reported are noisy breathing attributed to asthma, difficulty with deep inhalation, and inspiratory thoracic pain. The literature consists of case reports and small cross-sectional and cohort studies. One case-control study estimated twofold to threefold greater respiratory disease burden among persons with EDS as compared to controls. The differential diagnosis for symptoms is broad. Structural alterations include pectus deformities, scoliosis, recurrent rib subluxations, and tracheobronchomalacia, associated with varying degrees of physiologic impairment. Those with vascular EDS have an increased risk of pneumothorax, intrapulmonary bleeding, cysts, and nonmalignant fibrous nodules. Functional aerodigestive manifestations such as inducible laryngeal obstruction may be misdiagnosed as asthma, with gastro-esophageal dysmotility and reflux as common contributing factors. Inflammatory manifestations include costochondritis, bronchiectasis, and localized respiratory allergic and nonallergic mast cell activation. Cranio-cervical instability can dysregulate respiratory control pathways. There is a need for careful phenotyping using standardized clinical tools and patient-reported outcomes and continuing collaboration with aerodigestive specialists including otolaryngologists and gastroenterologists. Also needed is further evaluation of respiratory symptoms in persons with hypermobility spectrum disorders. Personalized monitoring strategies are invaluable for interpretation and long-term management of respiratory symptoms.",

PHS may also include a wide range of clinical phenotypes affecting multiple organ systems including congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). The observed clinical phenotypes are consistent with the essential role of GLI3, a transcriptional effector in the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, in organogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which truncation of GLI3 in PHS results in such a variety of clinical phenotypes with variable severity, even within the same organ, remain unclear. In this study we focus on presentation of CAKUT in PHS. A systematic analysis of reported PHS patients ( n = 78) revealed a prevalence of 26.9% (21/78) of CAKUT. Hypoplasia (± dysplasia) and agenesis were the two main types of CAKUT; bilateral and unilateral CAKUT were reported with equal frequency. Examination of clinical phenotypes with CAKUT revealed a significant association between CAKUT and craniofacial defects, bifid epiglottis and a Disorder of Sex Development, specifically affecting external genitalia. Lastly, we determined that PHS patients with CAKUT predominately had substitution type variants (as opposed to deletion type variants in non‐CAKUT PHS patients) in the middle third of the GLI3 gene. These results provide a foundation for future work aimed at uncovering the molecular mechanisms by which variant GLI3 result in the wide range and severity of clinical features observed in PHS.",

Infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) and other forms of epilepsy are among the most serious complications. To investigate clinical presentation, treatment outcomes, and genotype-phenotype associations in CFCS patients with IESS, molecular genetics and clinical neurological history were reviewed across two large clinical research cohorts (n = 180). IESS presented in 18/180 (10%) cases, including 16 patients with BRAF variants and 2 with MAP2K1 variants. Among IESS patients with BRAF variants, 16/16 (100%) had sequence changes affecting the protein kinase domain (exons 11-16), although only 57% of total BRAF variants occurred in this domain. Clinical onset of spasms occurred at a median age of 5.4 months (range: 1-24 months). Among 13/18 patients whose IESS resolved with anti-seizure medications, 10 were treated with ACTH and/or vigabatrin. A substantial majority of CFCS patients with IESS subsequently developed other epilepsy types (16/18; 89%). In terms of neurodevelopmental outcomes, gross motor function and verbal communication were more limited in patients with a history of IESS compared to those without IESS. These findings can inform clinical neurological care guidelines for CFCS and development of relevant pre-clinical models for severe epilepsy phenotypes.",

In mice, GNB1 haploinsufficiency has been associated with retinal dystrophy. In humans, however, although vision and eye movement abnormalities are common in individuals with GNB1-related disorder, rod-cone dystrophy is not yet an established feature of this condition. We expand the phenotype of GNB1-related disorder with the first confirmed report of rod-cone dystrophy in an affected individual, and contribute to a further understanding of the natural history of this condition in a mildly affected 45-year-old adult.",

The Consensus Conference of the American College of Medical Genetics has suggested that \"neuroimaging appears to have an especially important role in patients with microcephaly or macrocephaly, seizures, loss of psychomotor skills and neurologic signs,\" whereas the value of neuroimaging investigations \"in the normocephalic patient without focal neurological signs is unclear\" [Curry et al., 1997]. However, recent literature reports show how the latest neuroimaging techniques (in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy [H-MRS]) may prove to be useful in the diagnostic process of those individuals with DD/MR and no neurological signs/symptoms. The use of these techniques can, in addition, help in monitoring treatment in distinct metabolic disorders. This review will focus on the usefulness of neuroimaging studies in some of the newer metabolic disorders. This paper will also cover those recognizable patterns of human malformation where neuroimaging findings seem to be relevant both toward diagnosis and management, and add to our understanding of the related behavior phenotype. The essential role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the progress in the diagnostic recognition of malformations of cerebral cortical development is stressed.",

Numbers of families at many research sites are now large, and new collaborations among these groups will allow for collections of subjects with enough statistical power to detect relatively small gene effects. New technological advances in genotyping will allow for more fine‐grained genetic analysis, and more sophisticated techniques have been developed to address the vast amounts of data acquired. Researchers have also begun to focus on intermediate phenotypes associated with autism, such as elevated serotonin, increased head circumference, social difficulties, or language impairment or delay. These phenotypes may help to stratify affected cases into more genetically homogeneous subgroups, and may also occur in their clinically unaffected relatives. The study of intermediate phenotypes may allow investigators to find common gene variants that lead to autism susceptibility.

An understanding of the pathophysiology of various genetic disorders has provided researchers the opportunity to propose and test pharmacologic agents in preclinical murine models with hopes of translation to human trials. The development of clinical trials can be costly and time consuming, particularly for rare conditions. Pilot feasibility studies should be performed when designing clinical trials for genetic disorders. The development and selection of appropriate outcome measures are particularly paramount in the implementation of clinical trials. The selection of inappropriate outcome measures can lead to non‐measurable differences or clinically insignificant findings. In addition, just as age appropriate measures are needed, some instruments may not apply to populations with specific genetic disorders that have significant cognitive and physical impairment, as the measures may not be sensitive enough to identify clinically significant changes. In the last decade, health‐related quality of life measures (HRQOL) have been increasingly included as an outcome measure in clinical trials. While traditional clinical outcomes are important, these newly developed instruments should be considered along with clinical indicators as measures of effect in clinical trials of interventions in genetic disorders. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Prader‐Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by infantile hypotonia, hyperphagia, hypogonadism, growth hormone deficiency, intellectual disability, and severe emotional and behavioral problems. The brain mechanisms that underpin these disturbances are unknown. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enables in vivo investigation of the microstructural integrity of white matter pathways. To date, only one study has used DTI to examine white matter alterations in PWS. However, that study used selected regions of interest, rather than a whole brain analysis. In the present study, we used diffusion tensor and magnetic resonance (T 1‐weighted) imaging to examine microstructural white matter changes in 15 individuals with PWS (17–30 years) and 15 age‐and‐gender‐matched controls. Whole‐brain voxel‐wise statistical analysis of FA was carried out using tract‐based spatial statistics (TBSS). Significantly decreased fractional anisotropy was found localized to the left hemisphere in individuals with PWS within the splenium of the corpus callosum, the internal capsule including the posterior thalamic radiation and the inferior frontal occipital fasciculus (IFOF). Reduced integrity of these white matter pathways in individuals with PWS may relate to orientating attention, emotion recognition, semantic processing, and sensorimotor dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "More than a century ago, Wilhelm Johannsen proposed the terms “genotype” and “phenotype” to study heredity. Much of what we know about genetics and behavior has evolved since then, especially how causality from genotypes can be inferred from observational studies of phenotypes. Unfortunately, there are genotypes that produce complex clinical‐behavioral phenotypes—pleiotropy. In addition, there are often many genotypes that produce the same phenotype, adding a layer of complexity in establishing valid genotype‐phenotype relationships. Unlike the relative simplicity of some phenotypes, behavioral phenotypes, especially those characteristics considered aberrant, are multidimensional and often not easily defined operationally. An alternate approach which attempts to identify less evident manifestations below the level of the phenotype but along the pathway to the prospective genotype—endophenotypes—could prove useful in detecting genes that generate these markers. However, operational definitions of intermediate phenotypes vary, less overt neurobiological expressions for some disorders—autism—have not been found, and studies of endophenotypes associated with schizophrenia have been not been very successful. Another approach, suggested by Sewall Wright, uses path analysis to identify causal variables that produce phenotypes. Innovative models of causality have been developed recently by genetic epidemiologists that incorporate Mendel's second law, and Mendelian randomization has been successful in identifying genotypes associated with some diseases, for example, diabetes and cancer. Regrettably, shortcomings regarding genetic markers associated with intermediate phenotypes have been found, although there are statistical procedures to remedy matters. As in any science, genetic researchers need to consider carefully the models of causality they choose.",

About 90 % of these patients in South East Asia do not have head control and cannot sit, stand, or speak from birth to the time of observation. In 2012, a gene study to treat these patients with intraputamen injection of adeno‐associated virus2‐human AADC showed prominent motor improvement and an increased PDMS‐2 score 12 months after treatment. In addition, systemic gene therapy in a mouse model of AADCD achieved widespread correction of the Ddc gene.

This study evaluated the effects of intervention involving the Playskin Lift™ (Playskin) exoskeletal garment on arm function during object play for children with AMC. Seventeen children with AMC (5 males; 6–35 months at the beginning of the study) were tested in their homes biweekly with and without the Playskin throughout a 1‐month Baseline, 4‐month Intervention, and 1‐month Post‐Intervention. Within sessions ( assistive effects ), children contacted and manipulated objects more while wearing the Playskin; they also showed greater intensity, complexity, and variability of behaviors performed during free play, as well as increased play space and reduced number of compensatory arm and trunk flings to facilitate reaching. Across time ( rehabilitative effects ), children significantly improved their visual–manual coupling as well as their ability to lift objects from a surface and to manipulate objects using one hand; in addition, children exhibited greater multimodality, variability, and intensity of their play behaviors. Current results suggest the Playskin Lift™ may serve as an effective assistive and rehabilitative device to improve play for children with arm movement impairments.",

An appreciation of the clinical presentation of Goltz syndrome is important because physicians rely heavily on recognition of key physical characteristics in order to help make a diagnosis. In this report, we summarize the clinical findings observed when we were afforded the unique opportunity to interview and physically examine 19 patients, the largest group of individuals with Goltz syndrome brought together in one place to date. The findings are intended to characterize the orthopedic phenotypic manifestations of Goltz syndrome. This collection of data revealed that the most common orthopedic findings were syndactyly (68%), ectrodactyly (68%), leg length discrepancy (57%), and reduction defects of long bones (52%). Nail irregularities were present in 89% of the patients seen.",

Coincident with this genetic variation are numerous phenotypic differences between males and females, and individuals with sex chromosome aneuploidy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which sex chromosome constitution impacts phenotypes at the cellular, tissue, and organismal levels remain largely unexplored. Thus, emerges a fundamental question connecting the study of sex differences and sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes: How does sex chromosome constitution influence phenotype? Here, we focus on Turner syndrome (TS), associated with the 45,X karyotype, and its synergies with the study of sex differences. We review findings from evolutionary studies of the sex chromosomes, which identified genes that are most likely to contribute to phenotypes as a result of variation in sex chromosome constitution. We then explore strategies for investigating the direct effects of the sex chromosomes, and the evidence for specific sex chromosome genes impacting phenotypes. In sum, we argue that integrating the study of TS with sex differences offers a mutually beneficial alliance to identify contributions of the sex chromosomes to human development, health, and disease.",

Thus, identifying genetic associations from diverse populations provides an opportunity to better understand the genetic architecture of this heterogeneous disease. It is also necessary to elucidate population differences and to apply the findings in future stratified treatment of the disease, with ethnicity likely a major factor to consider. Indeed, it has shown that there are significant differences between East Asians and European populations in several genetic loci for SLE. Genetic studies on SLE are very active in East Asian countries and there have been close collaborations among scientists in this region.

Altogether, men with KS display problems in neuropsychological functions and mental health but do not appear different from controls on most sleep parameters.

This unique research, educational, and family‐oriented symposium was sponsored by the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital. Goltz syndrome, or Focal Dermal Hypoplasia (FDH), is a highly variable X‐linked dominant disorder with abnormalities in tissues derived from the ectoderm and mesoderm. Classic clinical features include patchy hypoplastic skin, split hand/foot deformities, and ocular manifestations. FDH is caused by PORCN gene mutations. PORCN is involved in the secretion and signaling of Wnt proteins, which play a role in embryonic tissue development. The purpose of the International Research Symposium on Goltz Syndrome was to review the progress that has been made in recent years in research related to this rare disorder and to explore potential future research directions and treatments. This issue of American Journal of Medical Genetics contains the research findings from the evaluations from multiple subspecialties. There is a recommendation for a new diagnostic guideline to aid clinicians in identifying individuals with Focal Dermal Hypoplasia.

    "abstract": "Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) is characterized by a wide variety of structural and functional abnormalities in almost every organ system of the body. CdLS is now known to be caused by mutations that disrupt the function of the cohesin complex or its regulators, and studies of animal models and cell lines tell us that the effect of these mutations is to produce subtle yet pervasive dysregulation of gene expression. With many hundreds of mostly small gene expression changes occurring in every cell type and tissue, identifying the etiology of any particular birth defect is very challenging. Here we focus on limb abnormalities, which are commonly seen in CdLS. In the limb buds of the Nipbl ‐haploinsufficient mouse ( Nipbl +/− mouse), a model for the most common form of CdLS, modest gene expression changes are observed in several candidate pathways whose disruption is known to cause limb abnormalities, yet the limbs of Nipbl +/− mice develop relatively normally. We hypothesized that further impairment of candidate pathways might produce limb defects similar to those seen in CdLS, and performed genetic experiments to test this. Focusing on Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ), Bone morphogenetic protein ( Bmp ), and Hox gene pathways, we show that decreasing Bmp or Hox function (but not Shh function) enhances polydactyly in Nipbl +/− mice, and in some cases produces novel skeletal phenotypes. However, frank limb reductions, as are seen in a subset of individuals with CdLS, do not occur, suggesting that additional signaling and/or gene regulatory pathways are involved in producing such dramatic changes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Epidemiological information on many inherited disorders may be useful to guide health policies for rare diseases, but it is often inadequate, particularly in developing countries. We aimed to calculate the carrier frequencies of rare autosomal recessive Mendelian diseases in a cohort of Brazilian patients using whole exome sequencing (WES). We reviewed the molecular findings of WES from 320 symptomatic patients who had carrier status for recessive diseases. Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, we estimated recessive disease frequencies (q2 ) considering the respective carrier frequencies (2pq) observed in our study. We calculated the sensitivity of carrier screening tests based on lists of genes from five different clinical laboratories that offer them in Brazil. A total of 425 occurrences of 351 rare variants were reported in 278 different genes from 230 patients (71.9%). Almost half (48.8%) were carriers of at least one heterozygous pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant for rare metabolic disorders, while 25.9% of epilepsy, 18.1% of intellectual disabilities, 15.6% of skeletal disorders, 10.9% immune disorders, and 9.1% of hearing loss. We estimated that an average of 67% of the variants would not have been detected by carrier screening panels. The combined frequencies of autosomal recessive diseases were estimated to be 26.39/10,000 (or ~0.26%). This study shows the potential research utility of WES to determine carrier status, which may be a possible strategy to evaluate the clinical and social burden of recessive diseases at the population level and guide the optimization of carrier screening panels.",

Prevalence of generalized joint laxity (hypermobility) in 377 individuals with diagnoses of mental health disorders and/or neurodevelopmental conditions was compared to prevalence recorded in the general population. Autonomic symptom burden was compared between hypermobile and non‐hypermobile patients. Mediation analysis explored relationships between hypermobility, autonomic dysfunction, and anxiety. Patient participants had elevated prevalence of generalized joint laxity (38%) compared to the general population rate of 19% (odds ratio: 2.54 [95% confidence interval: 2.05, 3.16]). Hypermobile participants reported significantly more autonomic symptoms. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance mediated the relationship between hypermobility and diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Patients with mental health disorders and/or neurodevelopmental conditions have high rates of joint hypermobility. Accompanying autonomic dysfunction mediates the association between joint hypermobility and clinical anxiety status. Increased recognition of this association can enhance mechanistic understanding and improve the management of multimorbidity expressed in physical symptoms and mental health difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) can be defined as a multiorgan ciliopathy with a dominant element of chronic airway disease affecting the nose, sinuses, middle ear, and in particular, the lower airways. Although most patients with PCD are diagnosed during preschool years, it is obvious that the chronic lung disease starts its course already from birth. The many faces of the clinical picture change, as does lung function, structural lung damage, the burden of infection, and of treatment throughout life. A markedly severe neutrophil inflammation in the respiratory tract seems pervasive and is only to a minimal extent ameliorated by a treatment strategy, which is predominantly aimed at bacterial infections. An ever-increasing understanding of the different aspects, their interrelationships, and possible different age courses conditioned by the underlying genotype is the focus of much attention. The future is likely to offer personalized medicine in the form of mRNA therapy, but to that end, it is of utmost importance that all patients with PCD be carefully characterized and given a genetic diagnosis. In this narrative review, we have concentrated on lower airways and summarized the current understanding of the chronic airway disease in this motile ciliopathy. In addition, we highlight the challenges, gaps, and opportunities in PCD lung disease research.",

Our objective was to explore the perspectives and predicted practices of physicians (primarily neurologists) who will likely be responsible for the follow-up of infants identified with DMD through NBS. A short survey was developed and distributed to physicians who are responsible for providing care for patients with Duchenne at Certified Duchenne Care Centers across the USA. Twenty-seven physicians responded to statements about benefit and readiness for dystrophinopathy NBS, which care recommendations they would make at initial infant visits, and when they would recommend initiating approved therapies. Most DMD physicians indicated they see benefit in NBS (82%) and believe the DMD care community is ready for NBS in dystrophinopathies (74%). The majority of physicians would recommend multiple interventions, including genetic counseling, maternal carrier testing, referral to early intervention services, screening siblings, discussion of clinical trials, exon skipping therapies, and assessment of social and language development at initial visits. The majority of physicians also indicated they would recommend initiating approved therapies much earlier than the typical age of diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Rare diseases impact approximately 1 in 10 people worldwide, and yet, less than 5% of all rare diseases currently have an approved treatment option available. This is due to many challenges unique to rare diseases, including small, diverse patient populations, the cost of drug development that is not proportionate to the number of patients who could potentially benefit from treatment, and difficulty with clinical trial design to validate new therapeutics. As a result, drug repurposing has become an increasingly promising option for finding treatment options for rare diseases. First described in 2018, Bachmann-Bupp Syndrome (BABS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by gain-of-function variants in the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1) gene and is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and alopecia. Through collaboration and the use of a unique drug repurposing strategy, the first patient identified with BABS was treated with the repurposed drug eflornithine, also known as α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), in just 16 months. Currently, five additional patients with BABS are being treated with DFMO. This model of drug repurposing of an FDA-approved drug for use in another indication can serve as an example of what is possible in the scope of other rare diseases, specifically in other polyaminopathies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the United Kingdom, with a lifetime risk of one in nine in women. Only 5–10% of all cancers is thought to be due to strongly penetrant inherited predisposing genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 . However, other less penetrant genes, including some autosomal recessive genes, are likely to be of etiological importance in other families. This review addresses the current knowledge of breast cancer susceptibility genes and explores the possibilities for future developments. Features of tumor pathology, prognosis, and the scope for targeted treatments in mutation carriers are discussed, and the management of known carriers and those at increased risk for developing breast cancer are evaluated. Genetic testing for cancer susceptibility may become widely available in the future, and has important ethical and management implications. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The pure 3.5 Mb subtelomeric deletion syndrome is very rare but causes a recognizable phenotype characterized by prenatal lymphedema with increased nuchal translucency, pronounced muscular hypotonia in infancy, borderline intelligence, postnatal short stature with delayed bone age due to growth hormone deficiency, and multiple minor anomalies including mildly bell‐shaped chest, minor congenital heart defects, and a distinct facial gestalt. Terminal deletions including the adjacent ∼2 Mb NSD1 ‐locus show a compound phenotype with overlap to Sotos syndrome. Larger terminal deletions including also chromosomal bands 5q35.1 and 5q35.2 cause a more severe phenotype with normal body length, significant congenital heart defect, microcephaly, profound developmental retardation or early death due to respiratory failure. Heart defects in the latter are explained by haploinsufficiency of the NKX2.5 gene at 5q35.1. The deletion breakpoint of the 3.5 Mb subtelomeric microdeletion maps to a low copy repeat which is identical to the distal copy of two highly similar regions flanking the recurrent interstitial NSD1 microdeletion. As meiotic mispairing between these low copy repeats seem to be much more likely than a terminal aberration, these neighborhood may prevent occurrence of the subtelomeric deletion syndrome, which could explain the rareness of the latter. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The application of imaging genetics towards further elucidating neural circuitry associated with the pathophysiology of psychiatric illness is of particular interest given its potential to guide the development and improvement of current therapeutic methods. The identification of genetic variants that contribute to or predict the disruption of specific neural pathways associated with psychopathology may also serve as useful markers of risk demarcating individuals with elevated susceptibility for psychiatric illness and affording early or even preemptive treatment strategies. In the continued development of this technique, recent multimodal neuroimaging strategies and studies examining the effects of multiple genes in concert within large subject populations have shown promise in the development of a more complete understanding of the interrelationships between genes, brain function, behavior and associated risk for psychopathology.",

The methodology is based on our own modifications of the Institute of Healthcare Improvement “Breakthrough Series” and the Northern New England Cystic Fibrosis Consortium. Because of similarities across practices and the availability of existing published practice parameters, the clinical genetics evaluation of the child with developmental delay or intellectual disability was chosen as the topic to be studied. The aim was to improve the rate of etiological diagnosis of those with developmental delays referred to each genetics center by improving the processes of care. Process and outcomes were evaluated. Four of five sites also evaluated the impact of array comparative genomic hybridization (a‐CGH) laboratory testing of such patients. There was significant site‐to‐site variation in the rate of new diagnoses by a‐CGH with the average new diagnosis rate of 11.8% (range 5.4–28.8%). Barriers to implementation of the process and outcome data collection and analysis were significant and related to time pressures, lack of personnel or staff to support this activity, and competing quality improvement initiatives at the institutional home of some genetics centers. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

This article describes two assessment tools—“Defining Genetics Services Framework” and “Genetics Services Outcomes Menu,” created to assist public health professionals, clinicians, family advocates, and researchers to plan, evaluate, and demonstrate the effectiveness of genetics services. The tools were developed by a work group of the Western States Genetics Services Collaborative (WSGSC) consisting of public health genetics and newborn screening professionals, family representatives, a medical geneticist, and genetic counselors from Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The work group created both tools by an iterative process of combining their ideas with findings from a literature and World Wide Web review. The Defining Genetics Services Framework reflects the diversity of work group members. Three over‐lapping areas of genetics services from public health core functions to population screening to clinical genetics services are depicted. The Genetics Services Outcomes Menu lists sample long‐term outcomes of genetics services. Menu outcomes are classified under impact areas of Knowledge and Information; Financing; Screening and Identification; Diagnosis, Treatment, and Management; and Population Health. The WSGSC incorporated aspects of both tools into their Regional Genetics Plan. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

We surveyed 480 clinical geneticists (MDs), genetic counselors (GCs), and genetic nurses randomly selected from their professional associations, and then interviewed a sample of survey respondents. Outcomes included religiosity, coping with distress through spiritual beliefs, and personal value conflicts (PVCs). Two hundred fourteen providers completed the survey out of an estimated 348 eligible (61% response rate). Importance attributed to regular attendance at religious services ranged from 39% (not at all important) to 27% (very important). Reliance on religion and spiritual beliefs as a source of comfort ranged from 48% (never) to 33% (sometimes or often). Religiosity varied by discipline with 58% of nurses thinking regular attendance at religious services was moderately or very important as compared to 47% of GCs and 30% of MDs ( P = 0.006). Ten percent of respondents had difficulty reconciling their own faith with being a genetics professional, 14% felt the need to hide their own faith from their colleagues or patients, 7% thought their professional stance was not consistent with their personal values, and 4% felt ostracized by the genetics community because of their personal beliefs. The experience of such PVCs was positively correlated with religiosity (r = 0.35; P &lt; 0.0001). GCs were more likely to experience PVCs than MDs or nurses ( P = 0.013). Data from the interviews (N = 54) support these findings. A significant minority of genetic service providers are religiously observant and rely on their religious values to cope with distress. These individuals often experience difficulty reconciling their religious beliefs with the expectations of their profession, and sharing their beliefs with their colleagues and patients. Efforts should be made to prevent or reduce the secrecy surrounding personal faith and religion among genetics professionals. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Based on the evolutionary history of the sex chromosomes, and the pattern of dosage balancing among sex chromosomal and autosomal genes in functional gene networks, it is possible to prioritize types of X genes for study as potential causes of features of TS. For example, X‐Y gene pairs are among the most interesting because of the convergent effects of X and Y genes that both are likely to prevent the effects of TS in XX and XY individuals. Many of the high‐priority genes are shared by mouse and human X chromosomes, but are easier to study in genetically tractable mouse models. Several mouse models, used primarily for the study of sex differences in physiology and disease, also produce XO mice that can be investigated to understand the effects of X monosomy. Using these models will lead to the identification of specific X genes that make a difference when present in one or two copies. These studies will help to achieve a better appreciation of the contribution of these specific X genes to the syndromic features of TS.",

This study describes the relationship between AMC‐related surgically‐managed joints in childhood and adulthood, and QOL as adults. Participants ( n = 83) from 14 countries completed an online questionnaire followed by a telephone/Skype interview as adults. Data points collected regarding total number of surgeries, affected joints, country of origin, sex, age, and SF‐36's Physical Capacity Score (PCS) for QOL were analyzed using a beta regression model to explore which factors may potentially influence adult QOL. The average number of surgeries per participant was 9.8, with at least 50% performed during childhood. 78, 45, and 31% of participants had foot, knee, and hip surgeries, respectively. The model demonstrated that knee and/or shoulder surgeries were more likely to have a negative correlation with PCS; elbow surgery, however, showed a positive correlation, as elbow function may impact independent function. However, future expansion of this data set to a longitudinal registry would provide better ongoing surgery‐specific data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, numerous overgrowth syndromes have been found to be caused by pathogenic DNA sequence variants in “epigenes,” genes that encode proteins that function in epigenetic regulation. Epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation (DNAm), histone modifications and chromatin conformation, have emerged as a vital genome‐wide regulatory mechanism that modulate the transcriptome temporally and spatially to drive normal developmental and cellular processes. Evidence suggests that epigenetic marks are layered and engage in crosstalk, in that disruptions of any one component of the epigenetic machinery impact the others. This interdependence of epigenetic marks underpins the recent identification of gene‐specific DNAm signatures for a variety of disorders caused by pathogenic variants in epigenes. Here, we discuss the power of DNAm signatures with respect to furthering our understanding of disease pathophysiology, enhancing the efficacy of molecular diagnostics and identifying new targets for therapeutics of overgrowth syndromes. These findings highlight the promise of the field of epigenomics to provide unprecedented insights into disease mechanisms generating a host of opportunities to advance precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a shortage of genetics providers worldwide and access is limited to large academic centers. Telemedicine programs can facilitate access to genetic services to patients living in remote locations. The goal of this study was to improve access to genetic services in the Dominican Republic by creating a partnership model between a pediatrician and geneticist. This approach has been used within the United States but not in the setting of two different countries, healthcare system, and cultures. Patients were referred to the Centro de Obstetricia y Ginecologia program if a syndromic or genetic etiology was suspected by their local provider. Pediatrician first evaluated all patients prior to telemedicine appointment to review family and medical history. All genetic visits were scheduled within 2 weeks of referral in collaboration with telehealth program at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. A total of 66 individuals were evaluated during a period of 5 years. Fifty‐seven individuals underwent genetic studies, and a molecular diagnosis was made in 39 individuals. Exome sequencing was the most common first line test when differential diagnosis was broad ( n = 40). The most common inheritance was autosomal recessive in 15 individuals, followed by 13 individuals with autosomal dominant disorders, 7 individuals X‐linked disorders, and 4 individuals with chromosomal abnormalities. This study provides data to support utility of geneticist and pediatrician partnership to provide outreach telemedicine diagnostics and management services for rare diseases in an international setting.",

Established in 2003, BCFP is a voluntary and cooperative network aiming to investigate the health care of people with these diseases and other craniofacial anomalies. The initiatives and research results are presented in four sections: (a) a comprehensive report of the Brazilian public health system in craniofacial genetics; (b) multicentric studies developed on OFC and 22q11.2 DS; (c) education strategies focused on addressing these conditions for both population and health‐care professionals; and (d) the nosology through the Brazilian Database on Craniofacial Anomalies (BDCA). Since 2006, BDCA uses a standardized method with detailed clinical data collection, which allows for conducting studies on nosology, genotype–phenotype correlations, and natural history; data can also contribute to public policies. Currently, the BDCA stores data on 1,724 individuals, including 1,351 (78.36%) who were primarily admitted due to OFC and 373 (21.63%) with clinical suspicion of 22q11.2 DS. Chromosomal abnormalities/genomic imbalances were represented by 92/213 (43.19%) individuals with syndromic OFC, including 43 with 22q11.2 DS, which indicates the need for chromosomal microarray analysis in this group. The nosologic diversity reinforces that monitoring clinical is the best strategy for etiological investigation. BCFP's methodology has introduced the possibility of increasing scientific knowledge and genetic diagnosis of OFC and 22q11.2 DS to in turn improve health care and policies for this group of diseases.",

    "abstract": "The developing brain is highly sensitive to the organizing effects of steroids of gonadal origin in a process referred to as sexual differentiation. Early hormone effects prime the brain for adult sensitivity to the appropriate hormonal milieu, maximizing reproductive fitness via coordinated physiology and behavior. Animal models, in particular rodents, have provided insight into general principles and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of brain differentiation. Cellular endpoints influenced by steroids in the developing brain include neurogenesis, migration, apoptosis, dendritic growth, and synaptic patterning. Important roles for prostaglandins, endocanabinoids, and epigenetics are among the many cellular mediators of hormonal organization. Transference of general principles of brain sexual differentiation to humans relies on observations of individuals with genetic anomalies that either increase or decrease hormone exposure and sensitivity. The physiology and behavior of individuals with XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) has not been considered in the context of sexual differentiation of the brain, most likely due to the delay in diagnoses and highly variable presentation. The behavioral phenotype and impairments in the domains of speech and language that are characteristic of individuals with XXY is consistent with the reduced androgen production associated with the syndrome. Hormone replacement appears effective in restoring some deficits and impact may be further improved by increased understanding of the hormonally mediated sexual differentiation of the brain.",

It is unknown whether haploinsufficiency of any of these genes is responsible for the clinical features of our patient. We reviewed, the clinical phenotype of a previously published 7q31.3 deletion patient and 18 additional patients with overlapping 7q31 deletions listed in the DECIPHER database.

The aim of the study was the identification of prognostic features, ascertainable precociously in the patient's life, of a better intellectual outcome and the development of a new prognostic index of severity of intellectual disability in CdLS patients. In 66 italian CdLS patients aged 8 years or more, we evaluated the association of the degree of intellectual disability with various clinical parameters ascertainable before 6 months of life and with the molecular data by the application of cumulative regression logistic model. Based on these results and on the previously known genotype‐phenotype correlations, we selected seven parameters to be used in a multivariate cumulative regression logistic model to develop a prognostic index of severity of intellectual disability. The probability of a mild ID increases with the reducing final score less than two, the probability of a severe ID increases with the increasing final score more than three. This prognostic index allows to define, precociously in the life of a baby, the probability of a better or worse intellectual outcome in CdLS patients. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Stargardt disease 1 (STGD1) is the most prevalent retinal dystrophy caused by pathogenic biallelic ABCA4 variants. Forty-two unrelated patients mostly originating from Western China were recruited. Comprehensive ophthalmological examinations, including visual acuity measurements (subjective function), fundus autofluorescence (retinal imaging), and full-field electroretinography (objective function), were performed. Next-generation sequencing (target/whole exome) and direct sequencing were conducted. Genotype grouping was performed based on the presence of deleterious variants. The median age of onset/age was 10.0 (5-52)/29.5 (12-72) years, and the median visual acuity in the right/left eye was 1.30 (0.15-2.28)/1.30 (0.15-2.28) in the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution unit. Ten patients (10/38, 27.0%) showed confined macular dysfunction, and 27 (27/37, 73.7%) had generalized retinal dysfunction. Fifty-eight pathogenic/likely pathogenic ABCA4 variants, including 14 novel variants, were identified. Eight patients (8/35, 22.8%) harbored multiple deleterious variants, and 17 (17/35, 48.6%) had a single deleterious variant. Significant associations were revealed between subjective functional, retinal imaging, and objective functional groups, identifying a significant genotype-phenotype association. This study illustrates a large phenotypic/genotypic spectrum in a large well-characterized STGD1 cohort. A distinct genetic background of the Chinese population from the Caucasian population was identified; meanwhile, a genotype-phenotype association was similarly represented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract GM2 gangliosidosis, Tay‐Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. This accumulation is due to deficiency in the activity of the β‐hexosaminidases Hex‐A or Hex‐B, which are dimeric hydrolases formed by αβ or ββ subunits, respectively. These disorders show similar clinical manifestations that range from mild systemic symptoms to neurological damage and premature death. There is still no effective therapy for GM2 gangliosidoses, but some therapeutic alternatives, as enzyme replacement therapy, have being evaluated. Previously, we reported the production of active human recombinant β‐hexosaminidases (rhHex‐A and rhHex‐B) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris . In this study, we evaluated in vitro the cellular uptake, intracellular delivery to lysosome, and reduction of stored substrates. Both enzymes were taken‐up via endocytic pathway mediated by mannose and mannose‐6‐phosphate receptors and delivered to lysosomes. Noteworthy, rhHex‐A diminished the levels of stored lipids and lysosome mass in fibroblasts from Tay‐Sachs patients. Overall, these results confirm the potential of P. pastoris as host to produce recombinant β‐hexosaminidases intended to be used in the treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis.",

It included 54 individuals who were evaluated by a clinical geneticist. Copy number variants (CNVs) in the 22q11.2 region were investigated by multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for all individuals. The CMA was performed only for individuals with additional major features. MLPA revealed pathogenic CNVs at the 22q11 region in 3/54 (5.6%) individuals. CMA revealed pathogenic CNVs in 4/17 (23.5%) individuals, including the three CNVs at the 22q11 region also detected by MLPA, and CNVs classified as variants of unknown significance (VOUS) in 4/17 (23.5%) individuals. Pathogenic alterations were found at the 2p12, 5p15, 13q13, and 22q11 regions. VOUS were found at 3q29, 5q22.2, 5q22.1, and 9p22 regions. All individuals with pathogenic alterations presented additional major features, including congenital heart disease (CHD). The literature review revealed pathogenic CNVs in 17/193 (8.8%) individuals and most of them also presented additional major features, such as CHD, renal anomalies, or developmental delay. In conclusion, CNVs should be investigated in patients with CFM and additional major features.",

In this article, we review the state of clinical and research SD resources available in Latin America, including three specific countries (Brazil, Argentina, and Chile), that have established multidisciplinary clinics for the care of these patients. From the epidemiological point of view, the SD prevalence of 3.2 per 10,000 births from nine South American countries included in the ECLAMC network represents the most accurate estimate not just in Latin America, but worldwide. In Brazil, there are currently five groups focused on SD. The data from one of these groups including the website www.ocd.med.br , created to assist in the diagnosis of SD, are highlighted showing that telemedicine for this purpose represents a good strategy for the region. The experience of more than 30 years of the SD multidisciplinary clinic in an Argentinian Hospital is presented, evidencing a solid experience mainly in the follow‐up of the most frequent SD, especially those belonging the FGFR3 group and OI. In Chile, a group with 20 years of experience presents its work with geneticists and pediatricians, focusing on diagnostic purposes and clinical management. Altogether, although SD health‐care and research activities in Latin America are in their early stages, the experience in these three countries seems promising and stimulating for the region as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Colombia has a high prevalence of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IVA. Nevertheless, data regarding the mutation spectrum for MPS IVA in this population have not been completely characterized. Forty-seven families and 53 patients from seven different Colombian regions were tested for MPS IVA mutations. We compared the sequences with the N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) reference sequence NM_000512.4, and gene variants were reported. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using SWISS-MODEL. The mutant proteins were generated by homology from the wild-type GALNS 4FDJ template obtained from the PDB database, and visualization was performed using Swiss-PDBViewer and UCSF Chimera. The predictive analysis was run using different bioinformatic tools, and the deleterious annotation of genetic variants was performed using a neural network. We found that 79% and 21% of the cohort was homozygous and compound heterozygous, respectively. The most frequent mutation observed was p.Gly301Cys (78.3% of alleles), followed by p.Arg386Cys (10.4% of alleles). A novel mutation (p.Phe72Ile) was described and classified in silico as a pathogenic variant. This study reveals the mutation spectrum of MPS IVA in Colombia. The high prevalence of the p.Gly301Cys mutation suggests a founder effect of this variant in the Colombian population that causes diseases in the Andean region (via migration). These data can facilitate genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and the design of therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Newborn screening (NBS) is a successful public health initiative that effectively identifies pre‐symptomatic neonates so that treatment can be initiated before the onset of irreversible morbidity and mortality. Legislation passed in 2008 has supported a system of state screening programs, educational resources, and an evidence‐based review process to add conditions to a recommended universal newborn screening panel (RUSP). The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), NIH, has promoted NBS research to advance legislative goals by supporting research that will uncover fundamental mechanisms of disease, develop treatments for NBS disorders, and promote pilot studies to test implementation of new conditions. NICHD's partnerships with other federal agencies have contributed to activities that support nominations of new conditions to the RUSP. The NIH's Newborn Sequencing In Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) initiative funded research projects that considered how genomic sequencing could be integrated into NBS and its ethical ramifications. Recently, the workshop, “Gene Targeted Therapies: Early Diagnosis and Equitable Delivery,” has explored the possibility of expanding NBS to include genetic diagnosis and precision, gene‐based therapies. Although hurdles remain to realize such a vision, broad engagement of multiple stakeholders is essential to advance genomic medicine within NBS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Development of genetic tests for rare genetic diseases has traditionally focused on individual diseases. Similarly, development of new therapies occurred one disease at a time. With &gt;10,000 rare genetic diseases, this approach is not feasible. Diagnosis of genetic disorders has already transcended old paradigms as whole exome and genome sequencing have allowed expedient interrogation of all relevant genes in a single test. The growth of newborn screening has allowed identification of diseases in presymptomatic babies. Similarly, the ability to develop therapies is rapidly expanding due to technologies that leverage platform technology that address multiple diseases. However, movement from the basic science laboratory to clinical trials is still hampered by a regulatory system rooted in traditional trial design, requiring a fresh assessment of safe ways to obtain approval for new drugs. Ultimately, the number of nucleic acid‐based therapies will challenge the ability of clinics focused on rare diseases to deliver them safely with appropriate evaluation and long‐term follow‐up. This manuscript summarizes discussions arising from a recent National Institutes of Health conference on nucleic acid therapy, with a focus on scaling technologies for diagnosis of rare disorders and provision of therapies across the age and disease spectrum.",

While certain findings, including relative or absolute macrocephaly, are typical for most RASopathies, other findings are more common in certain conditions, with rare low‐grade gliomas in Noonan syndrome (NS); Chiari 1 malformation and tethered cord in Costello syndrome (CS); and variable structural anomalies including heterotopia and hydrocephalus in cardio‐facio‐cutaneous syndrome (CFC). We performed a literature review and present aggregate data on the common and uncommon CNS manifestations in individuals with RASopathies. A gene‐based approach to defining risk for specific abnormalities may be considered. However, limited information on the CNS findings of rare RASopathies, such as autosomal recessive LZTR1 ‐related NS or PPP1CB ‐related NS with loose anagen hair (NSLH), is currently available. Thus, consideration of the RASopathies as a group of distinct syndromic conditions with shared underlying causes and overlapping clinical presentations remains relevant, and individuals with a RASopathy are at risk for many findings seen in these conditions.",

Osteopenia and osteoporosis are reported in many of the RASopathies suggesting a shared pathogenesis. Even though osteopenia and osteoporosis are often detected and fractures have been reported, the clinical impact of bone mineralization defects on the skeleton of the various syndromes is poorly understood. Further knowledge of the role of the Ras/MAPK pathway on the bone cellular function, and more detailed musculoskeletal phenotyping will be critical in helping to develop therapies to improve bone health in the RASopathies.",

This technology, also called next‐generation phenotyping (NGP), has progressed significantly over the last decade. This review paper will introduce three key NGP approaches. In 2014, Ferry et al. first presented Clinical Face Phenotype Space (CFPS) trained on eight syndromes. After 5 years, Gurovich et al. proposed DeepGestalt, a deep convolutional neural network trained on more than 21,000 patient images with 216 disorders. It was considered a state‐of‐the‐art disorder classification framework. In 2022, Hsieh et al. developed GestaltMatcher to support the ultra‐rare and novel disorders not supported in DeepGestalt. It further enabled the analysis of facial similarity presented in a given cohort or multiple disorders. Moreover, this article will present the usage of NGP for variant prioritization and facial gestalt delineation. Although NGP approaches have proven their capability in assisting the diagnosis of many disorders, many limitations remain. This article will introduce two future directions to address two main limitations: enabling the global collaboration for a medical imaging database that fulfills the FAIR principles and synthesizing patient images to protect patient privacy. In the end, with more and more NGP approaches emerging, we envision that the NGP technology can assist clinicians and researchers in diagnosing patients and analyzing disorders in multiple directions in the near future.",

Features may include hypoplastic nails, slow growth, characteristic facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Most reported cases are due to ARID1B loss of function variants. We report a boy with developmental delay, feeding difficulties, aspiration, recurrent respiratory infections, slow growth, and hypotonia without a clinical diagnosis, where a previously unreported ARID1B missense variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance. The pathogenicity of this variant was refined through combined methodologies including genome‐wide methylation signature analysis (EpiSign), Machine Learning (ML) facial phenotyping, and LIRICAL. Trio exome sequencing and EpiSign were performed. ML facial phenotyping compared facial images using FaceMatch and GestaltMatcher to syndrome‐specific libraries to prioritize the trio exome bioinformatic pipeline gene list output. Phenotype‐driven variant prioritization was performed with LIRICAL. A de novo heterozygous missense variant, ARID1B p.(Tyr1268His), was reported as a variant of uncertain significance. The ACMG classification was refined to likely pathogenic by a supportive methylation signature, ML facial phenotyping, and prioritization through LIRICAL. The ARID1B genotype–phenotype has been expanded through an extended analysis of missense variation through genome‐wide methylation signatures, ML facial phenotyping, and likelihood‐ratio gene prioritization.",

Pediatric TS patients underwent studies of salivary cortisol (SC) and cortisone (SCn), body composition, continuous glucose monitoring, vascular function, and ambulatory blood pressure (BP). Biochemical indicators of cardiovascular risk were also measured. Data were compared to matched healthy controls (HCs) or interpreted according to reference populations. Ten patients, aged 14.1 ± 2.3 years participated. Mean SC was higher in girls with TS, although the early morning measurement was lower resulting in a flatter diurnal profile. Body mass index was &gt; 1.0 SDS in five and muscle‐to‐fat ratio was low (&lt; 0.8) in six participants. Four had proatherogenic lipid profiles and six had raised clotting and/or inflammatory markers. Mean glucose concentration was higher in TS than in HCs (109.8 vs. 102.6 mg/dL, p = 0.003). Loss of nocturnal dipping in BP was universal, and hypertension was present in three patients. TS participants had an adverse cardiovascular profile. The same cohort also exhibited increased cortisol exposure and the clinical significance of these dual findings warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Turner Syndrome (TS) is a sex chromosomal disorder associated with karyotype heterogeneity. Although TS can be associated with severe prenatal findings, most often linked to the 45, X karyotype, the majority of TS fetuses have no overt phenotype, resulting in delayed diagnosis and management. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of non-invasive prenatal testing by cell-free DNA (cfNIPT) in detecting TS fetuses with different TS karyotype variants and to examine the phenotypic variations and clinical outcomes.Data on pregnancies with confirmed or suspected TS from 2000 to 2024 were collected from specialists in fetal ultrasound in Germany. In addition, a small number of Danish cases with 45, X mosaicism in the placenta was included. Data were collected regarding cfNIPT results, karyotypes, prenatal ultrasound findings, and pregnancy outcomes.Of the 114 cases included, 100 (87.7%) had a high-risk cfNIPT result for monosomy X, 53 (46.5%) were true positives (TP), and 47 (41.2%) were false positives (FP). Fourteen (12.3%) were false negatives (FN). No differences in congenital malformation or nuchal translucency were seen between TP and FN. Data on karyotype were available for 67 cases. Fourty (59.7%) had a 45, X karyotype, 16 (23.9%) 45, X mosaicism, and 11 (16.4%) had a structural variant. The 45, X karyotype was associated with a higher prevalence of congenital malformation and increased nuchal translucency (ps ≤ 0.001). The live birth rate was higher in cases with 45, X mosaicism or structural variants compared to cases with a 45, X karyotype (ps ≤ 0.03). Postnatal phenotypes were often mild.cfNIPT represents a valuable tool for the early identification of fetuses with TS karyotype variants, enabling timely intervention and targeted management. However, the high false-positive rate underscores the need for careful counseling.",

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the medical databases PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. The selection of studies was guided by specific eligibility criteria. Extracted data was arranged in a review matrix, and study quality was assessed using a methodological quality score (MQS). Twenty‐seven studies were selected for review, including 21 retrospective studies, five case reports, and one prospective study. The mean MQS across studies was 9.7 points (low to moderate). Across the included studies, nine categories of factors were investigated in association with parental decisions, including five pregnancy‐related categories (ultrasound‐detected abnormalities, karyotype, gestational age at diagnosis, time period of diagnosis, and prenatal counseling) and four categories related to expectant parents (age, reproductive history, expectations/concerns about the child's prognosis, and socio‐demographic characteristics). Among these, ultrasound‐detected abnormalities, karyotype, and counseling emerged as key factors influencing parental decisions. Parental decisions following a PND of TS are influenced by a complex interplay of medical, psychological, and socio‐cultural factors. Addressing these determinants through patient‐centered, non‐directive counseling and equitable access to genetic expertise can support informed decision making.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT It is evident that Turner syndrome (TS) impacts almost all developmental stages of the fetal heart with congenital heart disease (CHD) being seen in 23%–50% of individuals. Although the spectrum of CHDs in TS is well‐established, with left‐sided lesions predominating, the influence of specific karyotypes on the prevalence and types of CHDs remains incompletely understood. The primary objective of this systematic review/meta‐analysis was to quantitatively synthesize the existing evidence on the association between specific karyotypes in TS and the risk of various CHDs. A systematic literature search was conducted through December 2023 to identify studies reporting the prevalence of CHDs in relation to TS karyotype. The quality of the individual studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools for systematic reviews. The overall estimates were pooled using both fixed‐ and random‐effects models. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis were performed. Twenty‐five studies were included in the analysis. TS individuals with a 45,X karyotype showed a significantly higher likelihood of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (pooled OR, 3.14 [95% CI: 2.49–3.94]), aortic coarctation (CoA) (pooled OR, 4.16 [95% CI: 2.74–6.31]), and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) (pooled OR, 4.86 [2.31–10.2]) compared with TS individuals with a non‐45,X karyotype. In addition, TS individuals with a 45,X karyotype also showed a significantly higher likelihood of BAV (pooled OR, 2.72 [95% CI: 1.62–4.56]) when compared with TS individuals with 45,X/46,XX mosaicism. TS individuals with a 45,X karyotype showed a significantly higher risk of BAV (pooled OR, 2.13 [95% CI: 1.42–3.21]) and CoA (pooled OR, 4.52 [95% CI: 1.58–13.0]) when compared with TS individuals with an isochromosome Xq. A significantly higher likelihood of BAV was also found in 45,X compared to other karyotypes (e.g., 45,X/46,XY and TS karyotypes with ring X chromosome). Some heterogeneity was evident, but publication was low. This meta‐analysis confirms a strong association between the 45,X karyotype and increased prevalence of BAV, CoA, and PAPVR in TS. While 45,X/46,XX mosaicism and karyotypes with an isochromosome Xq mitigate risk, the findings emphasize the need for large‐scale studies to refine risk assessment and management strategies.",

Parents of children with Myhre syndrome and adults themselves face unique challenges, stresses, and fears associated with this diagnosis. Reflective writing in the form of journaling can provide psychosocial support and help individuals cope with this diagnosis. Adult patients and parents whose children were evaluated at the Massachusetts General Hospital Myhre Syndrome Clinic were invited to participate in a three-month journaling intervention. Participation in the study required the completion of a series of surveys prior to starting and upon completion of the study. Data from these surveys were analyzed to assess for change in mental well-being. Eleven individuals participated, six of whom completed the three-month journaling intervention and post-journaling surveys. Three participants indicated that journaling had an impact on their mental well-being, and of these, two planned to continue journaling. However, there was no statistically significant difference in mental well-being scores pre- and post-journaling intervention. The very small size of the study limits interpretation, but we think it is reasonable to suggest that expressive writing through journaling may be a coping mechanism and means of improving well-being for some individuals in the Myhre syndrome community.",

Imatinib has been well tolerated without apparent side effects. Within weeks to months after initiating imatinib, he grew thick curly hair, and the texture of his skin and joint stiffness had marked improvement. Over the past 4 years, he has not developed acroosteolysis and continues to have normal hair growth. Surveillance MRA has not identified aneurysms or vessel ectasia. Height decreased from 90th to 75th percentile. He has mild developmental delays and is awaiting formal evaluation for autism spectrum disorder.

Individuals with NF1 can be significantly impacted by NF1‐related complications, and targeted therapies are emerging. Currently, MEK inhibitors selumetinib and mirdametinib are the only FDA‐approved targeted therapies for NF1‐related symptomatic or progressive, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. Several additional MEK inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of plexiform neurofibromas. Additional therapies are currently under investigation for the treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, low‐grade gliomas, skeletal manifestations, cutaneous neurofibromas, and other NF1‐related complications.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The effect of estrogen deficiency on bone health in Turner syndrome (TS) may be a concern even before adulthood. Previous guidelines have discussed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in children with TS. However, some practical issues related to puberty induction in TS require clarification, such as how to implement HRT to achieve adequate bone health. It is generally assumed that earlier initiation of HRT will result in better bone health in young adults with TS and estrogen deficiency. The present study reviews pubertal development, bone health, and current pubertal induction therapies in TS, with a particular focus on patients without endogenous estrogen production. Current guidelines recommend using transdermal estradiol patches starting at the age of 11–12 years if necessary to mimic the gradual increase in circulating, physiological estradiol. Theoretically, earlier therapy combined with forecasting estrogen deficiency on the basis of increased FSH may allow a closer approximation to endogenous estradiol secretion in patients with TS without spontaneous puberty. This approach may lead to better long‐term outcomes, such as the acquisition of normal bone mineral density. Further research is needed to assess how the achievement of normal bone density and bone quality relates to the timing of HRT in children and young adults with TS. The resulting improvements in transdermal estradiol therapy may help patients with TS achieve optimal bone health.",

These nonmedical workers represent a kind of extended family, which can strongly influence the decisions made and services received by the people they serve. By contrast, most individuals with mental retardation do not have extraordinary medical needs, and healthcare professionals play only a minor role in their human services family. There are deeply rooted historical differences between the medical model of mental retardation with which genetics professionals are familiar and the philosophies embraced by nonmedical workers who dominate the mental retardation field. These contrasts have an important impact on the genetic diagnostic process, as well as a more global effect on mental retardation research. Without the full participation of teachers, therapists, psychologists, and others outside the medical setting, many practical applications of genetic research can neither be implemented nor expanded upon, and an important opportunity for cross‐fertilization is lost. It is in the interest of the genetics community to take advantage of recent overtures by the mental retardation field to forge new alliances and broaden its perspectives on intellectual disability. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Successful completion of the Human Genome Project provides greater opportunity to incorporate the study of genetic factors into public health research. Integration of DNA specimen collection into epidemiological studies of complex disorders, such as birth defects, is necessary to identify genetic risk factors that affect susceptibility to potentially modifiable environmental risk factors, but collection of DNA samples often heightens concerns about ethical issues. Some of these issues include ensuring informed consent in an ongoing study as new genetic risk factors and novel genetic technologies for study continue to be identified, achieving a balance between improving participation using incentives and avoiding coercion, ensuring confidentiality of individual genetic data, and considering when and how to report research results to study participants. We present a discussion of ethical issues addressed by investigators of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a multisite, population-based, case-control study of risk factors for birth defects, which has incorporated the study of genetic risk factors. Study participants include infants and young children whose parents consent on their behalf, increasing the complexity of the ethical issues. Discussion of these issues and the methods employed to ensure protection of human subjects might be helpful to other investigators working to integrate genetics into large epidemiological studies.",

This is an exploratory qualitative study designed to elicit care providers' descriptions of experiences with religion and genetics in clinical or pastoral interactions. Thirteen focus groups were conducted with members of the caring professions: physicians, nurses, and genetics counselors (clinicians), ministers and chaplains (clergy). Preliminary analysis of qualitative data is presented here. Preliminary analysis highlights four positions in professional perceptions of the relationship between science and faith. Further, differences among professional perceptions appear to influence perceptions of needed or available resources for interactions with religion and genetics. Clinicians' and clergy's perceptions of how religion and genetics relate are not defined solely by professional affiliation.

These deeper questions have commonly been seen as the purview of religion and spirituality. This essay explores how religion and spirituality are understood in the current US context and defined in the scholarly literature over the past 100 years. It is argued that a pragmatic, functional approach to religion and spirituality is important to understanding how patients respond to genetic diagnoses and participate in genetic therapies. A pragmatic, functional approach requires broadening the inquiry to include anything that provides a framework of transcendent meaning for the fundamental existential questions of human life. This approach also entails suspending questions about the truth claims of any particular religious/spiritual belief or practice. Three implications of adopting this broad working definition will be presented. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Considerable literature is available on managing the contractures during an affected child's development but little information is available to those managing these ongoing issues in adulthood. Due to the heterogeneity etiological factors and presentation of AMC, and the small sample sizes of previous studies, it has been difficult to generalize results to the adult population. This current study presents the several steps taken to create an international AMC database for adults to populate with their own data over time. The methods included a scoping review of the literature for valid and reliable outcome measures used for AMC, a Delphi methodology to create the database with a team of clinicians, researchers and patients, a Beta testing of the database, and a final launch of the Adult AMC Registry. This registry includes 48 nonstandardized questions and 12 standardized questionnaires. It takes 35–45 min for a participant to complete. A shorter version will be created for participants to complete for years 2 and 3, followed by this longer version every 4 years. The protocol for referring English‐speaking patients and access to the registry is provided. Data will be reviewed every year to ensure quality. The registry will be maintained for a minimum of 10 years and data will be comprehensively analyzed every 5 years. Our goal is to have 500 adults with AMC from around the world as participants.",

Because of the rarity of the condition, its diagnostic features and natural course are not well known. We describe clinical and radiographic findings in six patients (five of which with homozygous mutations in the NKX3‐2 gene) and highlight the unusual and severe changes in the cervical spine and the neurologic complications. In individuals with SMMD, the trunk and the neck are short, while the limbs, fingers and toes are disproportionately long. Radiographs show a severe ossification delay of the vertebral bodies with sagittal and coronal clefts, missing ossification of the pubic bones, large round “balloon‐like” epiphyses of the long bones, and presence of multiple pseudoepiphyses at all metacarpals and phalanges. Reduced or absent ossification of the cervical vertebrae leads to cervical instability with anterior or posterior kinking of the cervical spine (swan neck‐like deformity, kyknodysostosis ). As a result of the cervical spine instability or deformation, five of six patients in our series suffered cervical cord injury that manifested clinically as limb spasticity. Although the number of individuals observed is small, the high incidence of cervical spine deformation in SMMD is unique among skeletal dysplasias. Early diagnosis of SMMD by recognition of the radiographic pattern might prevent of the neurologic complications via prophylactic cervical spine stabilization. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

These include traditional invasive procedures, screening with maternal serum analytes and fetal ultrasound, and most recently cell‐free fetal DNA. Since its introduction in the late 1960s, prenatal genetic diagnosis has evolved greatly. Serendipitious detection of 47,XXY was not infrequent when prenatal genetic diagnosis routinely involved testing by the invasive procedures CVS and amniocentesis. In 2013 this is much less common and relatively few pregnancies in the U.S. and Europe are tested without prior screening protocols, traditionally maternal serum analyte and fetal ultrasound (NT). These protocols are not designed to identify 47,XXY or other X‐chromosome aneuploides and with screening by analysis of cell‐free DNA in maternal blood, this situation may or may not be altered. Increased numbers of cases could be detected if intake increases and vendors offer information on 47,XXY. A further consideration is that ability of array CGH to detect microdeletions or microduplications below resolution of a karyotype could make return to direct testing using an invasive procedure attractive. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Evaluation by a dysmorphologist of babies prenatally exposed to a particular agent has played an incredibly important role in these studies. Most of the known human teratogens have been identified by the astute clinician approach which involves the observation, documentation, and delineation of individual cases who display a novel phenotype after a particularly rare prenatal exposure. Prospective cohort studies focused on the evaluation of prenatally exposed children who have been ascertained prospectively prior to the known outcome of pregnancy and evaluated by a dysmorphologist for patterns of minor and major malformations have been equally effective. Although most human teratogens have been identified using one of these two methods, both have limitations. The purpose of this study is to set forth the extent to which a careful physical examination performed by a dysmorphologist trained in the identification of minor structural defects in development has added to our knowledge of human teratology and has been instrumental in the identification of new human teratogens. Although dysmorphologists have had a profound impact on our understanding of human teratogens. It is important to recognize that the two approaches outlined in this study must be complemented by other methodologies, such as case-control studies, that more appropriately address risks for major malformations in order to gain the full picture necessary to effectively counsel women about safety of drugs during pregnancy.",

The goals of this study were to assess the epidemiologic characteristics of acardia from birth defect registries in the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (Clearinghouse), and compare these findings to current literature. The study included 17 surveillance programs of the Clearinghouse representing 23 countries from North and South America, Europe, China, and Australia. Anonymized individual records with clinical and demographic data were reviewed centrally by clinical geneticists. A literature search was performed. A total of 164 cases of acardia were reported from an underlying cohort of 21.2 million births. Of these, 23% were elective pregnancy terminations. Rates did not vary significantly by maternal age. For many cases, information on pregnancy exposures and genetic testing was missing. However, these limited data did not suggest high rates of chronic illnesses (diabetes, seizure disorders) or lifestyle factors such as smoking. One case had trisomy 13. Major malformations were reported in 2.4% of co‐twins. With some basic assumptions, the total prevalence of acardia was estimated at 1 in 50,000–70,000 births, and 1 in 200–280 monozygotic twins. In summary, acardia is a dramatic, probably underreported, and incompletely understood malformation. Studies on its epidemiology and etiology are challenging and still rare. An international collaboration of epidemiologists, clinicians, and geneticists is necessary to understand the etiology, pathogenesis, and occurrence of this severe malformation complex. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Disorders/Differences of Sex Development (DSD), as defined by the 2006 Consensus Statement, are \"congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical.\" They represent a spectrum of chronic medical conditions collectively affecting about 1% of the population and are associated with increased risk of infertility, cancer, and psychosocial distress. Clinical management in DSD is subject to multiple controversies about gender assignment, the timing and appropriateness of genital surgery and the approach to disclosure. There is dissent within and between stakeholders (healthcare providers, advocacy groups, families) regarding what constitutes optimal care. This special issue investigates the progress made as well as the uncertainties remaining a decade after the consensus statement and the gaps to be filled by future research and improved clinical practice. It discusses the increasing intricacy of genetic variant interpretation in the era of next-generation sequencing and the associated complexity of phenotypic variability. The issue tackles ethical dilemmas and the complicated decision-making process of assignment of sex of rearing at birth in cases of 5-alpha reductase type 2 deficiency, surveys delivery of clinical services in the United States, discusses challenges of interdisciplinary care and of educating patients and parents about DSD,and reviews the factors predisposing to gonadal tumor and their consequences on clinical management.",

    "abstract": "Comorbidity of holoprosencephaly (HPE) and congenital heart disease (CHD) in individuals with genetic variants in known HPE-related genes has been recurrently observed. Morphogenesis of the brain and heart from very early stages are regulated by several biological pathways, some of them involved in both heart and brain development as evidenced by genetic studies on model organisms. For instance, downregulation of Hedgehog or Nodal signaling pathways, both known as major triggers of HPE, has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of CHD, including structural defects and left-right asymmetry defects. In this study, individuals with various types of HPE were investigated clinically and by genomic sequencing. Cardiac phenotypes were assessed in 434 individuals with HPE who underwent targeted sequencing. CHDs were identified in 8% (n = 33) of individuals, including 10 (30%) cases of complex heart disease. Only four individuals (4/33) had damaging variants in the known HPE genes STAG2, SIX3, and SHH. Interestingly, no CHD was identified in the 37 individuals of our cohort with pathogenic variants in ZIC2. These findings suggest that CHD occurs more frequently in HPE-affected individuals with or without identifiable genetic variants, and this co-occurrence may be genetically driven and gene-specific.",

The population of adults with CHD is growing rapidly with advances in medical care. Overall survival to adulthood in the current era estimated to exceed 90%. Genetic causes of CHD can be classified into several broad categories: (a) chromosomal aneuploidy, (b) large chromosomal deletion or duplication, (c) single gene mutation, and (d) copy number variation. However, only 20–30% of CHD cases have an established etiology characterized by either genetic abnormalities or environmental factors. The role of genetics in the field of adult CHD is only increasing. More adult patients with CHD are seeking genetic counseling to understand the etiology of their underlying CHD and the risks to future offspring. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to provide appropriate counseling to patients regarding indications for genetic testing and interpretations of results. Novel advances with precision medicine may soon enable clinicians to individualize therapies for a comprehensive approach to the care of adult patients with CHD.",

The testing applies massively parallel sequencing or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray to circulating cell‐free DNA to determine relative copy number. In addition to trisomies 13, 18, and 21, some labs offer screening for sex chromosome abnormalities as part of their test. In this study, an index neonate screened positive for monosomy X and had discordant postnatal chromosomes indicating an X;autosome translocation. This patient prompted a retrospective chart review for similar cases at a large NIPS testing center. The review found 28 patients with an abnormal NIPS for monosomy X who were eventually diagnosed with additional discrepant structural sex chromosome abnormalities including translocations, isochromosomes, deletions, rings, markers, and uniparental disomy. The majority of these were mosaic with monosomy X, but in seven cases, there was no evidence of mosaicism on confirmatory testing. The identification of multiple sex chromosome aneuploidies in these cases supports the need for additional genetic counseling prior to NIPS testing and following abnormal NIPS results that are positive for monosomy X. This finding broadens our knowledge about the variable outcomes of positive monosomy X NIPS results and emphasizes the importance of confirmatory testing and clinical follow up for these patients.",

In their syndromic forms, retinal dystrophies can be observed in association with intellectual disability, frequently alongside other systemic manifestations. There are now over 80 genes implicated in syndromic retinal dystrophies with intellectual disability. Identifying and accurately characterizing these disorders allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis, evaluate for relevant associated features, arrive at a timely and accurate diagnosis, and address both sight‐threatening ocular manifestations and morbidity‐causing systemic manifestations. The co‐occurrence of retinal dystrophy and intellectual disability in an individual can be challenging to investigate, diagnose, and counsel given the considerable phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity that exists within this broad group of disorders. We performed a review of the current literature and propose an algorithm to facilitate the evaluation, and clinical and mechanistic classification, of these individuals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Blepharophimosis with intellectual disability (BIS) is a recently recognized disorder distinct from Nicolaides‐Baraister syndrome that presents with distinct facial features of blepharophimosis, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. BIS is caused by pathogenic variants in SMARCA2 , that encodes the catalytic subunit of the superfamily II helicase group of the BRG1 and BRM‐associated factors (BAF) forming the BAF complex, a chromatin remodeling complex involved in transcriptional regulation. Individuals bearing variants within the bipartite nuclear localization (BNL) signal domain of ADNP present with the neurodevelopmental disorder known as Helsmoortel‐Van Der Aa Syndrome (HVDAS). Distinct DNA methylation profiles referred to as episignatures have been reported in HVDAS and BAF complex disorders. Due to molecular interactions between ADNP and BAF complex, and an overlapping craniofacial phenotype with narrowing of the palpebral fissures in a subset of patients with HVDAS and BIS, we hypothesized the possibility of a common phenotype‐specific episignature. A distinct episignature was shared by 15 individuals with BIS‐causing SMARCA2 pathogenic variants and 12 individuals with class II HVDAS caused by truncating pathogenic ADNP variants. This represents first evidence of a sensitive phenotype‐specific episignature biomarker shared across distinct genetic conditions that also exhibit unique gene‐specific episignatures.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Trisomy 18 syndrome, also known as Edwards syndrome, is the second most common autosomal chromosome syndrome after Down syndrome. Trisomy 18 is a serious medical disorder due to the increased occurrence of structural defects, the high neonatal and infant mortality, and the disabilities observed in older children. Interventions, including cardiac surgery, remain controversial, and the traditional approach is to pursue pure comfort care. While the medical challenges have been well‐characterized, there are scant data on the parental views and perspective of the lived experience of rearing a child with trisomy 18. Knowledge of the parental viewpoints can help clinicians guide families through decision‐making. Our aim was to identify parents' perspectives by analyzing a series of narratives. In this qualitative study, we collected 46 parent narratives at the 2015 and 2016 conferences of the Support Organization for Trisomy 18 &amp; 13 (SOFT). The participants were asked to “Tell us a story about your experience.” Inductive content analysis and close reading were used to identify themes from the stories. Dedoose, a web‐based application to analyze qualitative data, was used to code themes more systematically. Of the identified themes, the most common included Impact of trisomy 18 diagnosis and Surpassing expectations . Other themes included Support from professionals , A child, not a diagnosis , and Trust/lack of trust . We examined the voice and the perspectives of the parents in their challenges in caring for their children with this life‐limiting condition. The exploration of the themes can ideally guide clinicians in their approach to the counseling and care of the child in a shared decision‐making approach.",

A detailed knowledge of the clinical and laboratory evaluation for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and other single‐gene disorders is obviously essential to complete a useful evaluation of such children. The experienced clinician will immediately recognize that single gene disorders represent only a small fraction of these patients. In infants, non‐accidental trauma (NAT) unfortunately is the likely explanation for the fracture pattern, but in some infants, and certainly in older children with recurrent fractures, no medical explanations can be found. Recent studies in which bone mineral density (BMD) has been associated with genetic variation at a number of candidate genes are promising but these studies are too premature yet to be used clinically. Nonetheless, we do expect that in the future whole‐genome approaches in conjunction with key clinical and epidemiological variables may be combined through an informatics approach to create better predictors of fracture susceptibility for these populations of patients. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Studies investigating genetic factors increasing suicide predisposition have been limited by current knowledge of the suicide neurobiology and have typically investigated one or a few genes at a time, whereas it is anticipated that several genes account for the total genetic variance mediating suicide. This review focuses on the advantages and the interest of using the microarray technology to investigate the neurobiology of suicide and discusses, by means of a data analysis example, the possible methodological problems and bioinformatic strategies that should be employed in order to separate the signal from the large amount of background noise, which is usually generated in such studies.

The major approach to identifying high‐risk groups for diseases, from Tay Sachs Disease to sickle cell disease, has historically centered on ethnic‐based screening. A major concern in an ethnic‐based approach is that carriers belonging to less‐traditionally considered populations will be missed. In the United States, the paradigm for a more modern pan‐ethnic approach has become exemplified by cystic fibrosis (CF), although considerable debate about future directions remains. CF screening brings several additional issues to the forefront, including that the largest molecular prenatal genetic screening program is based on a single gene disorder that is not necessarily severely disabling. On the other hand, several devastating disorders where screening is indeed available remain relatively inaccessible to prenatal patients in the general population. Future candidates to consider for broad‐based screening programs include spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), fragile X, and inborn errors of metabolism. As prenatal screening for single gene disorders expands, issues to consider include inclusion criteria and risk versus benefit. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

These efforts are well developed for molecular and cytogenetic testing and laboratories, and newborn screening programs, but assessing quality in clinical services has lagged, perhaps owing to the small work force and the recent evolution from a few large training programs to multiple training sites. We surveyed the English language, peer‐reviewed literature to summarize the knowledge‐base of quality assessment of genetics services, organized into the tripartite categories of the Donabedian model of “structure,” “process,” and “outcome.” MEDLINE searches from 1990 to July 2008, yielded 2,143 articles that addressed both “medical/genetic screening and counseling” and “quality indicators, control, and assurance.” Of the 2,143 titles, 131 articles were extracted for in‐depth analysis, and 55 were included in this review. Twenty‐nine articles focused on structure, 19 on process, and seven on outcomes. Our review underscored the urgent need for a coherent model that will provide health care organizations with tools to assess, report, monitor, and improve quality. The structure, process, and outcomes domains that make up the quality framework provide a comprehensive lens through which to examine quality in medical genetics. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

It deserves the balance of pertinent information coupled with medical guidance that forms the basis for shared decision‐making; all of which is ideally contained within a supportive environment. It requires a willingness to carefully listen to the specific concerns of the parents and family allowing them to revisit challenging issues as much as needed to encourage existing road blocks to be resolved. It necessitates that professionals see each and every family as unique, without preconceived notions about what is or is not important and being prepared to accept thoughts and decisions that may not fit with the professional's own beliefs. To some, this may sound impractical, inefficient, or even impossible within the time constrained models of modern day clinical services. However, in practice, this patient‐focused approach is arguably the most essential step in providing “personalized medicine” to the populations we encounter. This manuscript is intended to provide a brief review of relevant literature and case discussions to highlight issues for families learning of the diagnosis of HPE during a pregnancy, at birth, during childhood or more rarely, in adolescence.",

TSC is caused by loss of function mutations in one of two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 or TSC2 . Two‐thirds of individuals with TSC have de novo mutations, and individuals with postzygotic pathogenic variants in both TSC1 and TSC2 have been reported. The development of sensitive molecular methods, such as next generation sequencing, has led to an increased ability to detect low‐level mosaic variants, which are typically thought to have milder phenotypes because a smaller fraction of cells in the body harbor the mutation. Here, we describe two patients with TSC who had severe phenotypic involvement, but only low‐level mosaicism in TSC2 . Given this apparent discrepancy and concern about a missed constitutional variant, we sampled multiple tissues in both cases to confirm these mosaic mutations. Sampling of multiple tissues can be crucial in molecular diagnosis of mosaic TSC. These cases highlight, in general, challenges in molecular diagnosis of genetic conditions due to postzygotic mutations.",

    "abstract": "RASopathies are a group of genetic disorders due to dysregulation of the RAS‐MAPK signaling pathway, which is important in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. These include Noonan syndrome (NS), Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome, and Costello syndrome (CS), clinical manifestations include growth retardation, developmental delay, cardiac defects, and specific dysmorphic features. There were abundant publications describing the genotype and phenotype from the Western populations. However, detailed study of RASopathies in Chinese population is lacking. We present here the largest cohort of RASopathies ever reported in Chinese populations, detailing the mutation spectrum and clinical phenotypes of these patients. The Clinical Genetic Service, Department of Health, and Queen Mary Hospital are tertiary referral centers for genetic disorders in Hong Kong. We retrospectively reviewed all the genetically confirmed cases of RASopathies, including NS, NSML, CFC syndrome, and CS, over the past 29 years (from 1989 to 2017). Analyses of the mutation spectrum and clinical phenotypes were performed. One hundred and ninety‐one ethnic Chinese patients with genetically confirmed RASopathies were identified, including 148 patients with NS, 23 NSML, 12 CFC syndrome, and eight CS. We found a lower incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in individuals with NSML (27.3%), and NS caused by RAF1 mutations (62.5%). Another significant finding was for those NS patients with myeloproliferative disorder, the mutations fall within Exon 3 of PTPN11 but not only restricted to the well‐known hotspots, that is, p.Asp61 and p.Thr731, which suggested that re‐evaluation of the current tumor surveillance recommendation maybe warranted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this article, we problematize the concept of “culture” in genetic counseling. With globalization and increased mobility of both genetic professionals and clients, there is an increased acknowledgement of the impact of “culture” on a counseling process. There is, however, little agreement on what “culture” is. The essentialist understanding that has long been dominant in the medical literature views culture as a set of shared beliefs, attitudes and practices among a group of people. Such an approach does not account for the individual differences and the dynamic nature of genetic counseling encounters. Following Zayts and Schnurr (2017), we use the distinction between two orders of culture: culture 1 that refers to the static, generalized understanding of culture that is external to the specific context, and culture 2 , an analytic concept that denotes dynamic enactments of culture, emerging in the interaction. We use empirical data from genetic counseling sessions to illustrate these different facets of culture and to consider how and why speakers draw on them. The clinical implications of the study include highlighting the importance of cultural awareness among counselors, including cultural self‐awareness, and demonstrating how authentic interactional data could be used to enhance cultural training in genetic counseling.",

Mutations can occur at any point in embryonic development and the timing determines the extent of distribution of the mutation throughout the body and different tissue types. The eye and visual pathway offer a unique opportunity to study somatic and gonosomal mosaic mutations as the eye consists of tissues derived from all three germ layers allowing disease pathology to be assessed with noninvasive imaging. In this review, we describe systemic and ocular manifestations in a child with mosaic Coffin‐Siris syndrome. The patient presented with a significant medical history of accommodative esotropia and hyperopia, macrocephaly, polydactyly, global developmental delay, hypotonia, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, and brain MRI abnormalities. The ophthalmic findings in this patient were nonspecific, however, they are consistent with ocular manifestations reported in other patients with Coffin‐Siris syndrome. We also review ophthalmic findings of select mosaic chromosomal and single‐gene disorders. Ophthalmic assessment alongside clinical genetic testing may play an important role in diagnosis of genetic syndromes as well as understanding disease pathology, particularly when mosaicism plays a role.",

Due to geographic isolation, small population sizes, and socioeconomic disparities, most Caribbean islands lack medical services for managing, diagnosing, and counseling individuals with genetic disorders. From 2015 to 2019, we organized 2–3 clinics per year on various islands in the Caribbean. We also organized a week‐long clinic to provide evaluations for children suspected of having autism spectrum disorder. Consultations for over 100 different individuals with suspected genetic disorders were performed in clinics or during home visits following referral by locally registered physicians. When possible, follow‐up visits were attempted. When available and appropriate, clinical samples were shipped to collaborating laboratories for molecular analysis. Laboratory tests included karyotyping, cytogenomic microarray analysis, exome sequencing, triplet repeat expansion testing, blood amino acid level determination, biochemical assaying, and metabolomic profiling. We believe that significant contributions to healthcare by genetics professionals can be made even if availability is limited. Visiting geneticists may help by providing continuing medical education seminars. Clinical teaching rounds help to inform local physicians regarding the management of genetic disorders with the aim of generating awareness of genetic conditions. Even when only periodically available, a visiting geneticist may benefit affected individuals, their families, their local physicians, and the community at large.",

The COVID‐19 pandemic pushed telemedicine from small and pilot programs to widespread practice at an unprecedented rate. With the rapid implementation of telemedicine, it is important to consider how to create a telehealth system that provides both good care for patients and families while maintaining an excellent education environment for trainees of all levels. To this end, we developed telemedicine educational milestones to describe novel skills required to provide high quality telemedicine care, and allow trainees and clinical educators a metric by which to assess trainee progress. We also created methods and tools to help trainees learn and families feel comfortable in their new role as virtual collaborators. We envision a time when safety does not set the venue; instead the needs of the patient will dictate whether a virtual or in‐person visit is the right choice for a family. We expect that pediatric medical genetics and metabolism groups across the country will continue to set a standard of a hybrid care system to meet the unique needs of each individual patient, using telemedicine technology.",

MPS II has wide allelic and clinical heterogeneity and a complex genotype–phenotype correlation. We evaluated data from 501 Brazilian patients diagnosed with MPS II from 1982 to 2020. We genotyped 280 of these patients (55.9%), which were assigned to 206 different families. Point mutations were present in 70% of our patients, being missense variants the most frequent. We correlated the IDS pathogenic variants identified with the phenotype (neuronophatic or non‐neuronopathic). Except for two half‐brothers, there was no discordance in the genotype–phenotype correlation among family members, nor among MPS II patients from different families with the same single base‐pair substitution variant. Mothers were carriers in 82.0% of the cases. This comprehensive study of the molecular profile of the MPS II cases in Brazil sheds light on the genotype–phenotype correlation and helps the better understanding of the disease and the prediction of its clinical course, enabling the provision of a more refined genetic counseling to the affected families.",

Treatment consists in leucine (LEU), isoleucine (ILE), and valine (VAL) (branched-chain amino acids) dietary restriction and strict metabolic control. to determine the characteristics of the Chilean cohort with MSUD currently in follow-up at Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos, during the 1990-2017 period Retrospective analytical study in 45 MSUD cases. Measured: biochemical parameters (LEU, ILE, and VAL), anthropometric evaluation, and neurocognitive development. In 18 cases undergoing genetic study were analyzed according to the gene and protein location, number of affected alleles, and type of posttranslational modification affected. Then, 45 patients with MSUD diagnosis were identified during the period: 37 were alive at the time of the study. Average diagnosis age was 71 ± 231 days. Average serum diagnosis LEU concentrations: 1.463 ± 854.1 μmol/L, VAL 550 ± 598 μmol/L and ILE 454 ± 458 μmol/L.

Once thought to principally affect just connective tissues, hEDS is now appreciated to be a multisystem disease of great heterogeneity with many symptoms and findings difficult to attribute solely to disordered connective tissue development. In the last decade, there has been growth in the appreciation of the existence of a wide range of disorders of chronic inappropriate mast cell (MC) activation (a large heterogeneous pool of MC activation syndromes [MCAS]) distinguishable from other MC disorders such as rare neoplastic mastocytosis. Via chronic aberrant release of the MC's vast repertoire of potent mediators, MCAS can drive extraordinary arrays of pathologies, most commonly of inflammatory, allergic, and dystrophic natures. Although hEDS is seen in only a minority of MCAS cases, limited studies have identified an association between hEDS and MCAS, fueling speculation that certain variants of MCAS may drive hEDS. No laboratory studies probing cellular or molecular linkages between hEDS and MCAS have been conducted yet, and research efforts to identify the genetic roots of hEDS should also consider those of MCAS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Monogenic disorders of the kidney typically affect either the glomerular or tubulointerstitial compartment producing a distinct set of clinical phenotypes. Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), for instance, is characterized by glomerular scarring with proteinuria and hypertension while nephronophthisis (NPHP) is associated with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, salt wasting, and low‐ to normal blood pressure. For both diseases, an expanding number of non‐overlapping genes with roles in glomerular filtration or primary cilium homeostasis, respectively, have been identified. TTC21B , encoding IFT139, however has been associated with disorders of both the glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartment, and linked with defective podocyte cytoskeleton and ciliary transport, respectively. Starting from a case report of extreme early‐onset hypertension, proteinuria, and progressive kidney disease, as well as data from the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project, we illustrate here the difficulties in assigning this mixed phenotype to the correct genetic diagnosis. Careful literature review supports the notion that biallelic, often hypomorph, missense variants in TTC21B are commonly associated with early‐onset hypertension and histological features of both FSGS and NPHP. Increased clinical recognition of this mixed glomerular and tubulointerstitial disease with often mild or absent features of a typical ciliopathy as well as inclusion of TTC21B on gene panels for early‐onset arterial hypertension might shorten the diagnostic odyssey for patients affected by this rare tubuloglomerular kidney disease.",

The study showed that a significant number of genetic counselors (84.5%) have conducted previous research, and 69.4% of respondents plan to perform research in the future. These results reflect the maturation of the genetic counseling field, in that a substantial number of genetic counselors consider active involvement in research to be a core role.

    "abstract": "Abstract The bone dysplasias are a heterogeneous group of disorders arising from intrinsic abnormality of bone and cartilage growth and function. All are genetic. Most result in extreme small stature (dwarfism). Historically, emphasis was primarily on diagnostic identification of specific disorders in infants (including differentiating lethal and non‐lethal forms), and on the clinical history to be anticipated in infants and children with each of these specific processes. Even in children there is exceedingly limited information of quality and virtually no controlled studies of the effects of intervention. For the most part, information about affected adults is even less complete and even less rigorous. Presented here are a series of examples of medical and adaptive issues in adults affected by one or another of the genetic skeletal dysplasias. Topics discussed include: approach to adults with no specific diagnosis; medical issues that cross diagnostic boundaries (osteoarthritis in the “E” disorders, obstructive apnea, issues in pregnancy in women with dwarfing disorders, activities of daily living, and quality of life assessments); diagnosis‐specific problems of adulthood (spinal stenosis in achondroplasia, hearing loss in osteogenesis imperfecta, and malignancy risk in multiple exostoses); adult problems that must be addressed in childhood in order to be prevented (achondroplasia and kyphosis, and cervical spine abnormalities in Morquio syndrome); survival conundrums (why some live unexpectedly and others die unexpectedly). Emphasis is placed on the difficulties intrinsic to trying to learn about needs and expectations in generally rare genetic processes. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a common developmental forebrain malformation, is characterized by failure of the cerebrum to completely divide into left and right hemispheres. The etiology of HPE is heterogeneous and a number of environmental and genetic factors have been identified. Cytogenetically visible alterations occur in 25% to 45% of HPE patients and cytogenetic techniques have long been used to study copy number variants (CNVs) in this disorder. The karyotype approach initially demonstrated several recurrent chromosomal anomalies, which led to the identification of HPE‐specific loci and, eventually, several major HPE genes. More recently, higher‐resolution cytogenetic techniques such as subtelomeric multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification and chromosomal microarray have been used to analyze chromosomal anomalies. By using chromosomal microarray, we sought to identify submicroscopic chromosomal deletions and duplications in patients with HPE. In an analysis of 222 individuals with HPE, a deletion or duplication was detected in 107 individuals. Of these 107 individuals, 23 (21%) had variants that were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic by board‐certified medical geneticists. We identified multiple patients with deletions in established HPE loci as well as three patients with deletions encompassed by 6q12‐q14.3, a CNV previously reported by Bendavid et al. In addition, we identified a new locus, 16p13.2 that warrants further investigation for HPE association. Incidentally, we also found a case of Potocki‐Lupski syndrome, a case of Phelan‐McDermid syndrome, and multiple cases of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome within our cohort. These data confirm the genetically heterogeneous nature of HPE, and also demonstrate clinical utility of chromosomal microarray in diagnosing patients affected by HPE.",

We report the largest BRWD3 patient series to date, comprising 17 males with 12 distinct null variants and 2 partial gene deletions. All patients presented with intellectual disability, which was classified as moderate (65%) or mild (35%). Behavioral issues were present in 75% of patients, including aggressive behavior, attention deficit/hyperactivity and/or autistic spectrum disorders. Mean head circumference was +2.8 SD (2.8 standard deviations above the mean), and mean BMI was +2.0 SD (in the context of a mean height of +1.3 SD), indicating a predominant macrocephaly/obesity phenotype. Shared facial features included a tall chin, prognathism, broad forehead, and prominent supraorbital ridge. Additional features, reported in a minority (<30%) of patients included cryptorchidism, neonatal hypotonia, and small joint hypermobility. This study delineates the clinical features associated with BRWD3 null variants and partial gene deletions, and suggests that BRWD3 should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with an overgrowth-intellectual disability (OGID) phenotype, particularly in male patients with a mild or moderate intellectual disability associated with macrocephaly and/or obesity.",

Therefore, it is not surprising to see differences among the countries regarding expertise, education, and practices of ophthalmic genetics for patients with rare eye diseases. Nevertheless, common challenges such as limited genetics training in medical schools and among ophthalmologists, scarcity of diagnostic tools for phenotyping, and expensive genetic testing not covered by the public healthcare systems, are seen in all of them. Here, we provide a detailed report of the current status of ophthalmic genetics, described by the personal views of local ophthalmologists from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile. By reporting our strengths and weaknesses as a region, we intend to highlight the need for guidelines on how to manage these patients aligned with public health policies. Our region contributes to research worldwide, with thousands of well diagnosed patients from a number of unique and genetically diverse populations. The constant expansion of ophthalmic genetics and molecular diagnostics requires us to join forces to collaborate across South America and with other countries to improve access to next‐generation diagnostics and ultimately improve patient care.",

We characterized the clinical/genetic features of four patients with RP2 ‐associated retinal disorder ( RP2 ‐RD) from four Japanese families in a nationwide cohort. A systematic review of RP2 ‐RD in the Japanese population was also performed. All four patients were clinically diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The mean age at examination was 36.5 (10–47) years, and the mean visual acuity in the right/left eye was 1.40 (0.52–2.0)/1.10 (0.52–1.7) in the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution unit, respectively. Three patients showed extensive retinal atrophy with macular involvement, and one had central retinal atrophy. Four RP2 variants were identified, including two novel missense (p.Ser6Phe, p.Leu189Pro) and two previously reported truncating variants (p.Arg120Ter, p.Glu269CysfsTer3). The phenotypes of two patients with truncating variants were more severe than the phenotypes of two patients with missense variants. A systematic review revealed additional 11 variants, including three missense and eight deleterious (null) variants, and a statistically significant association between phenotype severity and genotype severity was revealed. The clinical and genetic spectrum of RP2 ‐RD was illustrated in the Japanese population, identifying the characteristic features of a severe form of RP with early macular involvement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Diagnosis of individuals affected by monogenic disorders was significantly improved by next‐generation sequencing targeting clinically relevant genes. Whole exomes yield a large number of variants that require several filtering steps, prioritization, and pathogenicity classification. Among the criteria recommended by ACMG, those that rely on population databases critically affect analyses of individuals with underrepresented ancestries. Population‐specific allelic frequencies need consideration when characterizing potential deleteriousness of variants. An orthogonal input for classification is annotation of variants previously classified as pathogenic as a criterion that provide supporting evidence widely sourced at ClinVar. We used a whole‐genome dataset from a census‐based cohort of 1,171 elderly individuals from São Paulo, Brazil, highly admixed, and unaffected by severe monogenic disorders, to investigate if pathogenic assertions in ClinVar are enriched with higher proportions of European ancestry, indicating bias. Potential loss of function (pLOF) variants were filtered from 4,250 genes associated with Mendelian disorders and annotated with ClinVar assertions. Over 1,800 single nucleotide pLOF variants were included, 381 had non‐benign assertions. Among carriers ( N = 463), average European ancestry was significantly higher than noncarriers ( N = 708; p = .011). pLOFs in genomic contexts of non‐European local ancestries were nearly three times less likely to have any ClinVar entry (OR = 0.353; p &lt;.0001). Independent pathogenicity assertions are useful for variant classification in molecular diagnosis. However, European overrepresentation of assertions can promote distortions when classifying variants in non‐European individuals, even in admixed samples with a relatively high proportion of European ancestry. The investigation and deposit of clinically relevant findings of diverse populations is fundamental improve this scenario.",

IBS patients present with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as abdominal pain with altered bowel habits; however, some patients also have non‐GI symptoms including muscle and joint pains. It is thus plausible that within large IBS cohorts, subgroups exist with distinct clinical phenotypes. Yet, these subgroups have not been clearly identified or characterized. Due to lack of segmentation, treatment‐focused symptomatic management is similar for all with IBS and follows indiscriminate algorithms regardless of possible differing clinical phenotype. This universal approach to IBS management may account for the reported lack of efficacy of treatment. One emerging subgroup receiving increasing attention is that with overlap IBS and the underlying heritable connective tissue disorder, hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS). Current evidence suggests that up to 62% of patients with hEDS suffer from IBS. However, despite recognition of the presence of IBS in hEDS, this overlap IBS/hEDS group has not been characterized and these patients are managed in a similar way to those with IBS alone. Future studies are required to characterize and deep phenotype in this overlap IBS/hEDS group.",

Little work has been done to evaluate the general utility of a multispecialty approach to patient care. Previous research demonstrates several advantages and disadvantages of multispecialty care. This research aims to better understand the benefits and limitations of a multidisciplinary clinic setting for individuals with CdLS and related diagnoses. Parents of children with CdLS and related diagnoses who have visited a multidisciplinary clinic (N = 52) and who have not visited a multidisciplinary clinic (N = 69) were surveyed to investigate their attitudes. About 90.0% of multispecialty clinic attendees indicated a preference for multidisciplinary care. However, some respondents cited a need for additional clinic services including more opportunity to meet with other specialists (N = 20), such as behavioral health, and increased information about research studies (N = 15). Travel distance and expenses often prevented families’ multidisciplinary clinic attendance (N = 41 and N = 35, respectively). Despite identified limitations, these findings contribute to the evidence demonstrating the utility of a multispecialty approach to patient care. This approach ultimately has the potential to not just improve healthcare for individuals with CdLS but for those with medically complex diagnoses in general. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Various congenital malformations and medical complications have been described with gastroesophageal reflux as the major one. CdLS patients often require multiple high-risk anesthetic procedures. At San Gerardo Hospital (Monza, Italy) the management of CdLS patients is routinely organized through a standard protocol and a dedicated pediatric anesthesia team has been implemented. We report on a retrospective descriptive analysis of the anesthetic records of the CdLS patients admitted to San Gerardo Hospital from January 2010 to December 2015. We retrieved: demographics, genetic profiles, type of procedures, anesthetic approaches, anesthetics usage and complications. Data are reported as median (interquartile range) values. Twenty-seven patients (11 female), with age 12 (7-15) years old, weight 24 (14-35) kg, and severity score of 25 (18-32) were included. NIBPL mutations were the most frequently represented.

    "abstract": "Abstract Ellis–van Creveld syndrome (EvC) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder involving pathogenic variants of EVC and EVC2 genes and classified as a ciliopathy. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the EVC gene on chromosome 4p16, and EVC2 gene, located close to the EVC gene, in a head‐to‐head configuration. Regardless of the affliction of EVC or EVC2 , the clinical features of Ellis–van Creveld syndrome are similar. Both these genes are expressed in tissues such as, but not limited to, the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and placenta, while the predominant expression in the craniofacial tissues is that of EVC2 . Biallelic mutations of EVC and EVC2 affect Hedgehog signaling and thereby ciliary function, crucial factors in vertebrate development, culminating in the phenotypical features characteristic of EvC. The clinical features of Ellis–van Creveld syndrome are consistent with significant abnormalities in morphogenesis and differentiation of the affected tissues. The robust role of primary cilia in histodifferentiation and morphodifferentiation of oral, perioral, and craniofacial tissues is becoming more evident in the most recent literature. In this review, we give a summary of the mechanistic role of primary cilia in craniofacial development, taking Ellis–van Creveld syndrome as a representative example.",

We sought to characterize the diagnostic experiences of families and describe their preferences for newborn screening (NBS). We conducted a registry‐based survey of families with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy that included open‐ and closed‐ended questions regarding the journey to a diagnosis, preferences for when to learn of a diagnosis, and how knowledge of a diagnosis would impact life decisions. Open‐ended responses were analyzed thematically, and closed‐ended responses were analyzed descriptively. Sixty‐five families completed the survey. The average ages of first concern and diagnosis were 2 and 4 years, respectively. One‐third of families (30%) indicated that they would prefer to receive a diagnosis in the newborn period irrespective of treatment options available, and nearly all of the remaining families (93%) indicated that they would want to learn about a diagnosis if there were treatments that worked well during the newborn period. All families (100%) indicated that a diagnosis in the newborn period would impact life decisions. We identified three overarching themes, which described the stages of the diagnostic journey, including having concerns about the child, seeking answers, and receiving the diagnosis. NBS can facilitate improved health outcomes through early access to care, and inform families on major health and nonhealth decisions. The preferences and experiences of families and other stakeholders should be considered when determining the potential value and benefit of expanding NBS programs.",

Puberty disorders and gonadal dysfunction, in particular in males, are other endocrinological areas to evaluate for their effects on growth and development. Thyroid dysfunction, autoimmune disease and bone involvement have also been reported in RASopathies. In this brief review, we describe the current knowledge on growth, growth hormone therapy, endocrinological involvement in patients affected by RASopathies.",

A database can also serve as a valuable source of patients for studies of disease pathogenesis, variability, or treatment. We review the strengths and limitations of genetic disease databases in the context of our experience with the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation International Database (NNFFID). Genetic disease databases have been developed by individual investigators, scientific consortia, patient support organizations, and commercial enterprises. Databases vary from simple lists of affected individuals to comprehensive collections of detailed clinical and genetic information. Data may be obtained from people who volunteer to be included, systematic assessments of patients seen at participating medical centers, or population-based registries. Access to information may be highly restricted or widely available. These variables all affect the possible uses and usefulness of the data for research. Technical aspects of data entry, organization, storage, and retrieval, as well as issues related to data quality, confidentiality, and security, help determine how well a system actually functions. We discuss examples of research that have been accomplished with genetic disease databases and make recommendations regarding the organization and operation of these resources.",

Genetic counseling was provided with a focus on the basic genetics of WS, recurrence risk, and on participants' attitudes toward socio‐cultural topics. Forty‐nine percent indicated that they would be okay or happy if their baby had WS, 44% said they would be sad or upset, and 5% were unsure. The sad/upset group was significantly older than the okay/happy group and a significantly higher proportion of the former group indicated that they did not plan to have children. During the post‐counseling session participants were questioned to determine if they recalled the facts previously presented. Eighty‐one percent correctly gave the odds that their child would have WS. Fifty‐three percent considered the 50–50 odds to be a high chance. After genetic counseling, 61% were able to state something that had been taught and 88% indicated that they would want to test their baby for WS before birth. Ninety‐eight percent would recommend genetic counseling to others. Findings indicate that based on the type of genetic counseling provided in this study, the majority of individuals with WS—a genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability but with relative strengths in (concrete) language and in verbal rote memory—are able to learn simple facts about the genetics of WS and are eager to respond to socio‐cultural questions regarding topics typically included in genetic counseling sessions. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Two hallmarks of KS‐affecting testicular functions are consistently observed: Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and germ cell (GC) loss resulting in infertility. Although KS is being studied for decades, the underlying mechanisms for the observed pathophysiology are still unclear. Due to ethical restrictions, studies in humans are limited, and consequently, suitable animal models are needed to address the consequences of a supernumerary X chromosome. Mouse strains with comparable aneuploidies have been generated and yielded highly relevant insights into KS. We briefly describe the establishment of the KS mouse models, summarize the knowledge gained by their use, compare findings from the mouse models to those obtained in clinical studies, and also reflect on limitations of the currently used models derived from the B6Ei.Lt‐Y* mouse strain, in which the Y chromosome is altered and its centromere position changed into a more distal location provoking meiotic non‐disjunction. Breeding such as XY* males to XX females, the target 41,XX Y *, and 41,XXY males are generated. Here, we summarize features of both models but report in particular findings from our 41,XX Y * mice including some novel data on Sertoli cell characteristics.",

The range of severity of the phenotype is substantial. We considered whether this variable outcome was related to the presence of copy number variants (CNVs)—stretches of duplicated or deleted DNA. A sample of 125 children with an SCT were compared with 181 children of normal karyotype who had been given the same assessments. First, we compared the groups on measures of overall CNV burden: number of CNVs, total span of CNVs, and likely functional impact (probability of loss‐of‐function intolerance, pLI, summed over CNVs). Differences between groups were small relative to within‐group variance and not statistically significant on overall test. Next, we considered whether a measure of general neurodevelopmental impairment was predicted by pLI summed score, SCT versus comparison group, or the interaction between them. There was a substantial effect of SCT/comparison status but the pLI score was not predictive of outcomes in either group. We conclude that variable presence of CNVs is not a likely explanation for the wide phenotypic variation in children with SCTs. We discuss methodological challenges of testing whether CNVs are implicated in causing neurodevelopmental problems.",

We described 26 individuals with NS from a single large referral center in the South West of Colombia using an established database in the genetics department and hospital records search using ICD-10 codes. All patients included in this study were evaluated by a medical geneticist and have molecular confirmation of NS diagnosis. The median age at referral was 3.5 years (range, 0-39), and at molecular diagnosis was 5 years (range, 0-40). Patients mostly originated from the southwest region of Colombia (19/26, 73%). Pathogenic variants in PTPN11 are the most common cause of NS in Colombian individuals followed by SHOC2 and SOS1 variants. The prevalence of cardiomyopathy was low in this population compared to other populations. Further research is needed with a larger sample size and including different regions of Colombia to correlate our findings. This study provides new information about time to diagnosis of NS in Colombia, genotypes, and provides important information to help develop guidelines for diagnosis and management of this disease in the region.",

    "abstract": "Congenital anemias comprise a group of blood disorders characterized by a reduction in the number of peripherally circulating erythrocytes. Various genetic etiologies have been identified that affect diverse aspects of erythroid physiology and broadly fall into two main categories: impaired production or increased destruction of mature erythrocytes. Current therapies are largely focused on symptomatic treatment and are often based on transfusion of donor‐derived erythrocytes and management of complications. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represents the only curative option currently available for the majority of congenital anemias. Recent advances in gene therapy and genome editing hold promise for the development of additional curative strategies for these blood disorders. The relative ease of access to the hematopoietic stem cell compartment, as well as the possibility of genetic manipulation ex vivo and subsequent transplantation in an autologous manner, make blood disorders among the most amenable to cellular therapies. Here we review cell‐based and gene therapy approaches, and discuss the limitations and prospects of emerging avenues, including genome editing tools and the use of pluripotent stem cells, for the treatment of congenital forms of anemia. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We highlight “山海经” ( Shan Hai Jing , translated as the Classic of Mountains and Seas ), a remarkable collection of myths and illustrations which documented the existence of dwarf communities where the residents were capable of producing high‐quality grains. Representations from sculptures and paintings frequently captured the images of individuals with dwarfism in royal courts, which showed their remarkable performance skills and social ability. There are also works of art associating dwarfism with rituals. In addition to portraying ordinary individuals with humble social status, there was one particular individual with dwarfism named Yan Zi (晏子) who was highly regarded as a figure of wisdom. Throughout the long Chinese history, dwarfism had been portrayed in art as either positive, neutral or derogatory, which reflected the fact that people with dwarfism, while short in stature, are usually intellectually normal, generally skillful, and often talented, in short, like the general population.",

Although next‐generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are currently the preferred methods for analyzing these conditions, some of the published results have not shown a detection rate as high as it would be expected. The present study aimed to assess the diagnostic yield of targeted NGS combined with Sanger sequencing (SS) for low‐coverage exons of genes of interest and exome sequencing (ES) in a series of patients with rare SD and use two patients as an example of our strategy. This study used two different in‐house panels. Of 93 variants found in 88/114 (77%) patients, 57 are novel. The pathogenic variants found in the following genes: B3GALT6 , PCYT1A , INPPL1 , LIFR , of four patients were only detected by SS. In conclusion, the high diagnostic yield reached in the present study can be attributed to both a good selection of patients and the utilization of the SS for the insufficiently covered regions. Additionally, the two case reports—a patient with acrodysostosis related to PRKAR1A and another with ciliopathy associated with KIAA0753 , add new and relevant clinical information to the current knowledge.",

GH is released from the pituitary in a pulsatile fashion under the control of GHRH, Ghrelin, and somatostatin and, via a complex signal transduction cascade, initiates the release of IGF-I within many tissues but predominantly the liver and at the growth plate. IGF-I acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner via the IGF-I receptor to stimulate cell proliferation and longitudinal growth. Activation of the pituitary–gonadal axis during puberty occurs via a complex interaction of factors including kisspeptin, leptin, gonadotrophin releasing hormone, and tachykinin ultimately leading to augmentation of GH secretion, the pubertal growth spurt, and fusion of the growth plates. Many other hormones can affect the GH-IGF-I system or directly affect cell proliferation at the growth plate including thyroid hormone, vitamin D, and corticosteroids. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The designation, phenotype, was proposed as a term by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909. The word is derived from the Greek, phano (showing) and typo (type), phanotypos . Phenotype has become a widely recognized term, even outside of the genetics community, in recent years with the ongoing identification of human disease genes. The term has been defined as the observable constitution of an organism, but sometimes refers to a condition when a person has a particular clinical presentation. Analysis of phenotype is a timely theme because advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of human disease and the emergence of next generation sequencing have spurred a renewed interest in phenotype and the proposal to establish a “Human Phenome Project.” This article summarizes the principles of phenotype analysis that are important in medical genetics and describes approaches to comprehensive phenotype analysis in the investigation of patients with human disorders. I discuss the various elements related to disease phenotypes and highlight neurofibromatosis type 1 and the Elements of Morphology Project as illustrations of the principles. In recent years, the notion of “deep phenotyping” has emerged. Currently there are now a number of proposed strategies and resources to approach this concept. Not since the 1960s and 1970s has there been such an exciting time in the history of medicine surrounding the analysis of phenotype in genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "We reviewed sequencing, variant and clinical data from patients recruited to the \"Congenital Malformations caused by Ciliopathies\" (CMC) cohort of the UK 100,000 Genomes Project (100K) (Best et al., 2021).11 Published 2021 with data from Main Program Release 11 (dated December 17, 2020). At that time, 16/83 of the \"Congenital Malformations caused by Ciliopathies\" cohort (19.3%) did not have a complete GMC exit questionnaire. By using domain-specific knowledge of ciliopathy genetics (Reiter & Leroux, 2017; Wheway et al., 2019), and examining variants in non-ciliopathy disease genes, we were able to identify potentially causative variants beyond those reported by the triaging process implemented by Genomics England (GEL, the company set up to run 100K). As a result, we increased diagnoses from the 27/83 (32.5%) that were reported by GEL, to 43/83 (51.8%). During this work, we experienced several difficulties in accessing and working with the data and observed several limitations with the currently available datasets. Here, we review these issues, suggest ways in which 100K data could be made more accessible and utilized more fully for patient benefit, and propose lessons that can be learned for future large-scale human genomics studies. The issues are grouped into four broad categories: those relating to the clinical information available for recruited individuals; issues relating to the triaging and prioritization process for variants (so-called \"tiering\"); difficulties experienced using the secure GEL research environment; and difficulties in reporting pertinent research findings back to recruiting clinicians. In the early stages of recruitment to 100K, recruiters were required to comply with strict entry criteria. These included pre-screening of the key genes or gene panels relevant to the participant's condition, the recruitment of parent-child trios and adherence to a complex, time-consuming process for the uploading of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. However, pressure to recruit from busy NHS clinics led to relaxation of requirements for pre-screening and trio recruitment, and frequently resulted in sparse HPO term usage, with patient phenotypes often described using only one or two terms from one organ system. The choice of organ system may have reflected the interests and expertise of the recruiting clinician: for instance, many participants in the CMC cohort were recruited under solely vision-related terms such as rod-cone dystrophy, with limited or absent information about extra-ocular, syndromic features. As a result, the relevance of HPO terms varies across the cohort, ranging from accurate and highly informative to unhelpful or even misleading. Additional data from longitudinal patient records are accessible using the \"Participant Explorer\" tool, but these are available only in a proportion of cases, are of variable quality and are not collated in a form that can be readily used for phenotype-genotype correlation and variant prioritization. The accuracy of HPO descriptions has a direct impact on diagnostic success. 100K was configured to communicate results only from one or more virtual panels of genes that are defined in the GEL PanelApp database as relevant to a participant's suspected condition, based on entered HPO terms (although there is also ethical approval for broader variant screening on a research basis). The selection of gene panels is therefore largely dependent on the HPO descriptions. Thus, inappropriate HPO descriptions will inevitably lead to inappropriate gene panel selection and therefore to missed diagnoses because the correct disease gene(s) have not been analyzed. For example, a participant in the \"epilepsy plus other features\" category, with keratoconus and epilepsy as the entered HPO terms, was found to have bi-allelic pathogenic CEP290 variants. In a reverse phenotyping approach following contact with the recruiting clinician, it emerged that this participant had key ophthalmological features that were not entered during recruitment to 100K, comprising a formal diagnosis of Leber Congenital Amaurosis. The GEL tiering system prioritizes variants for analysis by regional NHS diagnostic laboratories. Clinical assessment is only expected for prioritized Tier 1 and 2 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or Tier A structural variants, which are provided in a report. Tiered variants are primarily limited to those variants affecting coding sequences and splice donor or acceptor sites. These are rare protein damaging (Tier 1) or protein altering (Tier 2) variants in genes on selected panel(s) in which the allelic state matches the known mode of inheritance for the gene and disorder, and segregates with disease where familial sequence data is available. Copy number variants and structural variants have been classified Tier A (>10 kb in appropriate PanelApp genes) or Tier Null in cases recruited toward the end of the project, but these have not yet been systematically analyzed in the whole cohort. Rare SNVs in genes not on the selected panel(s) are classed as Tier 3. These include variants known or predicted to be pathogenic but not in a relevant PanelApp gene, or in a relevant gene but considered insufficient to explain the phenotype, such as a heterozygous variant in a gene implicated in recessive disease. All other variants are un-tiered (although white-listing of known pathogenic variants is an area of active development). Tier 3 and un-tiered variants are not inspected routinely by NHS diagnostic labs, and left to external researchers to consider more fully, if at all. In our own work (Best et al., 2021), we identified 11/83 probands (13.3%) with research molecular diagnoses with at least one variant outside of tiers 1 and 2. Five tier 3 variants and 12 untiered variants contribute to the diagnoses for these 11 participants. Furthermore, no attempt has yet been made to prioritize less obvious splicing defects using SpliceAI (Jaganathan et al., 2019) or a similar program, or to analyze variants in intronic regions. One obvious limitation of reporting based on these partial analyses is that many recessive alleles appear monoallelic because the second allele is a structural, splice or intronic variant missed by the current GEL pipeline. These single recessive pathogenic alleles in relevant PanelApp genes will then be classed as Tier 3 and not prioritized for analysis because they alone cannot explain the participant's phenotype. Anecdotally, we understand that some participants were recruited because a diagnostic laboratory had previously identified one variant in a relevant recessive gene, and the referring clinician anticipated that genome analysis would reveal the second. Instead, the eventual report was negative, lacking even the known variant, leading to confusion for clinicians and clinical scientists. Given the ever-increasing demand for genetic testing, there seems little likelihood that NHS laboratories will have the operational flexibility to reassess these data in response to improvements in the GEL variant detection pipeline. In practice, therefore, although participants have a whole genome sequence, variant identification is typically no better than a targeted gene panel analysis. Given the limitations of the variant identification and triaging carried out by GEL itself, any further screening is dependent on individual researchers revisiting the data on a research basis. Our experience of the GEL secure research environment is that it can be a frustrating and uninviting area within which to work. Service interruption is not infrequent and can lead to work disruption and data loss. Scripts must be self-contained for security reasons and must be security checked before importing, meaning users tend to work with and adapt what is already there rather than importing alternative tools and pipelines that are more fit for purpose. Opportunities for training are limited, meaning the aspiring genomics researcher is often dependent on generous collaborators who are already familiar with the research environment and are willing to share their skills and code. Use of the Linux command line is required for several investigative strategies within the GEL research environment, which is unfamiliar and intimidating to many inexperienced clinicians and scientists and requires significant time investment to master. The lack of a forum for script sharing, advice and learning from others seems a significant omission. An MSc program in Genomic Medicine was intended to address this deficit, but many of the funded programs completed before the data was released, missing an opportunity for hands-on training within the GEL secure research environment. We accept that many of these issues arise from the need to protect patient data, which will in turn limit the scope for changes to the GEL research environment. Nevertheless, these difficulties have the effect of making training and collaboration more difficult and are a further disincentive to those wishing to work with 100K data. That many still do is a testament to the huge potential research value of this resource, but any efforts to make it more accessible could significantly enhance exploitation and patient benefit. We encountered significant problems disseminating identified diagnoses to recruiting clinicians, which limited the returning of results to patients and publication of findings. Reporting of research findings must be carried out through the 100,000 Genomes Airlock system using the \"Researcher Identified Potential Diagnosis\" and \"Clinician Contact\" process. The researcher submits their findings to this system using a request form, which is sent to the recruiting clinician, who remains anonymous unless and until they choose to respond. In our experience, the response rate is less than 20%. This may reflect the time that has elapsed since recruitment (2013–2018), meaning that some clinicians may have moved post. Such a low response rate is another major obstacle to research on 100K cohorts. Researchers can publish un-identifiable overview findings without involving recruiting clinicians, but must obtain consent from clinicians and participants before publishing detailed individual phenotypic data. Limited engagement by recruiting clinicians at best restricts, but may even prevent, the publication of findings, a major driver of research activity. Furthermore, researchers are unable to assess detailed phenotyping data or to obtain additional clinical samples from patients or relatives that could help segregation testing or functional analyses of variants. These issues limit researchers' opportunities to interpret the pathogenicity of variants, further reducing opportunities to benefit patients by making a definitive molecular diagnosis, and to publish. During the period 2016–2018, many clinicians were encouraged to recruit to this project in preference to local clinical exome screening on the basis that it was a more comprehensive test. Screening to date has fallen well short of that promise, and despite the predicted 1 to 2-year turnaround, reports have still not been issued for some patients. Nevertheless, the 100K dataset remains a powerful resource of immense value to patients, clinicians and researchers, both in the UK and globally. Whole genome sequence data can be revisited indefinitely, reducing the need for expensive and sometimes invasive serial tests frequently required in the \"diagnostic odyssey\" for patients with genetic diseases. We suggest that a more agnostic approach to gene panel selection, like that used by the Deciphering Developmental Disorders project, rather than one driven narrowly by HPO term usage, would be beneficial. This approach would permit analysis of additional panels of genes with broadly overlapping phenotype ranges if an answer is not obtained from the relevant PanelApp gene panel, or if phenotyping data are not well documented. Reanalysis should also include approaches to identify variants likely to alter splicing and likely pathogenic structural variants, for example using SpliceAI and the SVRare suite of programs (Yu et al., 2021). This broader approach could identify \"second hits\" in relevant genes that appear to be monoallelic for tiered variants, and remain refractory to current strategies. Additionally, increasing accessibility for research teams around the world and reporting of new research-based findings could reap further benefits for patients and clinicians. Updating the security software could make it easier to access and use, especially for research-minded clinicians, without compromising security risks. To derive maximum benefit from these efforts, lines of communication between researchers and clinicians should be improved. This may require an overhaul and update of the database of recruiting clinician contact details held by GEL, with new contacts established when clinical responsibility changes hands. In our experience, when the recruiting clinician did respond, the information they supplied proved invaluable in confirming molecular diagnoses. Often, many additional clinical features which had not been listed in the entered HPO terms were provided, which facilitated more accurate genotype-phenotype correlation and greater diagnostic confidence. All new findings, whether generated through reanalysis by GEL or by researchers applying domain-specific knowledge, would still need accredited diagnostic confirmation, so additional staff and resources for service testing are also essential. As well as addressing issues within the existing study, the experience of those involved in 100K can inform future large-scale human genomics studies. The use of HPO terms to describe and define phenotypes, if applied effectively, could facilitate an AI-based, phenotype-informed variant prioritization approach. A simple, comprehensively applied HPO term entry system could significantly enhance the value of any future human genome resource. In summary, the ciliopathies provide an exemplar group of disorders that illustrate both the challenges and opportunities of working with 100K datasets (Best et al., 2021; Wheway et al., 2019). 100K remains an immensely valuable clinical and scientific resource with huge potential for patient benefit, but that benefit has not yet been fully realized. There is an urgent need for re-evaluation of the data in light of improvements in genome interpretation technologies. Additional understanding could also be gained from research activity, which would benefit from efforts to simplify access, and train and support more researchers in using the data.

Through an international collaboration, four individuals (three males and one female) carrying CENPF biallelic variants, including two missense variants in homozygous state and four LoF variants, were identified by exome sequencing. All individuals had variable degree of developmental delay/intellectual disability and microcephaly (ranging from -2.9 SDS to -5.6 SDS) and a recognizable pattern of dysmorphic facial features including inverted-V shaped interrupted eyebrows, epicanthal fold, depressed nasal bridge, and pointed chin. Although one of the cases had duodenal atresia, all four individuals did not have the combination of internal organ malformations of Strømme syndrome (intestinal atresia and anterior eye segment abnormalities). Immunofluorescence analysis on skin fibroblasts on one of the four cases with the antibody for ARL13B that decorates primary cilia revealed shorter primary cilia that are consistent with a ciliary defect. This case-series of individuals with biallelic CENPF variants suggests the spectrum of clinical manifestations of the disorder that may be related to CENPF variants is broad and can include phenotypes lacking the cardinal features of Strømme syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Noonan syndrome (NS) is a clinical variable multisystem disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the RAS/mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling pathway. NS is characterized by a distinctive facies, short stature, and congenital heart defects. Psychomotor delay, learning difficulties, and social deficits are also common. Furthermore, behavioral and attention problems can be reckoned as a key symptom in NS, with functioning resembling the patterns observed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The complex behavioral phenotype has great impact on the quality of life and raises demanding management issues also for patients' families. Parent management training (PMT) is recommended as first‐line treatment for ADHD; however, no study has been performed to test the efficacy of PMT in NS, thus far. The aim of this pilot study is the implementation and evaluation of a PMT dedicated to NS families. Parents of seven children with NS were recruited and underwent to a 10‐session PMT. Three different questionnaires were administered to both parents: Conners Parent Rating Scales, Parenting Stress Index Short Form (PSI‐SF), and Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ). Our findings on this first small cohort of families indicate that positive perception and satisfaction about the child and the interaction with him increased in mothers after the intervention, as measured respectively by PSI‐SF difficult child (DC) and PSI‐SF parent–child dysfunctional interaction (PCDI), while mothers' level of stress decreased after the PMT, as indicated by PSI‐SF total scores. Furthermore, APQ positive parenting, which measures behaviors of positive relationship with the child, increased in mothers after the intervention. Statistical analysis on fathers' questionnaires did not show significant differences after the PMT sessions. This pilot study suggests that PMT is a promising intervention for parents of NS children with behavioral and ADHD symptoms. Changes in mothers' attitudes and distress indicate that behaviorally oriented programs may help parents to manage with NS phenotype.",

In the medical literature, most reported patients are children, and data is lacking on the natural history of the condition across the lifespan, with little known about adult-specific presentations and symptoms. Here, we report the results of a retrospective chart review of eight adult patients with Kabuki syndrome, seven of whom are molecularly confirmed. We use their trajectories to highlight the diagnostic challenges unique to an adult population, expand on neurodevelopmental/psychiatric phenotypes across the lifespan, and describe adult-onset medical complications, including a potential cancer risk and unusual and striking premature/accelerated aging phenotype.",

Given that most clinical genetic resources focus on populations of European descent, we compare craniofacial features in genetic syndromes across different populations and review how machine learning algorithms perform on diagnosing genetic syndromes in geographically and ethnically diverse populations. We also discuss the value of populations from ancestrally diverse backgrounds in the training set of machine learning algorithms. Finally, this review demonstrates that across diverse population groups, machine learning models have outstanding accuracy as supported by the area under the curve values greater than 0.9. Artificial intelligence is only in its infancy in the diagnosis of rare disease in diverse populations and will become more accurate as larger and more diverse training sets, including a wider spectrum of ages, particularly infants, are studied.",

Overall, 146 genetic tests in addition to routine chromosome analysis were performed on 92 individuals with DS. Tests included chromosomal microarray, gene panels, and whole exome sequencing. Tests were performed for the indication of: autism spectrum disorder, celiac disease, dementia, hematologic diseases, and others. Eleven individuals with DS were found to have a second genetic diagnosis. Individuals with DS in one multidisciplinary clinic for DS had a variety of genetic tests beyond chromosomes completed, for varied indications, and with some abnormal results leading to additional diagnoses. Additional genetic testing beyond chromosome analysis is a reasonable consideration for patients with DS who have features suggestive of a secondary diagnosis.",

People with intellectual disabilities had a higher risk of both diagnosis and mortality from coronavirus infections (COVID‐19) than the general population. Clinicians and disability advocates raised concerns that bias, diagnostic overshadowing, and ableism could impact the allocation of code status and treatment options, for patients with intellectual disabilities, including Down syndrome (DS). To study this, retrospective claims data from the Vizient® Clinical Data Base (used with permission of Vizient, all rights reserved.) of inpatient encounters with pneumonia (PNA) and/or COVID‐19 at 825 hospitals from January 2019 to June 2022 were included. Claims data was analyzed for risk of mortality and risk of “Do Not Resuscitate” (DNR) status upon admission, considering patient age, admission source, Elixhauser comorbidities (excluding behavioral health), and DS. Logistic regression models with backward selection were created. In total, 1,739,549 inpatient encounters with diagnoses of COVID‐19, PNA, or both were included. After controlling for other risk factors, a person with a diagnosis of DS and a diagnosis of COVID‐19 PNA had 6.321 odds ratio of having a DNR status ordered at admission to the hospital compared with those with COVID‐19 PNA without DS. The diagnosis of DS had the strongest association with DNR status after controlling for other risk factors. Open and honest discussions among healthcare professionals to foster equitable approaches to EOL care and code status are needed.",

Researchers consider religiosity and spirituality (RS) to be positive coping mechanisms associated with reduced psychological distress. Relatively little is known about the impact of RS on genomic health issues. The objectives of our study were: (1) describe the prevalence of RS and depressive symptoms and (2) explore how RS relates to psychological distress in a cohort of individuals with a > or =25% prior probability of a genetic predisposition to cancer. Participants (n = 99) were drawn from an African-American, Louisiana-based kindred with a mutation at the BRCA1 locus. This analysis reports findings from a survey assessing RS and the use of three types of religious coping styles: collaborative, self-directing, and deferring. Clinically significant depressive symptoms were relatively high (27%); with females (33%) more likely than males (17%) to report symptoms (P < 0.01). The majority of participants reported being highly religious. The most commonly employed religious problem solving style used by participants was collaborative (X=22.9; SD=5.8) versus self-directing (X=12.8; SD = 5.1) and deferring (X=19.9; SD = 6.3). We did not observe significant associations between RS indicators and psychological distress, nor did we observe appreciable differences related to gender or risk perception. Although RS beliefs and practices are important for many African-Americans, we did not find evidence that indicators of self-reported RS are associated with psychological distress prior to genetic counseling and testing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Quality improvement in specialist services such as clinical genetics is challenging largely due to the complexity of the service and the difficulty in obtaining accurate, reproducible, and measurable data. The objectives were to evaluate the pattern of referrals to the All Wales Medical Genetics Service (AWMGS) North Wales Genetics team based in three separate hospitals, define the capacity of the team and implement change to improve equity, timeliness and efficiency of care delivery to patients. The methodology required collating the monthly referral rates retrospectively for each center over a 2.5‐year period and plotting on statistical process control charts. Process mapping of the referral process in each center was undertaken, differences documented and a common pathway implemented. “Did not attend” and “time to first appointment” rates were also measured in one center. PDSA methodology was used to implement “patient focused booking.” The results show that the range for referral rates in any given month for each center was 3–33 referrals. The range for referral rate for the whole team was 18–64 per month. Since January 2004 the average number of monthly referrals to the North Wales service has increased by 50%. The potential range in monthly referrals varies between centers and the range of the variability has also increased also in two out of the three centers. Introduction of Patient Focused Booking reduced the “Failed to Attend” rate and 100% of patients were offered a choice of appointments. In addition 100% had a first face‐to‐face contact within 6 weeks if they chose. The measurement of improvement involved firstly introducing a series of continuous measures to provide a baseline for the process prior to the implementation of any changes and secondly to indicate the impact of the changes following implementation. The measures implemented included process (referrals numbers, percentage of patients offered a choice of appointments), outcome (percentage of patients seen within 6 weeks and the percentage failing to attend), and balancing measures (percentage declining the service or failing to respond). It was concluded that general tools of quality improvement can be used to good effect within specialist services. Good processes and accurate, reproducible and measurable data are essential. Small changes can have a major impact both on the quality of the service offered and the ability to deliver the service. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Nablus syndrome was first described by the late Ahmad Teebi in 2000, and 13 individuals have been reported to date. Nablus syndrome can be clinically diagnosed based on striking facial features, including tight glistening skin with reduced facial expression, blepharophimosis, telecanthus, bulky nasal tip, abnormal external ear architecture, upswept frontal hairline, and sparse eyebrows. However, the precise genetic etiology for this rare condition remains elusive. Comparative microarray analyses of individuals with Nablus syndrome (including two mother–son pairs) reveal an overlapping 8q22.1 microdeletion, with a minimal critical region of 1.84 Mb (94.43–96.27 Mb). Whereas this deletion is present in all affected individuals, 13 individuals without Nablus syndrome (including two mother–child pairs) also have the 8q22.1 microdeletion that partially or fully overlaps the minimal critical region. Thus, the 8q22.1 microdeletion is necessary but not sufficient to cause the clinical features characteristic of Nablus syndrome. We discuss possible explanations for Nablus syndrome, including one-locus, two-locus, epigenetic, and environmental mechanisms. We performed exome sequencing for five individuals with Nablus syndrome. Although we failed to identify any deleterious rare coding variants in the critical region that were shared between individuals, we did identify one common SNP in an intronic region that was shared. Clearly, unraveling the genetic mechanism(s) of Nablus syndrome will require additional investigation, including genomic and RNA sequencing of a larger cohort of affected individuals. If successful, it will provide important insights into fundamental concepts such as variable expressivity, incomplete penetrance, and complex disease relevant to both Mendelian and non-Mendelian disorders.",

In our cohort, all patients had a positive CHD7 mutation, in addition to a clinical diagnosis. 19.4% (13/67) of CHARGE patients did not have a coloboma in either eye. 69.2% (9/13) had strabismus, 76.9% (10/13) had a refractive error that warranted refractive correction, 23.1% (3/13) had amblyopia, 38.5% (5/13) had nasolacrimal duct obstruction, 30.8% (4/13) had dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy, 15.4% (2/13) had ptosis, 15.4% (2/13) had blepharitis, 15.4% (2/13) had Cortical Visual Impairment, 7.7% (1/13) of patients had optic nerve drusen, 7.7% (1/13) had Marcus Gunn Jaw Winking, and 7.7% (1/13) with an eyelid nevus. There are numerous ophthalmic findings in individuals with CHARGE Syndrome without colobomas. No study to date has evaluated the ophthalmic findings in CHD7 positive CHARGE patients without colobomas. These findings need to be assessed and treated to ensure optimal vision in the CHARGE patient population.

We discuss evolutionary contexts that modulate this variability and hypotheses postulated to explain them; for example, a small amount of melanin in the skin facilitates vitamin D production, making it advantageous to have fair skin in an environment with little radiation incidence. In contrast, more melanin protects folate from degradation in an environment with a high incidence of radiation. Some Native American populations have a skin color at odds with what would be expected for the amount of radiation in the environment in which they live, a finding challenging the so‐called “vitamin D–folate hypothesis.” Since food is also a source of vitamin D, dietary habits should also be considered. Here we argue that a gene network approach provides tools to explain this phenomenon since it indicates potential alleles co‐evolving in a compensatory way. We identified alleles of the vitamin D metabolism and pigmentation pathways segregated together, but in different proportions, in agriculturalists and hunter‐gatherers. Finally, we highlight how an evolutionary approach can be useful to understand current topics of medical interest.",

Different forms of conjoined twinning are observed with the thoracopagus form being the most common. The rate of conjoined twinning is similar across all major populations. A dramatic malformation of this type would be an extraordinary occurrence leading people to reflect on the spiritual or supernatural nature of such an event. Therefore, it is not surprising that artifacts that seem to depict different forms of conjoined twins are seen across diverse cultures. In this article, we present a survey of these cultural artifacts including anatomic classification based on external anatomy and an exploration of the cultural and spiritual contexts associated with the artifacts. A key finding is that the most common form of conjoined twinning in the artifacts is parapagus (both dicephalus and diprosopus) in contrast to thoracopagus, the most common form in epidemiologic studies. Potential reasons for this difference are discussed. Evidence is presented to support the speculation that these objects represent artistic impressions of actual conjoined twinning events.",

A series of 65 patients were examined prospectively-26 with hEDS, and 39 subjects with chronic neck, knee, or back pain without hEDS. The deep fascia of the sternocleidomastoid, iliotibial tract, and iliac fascia were examined with B-mode ultrasound and strain elastography, and the thicknesses were measured. Stiffness (strain index) was measured semi-quantitatively using elastography comparing fascia to muscle. Differences between groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. hEDS subjects had a higher mean thickness in the deep fascia of the sternocleidomastoid compared with non-hEDS subjects. There was no significant difference in thickness of the iliac fascia and iliotibial tract between groups. Non-hEDS subjects with pain had a higher strain index (more softening of the fascia with relative stiffening of the muscle) compared with hEDS subjects and non-hEDS subjects without back or knee pain. In myofascial pain, softening of the fascia may occur from increase in extracellular matrix content and relative increase in stiffness of the muscle; this change is not as pronounced in hEDS.",

In addition, having a known diagnosis allows anticipatory planning, resulting in lower morbidity from hemorrhage and tissue injury. With continued progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms of EDS, more effective treatments can be developed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Congenital heart disease (CHD) is common, costly, and critical. Approximately half of all infant deaths due to congenital anomalies are associated with CHD or neural tube defects. As infant mortality improves due to better infection control and peripartum care, congenital anomalies are becoming a key driver of pediatric survival and health. Improving CHD prevention and care globally will play a significant role toward key goals such as United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs) of good health and well‐being (SDG 3) and reduced inequalities (SDG 10). This review addresses two questions: how can we reinterpret and reframe available data on CHD to spur action in prevention and care? How can we re‐engineer how we currently track CHD in populations to efficiently generate new data to assess successes and detect gaps in prevention and care? Answering these questions requires understanding the causal chain of disease, from cause to CHD occurrence to health outcomes. This perspective provides a logical basis for two innovations. First, develop a data‐driven message that reframes epidemiologic and clinical data in terms of incentives for action, evidence for change, and strategies for population‐wide impact. Second, through partnerships between clinical and public health systems, implement an integrated “triple surveillance,” which, in the same population, concurrently tracks the three elements of the causal chain—causes, disease occurrence, health outcomes. By streamlining activities and minimizing operational waste, such systems can have a vital role in improving prevention and care on a population level, including in many low and middle‐income countries.",

In symptomatic carriers (SCs) we explored Lyonization to explain their symtomatology. From a DNA‐Bank of 3,000 samples, intragenic restriction fragment length (RFLPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs) of F8/F9 genes were assessed by PCR‐PAGE and GeneScan. In SHA patients, F8 inversions were detected by inverse shifting‐PCR/diagnostic and complementary tests. In SCs, we evaluated hemorrhagic symptoms, clotting FVIII/FIX and X‐chromosome inactivation (XCI) patterns were assessed by HUMARA assay and the search of XIST promoter pathogenic variants. Informativeness of linkage analysis for HA carrier diagnosis with RFLP's/STR's increased to 74% and reached 80% with five RFLPs for HB. Combined Inv22/Inv1 diagnosed 113 possible carriers, three de novo Inv22‐1, and confirmed 45 mothers as obligate or sporadic carriers. Among 21 SCs, four showed extreme skewed XCI pattern (~80:20) but had normal karyotype and no C43G pathogenic variant in XIST promoter. Clotting FVIII/FIX correlated with the active X in leukocytes. Our data integrate the largest comprehensive research worldwide on the molecular diagnosis of HA and HB carriers in terms of the number of studied and diagnosed cases, in addition to the genetic analysis in SCs. Intragenic RFLPs and STRs of F8/F9 genes along with F8 int22h/int1h inversions in SHA emerge as optimal variants for molecular diagnosis in Mexican population. In counseling SCs, inheritance of skewed X‐inactivation should be considered.",

They interweave several important strands related to human growth: that of individuals born with some form of intellectual impairment or disability (ID); second, the genetics associated with intellectual ability and disability; and third, at the behavioral level, the dynamic expression and variability of specific abnormalities as individuals age. ID, and the genetic disorders that produce ID, were often not well‐received by earlier societies. While the inheritance of behavior and intellectual ability has probably been observed throughout human history, the systematic investigation of the inheritance of intellectual ability probably begins with Sir Francis Galton, in his treatise Hereditary Genius in 1869. The dynamic features of ID have its roots in late 19th century developmental psychology and early 20th century pediatrics. Alfred Binet, along with his colleague Theodore Simon, created the first methods of formal intelligence testing of children for the French school system. Scores based on the items administered would then be used to distinguish children who were prepared for enrollment in a standard educational program from those who were not.

We evaluated 138,560 newborn screening (NBS) samples (between 125,000 and 130,000 children) and used the CLIR result interpretation guidelines to stratify results. Children at higher risk of having a PUCD received follow‐up services including confirmatory lab testing (ammonia, plasma amino acids, urine orotic acid) or a repeat NBS sample. We made multiple adjustments to our CLIR PUCD tool and to our follow‐up algorithms in order to reduce false positives. Regardless, a high number of NBS samples resulted with false positives in part due to the glutamine peak also containing lysine. No children were diagnosed with a PUCD during our study period, and the Emory Genetics Metabolic Center is unaware of any children diagnosed outside of the NBS system during that time. Based on our experience, PUCD is not suitable for statewide NBS using Neobase2 and CLIR. Other methodologies that can separate glutamine from other amino acids may have better performance.",

A total of 28 patients had both genetic diagnosis and histologic results (n = 1 nephrectomy, n = 27 biopsy). We collected clinical, renal biopsy findings, and genetic information. The relationship between the histologic findings and the genetic diagnoses was classified as: concordant, nonspecific, and discordant. A total of 15 males and 13 females were included (mean age = 9.6 years). Clinical suspicion of Alport syndrome was the most common reason for referral (n = 11, 39.3%), followed by nephrotic syndrome (n = 8, 28.5%), \"other\" (n = 6, 21.4%), cystic kidney disease (n = 1, 3.6%), isolated hematuria (n = 1, 3.6%), and non-nephrotic proteinuria (n = 1, 3.6%). The overall concordance rate between renal histologic and genetic diagnoses was 71.4% (20/28), nonspecific biopsy results were observed in 17.9% (5/28), and discordant results were observed in 10.7% (3/28). All patients referred for suspected Alport Syndrome had pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in one of the COL4A genes. Two cases of Lowe syndrome and one of PAX2-associated nephropathy had discordant histology findings. Agreement between renal histologic findings and genetic results varies based on the reason for referral. There was a complete agreement for patients referred for Alport Syndrome; However, there were examples that renal biopsy showed secondary findings that were not specifically associated with the underlying genetic results.",

Among those, Lujan-Fryns, an X-linked genetic disorder associated with variants in MED12 was the first such syndrome identified. Accurate molecular diagnosis for these MHID syndromes remains a challenge due to significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. We present a case report of a 20-year-old male patient with MHID and severe social anxiety. A comprehensive clinical evaluation, including morphotype assessment, cognitive, and psychometric and genetic testing, was conducted to provide a detailed understanding of the patient's complex clinical presentation. Psychometric assessments revealed severe social anxiety and various cognitive and emotional challenges. Despite some autism-like symptoms, the patient's clinical presentation was more aligned with mild intellectual disability. Exome sequencing was inconclusive but identified a heterozygous de novo missense variant in the PCDHGA5 gene. This gene is not known in human pathology yet, but we also report a second patient with a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and a rare de novo variant which leads us to propose this as a candidate gene. Our findings emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis and management of MHID. This case report underscores the need for objective clinical evaluations and standardized tools to better understand the complex clinical profiles of patients with NDDs. The identification of novel PCDHGA5 gene variants adds this gene's candidacy to the genetic landscape of MHID-NDD, warranting further investigation to determine its potential contribution.",

The clinical spectrum is broad, ranging from mild manifestations in both males and females to multiple malformations and neonatal death in the more severely affected cases. An increased risk of neoplasia is reported, requiring periodical surveillance. Intellectual development is normal in most cases. SGBS is caused by a loss‐of‐function mutation of the GPC3 gene, either deletions or point mutations, distributed all over the gene. Notably, GPC3 deletion/point mutations are not found in a significant proportion of clinically diagnosed SGBS cases. The protein product GPC3 is a glypican functioning as a receptor for Hh at the cell surface, involved in the Hh‐Ptc‐Smo signaling pathway, a regulator of cellular growth.",

    "abstract": "This issue of the journal is on fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The first research data on the adverse outcomes from prenatal alcohol exposure in humans were published in England and Scotland in the 1890s [Sullivan, 1899; Templeman, 1892]. These data were subsequently ignored for nearly 70 years. In 1957, Rouquette and then in 1960, Lemoine [2003] published papers on the adverse outcomes in children with prenatal alcohol exposure from France. Prenatal alcohol exposure was then again brought to our attention by the work of Ken Jones and David Smith in 1973 when they coined the term fetal alcohol syndrome [Jones and Smith, 1973]. In the seven articles in this issue of the journal, the authors provide a status report on many of the most crucial issues on FAS. Floyd and Sidhu [2004] present a paper reviewing data from the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other risk factor surveillance systems on the number of women using alcohol during pregnancy. This work is an important initial step in what must occur in this area. We need to begin to view alcohol use as a prenatal risk marker before, during, and after pregnancy. Alcohol use prior to pregnancy leads to exposure in large numbers of pregnancies before women know they are pregnant. Pregnancy is not an ideal time to treat alcoholism; beginning routine screening for alcohol use in all women of childbearing age is a superior approach. This screening should also occur after pregnancy. Detection of alcohol abuse here can prevent the adverse outcomes that children experience from being raised in homes with actively alcoholic parents. Routine screening is also a key to prevention of exposure in a subsequent pregnancy. In their paper May et al. [2004] provide information on mothers of children with FAS from the United States and South Africa. The rates of FAS in South Africa are extraordinary. May et al. further the study of the risk marker profiles for FAS in discreet populations, which will be required in order to develop both population and maternal risk phenotypes. These data will allow the delivery of population-specific prevention and risk reduction programs. This tailored approach to prevention will ultimately be the key to prevention of FAS where the highest-risk women are difficult to reach. Stoler and Holmes [2004] present data on early detection of affected infants. This has important implications since early detection can lead to early intervention and identifies a woman at risk of having an affected child in her next pregnancy. If a woman continues to drink, this risk probably exceeds 75% in subsequent pregnancies. Currently our ability to identify affected children in infancy is poor. This program presents data on a system in development that may improve rates of identification of exposed infants before they leave the hospital. This would offer an important window for initiating a treatment program for the mother. This may have very important benefits for the prevention of FAS. Nancy Day [2004] presents a review of growth impairment resulting from prenatal alcohol. She demonstrates that if a safe level of alcohol use during pregnancy exists, it is very low. Her study also contributes to the literature on the complexity of diagnosis using current diagnostic criteria. A large number of children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure do not have severe growth deficits. This is in keeping with the suspicion that most people with adverse outcomes from prenatal alcohol exposure have mild to moderate impairments in growth, few changes in facial features, and an increased prevalence of common neurodevelopmental disorders. If this is so, we need major revisions of the diagnostic criteria for identification of the majority of people with adverse outcomes from prenatal alcohol exposure. In a review of work on imaging studies of the brain and in particular the corpus callosum Riley et al. [2004] examine data on the comparison of size and shape of the corpus callosum in children. They compare children with FAS; children who were exposed to alcohol who have few or no abnormal facial features, and minimal or no growth impairments; and unexposed controls. They have identified size and shape differences in the corpus callosum between these three groups. Currently, the cost and complexity of imaging are substantial and interpretation of the results is not currently widely available. However, in the future Internet-based access may enhance the availability of these complex algorithms for interpretation. Clinicians caring for children with a history of prenatal alcohol exposure may have access to a useful and objective diagnostic tool for assessment. Such a tool may also be of value in evaluating children with learning disorders and children with mental illness or sensory impairment where a history of exposure is not available, and may reduce the need for additional and expensive diagnostic procedures. Few states or countries have specific programs for prevention or treatment of FAS. Lupton et al. [2004] provide data that suggest this may be an error. The cost of FAS can be measured in multiple ways, but no matter how one views the cost data, the picture is alarming. The current estimate of the lifetime cost of care for 2002 is $2.9 million per case. The annual cost of FAS in the United States is $3.6 billion. All states spend millions each year on people with FAS and partial forms of the syndrome. Thus, lack of funding is not and should not be a barrier to development of specific programs for this population. Can a state afford not to devote dedicated resources to a problem of this magnitude that is largely preventable? Mortality is a surprisingly common, but largely understudied outcome of prenatal alcohol exposure. Mortality is increased due to fetal death, stillbirths, birth defects, neonatal deaths, infant mortality and childhood deaths. Prenatal alcohol exposure appears to be a risk marker for mortality for all family members except fathers, where we have no population-based data [Burd and Wilson, 2004]. Alcohol use should be considered a potential contributor in all cases of fetal, infant, and child death. This includes fetuses, infants, and children who are exposed even if they have a diagnosis of another syndrome, metabolic disorder, or genetic defect. Alcohol can adversely affect any child who is exposed. Having another diagnosis is not protective and should not exclude a child from an additional diagnosis of FAS, if warranted by history or findings. If current prevalence rates are accurate, every year 39,000 to 40,000 infants in the United States are born with birth defects, learning disorders, mental retardation, mental disorders, or sensory impairments from prenatal alcohol exposure. This presents a high burden for families, service providers, and affected people, who often receive less than adequate intervention. This is a daily toll of 109 babies and families left with a lifelong struggle. It seems unlikely that even 10% are currently diagnosed. For the other 90% (or more) of adults and children who are undiagnosed or incorrectly diagnosed we hope this issue will contribute to the improvement of this difficult situation.",

The information was taken from the surveillance programs that have an active hospital system in some institutions of the city (ECLAMC modality), and use data from the passive national system (Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia en Salud Pública - SIVIGILA) to expand their coverage. From 2002 until 2019, 1,289.650 births have been monitored through one of the surveillance programs, including both methodologies. The importance of surveillance programs relies on the amount of data obtained that allows the development of research, the detection of potential changes throughout time, and the guidance of public policies to improve promotion and prevention strategies.",

Medically, asymmetry can be congenital or acquired. Symbolically, it has varied connotations from playfulness and complexity to despair and corruption. In Chinese opera, stylized make‐up exaggerates the features, and aspects of the “mask” indicate qualities of the character. The asymmetric faces belong to characters who are corrupt, devious, or evil. In the Dan culture of western Africa, performance masks channel spirits in the community. A spirit with asymmetric facial mask exemplifies ugliness and moral failing. The Nasca culture of South America made generic figures of farmers, deities, and so on, but not of individuals. However, there is evidence of mutual influence between the Nasca and the Wari, with whom they traded. A clay figure apparently representing an individual, or at least a very specific recognized persona, is a ball player with facial asymmetry presumably due to injury. Here the message is one of fierceness and strength. The relative rarity of asymmetric facial depictions compared to symmetric ones is cross‐cultural. This implies that asymmetry is special somehow, in all connotations of that term.",

Contrary to existing research, there were minimal differences between racial groups. We did, however, observe two patterns in that data that are worthy of discussion. First, because participants were from the south, the finding that participants from both racial groups ascribe to a religious belief system to make sense of their lived experiences is not surprising. Rather, it appears to be reflective of the religious culture that is an integral part of the south and our identity as a nation. A second noteworthy finding is that while a significant number of participants believe that a relationship exists between health status, genes, and religious behaviors, they also recognize that positive health behaviors must also be adopted as a means for staving off disease. In some cases, however, there was a belief that health issues could dissolve or disappear as a result of certain religious behaviors such as prayer. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Collaboratively it was possible to elucidate the genetic nature of his unprecedented chromosome rearrangement and its developmental effects in mother and son. In retrospect, these clinical and genetic studies at the height of the somatic cell genetics era (Ruddle, Siniscalco, etc.) presented human genetics with a highly productive opportunity to begin gene mapping of autosomes and the X chromosome. The late Victor McKusick considered the discovery of the KOP translocation, as he determined personally in Montana, one of the major transforming events in human genetics. The Perrault syndrome evaluated in two families in Montana and one in Sicily for familial deafness, primary amenorrhea and neurologic impairment (progressive in some), turned out to be heterogeneous. In the “hands” of Dr. M.‐C. King of Seattle four forms of Perrault syndrome have been identified. The autosomal recessive mutation present in the P family studied with Dr. Pallister in Helena, turned out to affect the mitochondrial histidyl tRNA synthetase gene present in prokaryotes, annelids, fungi and mammals, hence, must already have been present in LUCA some 3.8 billion years ago. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Clinically, affected individuals present with generalized joint laxity, limb malalignment, midface hypoplasia, gracile digits, postnatal short stature, and occasionally, tracheolaryngomalacia; additionally, radiological features include severe epi‐metaphyseal abnormalities and slender metacarpals. This report evaluates the progression of SEMDJL2 throughout the life of the oldest individual reported in the literature—a 66‐year‐old man with a pathogenic KIF22 variant (c.443C &gt; T, p.Pro148Leu). The proband developed many of the clinical and radiological alterations consistent with the presentation of other individuals in the literature. Interestingly, throughout his life, joint limitation progressed, beginning with knee and elbow stricture (year 20), and later, limitation of the shoulders, hips, ankles, and wrists (year 40). This differs from previous case reports, where joint limitation is identified in 1‐to‐2 joints. Cumulatively, the progressive body‐wide joint limitation resulted in early retirement (year 45) and difficulty completing daily tasks and managing personal hygiene culminating in the need for assisted living (year 65). In conclusion, we report on the clinical and radiological developments of a 66‐year‐old man with SEMDJL2, that developed significant joint limitation in adulthood.",

For designing and testing interventions, it is important to document any differences in sleep architecture in children with DS with and without co‐occurring diagnoses, including neuropsychiatric diagnoses and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital for children and adolescents with DS who underwent polysomnography (PSG) between August 2016 and July 2022. Patient data collected from the electronic medical record included diagnoses, age at PSG, and PSG report. Statistical analysis included unpaired T tests to test hypotheses about differences in sleep architecture within age groups, and differences between children with DS and a co‐occurring diagnosis. One way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance of OSA severity within patients with DS. Results When compared by age group, those with DS had negative changes in sleep architecture (e.g., less sleep and more wake) when compared to normative data. Within this cohort, having a co‐occurring diagnosis of autism resulted in further, negative effects on sleep architecture. 89% of those with DS had diagnosed OSA but only those with severe OSA experienced negative effects on sleep architecture. Conclusion Age is an important covariate when studying the sleep of children with DS and neurotypical children. Studies are needed to test whether minimizing the observed differences in sleep architecture will translate to improved learning, mood, and behavioral outcomes, and how treating OSA affects sleep architecture.",

We measured caregiver‐reported QoL in individuals with DS with a DGBI and compared them to individuals with DS without a DGBI via a cross‐sectional national survey. All measures of QoL were lower in those with DS who meet criteria for a DGBI compared to those with DS without a DGBI. Males and females with DS and at least one DGBI had similar QoL scores. While FC was the most common DGBI seen in individuals with DS, there was no difference in any aspect of QoL in subjects with FC when compared to individuals with other DGBIs. However, all measures of QoL were lower in those with IBS compared to individuals with other DGBIs.

Effects of certain treatments, for instance, lithium, can be predicted from clinical characteristics of patients and their family histories. This led to a suggestion that a treatment response could identify subtypes of bipolar disorder particularly suited for gene‐mapping studies. In this paper we review family and molecular studies of bipolar disorder responsive to lithium, as well as studies aiming to identify polymorphisms associated with the treatment response itself. While molecular genetic research and gene expression studies promise to bring new insights into the pathophysiology of the illness and the nature of treatment response, and thus provide new information for better treatment of bipolar disorder in the future, results from family studies and studies of clinical correlates of treatment response may already be utilized in the management of bipolar disorder. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Positive Exposure, a non‐profit organization founded and directed by former fashion photographer Rick Guidotti and co‐directed by psychiatrist Dr. Diane McLean, uses photography and video interviews to explore the lived experiences of people affected with genetic conditions. Positive Exposure challenges pervasive social biases and stereotypes about genetic variation and strives to broaden and enrich societal perceptions of human beauty and spirit. Presented here are the open‐ended personal reflections completed by four individuals with craniofacial differences recruited from a support group, Inner Faces. These four case studies aim to relay the professional photo‐shoot experiences of people who may be challenged by the stigma associated with craniofacial differences. Questions addressed issues of perceived self‐esteem, stigma, hopefulness, and photography experiences. These personal reflections were gathered 1 year following participation in a Positive Exposure photo‐shoot. Participants described the ways in which the photo‐shoot has been a lasting and life‐promoting experience. In addition, these individuals emphasize the integral and enduring role the photographer, Rick Guidotti, played in their personal awakening. Positive Exposure provided these individuals with renewed identification of both inner and outer sources of beauty. These four case studies suggest that Positive Exposure may serve as a sustainable intervention to bolster self‐esteem and self‐image. Published 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

In this review, we present the results of a comprehensive literature search supporting a wide spectrum of extracephalic manifestations identified in patients with NCNS‐HPE. These manifestations have been described in case reports and in large cohorts of patients with “single‐gene” mutations, suggesting that the NCNS‐HPE phenotype can be more complex than traditionally thought. Likely, a complex network of interacting genetic variants and environmental factors is responsible for these systemic abnormalities that deviate from the usual brain and craniofacial findings in NCNS‐HPE. In addition to the systemic consequences of pituitary dysfunction (as a direct result of brain midline defects), here we describe a number of extracephalic findings of NCNS‐HPE affecting various organ systems. It is our goal to provide a guide of extracephalic features for clinicians given the important clinical implications of these manifestations for the management and care of patients with HPE and their mutation‐positive relatives. The health risks associated with some manifestations (e.g., fatty liver disease) may have historically been neglected in affected families.",

This “universal care” system has contributed to the maintenance of health: the life expectancy at birth was 84 years in 2016, and the infant mortality rate (the number of infants dying before reaching 1 year of age) was 2.0 per 1,000 live births, which is one of the lowest rates in the world. The Japanese government initiated the National Program on Rare and Intractable Diseases in 1972. This program has promoted research and expanded support for patients with rare and intractable diseases. Registered patients are eligible for a subsidy scheme that helps to cover medical care costs. Among the 331 diseases that are currently included in this program, more than half of the diseases are Mendelian disorders. The National Program on Rare and Intractable Diseases has fostered research in medical genetics in Japan and many causative genes for Mendelian diseases have been identified by Japanese geneticists. Recently, the Japanese government has determined to support several genomic medicine initiatives including the undiagnosed disease program (Initiative on Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases) and pathogenic variant databases.",

The process(es) that can lead to cervical hyperextension is/are largely unknown. The outcome is variable from lethal to completely resolve. Individuals with arthrogryposis and in particular with Amyoplasia appear to have an increased frequency of neck, cervical, and spine hyperextension at birth. We present here 41 cases of arthrogryposis (mainly Amyoplasia) with fetal cervical hyperextension. The outlook is surprisingly good if spinal cord trauma does not occur. Ultrasound late in pregnancy when arthrogryposis is recognized prenatally should determine whether cervical hyperextension has developed, so that appropriate preventive measures can be taken.",

In this study, we simulate how genetic screening may be implemented in the military to prevent an SCD endpoint resulting from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We created a logistic regression model to predict variant pathogenicity in the most common HCM associated genes MYH7 and MYBPC3. Model predictions were used in conjunction with the gnomAD database to identify frequencies of pathogenic variants. Extrapolating these variants to a military population, lives saved and cost benefit analyses were conducted for screening for HCM related to pathogenic variants in MYH7 and MYBPC3. Genetic screening for HCM followed by echocardiography in individuals with pathogenic variants is predicted to save an average of 2.9 lives per accession cohort, based on historical cohort sizes, and result in a break‐even cost of ~$7 per test. The false positives, defined as disqualified individuals for military service who do not have HCM, are predicted to be 0 individuals per accession cohort. This study suggests that the main barriers for the implementation of genetic screening for the U.S. military are the low detection rate and variant interpretation.",

These tests have a variable and often limited diagnostic rate depending on the clinical presentation, size of the gene panel and our understanding of the inheritance of the disorder (with examples described in this issue). There are numerous possible explanations for the missing heritability of these cases including undetected variants within the relevant gene (intronic, up/down‐stream and structural variants), variants harbored in genes outside the targeted panel, intergenic variants, variants undetectable by the applied technology, complex/non‐Mendelian inheritance, and nongenetic phenocopies. In this article we further explore and review methods to investigate these sources of missing heritability.",

Symptoms can extend beyond musculoskeletal and include lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). There are no studies exploring parent-perceived quality of life (QoL) in children with LUTD, or strategies used to manage symptoms in this population. Our online cross-sectional survey assessed parents of 6-18-year-olds via two UK charitable organizations. It included the Pediatric Incontinence Questionnaire (PinQ), the Dysfunctional Voiding Symptom Score, and questions exploring treatments and efficacy. Sixty-seven parental questionnaires were analyzed. The majority of children were white females (95%, n = 64). Urgency (97%, n = 65) and enuresis (41.7%, n = 28) were the most frequently reported symptoms. The PinQ questionnaire showed that children were emotionally distressed by LUTD. Twenty-nine parents (43%, n = 29) reported pharmacotherapy as the most effective treatment. Few had accessed other treatments such as physiotherapy (16%, n = 18). Most parents reported that overall treatment did not meet their expectations. This study highlights that parents perceive LUTD as having a great impact on their child's QoL. There is need for education among clinicians about LUTD and hypermobility-related disorders, and for development and evaluation of treatments.",

The goal of this study was to analyze clinical photographs of a cohort of patients with JS to define a list of physical examination features that should prompt investigation for JS. Analysis of photographs from 94 individuals with JS revealed that there is a recognizable pattern of facial features in JS that changes over time as individuals age. Macrocephaly, head tilting even when looking straight ahead, eye movement abnormalities (oculomotor apraxia, nystagmus, strabismus), and ptosis are common in those with JS. Distinctive features in younger children include triangular-shaped open mouth with tongue protrusion; in older children and adults, mandibular prognathia and prominent nasal bridge are common.",

Affected families mainly show autosomal dominant inheritance with markedly reduced penetrance and extremely broad clinical variability even between mutation carriers within the same families. We here present advances in prenatal imaging over the last years, increasing the proportion of individuals with HPE identified prenatally including milder HPE forms and more frequently allowing to detect more severe forms already in early gestation. We report the results of diagnostic genetic testing of 344 unrelated patients for HPE at our lab in Germany since the year 2000, which currently with the application of next generation sequencing (NGS) panel sequencing identifies causal mutations for about 31% (12/38) of unrelated individuals with normal chromosomes when compared to about 15% (46/306) using conventional Sanger sequencing and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). More comprehensive genetic testing by our in house NGS panel sequencing of 10 HPE associated genes (MiSeq™ and NextSeq™500, Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) not only allowed to include genes with smaller contribution to the phenotype, but may also unravel additional low frequency or more common genetic variants potentially contributing to the observed large intrafamiliar variability and may ultimately guide our understanding of the individual clinical manifestation of this complex developmental disorder.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We describe an overgrowth condition associated with X‐linked copy number variation. Three brothers displayed an overgrowth pattern at birth that continued postnatally. Clinical findings included macrocephaly, distinctive facial features, developmental delay and variable clubfoot. Normal fetal growth was noted until the third trimester by Hadlock standards, revealing a late gestational overgrowth pattern. Microarray analysis in the family showed a maternally inherited 680 kb copy number duplication at Xq26.1‐q26.2 in all three brothers. Molecular sequencing for known overgrowth conditions including GPC3 , Sotos 1 ( NSD1 ), Malan ( NFIX ), Perlman ( DIS3L2 ), Weaver ( EZH2 ), Opitz–Kaveggia ( MED12 ) loci were negative. BWS IC1 and IC2 methylation and CDKN1C testing was also negative. Normal IGF1 levels excluded X‐linked acrogiantism. The duplicated region Xq26.1‐q26.2 contained IGSF1 and at least part of the lncRNA FIRRE . IGSF1 , a highly expressed pituitary immunoglobulin superfamily gene, was recently implicated in a genome‐wide association study of canine size. IGSF1 variants were associated with large canine breeds compared to smaller breeds. Our findings support the hypothesis that an X‐linked variant encompassing the IGSF1 region may be associated with body size. Although IGSF1 loss has been noted in human hypothyroidism, this is the first reported phenotype in a family with copy number duplication in the region. Our findings suggest that prenatal evaluation, cross‐species evaluation, Mendelian, and GWAS studies may describe a distinctive familial condition and its corresponding phenotypic features.",

Cognitive and behavioral features were assessed in 50 females ages 12.2 ± 3.6 years using the Behavior Assessment System for Children Second Edition (BASC‐2) and Wechsler Scales of Intelligence. Executive functioning, social skills, and autistic traits were evaluated in a subset. Adaptive functioning was assessed using the BASC‐2 adaptive skills composite score (ASC). Participants were classified as average adaptive skills (ASC T‐score &gt; 40) or deficits (ASC T‐score &lt; 40). Group comparisons were conducted. Multiple linear regression examined which factors contributed to ASC score. Twenty‐eight females (55.6%) had adaptive skills deficits with functional communication being the most commonly affected adaptive domain. The group with ASC in the average range had higher verbal IQ (VIQ) and lower rates of numerous behavioral concerns. Internalizing behavior composite, DSM‐IV inattentive symptoms score, and VIQ were significant predictors of ASC. Prenatally diagnosed females comprised over 70% of those with average adaptive skills. In this study, internalizing behaviors, inattentive ADHD symptoms, and VIQ were associated with poorer adaptive functioning. Early interventions targeting internalizing behaviors, attention/executive functioning, and communication skills may improve adaptive skills and deserve further study.",

Although systems biology approaches integrating multiomics and database information into biological networks have expanded our knowledge of genetic disorders, cytogenomic network-based analysis has rarely been applied to study MSs. In this study, we analyzed data of 28 MSs, using network-based approaches, to investigate the associations between the critical chromosome regions and the respective underlying biological network systems. We identified MSs-associated proteins that were organized in a network of linked modules within the human interactome. Certain MSs formed highly interlinked self-contained disease modules. Furthermore, we observed disease modules involving proteins from other disease groups in the MSs interactome. Moreover, analysis of integrated data from 564 genes located in known chromosomal critical regions, including those contributing to topological parameters, shared pathways, and gene-disease associations, indicated that complex biological systems and cellular networks may underlie many genotype to phenotype associations in MSs. In conclusion, we used a network-based analysis to provide resources that may contribute to better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in MSs.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal diagnosis is largely dependent on invasive testing procedures. Consequently, it has generally been limited to those considered by national convention or reimbursement regulations to be at sufficiently high risk of a specific disorder to warrant the hazards and costs involved. In the past, women were mainly referred because of advanced maternal age, which implies a high risk of chromosomal abnormality, a family history of a Mendelian disorder, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), or a multifactorial abnormality, such as a neural tube defect (NTD). The introduction of routine screening 30 years ago and its gradual expansion over time has radically changed the pattern of referral for invasive testing. Today, the largest group of women referred are those with high chromosomal abnormality risk on the basis of multiple biochemical and ultrasound marker levels. Systematic testing for genetic disorders, using either biochemical markers or DNA analysis, now identifies a large number of carriers. Hence, screening rather than family history has become the main indication for the prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders. Routine biochemical and ultrasound marker determination also leads to the detection of large numbers of structural abnormalities. A single marker, maternal serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) can detect a large proportion of NTDs and abdominal wall defects. A parallel development has been the steady improvement in the ability of imaging techniques to obviate the need for invasive prenatal diagnosis. Many centers with sonographic expertise now rely on ultrasound as opposed to amniocentesis for the diagnosis of fetal NTD. Screening has also benefited from improved imaging with the routine use of ultrasound to detect structural abnormalities. In this issue of Seminars in Medical Genetics, a wide range of new developments are presented relating to both an improved ability to make a prenatal diagnosis and more efficient screening methods which are used to select for prenatal diagnosis. As well as technical advances, the issue covers ethical implications of these new approaches. The public health achievement of reducing the birth prevalence of a serious medical condition has to be considered in the context of attempting to inform choice, when the notion of screening is poorly understood even by professionals. The concept of screening is less well understood than diagnostic testing partly arising from the complexity and indeterminacy of screening compared with the certainty of diagnosis. The use of specialist terminology also stands in the way of understanding. Screening differs from diagnosis in so far as the aim is simply to identify a high-risk group rather than be definitive. But a screening test result is usually classified in a dichotomous way as “positive” or “negative,” and this might be erroneously taken to imply a certainty that is not intended. Typically there is considerable overlap in the distribution of test results between affected and unaffected pregnancies. This is sometimes expressed in terms of false-positive and false-negative results. This time there is a misleading implication of uncertainty. The contributing authors synthesize experience of screening from Europe and Asia as well as North America. In so far as screening is a public health venture with local financial, educational, and technical constraints screening policy will inevitably differ between countries. Nevertheless, the articles here describe the components needed by any screening program and present the policy options. The frequency of aneuploidy and other chromosomal anomalies in pregnancy is high but screening mainly targets those sufficiently viable to survive to term in relatively large numbers and have a severe phenotype. Down syndrome is by far the most frequent, with birth prevalence, in the absence of prenatal diagnosis and therapeutic abortion, of 1–2 per 1,000. Edwards syndrome is 10-fold less frequent at birth and sex chromosome aneuploidies, while common are relatively benign. Although Edwards syndrome is 10-fold less frequent at birth, screening has proven effective for this disorder as well. However, screening programs will not detect other severe, albeit rare, chromosomal defects such as translocations, deletions, and duplications. Nor do such programs target sex chromosome aneuploidies which can be associated with considerable morbidity. In the past, the only way to identify a high-risk group was on the basis of advanced maternal age or previous affected pregnancy. However, this proved to be inadequate since, despite the eight-fold increase in risk between age 30 and 40, most cases occur in young women and under 1% of cases occur in couples with a previous aneuploidy. The advent of screening with multiple biochemical and ultrasound markers has changed the situation radically. Centers implementing screening have experienced a substantial decline in birth prevalence. The article by Spencer describes how multi-marker screening for aneuploidy has evolved from the use of two to four maternal serum markers in the second trimester to the combination of serum and ultrasound markers in the first trimester. This shift in practice has been motivated by increased detection but more so by possibility of earlier reassurance and the ability to offer prenatal diagnosis at a time when termination, if needed, is safer and less psychologically burdensome. The article also considers screening policies using both first and second trimester markers sequentially. The most efficient is “contingent” screening which gives early reassurance to most women because of very low aneuploidy risk, selects a small number for early prenatal diagnosis, including most affected pregnancies, with very high risk, and only measures second trimester markers on a relatively small proportion with borderline risks [Benn et al., 2005]. These moves from second to first trimester screening and the newer sequential policies have the potential to increase Down syndrome detection from about two-thirds to over 90% with a concomitant fall in the number of women needing invasive prenatal diagnosis. These advances are primarily due to the discovery of powerful first trimester ultrasound markers. The article by Sonek describes the first such marker to be widely used, nuchal translucency (NT). When used alone, this marker can detect as many cases of aneuploidy as second trimester multiple serum marker protocols, provided the operator is adequately trained. Biochemical quality control markers are relatively simple by outside agencies through sending “blind” samples for testing. Ultrasound by its very nature is more difficult to quality control. However, there are systems of training and external evaluation for NT in most developed countries and it is essential that operators are registered with such a scheme. Sonek also describes newer highly discriminatory ultrasound markers: nasal bone (NB), tricuspid regurgitation, ductus venosus, and the fronto-maxillary angle. The routine determination of these markers at the time of the NT scan can substantially increase the detection of aneuploidy and reduce the need for prenatal diagnosis. However, the question of quality control looms even larger than for NT, especially in regards to NB which is based on a subjective judgement as to whether the NB is present or not. This consideration suggests a type of contingency test whereby only those with borderline risks on the basis of first trimester serum marker and NT combined are referred to a specialist center for the newer markers [Nicolaides et al., 2005]. More traditional ultrasound markers of aneuploidy, such as nuchal skin-fold thickness and femur length, and structural abnormalities, particularly cardiac defects, may also be an indication for prenatal diagnosis. In many countries, a mid-trimester anomaly scan (“genetic sonogram”) is carried out routinely and many women are categorized as high risk on account of its findings. However, given the widespread availability of screening tests for chromosomal abnormalities earlier in pregnancy, the interpretation of the findings needs to be re-evaluated. Breathnach et al. do this in their article and demonstrate that the optimal use of the information provided by the genetic sonogram is to revise the risk estimate derived from the prior screening. These disorders are much more frequent than chromosomal abnormalities. NTDs are the most frequent in populations of Celtic ancestry—almost 10 per 1,000 in Ireland—but can have birth at a prevalence of as low as 1 per 1,000 (e.g., in Japan). Cardiac abnormalities are common in all populations, and even when only severe cases are considered, requiring hospitalization in the first year of life, the prevalence is about 2 per 1,000 births. Prenatal screening began with the discovery that maternal serum AFP levels were increased on average in pregnancies affected by NTDs. The use of this single marker at 16–18 weeks gestation can detect three-quarters of cases of spina bifida and nine-tenths of fetuses with anencephaly. The spina bifida detection rate is even higher with the mid-trimester anomaly scan and unlike with AFP screening, false-positives are uncommon. Furthermore, with modern ultrasound equipment, even a simple second trimester dating scan will detect all fetuses with anencephaly and a large proportion will be discovered on a first trimester dating scan. The abdominal wall defects incidentally detected by AFP screening for NTDs are also now readily found on routine anomaly scan. In contrast, the ability of the anomaly scan to detect cardiac defects has not met with the same success. While specialist centers are able to detect three-quarters of cases, in practice only one-quarter may be detected prenatally in less expert centers using this method. Appropriate training is critical. While fetal echocardiography is an excellent diagnostic tool in qualified hands, the NT scan may also serve an important role as a screening methodology as increased NT measurement is associated with structural and functional cardiac defects (see the article by Sonek). Thus, once invasive prenatal diagnosis has excluded a chromosomal abnormality there are indications to refer women with a large NT for fetal echocardiology. The article by Allan expands on these issues. Recent technical innovation in imaging, such as three-dimensional ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance imaging are described in the article by Lee and Simpson. They argue that while these techniques will probably have a role in future of prenatal diagnosis, evidence is still limited for a large benefit compared with the standard two-dimensional ultrasound approach which is still the mainstay of fetal anatomy assessment in the first and second trimesters. Over 10,000 human diseases are currently known to be caused by defects in single genes. Disease incidence and gene frequency may vary greatly depending on the specific population group in question. CF is the most common single gene disorder in Caucasian populations with a prevalence of under 0.5 per 1,000 births, while hemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease are the most common genetic disorders worldwide. However, in the United States, the concept of a “melting pot” may have important ramifications for prenatal genetic carrier screening programs, as panethnic testing may prove a more rational approach than targeted ethnic testing. A good family history remains a vital tool for identifying at risk pregnancies. Furthermore, cascade screening, whereby once an obligate carrier is found in an affected unitary family, more and more distant relatives are tested, can help to expand the number of known carriers. However, in terms of public health policy, the most practical approach to identify at risk pregnancies is to routinely test apparently low-risk women (or couples) during early pregnancy. Preconception or prenuptial screening is also feasible in some communities. These methods allow the first birth in an affected family to be prevented, while the traditional method largely prevented recurrence. In their article, Shur and Roe describe the new methods and place them in the context of clinical practice today. They also look to the future and consider both the technical possibilities and practical limitations involved. More disorders are becoming amenable to prenatal carrier detection. For example, in the case of fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of inherited mental disability, virtually all carriers can be detected by a screening. At present, this is only done in Israel and based on this experience, it would appear that such testing may be simple to incorporate into routine practice and is acceptable to women providing adequate counseling and follow-up is available [Song et al., 2003]. The labor intensive nature of cytogenetics means that cost of karyotyping is high and the need to culture amniocytes prior to analysis may result in a 2–3 week turn-round time. Several DNA techniques are now available including FISH, quantitative fluorescence PCR, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization uncultured anmiocytes, which can lead to a more rapid diagnosis. In the case of microarray technology, more information regarding the fetal genotype can be made available to the prospective parents than karyotype alone. In their article, Shaffer and Bui describe and evaluate the potential benefits and problems with each technique. There is no doubt that turn-around is short and results are reliable with FISH, qPCR, and MLPA but few centers are willing to rely solely on the new methods for a definitive report and a full karyotype is still done. As long as karyotyping is still necessary, costs are not significantly reduced. This question turns in part on the value and cost/benefit analysis of detecting relatively small structural rearrangements, balanced translocations, and deletions that might be missed if karyotyping were not done. Certainly, the marginal cost of detecting these additional chromosomal aberrations is very high, given that the major aneuploidies can now be detected using these molecular cytogenetic techniques alone, without additional karyotyping. Some would argue that for women referred for prenatal diagnosis because of high Down syndrome risk following screening only need to be tested for the common aneuploidies as they are not at particularly high risk of other defects. Others will say that having undergone the hazards of an invasive diagnostic procedure the material obtained should be fully evaluated. Microarray technology holds much promise and currently can provide more information than karyotyping alone. However, this method also still poses challenges. As genetic technology rapidly advances, our underlying assumptions regarding our primary approach to prenatal diagnosis may change since molecular cytogenetics will likely become both more comprehensive and cost effective. Fetal nucleated red cells and trophoblasts are known to circulate in small numbers in maternal blood and there is also cell-free DNA of fetal origin. The existence of circulating fetal DNA in most pregnancies can be demonstrated using PCR to amplify Y-chromosome-specific sequences when the fetus is male. In principle, the fetal cells could be used to diagnose aneuploidy and several techniques have been developed to do this. One approach is to increase the relative concentration of fetal cells, by the use of magnetic or fluorescent antibodies or by the physical properties of the different cell types. The next step is to find a few fetal cells, prove that they are fetal, and determine in each the number of copies of common chromosomes. However, the results so far are not sufficiently reliable to replace traditional prenatal diagnosis and the cost is too high for prenatal screening. The use of cell-free DNA appears to have greater potential and this is the subject of the article by Maron and Bianchi. They review in detail the rapid developments in this field, including the lessons learnt about trafficking of DNA and RNA between the maternal and fetal compartments. Applications of this technology are already standard part of clinical practice in some countries. Fetal gender can now be determined with greater reliability and earlier in pregnancy than ultrasound visualization. Fetal RhD status can now be determined in RhD-negative pregnant women who are at risk of Resus Hemolytic Disease. Previously, invasive testing was required together with prophylactic anti-D treatment, which is hazardous and costly. Cell-free DNA can also be used to diagnose or exclude fetal transmission of some Mendelian disorders. However, the use in aneuploidy diagnosis remains elusive, although the quantity of fetal DNA in maternal blood is relatively high in aneuploid so that it might be used as an additional screening marker. Nevertheless, there are new developments within the field, such as the discovery of DNA sequences whose methylation pattern differs between the mother and the placenta [Chim et al., 2005], that may eventually pave the way to this goal. The most difficult aspect of prenatal screening is how to provide sufficient information to allow informed choice and how to help support women while they wrestle with those choices. When prenatal diagnosis was largely limited to older women and those with relevant family histories, this was not such a problem. A small number of specialists, geneticists, and others could handle the face-to-face counseling requirements. But with mass screening it is impractical and expensive to offer this level of service to all women. Instead, high-quality information materials are needed to ease and supplement what face-to-face contact is available. Ideally, women should be provided with multiple sources of screening information: booklets, videos/CDs/DVDs, designated telephone helplines, and Internet sites [Hewison et al., 2001]. In that way, the counseling can be focussed on those with the more critical decisions to make regarding the prenatal diagnosis step and for the very few, termination of pregnancy. The question of informed choice always raises ethical issues. But there are some developments in screening where this is potentially critical. Sharma et al., in their article, consider the timing of disclosure of the estimated Down syndrome risk. This arises from one of the sequential screening protocols, the so-called “Integrated test,” whereby women have both first and second trimester marker determination, but a Down syndrome risk is not disclosed to the patient until the process is complete. Such non-disclosure testing has also been proposed for CF screening where a blood (or mouthwash) sample is taken from both partners and testing is sequential. One sample is tested first and the second is tested if the first is a carrier and the result is only acted on if both partners are carriers. In this approach, the individual is not told their carrier status unless they are one of a carrier couple. And one approach to prenuptial screening for Jewish genetic diseases among the Orthodox has an element of non-disclosure. However, not only do ethical issues arise regarding withholding of information, the opportunity for cascade testing of family members is lost. For choice to be truly “informed,” Sharma et al. contend that all options should be offered, including invasive prenatal diagnosis, which is the only way of ensuring a definitive answer regarding fetal chromosomal abnormalities. When considering this issue, it should be understood that the true hazards of invasive procedures in expert hands are yet to be settled and may be safer than the 1 in 200 fetal loss rate often cited. While controversies remain, with advances in screening and newer genetic technologies, there is general agreement that a policy of selecting women aged 35 or older for prenatal diagnosis is arbitrary and is not a rational use of resources [Berkowitz et al., 2006]. In fact, the most recent Practice Bulletin from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has eliminated the age 35 cut-off and recommends that a choice between screening and invasive testing should be made available to women regardless of age (ACOG bulletin #77, 2067). Ultimately, prenatal genetic care must be provided in the context of not only medical and technologic advances but also sound ethical considerations.",

A major purpose of the symposium was to focus attention on establishing priorities, setting goals, and identifying the steps toward accomplishing those goals. Two major objectives were identified. One is to establish Turner syndrome as a priority area of research for the National Institutes of Health. Turner syndrome should not only be viewed as a rare disorder, but also as a model for common diseases that have a male sex bias in the general population attributable to the lack of a second X chromosome. Barriers to recognition of Turner syndrome as an important area of research were identified, and new approaches to enhancing visibility are discussed. The second major objective is to further development of the Turner Syndrome Research Registry (TSRR). This patient‐powered research registry is a paradigm‐shifting model for how human‐based research can be improved through equal partnerships between researchers and study subjects. The TSRR is founded on an agreement that study participants are the ultimate owners of their personal data. The major challenges to establishing a maximally functional registry of this design were discussed, and a clear path forward was established.",

Although some successes were achieved in combating communicable diseases and improved childhood mortality rates, health systems in Asia are generally characterized by lack of accurate epidemiological information on congenital disorders, lack of human and financial resources, and inadequate focus on public health strategies to ensure targeted interventions, low level knowledge on congenital disorders amongst the community and healthcare providers and the ethical dilemma of managing rare congenital disorders in an environment of low national health expenditures. These bottlenecks must be addressed systematically and interventions such as the use of innovative epidemiological tools to overcome lack of data, increased efforts to standardize rare disease nomenclature and classification and renewed interest in birth defects registries by countries in the region must be considered. Targeted curative and public health approaches currently used in thalassaemia and neural tube defects may be used for other congenital disorders in Asian countries. The implementation of congenital disorders‐related research, prevention, care, and treatment delivery services must be integrated into existing health systems in order to be effective to achieve the targets of SDG2030.",

We can identify three main syndromes with congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis described in Mexico. The first is X‐linked generalized hypertrichosis, an ultra‐rare disease, with few cases reported to date. The second is Cantú syndrome, also known as hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia, which has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and is caused by pathogenic variants in ABCC9 and KCNJ8 . The third is congenital hypertrichosis terminalis with or without gingival hyperplasia, which displays other features and involves several associated genes. The first two syndromes were described by the Mexican geneticist José María Cantú, and the concept of atavistic genes was invoked to explain the emergence of this outstanding trait. By understanding the genetic and pathophysiological basis of hypertrichosis, we can offer effective treatment to patients and help solve esthetic problems related to hair growth.",

She was on treatment since 2 months of age with poor metabolic control prior to her pregnancy (tyrosine 838 ± 106 umol/L). NTBC and a low tyrosine and phenylalanine diet were continued during her pregnancy. She unfortunately suffered from urinary tract infection and anemia during her pregnancy, with median plasma tyrosine and phenylalanine levels of 613 ± 106 umol/L (200-400 umol/L) and 40.2 ± 8 umol/L (35-90 umol/L), respectively. After 40 weeks of gestation, the patient gave birth to a healthy boy, with no adverse effects related to the use of NTBC. The newborn presented with a transitory elevation of plasma tyrosine levels and normal phenylalanine, methionine, and succinylacetone levels. By 12 months of age, the child was determined to have normal psychomotor development. At 20 months old, he was diagnosed with a mild developmental delay; however, global cognitive evaluation with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) test at 5 years old showed normal performance.

In doing so, a wide variety of treatment approaches are explained in this issue, including cell therapy, chromosome therapy, gene therapy, strategies for gene regulation with exon skipping and anti-sense oligonucleotides, stem cell modification and reintroduction, and use of genetic editing tools.

    "abstract": "Abstract Facial recognition technology (FRT) has been adopted as a precision medicine tool. The medical genetics field highlights both the clinical potential and privacy risks of this technology, putting the discipline at the forefront of a new digital privacy debate. Investigating how geneticists perceive the privacy concerns surrounding FRT can help shape the evolution and regulation of the field, and provide lessons for medicine and research more broadly. Five hundred and sixty‐two genetics clinicians and researchers were approached to fill out a survey, 105 responded, and 80% of these completed. The survey consisted of 48 questions covering demographics, relationship to new technologies, views on privacy, views on FRT, and views on regulation. Genetics professionals generally placed a high value on privacy, although specific views differed, were context‐specific, and covaried with demographic factors. Most respondents (88%) agreed that privacy is a basic human right, but only 37% placed greater weight on it than other values such as freedom of speech. Most respondents (80%) supported FRT use in genetics, but not necessarily for broader clinical use. A sizeable percentage (39%) were unaware of FRT's lower accuracy rates in marginalized communities and of the mental health effects of privacy violations (62%), but most (76% and 75%, respectively) expressed concern when informed. Overall, women and those who self‐identified as politically progressive were more concerned about the lower accuracy rates in marginalized groups (88% vs. 64% and 83% vs. 63%, respectively). Younger geneticists were more wary than older geneticists about using FRT in genetics (28% compared to 56% “strongly” supported such use). There was an overall preference for more regulation, but respondents had low confidence in governments' or technology companies' ability to accomplish this. Privacy views are nuanced and context‐dependent. Support for privacy was high but not absolute, and clear deficits existed in awareness of crucial FRT‐related discrimination potential and mental health impacts. Education and professional guidelines may help to evolve views and practices within the field.",

In biallelic phenotypes, such overlaying mosaic involvement may coexist with disseminated mosaicism, for example, in neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis. In other phenotypes, however, classical nonsegmental involvement tends to appear much later, which is why the superimposed mosaic is a heralding feature. In Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (eccrine cylindromatosis), a large pedigree documented a 5-year-old boy with multiple, congenital small eccrine cylindromas along the lines of Blaschko. Disseminated cylindromas were absent because they usually appear in adulthood. ̶ In Hornstein-Knickenberg syndrome, an affected woman had an 8-year-old son with a nevus comedonicus-like lesion exemplifying a forerunner of the syndrome. (\"Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome\" represents a nonsyndromic type of hereditary perifollicular fibromas.) In glomangiomatosis, neonatal superimposed mosaicism is a heralding feature because disseminated lesions appear during puberty or adulthood. Linear porokeratosis is a harbinger of disseminated porokeratosis that develops 30 or 40 years later. ̶ Cases of superimposed linear Darier disease were forerunners of nonsegmental manifestation. ̶ In a case of Hailey-Hailey disease, neonatal mosaic lesions heralded nonsegmental involvement that began 22 years later.",

Physician counseling can provide a supportive environment to encourage modes of physical activity accessible to patients and caregivers. While some adults with Down syndrome have access to a Down syndrome specialty clinic, most are followed only by a primary care physician. This report includes adult patients with Down syndrome followed at a Down syndrome specialty clinic in Boston and compares physical activity assessment and counseling rates by Down syndrome specialists and primary care physicians. Patients were more likely to have physical activity assessment and counseling performed by a Down syndrome specialist than by a primary care physician. A better understanding of the barriers primary care physicians caring for adults with Down syndrome experience related to physical activity counseling could help improve important health habit counseling in this high‐risk population.",

Children with DS have many different inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions that can affect joint mobility leading to arthralgia and altered joint range of motion (ROM), and it is important to have normal reference values for comparison to determine the degree of impairment. The objective of this study was to establish normative joint ROM values, using a standardized measurement approach, for upper and lower joints of healthy children of both genders with DS. This study evaluated joint ROM in healthy males and females with DS who had no previous musculoskeletal pathology. Younger males have more ROM than females at the same age and both genders lose ROM with age but continue to have increased ROM in the ankles compared to children without DS. This study establishes optimal estimates of joint ROM in children with DS, and this information should be helpful to clinicians when assessment requires evaluation of joint ROM to know if evaluation falls within the normal ROM. This reference should be helpful to track joint disease progression over time or as part of a musculoskeletal screen for abnormal joint ROM in children with DS.",

    "abstract": "A first glance at the table of contents of this issue might give the impression that we have chosen a disparate group of conditions to explore. However, we feel that this selection represents several key principles of the field and genetics, as well as medicine in general: these rare disorders need careful delineation and study so as not to be mistakenly lumped and inappropriately treated, molecular origins turn out to be more intricate and beautiful than previously imagined, and only through accurate recording can we move forward. Drs. Terhal and Mortier from the Netherlands and Belgium, together with clinical partners from several countries, have studied a large series of patients with mutations in the COL2A1 gene and elaborated new growth curves for spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia congenital (SEDC) and related collagen 2 disorders. Development of these molecularly based growth curves is a major step forward in the nosography of collagen 2-related dysplasias, one of the largest and most important group of patients in a skeletal dysplasia clinic. Although variability remains significant and points to the multifactorial determination of height even in the presence of a single gene with a major influence, the possibility of comparing the growth chart of a single patient with that of a cohort of patients with similar mutations is a significant improvement over the past and projects us towards the future. It is hoped that similar studies will begin as soon as possible for all other major chondrodysplasia genes allowing the creation of a comprehensive database. In the best of worlds, such a database would include also data on morbidity and complications. The data presented by Drs. Terhal, Mortier and coworkers will undoubtedly constitute an important reference for years to come. The so-called enchondromatoses have been difficult to deal with in many a revision of the Nosology. Are they really “anarchic” development of bone or are they a special type of dysplasia? And what about their inheritance, so many cases being sporadic? Drs. Superti-Furga, Nishimura and Spranger have tried to tackle these questions with the help of recent results that have revealed unexpected molecular mechanisms. They suggest that enchondromas are useful but nonspecific findings and that the molecular bases include both homeostatic defects of bone resorption as well as true dysregulation of cell proliferation. In the latter group, the role of somatic mutations gives a novel twist to the story. The newly proposed classification and the presentation of reference images from molecularly proven individuals will prove to be a helpful companion for the clinician and radiologist. The Paris group led by Dr. Valerie Cormier-Daire contributes two articles illustrating the contribution of the study of genetic disorders to our understanding of skeletal biology and of human growth. In the article on “ciliary” disorders, Drs. Huber and Cormier take us into the world of monocilia, fascinating structures that stand like tall poles on the surface of most cells, including chondrocytes, receiving and transmitting signals—much like the antennas of cellular phones that today line the highways of modern countries—or, like in photoreceptors, carry large stacks of sensory molecules. The high morphologic and functional specialization of cilia is based on a complex transport and assembly apparatus (the intraflagellary transport system, IFT) and mutations in components of this apparatus affect proliferation and differentiation of cells. Based on the current state of knowledge in the skeletal dysplasias and in other ciliary disorders such as the Bardet–Biedl syndrome and the genetic nephropathies, Le Goff and Cormier predict that mutations in many more ciliary genes will be uncovered, and that genotype–phenotype correlations may involve di- or multigenic inheritance. In a further review, Drs. Le Goff and Cormier delineate the current knowledge on TGF signaling and growth disorders and report on the most recent discoveries on the “acromelic” dysplasias. How can single amino acid substitutions in fibrillin results in “opposite” disorders like Marfan syndrome and geleophysic dysplasia? The different effects on TGFβ signaling may be the explanation. The mutations discovered so far in different components of this system (TGFβ itself, its receptors at the cell membrane, the extracellular matrix protein system that binds TGFbeta and modulate its effects, and the intracellular TGFβ signal relay proteins such as the SMADs) reveal an unsuspected role of TGFβ signaling in growth and in the homeostasis of connective tissue. As ongoing studies on Marfan syndrome show, this is a potentially “druggable” system, and a full understanding may one day result in opportunities for novel treatments. Remember the surprise and enthusiasm when, in the mid-80s and 90s, the role of dominant mutations in the collagen 1 genes in producing osteogenesis imperfecta, the brittle bone disease, was identified? Concepts like “protein suicide” and dominant negative took their origin then, and the finding of gonadal and somatic mosaicism responsible for recurrences almost led to forget about the indications of the existence of recessive forms of OI. But the wind has turned, and no less than eight (and possibly more) genes responsible for recessive OI have been identified that not only disclose a complex machinery responsible for collagen assembly and secretion but also point to mechanisms of bone homeostasis that are independent of collagen. Drs. Giunta and Rohrbach from Zurich take us on a tour of these recent discoveries and lead us across the clinical and molecular classification of osteogenesis imperfecta. If the phenotype of fragile bones may have a myriad of different genetic causes, the calcium channel TRPV4 gives us an example of how a single molecule may result in a family of different phenotypes. The breakthrough finding of TRPV as the causative gene of dominant brachyolmia by Dr. Cohn and his colleagues in Los Angeles allowed a rapid series of subsequent articles adding several other disorders to the TRPV4 dysplasia family, including one of the prototypic conditions, metatropic dysplasia. Drs. Nishimura, Lausch, and Unger provide an accurate review of the skeletal phenotypes associated with TRPV4, a still somewhat mysterious molecule the dysfunction of which can produce skeletal or neurologic phenotypes and sometimes a combination of the two. Given that calcium channels are prominent candidates for pharmacologic blockade, some hope for a therapeutic approach in the future may be justified, but as outlined in the review, a more complete understanding of its functional context is needed. The article on the progressive pseudo-rheumatic dysplasia by Dr. Garcia-Segarra and Bonafé from the Lausanne center is a sobering reminder of the fact that the mere identification of a disease gene does not necessarily result in tangible advantage for affected individuals unless efforts are undertaken to explore the pathogenic mechanisms or, at least, to study its presenting signs and symptoms and to remind them to the practicing physicians. If a causative approach to the treatment of PPRD is still lacking over ten years later the discovery of its gene by the Warman group in 1999, the article by Drs. Garcia-Segarra and Bonafé and their coworkers reviews clinical manifestations, radiographic features and molecular findings in the largest PPRD patient series so far and will become an important reference for physicians seeking guidance in the diagnosis of this condition that is still recognized too late. Finally, Dr. Simon and coworkers from different continents present a clinical and pictorial essay on spondylo-megaepiphyseal-metaphyseal dysplasia emphasizing the neurologic complications. Indeed, the cervical spine complications in this dysplasia appear to be frequent and severe, resulting in deformities that are both spectacular on the imaging (kyknodysostosis of the cervical spine) and clinically devastating, as five of six patients reported had clinical spasticity. Awareness about this rare condition and early stabilization of the cervical spine may be important in ameliorating the prognosis in affected children. The AJMG editorial staff, and in particular Dr. John C. Carey, has been encouraging and helped us in any possible way. Our gratitude goes to them. At the end of May 2012, as we were busy in exchanging manuscripts with the Authors and editing them, we were struck by the announcement of the sudden disease of Dr. David L. Rimoin, a pioneer in the field of genetic diseases of bone, a giant of medical genetics, and a mentor and personal friend of many of us. The announcement of his death followed a few days later. The editing deadlines notwithstanding, we had to stop and grieve the loss. Although many in memoriam have already been written and more will follow, it would be impossible to release this volume to the skeletal dysplasia and medical genetics community without expressing our sorrow and grief for the loss of “DLR,” but also our recognition and gratitude for his generosity and the immense impulse and continuing support he has given to the field and to all those who worked with and around him. This special issue is dedicated to him and to his memory. DEDICATION To the memory of Dr. David L. Rimoin 1936–2012",

Perlman syndrome is associated with high neonatal mortality and, survivors have developmental delay and a high risk of Wilms tumor. Recently a Perlman syndrome locus was mapped to chromosome 2q37 and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations were characterized in DIS3L2. The DIS3L2 gene product has ribonuclease activity and homology to the DIS3 component of the RNA exosome. It has been postulated that the clinical features of Perlman syndrome result from disordered RNA metabolism and, though the precise targets of DIS3L2 have yet to be characterized, in cellular models DIS3L2 knockdown is associated with abnormalities of cell growth and division. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The last military dictatorship in Argentina (1976-1983), committed egregious violations of human rights, including torture assassinations and disappearance of 30,000 political dissidents as well as friends and relatives. This included hundreds of pregnant women who were kept in clandestine detention centers and killed after delivering their babies in abject conditions. The succeeding democratic governments applied forensic genetics at the Banco Nacional de Datos Genéticos to identify the estimated 500 children stolen at birth and being reared by military families with suppression of their identity. The first genetic identification was in 1984 of a 6 years old, while the latest was in 2019 of a 44 years old, completing so far 130 identifications along 35 years of post-dictatorship. The ethical, legal, and psycho-social complexities of restoration of genetic identity after years of appropriation and suppression of identity in the Argentine context, is discussed at length. Evidence indicates that after initial psychological distress, most individuals that had their true genetic identity restored experienced relief by learning the truth and reuniting with their biological families. Many \"recovered grandchildren\" are socially and politically involved in progressive causes and express pride for the social activism of their disappeared parents. The role played by genetics in support of the right to identity in Argentina has set an example of social responsibility of science in defense of human rights.",

    "abstract": "Abstract People with skeletal dysplasias have left traces in art and antiquities through ages and cultures worldwide, in Ancient Egypt, Classical Greece, Sub‐Saharan Africa, Asia, and Europe. Such traces record the impact of people with skeletal dysplasia on society and culture—in daily life, religion, and mythology. However, identifying (“diagnosing”) skeletal dysplasia in artifacts and interpreting what such depictions meant within the culture in which they were created is extremely challenging and at times impossible. The objectives of this short and necessarily selective survey are to present a few examples of art through different ages and cultures as a springboard for discussion not only on potential medical diagnoses but also on the lives of people with chondrodysplasia and how they were valued in the society in which they lived. The artifacts were selected from Ancient Egypt, Classical Greece, Mesoamerica (Maya), Sub‐Saharan Africa (Kingdom of Benin), Tang China, and 17th Century Europe. In some cases, surviving artifacts with likely depictions of skeletal dysplasia are few and their cultural context incompletely understood. Nevertheless, certain themes and attitudes seem to repeat across different times and regions, though some cultures, such as those in Ancient Egypt, appeared to have had a comparatively positive view of people with restricted growth and chondrodysplasia.",

    "abstract": "When I was a resident, in one of the largest medical centers in the world, any day I was on inpatient consult service would be a day I exceeded my step goal. Without fail. I'd arrive to the fellows' office early in the morning, spend the next 10–12 h traipsing around multiple different buildings—the children's hospital, the women's hospital, the adult hospital, the other women's hospital, the medical school—before exhaustedly making my way back to the fellows' office to pack up my things, head home to get some precious sleep, then wake up before the sun to do it all over again. Constantly moving, constantly on the go. On consult service as a trainee, my internal pistons fired ceaselessly. Now, as an attending at a different health system, the geographic surface area I cover walking to see consults may be less, but the low-level buzzing in my chest whenever I'm on call persists, and the routine remains the same. I get paged, review the chart, go see the patient, call the team, order testing, write the note, rinse, and repeat. Not long ago, during one of my call weeks, my phone pinged with the unique alert I assigned to our hospital system's internal paging app. A new consult, this time from the pediatric intensive care unit, from which many of our consults originate. I scanned the information provided as my brain began whirring, trying to read, process, and act all at the same time. Baby. Very sick baby. Unclear reason for decompensation. Parents at bedside. Probably needs broad testing with parental samples. As I looked through the chart, gathering background information, I was simultaneously pulling paperwork and educational materials from my desk drawers in preparation for my discussion with the family. At my next break between clinic patients, I briskly walked from my office in the outpatient clinic building, across the big blue skybridge often used as a can't-miss-it landmark on the medical campus, into the main children's hospital. I hopped in the elevator and pressed the button for the ICU, still mentally running through my growing checklist of tasks. When I arrived in front of the correct room, double checking the notes I had scrawled onto a sticky note to confirm, I noticed that this patient had been already been admitted long enough for the nursing staff and child life specialists to have helped his family create a colorful decorative nametag for his door and tape photographs of his cheery face from better times in the skinny window. I took half of a second to look at each photo. It helped ground me in the context of the conversation I was about to have with a worried, hurting, possibly traumatized family. A conversation that I'd had many times before and would have many times to come. Even if you're not the sickest person in the hospital, no one is getting a genetics consult on the best day of their life. A customary knock, then I stepped into the room. The baby appeared far too small to be laying in a standard-sized hospital bed. Pale. Intubated. Not sedated, but very still. So still. I came to the sobering realization that this baby wasn't just sick, wasn't just dying—it seemed like he was already gone. His body was there, but whatever mysterious energy made him the smiling boy in the photos outside his room had left us all behind. Thoughts of my infant daughter came unbidden to my mind. My daughter, who, at my 20-week anatomy scan, was the \"most active baby\" the sonographer had seen in some time. My daughter, whose arms and legs are constantly moving, even while she's sleeping. My daughter, who can never be found in the same spot you left her, even though she can't yet walk. My baby, who is never still. I help take care of sick babies and their families all day long. Confronting illness and mortality is a routine occupational hazard. But something about that baby struck me directly in my heart and in that moment, I shattered. I cleared the distance between the doorway and the hospital bed in just a few strides and scooped that little baby up, holding him against my chest. I swayed slowly on the spot, as if I were trying to soothe him back to sleep. I whispered that he was safe, and that he was so very loved. But of course, I didn't actually do any of that. Because I'm a physician and I need to act like one. Instead, the opening script of my mental teleprompter began to scroll. I introduced myself to the family. I asked about their understanding of why the genetics consult was requested. I confirmed a few details of the baby's history, drew out a comprehensive, three-generation pedigree based on the parents' best memory of aunts, uncles, and grandparents, and explained that I would be examining their baby before looping back to discuss my recommendations for testing. Walking over to the side of the too-big hospital bed, I reached out and stroked the wispy hairs on top of that baby's head, under the legitimate task of checking for skull shape and fontanelle size, but also attempting to impart some warmth and tenderness at the same time. I assessed his facial features, gently turning his head to visualize both ears. I picked up his small hand to examine his palmar creases, his fingers, his fingernails. I gently pressed on his abdomen. Throughout all of this, he never stirred. He never pulled away from me, never reached out to his parents for comfort. Once I had examined him from head to toe, I took a final step away from the bed and turned back toward the family. Automatically, the internal checklist fired up once more. Discuss findings. Review testing options. Shared decision-making. Obtain informed consent. I wrapped up with the family and excused myself from the room. Need to place orders, need to complete paperwork, need to write note. I tucked away the flood of emotions that had rushed through me just moments before, needing to save it for later, when I wasn't so busy. I folded it up and put it away in a storage box somewhere between my chest and my head. Hidden until I had the time to stop and process, if ever. After all, being on service at a tertiary care center, there's always something that needs to be done. It wasn't until weeks later, after several nights of lost sleep and several days of increasing anxiety, that I realized how deceptively permeable that storage box really was. I was in the middle of troubleshooting my recent irritability and feelings of tension with my ever-patient therapist when the memory of that consult unexpectedly jumped to the forefront of my mind. In my surprise, I think I actually paused and voiced, \"Oh.\" And in recounting the story to another person, in saying the words out loud, the box finally burst open. I cried the tears that I had unknowingly been saving for that sweet baby, who had indeed passed away during that hospitalization. I put away my checklists and reminders and took a moment to just be sad. To recognize the impact of the experience had on me. To acknowledge that by doing so, by allowing myself to feel, I was working on source control instead of just symptom management. I was taking some steps to heal. As physicians, we are professionals, it's true. The process of medical training selects for resiliency and endurance, which are certainly helpful traits to have, particularly in subspecialities like mine, where the rare, the unknown, and the presence of many remaining questions are the daily norm. But physicians are also, and at foremost, people. People seek connection with others. People are vulnerable and can get hurt. People need to grieve. I still don't understand why it was this baby, out of all the babies I see at work every day, every week on call, that sent me to a forced system reboot. I'm not sure we can ever predict who those patients will be. But what I do know is that I am grateful for having met him and his family, despite the tragic surrounding circumstances. They reminded me of the normalcy of feeling, reminded me to pause and hold space for my emotions. That I am still a person, even if my process to ensure maximum efficiency on call might seem somewhat machine-like. They reminded me of the importance of being still. The author would like to thank all the patients and families who have shaped her as a physician and a human being.

Here we present eight consanguineous families from Pakistan, five with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and three with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs). Affected individuals were clinically characterized, and genetic variants were identified through exome sequencing (ES), followed by family segregation analysis. Affected individuals in six out of eight families (75%) carried homozygous variants that met ACMG criteria for being pathogenic (in the genes ADGRG1, METTL23, SPG11) or likely pathogenic (in the genes GPAA1, MFN2, SGSH). The remaining two families had homozygous candidate variants in the genes (AP4M1 and FAM126A) associated with phenotypes consistent with their clinical presentations, but the variants did not meet the criteria for pathogenicity and were hence classified as variants of unknown significance. Notably, the variants in ADGRG1, AP4M1, FAM126A, and SGSH did not have prior reports in the literature, demonstrating the importance of including diverse populations in genomic studies. We provide clinical phenotyping along with analyses of ES data that support the utility of ES in making accurate molecular diagnoses in these patients, as well as in unearthing novel variants in known disease-causing genes in underrepresented populations from LMIC.",

    "abstract": "In 1972, I returned from my training to join the faculty and staff at the Children's Hospital in Seattle to establish a Medical Genetics service. A remarkable orthopedist had the far-sighted idea of having an arthrogryposis clinic where all of the specialties came together on the same day, saw 10 to 15 families and then met at the end of the day to share their views. Before that, families would have to go on different days to see different specialists and the specialists never met with each other, although they had access to their different notes. Although such multidisciplinary clinics have become commonplace, this was a revolutionary idea at the time. Given my relative inexperience, I had no idea how revolutionary it was. I was just finding my way as a professional. I had three small children and a physician husband—so as I multitasked, I didn't do a lot of reflection. I was just trying to do my new job. I was the medical geneticist in this multidisciplinary clinic who was meant to be sorting out different types of arthrogryposis. The orthopedist also wanted to produce a book for families on the various aspects of arthrogryposis care (Staheli et al. 1998). I wasn't at all sure I could contribute a chapter on the genetic aspects of arthrogryposis. There were very few women physicians back then. I realize now we were the \"Silent Generation\" and each generation is different. We were called the silent generation because we just put our heads down and focused on what needed to get done. The very first family I saw were monozygotic (MZ) twins where one was affected and the other was not. How could this happen? It seemed unfair and baffling to a geneticist. But it was a harbinger of things to come. Subsequently, I have been in touch with that family over the years as the boys grew up. Both were very smart, although the mother always felt the one with arthrogryposis was the smartest and a problem solver. Both went to university and graduate school. Both ending up in academia in the sciences with faculty appointments. Both married and had children. Their mother was persistently curious about how only one MZ twin could possibly have such a disabling disorder requiring so much special care and attention, but do very well spite of it. Also, of course, she worried, as all families do, about recurrence for both boys and future generations. Fortunately, these were unnecessary worries as no one else in the family has been affected and we have come to learn over the years Amyoplasia does not recur in subsequent generations, but does have higher incidence in one of MZ twins (Hall, Aldinger, and Tanaka 2014). Mom and the boys continue to ask questions every time we were in touch, and they have stimulated my curiosity about how MZ twinning could be discordant, initiating my lifelong interest in the mysteries of MZ twinning (Hall 2021a; Hall 2021b). MZ twins with one affected individual, and their families, have been very important in my journey as a geneticist. Yet the insights have come so slowly as to be frustrating. Back then, after 3 multidisciplinary clinics and 45 families, I realized I had \"not a clue\" about arthrogryposis. So, I hired three medical students for the summer to go to the Shriners Hospital in Spokane and the Shriners Hospital in Portland to find more cases of arthrogryposis. This began a long association with Shriners Hospitals and arthrogryposis. The medical students were bright and it didn't even take the 300 cases of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) they found for them to recognize 3 subgroups: one which the orthopedists call \"classical\" arthrogryposis and we have come to know as Amyoplasia. The second, a heterogeneous group of various kinds of contractures and organ system involvement, and the third with intellectual disability, although at the time they called it \"mental retardation.\" In retrospect, the term was demeaning, but at the time we didn't realize that—it was business as usual. In retrospect, it was remarkable that the chart reviews conducted by myself and those three medical students at the Shriners Hospital and Seattle Children's Hospital never required an ethics review. Now I am regretful and somewhat embarrassed that it was \"business as usual\" and not to have realized what should have happened. There have been many other \"process related\" developments over the last 50 years (all for the good). The landscape of patient care for arthrogryposis and interactions with their families has evolved, and they have taught me so much. Families ask the best questions and I am grateful for these interactions. As a clinician, together with the medical students, we used the 300 cases from Shriners Hospitals to begin to sort out subgroups. Over the years, I have now collected clinical information on over 3000 affected individuals with arthrogryposis and have been able to describe many subgroups (Table 1) (Hall, Reed, and Greene 1982; Hall, Reed, Scott, et al. 1982; Hall and Reed 1982; Hall, Reed, Rosenbaum, et al. 1982; Hall 1984; Rizzo et al. 1993; Shalev, Spiegel, and Hall 2005; Hall 2012a; Hall, Reed, and Driscoll 1983; Hall et al. 1983; Reid et al. 1986; Bevan et al. 2007; Reed et al. 1985; Hennekem, Rotteveel, and Hall 1992; Hall 2009; Nayak et al. 2014; Froster-Iskenius, Waterson, and Hall 1988; Chitayat et al. 1990; Chitayat et al. 1991; Dieterich, Kimber, and Hall 2019; Hall 1996; Hall 2012b; Hall 2012c; Hall 2013; Hall 2014; Hall 2019) on a phenotypic basis. Arthrogryposis is considered a Rare Disease, occurring in around one in 3000–5000 births (Lowry et al. 2010), but it has been a primary focus for me and provided a great deal of satisfaction. Our clinic in Seattle was a magnet for families from around the world seeking expertise about arthrogryposis—its origins, various therapies, and the possibility of genetic recurrence. It was a bit intimidating but also a most amazing opportunity. I became involved in parent support groups all over the world, helping to connect them with each other and share what we were learning. It was very satisfying, because families were so anxious to learn from each other. Helping these families warmed my heart. In the meanwhile, I was multitasking with a growing family and more hospital responsibilities. I just put my head down and worked. The North American parent support group (AMSCI) was inspired and supported by many families and particularly by a very energetic mother of another very smart individual with Amyoplasia. The mother's goal was to try to connect families and their knowledge and experience with each other. She was one of the original organizers of AMCSI and played a crucial role in education and organization. She helped develop guidelines for information sharing and protecting the privacy of affected individuals, produced educational materials such as pamphlets about arthrogryposis and information for parents of affected newborns, and collaborated in creating a foundation. It was so gratifying to be part of these efforts as their medical expert. Early in the development of parent support groups, I got to know this mother because of her passion to share information and her endless curiosity, energy, and questions. She was an inspiration to me as I juggled my own many demands. Most parent support groups of Rare Disorders, including AMCSI, have a yearly conference, often with free registry and travel funds for new families. They also support research and collaboration of all kinds. At these meetings there were endless questions stimulating more research. I would see 30–40 families at a meeting and feel exhausted and frustrated not to have more answers by the end of these meetings. This particular mother lives near the Shriners Hospital in South Carolina, so has encouraged the Shriners system to feel a part of their educational and research efforts. Over the years, the Shriners Hospital has been developing arthrogryposis as a \"special interest\" with a registry of children and youths, and providing genetic studies including whole-genome sequencing for non-Amyoplasia type affected individuals (Dahan-Oliel et al. 2018). The engagement and energy of this mother are inspirational to all that work with her. Over the years, I have learned an enormous amount about her daughter's situation, as well as how different families address challenges in their own way and at different paces. It was humbling to have families share their feelings, experiences, and situations with me. It fills me with joy and frustration at the same time. I often quote the mother when I see families, not usually on their first visit but after getting to know them. I will share with them that she said that having a child with a disability has actually been an enormous blessing to her and her family. They have come to know people they would never have otherwise met. They continue to be inspired by the stories of others. They appreciate their unaffected children in a way they never would have otherwise. Those unaffected children learn about disabilities, kindness, and accessibility. Beginning in the 1990's, the human genome was being sequenced. The genes responsible for various diseases, as well as the pathways involved in cell and organ formation, were being identified. By 2019, 420 genes associated with arthrogryposis had been identified and these were seen to fall into only 16 pathways—nerves, muscle, myelin, various parts of the brain, and spinal cord, and so forth. (Kiefer and Hall 2019). Any mutation/variant that leads to decreased fetal movement may produce contractures by birth. Now there are over 500 specific genes recognized to be related to arthrogryposis, many with several different responsible variants. This has led to recognizing the value of whole genome sequencing in individuals with non-Amyoplasia arthrogryposis, which the Shriners Hospital now perform as part of their childhood registry (Nematollahi et al. 2024). Knowing the specific responsible gene helps predict the natural history even though only a few affected individuals may have been described. This is a shift from emphasis on clinical descriptions (phenotype) to the genotype predicting phenotype. It has been overwhelming for me. I can't keep up with all the new advances and feel inadequate to provide all this new information. Increasingly genetic counseling has shifted from providing options and natural history information to identifying the responsible gene. The last individual I want to mention, I met when she was a patient in my medical genetics clinic in Vancouver while she was in high school. She also has Amyoplasia, but in spite of her limitations of movement, she became very involved in recreational activities in her local park. During college, she began to think about a PhD in rehabilitation medicine. She also had endless questions about why arthrogryposis occurs and because she was doing her PhD at my Children's Hospital, we kept in contact. She helped me understand \"lived experience\" and the daily challenges she faced. Her specialty in rehabilitation medicine became assistive devices. She looked for ways to improve flexibility and mobility for teenagers and adults with arthrogryposis. She has ended up working in the adult spinal cord injury unit and has trained numerous master's degree and PhD students along the way. She makes sure her trainees all learn about arthrogryposis and the potential for assistive devices. They often did research projects to better understand the best care of AMC. Seeing her mature over time warms my heart. She and her husband have become my friends and frequently she gives me advice on assistive devices as my joints age. For many years, she resisted attending the yearly arthrogryposis support group meetings, but finally was invited as a speaker and realized how much she might offer. She began an adult arthrogryposis registry, which has helped to define the natural history into adulthood of various types of arthrogryposis (Sawatzky et al. 2019). Something that was badly needed. What is amazing about her findings is how well adult individuals with arthrogryposis actually do in society. Most have jobs, often are married and support themselves. They contribute to society and provide a better understanding of disabilities. The adult registry also provides information about possible occupations, resources and information for the care of affected adults. It is a joy to have watched this information become available. The International Shriners Hospitals have spearheaded a collaboration of researchers from around the world. Utilizing the latest scoping techniques they collaborate to achieve agreement on definitions, and the items to include under therapeutics and ethical practices (Nematollahi et al. 2024). They have categorized research of all types. It has been a model of collaboration for Rare Disorders, shedding light on processes and achieving new information. Individuals with arthrogryposis and their families are benefiting, as well as the basic science and research in human development. I feel pride in this kind of collaborative development and the generosity of the interactions. Over the last 50 years, many things have changed, from terminology to including affected individuals in the planning of projects. Genetic studies have expanded from pedigree analysis to whole genome sequencing, epigenetics, the control of gene expression, and to transgenerational effects (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease). Differences between different ethnic groups (Silent Generations Project) are also being recognized. And finally, most institutions are recognizing the importance of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility. During the pandemic, we welcomed virtual meetings and presentations. I have learned so many things about arthrogryposis by observation and curiosity. Principles have begun to emerge that allow for better care and understanding. Individuals with arthrogryposis have challenged me and welcomed me. I feel truly privileged to have been a part of their community and perhaps added insights to their corner of medical research. Over the years, my journey with arthrogryposis has been very much a part of my professional and personal life. I wish to acknowledge the support of BCCHF and BCCHRI, the invaluable help of Catherine Wang and the many co-researchers and care providers with which I have worked.

    "abstract": "Abstract Newborn screening (NBS) for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) utilizing T‐cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) has been implemented in all 50 states as of December 2018 and has been transformative for the clinical care of SCID patients. Though having high sensitivity for SCID, NBS‐SCID has low specificity, therefore is able to detect other causes of lymphopenia in newborns including many inborn errors of immunity (IEIs). In a recent study, three of six newborns later diagnosed with Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome were found to have a low TRECs and lymphopenia at birth. This presents an opportunity to increase the detection and diagnosis of WHIM syndrome by NBS‐SCID with immunological follow‐up along with a combination of flow cytometry for immune cell subsets, absolute neutrophil count, and genetic testing, extending beyond the conventional bone marrow studies. Coupled with emerging technologies such as next‐generation sequencing, transcriptomics and proteomics, dried blood spots used in NBS‐SCID will promote earlier detection, diagnosis, and therefore treatment of IEIs such as WHIM syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Abstract LINS1 is the human homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene that encodes an essential regulator of the wingless/Wnt signaling. By 2011, only seven pedigrees (16 patients) with eight causative variants in LINS1 gene have been reported. These cases mainly presented with infancy‐/child‐onset neurodevelopmental disorders, facial dysmorphia, and other clinical features, and a wide spectrum of clinically distinct phenotypes were also manifested. In our study, two brothers in a family were admitted and diagnosed with child‐onset movement disorders, slight intellectual disability, psychological symptoms, eye problems, urinary and bowel dysfunction, mitral value prolapse, and Q‐T prolongation. By exome sequencing, we identified a nonsense homozygous pathogenic variant ( LINS1 : c.274C &gt; T (p.Q92X)), which had been reported in a case diagnosed with intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia and anxiety). Compared with this case, the clinical features of our cases were distinct. In particular, our cases displayed unusual features of heart and blood system. Furthermore, the genotype–phenotype relationship analysis suggested that distinct phenotypes presented in cases carrying variants in different domains of the LINS1 gene. In conclusions, our findings suggest the high clinical variations in the LINS1 variants‐related disorders. Moreover, the Q92X might be a recurrent variant in Hans of Southern China.",

The aim of our study was to characterize a large cohort of individuals with NF‐1 microdeletion syndrome and expand its natural history. We conducted a retrospective chart review from 1994 to 2024 of individuals with NF‐1 microdeletion syndrome followed at two large Neurofibromatosis Clinics. This cohort consists of 57 individuals with NF‐1 microdeletion syndrome (28 type‐1, 4 type‐2, 2 type‐3, 9 atypical deletions, and 14 indeterminate). We note 38/56 (67.9%) with describable facial features, 25/57 (43.8%) with plexiform neurofibromas, and 3/57 (5.2%) with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors within the observed period. The most reported neurodevelopmental manifestations from school‐age or older individuals included 39/49 (79.6%) with developmental delays, 35/49 (71.4%) with expressive and/or receptive speech delays, 33/41 (80.5%) with learning difficulties, and 23/42 (54.8%) with attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Full‐scale IQ testing data was available for 22 individuals (range: 50–96). Of the 21 adults in this cohort, 14/21 (66.7%) graduated from high school, and 4/21 (19.0%) had some college experience. Many individuals received academic support (i.e., special education, individual education plan). In this cohort, neurocognitive outcomes in adults varied more than typically reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "It's my second week on call as a new genetics attending. My feelings of imposter syndrome are at an all-time high trying to prove to myself that I know what I'm doing. I've just finished fellowship, moved to a new state, and started my first attending job within the past few months. My confidence is dwindling, and my insecurities are accosting me as I finish my notes. Maybe the whirlwind is catching up with me, I think. I come home from a long day of consults to my blonde-haired three- and one-year-old boys greeting me with big hugs and calls of \"Mommy\" and \"Ma-ma.\" The three-year-old recounts his entire day while the 1-year-old smiles, laughs, and babbles in the background. It's a normal evening with our usual routine of eating dinner, playing outside, and getting the boys ready for bed. Buzzzzzzzzz, my pager vibrates in the background disrupting this normality. I hand off bedtime duties to my husband and quickly call back the phone number. As I dial, my mind considers what the page is about: Is it a new consult, a metabolic patient in the emergency room, a mommy call? A male voice answers stating he's the resident in the pediatric intensive care unit with a new consult for me. An almost 2-year-old boy with no significant past medical history was found lethargic and gray after his nap today. The boy had a viral illness at home this morning but otherwise seemed appropriate to his parents. The septic work up so far is unrevealing besides an elevated lactate. A STAT head computed tomography (CT) has revealed bilateral thalamic and medullary hyperintensities. Leigh syndrome: the diagnosis that first pops into my brain, a life-limiting mitochondrial disorder. Typically, a child has a normal neonatal period but during the first couple years of life starts having progressive neurologic deterioration with developmental regression, hypotonia, growth concerns, and encephalopathy. The life expectancy for this disorder is the first decade of life. Children with Leigh syndrome will have peaks and valleys with symptoms improving and worsening over time but an overall steady neurologic decline. It's a life-shattering diagnosis for a family. I relay my concerns to the resident while giving my recommendations including magnetic resonance spectroscopy. I'll see him first thing in the morning—I say to myself, trying to calm my mind. Yet, my brain races through the other potential diagnoses, genetic testing options, and endless scenarios when speaking to the family. I somewhat successfully compartmentalize these thoughts while resuming my children's bedtime routine: brushing teeth, putting on pajamas, and reading bedtime stories. The next morning, as I walk into the Pediatic Intensive Care Unit (PICU), doubts trickle into my mind over my concern for a Leigh syndrome diagnosis and my ability to relay this information effectively yet compassionately to his family. At the same time, I still have confidence in my training and my expected diagnosis. I enter the room to a scene of an intubated toddler with bleach blonde hair obscured byelectroencephalogram (EEG) leads. His parents sit on the couch talking on the phone with other family members. They look overwhelmed. Dazed. Heartbroken. I introduce myself and listen to their story. They flip through their phone showing me pictures and videos of their adorable blonde-haired blue-eyed boy—smiling so proudly when he was standing by himself. Playing with them. Laughing. They share stories of how he has an infectious laugh that makes everyone's day better. They tell me he had been sick with another viral illness when he was younger which made him weak and regress on his developmental milestones. He is now back to his baseline with the help of physical therapy, pure grit, and determination. His parents smile for a split second, so proud of him, before reality slams back into their minds that their son is not healthy now. His dad sums it up: \"It's been a nightmare.\" While listening, I'm relating to them in so many ways. Just like my family, they had moved from out of state with their blonde-haired and blue-eyed son who is similar in age as my youngest. They also have a similar faith as me and had thought yesterday was going to be a normal day just like I did. In that moment, I'm taken off guard by how much their story is like mine. I try to lean into those feelings of sameness to further fuel my compassion for them as I explain my concern for Leigh syndrome and the need for rapid genetic testing. I relay that his history of past viral illness resulting in developmental regression, the head CT findings, and his decompensation during this illness made me extremely worried. The family is fully on board with undergoing genetic testing. They frantically want to know why their son is sick while also desperately wanting my hypothesis to be wrong. Results will be back next week, and they'll hold on to the glimmer of hope for good news in the interim. I'll be off service and on vacation, but one of my colleagues will be on to tell them the results. Over the next few days, my mind continues to circle back to that family. I had multiple other families with Leigh syndrome during fellowship, and unfortunately all the children passed away during my training. I had many other consults that week, some equally as concerning, yet I frequently find myself remembering this family. Why? I think back to medical school sitting in an auditorium with a lecturing physician imparting to us that some patients will resonate with you on a personal level. They'll remind you of a family member, yourself, or another loved one, and that is 100% true with this family. This could have been me, boomerangs through my mind. What if this had been my blonde-haired blue-eyed boy? My heart continues to break for this family. I scribble down these sobering emotions in my journal. For my own coping, I write a letter they'll never read and file it away in my cabinet. I occasionally unlock that drawer and read these letters to rediscover how these patients and families have influenced and shaped me into the physician and person I am today. One week later, I'm at a children's museum with my husband and two kids enjoying vacation. My blonde-haired one-year-old with eyes like summer's blueberries is in my arms when I receive a call from the genetics lab with the results. The genetic counselor's voice cuts through the laughter of the kids around me informing me that my concern was correct: Leigh syndrome. The prognosis of a life-limiting mitochondrial disorder is exactly what we all had feared. Many emotions flood my mind: How would I have discussed these results with the family? How would I have dealt with this news if I were in their shoes? Despite the implications, I'm thankful that my training has led me to the correct diagnosis as the medical team is now able to best treat this boy and give the family the support they deserve. My feelings of imposter syndrome begin to fade. I will always be learning and growing as a physician; however, I am a competent geneticist with a heart for my patients. I take a moment to collect my thoughts away from the laughter and smiles of the kids in the children's museum. I allow myself to cry and give myself some space to appropriately filter my emotions. I deal with the dichotomous feelings of being proud that I correctly diagnosed this disorder while also being sorrowful for the family and what it means for the child. I've learned that both statements are true and acceptable simultaneously; it doesn't have to be either or. I contact my on-call colleague to discuss the result, and he graciously discloses it to the family in my absence. The next day, the boy is discharged home having improved over the last week. In my short medical career, I have dealt with difficult cases that have shaken me to my core, especially this one. As a physician, how do I deal with this so I do not become jaded and lose my compassion? How do I keep from burning out? For me, I've learned to rely on my family and friends, my faith, and my journaling practice to cope with these difficult times, keep my humanity, remember my emotions, and cherish the absolute privilege it is to walk with these families during such challenging times. Truly, what an honor it is to be a part of their story as a listening ear that can offer relief with their uncertainty and treat their child with compassion. So I take their stories with me as I head home to hugs and kisses from my two blonde-haired boys. For the patient and the family to allow me to share their story and how it impacted me as a person and provider.

The consulting genetics team thinks that it is unlikely his problems are due to a genetic cause, but his extreme, confounding presentation is enough to justify trio exome sequencing. When the results reveal an unexpected, paternally inherited variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in NOTCH3 , fresh questions arise. The infant's presenting symptoms and descriptive diagnoses, including hematemesis, epistaxis, and gastric ulcers, certainly do not fit the mold of CADASIL. However, closer inspection of his family history yields tantalizing clues: a father and paternal grandfather with seizures, and a paternal grandfather with unexplained mood disturbances in middle age. Combining details gleaned from the family history and medical literature, the clinical genetics and laboratory genetics team collaborated, reclassified the VUS as likely pathogenic, and offered a new unifying diagnosis to explain much of the family's lore.",

The Germans call this technique “ augenblickdiagnose ,” and indeed, gestalt diagnosis together with systematic review is used by dysmorphologists to identify syndromes. Artists have traditionally excelled at skilled observation since it is necessary for realistic portrayal of the human form. Thus, not surprisingly, they have also often depicted syndromes and defects in artworks, decades or even centuries earlier than their medical counterparts' description. Although physicians should avoid overdiagnosing or medicalizing what may be ethnic variations, personality traits, or just artistic style, this commentary will review how syndromes and various physical differences have been represented in artworks. It will then provide practical tips on how to become better observers. The historical relationship between artists and physicians provides context for our mutual diagnostic and interpretative pursuits.",

A number of prominent artists, dating from the 16th to the 20th centuries, have depicted subjects with unusually long fingers, sometime associated with elongation of the body, neck and head.

This rare inherited condition became known by terms describing its cardinal physical signs; the eponymous name was not proposed. In 1936, Ellis et al. coined the term “gargoylism” to name the syndrome. We propose that the film The Hunchback of Notre Dame played a key role in the original association of Hurler syndrome with the architectural figures known as gargoyles and with the persistence of the term. Over time, due in large part to its extremely negative connotations and lack of accuracy, “gargoylism” was abandoned. It has been supplanted by a sophisticated clinical understanding of mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 (MPS1), the underlying enzymatic defect, and dramatic advances in early diagnosis and treatment.",

We discuss them individually, suggest the potential diagnosis, review the characteristics of their life and personal history, and briefly outline the artistic framework in which these works of art were created. This work is a posthumous tribute to the people with short stature portrayed in these works of art, who likely experienced harassment and inappropriate treatment by others and called by derogatory names.

    "abstract": "The American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C, is pleased to produce and publish this issue of Seminars in Medical Genetics, Very rare defects, What can we learn? The Guest Editors, Drs. Castilla and Mastroiacovo, and their colleagues have compiled an interesting series of articles on eight uncommonly occurring congenital malformations, all of which are certainly defects of blastogenesis [Opitz et al., 2002] and most of which have a birth prevalence of less than in 100,000 births. This issue of the Seminars is a unique contribution to AJMG Part C for two reasons: First, the impressive number of authors on all of the papers covering the very rare defects. The reason for the multi-authored articles is related to the other distinctive component of these papers, i.e., the collaborative research (see below). Because of the large number of authors, we broke from the usual tradition of the Seminars and included the traditional biographical piece only for the first author of each paper. The second reason why this is a novel issue of AJMG Seminars is the inclusion of original epidemiologic data from the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defect Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR). While there are numerous exceptions to this point about original research in Seminas articles, AJMG Part C papers ordinarily consist of review articles focusing on the issue's chosen theme. Drs. Castilla and Mastroiacovo have indeed collected a series of review articles: all of the papers follow a particular format that features a literature summary of the embryology and epidemiology of each rare defect. The novel aspect of this series is the inclusion of previously unpublished data on the epidemiology of each defect derived from ICBDSR data sets. The Editors summarize the objectives of this issue and the similar methodologies used by all the authors in their Introduction, which is a contribution to our knowledge of rare defects in and of itself. All of the works in the issue represent a collaborative effort orchestrated by the Guest Editors. Given the notable rarity of these individual malformations, the authors could not have adequately addressed the question, “What can we learn?” without combining the reviews with multicenter ICBDSR data. We applaud the Editors and their colleagues for embracing the challenge of providing potentially new insights into the cause and pathogenesis of these particularly rare anomalies.",

Significant gaps of a delayed, incomplete, siloed and decentered transition can be avoided when transition is approached in a longitudinal and holistic manner. Young adults with Down syndrome are specifically vulnerable to these gaps as the combination of intellectual differences and healthcare complexity leads to the need for a process that allows for appropriate preparation to develop the skills and process for an appropriate. To establish a successful transition care plan, the six core elements of policy, tracking, readiness, planning, transfer of care, and complete transition will compose the scaffolding of the transition process and address these gaps in care. A comprehensive tool kit including policy statements, healthcare transition tracking forms, the TRAQ tool, and template portable medical summaries will operationalize those elements and counteract any gaps in the transition process.",

We began using the PICS survey to track changes in the patient experience, including throughout changing models of care during the COVID‐19 pandemic. From February 2019 to June 2023, 62 responses from caregivers of individuals seen in the Massachusetts General Hospital Down Syndrome Program completed the PICS. Responses were scored using the standardized PICS user manual, and descriptive statistics were completed. The raw scores and composite monthly scores of the PICs were graphed in statistical process control charts. The average PICS score was 12.0 (range 2–19) out of a maximum score of 19; no shifts or trends were seen. Items with lowest scores indicated greatest opportunities for improvement related to: advice from other care team members, impact of decisions on the whole family, things causing stress or making it hard because of child's health, and offering opportunities to connect with other families. Studying the PICS in a specialty clinic for Down syndrome for the first time has established a baseline for future quality improvement work and interventions to increase care integration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Our current understanding of adaptation in families of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) is based primarily on findings from studies focused on participants from a single country. Guided by the Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation, the purpose of this cross‐country investigation, which is part of a larger, mixed methods study, was twofold: (1) to compare family adaptation in 12 countries, and (2) to examine the relationships between family variables and family adaptation. The focus of this study is data collected in the 12 countries where at least 30 parents completed the survey. Descriptive statistics were generated, and mean family adaptation was modeled in terms of each predictor independently, controlling for an effect on covariates. A parsimonious composite model for mean family adaptation was adaptively generated. While there were cross‐country differences, standardized family adaptation mean scores fell within the average range for all 12 countries. Key components of the guiding framework (i.e., family demands, family appraisal, family resources, and family problem‐solving communication) were important predictors of family adaptation. More cross‐country studies, as well as longitudinal studies, are needed to fully understand how culture and social determinants of health influence family adaptation in families of individuals with DS.",

    "abstract": "The internet (and now social media) has been a source of information about medical conditions and their treatments for some time (Bouwman et al., 2010; Dragusin et al., 2013; Finney Rutten et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2021; Wallace et al., 2022). Clinical geneticists may be confronted by patients or parents who have done internet “research” about potential diagnoses and treatments for their medical issues. While these suggested diagnoses might not be relevant at times, in some cases, these internet searches may reveal the correct diagnosis for rare diseases that would not have otherwise been considered by the provider (Bouwman et al., 2010; Greenwald, 2005). Through virtual one-hour interviews with patients or their caregivers (University of Kentucky IRB approved protocol #86093), we present the journey of seven families who came to their providers with the correct diagnosis ahead of their clinical genetics appointment (Table 1). For narrative clarity, we present their experiences in three sequential chronological stages that reflect their experiences. SGSH: c.734G>A (p.Arg245His)/c.892T>C (p.Ser298Pro) Parents of patients with undiagnosed genetic disorders may feel a strong motivation to discover their child's diagnosis. They often have seen and known their child in ways that were not possible for their medical providers. These parents may have access to diagnostically relevant information that is not available to their treatment team. The mother of Patient 6 said concerning her daughter “I'm seeing her movements and the way she behaves and her acts and just everything about her all day, every day, in every shape and every form of it, which is why I could see it, some of those little nuances that [her providers] could not see in that 30-minute session…. I can see why doctors can overlook certain things because you're not spending your life with these people to see the ins and outs of everything.” Parents of patients with undiagnosed genetic disorders and the patients themselves may feel unsure of where to turn or what to do. The dilemma of the patient and family can be compounded by the medical provider's lack of understanding of the situation. As the mother of Patient 3 said, “The most challenging part is physicians not being aware and being just as lost as you.” Prior to receiving the diagnosis of their child's genetic condition, many parents sensed something was wrong with their child but they had no explanation. Some felt guilty they might have done something wrong and worried they were to blame for their child's condition. The mother of Patient 6 said, “It was always this game for myself of, ‘What am I not doing right?’ Or, ‘What am I doing wrong?’ Maybe it's my fault.” The mother of Patient 4 wondered, “What did I do? What did I eat? Was it that ‘McFlurry’ that I had that one time when I was six months pregnant?” I did have somebody who was like, “Well, did you eat all organic when you were pregnant?” And it was just “Are you kidding me?” Little comments like that …. “Did anything happen while you were pregnant? Did you eat something weird? Did you get sick? Did you get a virus?” Those kinds of questions on their face sound well-meaning, but really they don't feel well-meaning when they're received.” I just burst into tears. I was crying so hard because he didn't have leukemia. And I was actually thinking that if he had leukemia, then I would have a path…. But not hitting another wall of nobody knows what's wrong with your child was, to me, worse than finding out your child didn't have cancer…. It tells you the mindset that you get into, the state of mind that you're in when you're just eight years of trying and trying. The mother of Patient 1 noted the awkwardness of being unable to tell others what was wrong with her child. She said, “And when you say you don't know, it's really hard because people don't believe you, for one, that he is really special needs, they question it.” ‘How do you not know?’ I can't even tell you how many times I've been asked, ‘How do you not know what he has?’ She also expressed a sense of isolation because “There is no organization for you for kids that don't have a diagnosis.” Two families were wrongly accused of abuse or neglect by their medical providers before the diagnosis was known. Patient 2 had chronic failure to thrive and severe nasal regurgitation (Figure 1a). Patient 2's pediatric gastroenterologist called the pediatrician and “said that it was a social issue” and that Patient 2's parents “were the problem.” Patient 2's feeding difficulties and failure to thrive resulted from his genetic disorder and were not his parents' fault. At 3 weeks of age, Patient 3 was discovered to have fractured ribs and arm contractures (Figure 1b,c). Her mother said “When they came back to us and told us about the fractures, they immediately followed up with, they contacted Child Protective Services. Without warning, without conversation, without explanation, it was ‘We found this. As a result, this is now taking place.’” The parents' interaction with Patient 3 in the hospital was monitored constantly. This unexpected situation was traumatic and fearful for the parents. Her mother said, “I've never cried so much in my life [as] during that hospital stay.” Patient 3's fractures and contractures were the result of her genetic disorder, not parental abuse. Many of the parents of patients in this study took the initiative to search their children's symptoms online and found answers for themselves. The mother of Patient 6 had concerns during infancy and went to her pediatrician by 1 year of age because her daughter was “never laughing” (Figure 1d,e). “I never got those baby giggles and I didn't understand why,” she said. Subtle concerns with her development persisted during childhood to the point that by third grade the mother “could tell she's regressing.” Through social media, she recognized that some of her daughter's traits were also present in a girl who appeared on her TikTok feed. “We had a pediatrician's appointment and I told her, I just said, ‘Listen, it sounds crazy. I saw a TikTok. This is what it is.’” After a referral to Genetics, her suspicion was confirmed. The mother of Patient 4 noticed her son's “face looks like us and his eyes are completely different” (Figure 1f). She also noticed he has long hair on his elbows, searched “hairy elbows” online, and “something called hairy elbow syndrome came up.” She found an older website with photos of the faces of children with the syndrome. She exclaimed: “And I almost fell out of my chair. And at that point, I had said a thousand times, oh, I know this is it! I know this is it!” Subsequent genetic testing proved she was correct. The mother of Patient 1 was approached by a person who visited her home and persistently urged her to look into the possibility that her son had a rare genetic condition. At first, the mother was skeptical, but later she looked this syndrome up online. She “scrolled through looking at all the kids, and I came across a boy that looked exactly like him (Figure 1g,h). And that's when I thought, “This actually might be it. This could be it.” She told her primary care physician she thought her son had this condition. Subsequent genetic testing proved she was correct. The mother of Patient 5 “went down the rabbit hole” and frequently searched online for information concerning symptoms such as “bulgy eyes, lump on head.” She “kept looking and looking” until she found a photograph of a little girl in Sweden who looked “exactly” like her daughter (Figure 1i). The mother said after receiving the diagnosis “the first thing I did was I looked over at my husband and I told him … ‘I knew it. I knew it.’” The geneticist confirmed the suspected diagnosis. Many participants in this study were glad they researched the symptoms and discovered the diagnosis for their cases. Some participants came away from their experience of facing symptoms, research, diagnosis, and treatment with new perspectives on their lives, values, and priorities. The mother of Patient 6 said the diagnosis of her daughter's genetic disorder “definitely took some of the burden off of my self-doubt of what maybe I was doing wrong or what I wasn't doing right, so that was helpful.” The mother of Patient 4 likewise noted, “The diagnosis was what helped the most.” She recalled that when her son was finally diagnosed she “was so excited” and her provider “laughed with me and she said, ‘I think you're the only person I've spoken with who was this excited that your son has a genetic disorder that causes all these problems.’ But I was ecstatic. I was so ecstatic that now I had a path. I had the name to call it. I had a goal. I have learned to just accept him for who he is and love him for who he is.” The mother of Patient 1 said, “I don't think people understand how much just being able to tell people what my kid has is instead of people questioning me, there's a lot of freedom in that.” Patient 7, an adult survivor with Fabry disease (Figure 1j), felt his own research in his case made “a huge difference” and he probably would not be alive today without it. His struggle with Fabry disease helps him to “appreciate life every day.” He realizes “none of us are guaranteed another year or two years or even tomorrow, so make the most you can with the current day and give thanks for that.” The mother of Patient 2 said her relationship with her husband has changed for the better. Their son's health crisis caused them to “lean more towards each other” and say to each other that “you and I need to take care of ourselves and our relationship.” What we providers see as a “diagnostic odyssey” is for patient's families an emotional odyssey (Figure 2). In some cases, these caregivers were encouraged and helped by their providers who served as advocates for them. In other cases, they were dismissed, not listened to, merely tolerated, or even suspected of wrongdoing by some providers. Some caregivers felt judged by others. A health crisis that started with negative feelings of guilt, shame, blame, and isolation became the driving factor to take matters into their own hands to find the answer they were seeking. In addition to the expected relief of finding what eluded them for so long, these families were able to find comfort in the connections they were able to establish. They became their child's best advocate. Some expressed hope that in the future more providers will be familiar with genetic disorders and their symptoms. These seven cases demonstrate how patients with genetic disorders and their caregivers became active and significant participants in their care. They were strongly motivated to find answers in these cases, they had access to needed information, and they were on the right track. Genetics providers should be open to discussing the relevance of information and insights offered by patients and their caregivers, and collaborate with them to provide the best care. Robert B.

The field of genetics and genomics has changed dramatically since our 2010 special issue on holoprosencephaly and we are sure the readers will gain an understanding of holoprosencephaly In the introduction, we would like to recognize Dr. Erich Roessler's achievements and his long-standing commitment to holoprosencephaly (HPE) research. Originally hailing from Texas, Erich has spent his professional life on the East Coast between the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). One Erich's first major successes in this area came early in his career at CHOP when he identified mutations in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) as a cause of HPE, making SHH the first gene to be associated with HPE. Subsequently, Erich would be a force in adding more genes and biological explanations to the list of etiologies for HPE including SIX3, TGIF1, FGFR1, FGF8, and GAS1. This body of work has led to our understanding of complex gene networks as well as continued elucidation of how variants in different genes may lead to clinically similar phenotypes. The advancement of this paradigm energized the field of molecular diagnostics and expanded our understanding of genetic mechanisms in children and adults with HPE. In addition to his scientific contributions, Erich has worked with many scientists and mentored generations of fledging researchers over the last two decades. As laboratory science often involves many hours of steady work with occasional interruptions of joy and excitement, Erich has kept his colleagues moving forward with his dry sense of humor, keen insights, and exceptional teaching abilities. Many of his Erich's mentees have graduated to positions away from CHOP and the NIH; however, we all know firsthand that they carry fond memories of Erich as a caring mentor, loyal friend, and scientific advocate (see some selected quotes from trainees and colleagues below). From a trainee point of view, Erich has always displayed a deep commitment to asking and exploring research questions in a rigorous and careful way as well as a very healthy skepticism about any new and shiny object, such as a novel cause of a disease or a new way to identify these causes. Many of the junior people in the laboratory (including two of the authors of this dedication!) tend to be easily entranced by these new and shiny objects. We had a joke that Erich would always listen to these ideas, would give a noncommittal reply, and then, within a day or two, would come back with what was typically a great—and sometimes heartbreaking—counterargument or probing question. At first, we newbies would be disgruntled, and assume that Erich just could not see how brilliant and different some new approach was, and that we could appreciate it because we were so open-minded (read: inexperienced and arrogant). However, time and time again, additional data or experiments would sooner or later prove that Erich had been right from the get-go. After a few rounds of this, we tended to immediately run to Erich with any new-fangled hypothesis, and we definitely listened much more attentively when he detailed why we needed to think about things more deeply. More importantly, all of us realized how important it was to carefully apply the scientific method to our research practices, and that actually understanding the biology behind a question was much better than simply amassing tons of data and pulling out a semi-random correlation. The best thing about Erich is that, while he sometimes got a little “I told you so” smile on his face, he was always also very happy to admit when something was the real deal—this excited him more than any of us—because he really understood what a big deal it was to not only have an idea but also to provide strong evidence for it. P. Kruszka is a clinical geneticist in the National Human Genome Research Institute and a Captain in the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service. He leads several studies on genetic conditions and has specific interests in cardiac, neurologic, and other disorders. B. D. Solomon is the managing director of GeneDx. He is also a practicing, board-certified clinical geneticist. M. Muenke is the chief of the Medical Genetics Branch in the National Human Genome Research Institute. He has a longstanding interest in elucidating the genetics behind holoprosencephaly, craniofacial malformation syndromes, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as an interest in improving knowledge about the formation of the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Technology has changed the way we approach medical care: health data is constantly being generated, medical discoveries are progressing more rapidly, and individuals are more connected across the world than ever before. Backpack Health is a global personal health record platform that harnesses the power of technology to connect users to their primary health data sources, the medical community, and researchers. By syncing with existing patient portals, health data can be stored on the Backpack Health platform and easily accessed and controlled by users in one connected interface. Individuals manage and collate their current and past conditions, genetic test results, symptoms, medications, procedures, labs, and other health data. Users are empowered to disseminate their information to clinicians, researchers, foundations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies they connect with through the Backpack Health application. Here, we describe how two rare disease advocacy groups, The Marfan Foundation and Project Alive, utilize Backpack Health to connect with their target populations. Through secure transfer of pseudonymized data, groups can query their members to improve understanding of clinical features and to facilitate meaningful research. Responses to the groups' surveys show strong member engagement with high completion rates and increases in new Backpack Health users when surveys are deployed. Data from these surveys have been published and used to better inform clinical outcomes for treatment trials. By connecting users directly to the foundations, clinicians, researchers, and industry partners working on their condition, Backpack Health is instrumental in fast‐tracking medical discoveries and treatment for rare diseases.",

Herein, we hypothesized a higher proportion of respiratory and co-occurring respiratory and GI medication prescription claims among persons with EDS compared to their matched controls with increases among peripubertal women with EDS. We compared the proportions of respiratory and co-occurring respiratory and GI medication prescription claims among persons with EDS (aged 5-62) against their age-, sex-, state of residence-, and earliest claim date-matched controls using 10 years of private prescription claims data. Prescription claims among persons with EDS versus matched controls were increased for eight medication classes (p < .0001): intranasal/inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (30.8% vs. 19.0%), oral steroids (30.0% vs. 16.5%), H1-antihistamines (26.2% vs. 12.2%), short-acting beta agonists (22.7% vs. 11.6%), decongestants (21.6% vs. 15.9%), leukotriene modifiers (8.9% vs. 3.6%), ICS/long-acting beta agonists (5.7% vs. 2.9%), muscarinic antagonists (2.5% vs. 0.9%), and co-occurring prescriptions (29% vs. 10%). Our results suggest a critical time window for peripubertal intervention and research and a need to focus on the pathogenesis and clinical evaluation of EDS-specific respiratory and aerodigestive disorders.",
