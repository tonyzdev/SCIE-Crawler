    "abstract": "Bullying was investigated as a group process, a social phenomenon taking place in a school setting among 573 Finnish sixth-grade children (286 girls, 287 boys) aged 12–13 years. Different Participant Roles taken by individual children in the bullying process were examined and related to a) self-estimated behavior in bullying situations, b) social acceptance and social rejection, and c) belongingness to one of the five sociometric status groups (popular, rejected, neglected, controversial, and average). The Participant Roles assigned to the subject were Victim, Bully, Reinforcer of the bully, Assistant of the bully, Defender of the victim, and Outsider. There were significant sex differences in the distribution of Participant Roles. Boys were more frequently in the roles of Bully, Reinforcer and Assistant, while the most frequent roles of the girls were those of Defender and Outsider. The subjects were moderately well aware of their Participant Roles, although they underestimated their participation in active bullying behavior and emphasized that they acted as Defenders and Outsiders. The sociometric status of the children was found to be connected to their Participant Roles. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The key aim of the present research was to study the “functionality” of two global variables in the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire and to examine the appropriateness of different cutoff points of these variables for prevalence estimation. Several empirical and conceptual analyses strongly attested to the functionality of the two selected variables in terms of construct validity and selected measurement properties. Similarly, a number of analyses indicated that (having been bullied/having bullied other students) “2 or 3 times a month” was a reasonable and useful lower‐bound cutoff point. With this cutoff point, “involved” students, victims, and bullies differed very markedly and in clearly different ways from “non‐involved” students in conceptually related variables. Prevalence estimates derived in this way can be conveniently obtained, have a reasonably well‐defined meaning, can be easily understood by users, and can be reproduced unambiguously by different researchers/administrators and at different times. An important background for the article is the fact that several common methods, including peer nominations, are not well suited for prevalence estimation. Prevalence data for victims, bullies, and bully‐victims are also presented. All data were derived from the New Bergen Project Against Bullying, comprising a sample of 5,171 students from 37 schools in the town community of Bergen, Norway. At the time of the data collection, the spring of 1997, the 2,544 girls and 2,627 boys were in grades 5 through 9, with modal ages of 11 through 15 years. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Gender differences in regard to aggressive behaviour were investigated in a series of studies of schoolchildren of different age cohorts: 8-year-olds (N = 85), 11-year-olds (N = 167), and 15-year-olds (N = 127). Different types of aggressive behaviour were measured with peer nomination techniques, supported by self-ratings. The social structure of the peer groups were also studied. The results of the 11-year-old cohort were previously presented by Lagerspetz et al. [1988; Aggressive Behavior 14:403–414], but they are compared here with the other age groups. The principal finding was that girls of the two older cohorts overall make greater use of indirect means of aggression, whereas boys tend to employ direct means. Previously, the main difference between the genders has been thought to be that boys use physical aggressive strategies, while girls prefer verbal ones. Our studies suggest that the differentiation between direct and indirect strategies of aggression presents a more exact picture. Indirect aggressive strategies were not yet fully developed among the 8-year-old girls, but they were already prominent among the 11-year-old girls. Aggressive behaviour was assessed overall by the children themselves to be the highest in this age group.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study reports the development of the Reactive–Proactive Aggression Questionnaire (RPQ), and the differential correlates of these two forms of aggression. Antisocial, psychosocial and personality measures were obtained at ages 7 and 16 years in schoolboys, while the RPQ was administered to 334 of the boys at age 16 years. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a significant fit for a two‐factor proactive–reactive model that replicated from one independent subsample to another. Proactive aggression was uniquely characterized at age 7 by initiation of fights, strong‐arm tactics, delinquency, poor school motivation, poor peer relationships, single‐parent status, psychosocial adversity, substance‐abusing parents, and hyperactivity, and at age 16 by a psychopathic personality, blunted affect, delinquency, and serious violent offending. Reactive aggression was uniquely characterized at age 16 by impulsivity, hostility, social anxiety, lack of close friends, unusual perceptual experiences, and ideas of reference. Findings confirm and extend the differential correlates of proactive–reactive aggression, and demonstrate that this brief but reliable and valid self‐report instrument can be used to assess proactive and reactive aggression in child and adolescent samples.

The social structure of the peer groups also was studied. The principal finding was that girls made greater use of indirect means of aggression, whereas the boys tended to employ direct means. Gender differences in verbal aggression were less pronounced. The social structure of peer groups was found to be tighter among girls, making it easier for them to exploit relationships and harm their victims by indirect manipulative aggression. Because indirect aggression has rarely been satisfactorily studied with tests of aggression, this finding may help to explain 1) the generally lower correlation found between peer-rated and self-rated aggression in girls than among boys (indirect means not being so readily recognized by the subject as a kind of aggression) and 2) the low stability of aggressiveness in girls often found in developmental studies.",

Nineteen cases of severe victimization by harassment were interviewed. Subjectively experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety were estimated with two subscales form SCL-90 [Derogatis LR, Lipman RS, Covi L (1973): Psychopharmacology Bulletin 9: 13-28] and aggressiveness was measured with the Buss-Durkee Inventory [Buss A, Durkee A (1957): Journal of Consulting Psychology 21: 343–349]. Females experienced themselves as significantly more harassed than men. Position was related to harassment: individuals in superior positions harassed more often than individuals in subordinate positions. Less victimization by harassment was experienced among individuals involved in research and teaching than among individuals involved in administration and service. The experienced reasons for harassment were predominantly envy and competition about jobs and status. In 25% of cases, victims felt that their sex might be a reason. Victims of harassment experienced higher levels of depression, anxiety, and aggression than others. The interviewed cases showed evidence of symptoms reminiscent of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "A theory is presented to account for the development of habitual aggressive behavior during early childhood. It is argued that the aggressive child is one who has acquired aggressive scripts to guide behavior early in life. Once established these scripts become resistant to change and may even persist into adulthood. Aggressive scripts are acquired and maintained through both observational and enactive learning processes. These processes interact with each other as actual aggressive behavior engenders conditions under which the observation of aggressive behavior is more likely and creates conditions that provoke rather than inhibit aggression. The cumulative result is a network of cognitive scripts for social behavior emphasizing aggressive responding. A number of intervening variables may play a role in this cycle, and among the more important would seem to be popularity and academic achievement. Once encoded, the scripts for aggressive behavior may be elicited through a general activation of memory or by specific cues to which the person is exposed. Some of the most potent cues should be those present when the script was encoded, though any aggressive cue may trigger the retrieval of an aggressive script. Thus, observed violence not only provides scripts for future behavior but also triggers the recall of existing aggressive scripts. If these scripts are rehearsed, their recall in the future will be more likely. If undampened, this cumulative learning process can build enduring schemas for aggressive behavior that persist into adulthood.",

It is suggested here that such actions, while both tragic and frightening, are only a small part of a much larger problem of workplace aggression—efforts by individuals to harm others with whom they work or the organizations in which they are employed. The present study investigated two major hypotheses with respect to such aggression: 1) contrary to what media reports suggest, most aggression occurring in work settings is verbal, indirect, and passive rather than physical, direct, and active; 2) recent changes in many organizations (e.g., downsizing, increased workforce diversity) have generated conditions that may contribute to the occurrence of workplace aggression. A survey of 178 employed persons provided partial support for both predictions. Verbal and passive forms of aggression were rated as more frequent by participants than physical and active forms of aggression. In addition, the greater the extent to which several changes had occurred recently in participants' organizations, the greater the incidence of workplace aggression they reported. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Three hundred and eighteen Italian adolescents (142 girls and 176 boys; mean age = 13.2 years) completed the Davis's Interpersonal Reactivity Index [Davis, 1983] for empathy and the Participant role scales [Salmivalli et al., 1996] for bullying and defending behavior. The results revealed that the model fitted the data adequately, but only in the case of boys. As hypothesized, low levels of empathic responsiveness were associated to students' involvement in bullying others. In contrast, empathy was positively associated with actively helping victimized schoolmates. However, the estimates algorithm did not reach convergence with girls' data.

We examined the contribution of moral disengagement (MD), hostile attribution bias, and outcome expectancies, and we further explored the individual contribution of each MD mechanism. Our aim was to identify shared and unique cognitive factors of the two forms of aggression. Three hundred and thirty-nine secondary school children completed self-report measures that assessed MD, hostile attribution bias, outcome expectancies, and their roles and involvement in traditional and cyber aggression. We found that the MD total score positively related to both forms of peer-directed aggression. Furthermore, traditional peer aggression positively related to children's moral justification, euphemistic language, displacement of responsibility and outcome expectancies, and negatively associated with hostile attribution bias. Moral justification also related positively to cyber aggression. Cyber aggression and cyber victimization were associated with high levels of traditional peer aggression and victimization, respectively. The results suggest that MD is a common feature of both traditional and cyber peer aggression, but it seems that traditional forms of aggression demand a higher level of rationalization or justification. Moreover, the data suggest that the expectation of positive outcomes from harmful behavior facilitates engagement in traditional peer aggression. The differential contribution of specific cognitive mechanisms indicates the need for future research to elaborate on the current findings, in order to advance theory and inform existing and future school interventions tackling aggression and bullying.",

    "abstract": "Abstract From the rapidly growing literature on bullying, it is increasingly recognised that peer relationship problems as manifested in being bullied are associated with low self‐esteem. However, the literature on self‐esteem in relation to children who bully others is controversial. The objective of this paper is to elucidate further our understanding of the relationship between self‐concept and bullying behaviour. Data from a nationwide study of bullying behaviour carried out in Ireland during 1993‐1994 have been reviewed. The relevant results from 8,249 school children aged 8 to 18 years are presented. The paper examines the global and dimensional nature of self‐esteem and how it relates to children and adolescents who either have been victimised or bullied others. A distinction is made between “pure victims,” “pure bullies,” and children and adolescents who were both bullied and who bullied others. In other words, pure victims were those who had not bullied others, and pure bullies had not themselves been bullied. Those who were both bullied and bullied others were subdivided further into victims who bully occasionally, sometimes, and frequently and bullies who are victimised, occasionally, sometimes, and frequently. The results show that children of both primary and post‐primary age who were involved in bullying as victims, bullies, or both had significantly lower global self‐esteem than did children who had neither bullied nor been bullied. However, the pure bullies, in contrast to the pure victims, placed the same value on their physical attractiveness and attributes and on their popularity as did their peers who had not bullied others or been bullied. The bully‐victims of all ages had the lowest self‐esteem of the subgroups in the study. Also, the more frequently children were victimised or bullied others, the lower was their global self‐esteem. The typology and frequency of bullying and the age of the children when they were involved in bullying influenced the status of the specific domains of self‐esteem. There were, e.g., significant differences in anxiety between the pure bullies of post‐primary age and their peers who had not bullied others or been bullied. The post‐primary children who bullied most frequently were the least anxious. The results indicate that high self‐esteem protects children and adolescents from involvement in bullying. Thus, in view of the strong relationship between self‐esteem and bullying that has been found in the present paper, it is recommended that top priority be given by parents and teachers to preventing and reducing feelings of poor self‐worth among children and adolescents.

The aim of the present study was to delineate, using Principal Components Analysis, types of peer-victimization and to develop a multidimensional psychometric self-report scale. Respondents were 812 children aged 11 to 16 years and attending a secondary school in England. Once it was established that respondents were familiar with a definition of bullying, they rated how often they had experienced 45 different victimizing acts. Four main factors were identified—physical victimization, verbal victimization, social manipulation, and attacks on property—and subscales constructed that possessed satisfactory internal consistency and convergent validity with self-reports of being bullied.

Their reactive and proactive aggression was measured by means of peer and teacher reports. Peer and teacher reports were more concordant with respect to reactive than proactive aggression. Comparing the children in different bullying roles in terms of their reactive and proactive aggression, bully‐victims were found to be the most aggressive group of all. For this group, it was typical to be highly aggressive both reactively and proactively. Although bullies were significantly less aggressive than bully‐victims, they scored higher than victims and controls on both reactive and proactive aggression. However, observations at the person level, i.e., cross‐tabulational analyses, indicated that bullies were not only overrepresented among children who were both reactively and procatively aggressive but also among the only reactively aggressive as well as the only proactively aggressive groups. Victims scored higher than control children on reactive aggression, but they were not proactively aggressive. Furthermore, even their reactive aggression was at a significantly lower level than that of bullies and bully‐victims. Aggr. Behav. 28:30–44, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

However, the linkages between peer victimization and externalizing problems over time have not been systematically examined, and it is therefore unknown if externalizing problems are antecedents of victimization, consequences of victimization, both, or neither. This study provides a meta-analysis of 14 longitudinal studies examining prospective linkages between peer victimization and externalizing problems (n = 7,821). Two prospective paths were examined: the extent to which peer victimization at baseline predicts future residualized changes in externalizing problems, as well as the extent to which externalizing problems at baseline predict future residualized changes in peer victimization. Results revealed significant associations between peer victimization and subsequent residualized changes in externalizing problems, as well as significant associations between externalizing problems and subsequent residualized changes in peer victimization. Hence, externalizing problems function as both antecedents and consequences of peer victimization.",

Moreover, children's understanding of moral emotions and proneness to moral disengagement was assessed. Victims showed some difficulties in the social cognition task, whereas bullies did not. Aggressive children, instead, were found to be more ready to show moral disengagement mechanisms, whereas defenders showed higher levels of moral sensibility. Results are discussed in relation to the two models, and the need for further research into empathy and moral cognition of children involved in bullying episodes is highlighted. Aggr.

    "abstract": "A revised version of the Bully/Victim Questionnaire [Olweus, 1991] was given to 2,086 fifth–tenth grader students from schools in two German federal states. The results were analysed in terms of frequencies of self-reports of different forms of bullying (physical, verbal, relational/indirect; for bullies and for victims), gender and grade differences. Overall, 12.1% of the students reported bullying others and 11.1% reported being bullied (victimisation). We classified 2.3% of the students as bully/victims due to their self-report. Significantly more boys reported bullying others, regardless of bullying form, and significantly more boys than girls were classified as bully/victims. Although there was no gender difference for victimisation at all, boys reported significantly more often than girls being bullied physically. Besides, self-reports of pure and overlapping forms of bullying behaviour (relational, verbal, physical) were analysed. With regard to age trends, students from middle grades reported the highest rates of bullying. Self-reported rates of victimisation were higher for younger students, regardless of form of victimisation. Furthermore, class size was not linked to reports of bullying and victimisation. Results from logistic regression analyses emphasised that the variables \"gender\" and \"grade\" add significantly to the prediction of self-reported bullying; \"grade\" and variables measuring impaired psychosocial \"well-being\" of students at school (e.g., feeling of not being popular, negative attitude towards breaks) add significantly to the prediction of self-reported victimisation. The results are discussed against the background of other study findings, accentuating the significance of gender- and age-specific forms of bullying/victimisation. Aggr.

However, recent research in several countries has challenged this notion by considering different forms of aggression. This paper provides an overview of a qualitative investigation of teenage girls' indirect forms of aggression (e.g., exclusion from the group, spreading false stories). Focus groups and pair and individual interviews were used to collect data from adolescent girls and their teachers in two schools. The study provides some clear insights into the nature of teenage girls' indirect aggression. The predominant indirectly aggressive behaviors include talking about others and excluding peers from the group. Key explanations for these behaviors concern a desire to create excitement and a range of friendship and group processes centered on girls' needs for close personal relationships and to be a part of the peer group. The girls described the devastating effects of indirect aggression, particularly on girls with certain characteristics that predispose them to victimization. The girls were pessimistic about the potential of interventions, although peer mediation processes may be a way forward. Aggr. Behav. 26:67–83, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Using cross‐sectional data, we assessed grade and sex differences in self‐reports of bullying and sexually harassing peers, as well as reports of dating aggression from1896 students from early to late adolescence. Reports of bullying others were highest around the school transition, with lowest levels at the end of high school. Boys reported more bullying and sexual harassment than girls. Sexual harassment of same‐ and opposite‐sex peers increased over the early adolescent years and leveled off in later high‐school years. There were no sex differences in the prevalence of indirect or physical aggression with a dating partner. Adolescents who bullied were at increased risk for the other forms of relationship aggression. These data highlight bullying as a relationship problem and point to the need for prevention programs to curtail the use of power and aggression in adolescent relationships. Aggr.

As a validation bullies were contrasted with victims. Bullies had direct status goals (measured with the Interpersonal Goal Inventory for Children) and showed dominance as measured with proactive aggression. Moreover, as predicted from a goal perspective, bullying behavior was related to prestige in terms of perceived popularity. In contrast, victims lacked status goals, were only reactively aggressive, and low on prestige. That being popular is not the same as being liked could be shown by the fact that bullies were just as rejected as victims by their classmates. Eighth-grade bullies had more direct status goals than fourth-grade bullies, possibly indicating that striving for the popularity component of status increases in early adolescence.",

Disrupted parent discipline and irritable microsocial exchanges within the family were hypothesized to provide a basic training for aggression that generalizes to other settings such that the child is identified by peers, teachers, and parents as physically aggressive. Physical fighting was thought to lead to rejection by the normal peer group, which was hypothesized to feed back to further exacerbate fighting. Multilevel assessment including interview, questionnaires, laboratory studies, and home observations were carried out with the families of 91 preadolescent and adolescent boys. Nine indicators from the assessment battery were used to define the constructs Inept Parental Discipline, Negative Microsocial Exchanges, Physical Fighting, and Poor Peer Relations. Structural equations (LISREL VI) were used to describe the relations among the constructs. The t values for the path coefficients were significant. A chi-square analysis showed an acceptable fit between the model and the empirical findings.

    "abstract": "Abstract Research on peer rejection has long emphasized links between aggressive behavior and peer liking, with aggressive children and adolescents being more rejected by peers. However, recent research shows that at least some aggressive students enjoy considerable power and influence and are perceived as “popular” within the peer group. To understand the processes underlying links between aggression and social status, the present research considered three distinct indices of social status (social preference, perceived popularity, and power) and investigated the degree to which the possession of peer‐valued characteristics moderated the links between status and aggression and whether these links varied by sex. A sample of 585 adolescents (grades 6–10) completed peer evaluation measures assessing social status, aggression (overt/physical, indirect/relational), and the degree to which peers possessed eight different peer‐valued characteristics (e.g., attractiveness, athleticism, etc.). Although sociometric indices of status were significantly related to perceived popularity, especially for boys, perceptions of power were more strongly linked to perceived popularity than to sociometric likeability. Moreover, the three indices of social status were differentially related to peers' assessments of aggression and to peer‐valued characteristics, with notable sex differences. As predicted, regression analyses demonstrated that the observed relationships between social status and aggression were moderated by the possession of peer‐valued characteristics; aggressive students who possessed peer‐valued characteristics enjoyed higher levels of perceived popularity and power and less disliking than those who did not. This relationship varied as a function of sex, the type of aggression considered, and the status construct predicted. Aggr. Behav. 32:396–408, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The results show that both traditional bullying and cyberbullying have a significant prevalence in the samples. Emotional responses are linked to types of bullying. Analysis of answers identified specific emotional profiles for the different types of bullying and cyberbullying. Direct bullying and cyberbullying via mobile phone showed similar profiles, and also indirect bullying and cyberbullying using the Internet. Similarities and differences between profiles are discussed and some hypotheses are presented to explain the results. In addition, school grade, gender, country, and severity of bullying episodes were related to the specific emotional profiles of each type of bullying. Aggr.

We challenge the traditionally held belief that bullying results from maladaptive development by reviewing evidence that bullying may be, in part, an evolved, facultative, adaptive strategy that offers some benefits to its practitioners. In support of this view, we draw from research that suggests bullying serves to promote adolescent bullies' evolutionarily-relevant somatic, sexual, and dominance goals, has a genetic basis, and is widespread among nonhuman animals. We identify and explain differences in the bullying behavior of the two sexes, as well as when and why bullying is adaptive and when it may not be. We offer commentary on both the failures and successes of current anti-bullying interventions from an evolutionary perspective and suggest future directions for both research and anti-bullying interventions.",

During play-fighting, snout or oral contact is directed at the opponent's nape of the neck, whereas during serious fighting, male residents mostly direct their bites at the intruder's rump. Although similar to those used in serious fighting, the behavior patterns used during play-fighting are modified to achieve the different targets of attack. Even though the tactics of attack and defense appear more adult-like with increasing age, the playful targets persist well into adulthood.",

A total of 7,290 (3,756 girls) students (ages 13–18 yr) from a region of Southern Ontario, Canada, completed a number of self‐report measures to determine the relation between direct and indirect bullying and victimization and several psychosocial risk factors, including normative beliefs about antisocial acts, angry‐externalizing coping, social anxiety, depression, self‐esteem, temperament, attachment, parental monitoring and peer relational problems. ANCOVA and logistic regression analyses indicated that indirect bully‐victims and victims were similar in demonstrating greater internalizing problems and peer relational problems than indirect bullies and uninvolved participants. Furthermore, adolescents involved in indirect bullying (bullies, bully‐victims) reported a higher level of normative beliefs legitimizing antisocial behaviour and less parental monitoring (males only) than indirect victims and uninvolved participants. Only normative beliefs legitimizing antisocial behaviour distinguished direct bully‐victims and bullies from victims and uninvolved adolescents. Results illuminate the distinct characteristics of direct and indirect bully‐victims; theoretical and clinical implications are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 32:551–569. 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

This is proposed to be because of a change in rape‐related beliefs toward more subtle content. Incorporating insights from racism and sexism research, a 30‐item self‐report scale measuring the acceptance of modern myths about sexual aggression (AMMSA) is presented. Across four studies (total N =1,279), the reliability and validity of parallel German and English versions of the AMMSA scale were examined. The results show that both language versions are highly reliable; compared with a traditional RMA scale, means of AMMSA scores are higher and their distributions more closely approximate normality.

Using structural equation modeling, we examined the relations between mindfulness, rumination, and aggression. In a pair of studies, we found a pattern of correlations consistent with rumination partially mediating a causal link between mindfulness and hostility, anger, and verbal aggression. The pattern was not consistent with rumination mediating the association between mindfulness and physical aggression. Although it is impossible with the current nonexperimental data to test causal mediation, these correlations support the idea that mindfulness could reduce rumination, which in turn could reduce aggression. These results suggest that longitudinal work and experimental manipulations mindfulness would be worthwhile approaches for further study of rumination and aggression.

This study examined the factor structure of, associations between, and gender differences in relational and physical aggression in C hina, C olombia, I taly, J ordan, K enya, the P hilippines, S weden, T hailand, and the U nited S tates. Children ages 7–10 years ( N = 1,410) reported on their relationally and physically aggressive behavior. Relational and physical aggression shared a common factor structure across countries. In all nine countries, relational and physical aggression were significantly correlated (average r = .49). Countries differed in the mean levels of both relational and physical aggression that children reported using and with respect to whether children reported using more physical than relational aggression or more relational than physical aggression. Boys reported being more physically aggressive than girls across all nine countries; no consistent gender differences emerged in relational aggression. Despite mean‐level differences in relational and physical aggression across countries, the findings provided support for cross‐country similarities in associations between relational and physical aggression as well as links between gender and aggression.

Following the General Aggression Model, we suggest that frequent and repetitive exposure to hate speech leads to desensitization to this form of verbal violence and subsequently to lower evaluations of the victims and greater distancing, thus increasing outgroup prejudice. In the first survey study, we found that lower sensitivity to hate speech was a positive mediator of the relationship between frequent exposure to hate speech and outgroup prejudice. In the second study, we obtained a crucial confirmation of these effects. After desensitization training individuals were less sensitive to hate speech and more prejudiced toward hate speech victims than their counterparts in the control condition. In the final study, we replicated several previous effects and additionally found that the effects of exposure to hate speech on prejudice were mediated by a lower sensitivity to hate speech, and not by lower sensitivity to social norms. Altogether, our studies are the first to elucidate the effects of exposure to hate speech on outgroup prejudice.",

In Study 1, an experimental design was used to test the evolutionary-based hypothesis that women would be intolerant of sexy women and would censure those who seem to make sex too readily available. Results provide strong empirical support for intrasexual competition among women. Using independent raters, blind to condition, we found that almost all women were rated as reacting negatively (\"bitchy\") to an attractive female confederate when she was dressed in a sexually provocative manner. In contrast, when she was dressed conservatively, the same confederate was barely noticed by the participants. In Study 2, an experimental design was used to assess whether the sexy female confederate from Study 1 was viewed as a sexual rival by women. Results indicated that as hypothesized, women did not want to introduce her to their boyfriend, allow him to spend time alone with her, or be friends with her.

Using structural equation analyses, delinquency, hostile masculinity, impersonal sex, and misperception of women's sexual cues were positively and directly associated with the number of sexually aggressive acts committed. There were also indirect effects of childhood victimization, personality traits associated with subclinical levels of psychopathy, and alcohol consumption.

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of bullying is essential to intervention planning and evaluation. Limitations to many currently available self-report measures of bullying victimization include a lack of psychometric information, use of the emotionally laden term \"bullying\" in definition-first approaches to self-report surveys, and not assessing all components of the definition of bullying (chronicity, intentionality, and imbalance of power) in behavioral-based self-report methods. To address these limitations, we developed the California Bullying Victimization Scale (CBVS), which is a self-report scale that measures the three-part definition of bullying without the use of the term bully. We examined test–retest reliability and the concurrent and predictive validity of the CBVS across students in Grades 5–12 in four central California schools. Concurrent validity was assessed by comparing the CBVS with a common, definition-based bullying victimization measure. Predictive validity was examined through the co-administration of measures of psychological well-being. Analysis by grade and gender are included. Results support the test–retest reliability of the CBVS over a 2-week period. The CBVS was significantly, positively correlated with another bullying assessment and was related in expected directions to measures of well-being. Implications for differentiating peer victimization and bullying victimization via self-report measures are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 37:234–247, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Sibling aggression is a common form of intra‐familial aggression, yet has been largely neglected by research. Using an inclusive measure of sibling aggression, this study investigated, firstly, prevalence of sibling aggression and associations with family and household characteristics, and secondly, the relationship between sibling aggression and peer bullying. Participants were 4,237 adolescents from Wave 1 of Understanding Society. Four types of sibling aggression were measured: physical, verbal, stealing and teasing, and combined into composite measures of victimization and perpetration. Regression analysis identified associations with demographic characteristics, family and sibling composition, parent–child relationships and socioeconomic status and explored the link between sibling aggression and involvement in peer bullying. Using a broad definition, sibling aggression was found to be widespread, with 46% of all participants being victimized and 36% perpetrating aggression. Household and family characteristics, including a large family size, male siblings, and financial difficulties were associated with greater rates of sibling aggression. Parenting behavior showed the strongest relationship: harsh parenting increased the risk of sibling aggression while positive parenting protected against it. Sibling aggression was also homotypically related to involvement in peer bullying. Victimization by siblings significantly increased the odds of being a victim of peer bullying, and perpetrators of sibling aggression were more likely to be both peer bullies and bully‐victims. Considering the adverse effects of sibling aggression on physical and mental health, the study provides pointers for efforts to reduce the risk of sibling aggression. Furthermore, the link with peer bullying suggests that school anti‐bullying efforts should also take account of children's sibling relationships. Aggr.

To date, few programs addressing cyberbullying have been developed and empirically tested. The Cyber Friendly Schools (CFS) group-randomized controlled trial measured the longitudinal impact of a whole-school online cyberbullying prevention and intervention program, developed in partnership with young people. Non-government secondary schools in Perth, Western Australia, (N = 35; 3,000+ students) were randomized to an intervention (n = 19) or usual practice control group (n = 16 schools). Students completed online questionnaires in 2010, 2011, and at 1-year follow-up in 2012, measuring their cyberbullying experiences during the previous school term. The intervention group received the program in Grades 8 and 9 (aged 13-14 years). Program effects were tested using two-part growth models. The program was associated with significantly greater declines in the odds of involvement in cyber-victimization and perpetration from pre- to the first post-test, but no other differences were evident between the study conditions. However, teachers implemented only one third of the program content. More work is needed to build teacher capacity and self-efficacy to effectively implement cyberbullying programs. Whole-school cyberbullying interventions implemented in conjunction with other bullying prevention programs may reduce cyber-victimization more than traditional school-based bullying prevention programs alone.

To account for school changes associated with the pandemic, students were randomized at the school level into two conditions: (1) the pre‐COVID‐19 condition, assessing bullying prevalence rates retrospectively before the pandemic, and (2) the current condition, assessing rates during the pandemic. Results indicated that students reported far higher rates of bullying involvement before the pandemic than during the pandemic across all forms of bullying (general, physical, verbal, and social), except for cyber bullying, where differences in rates were less pronounced. Despite anti‐Asian rhetoric during the pandemic, no difference was found between East Asian Canadian and White students on bullying victimization. Finally, our validity checks largely confirmed previous published patterns in both conditions: (1) girls were more likely to report being bullied than boys, (2) boys were more likely to report bullying others than girls, (3) elementary school students reported higher bullying involvement than secondary school students, and (4) gender diverse and LGTBQ + students reported being bullied at higher rates than students who identified as gender binary or heterosexual. These results highlight that the pandemic may have mitigated bullying rates, prompting the need to consider retaining some of the educational reforms used to reduce the spread of the virus that could foster caring interpersonal relationships at school such as reduced class sizes, increased supervision, and blended learning.",

    "abstract": "One of the oldest scientific theories of human aggression is the frustration-aggression hypothesis, advanced in 1939. Although this theory has received considerable empirical support and is alive and well today, its underlying mechanisms have not been adequately explored. In this article, we examine major findings and concepts from extant psychological research on hostile aggression and offer an integrative conception: aggression is a primordial means for establishing one's sense of significance and mattering, thus addressing a fundamental social-psychological need. Our functional portrayal of aggression as a means to significance yields four testable hypotheses: (1) frustration will elicit hostile aggression proportionately to the extent that the frustrated goal serves the individual's need for significance, (2) the impulse to aggress in response to significance loss will be enhanced in conditions that limit the individual's ability to reflect and engage in extensive information processing (that may bring up alternative, socially condoned means to significance), (3) significance-reducing frustration will elicit hostile aggression unless the impulse to aggress is substituted by a nonaggressive means of significance restoration, (4) apart from significance loss, an opportunity for significance gain can increase the impulse to aggress. These hypotheses are supported by extant data as well as novel research findings in real-world contexts. They have important implications for understanding human aggression and the conditions under which it is likely to be manifested and reduced.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study had two aims: to evaluate the relationship between bullying and psychiatric disorders and to study the probability of using mental health services among children involved in bully/victim problems. The data consisted of interviews with 423 parents and 420 children. Diagnostic measures were based on the Isle of Wight Interview. Children involved in bullying as bullies, bully‐victims, and victims were compared with other children. Children involved in bully/victim problems were more prone to have psychiatric disorders than noninvolved children. The probability of being disturbed was highest among male bullies, followed by male bully‐victims and female victims (9.5‐fold, 7.9‐fold, and 4.3‐fold, respectively) compared with noninvolved same‐sex children. The most common diagnoses among children involved in bully/victim problems were attention deficit disorder, oppositional/conduct disorder, and depression. Furthermore, children involved in bully/victim problems were more likely to have used mental health services at some time during their lives and also during the previous 3 months. Special attention should be paid to children’s mental health when dealing with bullying problems at school. Referral pathways to mental health services and factors affecting the referral processes among children should be further studied. Aggr. Behav. 27:102–110, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Drivers were interviewed over cellular telephones in high- and low-congestion conditions during a single commute. During each interview, state measures of driver stress and driver behaviors were obtained. Behavior responses were subdivided into six categories: aggressive, information seeking, planning, minor self-destructive, distraction, and relaxation techniques. Both state driver stress and aggression were greater in high- than in low-congestion conditions. No other behavior category differed between low and high congestion. Multiple regressions were calculated to determine the predictors of state driver stress. In low congestion, time urgency predicted state driver stress, while aggression predicted driver stress in high congestion. In both conditions, a trait susceptibility toward viewing driving as generally stressful was predictive of state driver stress levels, which further strengthens the use of the Driving Behaviour Inventory—General as a predictor of \"trait\" driver stress. Females and males did not differentiate on state stress or any behavior category. Aggr. Behav. 25:409–423, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

On the basis of a peer nomination questionnaire [Salmivalli et al., 1996; Sutton and Smith, 1999], children from three different cities (Seville, Florence, and Cosenza) were assigned to one of three different status groups: bullies, victims, or outsiders. Subsequently they were interviewed about their feelings in relation to the task of putting themselves in the role of the bully in a bullying scenario. Specifically, emotions such as guilt and shame, expressed in a sense of moral responsibility, and indifference and pride, expressed in an attitude of moral disengagement, were investigated. Results showed significant differences between bullies, victims, and outsiders, with regard to moral disengagement, at both the affective and cognitive levels. Across the three cities, bullies, as compared to victims and outsiders, showed a higher level of disengagement emotions and motives when they were asked to put themselves in the role of bully. At a more detailed level, analyses of specific mechanisms of moral disengagement revealed that bullies possessed a main profile of egocentric reasoning. Besides the differences between bullies and victims, cross‐cultural differences were also present. Compared to children from Seville, children from the south of Italy (Cosenza) attributed higher disengagement to the bullies. Findings are discussed in relation to specific cultural characteristics of this area. Aggr. Behav. 29:515–530, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

This was a subsample of students taking part in an earlier study [Salmivalli et al., 1996a]. In addition to studying stability per se, the impact of social environment on adolescents' behavior was explored. This was done, first, by comparing a group of adolescents who had moved to a new class with others whose current class consisted of their former classmates, with respect to stability in their social behavior. Second, regression analyses were conducted in which the behavior of adolescents' current peers was used as a possible predictor of their social behavior, along with their own sixth-grade behavior. The results showed a moderate consistency in the participant roles the students take on. Some gender-related findings emerged: for instance, the occurrence of bullying showed more stability among boys than among girls, and girls but not boys showed consistency in the tendency to defend the bullied victims. Especially among girls, the behavior of current peers was in many cases an even better predictor of how they tended to behave in bullying situations in the eighth grade than was their own former behavior.

    "abstract": "Abstract Models are presented describing how bullying others and being bullied are related to proactive and reactive aggressiveness. This was investigated among 1801 pupils in Norwegian schools at the end of grade five and among 2083 pupils at the end of grade eight. Pupils in the two samples were approximately 11 and 14 years old, respectively. The procedure of structural equation modeling with latent variables was followed using LISREL 8.30 to estimate the parameters. Analyses were conducted for boys and girls separately at fifth and eighth grades. Support for the assumptions of factor solution and factorial invariance of the concepts across gender and age was obtained independently from estimating structural parameters. Both proactive and reactive aggressiveness were related to bullying others and to being bullied at Level 5. Among the older pupils, there was a strong relationship between proactive aggressiveness and bullying others, while reactive aggressiveness was much more weakly related to bullying others. Being bullied, on the other hand, was only weakly related to proactive and reactive aggressiveness among the older pupils. Age was therefore an important factor in determining how proactive and reactive aggressiveness were related to bullying. When pupil gender is concerned, power‐related proactive aggressiveness in predicting bullying was a more important factor for boys, while affiliation‐related proactive aggressiveness was a more powerful factor for girls.

    "abstract": "Abstract Research suggests that the relationship between school bullying and its various risk factors should be clearer among girls than boys, and should become stronger with age, as roles within the peer group stabilise. This paper tests this theory by comparing sex, school type, and bully/victim status differences in friendships and playground social interactions, using data from nine surveys in seven countries: China, England, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and Spain. A total of approximately 48,000 children completed various translations of the Olweus Bullying Questionnaire. Small but generally consistent main effects were found for sex and school type (boys and primary pupils enjoyed playtimes more and had more friends, but were also more likely to spend playtimes alone). Larger effects were consistently found for bully/victim status (victims were significantly worse off on all the measures in all the samples where a difference was found, while bullies and neutrals did not differ consistently), but the interactions between these factors varied widely between samples and there were few consistent patterns. It is concluded that bullying is a universal phenomenon with many negative correlates for victims and few (if any) for bullies, but that there are cultural variations in the way that bullying is related to sex, age, and social support.

An anonymous survey of 2,437 students in six middle schools identified 898 students who had been bullied, including 25% who had not told anyone that they were bullied and 40% who had not told an adult about their victimization. We investigated chronicity and type of bullying, school climate, familial, demographic, and attitudinal factors that influenced victim reporting to anyone versus no one, to adults versus no one, and to adults versus peers. Logistic regression analyses indicated that reporting increased with the chronicity of victimization. Reporting was generally more frequent among girls than boys, and among lower grade levels. Students who perceived the school climate to be tolerant of bullying, and students who described their parents as using coercive discipline were less likely to report being bullied.

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study addressed empathy's role in conflict resolution within the context of adolescent same‐sex friendship relations. Self‐report questionnaires were used to assess dispositional affective empathy and conflict resolution styles (problem solving, conflict engagement, withdrawal and compliance). The data of 307 adolescents (149 boys, 158 girls) were included in a multigroup path analysis with sex as a moderator variable. In agreement with the hypothesis that higher levels of dispositional empathy are associated with more successful conflict management, dispositional affective empathy was found to be positively linked to problem solving and negatively linked to conflict engagement among adolescent boys and girls. Dispositional affective empathy was not related to the two more passive strategies (withdrawal and compliance). Sex differences were demonstrated in empathic tendencies, with girls being more empathic than boys. Sex differences were also established in conflict resolution strategies, with girls using problem solving, withdrawal and compliance more frequently than boys. Both sexes scored equally low on conflict engagement, however, and were found to prefer problem solving to all other conflict resolution strategies. Findings are discussed in terms of previous research on empathy and conflict resolution. Aggr. Behav. 33:48–55, 2007. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss; Inc.",

    "abstract": "The studies presented in this paper examined empathy, especially perspective taking, as a potential inhibitor of interpersonal aggression. The theoretical rationale for these investigations derived from Zillmann's [(1988): Aggressive Behavior 14: 51–64] cognitive excitation model. Study 1 revealed that dispositional empathy correlates negatively with self-reported aggression and with conflict responses that reflect little concern for the needs of the other party. Empathy also was positively related to constructive responses to interpersonal conflict (i. e., those that do involve concern for the needs of the other party). In Study 2, perspective taking was manipulated with instructions to subjects prior to participation in a reaction-time task designed to measure aggression. When threat was relatively low, subjects who were instructed to take the perspective of the target responded less aggressively than did those who had been instructed to focus on the task. Study 3 examined the effect of dispositional perspective taking on verbal aggression. Threat was manipulated in terms of the combination of provocation and gender of the interactants. As predicted, perspective taking related to aggression inhibition under conditions of moderate threat–for males under low provocation and females under high provocation. These effects were predicted and explained in the context of the cognitive-excitation model. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

We also examined whether this association was mediated by early aggressive behavior, adult antisocial personality disorder, hostility, and problem drinking for men and women. The sample consisted of individuals who had official records of child abuse and/or neglect prior to age 12 and matched controls who were followed up and interviewed at approximately age 29 years. Individuals who had ever been married or lived with someone (N=961) reported on lifetime perpetration of IPV. For the total sample, abused and neglected children reported significantly higher rates of ever hitting or throwing things at a partner, ever hitting or throwing first, and ever hitting or throwing first more than once. Both male and female abused and neglected children reported significantly higher rates of ever hitting or throwing things at a partner than matched controls. Antisocial personality disorder mediated the effects of abuse/neglect on IPV for men and women and hostility and alcohol problems also mediated the effects for abused and neglected women. Early aggressive behavior was not a significant mediator for either gender. Overall the results reveal a link between early childhood victimization and later perpetration of violence against partners for both men and women.

We found moderate levels of continuity of aggression from age 8 to 48 both for males and for females. Contrary to what some have proposed, we found that continuity of aggressiveness is owing to not only the high‐aggressive participants staying high but also owing to the low‐aggressive participants staying low. Compared with life‐course‐persistent low aggressives, we found that life‐course‐persistent high aggressives had consistently poorer outcomes across domains of life success, criminal behavior, and psychosocial functioning at age 48 (e.g., arrests, traffic violations, aggression toward spouse and divorces, depression, health, occupational and educational attainment). In contrast, adolescent‐limited and child‐limited aggressives did not differ from life‐course‐persistent low aggressives on the age 48 outcomes. Finally, the outcomes for late‐onset (early adulthood) aggressives were also problematic in some domains though not as problematic as those for life‐course‐persistent aggressives. Aggr.

Specifically, the aims of the intervention were (1) to reduce bullying episodes through developing in bullies an awareness of their own and others' behaviour, (2) to enhance children's capacity to offer support to the victims of bullying, (3) to enhance responsibility and involvement on the part of bystanders, (4) to improve the quality of interpersonal relationships in the class group, and (5) to analyse possible age and gender differences related to the effect of intervention. Two middle schools from central Italy took part in the study (age range of pupils, 11–14 years). In the two schools, nine classes (94 boys and 84 girls ) were part of the experimental group, whereas the remaining five classes formed the control group (63 boys and 52 girls). The intervention was implemented for one school year, from October 1998 to May 1999. Before and after the intervention, two measures were administered in the experimental and control classes: (1) a questionnaire on the participants' roles in bully/victim relationships, originally developed by Salmivalli et al. [1996: Aggressive Behavior 22:1–15] and revised for younger children by Sutton and Smith [1999: Aggressive Behavior 25:97–111], and (2) a questionnaire on attitudes toward bullying—an Italian questionnaire comprising 11 attitude items previously developed [Menesini E, et al. 1997: EARLI Conference] on the basis of Rigby and Slee's [1991: Journal of Social Psychology 131:615–627] pro‐victim scale. Given the within‐subjects design of the study, a MANOVA was run using time as the within‐subjects factor and sex and age as between‐subject factors. The results of this short‐term study highlight the fact that a befriending intervention had a positive effect on the experimental classes, preventing the increase of negative behaviours and attitudes reported in the group that did not receive the intervention. The findings that related to the pro‐bullying roles and to the role of outsiders are particularly relevant since these roles remained stable or decreased in the experimental group, whereas they clearly increased in the control group. The opposite trend was registered for children's pro‐victim attitude, which shows a decrease in the control sample and good stability in the experimental group. On the whole, the intervention seemed to prevent the escalation of negative behaviours and attitudes that often develop spontaneously in young people of this age. Aggr.

We also assessed the perceived harmfulness of each item. Comparing these findings with the occurrence of aggression on television, we found that adolescents were exposed to nearly 10 times more indirect, relational, and social aggression on television than they are in school. Overall, there was no sex difference in the amount of aggression reported by boys and girls. However, when examining specific items, girls reported more gossiping and boys more hitting. Girls perceived indirect, direct relational, and verbal aggression as more harmful than did boys. Limited evidence was found for a distinction between indirect, relational, and social aggression, although it was clear that they were more similar than different. Aggr.

To overcome these limitations, we developed a new method for measuring aggression, specifically, the amount of hot sauce administered to a target known to dislike spicy foods. We summarize a series of experiments assessing theory-based hypotheses regarding aggression in which this measure is employed.

    "abstract": "Longitudinal linkages between intentional exposure to x-rated material and sexually aggressive behavior were examined among youth 10–15 year olds surveyed nationally in the United States. At Wave 1 in 2006, participants (n = 1,588) were queried about these exposures and outcomes in the preceding 12 months. Wave 2 data (n = 1,206) were collected approximately 12 months after Wave 1 and Wave 3 data (n = 1,159) were collected approximately 24 months after Wave 1. Thus, data for this project represent a 36-month time frame. A marginal model with generalized estimating equations was used to represent the population-average odds of sexually aggressive behavior over the 36 months as a function of exposure to x-rated material over the same time and to account for clustering in the data within person over time. An average of 5% of youth reported perpetrating sexually aggressive behavior and 23% of youth reported intentional exposure to x-rated material. After adjusting for other potentially influential proximal (i.e., sexual aggression victimization) and distal characteristics (e.g., substance use), we found that intentional exposure to violent x-rated material over time predicted an almost 6-fold increase in the odds of self-reported sexually aggressive behavior (aOR: 5.8, 95% CI: 3.2, 10.5), whereas exposure to nonviolent x-rated material was not statistically significantly related (aOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.94, 2.9). Associations were similar for boys and girls (boys nonviolent x-rated material aOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 0.8, 4.7; violent x-rated material aOR = 6.5, 95% CI: 2.7, 15.3; girls nonviolent x-rated material aOR = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.5, 3.2; violet x-rated material aOR = 6.1, 95% CI: 2.5, 14.8).

The interactive relations between gender and social anxiety, and between gender and empathy, were also assessed. In addition to the gender and overt aggression covariates, fear of negative evaluation and perspective taking were unique predictors of relational aggression. Males, students who were more overtly aggressive, and those who reported greater fear of negative evaluation were more relationally aggressive than were peers. Students with higher levels of perspective taking reported using less relational aggression than did peers. A gender x empathetic concern interaction indicated that for males only, lower levels of empathetic concern were associated with higher levels of relational aggression.

In this study, 260 subjects were identified as physically abused, psychologically abused, both physically and psychologically abused, or nonabused, based on responses to the Child Abuse Questionnaire (CAQ). Subjects were tested for levels of nonclinical depression via the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), for levels of self-esteem via the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), and for the adaptiveness of attributional style via the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ). It was hypothesized that each of the three abuse groups would differ from the control group on the three dependent measures; differences among the three abuse groups were also explored. Three one-way analyses of variance indicated that (1) BDI scores reflected a greater tendency toward depression in subjects reporting both types of abuse than in nonabused subjects or in subjects reporting either psychological or physical abuse, (2) subjects reporting psychological abuse only or both psychological and physical abuse showed lower self-esteem than did nonabused subjects, and (3) abused subjects did not seem to exhibit a more maladaptive attributional style than that of nonabused subjects. In addition, multiple linear regression analyses pointed to psychological abuse as a critical variable in predicting levels of depression, self-esteem, and attributional style, when physical abuse effects were controlled. Controlling for the effects of psychological abuse, however, indicated that physical abuse did not significantly contribute to the variance in these variables.

Further analyses revealed that the predictive utility of pornography was due to its discriminative ability only among men classified (based on their other risk characteristics) at relatively high risk for sexual aggression. Other analyses indicated that the specific risk factors accounted for more variance in sexual aggression than the general risk factors and mediated the association between the general risk factors and sexual aggression.

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which direct and indirect bullying and victimization at school affects the mental and physical health of 661 Italian boys and girls, aged 11 to 15 years old. The impact of bullying and victimization is assessed by taking into account the relative buffering effect of a positive relationship with one or both parents. Internalizing symptoms such as withdrawn behaviors, somatic complaints, and anxiety and depression, measured with the self‐administered Youth Form of the Achenbach's Child Behavioral Checklist, are indicators of maladjustment. Multiple regression analyses revealed that being a girl is a strong significant risk factor for all internalizing symptoms. Being a victim of indirect bullying is the strongest predictor of withdrawn behaviors, somatic complaints, and anxiety/depression, independent of direct victimization, which significantly predicts somatic complaints, anxiety, and depression, but not withdrawn behaviors. Bullying others directly by hitting, threatening, or calling names is not a significant predictor the poor mental and somatic health of youngsters, whereas indirect bullying (spreading rumors or not talking to someone on purpose) does significantly predict anxiety and depression, as well as withdrawn behaviors. The negative impact of victimization and bullying is buffered by youngsters' positive relationship with one or both parents. Recommendations are provided with regard to possible intervention strategies underlying the importance of distinguishing between different forms of bullying and victimization and providing social support in each different case.

Using a semi‐parametric group‐based modeling approach, two distinct trajectories were identified: “increasing users” comprising of 35% of the sample and “stable low users” comprising of 65% of the sample. Using logistic regression analyses to distinguish these two groups, we found that for girls, more frequent, increasing use of indirect aggression was associated with prior prosocial and physically aggressive behavior, low SES and low parental social support at age 2. For boys, increasing use of indirect aggression was associated with prior parenting issues at age 2—inconsistency and less positive parent–child interactions. Although this study provides unique information regarding the early development of indirect aggression and its predictors, more longitudinal research is needed to fully understand its development.

A total of 154 male motorists completed two subscales of the Hypermasculinity Inventory as a measure of macho personality and self‐reports of aggressive driving behavior based on the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire. They also provided information about their age, annual mileage, horsepower of their car, and features that had guided their choice of a car. A multiple regression analysis showed that each of the predictors was significantly related to aggressive driving: Younger motorists, those driving powerful cars, and those showing macho personality were significantly more likely to report driving aggression. Together, the three predictors accounted for 35.8% of the variance. In addition, macho men assigned greater importance to speed and sportiness of a car and less importance to safety aspects than nonmacho men.

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper reports results from analyses of the physical aggression against dating partners by four samples of university students in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Mexican Americans and Non‐Mexican Whites in El Paso and Lubbock Texas, and New Hampshire ( N =1,544). The percent reporting partner violence (PV) was high in all samples, but also differed significantly between samples. The lowest rate was in New Hampshire (29.7%), followed by Texas, Non‐Mexican Whites (30.9%), Texas Mexican American (34.2%), and the highest rate was in Juarez (46.1%). When only severe assaults were compared, the differences between samples was similar, i.e., lowest in New Hampshire and highest in Juarez. In all four samples, there was no significant difference between males and females in either the overall prevalence of physical aggression or the prevalence of severe attacks. Among the 553 couples where one or both of the partners were violent, in almost three quarters of the cases (71.2%) there was gender symmetry in the sense that both partners engaged in this type of behavior. When only one partner was violent, this was twice as likely to be the female partner (19.0%) as the male partner (9.8%). Among the 205 couples where there was an act of severe aggression, symmetry was less prevalent (56.6%), but when only one partner was violent, it was again twice as likely to be the female partner (29.8% female only versus 13.7 male partner only). These results are consistent with the gender symmetry in PV found in many studies. They extend those results by showing that gender symmetry prevails in four different cultural contexts. The presence of gender symmetry in these different cultural contexts, combined with studies showing that women are injured more often and more seriously by partner‐assaults, and studies showing that women initiate PV as often as men, suggests that programs and policies aimed at primary prevention of PV by women are crucial to ending PV and for reducing the victimization of men and women.

Hypotheses were generated from recent theory pertinent to the categorization and measurement of aggressive behavior as well as widely supported effects of alcohol intoxication and gender on aggression. Participants were 328 (163 men and 165 women) healthy social drinkers between 21 and 35 years of age who completed self‐report personality inventories designed to assess one's propensity toward direct physical aggression, verbal aggression, trait anger, and hostility. Following the consumption of either an alcohol or a placebo beverage, participants were tested on the TAP, in which mild electric shocks were received from, and administered to, a fictitious opponent during a competitive task. Direct physical aggression was operationalized as the shock intensities (i.e., first trial shock intensity, mean shock intensity, proportion of highest shock) administered to the fictitious opponent. Although all self‐report measures were significantly associated with the three TAP indices, the associations involving physical aggression were strongest. In addition, self‐report measures of physical aggression consistently predicted higher levels of aggression on the TAP indices in men, compared with women, and in intoxicated, relative to sober, participants. Taken as a whole, this pattern of findings provides further evidence for the validity of the TAP as a measure of direct physical aggression for men and women. Aggr.

In 1987, Palmstierna and Wistedt [Acta Psychiatr Scand 76:657-663] introduced the Staff Observation Aggression Scale (SOAS), an instrument for monitoring the frequency, nature, and severity of aggressive incidents. In the present study, the validity of the SOAS severity scoring system was examined, and the severity scores were refined. The SOAS was used to record aggression on six closed wards of three psychiatric hospitals. The SOAS severity scores of 556 aggressive incidents were compared with severity estimates given on Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) by staff members. The original SOAS scores were found to be moderately correlated with the estimates of severity given by staff on the VAS. The SOAS severity scoring system was refined on the basis of the staff severity estimates. The revised scoring method and other refinements in the contents of the instrument led to the construction of the SOAS-R. The SOAS-R seems to be a promising tool for monitoring a wide range of (self-) destructive acts on psychiatric wards. Aggr. Behav. 25:197–209, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Agreeableness was the personality dimension of focus because this dimension is associated with motives to maintain positive interpersonal relations. In two studies, middle school children were assessed on the Big Five domains of personality. Study 1 showed that agreeableness was associated with both indirect and direct aggression. In addition, the link between agreeableness and aggression was strongest for direct strategies. Study 2 examined the hypotheses that agreeableness predicts social cognitions associated with aggression, peer reports of direct aggression, and teacher reports of adjustment. Agreeableness predicted peer reports of aggression and social cognitions associated with aggression. In addition, aggression mediated the link between agreeableness and adjustment. Results suggest that of the Big Five dimensions, Agreeableness is most closely associated with processes and outcomes related to aggression in adolescents. Aggr.

    "abstract": "A familicide is a multiple-victim homicide incident in which the killer's spouse and one or more children are slain. National archives of Canadian and British homicides, containing 109 familicide incidents, permit some elucidation of the characteristic and epidemiology of this crime. Familicides were almost exclusively perpetrated by men, unlike other spouse-killings and other filicides. Half the familicidal men killed themselves as well, a much higher rate of suicide than among other uxoricidal or filicidal men. De facto unions were overrepresented, compared to their prevalence in the populations-at-large, but to a much lesser extent in familicides than in other uxoricides. Stepchildren were overrepresented as familicide victims, compared to their numbers in the populations-at-large, but to a much lesser extent than in other filicides; unlike killers of their genetic offspring, men who killed their stepchildren were rarely suicidal. An initial binary categorization of familicides as accusatory versus despondent is tentatively proposed. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, 411 South London males have been followed up from age 8 to 48 in repeated personal interviews. There was considerable continuity in offending over time. Persistent offenders had the longest criminal careers (averaging 18.4 years), and most of them had convictions for violence. Persistent offenders were leading the most unsuccessful lives at ages 32 and 48, although all categories of males became more successful with age. By age 48, the life success of adolescence-limited offenders was similar to that of nonoffenders. The most important risk factors at ages 8-18 that predicted which offenders would persist after age 21 were heavy drinking at age 18, hyperactivity at ages 12-14, and low popularity and harsh discipline at ages 8-10. The most important risk factors that predicted which nonoffenders would onset after age 21 were poor housing and low nonverbal IQ at ages 8-10, high neuroticism at age 16, and anti-establishment attitudes and motoring convictions at age 18. It was suggested that nervousness and neuroticism may have protected children at risk from offending in adolescence and the teenage years.",

Trajectories for both forms of aggression were estimated first separately, then jointly. Mean levels of both social and physical aggression decreased over time for the overall sample, but with high variability of individual trajectories. Subgroups followed high trajectories for both social and physical aggression. Joint estimation yielded six trajectories: low stable, low increasers, medium increasers, medium desisters, high desisters, and high increasers. Membership in the high increaser group was predicted by male gender, unmarried parents, African American ethnicity, and maternal authoritarian and permissive parenting. Permissive parenting also predicted membership in the medium increaser group. This is one of the first studies to examine social aggression longitudinally across this developmental period. Though the results challenge the claim that social aggression is at its peak in early adolescence, the findings emphasize the importance of considering different developmental trajectories in trying to understand origins and outcomes of aggression.",

In this article, we report the findings from an investigation into employees' perceptions of social and organizational work conditions and experiences of bullying at work. Six‐hundred‐seventy‐seven employees from five different working populations (managers, teachers, technicians, call centre operators, and engineers) completed the Workplace Relationships Questionnaire (WRQ). This paper presents the results of the analysis, linking the experiences of bullying and perceptions of social and organizational work conditions. The present findings predictably identify victims and non‐bullied participants, and also indicate the existence of a new category of employee affected by the problem of bullying; bullied/non‐victims. Bullied/non‐victims may provide crucial insights into the ways that company practices and policies impact negatively on the whole workforce. Aggr. Behav. 29:489–496, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Reactions to harassment of victims of bullying were studied. One issue was, what kind of behavior on the part of the victim is likely to a) make the others start or continue bullying or b) diminish bullying or put an end to it. Altogether 573 pupils (286 girls, 287 boys) from 11 Finnish schools served as subjects: 67 of them (33 girls, 34 boys) were identified as victims of bullying. Both peer- and self-evaluations were used as methods of the study. Three subscales, describing counteraggressive, helpless, and nonchalant behavioral responses to bullying were established on the basis of peer-evaluations of the victims' behavior. Three different subtypes of victims (the Counteraggressive, the Helpless, and the Nonchalant) were identified. Helplessness and nonchalance were found to be typical responses of the girl victims, while boy victims tended to react to bullying with counteraggression or nonchalance. The victims' self-evaluations of their behavior supported these views. Helplessness and counteraggression in the case of girl victims and counteraggression in the case of boy victims were perceived as making the bullying start or continue. The absence of helplessness in the case of girl victims, and nonchalance as well as the absence of counteraggression in the case of boy victims were perceived as making the bullying diminish or stop. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Appeasement begins when the conditions of social relations lead one individual to anticipate aggression from others, is expressed in submissive, inhibited behavior, which in turn evokes inferences and emotions in others that bring about social reconciliation. Our empirical review focuses on two classes of human appeasement: reactive forms of appeasement, including embarrassment and shame, which placate others after social transgressions; and anticipatory forms of appeasement, including polite modesty and shyness, which reduce the likelihood of social conflict and aggression. Our review of the empirical evidence indicates that embarrassment, shame, modesty, and shyness share the eliciting conditions, submissive behavior, and social consequences of appeasement. We conclude by discussing social processes that allow humans to appease one another, such as teasing, and those that prevent appeasement, such as legal and negotiation practices, to the benefit and detriment of human relations.

Over a shorter period of years cognitive rehearsal of aggressive behaviors predicted overt aggression, was predicted by overt aggression, and correlated with the child's TV viewing. In combination, these data suggest a circular process in which scripts for aggressive behavior are learned at an early age and become more firmly entrenched as the child develops, so that aggression becomes self-perpetuating in children with certain cognitive characteristics.",

The aims of this study were to (1) investigate moral disengagement among children for whom self‐reported and peer‐nominated bully status diverged and (2) compare levels of disengagement among self‐reported and peer‐nominated pure bullies, pure victims, bully–victims, and children not involved in bullying. A sample of 739 Danish sixth grade and seventh grade children (mean age 12.6) was included in the study. Moral disengagement was measured using a Danish version of the Moral Disengagement Scale and bullying was measured using both self‐reports and peer nominations. Results revealed that both self‐reported and peer‐nominated bullying were related to moral disengagement, and that both pure bullies and bully–victims displayed higher moral disengagement than outsiders. Discrepancies between self‐reported and peer‐nominated bullying involvement indicates that a person's social reputation has a stronger association with moral disengagement than so far expected.

    "abstract": "The primary purpose of the study was to test a hypothetical model for aggressive and delinquent conduct problems in adolescence. A total of 168 adolescents from 121 families were studied using several questionnaires and a semi-structured interview. The following factors were considered: obstetric complications, temperament (novelty-seeking), self-esteem, family influences (perceived parenting, alcohol abuse/dependence of parents, antisocial personality disorder of the father) and peer-group characteristics (peer rejection and membership in a deviant peer group). The evaluation methods applied included correlation analyses and testing of two hypothetical models using structural equation modeling. The correlation analyses revealed significant relationships between adolescent aggressive and delinquent behavioral problems and parental antisocial behavior; perceived parental rejection and low emotional warmth; adolescent novelty-seeking, self-esteem, peer rejection and peer deviance. The two empirical models, separately for aggressive and delinquent behavior problems, revealed direct relationships between paternal antisocial behavior, parental rejection, adolescent novelty seeking, peer deviance, peer rejection, and offspring aggression and delinquency. There were, however, two differences with respect to the relationships between peer rejection, peer deviance, aggression and delinquency. First, peer rejection was more strongly associated with aggressive behavior and only moderately linked to delinquency. Second, deviance in the peer-group was found to be closely related with delinquency but only moderately with aggression. Our findings suggest that several pathways for aggressive and delinquent conduct problems are comparable while others were not. Regarding the findings of the empirical models, we conclude that only intervention measures that include parents, peers and individual adolescents may help decrease the incidence of aggressive and delinquent conduct problems.

Winners had higher overall T levels than losers, with no significant difference between Close Contest or Decisive Victory conditions. In contrast, C levels did not differ between winners and losers nor did Condition (Close or Decisive) have any effect. Mood was depressed in Decisive losers compared to all other groups.

Children's self‐report of self‐esteem and parent and teacher report of dimensions of psychopathy [narcissism, callous–unemotional (CU) traits, and impulsivity], proactive and reactive aggression, and conduct problems were collected. Composites of parent and teacher ratings of children's behavior were used. Consistent with the study's hypotheses, narcissism predicted unique variance in both proactive and reactive aggression, even when controlling for other dimensions of psychopathy, demographic variables associated with narcissism, and the alternative subtype of aggression. As hypothesized, impulsivity was significantly associated with only reactive aggression. CU traits were not related to proactive or reactive aggression once the control variables were entered. All dimensions of psychopathy predicted unique variance in conduct problems. Consistent with prediction, narcissism was not significantly related to general self‐esteem, providing support that narcissism and self‐esteem are different constructs. Furthermore, narcissism and self‐esteem related differentially to proactive aggression, reactive aggression, and conduct problems. Furthermore, narcissism but not self‐esteem accounted for unique variance in aggression and conduct problems. The importance of narcissism in the prediction of aggressive behaviors and clinical implications are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 33:1–13, 2007. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss; Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Most research into peer victimisation has focussed on children aged 8 years and above and has included a study of the correlates of victimisation, including cognitive and social skills, and attachment profiles. Recent research has started to investigate aggression and victimisation in younger groups and has found that the nature of aggression differs from that in older children in terms of the types of victimisation involved and the stability of the roles. This study investigated some of the correlates of roles taken in victimisation in 104 children aged 4–6 years, using a cartoon methodology to elicit peer nominations for aggressor, victim, and defender. It examined the social cognitive abilities, executive function skills, and attachment profiles of aggressors, victims, and defenders. Victims did not exhibit poor performance on the social cognitive tasks or have insecure attachment qualities as has been found with victims during middle childhood. Aggressors did not perform highly on the social cognitive tasks in contrast to older aggressors and bullies. Defenders were found to perform above average (although not significantly different from other groups) on the social cognitive tasks. These findings are related to the nature of aggression and victimisation at this age, and a developmental change hypothesis is proposed to accommodate them. Aggr.

Findings were broadly similar in most respects, in the two countries. Teachers were thought to intervene fairly often, other children more rarely. Most children had sympathetic attitudes and behaviour toward victims of bullying, but a significant minority, including many self-reported bullies, did not. Girls were more empathic to victims than boys, but were not more likely to intervene. The main cultural difference was that older Italian children were more empathic than younger children, with the reverse difference in England. However in both countries, the likelihood of reported intervention was less with older children.

    "abstract": "Computer-assisted self-interviews were completed with a random sample of 163 unmarried Caucasian and African American men in a large metropolitan area. Almost a quarter (24.5%) of these men acknowledged committing an act since the age of 14 that met standard legal definitions of attempted or completed rape; an additional 39% had committed another type of sexual assault involving forced sexual contact or verbal coercion. An expanded version of the Malamuth et al. [1991] confluence model was examined using path analysis. The number of sexual assaults perpetrated by participants was associated with the direct or indirect effects of childhood sexual abuse, adolescent delinquency, alcohol problems, sexual dominance, positive attitudes about casual sexual relationships, and pressure from peers to engage in sexual relationships. Additionally, empathy buffered the relationship between sexual dominance and perpetration. The pattern of results was highly similar for African American and Caucasian men. The implications of these findings for sexual assault measurement are discussed and suggestions are made for alternative treatment programs. Aggr. Behav. 00:1–14, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to explore relations of emotional empathy (two scales) with aggression and violence (three scales). An initial study investigated validity of one of the violence scales, the Risk of Eruptive Violence Scale (REV), by comparing individual REV scores with individual histories of criminal violence for a sample of incarcerated juveniles. Validity of the REV was supported by a very strong correlation of .71 between REV scores and the amount of criminal violence in this homogeneous sample. The second study yielded positive intercorrelations among measures of aggression and violence, positive intercorrelations among measures of emotional empathy, and negative correlations (ranging from –.22 to –.50, P < .05) of measures of aggression and violence with measures of emotional empathy. Analyses of the five scales in terms of the Pleasure-Arousability-Dominance (PAD) Temperament Model helped explain similarities of the emotional empathy scales with other individual difference measures of prosocial orientation (e.g., affiliation). PAD analyses also explained some paradoxical effects of experimental \"empathy arousal\" on aggression toward victims. Aggr. Behav. 23:433–445, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In this study, we examined the relation between exposure to maternal vs. paternal physical IPV and adolescent girls' and boys' aggressive behavior toward mothers, fathers, friends, and romantic partners. We also assessed the influence of PTSD (as assessed by the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents‐IV (DICA‐IV)) on the relation between exposure to IPV and aggressive behavior. Participants were 63 girls and 49 boys, ages 13–18, consecutively admitted to a youth correctional facility or assessment facility designated to serve aggressive and delinquent youth. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate unique relations between exposure to maternal vs. paternal IPV and youth aggression in relationships. Girls who observed their mothers' aggressive behavior toward partners were significantly more aggressive toward friends. Similarly, boys who witnessed their fathers' aggression were significantly more aggressive toward friends. Adolescent girls and boys who observed aggression by mothers toward partners reported significantly higher levels of aggression toward their romantic partners. Approximately one third of our sample met PTSD criteria; the relation between exposure to parental IPV and aggression was stronger for individuals who met criteria for PTSD. The implications of understanding the relations between parents' and their daughters' and sons' use of aggression are discussed within the context of providing support for families in breaking intergenerational patterns of violence and aggression.

    "abstract": "During the last two decades, much research has focused on the mechanisms used by nonhuman primates for conflict resolution. Reconciliation, i.e., a friendly reunion between former opponents, has been reported in several primate species. Reconciliation seems to serve at least two functions. According to the Valuable Relationship Hypothesis, reconciliation restores the disturbed relationship between former opponents and, consequently, occurs more often between individuals with more valuable relationships. The Uncertainty-Reduction Hypothesis emphasizes the function of reconciliation to reduce anxiety and uncertainty in the recipient of aggression following a conflict. The study of post-conflict emotionality facilitates the integration of these two hypotheses. The present study focuses on the factors affecting post-conflict anxiety of the two former opponents. Post-conflict data of captive Barbary (Macaca sylvanus) and long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are used here to examine patterns of anxiety-related behavior, such as self-scratching. The fact that in the first minutes following a conflict not only recipients of aggression but aggressors too increased the rate of scratching above baseline levels suggests that the risk of renewed attacks is unlikely to be the only reason for post-conflict anxiety. The quality of the relationship between former opponents was a good predictor of post-conflict scratching rates by the recipient of aggression: Rates were higher after conflicts between individuals with stronger affiliative relationships. This result was not due to differential risk of resuming hostilities or arousal resulting from the intensity of the previous conflict. This finding suggests that the disturbance of a valuable relationship due to the previous conflict (e.g., the potential loss of benefits provided by such relationships) is a major cause of post-conflict anxiety. In line with the Uncertainty-Reduction Hypothesis, the best way to cope with post-conflict anxiety is to reconcile and therefore restore the relationship. Higher levels of post-conflict anxiety should lead therefore to higher conciliatory tendency. This interpretation is supported by the fact that individuals with strong affiliative relationships reconcile more frequently than others, as predicted by the Valuable Relationship Hypothesis. The mediating role of emotions, such as post-conflict anxiety, is probably not limited to reconciliation. Other post-conflict interactions, such as consolation, triadic reconciliation, and mediation, are also likely to be better understood if future studies focus on the post-conflict emotions of the opponents and bystanders.

Special attention is given to the anger- and aggression-diminishing capacity of the cognitive reassessment of endangering conditions, and to impulsive destructive behaviors that result from the transitory impairment of cognitive functioning at extreme levels of excitation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study was set up with two aims in mind. First, to assess the psychometric characteristics of a peer‐report measure of bullying in a Dutch sample, and second, to compare relative and absolute ways of assigning roles in the bullying process. The sample consisted of 242 children (51% boys; mean age approximately 10 years) at T1. Two years later, there were 247 children (49% boys). We made use of an adaptation of the original Participant Role Scales (PRS) Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist et al., 1996; Salmivalli, Lappalainen and Lagerspetz, 1998) and of the Aggression and Victimization Scale [Perry, Kusel and Perry, 1988]. This scale, called the New PRS, consisted of 32 items in total. Five highly reliable scales were distinguished with the help of CFA, one for leader‐like bullying behavior, one for follower‐like bullying behavior, and scales for outsider, defender and victim. We computed the roles according to four criteria, that is, z ‐scores (a relative measure) and three different percentage scores (10%, 15% and 20%; each an absolute measure). Sociometric status was also assessed. The concordance between the various methods was moderate. Test–retest stability was also moderate. Test–retest coefficients for the scale scores were considerably higher. Links were found between the roles and sociometric status, irrespective of the method used for assigning roles. Victims were rejected, as were bullies, but defenders were popular. Gender differences indicated that boys were more often bullies or followers, and girls were more often outsiders or defenders. Absolute methods for assigning bullying roles produced fewer unclassifiable children and brought to light substantial differences between classes. Aggr.

In Macaca mulatta, intensity of aggression is high (biting is frequent) and symmetry in aggression is low: the aggressee most often flees or submits. In Macaca tonkeana, in contrast, biting is exceptional, aggression is very often bidirectional, and appeasement behaviors are frequently observed. Intermediate patterns are found in Macaca fascicularis with, in addition, especially frequent mild forms of submission. It is argued that relationships exist between intensity of aggression, symmetry in aggression, and development of behaviors controlling aggresssion. Whether balances between these variables are species-specific is discussed.",

Two samples from Finland (Finnish and Swedish-speaking children), two from Chicago, IL (African Americans and Caucasians), and one from Warsaw, Poland, were included in the study. These types of aggressive behavior and victimization of aggression (physical, verbal, and indirect) were measured using both peer and self estimations. Peer estimations were internally more consistent than self estimations. Children rated themselves as significantly less aggressive than their peers rated them. The opposite was true of victimization. An attributional discrepancy index (ADI) was calculated as the difference between self and peer estimated aggression scores. The index may be seen as an indicator of norms pertaining to aggression in different ethnic groups. ADI scores of girls, but not for boys, showed significant variance over culture on all three types of aggression. This indicates greater cultural variation in norms pertaining to aggression for girls than for boys. Cultural variation and sex differences in the patterning of aggressive behavior were analysed using multidimensional scaling (ALSCAL). Cultural variation appeared as distribution along the x-axis (dimension 1) in a two-dimensional solution, and sex differences along the y-axis (dimension 2), indicating that patterns of aggressive behavior are dependent on both culture and sex. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

These open questions inspired this study with 53.316 5th- and 9th-grade students (5% of the national student population in these grades), from 1,000 schools in Colombia. Students completed a national test of citizenship competencies, which included questions about bullying and about families, neighborhoods and their own socio-emotional competencies. We combined these data with community violence and socio-economic conditions of all Colombian municipalities, which allowed us to conduct multilevel analyses to identify municipality- and school-level variables predicting school bullying. Most variance was found at the school level. Higher levels of school bullying were related to more males in the schools, lower levels of empathy, more authoritarian and violent families, higher levels of community violence, better socio-economic conditions, hostile attributional biases and more beliefs supporting aggression. These results might reflect student, classroom and school contributions because student-level variables were aggregated at the school level. Although in small portions, violence from the decades-old-armed conflict among guerrillas, paramilitaries and governmental forces predicted school bullying at the municipal level for 5th graders. For 9th graders, inequality in land ownership predicted school bullying. Neither poverty, nor population density or homicide rates contributed to explaining bullying. These results may help us advance toward understanding how the larger context relates to school bullying, and what socio-emotional competencies may help us prevent the negative effects of a violent and unequal environment.",

One hypothesis that needs to be examined regarding the causation of this problem is whether being a bully or a victim may stem from disparate underlying patterns of psychopathology. Results are particularly scarce regarding the association between bully‐victim problems and disruptive behavior disorders. The present study sought to investigate the association between DSM‐IV symptoms of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD), and bully‐victim problems in a sample of 202 adolescents, aged 12–15, attending two junior high schools in Cyprus, to determine whether these symptoms differentiate between bullies and victims and provide a new approach to the understanding of bully‐victim problems. Students completed measures of bullying, victimization, disruptive behavior disorder symptoms, and self‐esteem, along with demographic questions. On the basis of their responses, teenagers were classified as bullies, victims, or both bullies and victims. Those who were bully/victims reported greater CD symptomatology. CD and low self‐esteem were predictive of bullying, whereas ODD and low self‐esteem were predictive of victimization. Aggr. Behav. 30:520–533, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Test–retest stability in a subsample of 324 childhood arrestees was good (all ICC's &gt; 0.41). A confirmatory factor analysis supported the same two‐factor structure as in the original RPQ. Convergent validity was adequate (all r 's &gt; 0.16). Moreover, results demonstrated that the proactive and reactive subscales were differentially related to measurements of callousness and impulsiveness, respectively. Criterion validity was shown in that non‐offender subjects demonstrated significantly lower RPQ scores than offender samples. Finally, construct validity was demonstrated in that violent offenders showed higher aggression scores than non‐violent offenders. Proactive aggression showed different developmental trajectories within non‐offender versus criminal samples, indicating that this form of aggression may be more pathological. Aggr.

    "abstract": "In 1996, Tedeschi and Quigley published a review of laboratory aggression research that included many damning criticisms of the genre. This paper revisits Tedeschi and Quigley's critique, and examines the ways that subsequent researchers have addressed the weaknesses they identified. In particular, it examines three new laboratory aggression paradigms (Hot Sauce, Bungled Procedure, and Experimental Graffiti Paradigms) that have attempted to improve upon the “classic” paradigms (Teacher/Learner & Essay Evaluation Paradigms, Competitive Reaction Time Game, Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm, and Bobo Modelling Paradigm). In each case, this review will show, that although some aspects of the new designs are indeed improvements, many of Tedeschi and Quigley's arguments still apply. In conclusion, this investigation will identify a number of factors that future laboratory aggression researchers should consider. These include: The perceptions and motivations of the aggressor; the apparent distance between the aggressor and the target; the availability of non-aggressive response options; the problems of demand characteristics, permissive cues and agentic shift; the differences between proactive and reactive aggression, and the distinction between overt and covert forms of aggression.

To further explore relations between intimate partner violence and Urgency, a measure of autonomic response to pleasant and aversive stimuli and facets of Neuroticism from the NEO PI-R were used as control variables. Autonomic responsivity was correlated with intimate partner violence at the zero-order level, and predicted significant variance in intimate partner violence in regression equations.

In this study, 430 3rd−5th grade children, their peers, and their teachers were surveyed. Children's consumption of media violence early in the school year predicted higher verbally aggressive behavior, higher relationally aggressive behavior, higher physically aggressive behavior, and less prosocial behavior later in the school year. Additionally, these effects were mediated by hostile attribution bias. The findings are interpreted within the theoretical framework of the General Aggression Model. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous research, primarily in North America, has found that individual factors (e.g., ‘internalising problems’) and social factors (e.g., friendship) interact to influence children's levels of peer victimisation. Some research has found that the identity of children's friends and friendship quality (as ‘protective factors’) are more important than the sheer number of friends. However, studies have produced conflicting findings. A peer nomination inventory was used to assess social skills problems, peer victimisation, peer acceptance, and several different aspects of friendship. Four hundred and forty‐nine children aged 9 to 11 years completed the inventory at two time points over the course of an academic year. Social skills problems were found to predict an increase in peer victimisation over time. Two friendship variables were found to moderate this relationship: a) number of friends, and b) the peer acceptance of the very best‐friend. The relationship was found to be weaker for those children with lots of friends and for those children with a ‘popular’ best‐friend. The findings advance understanding of the factors that promote peer victimisation. Aggr. Behav. 32:110–121, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

A sample of 153 incarcerated violent offenders and a community sample of 197 individuals completed self-report measures of self-esteem level, emotion dysregulation, and trait aggression. Offenders reported lower levels of self-esteem than community participants, as well as greater levels of emotional nonacceptance and hostility. Bootstrapping analyses were performed to test whether emotion dysregulation mediated the association between self-esteem level and aggression. In the offender sample, mediation models were significant for three of the four aspects of trait aggression that were considered. Emotion dysregulation fully mediated the links that low self-esteem had with physical aggression, anger, and hostility. The same pattern (with the addition of full mediation for verbal aggression) was confirmed in the community sample. Our findings suggest that emotion dysregulation may play an important role in the connection between low self-esteem and aggression. Alternative models of the associations among these variables were tested and discussed. As a whole, the present results are consistent with those of other studies and suggest that it may be beneficial to include emotion regulation modules as part of prevention and treatment programs for violent offenders.",

Of the 798 high school students who participated in this study, 59 were identified as gang members, 75 as peripheral youth, and 664 as nongang youth. Gang members and peripheral youth were more delinquent than nongang youth overall; however, gang members committed more minor offenses than nongang youth and peripheral youth committed more violent offenses than nongang youth. Gang members were more anti-authority than nongang youth, and both gang and peripheral youth valued social status more than nongang youth. Gang members were also more likely to blame their victims for their actions and use euphemisms to sanitize their behavior than nongang youth, whereas peripheral youth were more likely than nongang youth to displace responsibility onto their superiors.

    "abstract": "Abstract We studied indirect victimization from an evolutionary perspective by examining links between this type of victimization and several indicators of attractiveness (past sexual behavior, dating frequency and physical appearance). Two thousand three hundred and nineteen (56% female) students (ages 13–18) from a region of southern Ontario, Canada, completed self‐report measures of indirect victimization, physical appearance, dating frequency, recent sexual behavior (number of partners in previous month) and past sexual behavior (number of lifetime partners minus number of partners in previous month) as well as indexes of depression, aggression and attachment security, which were used to control for psychosocial maladjustment. Consistent with an evolutionary framework, physical appearance interacted significantly with gender, wherein attractive females were at greater risk for indirect victimization, whereas for males physical attractiveness was a protective factor, reducing risk of victimization. Physical appearance also interacted with grade, being inversely related to indirect victimization for younger adolescents and having a nonsignificant association with victimization for older youth. Finally, recent sexual behavior was associated with increased risk of indirect victimization for older adolescents only, which we discussed with regard to peer perceptions of promiscuity and short‐term mating strategies. These findings have important implications for the development of interventions designed to reduce peer victimization, in that victims of indirect aggression may represent a rather broad, heterogeneous group, including attractive individuals with no obvious signs of maladjustment.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigated the development of relational and physical victimization in adolescent friendship networks over time. Using longitudinal social network analysis (SIENA) it was simultaneously tested whether similarity in victimization contributed to friendship formation (selection effects) and whether victimization of friends contributed to changes in victimization (influence effects). This was done for peer‐reported relational and physical victimization separately in two middle schools (total N = 480; N = 220, 47% girls, in School 1; N = 260, 52% girls, in School 2) across three time points (Grades 6 through 8; M ages 11.5–13.5). Gender, ethnicity, and baseline aggression were controlled as individual predictors of victimization. Similarity in physical victimization predicted friendship formation, whereas physical victimization was not influenced by friends' victimization but rather by adolescents' own physical aggression. Peer influence effects existed for relational victimization, in that adolescents with victimized friends were more likely to increase in victimization over time as well, over and above the effect of adolescents' own relational aggression. These selection and influence effects were not further qualified by gender. The results suggested that both selection and influence processes as well as individual characteristics play a role in the co‐evolution of friendships and victimization, but that these processes are specific for different types of victimization.

Indeed, these subtypes appear to have different developmental trajectories, demographic correlates, and personological underpinnings. They also demonstrate important etiological distinctions. One potential limitation to accumulating additional scientific insights into the correlates and origins of these three types of antisocial behavior is the lack of an efficient self‐report assessment in the public domain. We developed the 32‐item Subtypes of Antisocial Behavior Questionnaire (STAB) to fill this gap. Our goal was to develop a brief measure that could reliably and validly assess each of the three major subtypes of antisocial behavior and that would be freely available for other researchers. The present series of studies provides initial evidence of the factorial validity, internal consistency, and criterion‐related validity of the STAB scales. In short, it appears that the STAB is a brief and useful measure that can be used to differentiate and assess physically aggressive, rule‐breaking, and socially aggressive forms of antisocial behavior.

We specifically tested the hypothesis, based on predictions informed by the confluence model of sexual aggression that pornography will be a risk factor for recidivism only for those individuals classified as relatively high risk for re‐offending. Pornography use (frequency and type) was assessed through self‐report and recidivism was measured using data from a national database from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Indices of recidivism, which were assessed up to 15 years after release, included an overall criminal recidivism index, as well as subcategories focusing on violent (including sexual) recidivism and sexual recidivism alone. Results for both frequency and type of pornography use were generally consistent with our predictions. Most importantly, after controlling for general and specific risk factors for sexual aggression, pornography added significantly to the prediction of recidivism. Statistical interactions indicated that frequency of pornography use was primarily a risk factor for higher‐risk offenders, when compared with lower‐risk offenders, and that content of pornography (i.e., pornography containing deviant content) was a risk factor for all groups. The importance of conceptualizing particular risk factors (e.g., pornography), within the context of other individual characteristics is discussed. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Increasing research is available on the preconditions for child mental health and optimal development in traumatic conditions, whereas less is known how to translate the findings into effective interventions to help traumatized children. This literature review analyses the effectiveness of psychosocial preventive interventions and treatments and their theoretical bases among children traumatized in the context of armed conflicts (war, military violence, terrorism and refugee). The first aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive interventions in preventing emotional distress and impairment and promoting optimal emotional‐cognitive and social development. The second task is to analyze the nature of the underlying mechanisms for the success of preventive interventions, and the theoretical premises of the choice of intervention techniques, procedures and tools. We found 16 relevant published studies, but an examination of them revealed that only four of them had experimental designs strong enough that they could be included in the meta‐analysis. While the subjective reports of the researchers suggested that systematic preventive interventions were effective in decreasing PTSD and depressive symptoms among children traumatized due to armed conflict, the more objective results of the meta‐analysis and the weaknesses in designs uncovered during the meta‐analysis undermine such a conclusion. Additionally, a majority of the reported preventive interventions focused only on children's biased cognitive processes and negative emotions, while only a few aimed at influencing multiple domains of child development and improving developmental functioning on emotional, social and psychophysiological levels. It is concluded that substantial additional work needs to be done in developing effective preventive interventions and treatments for children traumatized by exposure to war and violence. Aggr.

Additionally, an analysis of the relations of these mechanisms to pro‐bullying behavior was conducted. Multilevel analysis showed a significant relationship between cognitive restructuring and individual pro‐bullying behavior. Moreover, between‐class variability of pro‐bullying behavior was positively related to minimizing one's agentive role and blaming/dehumanizing the victim at the class level. Conversely, class disregarding/distorting the consequences was negatively associated with between‐class variation in the outcome behavior.

Two hundred and twenty-one young adult prisoners (mean age=21.0, range 18-25 years) received nutritional supplements containing vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids or placebos, over a period of 1-3 months. As in the earlier (British) study, reported incidents were significantly reduced (P=.017, one-tailed) in the active condition (n=115), as compared with placebo (n=106). Other assessments, however, revealed no significant reductions in aggressiveness or psychiatric symptoms. As the incidents reported concerned aggressive and rule-breaking behavior as observed by the prison staff, the results are considered to be promising. However, as no significant improvements were found in a number of other (self-reported) outcome measures, the results should be interpreted with caution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We examined the relationship between being bullied during childhood and activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis as assessed through repeated measures of salivary cortisol. A non‐clinical sample of 154 (74 boys) predominantly Caucasian middle‐class 12‐year‐olds each provided detailed information about their experiences with bullying and six saliva samples were standardized across time and day. Children with a history of child maltreatment, diagnosed psychiatric illness, foster care placement, medication use (psychotropic and oral contraception) and aggression directed toward peers and/or family members were excluded. Using multilevel regression and applying orthogonal polynomial contrasts to model the observed circadian pattern in the data, we found that occasional and frequent verbal peer victimization was associated with hyposecretion of cortisol when controlling for sex, pubertal status, age, depression and anxiety. This relation, however, was moderated by sex. For boys, occasional exposure was associated with higher cortisol levels, whereas for girls exposure was associated with lower cortisol levels. The present study highlights the need to consider the plight of peer‐victimized children seriously, as it is associated with alterations to the HPA axis that affect males and females differently, and likely diminishes a person's ability to cope with stress, possibly placing them at risk for psychopathology and ill health.

Social status was tested as a moderator of the associations between moral cognition and bullying and defending. Participants completed self‐reports assessing the two dimensions of moral cognition and peer nominations for status, bullying, and defending. Both acceptance of moral transgression and moral disengagement were associated to bullying among early adolescents only, whereas in childhood moral disengagement was linked to defending among girls. Social status moderated the associations between morality dimensions and bullying and defending. The moderating effects of status were discussed considering status as a magnifying lens for the relations between individual characteristics and social behavior.

The proportion of offenders incarcerated for violent offenses is large, and the cost of keeping these offenders incarcerated is startling. Understanding and treating the causal underpinnings of violent crime is of utmost importance for individuals and society as a whole. Several factors have been identified as potential contributors to violent crime, including cognitive deficits in executive functioning [Hoaken et al., 2007]. To investigate this further, 77 offenders from Fenbrook Institution, a federal facility, were tested on a battery of executive functioning measures. Offenders were found to have broad and pervasive dysfunction in their executive abilities. In addition, specific scores from the battery were found using regression techniques, to predict the frequency and severity of past violent offending but not nonviolent offending. This speaks of the possibility of a new type of correctional rehabilitation program, one that focuses on the rehabilitation of basic executive functions.",

A student sample (N = 1,104) reported on their use of physical aggression and controlling behavior, to partners and to same-sex non-intimates. Contrary to the male control theory, women were found to be more physically aggressive to their partners than men were, and the reverse pattern was found for aggression to same-sex non-intimates. Furthermore, there were no substantial sex differences in controlling behavior, which significantly predicted physical aggression in both sexes. IPV was found to be associated with physical aggression to same-sex non-intimates, thereby demonstrating a link with aggression outside the family. Using Johnson's typology, women were more likely than men to be classed as \"intimate terrorists,\" which was counter to earlier findings. Overall, these results do not support the male control theory of IPV. Instead, they fit the view that IPV does not have a special etiology, and is better studied within the context of other forms of aggression.",

Contrary to our expectations, no systematic age influence emerged. Regarding the relations of children's emotion comprehension with both empathy measures and their prosocial/hostile attitudes, we have found: (1) a low significant relation with the total empathy measure, according to all the teachers, but with the cognitive empathy only according to teachers B; (2) a robust negative relationship of both affective and cognitive empathy with Hostile roles and with Outsider role, contrary to a positive correlation of only affective empathy with Prosocial roles.

This pattern clearly suggests that the behaviors measured in the reflexive fighting task reflect conspecific defensive reactions, rather than \"shockelicited aggression.\" Moreover, striking responses seen in the reflexive fighting task also occur at a high rate when footshock is given to a solitary rat held in a boxing posture.

The classroom‐based German preventive intervention “Medienhelden” (engl.: “Media Heroes”) builds on previous knowledge about links between cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and cyberbullying, among others. For an evaluation study, longitudinal data were available from 722 high school students aged 11–17 years ( M = 13.36, SD = 1.00, 51.8% female) before and six months after the implementation of the program. A 10‐week version and a 1‐day version were conducted and compared with a control group (controlled pre‐long‐term‐follow‐up study). Schools were asked to randomly assign their participating classes to the intervention conditions. Multi‐group structural equation modeling (SEM) showed a significant effect of the short intervention on cognitive empathy and significant effects of the long intervention on affective empathy and cyberbullying reduction. The results suggest the long‐term intervention to be more effective in reducing cyberbullying and promoting affective empathy. Without any intervention, cyberbullying increased and affective empathy decreased across the study period. Empathy change was not generally directly linked to change in cyberbullying behavior. “Media Heroes” provides effective teaching materials and empowers schools to address the important topic of cyberbullying in classroom settings without costly support from the outside.

As predicted by the social identity model of deindividuation effects, undesirable behavior is not uncommon in online gaming environments, and online harassment has become a pervasive issue in the gaming community. In this study, we sought to determine what personality traits and game-related variables predicted two types of online aggression in video games: general harassment (e.g., skill-based taunting, insulting others' intelligence) and sexual harassment (e.g., sexist comments, rape threats). Men who play online video games (N = 425) participated in an anonymous online survey. Social dominance orientation and hostile sexism predicted higher levels of both sexual harassment and general harassment in online games. Game involvement and hours of weekly gameplay were additional predictors of general harassment. We discuss implications of online social aggression and online sexual harassment for online gaming. We also apply our findings to the broader understanding of online harassment, cyberaggression, cyberbullying, and other forms of online hostility in computer-mediated communication contexts. Aggr.

Participants were asked about both victimization by, and perpetration of, sexual aggression since the age of 14. Both same‐sex and heterosexual victim–perpetrator constellations were examined. Prevalence rates were established for different victim–perpetrator relationships (partners, acquaintances, strangers) and for incidents involving alcohol consumption by one or both partners. The overall perpetration rate was 13.2%, for men and 7.6% for women. The overall victimization rate was 35.9% for women and 19.4% for men. A disparity between victimization and perpetration reports was found for both men and women. Perpetration and victimization rates were highest among participants who had sexual contacts with both opposite‐sex and same‐sex partners. Sexual aggression and victimization rates were higher between current or former partners and acquaintances than between strangers. Alcohol consumption by one or both partners was involved in almost 75% of all victimization and almost 70% of all perpetration incidents. The findings portray a comprehensive picture of the scale of sexual aggression and victimization in college students with different sexual lifestyles. Aggr.

Using latent growth modeling, analyses were carried out to investigate how participants responded to the different scenes across time. The findings of this study suggested that repeated exposure to media violence reduces the psychological impact of media violence in the short term, therefore desensitizing viewers to media violence. As a result, viewers tended to feel less sympathetic toward the victims of violence and actually enjoy more the violence portrayed in the media. Additionally, desensitization to media violence was better represented by a curvilinear pattern, whereas desensitization to comedy scenes was better represented by a linear pattern. Finally, trait aggression was not related to the pattern of change over time, although significant effects were found for initial reports of enjoyment and sympathy.",

Second, we examined the behavioral and status characteristics associated with the participant roles in middle adolescence. Third, we compared two sets of criteria for assigning students to the participant roles of bullying. Participants were 1,638 adolescents (50.9% boys, M age = 16.38 years, SD =.80) who completed the shortened participant role questionnaire and peer nominations for peer status and behavioral characteristics. Adolescents were assigned to the participant roles according to the relative criteria of Salmivalli, Lagerspetz, Björkqvist, Österman, and Kaukiainen (1996). Next, the students in each role were divided in two subgroups based on an additional absolute criterion: the Relative Only Criterion subgroup (nominated by less than 10% of their classmates) and the Absolute &amp; Relative Criterion subgroup (nominated by at least 10% of their classmates). Adolescents who bullied or reinforced or assisted bullies were highly popular and disliked and scored high on peer‐valued characteristics. Adolescents who were victimized held the weakest social position in the peer group. Adolescents who defended victims were liked and prosocial, but average in popularity and peer‐valued characteristics. Outsiders held a socially weak position in the peer group, but were less disliked, less aggressive, and more prosocial than victims. The behavior and status profiles of adolescents in the participant roles were more extreme for the Absolute &amp; Relative Criterion subgroup than for the Relative Only Criterion subgroup. Aggr.

However, few studies have examined cross‐cultural variation in sex differences, particularly among low‐ and middle‐income countries [LMICs]. Based on social role and sexual selection theories, we derived two hypotheses regarding possible variations in sex differences across societal contexts: 1) sex differences increase with societal gender polarization (social role theory) and 2) sex differences are exacerbated in societies where socio‐economic opportunities are scarce, unequal, or insecure (prediction derived from sexual selection theory). The current study examined the prevalence of and variation in sex differences in physical aggression, as measured by frequent fighting, among 247,909 adolescents in 63 low‐ and middle‐income countries. The results show that, overall, males were over twice as likely (OR = 2.68; 95% CI = 2.60–2.76) to report frequent fighting in the past 12 months than females. However, sex differences vary significantly across LMICs, wherein countries with higher female prevalence rates have smaller sex differences in frequent fighting. Contrary to expectations derived from social role theory, sex differences in physical aggression decrease as societal gender inequality increased. In regards to sexual selection theory, we find no evidence that sex differences in frequent fighting varies according to societal rule of law or income inequality.",

Methodological moderating effects (measure type, definition of bullying, publication type and year, age, and country) were examined in both analyses. Using Cohen's d , results indicated a null effect size for the ethnic majority–minority group comparison. Moderator analyses indicated that ethnic majority youth experienced more peer victimization than ethnic minorities in the US ( d = .23). The analysis on multiple group comparisons between White and Black ( d = .02), Hispanic ( d = .08), Asian ( d = .05), Aboriginal ( d = −.02) and Biracial ( d = −.05) groups indicated small effect sizes. Overall, results from the main and moderator analyses yielded small effects of ethnicity, suggesting that ethnicity assessed as a demographic variable is not an adequate indicator for addressing ethnic group differences in peer victimization. Although few notable differences were found between White and non‐White groups regarding rates of peer victimization, certain societal and methodological limitations in the assessment of peer victimization may underestimate differences between ethnicities.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aggression pervades modern life. To understand the root causes of aggression, researchers have developed several methods to assess aggressive inclinations. The current article introduces a new behavioral method—the voodoo doll task (VDT)—that offers a reliable and valid trait and state measure of aggressive inclinations across settings and relationship contexts. Drawing on theory and research on the law of similarity and magical beliefs (Rozin, Millman, &amp; Nemeroff [1986], Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , 50, 703−712), we propose that people transfer characteristics of a person onto a voodoo doll representing that person. As a result, causing harm to a voodoo doll by stabbing it with pins may have important psychological similarities to causing actual harm to the person the voodoo doll represents. Nine methodologically diverse studies (total N = 1,376) showed that the VDT had strong reliability, construct validity, and convergent validity. Discussion centers on the importance of magical beliefs in understanding the causes of aggressive inclinations. Aggr. Behav. 39:419–439, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Although the importance of peer bystanders in bullying has been recognized, there are few studies that examine the phenomenon in relation to Latané and Darley's (1970) classic Bystander Intervention Model, which states that there are five stages of bystander intervention: (i) notice the event; (ii) interpret the event as an emergency that requires assistance; (iii) accept responsibility for intervening; (iv) know how to intervene or provide help; and (v) implement intervention decisions. This study examined preliminary evidence of reliability and validity of the Bystander Intervention Model in Bullying (Nickerson, Aloe, Livingston, &amp; Feeley, 2014), and the extent to which bullying role behavior (bullying, assisting, victimization, defending, and outsider behavior) and gender predicted each step of the model with a sample of 299 middle school students. Results of a Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported a five‐factor structure of the measure corresponding to the steps of the model. There was evidence of convergent validity and Cronbach alpha for each subscale exceeded .75. In addition, students who reported defending their peers were more likely to also engage in all five steps of the bystander intervention model, while victims were more likely to notice events, and outsiders were less likely to intervene. Gender differences and gender interactions were also found. Aggr. Behav. 43:281–290, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Normative beliefs regarding cyber aggression was positively related to both forms of cyber aggression 6 months later, after controlling for normative beliefs about face-to-face aggression. Furthermore, a significant two-way interaction between Time 1 cyber relational aggression and normative beliefs about cyber relational aggression was found. Follow-up analysis showed that Time 1 cyber relational aggression was more strongly related to Time 2 cyber relational aggression when young adults held higher normative beliefs about cyber relational aggression.

A total of 334 adolescents (173 boys, 160 girls) between the ages of 12 and 16 years ( M = 13.6, SD = 1.3), recruited from community youth organizations, completed self‐report measures of physical and relational bullying and victimization, as well as dating and sexual behavior. As predicted, pure physical bullying was positively associated with the number of dating and sexual partners, primarily for adolescent boys. Adolescent girls with more dating partners had greater odds of being relational bully‐victims, in line with predictions. Finally, adolescent girls with more sexual partners were at greater risk of being physically victimized by peers, and greater involvement with dating and sexual partners was associated with higher odds of being a physical bully‐victim. Results are discussed with respect to evolutionary theory and research in which adolescent boys may display strength and athleticism through physical bullying to facilitate intersexual selection, whereas relational bullying may be employed as a strategy to engage in intrasexual competition with rivals for mates.

    "abstract": "Abstract Although researchers have developed prevention programs to reduce bullying, the results are mixed, and this may be due to a degree of uncertainty in their theoretical foundation. In particular, these programs share an emphasis on empathy as a personal attribute that can be enhanced among students through the application of specific curricula that will, in turn, contribute to a reduction in bullying behavior. However, the link between empathy and bullying is unclear, as is the ability of bullying prevention programs to actually impact student empathy. In this study, we used a cluster randomized trial ( N = 15 middle schools, 1,890 students, 47.1% female, 75.2% White) to evaluate the impact of cooperative learning on bullying, and we evaluated whether these effects were mediated by empathy and peer relatedness. Our results indicated that cooperative learning can significantly reduce bullying, and that some of this effect is transmitted via enhancements to affective empathy. Cooperative learning also demonstrated significant positive effects on cognitive empathy, but this did not have an effect on bullying. We also found that the effects of cooperative learning on cognitive and affective empathy were mediated by improvements in peer relatedness. These findings add a degree of clarity to the literature, and also represent the first time, as far as we are aware, that an antibullying program has been found to have significant effects on both cognitive and affective empathy.",

The aims of this study were to use a peer‐report measure to assess these roles and to investigate their associations with social competence among pre‐schoolers. We also explored whether status among peers, indicated by being socially preferred, mediates the relationship between social competence and bullying roles. Three hundred twenty 3‐ to 6‐year‐old children participated in the study. Bullying roles and social preference were assessed by means of peer reports, whereas social competence was investigated with a Q‐Sort methodology, based on observations in classrooms. Bullying was also assessed by means of teacher reports. The results showed quite a clear distinction among roles and a correspondence between peer and teacher assessments, except for the role of outsider. The role of defender was positively associated with social competence, whereas the other roles were negatively associated. In a subsample, social preference statistically predicted the role of bully and mediated between social competence and bullying. The findings are discussed in terms of the importance of assessing bullying and its correlates at a very young age, although roles may further develop when children grow up. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Although low resting heart rate has been viewed as a well‐replicated biological correlate of child and adolescent antisocial behavior, little is known about how it interacts with psychosocial adversity in predisposing to both reactive–proactive aggression and psychopathy, and whether this relationship generalizes to an East Asian population. This study tests the hypothesis that low resting heart rate will be associated with aggression and psychopathic traits, and that heart rate will interact with adversity in predisposing to these antisocial traits. Resting heart rate was assessed in 334 Hong Kong male and female schoolchildren aged 11–17 years. A social adversity index was calculated from a psychosocial interview of the parent, while parents assessed their children on the Reactive–Proactive Aggression Questionnaire and the Antisocial Personality Screening Device. Low resting heart rate was significantly associated with higher proactive aggression, impulsive features of psychopathy, and total child psychopathy. Low resting heart rate interacted with high psychosocial adversity in explaining higher reactive (but not proactive) aggression, as well as impulsive psychopathy. These findings provide support for a biosocial perspective of reactive aggression and impulsive psychopathy, and document low resting heart rate as a robust correlate of both childhood impulsive psychopathic behavior and proactive aggression. To our knowledge, this study is the first to document low resting heart rate as a correlate of child psychopathy and the second to establish low heart rate as a risk factor of antisocial behavior in an East Asian population. The findings provide further evidence for both low resting heart rate as a potential biomarker for childhood psychopathic and aggressive behavior, and also a biosocial perspective on childhood antisocial behavior.

Effectiveness (e.g., the change between waves 2 and 1) was examined in 2,042 students (47.6% girls), aged 11.7 years (SD = 0.88) enrolled in 18 schools and 103 classes. Sustainability (e.g., the change between waves 3 and 2) was examined in a sub-sample of 6 schools and 35 classes comprising 659 students. The self-assessment multiple-item scales showed longitudinal and multiple group invariance. Factor scores were extracted to compute difference scores for effectiveness (Posttest minus Pretest) and sustainability (Follow-up test minus Posttest) for cyberbullying and cyber-victimization. Multilevel Modeling was applied to examine (i) the effectiveness and (ii) the sustainability of the ViSC intervention controlling for several individual and class level variables. Controlling for covariates, it was demonstrated that the ViSC program is effective in preventing cyberbullying and cyber-victimization and that the effects are sustainable after 6 months.

The program's impacts were separately determined for the different roles within cyberbullying that students can take, i.e., cyber-victims, cyber-bullies, cyber-bully/victims, and bystanders. The ConRed program is a theory-driven program designed to prevent cyberbullying and improve cyberbullying coping skills. It involves students, teachers, and families. During a 3-month period, external experts conducted eight training sessions with students, two with teachers and one with families. ConRed was evaluated through a quasi-experimental design, in which students from three secondary schools were separated into experimental and control groups. The sample comprised 875 students, aged between 11 and 19 years. More students (n = 586) were allocated to the experimental groups at the specific insistence of the management of all schools; the remainder (n = 289) formed the control. Repeated measures MANOVA showed that cyber victims, cyber aggressors and cyberbully/victims reduced their involvement in cyberbullying. Moreover, cyber-victims and bystanders adjusted their perceptions about their control of personal information on the Internet, and cyber aggressors and bystanders reduced their Internet dependence. The ConRed program had stronger effects on male participants, especially in heightening their affective empathy.",

One way to explore this issue is to analyze whether programs designed to prevent traditional bullying help prevent cyberbullying, and whether programs designed to prevent cyberbullying prevent traditional bullying. The main goal of the current study was to analyze the spillover effects of the cyberbullying prevention program Media Heroes (Medienhelden) on traditional bullying. Media Heroes promotes empathy, knowledge of risks and consequences, and strategies that allow bystanders to defend victims from cyberbullying. Mixed ANOVAs were conducted comparing pretest and post-test (6 months after intervention) measures of 722 students (ages 11-17) assigned to a long (15 sessions) intervention, a short (1 day) intervention, and a control group. In addition to confirming the previously reported effects on cyberbullying, Media Heroes was found to reduce traditional bullying. Effects were larger for the long-version of the program than for the short 1-day version. No effects were found on victimization by either cyberbullying or traditional bullying.

To extend this literature, the current study examined new predictors and outcomes of cyberbullying perpetration (CP) and victimization (CV) among college students from two different universities that were followed across two time points. Risk factors were measured in line with previous theoretical models, including biological or personality‐related variables (e.g., low self‐control, dark‐side personality traits, empathy) and environmental variables (e.g., perceived social support, lack of rule clarity, and internet use). Additionally, we examined several possible outcomes of CV and CP. Results from path analyses revealed that involvement with traditional bullying (either as a perpetrator or a victim) as well as Machiavellianism significantly predicted CV and CP. With regard to the cross‐lagged associations between CV and CP, we found that Time 1 CV predicted time 2 CP, but Time 1 CP did not predict Time 2 CV. That is, being a victim of cyberbullying during the Fall semester predicted involvement as a perpetrator in the Spring semester. However, being a perpetrator during the Fall semester did not predict being a victim during the Spring semester. Regarding outcomes, we found that CV significantly predicted anxiety, depression, and helping behavior, and CP significantly predicted deviant behavior, but not GPA nor alcohol consumption. These findings have practical implications for college students as well as university student support services.",

The objective of this study was to test the four key interrelated pillars of the Confluence Model. The first key pillar posits the interaction of Hostile Masculinity and Impersonal Sex as core risk predictors. The second pillar entails a “mediated structure” wherein the impact of more general risk factors is mediated via those specific to aggression against women. The third pillar comprises a single latent factor underlying various types of sexual violence. The fourth pillar expands the core model by including the secondary risk factors of lower empathy, peer support, extreme pornography use, and participation in alcohol parties. An ethnically diverse sample of 1,148 male students from 13 U.S. colleges and universities completed a comprehensive survey that assessed the hypothesized risk factors and self‐reported sexual violence, which included noncontact sexual offenses, contact sexual coercion, and contact sexual aggression. A series of multiple regression analyses were conducted before testing structural equation models. The results supported the integration of the four pillars within a single expanded empirical model that accounted for 49% of the variance of sexual violence. This study yielded data supporting all four key pillars. These findings provide information about non‐redudant risk factors that can be used to develop screening tools, group‐based and individually tailored psychoeducational and treatment interventions.",

However, it is not clear how much of this decline is due to a real change in behaviour, and how much to children’s changing definitions of what bullying is. This paper presents the results of two retrospective studies in an attempt to assess at what ages bullying is really most likely to occur. Male and female adults aged 18–55 years (n 1 = 205 and n 2 = 200) completed questionnaires about their memories of being bullied at school. Results showed that bullying was most frequently remembered from around 11–13 years of age, with incidents from earlier and later childhood being reported comparatively rarely. There were no differences between the reports of younger (18–21 years) and older (22–55 years) participants or between those of males and females. Bullying memories were also compared with memories for other aspects of childhood to assess the accuracy of these memories. It is concluded that the most memorable (and therefore perhaps the most severe) bullying is that which occurs in middle childhood. Aggr. Behav. 27:419–429, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The groups were compared at ages 8, 14, and 27 in variables representing the constructs of a two-dimensional model of emotional and behavioral regulation. The REA Ss were characterized by higher self-control, especially constructiveness, at each age and better adult adjustment than the PROA Ss. The PROA males were prone to externalizing problems and criminality in adulthood, whereas the PROA females were prone to internalizing problems and neuroticism in adulthood. Both exhibited conduct problems in adolescence, and became heavy users of alcohol in adulthood. The PROA Ss had more children at age 27 than the other Ss. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Results were that brief exposure to a violent video game increased aggressive behavior. Mediational analyses suggested that the violent video game effect on aggression was not mediated by instrumental aggressive motivation, but was partially mediated by revenge motivation. Other results suggested that the violent video game effect on aggression might be greater when the game player controls a same‐sex violent game character. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract This meta‐analysis investigated the possibility that gender differences in aggression, and the variability in these differences, are a function of gender differences in the regulation of arousal generated in emotionally evocative contexts. The sample of studies for this analysis was based on an exhaustive search of the relevant research reports from 1965–1999. Studies were excluded from the sample if they were case studies; investigated spousal/familial or societal violence, war, suicide, or political violence; involved clinical or deviant participants; included fewer than 10 participants; included all male, all female, all non‐Caucasian, or non‐US/non‐Canadian participants. Based on previous evidence that males may be more easily aroused by aggressive‐relevant emotional stimuli than females, and that males may have more difficulty regulating emotionally arousing states than females, we hypothesized that the magnitude of the gender differences in aggression would covary, in a nonlinear manner, with the emotional evocativeness of the study context. Consistent with our hypothesis, the magnitude of gender differences in aggression was relatively small in research contexts that appeared to produce no or large increments in emotional arousal and larger (favoring males) in contexts that appeared to produce small or medium increments in emotional arousal.

Specifically, we examined the relations between the facets (subordinate traits) from three domains (superordinate dimensions): Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, of the Five Factor Model and five outcome variables: stability of conduct problems, variety of conduct problems, onset of conduct problems, aggression, and antisocial personality disorder symptoms. These relations were examined in a community sample of 481 individuals. These three personality dimensions were chosen for exploration due to their consistent relations, at the domain level, with antisocial behaviors. The results from this study suggest that the facets from the dimension of Agreeableness are the most consistently related to all five outcomes. However, the facets from all three domains made significant contributions. Overall, three personality traits stood out as being the strongest and most consistent predictors: low straightforwardness, low compliance, and low deliberation.

    "abstract": "Using a survey instrument, the experiences of psychiatric nurses with inpatient aggression were investigated in East London, U.K. On this \"Perceptions of Prevalence Of Aggression Scale\" (POPAS), annual experiences with 15 types of disruptive and aggressive behavior were rated anonymously. Staff members were also asked to disclose the number of days missed from work due to inpatient violence. On the basis of these POPAS forms, internal consistency of the instrument, mean reported aggression frequencies, and days missed from work due to violence were calculated. Internal consistency of the POPAS appeared to be reasonable. Verbal abuse and threats were experienced by most of the psychiatric nurses during a one-year period (i.e., by about 80–90 percent of nurses). Sexual harassment or intimidation was also experienced relatively often on an annual basis (68 percent), particularly by female and young staff members. A minority of staff members (i.e., 16 percent) had experienced severe physical violence. Although not prevalent, this type of behavior was most strongly connected with reporting sick. In particular, staff members working with involuntarily admitted patients experienced much (severe) violence during their work. Although the validity of estimates of aggression prevalence with the POPAS instrument needs to be investigated further, such a survey may be helpful in gaining insight rather quickly into the level of day-to-day contact with aggressive behavior. Also, since information on verbal, physical, and sexual violence, and on days missed from work, can be provided anonymously, this rather delicate, but essential management information, may be accessed relatively easily with the POPAS.

As such, the purpose of this article is to review both the animal and human literature pertaining to prefrontal cortical functioning and aggression in an attempt to help clarify this relationship. Particular attention is paid to differentiating the functions of the dorsolateral and the orbital regions of the prefrontal cortex in the expression of aggression. Evidence was garnered from four different types of studies: 1) those examining aggressive behavior in animals following ablations to the prefrontal cortex; 2) those examining aggressive behavior in humans following surgical and accidental lesions to the prefrontal cortex; 3) those examining prefrontal cortical functioning in individuals with psychiatric disorders characterized by aggression; and 4) those relating prefrontal cortical functioning to human aggressive behavior in laboratory situations. The general conclusion of this article is that the dorsolateral region of the prefrontal cortex is more likely to be involved in the expression of physical aggression whereas the orbital region is more likely to be involved in the expression of what is termed herein “disinhibited-nonaggressive” behavior. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In a second study, groups of male and female homosexuals and heterosexuals completed this Aggression Inventory after having blood samples taken to assay resting levels of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E). Groups of subjects within each gender were closely matched in terms of age, education, and vocational interests. Women were matched for the same time in their menstrual cycle (early follicular phase). Among men, homosexuals were indistinguishable from heterosexuals on all measures of aggression. Lesbians did not differ from heterosexual women on any aggression subscale except physical aggression, in which the homosexual women had lower scores.

The second study involved the development, piloting, and validation of a vignette‐based assessment of aggressive behavior, the Aggressive Provocation Questionnaire. The third concerned the use of the finalised Aggressive Provocation Questionnaire in a sample of 130 men (aged 17 to 54 years). The results show that prior self‐reported aggression (measured by the AQ) predicted responses to provoking scenarios. Younger men (&lt; 28 years) showed an association between physical aggression and the aggressive action scale (of the Aggressive Provocation Questionnaire) in response to provoking scenarios. Older men (&gt; 28 years) showed an association between physical aggression and the assertive action scale.

    "abstract": "Abstract Bullying is a considerable problem in schools. It has various negative effects on the children involved. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how children themselves interpret and construct bullying. Three elementary school classes with a high number of victim nominations were chosen among the 48 classes taking part in a larger study. The pupils from selected classes were interviewed in small groups. The interviews were tape‐recorded, transcribed and analyzed using the discourse analytical methodology described by Potter and Wetherell [1987]. Various recurrently used systems of terms (e.g., interpretative repertoires) were found. The results suggest that bullying can be construed as unproblematic and justified among children. For example, the ‘interpretative repertoire of underestimation’ constructs bullying as a game or some other harmless action, the ‘odd student repertoire’ describes the victim as a negatively deviant student who cannot behave as he/she should and the ‘interpretative repertoire of deserving’ constructs meaningful reasons for hostility towards the victim. These and other interpretative repertoires are described and discussed. Aggr. Behav. 29:134–154. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Play-fighting appears to involve the behavior patterns of attack and defense otherwise seen in serious fighting. The degree of similarity, however, depends on the body targets attacked and defended during these forms of fighting. For many taxa, including diverse mammalian families and some birds, the same targets are attacked and defended during both play-fighting and serious fighting. However, for several species of muroid rodents, the targets of play-fighting are not the same as those of serious fighting. In these cases, the tactics of attack and defense are also different. It is argued that for these muroid species the playful targets have arisen from amicable behavior (e.g., social investigation, greeting, allogrooming) rather than, as appears to be the case in so many other taxa, from agonistic behavior. These data strongly suggest that “play-fighting” has evolved from different precursors in different taxa and thus has multiple origins. Furthermore, these data have an important bearing on the universal applicability of many of the suggested functions of play-fighting and also on how such behavior is to be described and classified.",

However, most empirical studies have investigated social–cognitive correlates of stable child and adolescent aggressiveness, and less is known about real‐time decision making to engage in aggressive behavior. A model of real‐time decision making must incorporate both impulsive actions and rational thought. The present paper advances a process model ( response evaluation and decision ; RED) of real‐time behavioral judgments and decision making in aggressive youths with mathematic representations that may be used to quantify response strength. These components are a heuristic to describe decision making, though it is doubtful that individuals always mentally complete these steps. RED represents an organization of social–cognitive operations believed to be active during the response decision step of social information processing. The model posits that RED processes can be circumvented through impulsive responding.

These predictions were influenced by theories that emphasise the role of threats to high self-esteem in the production of aggression and violence. Results indicate that groups defined by their extreme scores on self-esteem and narcissism scales produced levels of anger expression in the predicted direction.

In addition to examining the occurrence of different types of aggression in these workplaces, the question of whether being a target of aggression is related to employees’ subjective well‐being was addressed. One hundred sixty‐nine participants (mainly 30–50 years of age) employed in a wide range of organizations in the public sector completed a questionnaire measuring four types of observed and experienced aggression: direct overt, indirect manipulative, covert insinuative, and rational‐appearing aggression. Indirect manipulative and rational‐appearing aggression were perceived to be the most widely used aggression styles in the work context. In the predominantly male workplaces, the men were perceived to use more of all types of aggression than in the predominantly female workplaces. The women’s aggression was not related to the relative number of females and males with whom they worked. Participants were divided into two groups on the basis of the extent to which they estimated themselves to be targets of workplace aggression. Those who considered themselves to be victims of workplace aggression suffered significantly more from psychosocial problems and physical symptoms than those who had been victimized to a lesser extent or not at all. The victimized group also considered the aggression they had suffered to be the reason for their psychosocial and health problems. Aggr. Behav. 27:360–371, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigated the 6‐year stability and predictive validity of adolescent psychopathy features during the transition to young adulthood. It represents one of the longest outcome studies of youth psychopathy to date, and therefore addresses a primary criticism of the research area (i.e., lack of demonstrated associations between child and adult psychopathy features). Recruited participants were 475 males enrolled in the Minnesota Twin and Family Study who had completed a research‐based measure of psychopathy features consisting of separate emotional detachment (or affective) and antisocial tendencies (or behavioral) subscales. These psychopathy features and various externalizing symptoms (i.e., conduct problems, impulsivity, and substance use disorder) were assessed through rating scales and structured diagnostic interview at an intake assessment (ages 16–18) and 6‐year follow‐up. Consistent with prediction, adolescent psychopathy features displayed moderate stability across the transition from adolescence to adulthood [intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) = 0.40–0.41]. The antisocial tendencies subscale was uniquely related to most externalizing symptoms both in adolescence and in adulthood, whereas the emotional detachment subscale showed appropriate discriminant validity in its lack of association with externalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that psychopathy features are relatively stable from adolescence to adulthood and provide possible insights into the development and maintenance of externalizing difficulties during the adult transition.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study, which involved two waves of measurement over a period of 12 months, examined first whether the positive association between relational aggression and two types of high status was moderated by social self‐efficacy, leadership, cooperation, and peer sociability. It was expected that relational aggressors are most likely to gain high peer group status when they are also self‐efficacious or prosocial. Second, this study examined the reciprocal association between relational aggression and high peer status. It was anticipated that relational aggression would contribute to higher perceived popularity and vice versa. Third, we also examined and hypothesized reciprocal effects between social self‐efficacy, leadership, cooperation, and peer sociability and perceived popularity. Youth were 540 13–15 year olds participating in Grade 7 (Time 1) and again 1 year later in Grade 8 (Time 2). Data were collected from peers, teachers, and the adolescents themselves. Consistent with expectations, relationally aggressive adolescents high in social self‐efficacy, leadership, cooperation, and peer sociability were higher in status than relationally aggressive individuals with low levels of these characteristics. In addition, relational aggression and perceived popularity reciprocally influenced each other. Finally, social self‐efficacy, leadership, cooperation, and peer sociability reciprocally influenced and were influenced by perceived popularity. Aggr.

Predictors of sexual assault perpetration that have been documented in past research differentiated nonperpetrators from both types of perpetrators. Perpetrators of sexual assaults that involved alcohol were in most ways similar to perpetrators of sexual assaults that did not, although they did differ on impulsivity, alcohol consumption in sexual situations, and beliefs about alcohol.

As an alternative to relying on reports of criminal behavior, a method that may overestimate the role that peers play in criminal behavior, the current research on co‐offending uses court records to identify and track over time individuals who are known to commit crimes together. The present investigation is the first co‐offending study to track patterns of violent criminal behavior (over an 18‐year period) among a sample of urban offenders and their accomplices. The study tests whether violence “spreads” from violent offenders to those inexperienced in violence. Results indicate that nonviolent offenders who commit their first co‐offense with violent accomplices are at increased risk for subsequent serious violent crime. Findings suggest that lessons of violence can be learned “on the street,” where knowledge is passed along through impromptu social contexts, including those in which offenders commit crimes together.

    "abstract": "Abstract A large body of research has documented a relation between the executive cognitive functions (ECFs) and interpersonal aggressive behavior. A predominant theory proposes that individuals with poor ECFs are more aggressive because they are unable to inhibit impulsive behaviors. However, evidence for this relationship is typically indirect. In this study, 46 healthy men and women completed measures of ECF, the Taylor Aggression Paradigm, and the Go/No‐Go discrimination task, a behavioral measure of impulsivity. Also, impulsiveness of participant responses during the aggression task was directly assessed by measuring latency of responses to provocation (“set‐time”). It was hypothesized that low‐quartile–scoring ECF men and women would perform more aggressively and more impulsively than high‐quartile peers. Consistent with expectations, results indicated that ECF was related to aggression and to impulsivity on the Go/No‐Go task. However, low‐ECF men and women did not have shorter set‐times; in fact, on this task, low‐ECF participants' behavioral decisions seemed slightly slower than those of high‐ECF participants. In light of these results, the authors speculate that a social information‐processing problem may mediate the ECF aggression relationship rather than altered impulsivity per se. Aggr.

A peer nomination measure of bullying and victimization was administered twice over an interval of one year. The sample consisted of 236 (126 girls and 110 boys) children at the beginning of the study (T1) and 242 children one year later (T2) (mean age: 8 years). To test how children responded when provoked, both spontaneously and after prompting, we used provocation scenarios, and to test their attributional interpretations we used ambiguous scenarios. The results showed that children not involved in bullying responded in an assertive way to provocation more often than bullies and victims, but not more than bully/victims. In general, aggressive answers diminished after prompting and irrelevant answers increased. Appealing for the help of an adult or a peer was the strategy most often chosen. When the intent of the perpetrator was ambiguous, bully/victims attributed more blame, were angrier, and would retaliate more than those not involved. Partly similar results were obtained when stably involved children were compared with those unstably involved. Suggestions for intervention are presented. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study evaluates the effect of an intervention program on the reduction of bullying and victimization in schools with a sample of 239 students aged 10–16 years old in Rome, Italy. The program deals with bullying and violence. It consists of three videos and a booklet that help students to develop the social cognitive competence skills to understand the negative consequences of aggressive behavior. The intervention was evaluated using an experimental design with pre‐test and post‐test analyses. Students were randomly allocated to experimental or control classes. Students completed a self‐report questionnaire in which they were asked to indicate on a 5–point scale how often they were victimized or bullied others. Victimization and bullying were assessed by using questions about specific types of actions, a composite measure of victimization and bullying, and a single question about victimization and bullying in general. Results showed that the program worked best for older students, but not for younger ones who in some cases reported an increased level of victimization after the intervention. For older students there was a decrease in victimization according to the sum of types of behavior for the experimental group, but an increase for the control group. The same result was found for direct victimization, having belongings stolen, and being called nasty names. Therefore, the program seemed to be beneficial for older students but possibly damaging for younger students. It is suggested that the program could have worked better with older students because of the cognitive skills it required. Younger students could have reported higher levels of bullying after the intervention because they became more sensitized to the topic of bullying. Aggr.

In particular the observations focused on the following behaviors: rejection, destructiveness, negativism, noncompliance, teasing, physical negative, insult, verbal threat, and yelling. Biometrical genetic analysis evidenced significant heritable influences on composite aggression scores in both the observation checklist and the mothers' ratings; heritability estimates varied from.24 to.94 depending on the aggression nieasnre used, with scores from the mothers' observations demonstrating smaller genetic effect than those of the parental ratings of the environmental sources of variance, within-family factors were far more important than the between-family ones. The results also yielded significant sex and zygosity differences for means of some of the specific aggressive behaviors, where males and DZ twins scored higher than females and MZ twins.

    "abstract": "Abstract Violence is a social problem that carries enormous costs; however, our understanding of its etiology is quite limited. A large body of research exists, which suggests a relationship between abnormalities of the frontal lobe and aggression; as a result, many researchers have implicated deficits in so‐called “executive function” as an antecedent to aggressive behaviour. Another possibility is that violence may be related to problems interpreting facial expressions of emotion, a deficit associated with many forms of psychopathology, and an ability linked to the prefrontal cortex. The current study investigated performance on measures of executive function and on a facial‐affect recognition task in 20 violent offenders, 20 non‐violent offenders, and 20 controls. In support of our hypotheses, both offender groups performed significantly more poorly on measures of executive function relative to controls. In addition, violent offenders were significantly poorer on the facial‐affect recognition task than either of the other two groups. Interestingly, scores on these measures were significantly correlated, with executive deficits associated with difficulties accurately interpreting facial affect. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of a broader understanding of violent behaviour. Aggr. Behav. 33:412–421, 2007. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The goal of the current study was to employ meta‐analytic procedures to quantitatively evaluate selected evidence on the relationship between 5‐HIAA and antisocial behavior. It was expected that antisocial groups would show reduced cerebrospinal fluid 5‐HIAA compared with non–antisocial groups. This study also aimed to assess moderators that could influence the relationship between 5‐HIAA and antisociality. An electronic search and strict inclusion criteria identified 20 reports used in this meta‐analysis. Results showed a significant overall mean effect size (ES = –.45, P &lt; .05) in the direction of lowered 5‐HIAA in antisocial vs. non–antisocial groups. A significant moderating effect for age indicated that groups comprised of antisocial individuals younger than 30 years exhibited larger negative effect sizes (ES = –1.37, P &lt; .05) than groups with older subjects (ES = –.31, P &lt; .05). There were no moderating effects for gender, target of violence, history of suicide, and alcoholism. Age effects may help explain age‐related declines in crime. The fact that effects did not differ based on other moderating variables supports models of reduced serotonin in antisocial individuals, regardless of type of crime or psychiatric problems. Aggr.

The twins were measured on two occasions: ages 9-10 years (N=1,241) and 11-14 years (N=874). Reactive and proactive aggressive behaviors were rated by parents. The stability in reactive aggression was due to genetic and nonshared environmental influences, whereas the continuity in proactive aggression was primarily genetically mediated. Change in both reactive and proactive aggression between the two occasions was mainly explained by nonshared environmental influences, although some evidence for new genetic variance at the second occasion was found for both forms of aggression. These results suggest that proactive and reactive aggression differ in their genetic and environmental stability, and provide further evidence for some distinction between reactive and proactive forms of aggression.",

A total of 510 participants in two cohorts of a longitudinal study were involved (116 girls and 104 boys from Grade 4 and155 girls and 135 boys from Grade 7). Patterns of social aggression and physical aggression were identified based on interview reports in the first year of the study. Results showed that a triadic structure of social relationship was often reported in conflicts where social aggression was employed, whereas a dyadic structure was reported in conflicts involving physical aggression. Girls tended to use social aggression against girls, whereas boys tended to use physical aggression against boys. Children and adolescents who were central in peer social networks were more likely to employ social aggression than those who were peripheral in the networks. Social aggression was not reliably linked to concurrent or future problematic adjustment. Physical aggression, however, was not related to network centrality but was linked to concurrent and future maladjustment (e.g., low academic competence and school dropout). Aggr.

    "abstract": "Rough-and-tumble play (RTP) is a common form of play between fathers and children. It has been suggested that RTP can contribute to the development of selfregulation. This study addressed the hypothesis that the frequency of father-child RTP is related to the frequency of physically aggressive behavior in early childhood. This relationship was expected to be moderated by the dominance relationship between father and son during play. Eighty-five children between the ages of 2 and 6 years were videotaped during a free-play session with their fathers in their homes and questionnaire data was collected about father-child RTP frequency during the past year. The play dyads were rated for the degree to which the father dominated play interactions. A significant statistical interaction revealed that RTP frequency was associated with higher levels of physical aggression in children whose fathers were less dominant. These results indicate that RTP is indeed related to physical aggression, though this relationship is moderated by the degree to which the father is a dominant playmate.",

Prosocial behavior and aggression seem to represent opposite ends of a single dimension of behavior since they are consistently negatively related to each other and relate in opposite ways to correlated variables both synchronously and over time. Both are stable forms of behavior with good predictability over the time span studied and both are related to the quality of the parent-child relationship. The most important deterrent to the development of antisocial behavior and the encouragement of prosocial behavior is probably a close identification between the child and his/her parents.",

The objections to this thesis holding that only arbitrary (or illegitimate) frustrations produce aggressive reactions and/or that only controllable and intentional misdeeds give rise to anger are then examined. Evidence is reported showing that frustrations can create an instigation to aggression even when they are not arbitrary or intentionally directed at the person. However, it is argued that the frustration-aggression hypothesis should be revised: Frustrations produce aggressive inclinations only to the extent that they are aversive and give rise to negative affect.

Both versions of the scale were administered to separate samples (nA=294; nT=294). Scales were analysed using item analysis of internal consistency, as well as exploratory factor analysis. Both versions were found to have the same consistent three sub-scales: social exclusion, use of malicious humour, and guilt induction. Preliminary psychometric evaluation suggests that the scales are both sufficiently reliable (with Cronbach's alphas ranging from .81 to .89) and valid. There were no gender differences in either using or being the victim of indirect aggression, and the behaviour was significantly negatively correlated with age.

Measures included exposure to aggression (seeing/hearing about aggression, victimization), emotion regulation (impulsivity, anger control), social cognitions about aggression (self‐evaluation, self‐efficacy, retaliation approval, aggressive fantasizing, caring about consequences), and aggressive behavior. Results supported the hypothesis that social cognitions mediate the relations of exposure to aggression and anger control to aggressive behavior. Also, social cognitions about direct and indirect aggression differentially predicted the respective behaviors with which they are associated. That is, social cognitions about direct aggression were mediators of direct aggressive behavior, whereas social cognitions about indirect aggression were mediators of indirect aggressive behavior. Finally, gender moderated the relations among the variables such that for girls, retaliation approval beliefs were a strong mediator, whereas for boys, self‐evaluation was more important. Aggr.

Other findings included evidence of factorial invariance on the VATVS, and more favorable attitudes toward violence among men than women.

To test the model, families of 310 first grade children and 361 fifth grade children, participating in a universal prevention trial in high‐risk areas of a medium‐sized metropolitan area, provided data. Multi‐method and multi‐source indices of the four predictive constructs (Social Disadvantage, Denial of Care Neglect, Supervisory Neglect, and Punitive Discipline) were obtained at the time of enrollment. Multi‐method and multi‐source indices of the criterion construct (Aggression and Antisocial Behavior) were obtained at the time of enrollment and at a five year follow‐up. Based on structural equation modeling, the results established care neglect as a mediator of social disadvantage, and the importance of care neglect to both punitive discipline and antisocial outcomes in the first‐ and fifth‐grade cohorts. Supervisory neglect, however, was important in the antisocial outcome of the fifth‐grade cohort only. Overall, the results established the importance of distinguishing between two subtypes of neglect and the need to consider the role of discipline in concert with neglect when attempting to understand the impact of parenting on the development of antisocial behavior.

Local microinfusion of vasopressin into the medial amygdala causes an increase in offensive behavior both in gonadally intact males and in animals that were castrated 1 week or 6 months prior to the experiment. The absolute level of offense after arginine-vasopressin (AVP) treatment declined with time after castration indicating that the behavioral consequences of AVP in the Ame are at least partially independent of testosterone. The discussion considers the possibility that AVP in the medial amygdala is involved in the modulatory role of this structure in social learning and memory processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Theoretical models predict that the outcome of dyadic agonistic encounters between males is influenced by resource‐holding potential, resource value, and intrinsic aggressiveness of contestants. Moreover, in territorial disputes residents enjoy a further obvious competitive advantage from the residency itself, owing to the intimate familiarity with their territory. Costs of physical combats are, however, dramatically high in many instances. Thus, signals reliably reflecting fighting ability of the opponents could easily evolve in order to reduce these costs. For example, variation in color morph in polymorphic species has been associated with dominance in several case studies. In this study, we staged asymmetric resident‐intruder encounters in males of the common wall lizard Podarcis muralis , a species showing three discrete morphs (white, yellow, and red) to investigate the effects of asymmetries in color morph, residency, and size between contestants on the outcome of territorial contests. We collected aggression data by presenting each resident male with three intruders of different color morph, in three consecutive tests conducted in different days, and videotaping their interactions. The results showed that simple rules such as residency and body size differences could determine the outcome of agonistic interactions: residents were more aggressive than intruders, and larger males were competitively superior to smaller males. However, we did not find any effect of color on male aggression or fighting success, suggesting that color polymorphism in this species is not a signal of status or fighting ability in intermale conflicts.

In Experiment 1, male sibling pairs engaged in a high level of play fighting during the early juvenile period but such activity declined to a level significantly lower than that of female and mixed-sex pairs after 54 days of age. In Experiment 2, social exchanges during maturation were examined during the presence and absence of the piloerection response in an effort to distinguish play fighting from agonistic interactions. In male pairs, piloerection was rarely seen before 55–75 days of age but thereafter occurred with increasing frequency especially among dominant males. Furthermore, subordinate males retreated from their dominant partners and remained in an escape chamber for a significant amount of time only during encounters involving the exhibition of piloerection. This finding suggests that piloerection can be useful in identifying play and aggressive interactions. In female and heterosexual pairs, piloerection was observed infrequently during social encounters occurring throughout maturation. In addition, when given the opportunity to escape, females were less likely to retreat from play activity if their partner was another female than a male.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Children and adolescents who exhibit a callous interpersonal style seem to be at risk for developing severe forms of violent behavior. Theoretical models suggest that children with low levels of temperamental fearfulness may be at increased risk for developing callous traits because they are relatively unaffected by punishment. This study examines hypotheses about the callousness pathway to severe violent delinquency in a cross‐sectional sample of 169 (97=males, 72=females) adjudicated adolescents. Structural equation modeling is used to test mediation models regarding the relation between temperamental fear, punishment concern, callousness, and severe violent delinquency. The findings of the study indicate that the relation between low levels of temperamental fear and increased callousness is mediated by a lack of concern about being punished for aggressive acts. Although low levels of fear and punishment concern were both related to increased levels of severe violent delinquency, increased levels of callousness mediated these relations. All findings remained significant after controlling for the potential confounds of gender, race, and social desirability. The results provide a heuristic for understanding the callousness pathway to severe violent behavior in youth. However, longitudinal investigations replicating these results are necessary before firm conclusions can be drawn. Aggr. Behav. 32:590–598, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Sociometer theory (Leary et al., 1995) proposes the existence of a psychological mechanism (a \"sociometer\") that enables individuals to detect potential rejection via others' reactions; a properly working sociometer affords a person predictive control over an interaction. We hypothesized the lack of predictive control inherent in previous rejection studies was a critical contributor to participants' aggressive responses; predictive control should lead to decreased aggression. To test this, we manipulated predictive control by varying confederate behavior toward participants before a rejection manipulation. Results indicate that unpredictable rejection undermined participants' belief that they could predict other's behavior (i.e., led to the perception of a broken sociometer) and led to higher levels of aggression.",

    "abstract": "Research has focused on the environmental causes of bullying in prison, but neglected the intrinsic characteristics of bullies. Although the importance of social status in prison has been noted as one factor that may influence bullying, no empirical research has yet addressed this. The main aim of this study was to investigate whether the perceived importance of social status in prison motivates bullying, with the subsidiary aim of exploring whether moral disengagement and prisonization influence the relationship. A total of 132 adult male prisoners were interviewed and categorized as a bully, victim, bully/victim or not involved. The prevalence of bullying was high, with over half the prisoners being both a victim and perpetrator of bullying. As predicted, bullying was positively related to the perceived importance of social status; prisoners involved in bullying valued social status more than those who were not. Furthermore, moral disengagement mediated the relationship between bullying and social status. Prisonization was also related to the perceived importance of social status, moral disengagement and bullying. It is concluded that a desire to achieve social status in prison may contribute to bullying. Furthermore, prisonized attitudes may instill values such as social status into prisoners and may also help facilitate cognitive distortions such as moral disengagement, which in turn, may serve to maintain involvement in bullying activity.

    "abstract": "Abstract There is great concern about the effects of playing violent video games on aggressive behavior. The present experimental study was aimed at investigating the differential effects of actively playing vs. passively watching the same violent video game on subsequent aggressive behavior. Fifty‐seven children aged 10–13 either played a violent video game (active violent condition), watched the same violent video game (passive violent condition), or played a non‐violent video game (active non‐violent condition). Aggression was measured through peer nominations of real‐life aggressive incidents during a free play session at school. After the active participation of actually playing the violent video game, boys behaved more aggressively than did the boys in the passive game condition. For girls, game condition was not related to aggression. These findings indicate that, specifically for boys, playing a violent video game should lead to more aggression than watching television violence. Aggr.

The results showed that adolescents' endorsement of collectivism was negatively related to their use of overt and relational aggression as reported by teachers and peers, whereas positive associations were found between the endorsement of individualism and adolescent aggression. Adolescents' conflict level and social status insecurity accounted for a significant part of these associations. Findings of this study demonstrate the importance of examining intracultural variations of cultural values in relation to adolescent aggression as well as the process variables in explaining the relations.",

Ninety-six adults were randomly assigned to play one of three versions of a computer game that differed only with regard to game content (violent, peaceful, or abstract game), or to work on a reading task. In the games the environmental context, mouse gestures, and physiological arousal-as indicated by heart rate and skin conductance-were kept constant. In the violent game soldiers had to be shot, in the peaceful game sunflowers had to be watered, and the abstract game simply required clicking colored triangles. Five minutes of play did not alter trait aggressiveness, yet an Implicit Association Test detected a change in implicit aggressive self-concept. Playing a violent game produced a significant increase in implicit aggressive self-concept relative to playing a peaceful game. The well-controlled study closes a gap in the research on the causality of the link between violence exposure in computer games and aggressiveness with specific regard to implicit measures.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between social status, shaming experiences, gender and adolescent aggressive behavior by using a status-shaming model. A population-based sample of 5,396 adolescents aged from 15 to 18 completed a questionnaire that asked questions regarding psychosocial background, shaming experiences, social status of family, peer group and school and involvement in physical or verbal aggression at school. Shaming experiences, i.e. being ridiculed or humiliated by others, were strongly related to aggressive behavior. Social status and shaming were related in the prediction of aggressive behavior, suggesting that a person's social status may influence the risk for taking aggressive action when subjected to shaming experiences. Medium social status seemed to have a protective function in the association between shaming experiences and aggression. This study confirms the importance of further evaluation of the role of perceived social status and shaming experiences in the understanding of aggressive behavior. Moreover, the results indicate the need for different kinds of status measures when investigating the associations between status and behavior in adolescent populations. The results may have important implications for the prevention of bullying at school as well as other deviant aggressive behavior among adolescents.",

Second, we tested parenting practices as a moderator of the relation between exposure to military violence and aggressive behavior, and third, whether exposure to military violence of different nature (direct victimization versus witnessing) has specific associations with different forms of aggression (reactive, proactive and aggression‐enjoyment). Study I was conducted in a relatively calm military‐political atmosphere in Palestine‐Gaza, and included 640 children, aged 6–16 years whose parents ( N =622) and teachers ( N =457) provided reports. Older children (≥12 years) provided self‐reports ( N =211). Study II included 225 Palestinian children aged 10–14‐year, who participated during a high‐violence period of the Al Aqsa Intifada characterized by air raids, killing and destruction. Results showed that witnessing severe military violence was associated with children's aggressive and antisocial behavior (parent‐reported) in study I, and with proactive, reactive and aggression‐enjoyment (child‐reported) in the study II.

Although a small body of research exists on girls in the deep end of the system, very few studies have examined the degree of heterogeneity within high‐risk female samples. This study applied latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subgroups of female juvenile offenders based on their self‐report of offending profiles ( N =133). Results supported a three‐class solution with subgroups characterized by patterns of ‘violent and delinquent’, ‘delinquency only’, and ‘low’ offending patterns. The LCA solution was replicated in an independent sample of high‐risk females. The ‘violent and delinquent’ class was characterized by significantly higher rates of DSM‐IV diagnoses for internalizing disorders, affect dysregulation, exposure to violence (within the home, school and neighborhood), and familial histories of criminality.

    "abstract": "Abstract Most studies assessing the link between parental discipline and child aggression have focused primarily on discipline as a cause and aggression as an outcome. In addition to the pathway from discipline to aggression, however, aggressive behavior on the part of the child may lead to future use of discipline by the parent. In this study, structural equation modeling was used to assess reciprocal influences over time between a mothers' use of discipline and aggression in children. Data were drawn from the Springfield Child Development Project, a longitudinal study of middle childhood and adolescence, focusing on antecedents of aggression. The original sample consisted of 440 mother–child dyads living in the city of Springfield, MA. Children in the sample were between 7 and 14 years of age at the first data collection period and between 12 and 19 years of age at the final data collection period. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) a mother's use of aggressive discipline predicts an increase in later child aggression, (2) child aggression predicts an increase in later use of aggressive discipline, (3) the use of reasoning predicts a decrease in later child aggression, and (4) child aggression predicts an increase in later use of reasoning. All hypotheses except number 3 were supported to some degree. Results suggest that children's early aggressive behavior leads to an increase in their mothers' use of both reasoning and aggressive discipline; in turn, increased use of aggressive discipline leads to an increase in aggression during both childhood and adolescence.

The children were asked to evaluate hypothetical rule violations, attribute emotions they would feel in the role of the victimizer, and justify their responses. Compared with younger prosocial children, younger aggressive children attributed fewer negative emotions and were more likely to provide sanction‐oriented justifications when evaluating rule violations negatively. Furthermore, age‐, gender‐ and context‐effects in moral development occurred. The context‐effects included both effects of transgression type (i.e., prosocial morality vs. fairness) on emotion attributions and moral reasoning and the effects of the context of moral evaluation and emotion attribution on moral reasoning.

Results showed that Irritability and Hostile Rumination were highly correlated and stable over time. Four developmental trajectories were identified for both dimensions. Whereas most of the participants demonstrated stable mean levels of Irritability, half of the youth either increased or decreased in their level of Hostile Rumination over time.

    "abstract": "Substantial empirical evidence supports low resting heart rate (HR) as the best replicated psychophysiological correlate of aggression [Ortiz and Raine, 2004]; however, researchers continue to debate the explanatory mechanisms of the phenomenon. Sensation seeking has been proposed as a possible outcome of low resting HR that may lead to aggressive tendencies but findings have been inconsistent in terms of showing a relationship between sensation seeking and aggression. A meta-analysis was conducted on 43 independent effect sizes, from studies with a total of 32,217 participants, to test the hypothesis that sensation seeking would be positively related to aggression across studies. A significant overall effect size was found (d = .1935, P<.001), supporting the hypothesis. Moderator analyses revealed that the relationship differed based on participant and methodological characteristics, such as participant age and the nature of the aggression measurement; however, these conclusions are limited by the uneven number of studies in many of the moderator classes. Overall, the findings provide support for higher levels of aggression in high sensation seekers and have theoretical implications for arousal theory.

Among boys, reactive aggression predicted higher future levels of victimization but was not itself affected by prior victimization. In contrast, boys' proactive aggression predicted lower levels of future victimization and was itself reduced by their prior victimization. Finally, reactive aggression predicted later proactive aggression for both boys and girls.

Experiencing female-female peer victimization was correlated with a later onset of dating behavior, more total dating partners, and less male flirtation while growing up. This report strengthens the connection between adolescent peer aggression and reproductive competition, suggesting a potential functionality to adolescent peer aggression in enhancing one's own mating opportunities at the expense of rivals.",

Our findings indicate that the patterns of offending across the life‐course differ between genders, where males seem to initiate their offending earlier than females. Further, there are very few women on a persistent offending‐trajectory. Focusing on precursors to as well as consequences of offending as indexed in official registers, our results indicate that individuals in the persistent offender group have the most pronounced adjustment problems in school‐ as well as in middle age. Individual characteristics and behaviors (e.g., aggression, hyperactivity, antisocial behavior) vary systematically between individuals with different developmental offending patterns. The combination of an unstable upbringing and own antisocial behavior seems to be especially predictive for criminality. For persistent offenders, the prevalence of alcohol and psychiatric problems at adult age is high for males and extremely high for females (nine out of ten and six out of ten for each of the two problem types for females). Further, the importance for adjustment of the two‐dimensional variation in the number of crimes committed during adolescence and adult age seems to have been surprisingly well captured by the “crude” division into the four offender groups that were used.

Descriptive findings suggest that about 40% of boys and 20% of girls believe that killing a daughter, sister, or wife who has dishonored the family can be justified. A number of theoretically meaningful predictors were examined: Findings suggest that attitudes in support of honor killings are more likely amongst adolescents who have collectivist and patriarchal world views, believe in the importance of female chastity amongst adolescents, and morally neutralize aggressive behavior in general. Findings for parental harsh discipline are mixed: While the father's harsh discipline is predictive of honor killing attitudes, the mother's behavior is not. Furthermore, support for honor killing is stronger amongst male adolescents and adolescents for low education backgrounds. After controlling for other factors religion and the intensity of religious beliefs are not associated with support for honor killings. Models were tested separately for male and female respondents and suggested no systematic differences in predictors. Limitations and implications are discussed. Aggr.

The study sample consisted of 195 children attending the fourth and fifth grade (age 8-10), their mothers and their teachers. A multiinformant approach was used: mothers were interviewed about the temperament of their children; teachers were asked about ADHD symptoms; children responded to a peer nominations inventory designed to investigate their roles as bullies and/or victims and their social preferences (liked and disliked peers). A Structural Equation Model multigroup analysis (males and females) was used to test the relationships among variables hypothesized by the authors. The analysis showed that temperamental variables have a direct relation to ADHD symptoms, that ADHD has a direct relation to bullying behavior in males and to victimization in females and that bullies and victims are less well accepted than peers who belong to neither category. ADHD has only an indirect relation to social preference through the mediating role of school bullying.",

This study sought to provide preliminary molecular genetic evidence in support of these findings. We further evaluated whether genetic associations varied between behavioral subtypes of ASB (i.e., physical aggression and nonaggressive rule‐breaking), given that only the latter has been found to characterize adolescent‐onset ASB. The sample consisted of 211 undergraduate men of European‐American ancestry. Three polymorphisms with theoretical and/or empirical ties to ASB or related traits (i.e., tryptophan hydroxylase‐A218C, 5HT 2A His452Tyr, and the DAT1 variable nucleotide tandem repeat) were genotyped. Analyses revealed that two of the three polymorphisms (i.e., His452Tyr and DAT1) were associated with adolescent ASB. Moreover, these associations appeared to be specific to the nonaggressive, rule‐breaking form of ASB, and did not extend to physical aggression, further supporting ties to adolescent ASB in particular. Such results thus constructively replicate earlier findings of genetic influence on adolescent ASB. They also offer preliminary evidence that the genetic processes underlying aggressive and nonaggressive antisocial behavior may be (at least partially) distinct. Aggr.

We find that respondents are particularly likely to condemn men's assaults on women, and to favor reporting them. The pattern appears to reflect both greater moral condemnation of men's assaults on women and the belief that the victims of these assaults are in greater danger. In general, moral judgments and attitudes toward reporting do not depend on the gender, age, level of education, or political ideology of the respondent. Condemnation of men's violence against women, and support for police intervention when it occurs, are apparently widespread across different segments of the population. Aggr.

The groups were: persistent offenders (offences before and after age 21; 29% of the men); adolescence‐limited offenders (offences before age 21; 27%); adult‐onset offenders (offences after age 21; 16%); and nonoffenders (28%). The profile of the persistent offenders included many characteristics of antisocial personality and problems of social and psychological functioning at all ages. In childhood and adolescence, the adolescence‐limited offenders tended to display higher self‐control than the other offenders indicated by less negative emotionality and higher constraint. In early middle age, they were well established in terms of work and marriage, but they differed from the nonoffenders in higher neuroticism, aggressiveness, and psychosomatic symptoms as did the other offender groups. The adult‐onset offenders displayed an emotionally unstable personality, and in adulthood, they tended to be heavy users of alcohol. Parental SES did not differentiate the groups, but the parents of the persistent offenders tended to use alcohol heavily, and the social capital of the family tended to be low compared with the other groups.

The intermale aggressive behaviour of these animals within their own territory was observed before and after the surgical procedure and compared with the behaviour of sham-operated animals. The effects of anterior VMH lesions include an increased tendency to respond with frontal threatening upon approach of a conspecific male. This behaviour closely resembles the aggressive responses described in “shock-induced aggression” tests. Posterior VMH lesions facilitate territorial aggressive behaviour characterized by approaching the opponent followed by lateral threatening and fighting. It is suggested that 2 distinct neural substrates exist, which serve to inhibit defensive (anterior-VMH) and offensive (posterior-VMH) intermale aggression, respectively.",

Moreover, students with a strong BJW tended to evaluate their teachers' behavior toward them personally to be more just, and the experience of teacher justice mediated the relation between BJW and less bullying perpetration.

Cortical thickness analysis and voxel-based morphometry were analyzed in 47 8-year-old boys (22 DBDs with and without CD and/or ODD and 25 healthy controls) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging brain scans. DBD symptoms were assessed using the Dominic-R. In DBD subjects relative to controls, we found (1) a decreased overall mean cortical thickness; (2) thinning of the cingulate, prefrontal and insular cortices; and (3) decreased gray matter density (GMd) in the same brain regions. We also found that scores on the Dominic-R were negatively correlated with GMd in the prefrontal and precuneus/superior temporal regions. There was a subdiagnostic main effect for CD, related to thinning of the middle/medial frontal, and for ODD in the left rectal/orbitofrontal. Findings suggest that thinning and decreased GMd of the insula disorganizes prefrontal circuits, diminishing the inhibitory influence of the prefrontal cortex on anger, aggression, cruelty, and impulsivity, and increasing a person's likelihood of aggressive behavior. These findings have implications for pathophysiologic models of the DBDs, their diagnostic classification system, and for designing more effective intervention programs. Aggr.

Fast Track provided a multi‐component preventive intervention in the context of a randomized‐controlled design. In addition to psychosocial support and skill training for parents and children, the intervention included intensive reading tutoring in first grade, behavioral management consultation with teachers, and the provision of homework support (as needed) through tenth grade. This study examined the impact of the intervention, as well as the impact of the child's initial aggressive‐disruptive behaviors and associated school readiness skills (cognitive ability, reading readiness, attention problems) on academic progress and educational placements during elementary school (Grades 1–4) and during the secondary school years (Grades 7–10), as well as high school graduation. Child behavior problems and skills at school entry predicted school difficulties (low grades, grade retention, placement in a self‐contained classroom, behavior disorder classification, and failure to graduate).

After controlling for self-report measures of aggressiveness, the Agg-IAT accounted for 9-15% of the variance of three different indicators of aggressive behavior across three studies. To further explore the nomological network around the Agg-IAT we investigated its correlations with measures of social desirability (SD). Although not fully conclusive, the results across four studies provided some support for a weak negative correlation between impression management SD and aggressive behavior as well as the Agg-IAT. This result is in line with an interpersonally oriented self-control account of impression management SD. Individuals with high SD scores seem to behave less aggressively, and to show lower Agg-IAT scores. The one-week stability of the Agg-IAT was r = .58 in Study 4. Aggr.

Data are from an on-going study of male and female African Americans and Puerto Ricans, interviewed at four time waves, Time 1–Time 4 (T1–T4), from adolescence to adulthood. Structural Equation Modeling was used to analyze the developmental pathways, beginning in mid-adolescence (T1; age = 14.0 years), to violent behavior in adulthood (T4; age = 29.2 years). The variables assessed were: components of externalizing behaviors (i.e., rebelliousness, delinquency; T1, T3); illicit drug use (T2); peer delinquency (T2); perceived neighborhood crime (T4); and violent behavior (T3, T4). Results showed that the participants' externalizing behaviors (rebelliousness and delinquency) were relatively stable from mid-adolescence (T1; age = 14.0 years) to early adulthood (T3; age = 24.4 years). The participants' externalizing behaviors in mid-adolescence also had a direct pathway to peer delinquency in late adolescence (T2; age = 19.1 years). Peer delinquency, in turn, had a direct pathway to the participants' illicit drug use in late adolescence (T2), and to externalizing behaviors in early adulthood (T3). The participants' illicit drug use (T2; age = 19.1 years) had both direct and indirect paths to violent behavior in adulthood (T4). The participants' externalizing behaviors in early adulthood (T3) were linked with violent behavior at T3, and perceived neighborhood crime (T4), both of which had direct pathways to violent behavior in adulthood (T4). The findings suggest developmental periods during which externalizing behaviors, exposure to delinquent peers, illegal drug use, and neighborhood crime could be targeted by prevention and intervention programs in order to reduce violent behavior.

The interactive effects between the two facets of aggression and measures of peer rejection and poor parent-adolescent communication in predicting internalizing problems was also examined. Adolescents with high levels of reactive aggression were more likely to exhibit elevated internalizing problems during late adolescence, even when controlling for pre-existing levels of anxiety/depression. However, this association only emerged for adolescents who had high levels of peer rejection and/or poor communication with their parent. Consistent with expectations, proactive aggression was unrelated to internalizing symptoms regardless of social relationship quality. Adolescent reactive, but not proactive, aggression is a risk factor for the development of internalizing problems. However, the findings suggest that interventions designed to foster positive social relationships among reactively aggressive youth may help protect them from developing significant internalizing problems over time.",

    "abstract": "To reduce bullying, more knowledge on children defending their victimized peers is critical. In previous work, predominantly cross‐sectional in nature, defending has typically been operationalized as one single, broad construct. However, there are good reasons to assume that attacking the bully (bully oriented defending) and comforting the victim (victim‐oriented defending) are relatively independent constructs, with potentially different correlates. This longitudinal study in the Netherlands ( N = 394; M age = 10.3) combined person‐ and variable‐centered techniques to examine relations between two different forms of defending and multiple outcome variables. In addition to the largest group scoring low on both types of defending, three subgroups emerged. A small group of “traditional,” predominantly female defenders, scored high on both forms of defending. These children were well liked and high in reputation‐based status, as indexed by perceived popularity and resource control. A larger, predominantly female second group only scored high on victim‐oriented defending. These children were also well liked, but low in reputation‐based status. The third group only scored high on bully oriented defending, and predominantly contained boys. These children were high in reputation‐based status but quite disliked, and they scored high on bullying. Findings strongly suggest that bully oriented defending does not in all cases reflect desirable interventions of empathic children. Aggr. Behav. 42:585–597, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Longitudinal social network modeling (SIENA) was used to study selection processes for aggression while influence processes were controlled for. Furthermore, the effects of network characteristics (i.e., reciprocity and transitivity), gender, and social status on friendship selection were examined. The starting assumption of this study was that selection effects based on aggression might have been overestimated in previous research as a result of failing to consider influence processes and alternative characteristics that steer friendship formation. The results show that selection effects of both physical and relational aggression disappeared when network effects, gender, and social status were taken into account. Particularly gender and perceived popularity appeared to be far more important determinants of friendship selection over time than aggression. Moreover, a peer influence effect was only found for relational aggression, and not for physical aggression. These findings suggest that similarity in aggression among befriended adolescents can be considered to be mainly a by‐product rather than a leading dimension in friendship selection. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Hormonal and neuropsychological impairment in intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators could play a role in domestic violence. For characterizing whether there is a specific psychobiological response to stress, participants who had previously been jailed for IPV and controls were compared for testosterone and cortisol levels, tested for 2D:4D ratio (as an indicator of masculinization), and given several trait questionnaires and neuropsychological tests related to executive functions and theory of mind. After performing the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), IPV perpetrators experienced decreases in salivary testosterone (T) levels, a moderate worsening of mood, slight anxiety, and a salivary cortisol (C) level increase. Moreover, high basal T was related with high levels of anger and anxiety and worse mood. However, that basal mood does not significantly alter T levels in response to stress. Nonetheless, controls experienced smaller changes in T and larger changes in C and psychological mood. With respect to neuropsychological and cognitive empathic features, IPV perpetrators showed poorer executive performance and emotional recognition than controls. In addition, deficits in both neuropsychological domains were positively associated. Regarding emotional empathy, IPV perpetrators showed higher levels of personal distress than controls. The 2D:4D ratio was lower in IPV perpetrators than in controls. Moreover, only in the former a smaller 2D:4D ratio was related to large increases in T in response to stress and poor emotional recognition. Together with social aspects involved in IPV, differences in psychobiological variables and their relationships could play a relevant role in the onset and perpetuation of violent behavior. Aggr.

In this study, we explore the predictive value of an expanded model of aggression motives based on the Quadripartite Violence Typology (QVT), which distinguishes between motivational valence (appetitive or aversive) and recruitment of deliberative self‐control to derive four classes of motives: Rage, Revenge, Reward, and Recreation. With a sample of 1,802 students from grades 7–9, we assessed aggression motives via self‐report, along with self‐report of bullying perpetration and victimization, which were used to assign students into categories of Pure Bully, Bully/Victim (B/V), Pure Victim, and Uninvolved. Two structural models were computed to examine the relationship between these four categories of bullying involvement and aggression motives, using conservative and liberal bullying cutoffs. As predicted, B/V status was more strongly related to Rage and Revenge motives. However, B/Vs had higher scores than Pure Bullies for almost all aggression motives, including Recreation. We discuss the implications of addressing Revenge and Recreation, as well as Reward and Rage (which map most clearly to proactive and reactive aggression, respectively) aggression motives, for bullying prevention and intervention strategies, especially among adolescents for whom extant bullying prevention strategies may be ineffective or counterproductive.",

Participants were 198 fifth grade students (94 girls and 104 boys; Mean age = 10.35 years) from Taipei, Taiwan. Study variables were assessed using peer nomination procedure. Results from the cross‐lagged structural equation models demonstrated that there were longitudinal associations between relational aggression and each of the peer status constructs while only one longitudinal association was found for physical aggression such that physical aggression positively predicted subsequent peer rejection. The longitudinal associations did not vary with gender. Results also showed high stabilities of relational aggression, physical aggression, and the three peer status constructs over 1 year as well as high concurrent association between relational and physical aggression. In addition, relational aggression and physical aggression were concurrently related to less acceptance, more rejection, and less perceived popularity, especially at the outset of the study. Findings of this study demonstrated both similarities and differences in relation to previous literature in primarily Western cultures. This study also highlights the bidirectional and complex nature of the association between aggression and peer status, which appears to depend on the form of aggression and on the particular indicator of peer status under study.

Participants (age range: 18–24) completed measures of the belief that physical strength is irrelevant online and anonymity perceptions at Wave 1, cyberbullying attitudes at Wave 2, and cyberbullying perpetration at Wave 3. Results showed strong support for the BGCM: anonymity perceptions and the belief that physical attributes are irrelevant online at Wave 1 predicted Wave 2 cyberbullying attitudes, which predicted subsequent Wave 3 cyberbullying perpetration.

These results are consistent with social‐cognitive models of social behavior [e.g., the “General Learning Model,” Buckley and Anderson, 2006]. The social‐cognitive learning models suggest that in addition to influencing cognitions, media content may also influence affect. However, past studies on prosocial video games have failed to find a significant effect on affective measures [Greitemeyer and Osswald, 2010]. The present research examined the effects of prosocial, neutral, and violent video games on state hostility and positive affect. Also examined were moderating effects of trait aggressiveness, trait altruistic helping, and trait egoistic helping. Prosocial games reduced state hostility and increased positive state affect. Violent video games had the opposite effects. These effects were moderated by trait physical aggression. Altruistic participants reported relatively more positive affect and less state hostility. Egoistic participants reported relatively more aggravated and mean feelings. Aggr. Behav. 38:263–271, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "School bullying continues to be a serious problem around the world. Thus, it seems crucial to clearly identify the risk factors associated with being a victim or a bully. The current study focused in particular on the role that age and socio‐economic differences between classmates could play on bullying. Logistic and multilevel analyses were conducted using data from 53,316 5th and 9th grade students from a representative sample of public and private Colombian schools. Higher age and better family socio‐economic conditions than classmates were risk factors associated with being a bully, while younger age and poorer socio‐economic conditions than classmates were associated with being a victim of bullying. Coming from authoritarian families or violent neighborhoods, and supporting beliefs legitimizing aggression, were also associated with bullying and victimization. Empathy was negatively associated with being a bully, and in some cases positively associated with being a victim. The results highlight the need to take into account possible sources of power imbalances, such as age and socio‐economic differences among classmates, when seeking to prevent bullying. In particular, interventions focused on peer group dynamics might contribute to avoid power imbalances or to prevent power imbalances from becoming power abuse. Aggr.

    "abstract": "It is well known that violent video games increase aggression, and that stress increases aggression. Many violent video games can be stressful because enemies are trying to kill players. The present study investigates whether violent games increase aggression by inducing stress in players. Stress was measured using cardiac coherence, defined as the synchronization of the rhythm of breathing to the rhythm of the heart. We predicted that cardiac coherence would mediate the link between exposure to violent video games and subsequent aggression. Specifically, we predicted that playing a violent video game would decrease cardiac coherence, and that cardiac coherence, in turn, would correlate negatively with aggression. Participants ( N = 77) played a violent or nonviolent video game for 20 min. Cardiac coherence was measured before and during game play. After game play, participants had the opportunity to blast a confederate with loud noise through headphones during a reaction time task. The intensity and duration of noise blasts given to the confederate was used to measure aggression. As expected, violent video game players had lower cardiac coherence levels and higher aggression levels than did nonviolent game players. Cardiac coherence, in turn, was negatively related to aggression. This research offers another possible reason why violent games can increase aggression—by inducing stress. Cardiac coherence can be a useful tool to measure stress induced by violent video games. Cardiac coherence has several desirable methodological features as well: it is noninvasive, stable against environmental disturbances, relatively inexpensive, not subject to demand characteristics, and easy to use.

    "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of cyberbullying prevention/intervention programs. The goals of the present study were to develop a Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA)‐based video program to increase cyberbullying knowledge (1) and empathy toward cyberbullying victims (2), reduce favorable attitudes toward cyberbullying (3), decrease positive injunctive (4) and descriptive norms about cyberbullying (5), and reduce cyberbullying intentions (6) and cyberbullying behavior (7). One hundred sixty‐seven college students were randomly assigned to an online video cyberbullying prevention program or an assessment‐only control group. Immediately following the program, attitudes and injunctive norms for all four types of cyberbullying behavior (i.e., unwanted contact, malice, deception, and public humiliation), descriptive norms for malice and public humiliation, empathy toward victims of malice and deception, and cyberbullying knowledge significantly improved in the experimental group. At one‐month follow‐up, malice and public humiliation behavior, favorable attitudes toward unwanted contact, deception, and public humiliation, and injunctive norms for public humiliation were significantly lower in the experimental than the control group. Cyberbullying knowledge was significantly higher in the experimental than the control group. These findings demonstrate a brief cyberbullying video is capable of improving, at one‐month follow‐up, cyberbullying knowledge, cyberbullying perpetration behavior, and TRA constructs known to predict cyberbullying perpetration. Considering the low cost and ease with which a video‐based prevention/intervention program can be delivered, this type of approach should be considered to reduce cyberbullying. Aggr.

Socio‐cognitive and moral domain theory suggest that students process teachers’ behavior cognitively and that teachers’ responses to incidents of bullying and victimization could affect students’ level of moral disengagement. We examined the mediating effect of students’ moral disengagement between types of teachers’ responses to situations of bullying and victimization and individual bullying using multilevel mediation modelling. Participants were 609 students (50% boys, age M = 11.47, SD = 1.14) of central Italy, nested in 34 classes. Students rated the frequency of self‐reported bullying and of teachers’ responses to incidents of bullying and victimization on a 5‐point Likert scale. Teachers’ responses to bullying included non‐intervention, mediation, group discussion, and sanctions. Teachers’ responses to victimization included non‐intervention, mediation, group discussion, and victim support. Results indicated that in the teachers’ responses to incidents of bullying model, a significant indirect effect of non‐intervention ( β = .03; 95%CI [.01, .05]) and of sanctions ( β = −.02; 95%CI [−.04, −.01]) on bullying through moral disengagement was found at the individual level. Similarly, in the model on teachers’ responses toward victims there was a significant indirect effect through moral disengagement of non‐intervention ( β = .03; 95%CI [.02, .04]) and victim support ( β = −.01; 95%CI [−.02, −.001]). At the class level there were no significant indirect effects. In sum, results indicated that moral disengagement is an important mediator at the individual level and suggest including teachers in anti‐bullying interventions with a specific focus on their role for moral development.",

Effects of both externalizing (anger) and internalizing (embarrassment/upset) negative emotions were considered. In addition, the moderating roles of gender and impulsivity on the effects of HAB and negative emotional responding were explored. Multilevel models were fitted to data from 2,749 adult twins aged 20–55 from the P enn T wins cohort. HAB was positively associated with all four forms of aggression. There was also a significant interaction between impulsivity and HAB for general aggression. Specifically, the relationship between HAB and general aggression was only significant for individuals with average or above‐average levels of impulsivity. Negative emotional responding was also found to predict all measures of aggression, although in different ways. Anger was positively associated with all forms of aggression, whereas embarrassment/upset predicted decreased levels of general, physical, and verbal aggression but increased levels of relational aggression. The associations between negative emotional responding and aggression were generally stronger for males than females. The current study provides evidence for the utility of HAB and negative emotional responding as predictors of adult aggression and further suggests that gender and impulsivity may moderate their links with aggression.

However, gaming communities are not always welcoming, and some are even perceived as being “toxic.” A prevalent issue is online sexual harassment, which is keeping many women from participating in the gaming community. Research on the factors contributing to the problem is limited, though. The present study replicates and expands previous research, using a sample of 856 online gamers. The study supports earlier findings that found hostile sexism and social dominance orientation as predictors of sexual harassment perpetration in online video games. In addition, we expanded the previous research with additional predictors: machiavellianism, psychopathy, and gamer identification predicted higher sexual harassment perpetration. Our results have implications for the gaming community's role in curtailing sexual harassment and making itself a more inclusive community.",

Specifically, the predictive value of an attentional bias for aggressive stimuli and automatic association of the self and aggression was examined for reactive and proactive aggressive behavior in a non-clinical sample (N = 90). An Emotional Stroop Task was used to measure an attentional bias. With an idiographic Single-Target Implicit Association Test, automatic associations were assessed between words referring to the self (e.g., the participants' name) and words referring to aggression (e.g., fighting). The Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) was used to measure reactive and proactive aggressive behavior. Furthermore, self-reported aggressiveness was assessed with the Reactive Proactive Aggression Questionnaire (RPQ). Results showed that heightened attentional interference for aggressive words significantly predicted more reactive aggression, while lower attentional bias towards aggressive words predicted higher levels of proactive aggression. A stronger self-aggression association resulted in more proactive aggression, but not reactive aggression. Self-reports on aggression did not additionally predict behavioral aggression. This implies that the cognitive tests employed in our study have the potential to discriminate between reactive and proactive aggression. Aggr. Behav. 41:51-64 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Yet, little is known about the overlap of traditional (in‐person) and cyber bullying and sexual harassment perpetration. The present study assessed the co‐occurrence of these forms of aggression in high school and identified middle school predictors based on participants’ perceptions of factors across the social ecology. Racially diverse middle and high school students ( n = 3549) were surveyed over four time points from Spring 2008 to Spring 2013. A latent class analysis was used to identify classes of individuals according to endorsement of traditional and cyber bullying and sexual harassment items in high school. Four classes were identified: (1) high all, consisting of traditional and cyber bullying and sexual harassment perpetration ( n = 227); (2) traditional bullying perpetration ( n = 604); (3) traditional and cyber bullying perpetration ( n = 450); and (4) low all ( n = 1,261). Students who reported high levels of anger, self‐esteem, empathy, pornographic exposure, and traditional masculinity (individual level), lower levels of social support and parental monitoring (relational level), and higher levels of school belonging (community level) had increased odds of being in the high all class when compared to the other classes. Given the co‐occurrence of traditional and cyber bullying and sexual harassment, prevention programming that addresses both forms of aggression across traditional and online contexts may be beneficial. This study also suggests the importance of comprehensive prevention efforts that incorporate approaches at the different ecological levels, such as teaching adolescents healthy emotional and interpersonal skills, and engaging parents in prevention.",

    "abstract": "This short‐term longitudinal study examined whether the association between bullying perpetration and later physical dating violence perpetration and mediators of that association (via anger, depression, anxiety, and social status), varied depending on level of bullying victimization. Differences have been noted between those who bully but are not victims of bullying, and those who are both bullies and victims. These differences may influence dating violence risk and the explanations for why bullying leads to dating violence. Data were from dating adolescents in three rural counties who completed self‐administered questionnaires in the fall semester of grades 8–10 and again in the spring semester. The sample ( N = 2,414) was 44.08% male and 61.31% white. Bullying perpetration in the fall semester predicted physical dating violence perpetration in the spring semester when there was no bullying victimization, but not when there was any bullying victimization. Bullying perpetration was positively associated with anger at all levels of bullying victimization and with social status when there was no or low amounts of victimization; it was negatively associated with social status at high levels of victimization. Bullying victimization was positively associated with anger, depression, and anxiety at all levels of bullying perpetration. Anger mediated the association between bullying perpetration and dating violence, regardless of level of victimization; depression, anxiety, and social status did not mediate the association at any level of bullying victimization. The findings have implications for dating violence prevention efforts and for future research on the link between bullying and dating violence. Aggr.

Twenty 10th graders were observed over the course of one academic year as they interacted with their peers and teachers. The observations helped us identify dispositional and situational factors which influenced participant roles. In-depth interviews of students involved in school bullying showed how participants interpreted and explained their classroom behaviors. The analysis of the data gathered allowed the identification of four main actor roles recognized in the existing literature on bullying-the pure victim, the pure bully, the provocative-victim, and the bystander-as well as the differentiation between aggressive bullies and the bully managers. Most roles fluctuated according to specific circumstances and often appeared to be moderated by the teacher's management style and contextual variables. Some pupils assumed different roles in different contexts, sometimes changing roles within or between episodes. Teacher personality and style also had an impact on the frequencies and types of aggression and victimization. The use of an ethnographic research paradigm is discussed as an important supplement to positivistic studies of school bullying.",

    "abstract": "Hostile people tend to view the world as a hostile place. Although there are individual differences in hostile world‐views, situational factors can also play a role. For example, scenes of violence in the mass media might influence people to view the world as a hostile place. This meta‐analysis aggregates, for the first time, all studies that have investigated the link between exposure to violent media and hostile appraisals (e.g., perceiving the ambiguous actions by others as aggressive actions). This meta‐analysis included 37 independent studies involving 10,410 participants. The results showed a “small” to “moderate” sized average correlation between exposure to violent media and hostile appraisals ( r + = .20, 95%CI = .14, .26). Significant correlations were found in experimental, cross‐sectional, and longitudinal studies, indicating a triangulation of evidence. Effects were not correlated with participant gender. Effects were also stable over time. However, the link between exposure to violent media and hostile appraisals was positively related to age, perhaps because violent media can have cumulative effects over time. There was no evidence of publication bias. The findings from this meta‐analysis are consistent with the General Aggression Model (e.g., Anderson, &amp; Bushman, 2002; Annual Review of Psychology 53:27–51). These results compliment those from previous meta‐analyses showing that violent media can increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior. These findings also have practical significance, because people who view the world in a hostile manner are more likely to behave aggressively themselves. Aggr.

Participants consisted of 536 students in Grade 9 (age 15), recruited from a community sample, who were assessed on a yearly basis until they were in Grade 11 (age 17). Adolescents self-reported their use of direct and indirect aggression, social status, and number of dating partners. A cross-lagged panel model that controlled for within-time covariance and across-time stability while examining cross-lagged pathways was used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that direct aggression did not predict dating behavior and was negatively associated with self-perceived social status in Grade 10. Self-perceived social status in Grade 9 was positively associated with greater use of indirect aggression in Grade 10. Regarding dating, in Grade 9, self-perceived social status positively predicted more dating partners the following year, while in Grade 10, it was higher levels of indirect aggression that predicted greater dating activity the following year. Overall, there were no significant sex differences in the model. The study supports the utility of evolutionary psychological theory in explaining peer aggression, and suggests that although social status can increase dating opportunities, as adolescents mature, indirect aggression becomes the most successful and strategic means of competing intrasexually and gaining mating advantages.",

Although both constructs are linked to predatory violence, few studies have sought to explore the covariation of the two constructs, and even fewer have sought to conceptualize the similarities of violence prediction in each. The current study considered all four Psychopathy Checklist‐Revised (PCL‐R) facets and employed well‐defined, validated measures of sadism to elucidate the relation between sadism and psychopathy, as well as to determine the role of each in the prediction of non‐sexual violence and sexual crime behaviors. Study 1 assessed 314 adult, male sex offenders using archival ratings, as well as the self‐report Multidimensional Inventory of Development, Sex, and Aggression (the MIDSA). Study 2 used archival ratings to assess 599 adult, male sex offenders. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of crime scene descriptions yielded four sexual crime behavior factors: Violence, Physical Control, Sexual Behavior, and Paraphilic. Sadism and psychopathy covaried, but were not coextensive; sadism correlated with Total PCL‐R, Facet 1, and Facet 4 scores. The constructs predicted all non‐sexual violence measures, but predicted different sexual crime behavior factors. The PCL‐R facets collectively predicted the Violence and Paraphilic factors, whereas sadism only predicted the Violence factor. Aggr. Behav. 40:12–23, 2014. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Child and adolescent physical aggression are influenced by multiple contexts, such as peers, family, school, and neighborhood. However, the effect of neighborhoods on youth physical aggression remains unclear. The objective of this study was to quantitatively synthesize studies that have examined the effect of neighborhood disadvantage on physical aggression in children and adolescents and to identify potential moderators. We searched seven databases for articles published before April 25, 2015. Studies were considered eligible if they were published in peer-reviewed journals, used multilevel data, controlled for neighborhood clustering, used physical aggression as the study outcome, and considered children or adolescents as the study population. Of the 152 eligible studies, we included 43 in the meta-analysis. The results from the random-effects model revealed that neighborhood disadvantage was positively and significantly associated with physical aggression (P < .001). Metaregression and moderator analyses further indicated a stronger association between neighborhood disadvantage and physical aggression among studies with younger participants, a higher percentage of female participants, and a longer follow-up period (P < .05). Current findings, however, may not be generalized to other types of aggression. The observed neighborhood effects may also be limited because of the omission of studies that did not provide sufficient information for calculating the pooled effect. In summary, the results provide supporting evidence for the adverse effect of living in disadvantaged neighborhoods on physical aggression after adjusting for the individual-level characteristics of children and adolescents. Interventions targeting structural contexts in neighborhoods are required to assist in reducing physical aggression in young people. Aggr. Behav. 42:441-454, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Findings indicate that premeditated, but not impulsive, aggression predicts violent recidivism.

    "abstract": "Relational aggression refers to harming others through damaging or manipulating peer relationships. In a cohort of students surveyed annually from middle to high school, this study identified groups of adolescents who followed distinct trajectories of perpetration and of victimization of relational aggression, compared the proportion of boys and girls in each trajectory, and examined the overlap between perpetration and victimization trajectories. The sample consisted of 620 randomly selected sixth graders. Students completed yearly surveys from Grade 6–12. We used group‐based trajectory modeling to identify the trajectories. Adolescents followed three developmental trajectories of perpetration and three similar trajectories of victimization: Low (lowest aggression), Moderate, and High Declining (high in middle school, with a steep decline in high school). All trajectories declined from Grade 6–12. The largest groups were the Low perpetration (55%) and Low victimization (48%). Relational aggression trajectories differed by gender: more boys reported perpetration, and more girls reported victimization. For perpetration, slightly more boys than girls were classified in the two trajectories of higher aggression. For victimization, significantly fewer girls than boys were classified in the Low trajectory, and significantly more girls than boys were classified in the Moderate trajectory. There was substantial overlap of the perpetration and victimization trajectories. These findings highlight the importance of implementing programs to reduce relational aggression for boys and for girls. Aggr. Behav. 41:401–412, 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The results provide evidence of fWHR being associated with sporting performance and aggression in men. However, it has been argued that the effect of fWHR might be a by‐product of associations between body size and behavioral measures. Here we tested whether fWHR is associated with perceived aggressiveness, fighting ability and success in physical confrontation, while controlling for body size, also in a sample of MMA fighters. We found that perceived fighting ability was predicted by weight but not by fWHR. In contrast, both fWHR and body weight independently predicted perceived aggressiveness. Furthermore, we found positive associations between fWHR and fighting performance which appear to be independent of body size. Our findings provide further support for the proposal that fWHR is associated with fighting ability and perceived aggression, and that these effects are independent of body size. Therefore, fWHR might be considered as a viable and reliable marker for inference of success in male intra‐sexual competition. Aggr. Behav. 41:331–334, 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

As a result, elevated aggressive behavior in adolescence may signal atypical development and greater vulnerability for negative mental and health outcomes. Converging evidence suggests that brain disturbances in regions involved in impulse control, emotional regulation, and sensation seeking may contribute to heightened aggression. However, little is known regarding the neural mechanisms underlying subtypes of aggression (i.e., proactive and reactive aggression) and whether they differ between males and females. Using a sample of 106 14‐year‐old adolescent twins, this study found that striatal enlargement was associated with both proactive and reactive aggression. We also found that volumetric alterations in several frontal regions including smaller middle frontal and larger orbitofrontal cortex were correlated with higher levels of aggression in adolescent twins. In addition, cortical thickness analysis showed that thickness alterations in many overlapping regions including middle frontal, superior frontal, and anterior cingulate cortex and temporal regions were associated with aggression in adolescent twins.

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent years have witnessed an increase of research on socio‐affective factors that can explain individual differences in aggressive tendencies across community and offender populations. Specifically, mindfulness and emotion regulation have emerged as important factors, which could also constitute important prevention and treatment targets. Yet, recent studies have advanced the possibility that mindfulness may also have a “dark” side, being associated with increased levels of aggression‐related variables, especially when accounting for the variance associated with emotion regulation. The present study sought to elucidate relationships among mindfulness, emotion regulation, and aggression dimensions (i.e., verbal and physical aggression, anger, and hostility) across violent offender ( N = 397) and community ( N = 324) samples. Results revealed expected associations between both mindfulness and emotion regulation and aggression dimensions, such that greater impairments in mindfulness and emotion regulation were related to increased levels of aggression across samples. Further, analyses of indirect effects revealed that a latent emotion dysregulation factor accounted for (i.e., mediated) relationships between mindfulness facets and aggression dimensions in both samples. Previously reported positive associations between the residual variance in mindfulness scales (i.e., controlling for emotion regulation) and aggression‐related variables were not replicated in the current samples. Taken together, findings suggest that mindfulness and emotion regulation have unequivocal relations with lower levels of aggression, and should therefore be considered as relevant targets for prevention and treatment programs aimed at reducing aggressive tendencies.",

We recruited 547 undergraduates (48.45% male) from five Chinese universities. The results showed that VVGE was positively associated with moral disengagement, disinhibition, and the four aggressive traits (physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility), which were positively associated with each other. Moral disengagement was positively associated with both the disinhibition and the four aggressive traits. Disinhibition was positively associated with the four aggressive traits as well. When controlled for gender, moral disengagement, anger, and hostility wholly mediated the relationship between VVGE and aggression, but the moderation effect of disinhibition was not significant. These findings support the framework of GAM and indicate that moral disengagement, anger, and hostility may be the factors that increase the risk of a higher level of aggression following repeated exposure to violent video games.",

However, these measures have also been criticized. In particular, the competitive reaction time task (CRTT) has been criticized for allowing aggression to be operationalized in multiple ways, leaving it susceptible to “ p ‐hacking.” This article describes the development of the CRTT and the ways in which its paradigm flexibility and analytic flexibility allows it to test a wide range of hypotheses and research questions. This flexibility gives the CRTT significant scientific utility, but as with any research paradigm, comes with the obligation that it has to be used with integrity. Although safeguards exist and there is little evidence of misuse, study preregistration can increase confidence in CRTT findings. The importance of findings such as those of Hyatt et al.

Using the General Aggression Model (Anderson &amp; Bushman, 2002) as a theoretical framework, this meta‐analytic review synthesizes the literature on the effects of sexualized media (both violent and nonviolent) on aggression‐related thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors. Our sample includes 166 independent studies involving 124,236 participants, which yielded 321 independent effects. Overall, the effects were “small” to “moderate” in size ( r = .16 [.14–.18]). Significant correlations were found in experimental, cross‐sectional, and longitudinal studies, indicating a triangulation of evidence. Effects were stronger for violent sexualized media ( r = .25 [.19–.31]) than for nonviolent sexualized media ( r = .15 [.13–.17]), although the effects of nonviolent sexualized media were still significant and nontrivial in size. Moreover, the effects of violent sexualized media on aggression were greater than the effects of violent non‐sexualized media on aggression obtained in previous meta‐analyses. Effects were similar for male and female participants, for college students and non‐students, and for participants of all ages. The effects were also stable over time. Sensitivity analyses found that effects were not unduly influenced by publication bias and/or outliers. In summary, exposure to sexualized media content, especially in combination with violence, has negative effects on women, particularly on what people think about them and how aggressively they treat them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Adolescents' involvement in cyberbullying has been a growing public health concern for some time. Cybervictimization and cyberaggression are two phenomena that previous research has often shown to be associated. However, longitudinal research into these associations and also into potential risk factors for these phenomena is less common. Anger rumination is a proven risk factor for aggressive behavior, but the relationship between anger rumination and victimization is not clear. The present longitudinal study investigated the associations between cybervictimization, anger rumination and cyberbullying in a sample of 3017 adolescents ( M W1 = 13.15; SD = 1.09; 49% girls) from 7th to 9th grade. The European Cyberbullying Intervention Project Questionnaire and the Anger Rumination Scale were administered in four waves with 6 months intervals over a total period of 18 months. The associations between the variables were analyzed with a cross‐lagged model. We found that: cybervictimization predicted anger rumination and cyberaggression; anger rumination was associated with later increases in both cybervictimization and cyberaggression: but involvement in cyberaggression predicted neither subsequent involvement in cybervictimization, nor in anger rumination. In addition, cybervictimization was found to mediate the association between anger rumination and cyberaggression. This study expands the understanding of the factors associated with cybervictimization and cyberaggression, and its results indicate that intervention programs should focus on boosting self‐control to decrease impulsive behavior and protocols to prevent and intervene in cyberbullying.",

A total of 2097 Hungarian gamers (88.5% male, Mage = 26.2 years, SD = 6.8) completed an online questionnaire. Most (66%) were victims of such incidents in the past year, and gamers considered the problem of toxic behaviors as severe. Younger gamers who spent more time playing competitive videogames (especially multiplayer online battle arena and shooter games) were more likely to experience toxic behaviors from others. Repeatedly victimized gamers reported more symptoms of depression and problematic videogame use, while victim/perpetrators expressed higher anxiety and anger rumination.

    "abstract": "Abstract Social rejection elicits profound feelings of distress. From an evolutionary perspective, the best way to alleviate this distress is to behave prosocially, minimizing the likelihood of further exclusion. Yet, examples ranging from the playground to the pub suggest rejection commonly elicits aggression. Opposing theoretical perspectives and discordant empirical results have left a basic question unanswered: does rejection more commonly elicit prosocial or aggressive behavior? We conducted three meta‐analyses (one with studies measuring aggressive behavior; one with studies measuring prosocial behavior; and one with studies measuring both aggressive and prosocial behavior; N = 3864) to quantify: (1) the extent to which social rejection elicits prosocial or aggressive behavior and (2) potential moderating effects on these relations. Random‐effects models revealed medium effects such that social rejection potentiated aggressive behavior ( k = 19; d = 0.41, p &lt; .0001) and attenuated prosocial behavior ( k = 7; d = 0.59, p &lt; .0001), an effect that remained consistent even when participants were given the option to behave prosocially or aggressively ( k = 15; d = 0.71, p &lt; .0001). These results cast doubt on the theory that rejection triggers prosocial behavior, and instead suggest it is a robust elicitor of aggression. Statement of Relevance : To our knowledge, these meta‐analyses are the first to directly test whether social rejection elicits aggressive or prosocial behavior. By including a comprehensive collection of both published and unpublished research studies, and examining a wide variety of previously untested moderators, we show that social rejection robustly elicits aggressive behavior and inhibits prosocial behavior. Additionally, we demonstrate that aggressive behavior following social rejection is not simply a function of limited choices in response options. In fact, aggressive behavior was evoked even when the option to engage in prosocial behavior was provided. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive narrative review of the neural mechanisms underlying social rejection‐elicited aggressive and prosocial behavior to supplement primary analyses. Overall, we believe that our work makes a critical theoretical contribution to the field.",

Individuals with a high degree of identification with their favorite team were particularly likely to consider such acts. The current investigation was designed to extend this research by examining the likelihood that individuals would consider engaging in hostile anonymous aggression. It was expected that highly identified persons would be particularly likely to consider these acts, even though the acts would not provide a competitive advantage for their team. Data collected from 175 university students confirmed the expectations. In addition, the results indicated that males were more likely than females to report a willingness to consider the hostile aggressive acts and that participants were more likely to report a willingness to engage in less destructive acts (e.g., tripping an opposing player or coach) than more destructive acts (e.g., murdering an opposing player or coach).

Three hundred fifty‐three participants responded to eight hypothetical scenarios that may elicit vengeful behavior in which the offending party was either a romantic partner, a friend, a coworker, or a stranger. Participants also completed a vengeance scale and a measure of biblical literalism. Participants were most vengeful toward coworkers and least vengeful toward romantic partners. Age, religious conservatism, and gender were significant predictors of attitudes toward vengeance. Although men were more likely than women to be accepting of vengeful attitudes as measured by the vengeance scale, only age was a significant predictor of behavior in the vengeance scenarios.

Personality and cognitive factors that influence the interpretation given to such competitions may influence the impact of these events. The effects of exposure to a sporting competition that had high or low importance for subjects' social identity on pre- to post-film blood pressure and evaluations of outgroups were examined. Aggression may be particularly likely when arousal levels are elevated, and such arousal was expected to be determined by the importance of the identity at stake, regardless of the outcome of the competition. Individuals who were either strongly identified with America or were less identified viewed a boxing match where the American athlete lost the competition (and the Russian contestant won), or the Russian athlete lost (and the American won). Both diastolic and systolic blood pressure measures showed an increase pre- to post-film in the highly identified persons while no such change was observed in the low identitied individuals. Cognitive measures assessing evaluations of the Russian boxer, and Russians in general, showed effects parallel to the arousal indexes with high identified persons expressing more derogation of threat-relevant targets than did those low in identification. Arousal increases in only the highly identified viewers predicted derogation of Russians. Discussion centers on the role of identification with a sports team on physiological processes and their implications for spectator aggression.",

Levels of aggression were examined using self ratings, peer ratings, and observations. The latter were collected during the mid‐morning and lunchtime breaks using a wireless microphone and hidden video camera. Beliefs about aggression were assessed using modified versions of Campbell et als.' [1992] EXPAGG questionnaire. The results revealed significantly higher levels of observed physical aggression amongst boys as compared to girls. However, although the means were generally in the directions predicted, there were no other significant sex differences, nor interactions between sex and age. The results also showed limited support for claims that instrumental versus expressive beliefs about aggression influence behaviour. Beliefs generally showed significant correlations with reported and observed levels of aggression, and three of these remained significant even after the variance associated with sex and age had been partialled out. On the basis of these results, we call for more longitudinal research while simultaneously acknowledging the possibility that children's beliefs about aggression and their aggressive behaviours may be shaped independently from one another.

Improvement of the school as an organisation and improved, general classroom management are two central aspects in the recent approach, which is supposed to have multiple effects.

Previous research has mainly focused on violence in the media rather than examining this more manipulative and subtle type of aggression. A content analysis of 228 hours of television programming revealed that indirect aggression was portrayed in 92.04% of all episodes analyzed. It was portrayed more frequently than physical and verbal aggression. Females were more likely to be shown as indirect aggressors than were males, while males were more likely to be portrayed as physical aggressors. Attractive aggressors were more likely to use indirect than other types of aggression. Indirect aggression was often found to be justified, realistic, and rewarded. We conclude that programs that are not considered violent may still contain a large amount of other types of aggression. Aggr. Behav. 30:254–271, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous research has suggested that bullying is an increasingly severe problem in schools. Such research has approached the phenomenon from two different angles. Earlier research has treated bullying and victimisation as separate entities. However, current research suggests that bullies and victims engage in a special dynamic and interactive relationship, thereby providing the need for studying any similarities and differences between bullies and victims in relation to various factors. The present research has approached bullying and victimisation in both ways. First, we studied differences between bullies, victims, and those not involved in relation to various demographic, school, well‐being, and personality factors to identify factors that separate these three groups. In addition, we studied differences between those involved in bullying/victimisation (one group) and those never involved in relation to the same aforementioned factors to highlight aspects of the development of their special relationship (i.e., common factors). Prevalence rates and types of bullying/victimisation experienced/expressed in Scottish schools were also investigated. It was found that bullying and victimisation, when treated as separate entities, differed in relation to peer self‐esteem, with bullies reporting higher levels of peer self‐esteem than victims. When bullies and victims were treated as one group (involved), they were found to differ from the noninvolved group in relation to various factors, including school, well‐being, and personality factors. The involved group was found to be disadvantaged in relation to all measures used. However, overall results indicated that from all these factors the best predictors of overall involvement as bully, victim, or bully‐victim were Quality of School Life and school stress. The present results support the notion that bullying and victimisation could be treated, by future research, as both separate and/or interactive entities. This is so because bullying and victimisation were found to differ in relation to one personality factor, that is, peer self‐esteem. However, Quality of School Life and school stress, both school factors, were found to be associated with the phenomenon as a whole. Results are discussed in relation to future development of antibullying policy in Scottish schools.Aggr. Behav. 28:45–61, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Two recently developed questionnaire measures of aggression, the Aggression Questionnaire [Buss and Perry (1992; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 63:452–459]; and the Aggression Inventory [Gladue (1991a); Psychological Reports 68:675–684], were administered to a British sample (N=320) of men and women undergraduates. Both questionnaires contain subscales measuring physical and verbal aggression; the other scales of the Aggression Questionnaire measure anger and hostility, and those of the Aggression Inventory measure impulsiveness and avoidance of aggression. The factor structure of scales were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. The interrelations of the subscales were calculated in both cases: anger was independently related to verbal and physical aggression and to hostility on the Aggression Questionnaire; impulsivity, and verbal and physical aggression were associated on the Aggression Inventory. Sex differences were largest on the two physical subscales, of lesser magnitude but still significantly different for the two verbal subscales, but absent for anger and hostility. This supports the hypothesis that sex differences in aggression are larger for more escalated forms of aggression. The physical and verbal subscales of the two questionnaires were each highly correlated with one another and the impulsive subscale of the Aggression Inventory highly correlated with the anger subscale of the Aggresion Questionnaire. Thus, two aggression questionnaires developed in the US not only produce similar associations between subscales and sex differences among a British undergraduate sample, but also show high correlations between their respective scales. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Research on the resolution of interpersonal conflict has shown that forgiveness is important in reducing aggression and promoting prosocial interactions following a transgression. Although the benefits of forgiveness have been demonstrated in a variety of relationship contexts, a single theoretical model has not been tested across these different contexts. In this study, we employed an attributional framework to examine the relationship between attributions of responsibility for a transgression, repentance, emotions, forgiveness, and psychological aggression toward three different categories of transgressor: a coworker, a friend, and a romantic partner. One hundred and seven participants were asked to describe a recent transgression with a coworker, a friend, and a romantic partner. In each case, responsibility for the event, the degree to which the transgressor apologized, anger, sympathy, forgiveness, and subsequent psychological aggression toward the transgressor were measured. A basic model of aggression reduction, whereby repentance facilitates forgiveness and reduces psychological aggression, was reliable in each category of transgressor. A comparison of the models showed minor differences in how individuals respond to transgressors. Although coworkers apologized less, they were just as likely to be forgiven as romantic partners and friends. In addition, participants were least likely to respond with psychological aggression when a friend transgressed against them. This research provides a theoretical framework within which to study forgiveness and aggression across a variety of contexts. Aggr. Behav. 32:1–12, 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

This paper reports results for physical victimization and also reports on two further questions asked to discern context and meaning ascribed to such sustained or inflicted victimization. Both sexes reported having experienced physical victimization with a higher percentage of men sustaining victimization, mainly as a result of minor acts of assault. Almost equal percentages of men and women reported inflicting victimization against partners. Additionally, incidence of physical victimization is presented according to relationship status, age, socioeconomic category, and by regional distribution.

According to the answers provided by 257 fifth and seventh graders (mean age 11.4 and 13.5, respectively) in the Peer Estimated Conflict Behavior Questionnaire, four types of ratings were calculated: same- and opposite-gender rating, rating by both genders, and self-report. Additionally, teacher ratings were collected. In contrast to earlier findings, boys were found to be directly, as well as indirectly, more aggressive than girls, thus challenging the universality of indirect aggression as a strategy more frequently employed by girls. Consistencies among different informants varied, with peers showing the strongest agreement with each other and self-views conforming the least to other ratings.Aggr.

The first is a replication of two recent findings, that for students trained traditionally, length of training varies inversely with aggressiveness, whereas for students trained in a \"modern\" style, length of training and aggressiveness are related directly. Second, we examine two competing explanations for the findings above. One is the training hypothesis, which holds that elements present in traditional approaches to martial arts but absent in modern approaches act to reduce aggression levels of students. These may include meditation, philosophy, emphasis on the kata (the forms of combat), etc. The alternate hypothesis, selection, holds instead that these findings are artifactual, a result of differential mortality in a setting characterized by high drop-out rates. Two categories of students were interviewed: \"movers,\" students who had trained in more than one school, and \"quitters,\" students who had terminated their training, for any reason. These students were compared with \"stayers\" from an earlier study. Our results are consistent with the opposite effects of traditional and modern martial arts training on aggressiveness. Further, the data generally support the training hypothesis as against selection.",

Adult and young male offenders (n = 220) were required to complete a self‐report behavioural checklist (DIPC: Direct and Indirect Prisoner behaviour Checklist: Ireland, 1999a) that addressed the level of bullying behaviour at their present institution. Offenders were also required to complete a measure of attachment, namely the Three Attachment Style Measure [Hazan and Shaver, 1987] exploring secure, avoidant and anxious/ambivalent styles, and a measure of emotional loneliness, namely the revised UCLA Loneliness scale [Russell, Peplaw and Cutrona, 1980]. Young offenders were more likely than adult offenders to report behaviours indicative of ‘bullying others’ and of ‘being bullied.’ With regards to attachment style and bullying behaviour, significant differences were restricted to avoidant attachment; bully/victims reported higher avoidant scores than the other bully‐categories, with pure bullies and those not‐involved reporting lower avoidant scores. Finally, when considering emotional loneliness and bullying behaviour, bully/victims reported higher scores on emotional loneliness than the other bully‐categories, with the not‐involved group reporting significantly lower scores.

Stability of aggression from the age of 8 to 14 was as high for girls as for boys when peer nomination was employed, but lower for girls in teacher rating. For males, both peer nominations and teacher ratings on aggression at age 8 and 14 predicted criminality, arrests for alcohol abuse, and problem drinking as well as self-reports on aggression at age 26. The outcomes were most negative if aggression was patterned with other adjustment problems. For females, teacher ratings on agression were biased by school adjustment, and they predicted arrests for alcohol abuse and problem drinking; peer nominations predicted self-reports on aggression. Developmental trajectories for physically aggressive girls differed from those for verbally and facially aggressive girls, the former being less oriented to education. Sex differences did not exist in the amount of aggression when measured with peer nominations, but boys were more aggressive when measured with teacher ratings. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Using youth's self‐reports, this study assessed the associations of relational and physical aggression with indicators of both personal gains in peer relations (perceived popularity and receipt of prosocial attention) and personal costs in terms of retaliation or depressive responses (peer victimization and depressive symptoms) in a large sample ( n =455) of eighth‐ to tenth‐grade students. Regression analyses reveal that more relationally aggressive youth report more prosocial attention but also more relational (but not physical) victimization. In contrast, more physically aggressive youth report more depressive symptoms and physical (but not relational) victimization. Findings suggest that some costs of aggression (victimization) are higher for boys while others (depressive symptoms) are greater for girls. Group differences were also found for aggressive, victimized, and aggressive/victimized youth compared to the typical low aggressive/low victimized youth. These data suggest that the costs of relational and physical aggression may outweigh benefits except for aggressive non‐victimized boys. Aggr. Behav. 32:409–419, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Children were assigned to roles in aggression (Aggressor, Victim, Defender, Supporter, and Bystander) on the basis of peer, teacher, and self‐nominations. The roles taken in aggression were examined in relation to individuals' physical strength, social status, and social development. The coping strategies used by victims were also examined. Aggressive children were found to be socially rejected. Defenders were found to be the most popular children in the class, which may place them better to defend others without fear of reprisal or they may gain their status from the act of defending others. The findings also indicate that young victims do not exhibit the characteristics of older victims (e.g., social rejection and physical weakness), which confirms findings with 4‐ to 6‐year‐olds in England [Monks et al. 2002a, 2002b]. It is suggested that these findings relate to the instability of victimisation at this age. Aggr. Behav. 28:458–476, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Behavior delivering noxious stimuli was defined as defensive when it was a response a threatening situation and as offensive when it was an unprovoked act. The existence of a general aggression factor was implied by the finding that initiators of aggression also readily defend themselves if attacked. The use of a peer nomination and teacher rating variable for offensive aggression, \"Attacks without reason, teases others, naughty things\"; and another for defensive aggression, \"Defends him/herself if teased, but does not tease or attack others without reason,\" yielded differential results. Offensive aggression at age 14 was significantly predicted by aggressive behavior age 8, while defensive aggression was not. Intercorrelations of rating variables at 14 showed that offensive aggression was related to weak self-control and defensive aggression to strong self-control. Only offensive aggression at age 14 predicted criminality at age 20. The results indicate a diversity of motivations for aggressive behaviors, as suggested by observations on animal behavior.",

Repeated defeat experiences in daily agonistic confrontations induced dramatic changes in behaviors as well as in the somatic state of submissive mice (losers) that were similar to symptoms of human depression with respect to etiology, susceptibility to treatment, and symptomatology. A remarkable behavioral deficit was found in losers, who demonstrated only a passive defense and immobile postures after 20 daily defeats (tests) instead of active defense and withdrawal, which had predominated in the first confrontations. Losers never demonstrated any aggression to other individuals and displayed a decrease in ambulation in the open-field test as well as an increase in immobility time in Porsolt's test. The development of anxiety and disturbance in communicative behavior were observed in losers. Loss of weight and enhancement of gastric mucosa damage, as well as a decrease in plasma testosterone level and immune resistance, were shown in losers. Chronic imipramine and tianeptine treatment prevented the increase of \"depressiveness\" as estimated by Porsolt's test. Chronic unavoidable social stress is considered a pathogenic factor, which leads to the development of depressive pathology and anxiety in mice. The study on brain monoaminergic activity in losers at different stages of the experimental depression allows the hypothesis that the development of depression is accompanied by dynamic changes in turnover and reception of at least brain serotonin, depending on the duration and depth of the pathological depressive processes. Behavioral and physiological markers of a depression-like state in losers are discussed in comparison with those of human depressive disorder. Aggr. Behav. 24:271–286, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Participants completed an adapted version of the EXPAGG [Archer and Haigh (1997a): British Journal of Social Psychology 35:1–23] to measure I and E beliefs about aggression, the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) [Straus (1979): Journal of Marriage and the Family 41:75–88] for themselves and their partner, and measures of fear and injuries resulting from partner violence. I beliefs predicted self‐reported physical aggression to the partner, most CTS acts of physical aggression, and injuries to the partner, with only minor and limited associations for E beliefs. Correlations for the student and prisoner samples, and for men and women, showed different strengths.

The results showed that, compared with girls, boys reported a more frequent use of physical and verbal aggression. However, for indirect aggression no differences were found between boys and girls. A specific examination of sex differences on individual items of the DIAS showed that boys used physical, verbal and indirect aggression more often than girls. The findings also indicated that, as expected, adolescents in lower courses (14-15 years old) rated higher in all types of violence than adolescents in higher courses (16-17 years old). Also, we found that boys used physical and verbal aggression more often than girls did in all age groups studied. This study provided a better understanding of female aggression in the Spanish context and it enhanced our understanding of how aggression is expressed by Spanish girls. Aggr.

About a week following the end of the exposure phase, subjects participated in what they believed to be a totally unrelated experiment in which aggression was assessed within a Buss paradigm. Exposure to the violent or nonviolent pornographic stimuli was not found to affect laboratory aggression.

Longitudinal data from a racially diverse sample of middle‐school students were analyzed to explore how academic self‐concept influenced the likelihood of aggressing at school and whether high self‐concept exerted a different pattern of influence when threatened. Data include self‐reported academic self‐concept, school‐reported academic performance, and parent‐reported school discipline. Results suggest that, in general, students with low self‐concept in achievement domains are more likely to aggress at school than those with high self‐concept. However, there is a small sample of youth who, when they receive contradictory information that threatens their reported self‐concept, do aggress. Global self‐esteem was not found to be predictive of aggression. These results are discussed in the context of recent debates on whether self‐esteem is a predictor of aggression and the use of a more proximal vs. general self‐measure in examining the self‐esteem and aggression relation.

It is unclear, however, what factors may mitigate this relationship. This study tested the relationship of CV victimization to aggressive behavior, and the roles of coping style and perceived social support in moderating that relationship. Five hundred and fifteen 18–22-year-old men and women completed self-report inventories on CV exposure, aggressive behavior, perceived support from family and friends, and coping strategies. From a prior study, factor analysis of the coping scales yielded three factors of (1) disengagement (i.e., using primarily avoidant strategies), (2) interpersonal (i.e., using primarily emotion-focused strategies) and (3) problem-focused (i.e., using primarily active/approach strategies) coping styles. Results indicated that high CV victimization, high disengagement (i.e., avoidant) and interpersonal (i.e., emotion-focused) coping styles, and low perceived support from friends significantly predicted increased aggression scores. Significant moderating effects indicated that, as CV victimization increased in frequency, aggression scores were highest for those with low perceived friend support and high use of disengagement coping. Findings suggest that avoidant and emotion-focused coping styles are risk factors, and perceived support from friends is a protective factor, for a putative \"cycle of violence.\" Aggr.

Early elementary school predictors of trajectory group membership were examined as well as whether trajectory group predicted physical aggression, covert delinquency, and substance use in 9th grade. Semiparametric group modeling identified aggression behavior trajectory groups. We identified four aggression trajectory groups for both genders described as “not involved,” “low,” “moderate,” and “high.” Attention problems, family conflict, and low school commitment and attachment were predictors of membership in higher aggression groups for both boys and girls. Low family involvement and low parental education predicted membership in higher aggression groups for boys; while depression, low‐income status, and having a single parent predicted higher aggression group membership for girls. For both boys and girls, few risk predictors distinguished between the moderate and high aggression trajectories except that low school commitment and having a teen mother were significant predictors of being in the high group for girls, and low parental education and income were significant predictors of being in the high group for boys. Membership in the higher aggression trajectory groups predicted involvement in violent behaviors, covert delinquency, and substance use in 9th grade. Findings suggest that children who display an early trajectory of high levels of aggressive behavior are more likely to continue involvement in later problem behaviors. Second‐grade predictors suggest commonality of risk across genders and provide evidence of modifiable targets for preventive interventions. Aggr. Behav. 32:1–15. 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Results showed five latent classes. Consistent with previous research, LCA identified latent classes of victims, aggressors, and socially adjusted students. However, rather than a single aggressive‐victim subgroup, LCA identified latent classes of highly‐victimized aggressive‐victims and highly‐aggressive aggressive‐victims. Comparisons showed differences in mean profiles and classification criteria between LCA and traditional dichotomization approaches. Adjustment outcomes showed that highly‐victimized aggressive‐victims generally experienced greater negative psychological and social adjustment outcomes than highly‐aggressive aggressive‐victims.

The psychopathic personality represents a constellation of personality traits, which may be relevant to the differentiation of batterers from other offenders. In a sample of 172 county jail inmates, we examined whether antisocial batterers can be distinguished from the larger pool of antisocial offenders on the basis of the four‐facet model of psychopathy identified for the Psychopathy Checklist‐Revised (PCL‐R). Batterer/non‐batterer status was positively related to the PCL‐R affective facet and negatively related to the lifestyle facet, but there was no significant relationship between PCL‐R total scores and this criterion. Results suggest that antisocial batterers are characterized by deficient affective experience and by reduced impulsivity and irresponsibility compared with other antisocial offenders.

Male offenders who were sexually abused as a child are more likely to commit sexual offenses, particularly sexual offenses against children, than nonsexual offenses. Offenders who were physically abused are more likely to engage in violent offenses than nonviolent offenses.

In the second experiment, childhood histories of parents of children seen at a psychiatric clinic were assessed. The data indicated an association between severely punitive backgrounds of parents and the probability that the referred child had been physically abused. Also, the punishment histories of the parents were associated with the presence of antisocial and aggressive presenting problems displayed by the referred child.

The concepts of automaticity and impulsivity are discussed briefly and it is proposed that many impulsive actions, particularly antisocial ones, are due to failures of restraint after they were initiated involuntarily. A number of experiments are reviewed in which situational stimuli automatically instigated or heightened aggressive inclinations. These have to do with associations in hostility displacement, reactions to stigmatized persons, and association in aggressive reactions to media violence. The last‐mentioned studies deal especially with factors affecting the selection of the target for aggression. In discussing these findings it is suggested that after the crucial situational features had automatically initiated the sequence of determinants, the aggression displayed could have been due either to a hostile appraisal of the target or the activation of aggression‐related bodily reactions as well as hostile ideas. It is also hypothesized that in at least one of the studies, an experienced negative affect might have instigated the aggression independently of any appraisals. Aggr.

Montanus , was compared to that of laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus . Play in rats appears more complex for two reasons: 1) more of the playful contacts elicit defensive behaviors, and 2) more of these defenses lead to counterattacks, and hence, role reversals between attackers and defenders. Neither high levels of defense, as shown by montane voles, nor high levels of counterattack, as shown by prairie voles, produce rat‐like play‐fighting. This only occurs when high rates of defense involving turning to face the attacker and counterattack are combined, as in rats. These two components are rarely combined together by deer mice, and so this species rarely exhibits rat‐like play‐fighting. Furthermore, playful counterattack appears to arise from playful attack, and not from an escalation of defense. These data suggest that the more complex forms of social play, such as play‐fighting, have evolved, in part, via the escalation of defense in response to playful attack.",

    "abstract": "Fights were observed between young, unacquainted, domestic pigs. These fights were described in terms of the frequency of bites and the time spent in each of five spatial configurations of the animals. Depending on the rate that bites were given or received, each spatial configuration was characterized as resulting from offence or defence by one of the pigs. Bites were mainly directed at the head and ears, and defensive moves placed these areas out of reach. The most effective offensive move was an attack from the side. Pigs that lost fights tended to turn away from such attacks: winners were as likely to turn towards the attacker. Whether turning away is submission or simply defence is not clear. Factor analysis showed that fights could be described on three dimensions: offence by the loser along with mutual offence and mutual defence: offence by the winner and defence by the loser: and defence by the winner. Long fights involved much offence by the loser and defence by the winner: short fights involved much defence by the loser. When the pigs met again after 24 h, the fights were shorter and involved less offence and more defence by the loser. The transitions between the configurations reflect a balance of offence and defence by the pig responsible making for the transition. This balance is, in turn, affected by attacks from the opponent, fatigue, and the pig's assessment of its relative fighting ability. Retaliation against attacks is partly responsible for the persistence of fighting.",

This study aimed at: (1) verifying the presence in preschoolers of two additional participant roles (Consoler and Mediator), besides the six traditional roles detected by Salmivalli et al. [1996], grouped in four latent macroroles, by means of teacher report version of the Eight Participant Roles Questionnaire (PRQ) [Belacchi, 2008]; (2) linking prosocial and hostile behaviors to age and gender; and (3) investigating the relationship between roles and emotion understanding. Two hundred and nineteen children (54% boys; aged 3-6 years: mean age 4;10) were administered the Italian version of the Test of Emotion Comprehension [Albanese and Molina, 2008]; 20 teachers (2 for each class) filled in the questionnaire, attributing frequency scores on 24 items (3 for each role) to each pupil. A confirmatory analysis supported the fit of the hetero-report version of the Eight PRQ, revealing four macroroles: Hostile Roles (Bully, Reinforcer and Assistant), Prosocial Roles (Defender, Consoler, and Mediator), Victim, and Outsider. Satisfactory interteachers agreement not only confirms the macroroles hypothized, but also their expected distribution for gender and age. Moreover, the Prosocial roles presented a significant positive correlation with all subdimensions of emotion comprehension (External, Mental, and Reflective). The Victim and Outsider roles negatively correlated only with the External subdimension. The implications of these results for prevention and intervention purposes are discussed.",

Study 1, a correlational study, found that hostile masculinity predicts self‐reported sexual aggression independently of nonsexual aggression against women, and is itself predicted by proneness to general hostility, masculine gender role stress, and violent attitudes toward women. Furthermore, hostility toward women independently predicted sexual and nonsexual aggression against women, above the effects of general attitudes toward violence and general levels of hostility and aggression. Study 2, an experimental study, found that under high provocation, high hostility toward women predicted increases in male nonsexual aggression against women and slight decreases in male aggression against men. This effect remained significant even after controlling for general attitudes toward violence and for general levels of hostility and aggression, indicating that males who are highly hostile toward women specifically target women and that their aggression toward women generalizes beyond sexual aggression.

In the primary sample, significant developmental trends were detected in the teacher ratings with increasing gender differentiation as children grew older. Few gender differences were observed in the high-aggressive subgroup, but the aggressive and the matched control groups differed on virtually all comparisons. Gender differences in predictability were a function of risk status, with high-aggressive girls showing as much stability as high-aggressive boys.",

To date, there exists little information attesting to the reliability and validity of the SAVRY, and few investigations of the SAVRY's utility across gender. This study investigated the SAVRY in a sample of 144 high-risk adolescents (80 males and 64 females), focusing on gender discrepancies in the predictive utility of the measure. Results indicate that the SAVRY moderately predicts violent and non-violent reoffending in the entire sample, and also suggest that the SAVRY operates comparably across gender. Although not precluding the existence of gender-specific domains of risk, current results suggest that validated risk factors in boys hold relevance for the prediction of violence and delinquency in girls.",

Men who used manipulation or force were compared to each other and to men who engaged in only consensual sex. Participants were college men drawn from the first wave of a 5‐year longitudinal study. Stepwise discriminant function analyses, univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA), and χ 2 analyses tested group differences. As predicted, men who used force reported more childhood sexual abuse, witnessed more domestic violence, were more accepting of male violence, and were less likely to endorse love as a motive for sex than men in both the manipulation and consent groups. Men in the force group were also more likely to have had a casual relationship with the woman, and to be drinking and also intoxicated during the coercive incident than men in the manipulation group. Hypothesized differences between men who used force and manipulation regarding parental physical punishment, traditional gender role attitudes, delinquency, hedonistic and dominance motives for sex, prior sexual contact, and the length of the relationship were not supported. The results suggest that types of tactic used in sexual assaults can be distinguished on the basis of person and situational variables and that knowledge of these differences can facilitate future research, as well as rape deterrent and intervention programs.

    "abstract": "Abstract This article investigates the usefulness of Reintegrative Shaming Theory (RST) in explaining the bullying of siblings in families and peers in schools. Questionnaires were completed by 182 children aged 11–12 years in ten primary schools in Nicosia, Cyprus, about sibling and peer bullying. A vignette‐based methodology was used to investigate children's expectations of the type of shaming their parents would offer in response to their possible wrong doing. Children were also asked questions about the emotions they would have felt (i.e. shame, remorse, guilt or anger) if they were in the position of the child in the vignette. The level of bonding toward each parent was also examined. In agreement with the theory, a path analysis showed that mother bonding influenced children's expectations of the type of shaming offered by parents. Disintegrative shaming (i.e. shaming offered in a stigmatizing or rejecting way) had a direct effect on the way children managed their shame. Shame management directly influenced sibling and peer bullying. Father bonding had no direct or indirect effects in the model. Against the theory, reintegrative shaming (i.e. shaming offered in the context of approving the wrongdoer while rejecting the wrongdoing) did not have a direct effect on shame management. Beyond the postulates of RST, mother bonding—a plausible indicator of family functioning—had a direct effect on sibling and peer bullying. Mother bonding had a stronger effect for boys than for girls. It is concluded that RST is useful in explaining the link between family factors and bullying, and that RST has cross‐cultural applicability. Aggr. Behav. 34:352–368, 2008. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

A total of 58 college students were randomly assigned to the inclusion or ostracism conditions of C yberball, a virtual ball‐tossing game. Immediately following the experimental manipulation, ostracized participants reported more thwarted psychological need states, more negative mood, and fewer positive ruminative thoughts, relative to their included counterparts. Ostracized participants reported a greater interest in affiliating with others in online or in‐person settings. In the short‐term, ostracized males reported more hostility than included males, although the scores were within expected norms for most males. There was no relation between Cyberball condition and gender across time for depression, anxiety, or positive affect. Approximately 20 min after the onset of the stressor, women in the luteal phase and women taking oral contraceptives in the ostracized group displayed higher cortisol than their counterparts in the included group. Relative to baseline, however, cortisol did not reliably increase after the onset of the stressor. Ostracized females taking oral contraceptives showed the greatest decline in cortisol, compared to included oral contraceptive users. Overall, results suggest that most of the negative effects of ostracism are immediate and limited to psychological, not neuroendocrine, responses.",

The randomized multimodal preventive intervention targeted a subsample of boys rated disruptive by their teachers. These boys were initially part of a sample of 895 boys, followed from kindergarten to 17 years of age. Semiparametric analyses of developmental trajectories for self‐reported proactive and reactive aggression (between 13 and 17 years of age) indicated three trajectories for each type of aggression that varied in size and shape (Low, Moderate, and High Peaking). Intent‐to‐treat comparisons between the boys in the prevention group and the control group confirmed that the preventive intervention between 7 and 9 years of age, which included parenting skills and social skills training, could impact the development of reactive more than proactive aggression. The intervention effect identified in reactive aggression was related to a reduction in self‐reported coercive parenting. The importance of these results for the distinction between subtypes of aggressive behaviors and the value of longitudinal‐experimental studies from early childhood onward is discussed. Aggr.

    "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between countries' dominant cultural values (i.e., individualism and collectivism) and (a) school principals' perceptions of aggressive student behavior and (b) students' self-reports of being aggressively victimized in school. Data on student aggression and victimization were collected across 62 countries in nationally representative samples of fourth and eighth graders (N = 428,566) and their principals (N = 15,043) by the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2007. Students were asked about three forms of aggressive victimization: physical, verbal, and relational; principals about two forms of aggressive student behavior: physical and verbal. Country-level regression analyses revealed that the level of cultural individualism, according to the individualism index (IDV) by Hofstede, Hofstede, and Minkov (2010), was not significantly related to either form of student-reported victimization. However, school principals reported aggressive student behavior more often the more individualist, and hence less collectivist, their country's culture. This relation was evident in the principals' reports on 4th and 8th grade students' aggressive behavior for both physical and verbal aggression. Multilevel analyses revealed that cultural individualism was still a powerful predictor of principal-reported aggressive student behavior after controlling for school and country characteristics. The discussion outlines reasons why principals' reports of aggressive student behavior are probably more valid indicators of student aggression than student self-reports of victimization, thereby supporting the hypothesis of culture-dependency of aggression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although numerous investigations of overt aggressive and antisocial trajectories have been undertaken, there is a dearth of literature examining gender differences and similarities in trajectory patterns and their correlates. To address these gaps, we investigated gender differences in the prevalence rates, predictive validity during transition to adulthood, childhood risk factors, and adolescent correlates of different trajectories of teacher‐reported overt aggression (i.e., fights, argues, gets in trouble) among 220 participants (116 girls and 104 boys) evaluated annually from grade 4 to grade 12. Four patterns of trajectories were identified: low, increasing (i.e., adolescent‐onset), decreasing (i.e., childhood‐limited), and high (i.e., childhood‐onset). A large proportion of youth, particularly girls, displayed low levels of aggression over time. A small proportion followed the childhood‐onset trajectory. Across gender, the childhood‐onset trajectory was associated with the highest rates of maladjustment during the transition to adulthood, the highest number of childhood risk factors, and multiple problems during adolescence. The adolescent‐onset trajectory was associated with few childhood risk factors, but with high levels of independent status during adolescence. In contrast, the childhood‐limited trajectory was associated with several childhood risk factors, but high levels of parental monitoring and school engagement during adolescence. Romantic involvement differentiated the adolescent‐onset and childhood‐limited trajectories among girls. Aggr. Behav. Aggr. Behav. 37:387–404, 2011. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Prior research has shown that (1) better knowledge about the consequences of rape goes along with less rape‐supportive attitudes and lower rape proclivity, and (2) empathy with the victims correlates negatively with sexual aggression. In two experiments, the authors combined these approaches in order to reduce sexual harassment myth acceptance (SHMA) and the likelihood to sexually harass (LSH). In Study 1, 101 male and female university students read a report describing sexual harassment as either serious or harmless, and completed scales assessing dispositional empathy and SHMA. Results showed that higher empathy was associated with lower SHMA; furthermore, learning about the seriousness (vs. harmlessness) of sexual harassment led to lower SHMA, particularly in participants low in empathy. Gender differences in SHMA were fully explained by gender differences in empathy. In Study 2, perspective taking, a crucial aspect of empathy, was manipulated. One hundred nineteen male and female participants read either a neutral text or a description of a sexual harassment case, which was written either from the female target's or from the male perpetrator's perspective; then they completed scales measuring SHMA and (only male participants) LSH. The target's perspective led to lower SHMA and to lower LSH than did the neutral text, whereas no such effect was found for the perpetrator's perspective.

    "abstract": "Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) in DSM‐5 represents a disorder of recurrent, problematic, reactive (i.e., affective or impulsive), aggressive behavior that, over the lifetime, affects about 5–6% of individuals in the United States. While aggression is also observed in those with psychopathic personality, aggression in this context is frequently proactive rather than reactive, and neurobiological study suggests important differences between those with proactive aggression/psychopathy and those with reactive aggression. In this paper, we conducted two sets of analyses. First, a phenomenologic study to explore the frequency of psychopathic personality defined by the Psychopathology Checklist‐Screening Version (PCL‐SV) among IED and comparator participants and to explore differences in measures of aggression, anger, and impulsivity as a function of IED and psychopathic personality. Second, we re‐analyzed data from five published studies to determine if psychopathic personality accounted for differences between IED and comparator participants. The first study found that only a modest proportion of IED participants display clinically substantial features of psychopathy and that measures of trait aggression and anger, rather than those of psychopathy, are the strongest correlates of IED. The second study found little evidence for any impact of psychopathy on reported findings in IED compared with various control participants. Aggr.

Self‐report questionnaires were used to assess affective empathy, perceived support from parents, delinquency, and aggression. Guided by theories on children's differential susceptibility to socialization, we expected adolescents with different levels of empathy to vary in their responsiveness to parental support. In agreement with our hypothesis, empathy moderated the relation of perceived parental support with aggressive and delinquent behavior. Controlling for the effect of gender and for the stability of aggression and delinquency, higher perceived parental support was predictive of lower levels of aggression at age 15, but only for adolescents high in empathy. Remarkably, adolescents low in empathy not only appeared to benefit less from parental support, but even showed more aggression and delinquency at age 15 when they perceived their parents to be more supportive at age 14.

    "abstract": "Abstract Children who are clumsy are often bullied. Nevertheless, motor skills have been overlooked in research on bullying victimization. A total of 2,730 Swedish adults (83% females) responded to retrospective questions on bullying, their talents in physical education (i.e., coordination and balls skills) and school academics. Poor talents were used as indicators of poor gross motor skills and poor academic skills. A subset of participants also provided information on educational level in adulthood, childhood obesity, belonging to an ethic minority in school and socioeconomic status relative to schoolmates. A total of 29.4% of adults reported being bullied in school, and 18.4% reported having below average gross motor skills. Of those with below average motor skills, 48.6% were bullied in school. Below average motor skills in childhood were associated with an increased risk (OR 3.01 [95% CI: 1.97–4.60]) of being bullied, even after adjusting for the influence of lower socioeconomic status, poor academic performance, being overweight, and being a bully. Higher odds for bully victimization were also associated with lower socioeconomic status (OR 2.29 [95% CI: 1.45–3.63]), being overweight (OR 1.71 [95% CI: 1.18–2.47]) and being a bully (OR 2.18 [95% CI: 1.53–3.11]). The findings indicate that poor gross motor skills constitute a robust risk‐marker for vulnerability for bully victimization. Aggr. Behav. 39:453–461, 2013. © 2013 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Despite evidence documenting the negative consequences, psychological dating violence occurs frequently in adolescent dating relationships. No information exists on the trajectories that adolescents follow and their association to nonphysical peer violence. The sample comprised 624 randomly selected 6th graders. In yearly surveys from 6th through 12th grade, 550 of the 624 students reported dating at least twice during the 3 months prior to completing the survey. These students responded to questions about frequency of engagement in psychological dating violence perpetration and victimization. We used Proc TRAJ to identify developmental trajectories of behavior over time and generalized estimating equation models to examine the associations of the trajectories and peer aggression. Adolescents followed three distinct developmental trajectories related to psychological dating violence victimization and perpetration: low, increasing, and high. Based on the joint probabilities of victimization and perpetration, we identified four predominant groups: low victimization/low perpetration (LVLP; 36%), increasing victimization/increasing perpetration (40%), high victimization/high perpetration (HVHP; 15%), and increasing victimization/low perpetration (IVLP; 7%). The LVLP had significantly more boys and White students; the HVHP group had an even gender distribution and more African‐American students. For all groups, peer aggression decreased from Grade 6 to 12; students in the HVHP group reported the highest peer aggression, and students in the LVLP reported the lowest peer aggression. Findings suggest a strong, reciprocal relationship in the developmental trajectories of adolescents who experience and perpetrate psychological dating violence. Those highly engaged in these behaviors were also more likely to be violent toward peers. Aggr. Behav. 38:510‐520, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Caregiver reports were collected for 1,087 youth (48.9% male) ages 6–18. Results indicated that all three subfactors of ASB demonstrated substantial loadings on a general ASB factor. Using a bifactor model approach, specific factors representing each ASB subfactor were simultaneously modeled, allowing for examination of common and specific correlates. At the scale level, results demonstrated consistently strong connections with high Neuroticism and low Agreeableness across all 3 ASB subfactors, a pattern which was replicated for the general ASB factor in the bifactor approach. Specific factors in the bifactor model demonstrated connections with personality and psychopathology correlates, primarily for Agg. These findings provide some support for an overall grouping of RAgg with other ASB subfactors in youth, and further distinguish Agg as potentially representing a more potent variant of youth ASB relative to both RB and RAgg.

    "abstract": "Cyberbullying is an emerging form of bullying that takes place through contemporary information and communication technologies. Building on past research on the psychosocial risk factors for cyberbullying in this age group, the present study assessed a theory‐driven, school‐based preventive intervention that targeted moral disengagement, empathy and social cognitive predictors of cyberbullying. Adolescents (N = 355) aged between 16 and 18 years were randomly assigned into the intervention and the control group. Both groups completed anonymous structured questionnaires about demographics, empathy, moral disengagement and cyberbullying‐related social cognitive variables (attitudes, actor prototypes, social norms, and behavioral expectations) before the intervention, post‐intervention and 6 months after the intervention. The intervention included awareness‐raising and interactive discussions about cyberbullying with intervention group students. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that, after controlling for baseline measurements, there were significant differences at post‐intervention measures in moral disengagement scores, and in favorability of actor prototypes. Further analysis on the specific mechanisms of moral disengagement showed that significant differences were observed in distortion of consequences and attribution of blame. The implications of the intervention are discussed, and guidelines for future school‐based interventions against cyberbullying are provided. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Environmental enrichment (EE) is an experimental paradigm in which rodents are housed in complex environments containing objects that provide stimulation, the effects of which are expected to improve the welfare of these subjects. EE has been shown to considerably improve learning and memory in rodents. However, knowledge about the effects of EE on social interaction is generally limited and rather controversial. Thus, our aim was to evaluate both novel object recognition and agonistic behavior in NMRI mice receiving EE, hypothesizing enhanced cognition and slightly enhanced agonistic interaction upon EE rearing. During a 4‐week period half the mice ( n = 16) were exposed to EE and the other half ( n = 16) remained in a standard environment (SE). On PND 56–57, animals performed the object recognition test, in which recognition memory was measured using a discrimination index. The social interaction test consisted of an encounter between an experimental animal and a standard opponent. Results indicated that EE mice explored the new object for longer periods than SE animals ( P &lt; .05). During social encounters, EE mice devoted more time to sociability and agonistic behavior ( P &lt; .05) than their non‐EE counterparts. In conclusion, EE has been shown to improve object recognition and increase agonistic behavior in adolescent/early adulthood mice. In the future we intend to extend this study on a longitudinal basis in order to assess in more depth the effect of EE and the consistency of the above‐mentioned observations in NMRI mice. Aggr.

Through a media preference survey, men then learned that their female partner disliked sexual content in films, after which they had an opportunity to send her up to 120 sec' worth of either a sexually explicit or nonsexual film clip. Validating the online sexual aggression paradigm, men with a 1-year history of sexual assault exhibited more sexually aggressive responding during the film selection paradigm. Moreover, exposure to injunctive norm information produced a boomerang effect, such that men high in hostile sexist attitudes showed an increase in sexual aggression when confronted with paternalism and gender equality norms. Conversely, exposure to paternalism and gender equality norms suppressed the otherwise protective function of high benevolent sexism in reducing men's sexually aggressive tendencies. The implications of these results for social norms interventions are discussed.",

The present investigation was carried out in 2011, 28 years after the law was adopted. Changes in exposure to various types of physical punishment towards respondents born between 1931 and 1996 are presented. A representative sample from Western Finland, consisting of 4,609 respondents (2,632 females, 1,977 males) between 15 and 80 years, filled in a paper‐and‐pencil questionnaire. A number of psychosocial concomitants were measured. The results showed a significant drop in reports of being slapped and beaten with an object among respondents who were born after the law was adopted. The decline in physical punishment was associated with a similar decline in the number of murdered children. Respondents who had been exposed to higher amounts of physical punishment than average scored significantly higher on alcohol abuse, depression, mental health problems, and schizotypal personality. Divorced respondents had been significantly more physically punished than others. Respondents who had attempted suicide during the last 12 months had been exposed to physical punishment during childhood significantly more often than those who had not attempted suicide. Aggr.

We report an association study between COMT single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), childhood aggression, and the CU trait in our sample of 144 children with scores at or exceeding the 90th percentile on the aggression subscale of the parent‐reported Child Behavior Checklist and the Teacher's Report Form. The genotype analysis of rs6269 showed nominally significant association ( P = .019) and rs4818 showed a trend ( P = .064) with COA. Trends were observed for rs6269 and rs4818 with CU scores ( P &lt; .10) as well. The analyses stratified by ADHD, or gender showed no significant results. This is the first report to our knowledge evaluating COMT SNPs with the phenotype of high aggression in children with a possible role for the COMT marker in CU traits. Given the importance of CU traits in antisocial behavior, further investigation of COMT is warranted. Aggr. Behav. 39:45‐51, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Latent transition analysis was used to establish classes of bullying, victimization, bully‐victimization, and uninvolvement. The intervention had a positive impact on children as they moved from elementary to middle school. More students in the YM group transitioned from the involved statuses to the uninvolved status than students in the control group during the move to middle school. Elementary school bullies with higher levels of depressive symptoms were less likely than other students to move to an uninvolved status in the first year of middle school. Students who held greater antisocial attitudes were more likely to be a member of the bully‐victim status than the uninvolved status during the move to middle school. Perspective‐taking empathy, however, was not a significant predictor of status change during the transition to middle school. Implications for school‐based prevention programs during the move to middle school are noted. Aggr. Behav. 40:24–41, 2014. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Although experts agree that intimate partner violence (IPV) is a multidimensional phenomenon comprised of both physical and non‐physical acts, there is no measure of legal and administrative (LA) forms of IPV. LA aggression is when one partner manipulates the legal and other administrative systems to the detriment of his/her partner. Our measure was developed using the qualitative literature on male IPV victims' experiences. We tested the reliability and validity of our LA aggression measure on two samples of men: 611 men who sustained IPV and sought help, and 1,601 men in a population‐based sample. Construct validity of the victimization scale was supported through factor analyses, correlations with other forms of IPV victimization, and comparisons of the rates of LA aggression between the two samples; reliability was established through Cronbach's alpha. Evidence for the validity and reliability of the perpetration scale was mixed and therefore needs further analyses and revisions before we can recommend its use in empirical work. There is initial support for the victimization scale as a valid and reliable measure of LA aggression victimization among men, but work is needed using women's victimization's experiences to establish reliability and validity of this measure for women. An LA aggression measure should be developed using LGBTQ victims' experiences, and for couples who are well into the divorce and child custody legal process. Legal personnel and practitioners should be educated on this form of IPV so that they can appropriately work with clients who have been victimized or perpetrate LA aggression. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Sexual harassment represents aggressive behavior that is often enacted instrumentally, in response to a threatened sense of masculinity and male identity. To date, however, theoretical attention to the social cognitive processes that regulate workplace harassment is scant. This article presents the development and preliminary validation of the Moral Disengagement in Sexual Harassment Scale (MDiSH); a self‐report measure of moral disengagement in the context of hostile work environment harassment. Three studies (total n = 797) document the excellent psychometric properties of this new scale. Male U.K. university students (Study 1: n = 322) and U.S. working males (Studies 2 and 3: n = 475) completed the MDiSH and an array of measures for construct validation. The MDiSH exhibited positive correlations with sexual harassment myth acceptance, male gender identification, and hostile sexism. In Study 3, participants were exposed to a fictitious case of hostile work environment harassment. The MDiSH attenuated moral judgment, negative emotions (guilt, shame, and anger), sympathy, and endorsement of prosocial behavioral intentions (support for restitution) associated with the harassment case. Conversely, the MDiSH increased positive affect (happiness) about the harassment and attribution of blame to the female complainant. Implications for practice and future research avenues are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 42:254–273, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Some children who bully others are also victimized themselves (“bully‐victims”) whereas others are not victimized themselves (“bullies”). These subgroups have been shown to differ in their social functioning as early as in kindergarten. What is less clear are the motives that underlie the bullying behavior of young bullies and bully‐victims. The present study examined whether bullies have proactive motives for aggression and anticipate to feel happy after victimizing others, whereas bully‐victims have reactive motives for aggression, poor theory of mind skills, and attribute hostile intent to others. This “distinct processes hypothesis” was contrasted with the “shared processes hypothesis,” predicting that bullies and bully‐victims do not differ on these psychological processes. Children ( n = 283, age 4–9) were classified as bully, bully‐victim, or noninvolved using peer‐nominations. Theory of mind, hostile intent attributions, and happy victimizer emotions were assessed using standard vignettes and false‐belief tasks; reactive and proactive motives were assessed using teacher‐reports. We tested our hypotheses using Bayesian model selection, enabling us to directly compare the distinct processes model (predicting that bullies and bully‐victims deviate from noninvolved children on different psychological processes) against the shared processes model (predicting that bullies and bully‐victims deviate from noninvolved children on all psychological processes alike). Overall, the shared processes model received more support than the distinct processes model. These results suggest that in early childhood, bullies and bully‐victims have shared, rather than distinct psychological processes underlying their bullying behavior.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms by which early risk factors for social maladjustment contribute to disruptive behaviors in social settings is vital to developmental research and practice. A major risk factor for social maladjustment is early exposure to violence, which was examined in this short‐term longitudinal study in relation to social information processing (SIP) patterns and externalizing and internalizing behaviors in a sample of 256 preschool children. Data on exposure to violence were obtained via parent report, data on SIP were obtained via child interview, and data on child problem behavior were obtained via teacher report. Findings supported the hypothesis that, compared to children not exposed to violence, children reported to witness and/or experience violence are more likely to attribute hostile intent to peers, generate aggressive responses, and evaluate socially unaccepted responses (aggressive and inept) as socially suitable. The former were also found to exhibit higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Finally, SIP mediated the link between exposure to violence and problem behavior thus supporting this study's general approach, which argues that the link between exposure to violence and children's problem behaviors are better understood within the context of their perceptions about social relationships.

In addition, the link between dehumanization and moral disengagement in bullying and victimization was investigated. Participants were 800 children (7–12 years old) from third to fifth grade classrooms. Subtle animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization toward friends and non‐friends were measured with the new Juvenile Dehumanization Measure. Results showed that animalistic dehumanization was more common than mechanistic dehumanization and that non‐friends were dehumanized more than friends. The highest levels of dehumanization were found in animalistic form toward non‐friends and the lowest levels in mechanistic form toward friends. Both moral disengagement and animalistic dehumanization toward friends were positively associated with bullying. However, moral disengagement was negatively associated with victimization, whereas both animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization toward non‐friends were positively associated with victimization. The current findings indicate that children are able to distinguish different forms and targets of dehumanization and that dehumanization plays a distinct role from moral disengagement in bullying and victimization.

The study involved a sample of 26,232 students (53.4% females; mean age = 14.62, SD = 1.69) participating in the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS), a survey investigating a wide range of youth health and risk behaviors administered in all California schools every 2 years. Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), findings indicated that high levels of empathy and parental support were associated with a lower likelihood of affiliating with a gang. Associating with deviant peers and perceiving the school as unsafe were positively correlated with gang membership. At the school level, lack of safety and type of school (special education, vocational, or alternative school vs. comprehensive schools) were associated with greater probability of gang membership. Empathy mitigated the association between deviant peers and gang membership.",

In the present study, we tested the association between childhood maltreatment and adolescent aggression in boys in juvenile justice facilities ( N = 767) and examined the contribution of mental health problems to this relationship. Data on childhood maltreatment, mental health problems, and aggression were collected by means of self‐report measures and structural equation models were used to test mediation models. We found that mental health problems mediated the link between maltreatment and aggression. Results demonstrated different pathways depending on the type of aggression examined. The association between childhood maltreatment and reactive aggression was fully mediated by a variety of mental health problems and for proactive aggression the association was partially mediated by mental health problems. We also found that reactive and proactive aggression partially mediated the association between maltreatment and mental health problems. These findings suggest that a transactional model may best explain the negative effects of childhood trauma on mental health problems and (in particular reactive) aggression. In addition, our findings add to the existing evidence that reactive and proactive aggression have different etiological pathways. Aggr. Behav. 41:488–501, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The selective advantage of male infanticide is enhancement of reproductive success of the aggressor. This implies that aggression is directed at individuals sired by others, infant loss shortens the mother's inter‐birth interval, and the aggressor has a greater likelihood of siring the next offspring of the victims’ mother. As these conditions are not always met, the occurrence of male infanticide is expected to vary, and hominoid primates offer an interesting example of variation in male infanticide. Infanticide has been reported in gorillas and chimpanzees but appears to be absent in orangutans and bonobos. One argument for the absence of infanticide in bonobos is reduction of male aggression. However, given that male aggression against immature individuals occurs and that females engage in behavior that is considered to be counterstrategy against male infanticide, the risk of male infanticide may pose a potential threat. Here, we explored whether aggression by male bonobos fits predictions of male infanticide. Male aggression toward immature individuals was rare and did not have lethal consequences, but the majority of observed cases exposed targets to risks of injury. Males did not target their own offspring less frequently than unrelated immatures, and the risk of being the target of male aggression increased with the targets’ age. Overall, these results do not match the predictions of the adaptive male infanticide hypothesis. Instead, aggression by males may promote the emigration of the targets and older males may reinforce their superior status toward individuals that will soon compete for the same resources.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in justice sensitivity and rejection sensitivity have been linked to differences in aggressive behavior in adults. However, there is little research studying this association in children and adolescents and considering the two constructs in combination. We assessed justice sensitivity from the victim, observer, and perpetrator perspective as well as anxious and angry rejection sensitivity and linked both constructs to different forms (physical, relational), and functions (proactive, reactive) of self‐reported aggression and to teacher‐ and parent‐rated aggression in N = 1,489 9‐ to 19‐year olds in Germany. Victim sensitivity and both angry and anxious rejection sensitivity showed positive correlations with all forms and functions of aggression. Angry rejection sensitivity also correlated positively with teacher‐rated aggression. Perpetrator sensitivity was negatively correlated with all aggression measures, and observer sensitivity also correlated negatively with all aggression measures except for a positive correlation with reactive aggression. Path models considering the sensitivity facets in combination and controlling for age and gender showed that higher victim justice sensitivity predicted higher aggression on all measures. Higher perpetrator sensitivity predicted lower physical, relational, proactive, and reactive aggression. Higher observer sensitivity predicted lower teacher‐rated aggression. Angry rejection sensitivity predicted higher proactive and reactive aggression, whereas anxious rejection sensitivity did not make an additional contribution to the prediction of aggression.

In contrast, findings regarding bullying perpetration are mixed, with some researchers claiming that bullies may have superior SIP abilities than victimized or uninvolved youth. This study investigated the effects of bullying and victimization on early SIP; specifically the recognition and interpretation of social information. In stage 1, 2,782 adolescents (11-16 years) were screened for bullying involvement, and in stage 2, 723 of these participants (mean age = 13.95) were assessed on measures of emotion recognition, hostile attribution bias, and characterological self-blame (CSB). No associations between bullying and early SIP were found. In contrast, victimization was associated with more hostile attribution bias and CSB attributions. Girls performed better than boys on the emotion recognition task while boys showed greater hostile attribution biases. No interaction effects of bullying or victimization with gender were found. Follow-up categorical analyses that considered pure victims versus victims who also bullied (bully-victims) on SIP, found a similar pattern of findings. These findings suggest that those who purely bully others are neither superior nor deficient in the early stages of SIP. Victimized adolescents, however, show biases in their interpretations of social situations and the intentions of others. These biases may lead to maladaptive responses and may increase risk for further victimization by peers.",

Furthermore, few studies have investigated factors that differentiate perpetrators who employ different forms of sexual assault tactics. The current study included 526 men who completed self-report inventories at the end of each of their four years in college. Measures assessed sexual assault tactics, demographics, incident characteristics, risky behavior, rape supportive beliefs and peer norms, antisocial traits, and childhood adversity. Perpetrators were grouped based on the most severe tactics reported over the course of 7 assessed time periods, with 13% in the verbal coercion group, 16% in the incapacitation group, and 5% in the forcible group. ANOVAs determined that the forcible group scored significantly higher than incapacitation and verbal coercion groups on risky behavior, rape supportive beliefs/norms, antisocial traits, and childhood adversity. The incapacitation group scored higher than the verbal coercion group on risky behavior. In a multinomial logistic regression analysis comparing tactic groups to non-perpetrators, all tactic groups scored significantly higher on risky behavior and rape supportive beliefs/norms, and the forcible group scored higher on antisocial traits and childhood adversity. Perpetrators in the forcible group had engaged in more repeat offenses, and perpetrators of both the incapacitated and forcible assaults were more likely to use alcohol before the incident. Findings highlight the need for interventions that are tailored to offense trajectories, alter rape supportive attitudes and peer norms, and decrease campus substance use. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Anger and aggression are among the most common issues reported by returning service members from combat deployments. However, the pathways between combat exposure and anger and aggression have not been comprehensively characterized. The present study aimed to characterize the relationship between trait anger, combat exposure, post‐deployment PTSD, and aggression. U.S. Army soldiers ( N = 2,420) were administered anonymous surveys assessing combat exposure, current PTSD symptoms and aggression, as well as trait anger items 3 months after returning from deployment to Afghanistan. PTSD symptom levels were related to aggression at higher levels of trait anger, but not evident among soldiers who had lower levels of trait anger. The pathway from combat exposure to PTSD, and then to aggression, was conditional upon levels of trait anger, such that the pathway was most evident at high levels of trait anger. This was the first study to our knowledge that concurrently modeled unconditional and conditional direct and indirect associations between combat exposure, PTSD, trait anger, and aggression. The findings can be helpful clinically and for developing screening protocols for combat exposed Soldiers. The results of this study suggest the importance of assessing and managing anger and aggression in soldiers returning from combat deployment. Anger is one of the most common complaints of returning soldiers and can have debilitating effects across all domains of functioning. It is imperative that future research efforts are directed toward understanding this phenomenon and developing and validating effective treatments for it. Aggr. Behav. 41:556–565, 2015.

    "abstract": "Approximately 25% of male college students report engaging in some form of sexual coercion by the end of their fourth year of college. White and Smith (2004) found that negative childhood experiences-childhood sexual abuse, childhood physical abuse, and witnessing domestic violence-predicted sexual aggression perpetrated before college, but not during the subsequent college years, a puzzling finding in view of the reasonably consistent rates of sexual aggression from adolescence to the first 2 years of college. The current study takes a person-centered approach to sexual aggression in an attempt to resolve this discrepancy. We examined the possibility of cohesive subgroups of men in terms of their frequency of sexual aggression across the pre-college and college years. A series of latent class growth models were fit to an existing longitudinal dataset of sexual experiences collected across four time points-pre-college through year 3 of college. A four-trajectory model fit the data well, exhibiting significantly better fit than a three-trajectory model. The four trajectories are interpreted as men who perpetrate sexual aggression at (1) low (71.5% of the sample), (2) moderate (21.2%), (3) decreasing (4.2%), and (4) increasing (3.1%) frequencies across time. Negative childhood experiences predicted membership of the decreasing trajectory, relative to the low trajectory, but did not predict membership of the increasing trajectory, explaining the discrepancy uncovered by White and Smith. Implications for primary prevention of sexual aggression are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The main aim of this study is to investigate the development of violence from childhood to adulthood. In the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD), 411 London males have been followed up from age 8 to 48 in interviews, and from age 10 to 61 in criminal records; 19% were convicted for violence. There was a surprising amount of violence committed at older ages (40–61). The number of violence convictions was similar at ages 10–20, 21–39, and 40–61. There was considerable continuity in violent offending from ages 10–20 to 40–61. There was also continuity in self‐reported violence from ages 15–18 to 43–48, and violence convictions were related to self‐reported violence at all ages. The most important childhood risk factors for violence convictions were high daring or risk‐taking, low verbal intelligence, a disrupted family, harsh parental discipline, high hyperactivity, and large family size. The extent to which these risk factors predicted violence at ages 40–61 was noteworthy. The “integrated cognitive antisocial potential (ICAP)” theory was proposed to explain the development of violence, and methods of preventing violence, targeting childhood risk factors, were reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Are individuals willing to intervene in public violence? Half a century of research on the “bystander effect” suggests that the more bystanders present at an emergency, the less likely each of them is to provide help. However, recent meta‐analytical evidence questions whether this effect generalizes to violent emergencies. Besides the number of bystanders present, an alternative line of research suggests that pre‐existing social relations between bystanders and conflict participants are important for explaining whether bystanders provide help. The current paper offers a rare comparison of both factors—social relations and the number of bystanders present—as predictors of bystander intervention in real‐life violent emergencies. We systematically observed the behavior of 764 bystanders across 81 violent incidents recorded by surveillance cameras in Copenhagen, Denmark. Bystanders were sampled with a case–control design, their behavior was observed and coded, and the probability of intervention was estimated with multilevel regression analyses. The results confirm our predicted association between social relations and intervention. However, rather than the expected reversed bystander effect, we found a classical bystander effect, as bystanders were less likely to intervene with increasing bystander presence. The effect of social relations on intervention was larger in magnitude than the effect of the number of bystanders. We assess these findings in light of recent discussions about the influence of group size and social relations in human helping. Further, we discuss the utility of video data for the assessment of real‐life bystander behavior.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with aggression regulation disorders tend to attribute hostility to others in socially ambiguous situations. Previous research suggests that this “hostile attribution bias” is a powerful cause of aggression. Facial expressions form important cues in the appreciation of others’ intentions. Furthermore, accurate processing of facial expressions is fundamental to normal socialization. However, research on interpretation biases in facial affect is limited. It is asserted that a hostile interpretation bias (HIB) is likely to be displayed by individuals with an antisocial (ASPD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) and probably also with an intermittent explosive disorder (IED). However, there is little knowledge to what extent this bias is displayed by each of these patient groups. The present study investigated whether a HIB regarding emotional facial expressions was displayed by forensic psychiatric outpatients (FPOs) and whether it was associated with ASPD and BPD in general or, more specifically, with a disposition to react with pathological aggression. Participants of five different groups were recruited: FPOs with ASPD, BPD, or IED, non‐forensic patients with BPD (nFPOs‐BPD), and healthy, non‐aggressive controls (HCs). Results suggest that solely FPOs with ASPD, BPD, or IED exhibit a HIB regarding emotional facial expressions. Moreover, this bias was associated with type and severity of aggression, trait aggression, and cognitive distortions. The results suggest that a HIB regarding facial expressions is an important characteristic of pathological aggressive behavior. Interventions that modify the HIB might help to reduce the recurrence of aggression. Aggr. Behav. 43:386–397, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Displaying markers of coalitional affiliation is a common feature of contemporary life. In situations in which interaction with members of rival coalitions is likely, signaling coalitional affiliation may simultaneously constitute an implicit challenge to opponents and an objective commitment device, binding signalers to their coalitions. Individuals who invite conflict, and who cannot readily back out of conflict, constitute a greater threat than those who avoid conflict and preserve the option of feigning neutrality. As a consequence, the former should be viewed as more formidable than the latter. Recent research indicates that relative formidability is summarized using the envisioned physical size and strength of a potential antagonist. Thus, individuals who display markers of coalitional affiliation should be conceptualized as more physically imposing than those who do not. We tested this prediction in two experiments. In Study 1, conducted with U.S. university students, participants inspected images of sports fans' faces. In Study 2, conducted with U.S. Mechanical Turk workers, participants read vignettes depicting political partisans. In both studies, participants estimated the physical formidability of the target individuals and reported their own ability to defend themselves; in Study 2, participants estimated the target's aggressiveness. Consonant with predictions, targets depicted as signaling coalitional affiliation in situations of potential conflict were envisioned to be more physically formidable and more aggressive than were those not depicted as signaling thusly. Underscoring that the calculations at issue concern the possibility of violent conflict, participants' estimates of the protagonist's features were inversely correlated with their ability to defend themselves.

    "abstract": "The aim of this research was to investigate the interplay between victim‐aggressor relationships and defending relationships in early childhood to test the proposition that young aggressors are less selective than older children in their choice of vulnerable targets. Cross‐sectional multivariate statistical social network analyses (Exponential Random Graph Models) for a sample of 177 preschoolers from seven classes, 5‐ to 7‐years‐old, revealed that boys were more aggressive than girls, toward both boys and girls, whereas defending relationships were most often same‐sex. There was significant reciprocity in aggression, indicating that it was more often bidirectional rather than unidirectional. In addition, aggressors clearly defended each other when they shared their targets of aggression, whereas a marginally significant trend appeared for defending between victims who were victimized by the same aggressors. Furthermore, teacher‐rated dominance was positively associated with children's involvement in both aggression and victimization, and teacher‐rated insecurity was associated with less aggression, but not with victimization. These findings suggest that those who are reported as being victimized may retaliate, or be aggressive themselves, and do not display some of the vulnerabilities reported among older groups of victims. The findings are in line with the proposition that young aggressors are less strategic than older children in targeting vulnerable victims. The network approach to peer victimization and defending contributes to understanding the social processes facilitating the development of aggression in early childhood.",

However, one under-researched area is the potential negative effects of sexualized video game content on players. This study analyzed the consequences of sexualized video game content on online sexual harassment against male and female targets. We controlled for a number of variables that might be related to online sexual harassment (i.e., trait aggressiveness, ambivalent sexism, online disinhibition). Participants (N = 211) played a video game with either sexualized or non-sexualized female characters. After gameplay, they had the opportunity to sexually harass a male or a female partner by sending them sexist jokes. Based on the General Aggression Model integrated with the Confluence Model of Sexual Aggression (Anderson & Anderson, ), we predicted that playing the game with sexualized female characters would increase sexual harassment against female targets. Results were consistent with these predictions. Sexual harassment levels toward a female partner were higher for participants who played the game with sexualized female characters than for participants who played the same game with non-sexualized female characters. These findings indicate that sexualization of female characters in a video game can be a sufficient condition to provoke online sexual harassment toward women.",

From this model, people having higher maladaptive metacognitive beliefs (e.g., “I can't control my thoughts”) are more likely to activate and maintain anger rumination and, in turn, to experience higher levels of anger and to act aggressively. Preliminary evidence shows the role of metacognitive beliefs on anger rumination and anger levels, whereas no studies have examined its association with aggressive behavior. This study first examined the associations between metacognitive beliefs, anger rumination, anger levels, and the propensity to engage in displaced aggression, and second, the mediation role of anger rumination in the relations among metacognitive beliefs and anger and displaced aggression. Participants were 947 students and non‐students from general population recruited in two different countries (Australia and Spain). Correlational analyses revealed a similar pattern of results in the Australian and Spanish sample, with participants having dysfunctional metacognitive beliefs also showing higher anger rumination, higher levels of anger and a higher tendency to act aggressively. Structural equation analyses revealed the associations of metacognitive beliefs with anger levels and displaced aggression was fully mediated by anger rumination in both samples. These results suggest that metacognitive beliefs should be considered in comprehensive models and in the therapy of anger problems and aggression.",

The present study examined the association between mindfulness and aggression through potential mediating effects of several emotion regulation strategies. University and community samples of U.S. adults completed questionnaires on mindfulness, emotion regulation strategies, and trait aggression. Results indicate that mindfulness was associated with rumination and expressive suppression, which mediated the mindfulness‐aggression relationship. Most facets of mindfulness were unrelated to the use of reflection and cognitive reappraisal. The nonjudging of experience facet of mindfulness was negatively related to hostility through rumination and expressive suppression. In contrast, the observing mindfulness facet was positively related to verbal aggression and hostility; these relations were mediated by rumination and expressive suppression.",

Gender differences were also examined. Results indicated that on average, bullying victimization declined over time with a significant drop noted between grade 8 and grade 9 (the transition into high school), with few differences between girls and boys. Bullying perpetration also declined for most students (no gender differences), with a notable drop found at the transition into high school. However, for a subset of adolescents, the transition into high school was accompanied by an increase in bullying perpetration. These varied experiences highlight the need to model heterogeneity when examining the impact of school transitions on bullying, a neglected focus of inquiry to date.

In addition, most of the existing studies have neglected the negative interpersonal consequences of self-directed violence. Based on the transactional model of development and relative deprivation theory, this study examined the reciprocal relationship between peer stress and self-directed violence in left-behind and non-left-behind adolescents, as well as the bidirectional mediating role of relative deprivation. A total of 1258 adolescents (683 left-behind adolescents) participated in this 10-month study with three consecutive follow-ups. Results of cross-lagged analyzes revealed that for left-behind adolescents but not non-left-behind adolescents: first, there is a vicious bidirectional cycle of peer stress and self-directed violence; second, this cycle is mediated by relative deprivation; and third, both the vicious cycle and the mediation remain consistent across different genders or educational stages. The findings highlight the need to focus on challenges such as peer stress and self-directed violence among left-behind adolescents and suggest that interventions targeting relative deprivation may break the vicious cycle between peer stress and self-directed violence in this subgroup.",

We set out to investigate the inter‐relationships among impulsiveness, social problem‐solving, aggression, and alcohol use in a non‐offender sample of British males (N=70). Of our proposed relationships, only two were significant: higher impulsivity was related to poorer social problem‐solving, and poorer social problem‐solving was related to greater aggression. Combining impulsivity and social problem‐solving indicated that poor social problem‐solving, not impulsivity, was what exerted the influence over aggression in this sample. Impulsivity perhaps presents an obstacle to learning in the early developmental years, and the legacy of poor problem‐solving is what later contributes to aggression. Aggr.

    "abstract": "This study describes behaviors generally recognised as bullying among male and female prisoners, with a subsidiary aim of comparing adult and young offenders. The study also describes the different groups involved in bullying and provides a description of the ways in which victims react to their victimization. It was predicted that gender and prison category differences would be found across the different types of bullying, with females reporting more indirect forms than males, who would report more direct forms. It was also predicted that young offenders would report more bullying than adults. The sample consisted of 98 young offenders (21 female and 77 male) and 211 adult offenders (53 female and 158 male). Inmates were surveyed via a self-report behavior checklist (Direct and Indirect Prisoner behavior Checklist: DIPC). More than half of the sample reported being and more than half reported to have bullied at least once in the past week. Males and young offenders were more likely to report bullying others than females and adults, respectively. Males were more likely than females to report bullying others both directly and indirectly. Four different groups of inmates were identified: bullies, bully/victims, pure victims; and not involved. These categories varied in different gender and prison status groups. Victims reported reacting predominantly by crying, staying in their cell when they could be out, and trying to get moved.",

    "abstract": "Most young non-human primates spend a great deal of time playing alone or with conspecifics. Despite numerous studies on social play, its adaptive functions remain unclear. A longitudinal study comparing social interactions preceding and following rank reversals among four captive adolescent chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurtii) suggests that social play during their adolescent period functioned in establishing and maintaining the dominance rank within dyads, without interventions from allies. Interventions were less frequent in rough-and-tumble play than in real fighting. Within dyads of competing chimpanzees, rough play was more frequent than gentle play. Both types of play were correlated with reciprocal aggression between competitors, and most play bouts terminated in truly aggressive conflict. Dominant individuals seemed to be responsible for maintaining play activity, by responding playfully to threats and aggression of contestants. In addition, dominant individuals more often initiated play encounters with their subordinates when the dominance relationships were clear, but subordinate individuals also initiated play sequences when they challenged the dominant's rank. The adaptive value and mechanisms of rough-and-tumble play are discussed in the context of adolescence. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Subjects were assigned to either a violent or nonviolent group based on their criminal record and the Brown History of Violence Questionnaire. Subjects participated in six 25-min sessions and completed a series of questionnaires. During the laboratory sessions subjects were given two response options: 1) Pressing button A to accumulate points exchangeable for money, and 2) pressing button B which ostensibly subtracted points from another fictitious person. Responding on button B was defined as aggressive since it resulted in the ostensible delivery of an aversive stimulus to another person. Results indicated that the subjects in the violent group emitted significantly more aggressive responses than subjects in the nonviolent group. The two groups also differed on psychometric measures of aggression.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to address two important gaps in our knowledge of brain functioning and violence: (1) What are the brain correlates of adults in the community who have suffered severe physical abuse early in life and who go on to perpetrate serious violence in adulthood? (2) What characterizes those who experience severe physical abuse but who refrain from serious violence? Four groups of participants recruited from the community (controls, severe physical child abuse only, serious violence only, and severely abused, seriously violent offenders) underwent fMRI while performing a visual/verbal working memory task. Violent offenders who had suffered severe child abuse show reduced right hemisphere functioning, particularly in the right temporal cortex. Abused individuals who refrain from serious violence showed relatively lower left, but higher right, activation of the superior temporal gyrus. Abused individuals, irrespective of violence status, showed reduced cortical activation during the working memory task, especially in the left hemisphere. Brain deficits were independent of IQ, history of head injury, task performance, cognitive strategy, and mental activity during the control task. Findings constitute the first fMRI study of brain dysfunction in violent offenders, and indicate that initial right hemisphere dysfunction, when combined with the effects of severe early physical abuse, predisposes to serious violence but that relatively good right hemisphere functioning protects against violence in physically abused children.

This study aimed to investigate the salivary testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) and the mental state responses to a real judo championship. Data about individuals' anxiety levels, strategies of coping, and patterns of behavior were thus collected. The relationship between hormonal changes and psychological variables were also analyzed. Our results showed a C response to competition, which was especially characterized by an anticipatory rise. Depending on outcome, results did not show statistically significant different C responses. The T values noted after the last fight were significantly greater in the losers than those obtained in the winners. Hormonal response did not show a relationship with psychological variables depending on the outcome. Losers showed just before the first fight an elevated cognitive anxiety, accompanied by low self-confidence. Moreover, they were characterized by type B behavior. Types of coping strategies also differentiated losers from winners. Finally, even if no relationships between hormonal and psychological variables depending on the outcome were found, our results showed that state and trait psychological variables, as well as the coping strategies, must be taken into account to better understand the response to competitive situations.

Thirty women completed approximately 10 diary entries each. In each entry, the women described a recent competitive interaction they had engaged in and noted whether it was expressed aggressively or through other tactics. Each woman received a score for the fraction of her competitive interactions that were expressed using physical aggression, verbal aggression, nothing overt, and so on. Hormones (total testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, estradiol, and cortisol) were measured in serum early in the follicular phase. Results indicate that women with low levels of androstenedione and total testosterone were less likely to express their competitive feelings overtly, while women with high levels of androstenedione were more likely than other women to express their competitive feelings through verbal aggression. Estradiol was unrelated to competitive tactics, but women with high estradiol levels reported fewer competitive interactions over athletics than did other women. Aggr.

The present study employed a wireless microphone and hidden camera to record victim and peer responses to primary school children's physical, verbal, indirect, and relational forms of aggression. The results showed that the most frequent consequences of aggression were victim retaliation or withdrawal, and peer support. In addition, the results showed limited support for the suggestion that sex differences in the use of different types of aggression arise due to differential reinforcement from victims and/or peers.

    "abstract": "Abstract Two studies report on the development and preliminary psychometric properties of a new scale measuring criminal attitudes to violence. In Study 1, the responses of a mixed sample of male prisoners were used to select 20 scale items from a larger pool. The final scale (the Criminal Attitudes to Violence Scale; CAVS) was designed so that it had a single‐factor structure and was uncorrelated with a measure of social desirability bias. It demonstrated high internal reliability, and a strong relationship to a self‐report measure of physical aggression. Significant differences were found in CAVS mean scores for various offence history comparisons, such as whether or not the offender was currently on sentence for a violent conviction. In the second study, most results from the first study were replicated with an independent sample of male prisoners. Further, compared to another scale measuring attitudes to aggression [the EXPAGG Instrumental subscale; Archer and Haigh, 1997b], the CAVS was a better predictor of general attitudes to crime. Mean CAVS scores were again significantly higher for current violent offenders than those on sentence for other types of offences. Lastly, the CAVS was moderately predictive of estimated risk of reconviction and re‐imprisonment. Overall these results suggest that this scale measures the construct of attitudes to criminal violence, which partially overlaps two other constructs: attitudes to aggression and attitudes to crime.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rough and tumble (R&amp;T) play is a unique set of behaviors that can be reliably distinguished from aggression and other childhood activities. Although it may be the most fundamental form of play, it has received comparatively little experimental attention in the human species. Forty children, ages three to six, were allowed to play in pairs (10 male pairs, 10 female pairs) during a 30 minute videotaped session with no toys available while music played in the background during every other five‐minute time period. The incidence frequency of children's play and related behavioral activities were scored using 20 behavioral categories. The major findings show only modest gender differences in the frequency of play behaviors in such controlled social encounters; the main difference is that boys engaged in slightly more physical play solicitations than girls. Music facilitated General Motor Activities (e.g., Running and Walking behaviors), but not specific R&amp;T play actions (e.g., Wrestling, Ventral and Dorsal contacts). Finally, most play behaviors as well as general activities declined systematically over the course of each recording session. This experiment highlights how human social play can be systematically studied in a controlled laboratory setting. Aggr. Behav. 29:539–551, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Physiological responses (heart rate and skin conductance) were measured during the experiment. After playing, information about state hostility and state anxiety was collected.

Different kinds of aggression were investigated in Tg8, a transgenic mouse strain lacking a functional MAO A gene. MAO A‐deficient mice differ from wild‐type C3H/HeJ (C3H) in terms of showing higher territorial, predatory and isolation‐induced aggression. Tg8 demonstrated shorter latencies to cricket killing and to the first attack after 6 weeks isolation than C3H mice. In the resident–intruder paradigm, MAO A‐lacking mice were more aggressive than C3H when tested as intruders. In contrast to C3H, attack in Tg8 mice did not depend on different aggressiveness of intruders of BALB/c, A/Sn and C3H strains. Tg8 mice displayed no increase in aggression but demonstrated reduced social investigation towards anesthetized, as well as towards juvenile BALB/c males. Thus, MAO A deficiency in Tg8 mice is accompanied by increased expression of different kinds of aggression, as well as by disruption of normal pattern of social interaction. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Violence towards others by a minority of psychotic individuals is a significant public health concern. The severity of this other‐directed violence (ODV) in the community may be influenced by insight into illness and adherence to psychotropic medications; however, few studies have tested these associations. Sixty male psychotic inpatients, legally detained at a forensic unit in New York City, were assessed with semi‐structured interviews, supplemented with information from hospital and official records, family members and the treating clinician. Results indicated that in this unique sample of detained persons with psychotic disorders; (1) increase in the severity of community violence is associated with medication non‐adherence, all dimensions of poor insight into illness, and several previously reported covariates such as substance use comorbidity; (2) no relationship was found between insight and adherence in this particular sample; (3) multivariate analyses showed that select covariates, along with medication adherence, and select insight domains predicted a total of 73% of the magnitude of ODV behavior in this sample. Overall, medication non‐adherence explained a large amount of how violently participants behaved toward others. Since non‐adherence was independent of poor insight, it may be more worthwhile for clinicians to develop treatment strategies to target medication adherence without directly addressing an elusive target such as insight into illness. Treatment addressing medication adherence needs to concomitantly target substance use behaviors since the latter was responsible for a substantial increase in ODV. Aggr.

Lapierre et al. [1995. Neuropsychologia 33:139–151] have investigated a more specific hypothesis of orbitofrontal deficits in psychopaths and found that psychopathic criminals are impaired on tasks involving behavioral inhibition and olfactory discrimination. The present study sought to replicate these results with juvenile psychopaths 14 to 18 years of age. As expected, psychopaths were found to be significantly impaired on behavioral inhibition tasks. However, psychopathic and nonpsychopathic inmates performed similarly on measures related to the dorsolateral area of the frontal lobe. Also, no significant intergroup difference was noted on the olfactory discrimination task. Although an orbitofrontal deficit in psychopathy remains possible, it is suggested to explain results through a functional inhibition deficit that is not specifically related to orbitofrontal processing.

    "abstract": "Social psychological research underscores the relation between aggression and emotion. Specifically, regulating negative affect requires the ability to appraise restraint-producing cues, such as facial signs of anger, fear and other emotions. Individuals diagnosed with major mental disorders are more likely to have engaged in violent behavior than mentally healthy members of the same communities. We examined whether violent and criminal behavior in men with schizophrenia is related to emotion recognition abilities. Forty-one men with schizophrenia underwent a computerized emotion discrimination test presenting mild and extreme intensities of happy, sad, angry, fearful and neutral faces, balanced for gender and ethnicity. History of violence was assessed by the Life History of Aggression Scale and official records of arrests. Psychopathology was rated using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale. Criminal behavior was associated with poor emotion recognition, especially for fearful and angry facial expressions. History of aggression was also associated with more severe positive symptoms and less severe negative symptoms. These findings suggest that misinterpretation of social cues such as angry and fearful expression may lead to a failure in socialization and adaptive behavior in response to emotional situation, which may result in a higher number of criminal arrests.

    "abstract": "Asymmetries in weapon size and body size, both contributing to an animal's fighting ability, may be contradictory in two fighting Macrobrachium rosenbergii males: One male may be larger in body size but smaller in cheliped size than its rival. The aim of the study was to determine the relevance of these two asymmetries in the assessment of relative fighting ability, and to reveal the effect of the asymmetry level on the structure of contests. Thirty contests were staged between male prawns from the 'blue-clawed' morphotype and the 'orange-clawed' morphotype. The blue-clawed males were 0%, 10%, or 20% larger in cheliped length but 93%, 45%, or 25% smaller in weight, respectively (n = 10), as compared to their orange-clawed opponents. The blue-clawed males with 10% and 20% advantage in cheliped length almost invariably won the contests. When similar in cheliped length, the 93% smaller blue-clawed males still won half of the contests. This indicated that the prawns ignored large asymmetries in body size even when no asymmetry in cheliped size existed. The results suggest that only cheliped size is used by M. rosenbergii males in the assessment of fighting ability. The effect of asymmetry level on contest structure was apparent only with the increase from 10% to 20% difference in cheliped size: Both the frequency and the intensity of fighting were lower in contests between prawns with 20% difference, as compared to 0% and 10% difference in cheliped length.

Men (n=43) and women (n=41) participants were provoked in a reaction time competition by receiving electric shocks and were allowed to respond to a confederate with similar shocks or to refrain from any retaliation. Results indicated that men administered more shocks, chose more intense shocks, and administered the highest available shock at a greater proportion relative to all their shock selections than did women. In contrast, women evinced a longer latency before becoming aggressive and initiated aggression at lower intensities than did men. Moreover, across shock trials, gender‐specific aggression patterns indicated that while men alternated response frequency, women gradually increased their response frequency to a peak close to the end of the task. The results confirm earlier findings of gender differences in aggression and offer new indices of aggression “flashpoint” as a step closer to understanding aggressive behavior in naturalistic circumstances.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study addresses the relationship between aggression and behaviors indicative of bullying in a sample of incarcerated male juvenile and young offenders. The study also addresses whether or not offenders who bully others and/or are bullied themselves can be identified by the type of aggression that they report. Ninety‐five juvenile and 196 young offenders completed a self‐report behavioral checklist (DIPC: Direct and Indirect Prisoner Behavior Checklist) that addressed their experience of and involvement in behaviors indicative of bullying. They also completed the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), a measure of physical and verbal aggression, anger and hostility. Four categories of offenders were identified from the DIPC ‐ pure bullies, pure victims, those who were both bullies and victims (bully/victims), and those not‐involved in bullying behavior. As predicted, behaviors measured on the DIPC that were indicative of ‘bullying others’ correlated positively with scores on the AQ. There was no indication, however, that physical AQ and physical bullying on the DIPC were the same constructs. There was a closer association between verbal AQ scores and verbal bullying on the DIPC. Bullies and bully/victims reported higher levels of physical and verbal aggression, and bully/victims reported higher levels of hostility and anger, than the other categories. It is concluded that although there are similarities between the AQ and the DIPC, there is no evidence that they are measuring the same type of aggression, although different groups involved in bullying can be partly distinguished by their scores on the AQ.

In addition a measure of self-reported aggression is included. The highest correlation appeared between sex and Expaag. Gender identity and interpersonal style made no significant improvement in explained variance in a multiple regression analysis after sex had been entered.

    "abstract": "Abstract It has been proven extremely difficult in the past to estimate the prevalence of physical aggression in children for two main reasons: (a) a heterogeneous sampling of behaviors (i.e., mix between physically aggressive and non‐physically aggressive antisocial behaviors), and (b) a lack of a “gold standard” to identify children who exhibit physically aggressive behaviors on a frequent basis. The goal of this study was to test for age differences in the prevalence of physical aggression in the Canadian population of school‐aged boys and girls, using cross‐sectional data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). The first wave of the NLSCY included a representative sample of 12,292 Canadian children aged 5–11 years. We used latent class analysis to identify children whose propensity to exhibit physically aggressive behaviors was much higher than that of other children of the same age and sex in the population. The prevalence of physical aggression was estimated at 3.7% in 5–11‐year‐old boys and ranged from .5% to 2.3% in 11 and 5‐year‐old girls, respectively. Hence, the results show a decreasing trend in the prevalence of physical aggression with age for girls, but not for boys. These findings suggest the importance of considering the developmental pathways of physical aggression for boys and girls separately. Aggr. Behav. 33:26–37, 2007. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss; Inc.",

    "abstract": "Certain personality traits have been associated with impulsive aggression in both college and community samples, primarily irritability, anger/hostility, and impulsivity. The literature regarding the psychopathology associated with impulsive aggression is relatively sparse and strongly emphasizes DSM-IV-TR [APA, 2000] Axis II personality disorders, although some comorbidity with Axis I clinical disorders has been reported. The current study compares impulsive aggressive (IA) college students with their non-aggressive peers on several self-report measures of personality and psychopathology. Personality results were as predicted, with IAs scoring higher than controls on measures of impulsivity and aggression. Additionally, the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI), which was given for exploratory purposes, revealed a unique pattern of psychopathic traits in impulsive aggression that contained key differences from the callous-unemotional profile seen in premeditated aggression. Contrary to our hypothesis that a specific pattern of psychopathology (personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) would emerge for impulsive aggression, IAs scored significantly higher than controls on nearly every clinical scale of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Somatic Complaints, Anxiety, Anxiety-Related Disorders, Depression, Mania, Schizophrenia, Borderline Features, Antisocial Features, Alcohol Problems, and Drug Problems), indicating a global elevation of psychopathology. In conclusion, while the personality traits and behaviors that characterize impulsive aggression are relatively consistent across individuals, its associated psychopathology is unexpectedly variable.

    "abstract": "Sexual jealousy can be interpreted as a strategy which serves to retain the partner and defend exclusive sexual relationships. Because of the asymmetry in paternity confidence, it should be a more important strategy for males than for females. Indeed, male sexual jealousy is apparently a cross-cultural phenomenon and is often the proximate cause of violence against the female partner. The objective of this study was to investigate through self-report whether male \"victims\" of partner infidelity are expected to react more aggressively than female \"victims,\" how subjects themselves say they would react to a partner's infidelity, and whether these expectations vary across the sexes. Contrary to our predictions, subjects expected females more than males to react aggressively and revengefully when confronted with infidelity. These expectations were mainly sustained by the female subjects. Females were also more likely than males to declare that they themselves would verbally and physically abuse the partner. In addition, female subjects anticipated that they would cry, feign indifference, and try to look attractive and cool. Males were more likely than females to report that they would get drunk. Our results on aggressive reactions represent a departure from traditional sex roles. It is argued that emancipatorial development, as well as the levelling influence of contraceptives on the sexes' parental certainty, have triggered this change in sex roles. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The participants were drawn from the Finnish Jyväskylä Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development, where aggression in 145 women and 154 men was assessed at ages 8, 14, 36, and 42. Data were collected at ages 8 and 14 by teacher ratings and peer nominations, and at ages 36 and 42 by self-ratings on aggression. The stability of aggression from childhood to middle adulthood was tested using three different LISREL models: a simplex model; a model linking aggression at age 8 to age 14 to a latent adult aggression variable (ages 36 and 42); and a model linking a latent childhood aggression variable (ages 8 and 14) to a latent adult variable. The simplex model did not fit the data, but the other two models showed that there was significant stability in aggression from childhood to adulthood. When ages 8 and 14 data were separately analyzed, it was found that, in both women and men, aggression was quite stable from age 8 to 14 and, again, from age 14 to adulthood. In men, aggression at age 8 also directly contributed to aggression in adulthood, explaining the fact that the overall stability of aggression from childhood to adulthood was higher in men than in women. However, when latent variables for child measures and for adult measures of aggression were formed, high stability (estimate .42) was observed in both genders; aggression at age 8 to 14 explained 18% of the variance of adult aggression.

    "abstract": "Adult male rats living together form dominance relationships, with one dominant and the remainder adopting subordinate roles. In previous studies, it was shown that in adult male pairs, the subordinate rat initiates more playful contacts and retains a more juvenile response to the playful contacts by the dominant. In this experiment, triads were used to examine the play between subordinate males. The subordinates directed fewer playful contacts to each other than to the dominant rat, and there was a symmetrical play relationship between the subordinates. After the dominant was removed from the colony, one subordinate became the dominant. Playful interactions amongst these pairs increased, with the subordiante intiating more playful contacts than the dominant. Furthermore, from a similarly low frequency of juvenile-type response to playful contact to each other when in triads, the subordinate in the dyads increased its frequency of juvenile responses to the dominant partner. This supports the hypothesis that the playful behavior of subordinate male rats towards the dominant is an adaptive response, playful behavior of subordinate male rats towards the dominant is an adaptive response, serving a “friendship maintenance” function. Finally, when in triads, one subordinate was more playful with the dominant than the other subordinate. It was the least playful subordinate that was the most likely to become the dominant. This sugests that within a colony, not all subordinates are the same. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A nationwide programme to prevent and manage bullying in Irish schools, based on that implemented in Norway in 1996, is currently being developed, and pilot work with a sample of primary schools within a single county of Ireland has been conducted and evaluated (the staff and pupils of 42 primary schools having been involved). A network of professionals (11 teachers) were trained to co‐ordinate the anti‐bullying programme in the schools, subsequent activities involving their training teachers (a total of 197) and parents in three to five schools each. In evaluation, pupils from 22 of the schools completed modified versions of the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire [Olweus, 1989; Whitney and Smith, 1993]. Teachers completed a questionnaire (concerning their knowledge and feelings about bullying [Rigby, 1997]) both before and after the implementation of the anti‐bullying training programme. Significant reductions were found in pupils' reports of having been victimised after the implementation of the programme. Overall, 19.6 per cent fewer children were victimised. There was a reduction of 50.0 per cent amongst those frequently victimised within the last school term, and of 43.0 per cent in reports of having been bullied within the last five school days. A reduction of 17.3 per cent in pupils' reports of having taken part in bullying others was also observed after the implementation of the programme. There were, in particular, significant reductions (69.2 per cent) in reports of frequently bullying others within the last school term, and of 51.8 per cent in reports of having taken part in bullying others within the last five school days. Whilst the programme was shown to reduce the incidence of pupils' involvement in bullying behaviour, the perennial challenge of attempting to increase the levels of pupils' reporting of bullying to teachers and parents remains a challenge for the authors to attend to in the further development of the nationwide anti‐bullying programme.

    "abstract": "Aggressive conflicts between males are often resolved by means of multiple ritualized agonistic displays without damaging escalation. Apparently, in such cases by using those displays opponents exchange important motivational and physical information on which they base a decision to stay or leave the interaction. In the Siamese fighting fish, the time spent spreading the dorsal fin and erecting the gill coverts predicts who will be the winner or loser of the interaction. Two experiments were carried out to study whether display performance might be costly. First, oxygen consumption was measured during mirror-image stimulation. This experiment showed that oxygen consumption was positively correlated with gill cover erection and dorsal fin spread. In the second experiment, a fight between two opponents was simulated and the oxygen consumption of the expected winner and loser was compared. Metabolic rates were not different between winners and losers before and during the fight, but winners showed higher oxygen consumption in the night after the fight. These results are in accordance with costs of display performance and with long-lasting physiological consequences of winning or losing a fight. Aggr. Behav. 32:1–7, 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

This study investigated the prevalence, types, and correlates of bullying behaviors in 193 male and 50 female incarcerated adolescents from nine young offender facilities. Overall, 37% of participants identified themselves as bully‐victims, 32% as pure bullies, 23% as not involved, and 8% as pure victims. In comparison to males, females were more likely to report being involved with bullying in some capacity, particularly as pure victims, and being bullied by sexual touching and comments. Pure victims reported higher rates of psychological distress and suicidal behaviors than those youth not involved in bullying, and pure bullies were more likely to have been previously incarcerated and affiliated with a gang. Bully‐victims reported the highest rates of previous abuse, peer victimization in the community, drug use, and suicide attempts while in custody. All groups, including pure victims, reported high rates of bullying others in the community. Treatment providers should recognize that offenders who are victims are often bullies as well, and be alert to broad mental health needs among victims and bully‐victims. Given the prevalence and potential serious consequences of bullying, the development of anti‐bullying policies appears to be an important step in recognizing and reducing bullying. Aggr.

CF-1 mice responded to either androgenic or estrogenic stimulation, CFW males were most sensitive to the estrogen treatments, while CD-1 males responded to androgen but were relatively insensitive to the aggression-promoting property of estrogens. These data suggest that there may be multiple aggression-activating systems and that the functional pathway varies with genotype. Additional experiments examined whether receptor binding in the hypothalamic-preoptic-septal region was related to the genetic differences in behavioral responsiveness. The binding data suggested that sensitivity to the aggression-promoting property of estrogens was related to either a higher concentration of binding sites or to higher affinity binding between estrogen and its receptor.

Emotional victimization (‘indirect’ aggression) is characterized by behavior in which mental harm is inflicted on victims through exclusionary acts, gossiping, and rumor spreading. Study one: Self‐reported questionnaires of indirect victimization [DIAS; Bjorkqvist, Lagerspetz, and Osterman, 1992] and perfectionism [multidimensional perfectionism scale; Hewitt and Flett, 1991] were administered to 162 (mean age=20.14 years) female undergraduate psychology students. Results support the predicted positive relationship between recalled indirect peer victimization and current socially prescribed/self‐oriented perfectionism. Study two: self‐reports of indirect peer victimization and perfectionism (eating disorder inventory‐perfectionism) were collected from 196 (mean age=19.5 years) female undergraduate students. Again, recalled indirect peer victimization was a statistically significant predictor of current socially prescribed/self‐oriented perfectionism whereas recalled direct (physical, verbal) peer victimization held no relation.

Subjects drawn from a group of 24 animals were paired once each with novel partners from the group under each of three experimental conditions: 1) both members of a pair were microinjected into the anterior hypothalamus with saline (S/S), 2) one member of a pair was microinjected with AVP‐receptor antagonist and its partner with saline (A/S), and 3) both members of a pair were microinjected with AVP‐receptor antagonist (A/A). There were significantly (P &lt; .01) fewer attacks during encounters between pairs of hamsters in the A/A condition compared to pairs in the A/S condition. Similarly, pairs in the A/S condition attacked significantly (P &lt; .025) less often than pairs of hamsters in the S/S condition. These results confirm our earlier work showing that AVP‐receptor antagonist reduces intraspecific aggression. In addition, saline‐treated hamsters initiated significantly (P &lt; .001) fewer attacks toward antagonist treated hamsters than would have been predicted if their opponent was not drug treated. These latter results suggest that hamsters microinjected into the anterior hypothalamus with an AVP‐receptor antagonist also elicit less aggression from conspecifics.",

Agonistic interactions measured 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 22 days after colony formation indicated that highly aggressive males on pretests continued to be more aggressive, becoming the dominant colony male in five of seven colonies and attacking intruders more often than less aggressive males. In the two remaining colonies the moderately aggressive male became dominant. This relationship, which was consistent over a number of indices, including offensive and defensive behaviors, and wound counts and wound sites, was seen even when a substantial weight differential favored the less aggressive animal. Dominance relationships were rapidly established and within-group fighting declined significantly over the 21-day test period. Pretest offensive levels also influenced the behavior of subordinates, with high or moderately aggressive subordinates showing more defense in interactions with dominants and receiving more wounds than did low-aggression subordinates. Dominant males also showed more defense in interacting with those subordinates which had been more aggressive during pretests. This pattern of results suggests that aggression level of the subordinate as well as the dominant may be an important factor determining the intensity of agonistic interactions in male rats.",

In Study 1 (N = 145), participants recorded recently occurring incidents that had generated feelings of aggression in them and recorded their affect at the time of the event using the Positive and Negative Affectivity Scale. The results showed that aggression-triggering events provoked positive as well as negative affect in the sample. In Study 2 (N = 849), a 23-item scale was generated based on the events recorded during Study 1. The scale comprised two sub-scales: Frustrations and Provocations, which showed good internal reliability and good factor congruency between male and female participants' factor structures. Studies 3 (N = 241) and 4 (N = 219) demonstrated the convergent reliability of the STAR scale with measures of trait aggression [Buss and Perry, 1992] and trait narcissism [Raskin and Terry, 1988] with self-concept clarity [Campbell, Trapnell, Heine et al., 1996]. Again, the STAR scale showed good internal reliability. There were no effects of sex on STAR scale scores across Studies 3 and 4. It is suggested, therefore, that sex differences may become more salient when examining aggressive behavior, rather than aggressive feelings. Aggr. Behav. 32:1–12, 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The social-interactional processes that might produce the developmental genotype-environment interaction were investigated. Line-specific interaction patterns within long-established sibling groups predicted aggressive behavior in cross-situational dyadic assessments. Group rearing attenuated most line differences in aggressive measures, but the high-aggressive line was more likely than the low-aggressive line to persist in attacking over consecutive days of observation.

It was hypothesized that proactive aggressive subjects would show greater numbers of personality disorders and have greater psychopathy relative to reactive-only and nonaggressive subjects.

However, prediction of general aggression, and in particular unprovoked aggression, in nonforensic men who possess such traits has received little experimental attention to date. This study examined the role of psychopathic traits in the prediction of unprovoked aggression in a nonforensic sample. One hundred and five men completed the Levenson Self‐Report Psychopathy Scales and competed in a sham aggression paradigm. These men were identified as unprovoked aggressors, provoked aggressors , and provoked nonaggressors contingent on their responses to the experimental paradigm. Findings indicated that men with high levels of psychopathic traits had a 30% greater probability of becoming aggressive in the absence of provocation relative to those with lower psychopathic traits. Results also indicated that unprovoked aggressors evinced more general aggression when provocation was initiated.

Men were found to perpetrate higher levels of general violence and nonviolent offenses than women, but women perpetrated significantly more IPV than men. Cluster B PD traits predicted all three offense types for women and also men's general violence and nonviolent offending. Women's general violence and men's non-violence also had one unique risk factor each, low agreeableness, and low conscientiousness, respectively. The main difference was for IPV, where men's IPV was predicted by cluster A PD traits, indicating that men's and women's risk factors for IPV may be different, although their risk factors for the other offense types were fairly consistent.",

One class of youth engaged in primarily rule breaking and norm violations including underage alcohol use, typical of this age period. A second class was more actively delinquent emphasizing drug use, trespassing, and various forms of disobedience. A third class of highly delinquent youth differed from their counterparts by endorsing drug use, thievery that involved stealing money, goods, and cars, property damage, gambling, precocious sexual experiences, involvement with pornographic materials, and fighting. Multinomial logistic regression predicting class membership indicated highly delinquent youth were more likely to be older males, use venting coping strategies, and be fun or novelty seeking compared with rule breakers.

In one series of experiments, cats, implanted with electrodes from which attack had been elicited, were anesthetized and then were injected with a bolus of 14C-2-deoxyglucose at the same time as electrical stimulation was delivered through the attack electrodes. Brains prepared for X-ray autoradiography revealed that lateral hypothalamic stimulation activated the classical medial forebrain bundle pathway supplying the septal region, diagonal band, lateral preoptic area, and ventral tegmental region. Stimulation of quiet-attack sites in perifornical hypothalamus resulted in the activation of a much more extensive projection system which included the central and lateral tegmental fields of the midbrain and pons, and central gray region, as well as the structures described above. In a second series of experiments, 3H-leucine was placed into the region of the electrode tip from which attack was elicited in order to identify more precisely the pathways arising from that site. In general, tritiated amino acid radioautography replicated the 14C-2-deoxyglucose findings. In addition, the amino acid radioautographic data revealed the presence of extensive projections from perifornical hypothalamus to such pontine structures as the nucleus locus coeruleus, motor nucleus of NV, and the lateral pontine tegmental field. The functional connections between the lateral hypothalamic “attack region” and lateral preoptic zone were also confirmed by electrophysiological methods.",

Even so, it remains unclear whether these behavioral subtypes have meaningfully different interpersonal correlates, particularly as they are subsumed within the same broad domain of antisocial behavior. To evaluate this, we examined whether hostile perceptions of others (assessed via exposure to a series of neutral unknown faces) were linked to level and type of antisocial behavior aggression vs. rule‐breaking, and moreover, whether this association persisted even when also considering the common association with negative affect (as manipulated via written recollection of one's best and worst life experiences). Analyses revealed that aggression, but not rule‐breaking, was uniquely tied to hostile perceptions of others. Furthermore, this association persisted over and above the common association of both hostile perceptions and aggression with negative affect (at both trait and state levels). Such results provide additional support for clinically meaningful differences between the behavioral subtypes of aggression and nonaggressive rule‐breaking and for the independent role of hostile perceptions in aggressive behavior.

It was hypothesised that convenience sampled targets of aggression differs from targets in general with regards to both demographic characteristics and degree of aggression exposed to. A convenience sample comprising support‐seeking targets of workplace bullying was compared with a representative sample of Norwegian targets of bullying. The results showed that the two samples differed significantly on all demographic variables investigated, except gender. A far higher percentage of the convenience sample had blown the whistle on illegal, immoral or illegitimate practice at their workplace, whereas they also reported significantly more frequent and more intense exposure to aggression. The findings confirm that convenience samples have low external validity when generalising to the general population. Such samples should therefore mainly be used to investigate tendencies in, and the phenomenology of, interpersonal aggression, in studies where generalisability is not the principal objective. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Field observations of \"surplus killing\" and laboratory studies of operant performance rewarded by prey-killing opportunities suggest that predatory behavior is positively reinforcing. Similarly, both repeated encounter and operant performance studies suggest that intraspecific aggression can be positively reinforcing for successful aggressors. While a few studies suggest that defensive aggression under aversive conditions may also be positively reinforcing, it appears that when appropriate response modes are available escape and/or avoidance are preferred to attack. Studies of the reinforcing properties of aggression-eliciting brain stimulation are in general agreement with these conclusions, but methodological problems with these latter observations render them less compelling. The progressive escalation of aggression seen in \"warm-up effects\" of birds and fish, \"priming effects\" of mice, and ecstatic violence of humans may be analogous processes based on the positively self-reinforcing characteristics of some kinds of aggression. The transient reductions of aggression which appear as refractory periods and satiation effects in a variety of species may reflect temporary reductions in the reinforcing value of aggression. All these temporal effects must be considered in the evaluation of experiments on the reinforcing value of aggression. More generally, it is possible that these temporal fluctuations reflect the operation of common motivational processes (aggressive states) which regulate overt aggression by changing its reinforcing value.",

The sample consisted of 636 participants (311 females and 325 males, age range 11-16 years; 71% White). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a revised version of Underwood's framework for each of the four participant role scales. Internal consistencies for each scale ranged from .93 to .97. Results revealed that social victimization was related to an increase in anxiety, depressive, and externalizing behaviors. Social bullying was associated with an increase in general externalizing behaviors only. Social witnessing was moderately correlated with depression scores. Intervening in social bullying was not linked with psychological maladjustment or externalizing behaviors. The SBIS provides a comprehensive measure of social victimization, social bullying, social witnessing, and social intervening.",

    "abstract": "This study asked how individual differences in social cognition and personality interact in predicting later aggressive behavior. It was hypothesized that the relationship between immediate response evaluations in social information processing (SIP) and later aggressive behavior would be moderated by impulsivity. In particular, the immediate positive evaluations of aggressive responses would be more strongly related to later aggressive behavior for high-impulsive than for low-impulsive individuals, because high-impulsive children would be less likely to integrate peripheral information and consider long-term future consequences of their actions. Participants were 585 adolescents (52% male) and their mothers and teachers from the longitudinal Child Development Project. Structural equation modeling indicated that teacher-reported impulsivity at ages 11-13 moderated the association between adolescents' endorsement of aggressive responses in hypothetical, ambiguous situations and subsequent mother-reported aggressive behavior. Specifically, positive endorsement of aggressive responses at age 13 was significantly related to later aggressive behavior (age 14-17) for participants with high and medium levels of impulsivity, but this association was not significant for participants with low levels of impulsivity. This study provides evidence of personality variables as potential moderators of the link between SIP and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of mutual and nonmutual intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration were identified in a sample of female college freshmen (N = 499). Using female reports, couples were classified as to whether the relationship included no IPV, female-only IPV, or mutual IPV (male-only IPV was too rare to analyze). Mutual IPV was more common than asymmetrical IPV, and women in mutually violent relationships perpetrated more frequent acts of physical aggression than those in female-only violent relationships. In cross-sectional analyses of IPV in the first semester of college, only partner antisocial behavior and psychological aggression distinguished female-only IPV from no IPV; witnessing mother-to-father aggression, higher psychological aggression, more frequent partner marijuana use, partner antisocial behavior, and, surprisingly, higher relationship satisfaction, discriminated mutual IPV from no IPV. Contrary to hypothesis, first semester (T1) IPV did not predict having a new partner in the second semester (T2); however, women who reported more frequent heavy episodic drinking and lower relationship satisfaction at T1 were more likely to be in a different relationship at T2. Prospective prediction of T2 IPV category failed to support the hypothesis that female-only IPV would escalate to mutual IPV. The majority of couples with female-only IPV reported no IPV at T2. After accounting for T1 IPV, the only significant predictor of T2 IPV category was T1 psychological aggression, suggesting that this may be an appropriate target for IPV prevention efforts among college dating couples.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study evaluated bidirectional associations between substance use, aggression, and delinquency across sixth, seventh, and eighth grades using data available from a large study of urban minority youth ( n = 2,931). Group‐based trajectory analysis revealed trajectories of aggression, delinquency, and substance use which support the existence of both adolescent‐limited and life‐course persistent offenders. In addition, a pattern of decreasing aggression was observed during middle school. Clear temporal associations were observed between developmental changes in aggression, delinquency, and substance use. Notably, the decreasing aggression trajectory was as likely to be associated with high trajectories of substance initiation as was the high aggression trajectory. Furthermore, trajectories of delinquency were differentially associated with future substance use; however, substance use trajectories did not predict trajectories of delinquency. There were few gender differences in the developmental progression of these problem behaviors during middle school with only two exceptions, males were more likely to follow a trajectory of decreasing aggression and a trajectory of high stable delinquency. Evaluations of ethnic/racial differences in the trajectory group membership also revealed few differences. The results of this study provide important information regarding interconnections between developmental changes in problem behavior that occur during the middle school years, highlighting groups that may be missed via traditional analytic approaches that predict mean changes.

These items comprise the Cardiff Infant Contentiousness Scale (CICS). Evidence for the reliability and validity of the CICS is provided from analyses of a sample of N=310 British infants, assessed at a mean age of 6 months as part of a larger longitudinal study of the development of aggression. The informants' CICS ratings demonstrated reasonable levels of internal consistency and interrater agreement. Informants' ratings were validated by observations of infants' distress in response to restraint in a car seat. Longitudinal analyses revealed that contentiousness was stable over time and that contentiousness at 6 months predicted infants' later use of force with peers. When used in the company of other methods, the simple four-item CICS scale could serve as a useful screen for early manifestations of aggressiveness in human infants.",

    "abstract": "Aggression is defined as a mechanism of spacing by means of force or displays. It has evolved independently in different animal groups. The mechanisms underlying it are therefore not homologous throughout the animal kingdom. The phenomenon of aggression is so widespread, however, that strong selection pressures must be responsible for its development along analogous lines. Its most obvious functions are in competition for mates, natural resources, and territories, and in the preservation of group identity in many gregarious species. Aggression is often ritualized so that no damage is done to conspecifics. This ritualization may appear as modification of fighting into a tournament, or as the development of submissive postures which block further aggression in the opponent shortly after the onset of a potentially damaging fight. Animal aggression is preprogrammed by phylogenetic adaptation in well-defined ways, but can be modified by experience. The inborn programs involve motor patterns, innate releasing mechanisms, releasers, motivating mechanisms, and learning dispositions specific for the species. Aggression on this biological level can be observed in humans as intragroup aggression. Certain motor patterns and signals which lead to the release of aggression are universal. Some can even be found in deaf- and blind-born people, proving their innateness. A number of patterns of aggression in man are highly ritualized and - in a way analogous to that found in many animals - mechanisms of control have evolved inhibiting the killing of a conspecific. There are strong indications of the existence of motivating mechanisms within the brain, e.g., in the form of neuronal circuits, that show a degree of spontaneity. The type of destructive aggression which we call war, is a product of cultural evolution. War takes advantage of the given motivational structure of man, including his fear of strangers, which develops in every baby independently of experience and makes men inclined to form closed groups and causes them to be wary of or hostile to strangers. Based on these tendencies, man underwent a process of cultural subspeciation. Groups demarcated themselves from others by custom, erecting communication barriers. The development of languages demonstrates how fast and efficient this process is. Members of the same group, during this process, were defined as the \"real man,\" outsiders often were to be valued less -or even considered nonhuman. On the basis of this self-indoctrination, cultural codes of conduct developed, which allowed members of other groups to be killed when groups competed for resources. A cultural fiiter of norms was established which demanded killing under defined conditions, and was superimposed upon the biological filter of norms which inhibits the killing of a human being. This results in a conflict of norms, which is universally felt as guilt, since the biological filter of norms, though superimposed, is nonetheless working, particularly in the circumstance of a personal encounter. The more advanced the technique of armament, which allows fast and distant killing, the less the inhibitions are activated. Nonetheless, ritualizations occur on the cultural level. Warfare is sometimes ritualized and conventions are developed to prevent escalation into massacres, or the wholesale destruction of the subjugated enemy. To a great extent, this is certainly a result of our inborn moral code, If nothing like this were given to man our situation would be disastrous indeed. Whether cultural evolution will, in the future, be guided by moral maxims in accord with our human nature is a deeision men must make rationally. Although a ruthless ethnocentrism may bring advantage to a warring group, this may eventually prove fatal to mankind as a whole. In the escalating competition mankind runs the danger not only of exhausting its resources, but of destroying itself with its new weapons. If the outcome were not selfdestruction but domination by one group it would impoverish the diversity of human cultures, and thus seriously cut down man's spectrum of adaptability. War fulfills certain functions, similar to those found in animals. It is mainly a mechanism for preserving and extending one's territory, and a means of getting access to scarce resources. It is therefore dangerous to consider war merely as a pathological form of human behavior because this may distract our attention from the fact that, h order to overcome war, the functions of war have to be fulfilled by nonviolent means. Cultural evolution phenocopies biological evolution, due to similarities in the selection pressures shaping its course. This allows us to define the point of the evolutionary spiral we are at currently and to predict our future course.",

This effect is shown to be independent of face-saving motivation. Following a public or private provocation, Study 1 participants were induced to ruminate or were distracted for 20 min. They then had an opportunity to aggress against another person who either acted in a neutral or mildly annoying fashion (viz. triggering event). As expected, the magnitude of the greater displaced aggression of those who ruminated before the triggering event compared with those distracted was greater under public than private provocation. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 and confirmed that public provocations are experienced as more intense. Studies 3 and 4 both manipulated provocation intensity directly to show that it mediated the moderating effect of public/private provocation found in Study 1. The greater intensity of a public provocation increases reactivity to a subsequent trigger, which in turn, augments triggered displaced aggression.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that among the different conduct disorder (CD) behaviors, physical aggression, but not theft, links to low neurocognitive abilities. Specifically, physical aggression has consistently been found to be negatively related to neurocognitive abilities, whereas theft has been shown to be either positively or not related to neurocognition. The specificity of these links needs further examination because attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) links to both physical aggression and neurocognitive variation. The development of self-reported physical aggression and theft, from age 11 to 17 years, was studied in a prospective at-risk male cohort via a dual process latent growth curve model. Seven neurocognitive tests at age 20 were regressed on the growth parameters of physical aggression and theft. The links between neurocognition and the growth parameters of physical aggression and theft were adjusted for ADHD symptoms at ages 11 and 15 (parent, child and teacher reports). Results indicated that verbal abilities were negatively related to physical aggression while they were positively associated with theft. However, inductive reasoning was negatively associated with increases in theft across adolescence. Symptoms of ADHD accounted for part of the neurocognitive test links with physical aggression but did not account for the associations with theft. These differences emphasize the importance of examining specific CD behaviors to better understand their neurodevelopmental mechanisms. They also suggest that youth who engage in different levels of physical aggression or theft behaviors may require different preventive and corrective interventions. Aggr.

Different associations between psychopathy dimensions and executive functioning might explain contradicting findings. This study examined the role of psychopathy dimensions and types of aggression in response inhibition among 117 male adolescents (53 antisocial delinquents and 64 controls). Participants completed a self‐report measure of aggression and a GoNoGo task. Psychopathy dimensions were assessed using the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version. Although high scores on the antisocial dimension and reactive aggression were associated with poor response inhibition, the affective–interpersonal dimension, proactive aggression, and verbal intelligence (IQ) were related to better response inhibition (two‐factor model). Associations with the affective–interpersonal dimensions did not reach significance. Exploratory analyses showed that affective and antisocial facets accounted for the obtained opposing associations of the affective–interpersonal and antisocial psychopathy dimensions with response inhibition. The interpersonal and lifestyle facets (four‐facet model) were unrelated to response inhibition. Results could not be explained by Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Findings suggest differential associations between the psychopathy dimensions, types of aggression, and response inhibition. Therefore, a dimensional approach to psychopathy and related concepts, such as aggression, might strongly improve diagnostic procedures. Global scores could mask important differential associations.

The IRT analyses revealed that the scale was essentially unidimensional and had excellent reliability in the upper ranges of the latent bullying tendency trait, as intended and desired. Gender DIF effects were identified with regard to girls' use of indirect bullying by social exclusion and boys' use of physical bullying by hitting and kicking but these effects were small and worked in opposite directions, having negligible effects at the scale level. Also scale scores adjusted for DIF effects differed very little from non-adjusted scores. In conclusion, the empirical data were well characterized by the chosen IRT model and the Olweus Bullying scale was considered well suited for the conduct of fair and reliable comparisons involving different gender-age groups.

Moreover, relational aggression and victimization were measured via both self‐ and peer report, and discrepancies between reports were considered as correlates of symptoms and peer relationship status. Adolescents who reported more symptoms of depression and anxiety also self‐reported more relational victimization and reported their peers as less trustworthy. Adolescents who overreported their own relational victimization and aggression compared with peer report had more symptoms compared with those who agreed with their peers or underreported their aggression and victimization. Adolescents who underreported their own aggression were not only more socially prominent but were also more disliked by their peers. When considered independent of self‐reports, no measure of peer‐reported peer status, aggression, or victimization was associated with depressive symptoms; but adolescents reported as more accepted by their peers had fewer anxiety symptoms. Longitudinal research should be conducted to examine adolescents' increasing socioemotional problems as correlates of discrepancies between self‐ and peer reports of relational aggression and victimization.

People high in maladaptive perfectionism, the tendency to focus on the discrepancy between one's standards and performance, are characterized by an exaggerated negative affective response to negative feedback. This exacerbated affective response to failure may then dispose them to hurt others and themselves as aggression and self-harm are often perceived as a means to regulate negative affect. In Study 1, we demonstrated that maladaptive perfectionism was linked to greater aggressive behavior towards others after receiving negative feedback. Suggesting the presence of an emotion regulation strategy, this effect was mediated by the motivation to use aggression to improve mood. In Study 2, maladaptive perfectionism was linked to self-harm, an effect exacerbated by negative feedback and mediated by negative affect. These findings suggest that maladaptive perfectionists are at risk for greater harm towards others and the self because negative feedback has a stronger affective impact and harming others and the self is perceived a means to alleviate this aversive state.",

A series of nested structural equation models tested the hypothesized links among these peer‐domain factors. It was hypothesized that (1) relational aggression trails both adaptive and maladaptive processes, linking to more peer victimization and more peer liking, whereas physical aggression is maladaptive, resulting in more peer victimization and less peer liking; (2) physical and relational victimization is maladaptive, relating to more aggression and less peer liking; (3) peer liking may be the social context that promotes relational aggression (not physical aggression), whereas peer liking may protect against peer victimization, regardless of its type; and (4) peer liking mediates the link between forms of aggression and forms of peer victimization. Results showed that higher levels of peer liking predicted relative increases in relational aggression (not physical aggression), which in turn led to more peer liking. On the other hand, more peer liking was predictive of relative decreases in relational aggression and relational victimization in transition to the next grade (i.e., fifth grade). In addition, relational victimization predicted relative increases in relational aggression and relative decreases in peer liking. Similarly, physical aggression was consistently and concurrently associated more physical victimization and was marginally predictive of relative increases in physical victimization in transition to the next grade. More peer liking predicted relative decreases in physical victimization, which resulted in lower levels of peer liking.

Attention problems and impulsiveness proved to be a distinct construct from other processes believed to mediate aggression (aggressive beliefs, aggression related schemata, trait anger, and trait hostility). Attention problems and impulsiveness were uniquely related to both media exposure (total weekly hours and violent content) and aggression. Attention problems and impulsiveness were particularly related to impulsive (as opposed to premeditated) aggression.

    "abstract": "To date, research identifying moderators of the alcohol-intimate partner aggression (IPA) relationship has focused almost exclusively on male-perpetrated aggression, without accounting for the dyadic processes of IPA. The current study examined hazardous alcohol use and impulse control difficulties as predictors of IPA among a sample of 73 heterosexual dating couples. Both actor and partner effects of these risk factors on physical and psychological aggression were examined. Results indicated that impulse control difficulties were an important actor and partner predictor of both physical and psychological aggression. Findings supported the multiple threshold model such that the interaction between impulse control difficulties and hazardous alcohol use significantly predicted physical aggression severity. These results suggest the importance of targeting impulse control difficulties and hazardous alcohol use in IPA treatment, as well as the advantages of examining risk factors of IPA within a dyadic rather than individual framework.",

    "abstract": "The human tendency to impose costs on those who have behaved antisocially towards third parties (third-party punishment) has a formative influence on societies, yet very few studies of the development of this tendency exist. In most studies where young children have punished, participants have imposed costs on puppets, leaving open the question as to whether young children punish in real third-party situations. Here, five-year-olds were given the opportunity to allocate desirable or unpleasant items to antisocial and neutral adults, who were presented as real and shown on video. Neutral individuals were almost always allocated only desirable items. Antisocial individuals were instead usually allocated unpleasant items, as long as participants were told they would give anonymously. Most participants who were instead told they would give in person did not allocate unpleasant items, although a minority did so. This indicates that the children interpreted the situation as real, and that whereas they genuinely desired to punish antisocial adults, they did not usually dare do so in person. Boys punished more frequently than girls. The willingness of preschoolers to spontaneously engage in third-party punishment, occasionally even risking the social costs of antagonizing an anti-social adult, demonstrates a deep-seated early-developing punitive sentiment in humans.",

Independently, participants' STMO, HS, and sexual harassment myth acceptance (SHMA) were assessed. Correlational and path analyses revealed that STMO specifically predicted unwanted sexual attention, whereas HS predicted both unwanted sexual attention and gender harassment.

Despite evidence concerning the association of spanking with antisocial behavior, not all children who are spanked develop antisocial traits. Given the heterogeneous effects of spanking on behavior, it is possible that a third variable may condition the influence of corporal punishment on child development. We test this possibility using data drawn from a nationally representative dataset of twin siblings. Our findings suggest that genetic risk factors condition the effects of spanking on antisocial behavior. Moreover, our results provide evidence that the interaction between genetic risk factors and corporal punishment may be particularly salient for males.

Study 1, using data based on a cross‐section of the general population of eight European countries (France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and the UK; N = 7,042), examined this hypothesis in the context of aggressive action tendencies towards immigrants. Study 2, using longitudinal data obtained from a general population sample in Northern Ireland, considered effects on aggressive action tendencies between ethno‐religious groups in conflict. Both studies confirmed our predictions, showing that while perceived threat was associated with greater intergroup aggressive tendencies, positive intergroup contact was indirectly associated with reduced aggressive action tendencies, via reduced intergroup threat.

This study investigates the associations among sustaining IPV and alcohol/drug abuse among both a clinical and community sample of men. The clinical sample is comprised of 302 men who sustained intimate terrorism—a form of IPV that is characterized by much violence and controlling behavior—from their female partners and sought help. The community sample is composed of 520 men, 16% of whom sustained common couple violence, a lower level of more minor reciprocal IPV. Analyses showed that among both groups of men who sustained IPV, the prevalence and frequency of alcohol/drug abuse was significantly higher than in men who did not sustain IPV. However, a dose–response relationship between sustaining IPV and alcohol/drug abuse was found only among men in the community sample. Path modeling showed that, for the community sample, the best fitting models were ones that showed that the alcohol/drug abuse predicted IPV victimization, an association that was fully mediated by their use of IPV.

    "abstract": "This research examined developmental trajectories for social and physical aggression for a sample followed from age 9 to 18, and investigated possible family predictors of following different trajectory groups. Participants were 158 girls and 138 boys, their teachers, and their parents (21% African American, 5.3% Asian, 51.6% Caucasian, and 21% Hispanic). Teachers rated children's social and physical aggression yearly in grades 3–12. Participants' parent (83% mothers) reported on family income, conflict strategies, and maternal authoritarian and permissive parenting styles. The results suggested that both social and physical aggression decline slightly from middle childhood through late adolescence. Using a dual trajectory model, group‐based mixture modeling revealed three trajectory groups for both social and physical aggression: low‐, medium‐, and high‐desisting for social aggression, and stably‐low, stably‐medium, and high‐desisting for physical aggression. Membership in higher trajectory groups was predicted by being from a single‐parent family, and having a parent high on permissiveness. Being male was related to both elevated physical aggression trajectories and the medium‐desisting social aggression trajectory. Negative interparental conflict strategies did not predict social or physical aggression trajectories when permissive parenting was included in the model. Permissive parenting in middle childhood predicted following higher social aggression trajectories across many years, which suggests that parents setting fewer limits on children's behaviors may have lasting consequences for their peer relations. Future research should examine transactional relations between parenting styles and practices and aggression to understand the mechanisms that may contribute to changes in involvement in social and physical aggression across childhood and adolescence.

However, further research to evaluate the relative role of combat exposures and overt physical behaviors is required to further elucidate potential associations between military service, combat deployment, and overt physical aggression. The purpose of the current study was to assess the prevalence of self‐reported physical aggression in a sample of US A rmy soldiers using an adaptation of the R evised C onflict T actics S cale ( CTS 2), and examine factors associated with higher levels of aggression. A population‐based cross‐sectional study was conducted at a single US A rmy I nstallation within a sample of active duty US A rmy soldiers (n = 6,128) from two large units. Anonymous surveys were collected 6 months following deployment to measure overt aggressive behaviors, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury, and misuse of alcohol. There were a relatively higher number of minor and severe physical overt aggressive actions reported among soldiers who previously deployed, notably highest among deployed soldiers reporting the highest levels of combat intensity. Soldiers screening positive for the misuse of alcohol were also significantly more likely to report relatively higher levels of physical aggression. This study quantified overt aggressive behaviors and associated factors, showing increasing combat exposures may result in increased physical aggression. Clinicians treating service members returning from combat may consider assessing relative levels of combat. Aggr. Behav. 38:357‐367, 2012. Published 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.†",

Immediately afterwards, participants engaged in an analog displaced aggression task. Results revealed direct, positive associations between negative urgency and aggression. In addition, the use of suppression was associated with greater aggression than was the use of reappraisal alone.

The honor threat in these studies was based on previous research which has shown that honesty is a key element of the conception of honor and that accusations of dishonesty are threatening to one's honor. In both studies, participants wrote an essay describing the role of honesty in their lives and received feedback on their essay accusing them of being dishonest (vs. neutral feedback). Turkish participants retaliated more strongly than did northern U.S. participants against the person who challenged their honesty by assigning him/her to solve more difficult tangrams over easy ones (Study 1) and by choosing sensory tasks of a higher level of intensity to complete (Study 2). Study 2 added a relational honor condition, in which participants wrote about honesty in their parents' lives and examined the role of individual differences in honor values in retaliation. Endorsement of honor values significantly predicted retaliation among Turkish participants in the relational honor attack condition, but not among northern U.S. participants. Aggr.

Positive links over time from maternal criticism to proactive (but not reactive) aggression were also present. Emotion dysregulation and proactive aggression were linked only indirectly via maternal criticism. Gender did not significantly moderate these links.

Participants were a diverse community sample (54% African American) of heterosexual males (N = 156) between 21 and 35 years of age who were recruited to complete the study with a male friend and an ostensibly single, heterosexual female who reported a strong dislike of sexual content in the media. Participants viewed a sexually explicit or nonsexually explicit film clip as part of contrived media rating task and made individual choices of which film clip to show the female confederate. Immediately thereafter, participants were required to reach consensus on a group decision of which film clip to show the female confederate. Subjecting a target to an unwanted experience with a sexual connotation was operationalized as selection of the sexually explicit video, whereas successful bystander intervention was operationalized as the event of one partner individually selecting the sexually explicit video but then selecting the nonsexually explicit video for the group choice. Results demonstrated that a 1-year history of sexual aggression and endorsement of pertinent misogynistic attitudes significantly predicted selection of the sexually-explicit video. In addition, bystander efficacy significantly predicted men's successful prevention of their male peer's intent to show the female confederate a sexually explicit video. Discussion focused on how these data inform future research and bystander intervention programming for sexual aggression.",

The aim of the study was to implement the PSAP in a functional neuroimaging environment (fMRI) and evaluate aggression-related brain reactivity including response to provocations and associations with aggression within the paradigm. Twenty healthy participants completed two 12-min PSAP sessions within the scanner. We evaluated brain responses to aggressive behavior (removing points from an opponent), provocations (point subtractions by the opponent), and winning points. Our results showed significant ventral and dorsal striatal reactivity when participants won a point and removed one from the opponent. Provocations significantly activated the amygdala, dorsal striatum, insula, and prefrontal areas. Task-related aggressive behavior was positively correlated with neural reactivity to provocations in the insula, the dorsal striatum, and prefrontal areas. Our findings suggest the PSAP within an fMRI environment may be a useful tool for probing aggression-related neural pathways. Activity in the amygdala, dorsal striatum, insula, and prefrontal areas during provocations is consistent with the involvement of these brain regions in emotional and impulsive behavior. Striatal reactivity may suggest an involvement of reward during winning and stealing points.",

To date, the related construct of schema modes, which presents a comprehensive and integrated schema unit, has received scant empirical attention. Furthermore, EMSs and schema modes have yet to be examined concurrently with respect to aggressive behavior. This study examined associations between EMSs, schema modes, and aggression in an offender sample. Two hundred and eight adult male prisoners completed self‐report psychological tests measuring their histories of aggression, EMSs, and schema modes. Regression analyses revealed that EMSs were significantly associated with aggression but did not account for a unique portion of variance once the effects of schema modes were taken into account. Three schema modes, Enraged Child, Impulsive Child, and Bully and Attack, significantly predicted aggression. These findings support the proposition that schema modes characterized by escalating states of anger, rage, and impulsivity characterize aggressive offenders. In this regard, we call attention to the need to include schema modes in contemporary social‐cognitive aggression theories, and suggest that systematic assessment and treatment of schema modes has the potential to enhance outcomes with violent offenders.",

A positive testosterone/cortisol ratio, that is, high testosterone relative to cortisol, was found to be associated with aggressive behavior, explaining 7% of the variance. The interaction between testosterone and cortisol was not related to aggressive behavior and gender differences were not found. The ratio may reflect an imbalance leaving the individual more prone to rewarding aspects, than fearful of negative implications of aggressive behavior.

Analyses of physical assaults involving homosexual and heterosexual couples did not support the hypothesis that women attacked by their male partners are less likely to cooperate than victims of other assaults. Analyses of violent offenses more generally showed that victims of violence were more likely to refuse to cooperate if they knew the offender in any way than if the offender was a stranger. In the case of physical and sexual assault, these effects were mainly observed for minor incidents. Finally, victims of sexual assault were more likely to cooperate with the police than victims of physical assault. The findings suggest the importance of comparing the victim's reactions to intimate partner violence and sexual assault to their reactions to other offenses.",

    "abstract": "Objectification involves reducing someone to a sexual object, rather than seeing them as a full person. Despite numerous theoretical claims that people are more aggressive toward the objectified, and empirical evidence that objectification is linked to high willingness to aggress, rape proclivity, and aggressive attitudes, no research has examined a causal link between objectification and physical aggression, particularly in the context of provocation. In two experiments, we examined this predicted link. In Experiment 1, using a 2 (objectification: no/yes) × 2 (provocation: no/yes) factorial between‐subjects design, we investigated the effects of objectification, induced via body focus during a face‐to‐face interaction, and provocation on physical aggression toward a female confederate. Our results revealed a significant main effect of provocation, a marginal main effect of objectification, and a significant interaction between these variables. In the absence of a provocation, focusing on a woman's body increased aggression toward her. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1 using a video of a target woman instead of a face‐to‐face interaction. Again, our results showed a significant two‐way interaction between objectification and provocation, wherein objectification increased aggression in the absence of provocation. Overall, this research indicates that objectification can lead to heightened physical aggression toward objectified women.",

This study used a cross‐cultural comparative design to examine the prevalence of students’ reports of student‐to‐teacher and teacher‐to‐student victimization and the correlations between them, both at the student and the school levels. It compares the patterns of findings among Jewish and Arab students in Israel and a sample of Chilean students. A nationally representative student sample in Israel ( N = 24,243 students from 474 schools) and a Chilean purposeful sample ( N = 24,243 students from 37 schools) answered questions regarding being victimized by teachers, and victimizing their teachers. Four cultural groups were compared: Jewish secular, Jewish religious, Arab, and Chilean students. Findings indicate that students reported that they victimized their teachers more verbally than physically. They also reported being victimized by their teachers, more verbally and less physically and sexually. These patterns were quite similar across the cultural groups, although there were significant differences between them in the prevalence of student‐to‐teacher and teacher‐to‐student victimization. The two types of victimization were associated: students who reported being victimized by teachers also tended to report that they victimized teachers, and schools in which teacher‐to‐student victimization was more prevalent were also schools in which student‐to‐teacher victimization tended to be more frequent. We discuss these findings both theoretically and regarding their implications for policy and practice.",

The link between these factors and group-based aggression, however, has not been examined in the context of street gangs. The current study assessed the relationship among in-group identification, perceptions of out-group entitativity, and the willingness to retaliate against members of rival groups who did not themselves attack the in-group among juvenile gang and non-gang members in London. Our results showed the predicted membership (gang/non-gang) × in-group identification × entitativity interaction. Decomposition of the three-way interaction by membership revealed a significant identification × entitativity interaction for gang, but not for non-gang members. More specifically, gang members who identify more strongly with their gang and perceived a rival group as high on entitativity were more willing to retaliate against any of them. In addition, entitativity was a significant predictor of group-based aggression after controlling for gender, in-group identification, and gang membership. Our results are consistent with socio-psychological theories of group-based aggression and support the proposal that such theories are applicable for understanding gang-related violence. Aggr.

Therefore, we examine the SIP patterns of young adolescents characterized by their teachers and by their own reports as victims, bullies, bullies/victims, and neither bullies nor victims. The 105 adolescents participating in this study were asked to respond to hypothetical social scenarios in which a protagonist is either rebuffed or provoked by peers. The scenarios were ambiguous in nature and thus could have been processed in different ways. Indeed, distinctive processing patterns were found for each of these groups: victims tended to avoid challenging social situations while expecting others to be purposefully hostile or ignoring; bullies tended to interpret others as purposefully hostile and stated their desire to retaliate; bullies/victims showed patterns more similar to those of the bullies than the victims; and those who were neither victims nor bullies tended to view the same challenging social situations as non hostile and more likely to end well for them.

The current study uses an interactive video racing game to measure hostile attributions while children played against a presumed peer. A sample of 75 children, ages 10–13, used nonverbal and verbal procedures to respond to ambiguous provocation by their opponent. Hostile attributions were significantly positively related to parent‐rated reactive aggression, when controlling for proactive aggression. Hostile attributions using a nonverbal response procedure were negatively related to proactive aggression, when controlling for reactive aggression. Results suggest hostile attributions in real‐time occur quickly and simultaneously with social interaction, which differs from the deliberative, controlled appraisals measured with vignette‐based instruments. The relation between real‐time hostile attributions and reactive aggression could be accounted for by the impulsive response style that is characteristic of reactive aggression, whereas children exhibiting proactive aggression may be more deliberate and intentional in their responding, resulting in a negative relation with real‐time hostile attributions. These findings can be used both to identify children at risk for aggression and to enhance preventive interventions. Aggr. Behav. 40:409–420, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This study explored the possibility that an increase in state narcissism would foster aggressive responding by increasing anger and hostile attributional bias following unexpected provocation among 162 college students from China. We created a guided‐imagination manipulation to heighten narcissism and investigated its effects on anger, aroused hostile attribution bias, and aggressive responses following a provocation with a 2 (narcissism/neutral manipulation) × 2 (unexpected provocation/positive evaluation condition) between‐subjects design. We found that the manipulation did increase self‐reported state narcissism. The increase in state narcissism in turn heightened aggression, and this relation was mediated by increased anger. Regardless of the level of state narcissism, individuals were more aggressive after being provoked and this effect of provocation was mediated by hostile attributional bias. The findings indicate that narcissism can be temporarily heightened in a nonclinical sample of individuals, and that the effect of state narcissism on aggression is mediated by anger.

Yet, few studies have explored the association between physical, verbal, and indirect aggression using the 4‐facet model of psychopathy in community samples, and to date, no studies exist that test for male and female differences. The present study aimed to understand what facets of psychopathy predict aggressive behavior for men and women, while controlling for important risk factors, such as Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). Drawing from a large Bulgarian community sample ( N = 565), a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the use of the 4‐facet model of the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV; Hart et al., ). Hierarchical linear regressions revealed that physical aggression was predicted by affective and antisocial psychopathic traits, and ASPD. Verbal aggression was predicted by the interpersonal facet, and indirect aggression was predicted by the antisocial psychopathy facet and ASPD. Sex significantly moderated the associations among facets of psychopathy and physical and indirect aggression. Specifically, the affective facet was positively associated with physical aggression only for women, whereas the antisocial facet was positively associated with indirect aggression only for men. Results suggest that the 4‐facet model of psychopathy is sensitive to capture important similarities and differences between males and females when predicting forms of aggression in community samples. These findings underscore the importance of understanding how men and women differ in their risk‐factors for aggressive behavior, which will better inform violence interventions based on sex‐specific needs.",

Given the paucity of longitudinal explorations of this link, this study focused on the following two research questions: (Q1) Is pornography use during middle to late adolescence related to male adolescents’ self‐reported sexual aggressiveness; and (Q2) can personality traits and characteristics that have been associated with sexual aggression account for this presumed link? Using data from a six‐wave panel sample of 594 male Croatian high‐school sophomore students ( M age at baseline = 15.8 years, SD = 0.52), latent class and latent growth curve modeling were employed to answer these questions. There was a significant baseline difference in the frequency of pornography use between participants who reported no or marginal levels of sexual aggressiveness during the period under observation (20 months) and their peers who reported substantial sexual aggressiveness, with the former reporting significantly lower initial levels of pornography use compared to the latter. Controlling for personality characteristics did not cancel this association. In addition, bullying and reported peer pressure significantly predicted initial levels of pornography use, but not its subsequent change. With the controls omitted from the analysis, a slight average increase in pornography use was observed among adolescents who reported no or lowest levels of sexual aggressiveness. In contrast, pornography use decreased somewhat among their peers who reported moderate sexual aggressiveness. Insights from this study can contribute to school‐based sexual violence prevention programs, as well as inform recently proposed pornography literacy programs which aim to assist adolescents in navigating the increasingly sexually explicit online environment.",

Data were collected from 550 young Dutch adolescents, who filled out multiple questionnaires. Findings showed that the link between a lack of empathic concern and proactive aggression is partly mediated and moderated by agentic goals. The moderation analyses showed that the predictive value of a lack of empathic concern with regard to proactive aggression was greater when adolescents reported a stronger desire to be dominant in social situations with peers.

However, few studies have examined harsh parenting as the context for the effect of early pubertal timing. Even fewer studies have tested the interactive effect of early pubertal timing and positive parenting on aggressive behavior. In this study, we tested the proposition that early pubertal timing, contrary to the general conception of it as a vulnerability, indexed susceptibility, and thus early maturing individuals were affected more by their environment in a \"for better and for worse\" manner. The sample consisted of 411 community-recruited youth aged 11-12 years (51% boys, 80% African Americans). Participants reported Tanner Stages of pubertal development, aggressive behavior and harsh parenting practice of their parents. Puberty scores were standardized with groups of the same age, sex, and ethnicity, and those that scored the top one-third were defined as early maturing individuals. Parents reported youth's aggressive behavior and their parenting practices towards the youth, including harsh parenting and positive parenting. Early pubertal timing significantly moderated the relationship between harsh/positive parenting and aggressive behavior. Specifically, harsh parenting was positively associated with aggressive behavior to a larger degree among early maturing individuals than among on-time/late-maturing individuals. Positive parenting was inversely associated with aggressive behavior but only among early maturing individuals. This study is the first to document support for early pubertal timing as susceptibility to the environmental influences in relation to aggressive behavior. Theoretical and intervention implications are discussed.",

This study investigated the relationship between sibling bullying perpetration and victimization in early adolescence and high-risk behavior in early adulthood. Sibling bullying was assessed at 12 years in 6,988 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a birth cohort based in the UK and high-risk behavioral outcomes were assessed at 18-20 years. Frequent sibling bullying perpetration predicted antisocial behavior (OR = 1.74; 95%CI, 1.38-2.20), while frequent sibling bullying victimization increased the odds of nicotine dependence (OR = 2.87; 95%CI, 1.55-5.29), even after accounting for peer bullying and parent maltreatment. Categorical analysis revealed that particularly bullies and bully-victims were at risk of developing high-risk behavior. Finally, this study found that adolescents who were involved in bullying perpetration across multiple contexts (home and school) had the highest odds of reporting antisocial behavior (OR = 3.05; 95%CI, 2.09-4.44), criminal involvement (OR = 2.12; 95%CI, 1.23-3.66), and illicit drug use (OR = 2.11; 95%CI, 1.44-3.08). Findings from this study suggest that sibling bullying perpetration may be a marker of or a contributory factor along the developmental trajectory to antisocial behavior problems.

The first two hypotheses were examined in Study 1 (1,035 Dutch adolescents, M age = 14.15) and the third hypothesis was examined in Study 2 (601 Dutch adolescents, M age = 12.92). Results from regression analyses showed that those higher in bullying were not more likely to overestimate their likeability. However, they were more likely than others to find being popular more important than being liked. Moreover, those higher in bullying were more likely to endorse the belief that the victimized student or the other classmates would have disliked a bullying protagonist (in vignettes of hypothetical bullying incidents) before any bullying started. These findings suggest that adolescent bullying perpetrators may not be deterred by the costs of bullying in terms of likeability, possibly because they do not value likeability that much (Hypothesis 2), and because they believe they hardly have any likeability to lose (Hypothesis 3).",

    "abstract": "Abstract School violence is a significant public health concern that occurs in many forms. Physical aggression can cause serious bodily injury and long‐term negative effects, and both teachers and students experience significant rates of physical aggression. There are few studies examining teachers’ experiences of physical aggression. Studies that go beyond prevalence are limited, and we know little about the triggers and consequences that surround these incidents. This qualitative investigation used an antecedent‐behavior‐consequence (A‐B‐C) framework to understand how incidents of physical aggression directed toward teachers unfold. The sample included 193 elementary and secondary teachers who completed an anonymous, online survey and described events leading up to and following their experiences with physical aggression. Using conventional content analysis, we identified common antecedents, such as breaking up fights, discipline, and directives, and common consequences, such as student removal, school staff involvement, positive outcomes, and inaction. Further analyses revealed seven common A‐B‐C patterns among physical aggression incidents that are highlighted and discussed. Utility of the A‐B‐C framework for teacher‐directed violence is described, along with implications for research, practice, and policy. Exploring the context surrounding incidents of physical aggression directed against teachers provides useful information for violence prevention and interventions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the extensive evaluation of school‐based interventions for bullying, victimization remains a significant problem in schools. Bullying victimization is significantly predicted by contextual (school‐related) factors. As a consequence whole‐school programs have been commonly used to prevent and reduce bullying victimization. Evidence also points to individual risk factors (such as emotional distress) in predicting victimization, yet programs to prevent bullying victimization by changing these individual risks are far less developed. Few studies have approximated “real‐world” implementation conditions in their trials. The current effectiveness trial evaluated the combination of a whole‐school program designed to prevent bullying perpetration and victimization together with a targeted intervention for at‐risk students, teaching them individual and dyadic strategies to reduce their anxiety and manage victimization, allowing schools some latitude to implement programs as they typically would. Students from Grades 3 and 4 ( N = 8,732) across 135 schools were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: combined intervention; whole‐school intervention only; individual intervention only; and care as usual. Victimization decreased significantly and similarly across all four conditions at 12 and 24 months following baseline. Similar reductions and failure to discriminate conditions were found on other key constructs: anxiety; bullying perpetration; and depression. Possible reasons for the failure to demonstrate victimization prevention differences and lessons learned from this large, effectiveness trial are considered.",

The present cross-cultural study (N = 398) extended these findings to sexual aggression (i.e., marital rape) by comparing participants from a culture that emphasizes honor (Turkey) and participants from cultures without strong honor traditions (Germany and Britain). Turkish participants blamed the victim and exonerated the perpetrator more than did German and British participants. In all cultural groups, participants blamed the victim and exonerated the perpetrator more when the husband's reputation was threatened than in the absence of such threat, and in all cultural groups, men blamed the victim and exonerated the perpetrator more than women. Yet, the effect of masculine reputation threat and this pattern of gender differences were somewhat more pronounced among Turkish than German or British participants. Results exploring the predictive role of honor norms at the individual level beyond rape myth acceptance and traditional gender role attitudes revealed that honor norms were the primary predictor of rape perceptions and blame attributions in Turkey (an honor culture), but not in Germany and Britain (dignity cultures) where rape myth acceptance was the strongest predictor. These results provide insights into the cultural factors influencing marital rape judgments in ways that may undermine victim's well-being and fair handling of rape cases, and highlight the domains most urgently in need of potential intervention.",

Though reasons for this dramatic form of violence are multifaceted and diverse, one possibility is that violence beyond what is required to win a conflict is a method by which violent actors communicate to others that they are formidable opponents. The formidability representation hypothesis predicts that formidability is cognitively represented using the dimensions of envisioned bodily size and strength. We tested the informational ramifications of gruesome acts using two vignette studies depicting individuals who either did or did not grievously damage the corpse of a deceased foe. Participants rated the individual's height, bodily size, and strength, as well as his aggressiveness, motivation, and the capacity to vanquish opponents in future conflicts. Results indicate that, as predicted, committing gruesome acts of violence enhances perceptions of formidability as measured both by envisioned bodily size and strength and expectations regarding the outcomes of agonistic conflicts. Moreover, the gruesome actor was perceived as more aggressive and more motivated to overcome his enemies, and this mediated the increase in conceptualized size and strength. These results both provide further evidence for the formidability representation hypothesis and support the thesis that overtly grisly violence is tactically employed, in part, because it conveys information about the perpetrator's formidability.",

(2014) were the first to show an association between male facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) and physical aggression and fighting ability in professional mixed-martial-arts fighters. Here, we re-examined this relationship by replicating (using all original measures) and extending (using 23 new variables related to fighting performance) Zilioli et al. (2014) in a statistically well-powered sample of 520 fighters using automatic and manual measures of the fWHR involving both eyelid and eyebrow landmarks, used interchangeably in previous reports (Studies 1-2). Most importantly, we successfully replicated Zilioli et al.'s (2014) central finding that fighters' fWHR, when manually calculated using the eyebrow landmark, predicted their fighting success (p = .004, controlling for body mass index and total fights). Consistent with past criticisms of using fight rather than fighter data to examine fighting success, which have argued that individual fights can be suddenly and unexpectedly determined and do not capture an individual's overall ability to succeed, Study 3 (N = 1367 fights) found no association between fWHR and singular victories. Studies 1-3 showed continual evidence that larger fWHRs were associated with grappling abilities, even after controlling for demographic and allometric factors. Strikingly, Study 3 discovered associations between all fWHR measures and grappling skill that remained robust before and after controlling for 17 different control variables. We discuss that grappling, or the act of taking down an opponent, involves a more aggressive, close-combat approach than does striking. Combined, these results offer additional support for the argument that fWHR may have been shaped by sexual selection.",

There was a strong positive association between the Hostility subscale of the AQ and psychological and physical symptoms. The nature of this connection was discussed. It was argued that the Hostility subscale measures some unique aspect of aggression that is not incorporated by the Physical Aggression, Verbal Aggression, or Anger subscales of the AQ. As expected, the AQ scales correlated significantly with trait anger, social desirability, and age. Furthermore, staff ratings of physical violence, verbal aggression, anger, and negative attitude were obtained for each subject. Correlations between the AQ scales and these ratings were low.

It is suggested here that such actions, while both tragic and frightening, are only a small part of a much larger problem of workplace aggression—efforts by individuals to harm others with whom they work or the organizations in which they are employed. The present study investigated two major hypotheses with respect to such aggression: 1) contrary to what media reports suggest, most aggression occurring in work settings is verbal, indirect, and passive rather than physical, direct, and active; 2) recent changes in many organizations (e.g., downsizing, increased workforce diversity) have generated conditions that may contribute to the occurrence of workplace aggression. A survey of 178 employed persons provided partial support for both predictions. Verbal and passive forms of aggression were rated as more frequent by participants than physical and active forms of aggression. In addition, the greater the extent to which several changes had occurred recently in participants' organizations, the greater the incidence of workplace aggression they reported. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Data from a community‐based longitudinal study of 481 men and women were examined. Specifically, we examined relations among substance use and conduct problems through the 10 th grade, lifetime symptoms of substance abuse and dependence, adult symptoms of antisocial personality disorder through age 21, and a measure of the FFM. Results were virtually identical for men and women. Personality traits accounted for relatively large proportions of the variance in ASB and SUM with R 2 ranging from .19 for early SUM to .30 for early ASB. Additionally, personality profiles of the four measures were highly similar, with similarity coefficients ranging from .87 to .97. Finally, the inclusion of common personality correlates reduced the relations between the four measures by between 13% (early ASB and SUM) and 29% (early and later SUM). It is concluded that personality, particularly the dimensions of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, is important to understanding ASB and SUM. Aggr.

Parents were classified as exhibiting excessively punitive parenting based on home observations and parent reports of the use of physical punishment strategies other than spanking. We hypothesized that the levels of child coerciveness, parent irritability, and family stress would be mediated by disruptions in parent discipline in predicting excessively punitive parenting toward the child. Structural equation methodology was employed to test the hypothesized and alternative models. Results consistently supported the powerful mediational role of discipline in the hypothesized model over alternative models that posited separate, direct effects of child coerciveness, parent irritability, and parent stress on excessively punitive parenting behavior. Results are discussed in terms of the need for further examination of parenting behavior, as well as parents' perceptions of and affective reactions to parent-child interactions in the occurrence of physical abuse.

In Study I, the students alos completed a standard aggression questionnaire and one concerning masculine values to assess whether measures of physical aggressiveness were associated with traditional masculine role norms. There was a weak association with physical aggressiveness but not with reported fights. Students with traditionally masculine interests did report more fights. In Study II, both subsamples showed significant correlations between a masculine role subscale involving toughness from this study were primarily assessed in relation to hyphotheses derived from Darwinian sexual selection theory: that fights between young men are likely to arise from threats to personal integrity and status, women, and resoureces; that fights will be more related to social status and be more damageing among the unemployed men than the students. In line with these predictions, insults were a potent cause of fights in both samples, but public humiliation was a more common reason among the unemployed men, Money or property was more often a reason for fighting among the unemployed men also showed higher levels of anger and physical aggression (but not verbal aggression) on a standard aggression questionnaire. Other differences included the location of the fight, but there were no significant differences between the two samples in whether or not a fight had occured in the last 5 years. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

We anticipated that spontaneous processing conditions would be more revealing of aggressive/nonaggressive differences than would conditions that prompt deliberate inference processes. We used a cued-recall paradigm. Aggressive and nonaggressive subjects were instructed to memorize sentences that were open to either hostile or nonhostile interpretations. Sentence recall was then cued by either hostile dispositional terms or by words that were linked semantically to the element of the sentences. Within the spontaneous inference condition, semantic cues prompted twice as much recall as hostile cues among nonaggressive subjects, whereas dispositional cues aided recall more than semantic cues among aggressive subjects. As predicted, within the delinerate inference conditions there were no aggressive/nonaggressive differences. The nature of spontaneous vs. deliberate inferential processes and the advantages of spontaneous inference paradigms for testing predictions about schema-based processing in aggression are discussed. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines whether, in a male prison, the subjective experience of crowding increases the likelihood that events are perceived as aggressive in nature, and whether the protagonists involved are viewed as more hostile, malevolent, and aggressive. In addition, this paper also examines the possible mediating effects of stress, arousal, and psychological well‐being on two hypothesised relationships. First, these mediating factors are examined for the link between individuals' personal space preferences and their perceived level of crowding. Second, these factors are examined for the link between perceived crowding and interpretations of an aggressive event. Such associations may help to explain why crowding and aggression are linked within a social interactionist perspective. The results confirmed previous findings that crowding is linked to increases in arousal and stress, and a reduction in psychological well‐being. This study also found, however, that those inmates who experienced crowding were also more likely to interpret behaviour as aggressive and violent. This relationship was not mediated by arousal, stress, or psychological well‐being. However, these factors were found to partially operate in the relationship between personal space preferences and the experience of subjective crowding. The implications of this study for social interactionist explanations of the link between crowding and prison violence are offered. Aggr. Behav. 30:273–283, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

This study examines how expectancies for alcohol‐induced aggression and dispositional aggression moderate the link between alcohol consumption and alcohol‐related violence, building on previous studies that have employed limited measures of alcohol‐related violence and included few women. A sample of 212 men and women reported their alcohol consumption, alcohol‐aggression expectancies, dispositional aggression, and incidents of alcohol‐related aggressive acts. Alcohol‐aggression expectancies and quantity of alcohol consumed interacted to predict alcohol‐related aggression. Alcohol‐aggression expectancies covaried with alcohol‐related aggressive acts, particularly in heavier drinkers. Dispositional aggression also correlated with alcohol‐related aggression among heavier drinkers. These results help identify that alcohol might increase aggression only among heavy drinkers who expect alcohol to increase aggression or who are dispositionally aggressive. Aggr.

    "abstract": "The play fighting of many mammals involves the nonserious use of behavior patterns derived from serious fighting. A major question of theoretical importance has been that of how, given this overlap in patterns of behavior, the animals can distinguish between playful and nonplayful intent. One proposed solution is that animals use play signals to inform each other about the playful intent of their actions. The most widely reported play signal amongst primates is the open mouth play face. The manner in which this so-called signal functions is based on correlational evidence, with most reports simply noting its presence or absence in a given species. This study involved a detailed video-based analysis of the occurrence of open mouths during the play fighting of three species of primates. One captive troop each of ring-tailed lemurs, black-handed spider monkeys, and patas monkeys was used. By examining all open mouths in the context of the species-typical style of play fighting, several conclusions were empirically verified. 1) Most open mouths occur as a functionally necessary precursor for biting. 2) Some open mouths occur as a defensive threat which deters further contact. 3) The residual open mouths which may function as contact promoting play signals, constituted about 20–25% of all open mouths by the lemurs and patas monkeys, but less than 5% for spider monkeys. These species differences appeared to arise from two causes. Firstly, the spider monkeys used another signal, the head shake, in situations where lemurs and patas monkeys used open mouths. Secondly, the style of play fighting greatly influenced the frequency and duration of open mouths. This was most marked in the face-to-face combat style of patas monkeys. These findings show that comparative studies of the occurrence and function of play signals need to take into account species-typical styles of playful combat. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Although a considerable body of experimental research supports the contention that alcohol facilitates aggression, some investigators have argued that these findings cannot be generalized to actual occurrences of aggression. Moreover, controversy continues concerning whether expectancies supporting alcohol's influence on aggression moderate the relationship. The present study is an event‐based examination of the relationship between alcohol consumption, personality characteristics, contextual variables, and the occurrence and severity of male‐to‐male bar aggression. Men (n=190) who experienced either a physically aggressive episode or an incident of threat in a bar were assessed with respect to stable individual difference factors, such as personality factors, trait anger, and alcohol‐aggression expectancies. The participants were also interviewed about the circumstances surrounding the most severe episode of bar aggression or threat that occurred in the past year. Logisitic regression analyses indicated that while alcohol consumption did not predict the occurrence of aggression, heavy alcohol consumption by the participant and the opponent was associated with aggression severity and physical harm, and that this relationship was present after controlling for personality and situational factors. The belief that alcohol was a cause of aggression was associated with the occurrence of aggression, but it was not related to severity or harm, and did not appear to moderate the alcohol‐aggression relationship. These results suggest that alcohol expectancies may facilitate the occurrence of aggression. However, the results also support the contention that alcohol use may contribute to the severity of aggression occuring in bar contexts. Aggr. Behav. 29:346–365, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc..",

Responses of 416 college students revealed that males were more likely to consider a female exhibiting physical aggression or a male hurting another person as anger-provoking, whereas females were more likely to mention condescending or insensitive behaviors from either sex, verbal aggression from a female, and physical aggression from a male. Physical aggression and hurting another provoked more anger when they came from a male, whereas dishonesty from a female evoked more anger. Females also felt that insensitive and condescending behaviors were worse when they came from a male. Most of the verbal insults were sexual in nature, with few sex of subject differences. However, it was considered worse for women to be called promiscuous; for men to be called sexually inadequate, worthless, or cowardly; for women to call men an obscene name; and for people to be called homosexual by a same sex speaker. These results are consistent both with previous research and with traditional gender role beliefs suggesting that women are more upset by condescending behaviors and that women's promiscuity, as well as men's aggression toward women, hurting another, sexual inadequacy, and cowardice, are viewed particularly negatively. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Aggression toward unfamiliar male “intruders” during 10-min tests was low among nonpregnant, nonlactating females and during the first 10 days of gestation. Frequency of attack on intruders increased moderately but significantly by Gestation Day 16 (G16; Experiment 1) or G21 (Experiment 2), a prepartum phenomenon not previously reported in laboratory rats. Levels of aggression were highest, however, during the first 9 days of lactation, when attacks averaged more than 6 per 10-min session. Attacks declined sharply in frequency after L14 and by L24 did not exceed levels observed among nonpregnant females. Experiment 3 examined the importance of the test site (home cage with nest and pups, if any, vs unfamiliar cage without nest or pups) to agonistic behavior associated with pregnancy and lactation. Late pregnant females tested in a novel cage were not aggressive; however, females tested shortly after delivering their pups were highly aggressive, averaging over four attacks per 5-min session. In novel cage tests frequency of attack remained high through L4 but declined significantly by L7. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal aggression at its onset is primarily under hormonal control, but becomes increasingly dependent upon external factors, presumably pup stimulation, during the postpartum period.",

Data on the HCR–20 in UK samples is limited. We examined the predictive validity of the HCR–20 in relation to post‐discharge outcomes in male medium secure patients who had a history of violent offending. HCR–20 scores (omitting the psychopathy item) at the point of discharge were rated in 70 violent patients released into the community using case file data. Relationships between post‐discharge outcomes (reconviction, readmission, self/collateral reports of violence) over a minimum two‐year follow‐up period were rated blind to the HCR–20 score and examined using a variety of risk prediction statistics. HCR–20 score did not predict reconviction, but was a significant predictor of readmission and self/collateral reports of violence. Subscale analyses indicated that all subscales had predictive validity. High scores on the Historical items were better at predicting who would have poor outcome. High scores on the Clinical and Risk scales were better at predicting how long an individual remained at liberty in the community following discharge. The findings suggest that the HCR–20, without the psychopathy rating, is a reasonably robust predictor of self‐reported violence and readmission in medium secure services. Our finding that it did not predict violent recidivism reflects the utility of this measure in the management of risk in violent patients discharged to the community. Aggr.

This analysis suggests that a variety of specific defenses, such as flight, movement arrest, and defensive threat and attack, are most characteristic of fear to a present, discrete, threat stimulus while risk assessment patterns coupled with the inhibition of nondefensive behavior are the central features of anxiety to potential threat. In a Fear/Defense Test Battery (F/DTB) and an Anxiety/Defense Test Battery (A/DTB) designed to elicit and measure such behaviors, benzodiazepines, 5-HT1A agonists, and ethanol produced very different behavior profiles, with diazepam in particular having relatively little effect in the F/DTB but sharply and specifically reducing risk assessment in the A/DTB. The specific defensive behaviors for which neuroanatomic and neurochemical substrates have been sought appear to show substantial differences. These analyses suggest that defense comprises a number of systems which can be differentiated on stimulus, organismic, and response (behavioral) dimensions. The potency of these reactions and their elicitation by a wide variety of threatening stimuli and situations suggest that they may appear in human as well as animal behavior, with the animal models providing homologies to a variety of human psychopathological conditions.",

However, substantial variation of behavioral traits between mouse populations has been also evidenced. Agonistic behavior of laboratory-born house mice from five commensal populations (Mus musculus musculus: central Czech Republic, Mus musculus domesticus: Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, and natural Mus m. musculus/domesticus hybrids from the Czech part of the hybrid zone) and five non-commensal populations of M. m. domesticus (C. Syria, E. Syria, Jordan, Iran, Libya) was studied. Dyadic interactions in a neutral cage were performed and the effects of sex and population on time spent by agonistic behavior evaluated. In all studied populations, the male-male interactions were more agonistic than the female-female ones. Male-male behavior gradually increased from the least agonistic population of M. m. musculus from Central Europe to the Near East populations of M. m. domesticus exhibiting the highest scores of agonistic behavior. Between-population differences were even stronger when female-female encounters were considered. While females of commensal populations belonging to both M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus were tolerant of each other, those coming from non-commensal populations of M. m. domesticus were highly agonistic, reaching even the level of aggression between the females of some aboriginal mouse species. This phenomenon may be attributed to increased competition for food in non-commensal populations when compared to commensal ones supplied by superabundant resources. Social behavior of house mice, therefore, appears to be pliable rather than rigid and species specific. It can be changed rapidly according to ecological needs and such adaptability allows house mice to colonize various habitats. Aggr. Behav. 31:283–293, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

This study used an experimental paradigm to examine the effects of a moderate alcohol dose, alcohol‐related beliefs, and victim response on men's self‐reported likelihood of committing sexual aggression. A community sample of male social drinkers ( N =84) participated in an experiment in which they read an eroticized rape depiction after completing an alcohol administration protocol. The stimulus story varied whether the victim, who initially expressed unwillingness to engage in sexual activity, expressed pleasure or distress in response to the man physically forcing her to perform several explicit sex acts. A path analytic model illustrated that participants' self‐reported likelihood of behaving like the sexual aggressor in the story was directly related to their own sexual arousal. Heightened sexual arousal was reported by participants who had consumed alcohol, those who read the victim‐pleasure story, and those who believed that drinking women are sexually vulnerable. Results suggest that sexual arousal to violent pornography, as influenced by acute alcohol intoxication and other factors, may be an important component of men's perceptions of their own sexual aggression likelihood.

Similarly, analysis of social investigation and allog-rooming, while revealing the ears to be important targets, do not show the cheeks to be targets in these behaviors.

Testosterone levels were regressed on factors typically found to be related to male satisfaction with family life at mid‐life: marital satisfaction, parent‐adolescent communication, amount of emotional expressiveness, and androgynous characteristics; recent positive and negative stressors and trait anxiety were statistically controlled. Results of step‐wise multiple regression analysis indicated that low levels of testosterone were significantly (R = .34, P &lt; .01) related to enhanced marital and parental relationships and androgynous behaviors; however, emotional expressiveness was significantly related to high levels of testosterone.",

This study extends previous work to show how expectancies for alcohol-induced aggression and dispositional rumination moderate the link between alcohol consumption and alcohol-related aggression and hostility in a sample of 285 men and women. Alcohol-aggression expectancies and quantity of alcohol interacted to predict alcohol-related hostility and aggression. Trait rumination moderated the effect of alcohol consumption on aggressive acts. Finally, women who ruminated were more likely to report alcohol-related aggression than were men who ruminated. These results suggest that alcohol expectancies for aggression and rumination constitute two important cognitive facilitators of alcohol-related aggression and hostility, and that gender plays an important role in these relations.",

Self-reported trait physical aggression also rose after September 11. Attitudes towards penal code violence (PCV) became more positive immediately after September 11, but were somewhat reduced a year afterward. A two-wave within subjects study revealed that war attitudes became even more positive at 2 months post-September 11.

In BO, NAS, and TO, where levels of 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) were detectable with our analytical methods, the increase of this metabolite suggested an increased DA release. Repeatedly defeated mice (3 days) sacrificed 24 hr after the last defeat experience presented significant increase 3-4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in the HYP and a significant decrease in DA levels in the FC, showing only minor effects on DA metabolism 24 hr after the last defeat experience. Finally, mice subjected to three daily defeats and then confronted with environmental cues related to their defeat experiences presented an increase of DOPAC, homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3-MT in the BO, NAS, and TO and an increase of DOPAC and HVA in the HYP. Other brain areas did not show significant changes in DA metabolism compared with undefeated mice exposed to the same environmental cues. Taken together these results strongly suggest that changes in DA metabolism produced by defeat in some brain areas are elicited by environmental cues previously paired with the experience of being defeated.",

Using the same experimental protocol, we assessed the relative effect of intruder sex and time since parturition on the frequency of maternal aggression in Long-Evans rats and CFW mice. Females were studied for 2 consecutive cycles of pregnancy and lactation. During the first lactation, aggression was tested 2 times per week for 3 weeks in order to select animals that attacked at least once. During the second lactation, both pup care and aggressive behavior were assessed in detail. Testing occurred twice in each lactation week, with postpartum days 1–7, 8–14, and 15–21 considered weeks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Maternal behavior towards 3 pups was observed for 5 minutes, followed by a confrontation with an intruder. Lactating females encountered female intruders once per week, and male intruders in the alternate weekly test. The same behaviors were measured in the 2 species, except for the tail rattle exhibited by mice and the aggressive posture shown by rats. Lactating rats and mice show similar decreases in pup care behavior as lactation progresses in time; yet the factors associated with peak levels of aggression differ between species. In Long-Evans rats, female intruders receive more attacks, threats, and aggressive postures than males. Frequency of attack bite and sideways threat declines in each passing week of lactation. Lactating mice are more aggressive toward male intruders throughout the lactation period. Mice still attack and threaten during the third week of lactation, but less often in comparison to the first week. Therefore, peak levels of aggression vary in mice and rats both as a function of intruder sex and lactation week.",

This divider permitted constant visual, olfactory, auditory, and some tactile contact. The responses of individually tested, group‐housed males were recorded when half of the substrate in a test box was treated with either water or one of the four urine types; the other half remained untreated. Significant preferences for the untreated half were found when the urine of winners or losers housed in individual metabolism cages or that of pair‐housed dominants was used as the test stimulus. On the other hand, neither water nor the urine of cohabiting subordinate males was avoided. The present findings confirmed our earlier reports that the urine of dominant male mice was aversive, whereas that of their cohabiting subordinate partners was not. They also identified Sawyer's [1978] procedure of housing winners and losers in individual cages, with the consequent interruption of social contact as the likely reason for his failure to replicate our reports that subordinate male urine lacked aversive properties. The territorial implications of the aversive factor and other urinary signals are discussed.",

Intracerebroventricular infusions of AVP and a V1a antagonist were used in sexually naive males of two mouse species, the monogamous and highly aggressive California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) and the non-monogamous and less aggressive white-footed mouse (P. leucopus), to begin testing the interaction between the social system of a species and the effects of AVP on aggression. Two testing conditions, the resident-intruder aggression test (R-I) and the neutral arena aggression test, were used because they may differ in function and underlying biological mechanisms. In the R-I test, administration of the antagonist lengthened attack latencies in California mice. In contrast, blocking V1a receptors did not alter attack latencies in the R-I test in white-footed mice or in the neutral arena aggression test in both species. AVP also did not alter aggression in either species in either behavioral test. Overall, these results suggest that AVP may be more likely to be associated with offensive aggression as measured in the R-I test than with neutral arena aggression and that the effects of AVP manipulations may differ between monogamous and non-monogamous rodents.

    "abstract": "Mental pain has been hypothesized to reflect psychological adaptation designed by selection to detect and cope with the occurrence of social problems that reduced individuals inclusive fitness in human evolutionary history. According to the hypothesis, mental pain is brought about by social tragedies in the lives of individuals and focuses an individual's attention on the events surrounding the pain, promoting correction of the pain-causing events and their avoidance in the future. The hypothesis applied to rape victims argues that in human evolutionary history raped females had increased fitness as a result of mental pain, because the pain forced them to focus their attention on the fitness-reducing circumstances surrounding rape, which are discussed. Some of the hypothesis' predictions about the psychological pain of rape victims are examined using a data set of 790 rape victims who were interviewed about their psychological traumatization within five days after the assault. Earlier analyses of these data have indicated that, as predicted, both a victim's age and marital status are proximate causes of the magnitude of psychological pain following rape: Reproductive-aged women appear to have been more severely traumatized by rape than older women or girls and married women more than unmarried women. The analyses herein indicate that, as predicted, reproductive-aged women are more likely to be victims of force and/or violence during rape than are older women or young girls. When force and/or violence was controlled, reproductive-aged women were still more psychologically traumatized by rape than were either older women or young girls. The results suggest that the psychology that regulates mental pain processes information about age and mateship status in the event of a woman's rape. The analyses reported here indicate that stranger rapes are more forceful and violent than either friend or family-member rapes.",

Their effects on hypothalamically induced aggression, switch-off behaviour, and locomotion were investigated. A number of these animals were also tested for territorial intermale aggression in order to compare electrically induced and spontaneous aggression. Large lesions resulted in an increase of the current threshold to induce aggression by hypo-thalamic stimulation. Smaller, but still quite large, lesions decreased the threshold current for hypothalamic aggression. After the operation a decrease in the threshold for switch-off was present, both in the experimental and the control group. Current thresholds for locomotion were decreased after the lesions only in the experimental group. Spontaneous aggression was temporarily decreased after the lesion. No indication was found that other behavioural elements of the animal were distorted by the lesion. The parallel between the effects on spontaneous and electrically induced aggression makes it attractive to ascribe a role to the neural circuit of hypothalamus and central gray in territorial aggression. However, even with large lesions the animals were still capable of fighting, hence the central gray is not indispensable. An attempt was made to explain the differential effects that differently sized central gray lesions have on hypothalamic aggression.",

High correlations among the aggressive driving inventories provided evidence for the convergent validity, but a confirmatory factor analyses raised questions about the discriminant validity of aggressive driving inventories. The inventories did not attain significance in hierarchical analyses of traffic violations that controlled for gender, driving experience, and measures of trait aggression.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aggressive players who intentionally cause injury to their opponents are common in many sports, particularly collision sports such as Rugby Union. Although some acts of aggression fall within the rules (sanctioned), others do not (unsanctioned), with the latter tending to be less acceptable than the former. This study attempts to identify characteristics of players who are more likely to employ unsanctioned methods in order to injure an opponent. Male Rugby Union players completed questionnaires assessing aggressiveness, anger, past aggression, professionalization, and athletic identity. Players were assigned to one of two groups based on self‐reported past unsanctioned aggression. Results indicated that demographic variables (e.g., age, playing position, or level of play) were not predictive of group membership. Measures of aggressiveness and professionalization were significant predictors; high scores on both indicated a greater probability of reporting the use of unsanctioned aggressive force for the sole purpose of causing injury or pain. In addition, players who had been taught how to execute aggressive illegal plays without detection were also more likely to report using excessive force to injure an opponent. Results provide further support that highly professionalized players may be more likely to use methods outside the constitutive rules of Rugby Union in order to intentionally injure their opponents. Results are discussed within the context of the increasing win‐at‐all‐cost attitude that is becoming more prevalent in sport and its implications for youth athletes. Aggr.

Aggression could be induced from 10 of 112 electrodes implanted in the central gray; the other electrodes elicited either locomotion, vocalization, jump, or \"alarm-like reactions.\" The morphology of the induced aggression was similar to the morphology of the hypothalamically induced aggression, though it was often accompanied with motor disturbances and was less intense. Hypothalamic stimulation was combined with simultaneous central gray stimulation in rats with electrodes both in the hypothalamus and in the central gray. Hypothalamic thresholds for aggression could be lowered by this stimulation of the central gray, even when no aggressive responses were observed during central gray stimulation alone. This suggests that, although aggression is not manifest, electrical stimulation may activate neural tissue involved in aggressive behavior. It is concluded that in rats central gray and hypothalamus are part of the same neural network mediating intraspecific aggression.",

In Study 2, high prejudiced subjects were confronted with a competitor who behaved in a nonaggressive fashion.

In Study 3, high prejudiced subjects competed against an opponent who communicated nonaggressive intentions. The subjects behaved in a nonaggressive manner toward both the black and the white target.

To investigate this relationship further we used amino acid mixtures designed to raise or lower the levels of the 5HT precursor, tryptophan. Normal male subjects were given tryptophan-depleted, balanced, or tryptophan-supplemented ammo acid mixtures and tested for aggression 5 hours later. The balanced amino acid mixture served as a control for the tryptophan depletion and supplementation. Testing for aggression was done using the Buss paradigm in which subjects deliver electric shocks to a (nonexistent) partner in response to stimulus tones. Duration and intensity of shock delivered were the measures of aggression, while responsivity to the stimulus tones was the measure of perceptual sensitivity. Neither tryptophan supplementation nor tryptophan depletion had any effect on these measures of aggression or perceptual sensitivity. We conclude that raising or lowering the synthesis of brain 5HT through alterations in tryptophan availability does not influence aggression in normal males as measured by the Buss task.",

Two blind-to-condition raters assessed the frequency of participants' aggressive verbalizations (insults, aggressive threats, belligerent provocations) articulated during anger arousal. Aggressivity was assessed using a standard measure of dispositional aggression.

We explored whether levels of student victimization by school staff (teachers, principals, secretaries, janitors, etc.) have changed between 1998, 1999, 2002, and 2005, and whether patterns of group differences (gender, age, and cultural groups) were replicated across those four points in time. We employed representative samples stratified by ethnic affiliation and school levels. In 1998, there were 15,916 4th–11th grade students from 232 schools; in 1999, 16,414 4th–11th grade students from 239 schools; in 2002, 21,577 4th–11th grade students from 410 schools and in 2005, 27,316 4th–11th grade students from 526 schools across Israel. Overall, the results reveal that for the entire student population in Israel reports of victimization are quite similar across the four waves of data collection. Levels of physical victimization were consistently higher among boys and Arab students, but other group differences were less consistent, especially with regard to differences between age groups.

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim was to investigate a follow‐up study based on hormonal, physical, and psychological parameters among rugby players who trained during a whole season interspersed with competitions on an international level. Fitness or reciprocally tiredness as well as competitive anxiety were evaluated, respectively, using the French Society for Sports Medicine (SFMS) and the sport competition anxiety test (SCAT) questionnaires. In this study, SFMS and SCAT scores increased respectively over the competitive season. The SFMS score revealed a state of relative tiredness at the end of the season, highlighted by a slight decrement in physical performances. The SCAT score changes are related to the competition context and therefore increased accordingly to the importance of the competition stake. We analyzed the corticotrope and the gonadotrope axis before (T 1 ), and at the end of the national and international rugby season (T 2 ). Training did not affect the resting salivary cortisol (Csal) levels, but induced a decrease in resting testosterone (Tsal) values, resulting in a dropped T / C ratio. Competition, in both periods (T 1 –T 2 ), provoked a significant increase in Csal levels, but the Tsal responses depended on the match stake. Their concentrations increased when the competition generated an important stress and decreased when the psychological conditions remained relatively stable. SFMS is preferentially correlated with resting Csal levels and T / C values measured at 08:00 hr but not with Tsal. SCAT is highly correlated with competitive Csal and Tsal concentrations measured before and after the matches. Aggr. Behav. 34:623–632, 2008. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study analyzes violence against personnel in the emergency wards of all 25 general hospitals in Israel using a self‐report questionnaire ( N =2,356). Informed by the routine activity theory, the hypotheses related to the major concepts of this approach: exposure, target suitability, guarding and proximity to offenders. A General Exposure to Violence Index (GEVI) was constructed, based on the participants' reports about type and frequency of their victimization to violence during the preceding year. The multiple regression analysis for explaining the GEVI was composed of 15 independent variables relating to participants' professional and personal characteristics as well as to structural features of hospitals. As predicted, higher exposure to violence was related to security or nursing staff and positions of authority; high weekly workload; working in a profession other than that of training; inability of coping with verbal violence; having no access to an emergency button, and working in settings restricting the number of accompanying persons to one only. Unexpectedly, previous training in coping with violence was related to higher victimization. Younger age, male gender and being of European/American origin (mainly from the former Soviet Union) was also related to higher risk of victimization. The results support the utility of the routine activities approach in explaining differences in emergency ward personnel victimization. The findings also indicate, however, the need to add domain‐specific contextual analyses to this approach to reach a fuller understanding of the behaviors under discussion. Implications of the finding to coping with violence against emergency ward personnel are discussed, and suggestions are put forward for further study in this field. Aggr.

In addition, an attitude test was presented which discriminated between the two highest of Kohlberg's levels of moral reasoning [1969]. The subjects were a very varied group of 83 adults (aged 17–68 years) from municipal evening courses in Finland. Aggression was most approved when it was given altruistic purpose. Self-defense was rated as the second highest justification for aggression. Aggression was found least legitimate when the reasons were emotional (drunk, rage). The justification of some types of aggressive behaviour were dependent on the conditions under which they occurred, whereas others appeared independent. Killing and torture were the most disapproved kinds of aggressive behaviour. Another's attack was the most powerful instigator of feelings of aggression, whereas frustration seemed relatively unimportant. Females approved of emotional expressions of aggression to a greater extent than did males. The moral test did not correlate with approval of aggression in general, but a couple of more specific predictions about the effects of level of moral reasoning on attitudes to socially sanctioned forms of aggression were tentatively confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments concerning the possible role of components of the pituitary–adrenocortical axis (ACTH and glucocorticoids) in isolation-induced intermale fighting behavior in laboratory strains of mice are reviewed. A series of experiments which investigate factors that may influence the successful demonstration of this relationship are described. Differences in performances in standard-opponent tests of some outbred strains of albino mice are indicated, as well as an interesting positive correlation between the aggressiveness and the relative adrenal weights of the strains employed. Long-acting preparations of both ACTH and ACTH 4–10, injected throughout a period of isolation, suppressed fighting behavior in intact TO-strain mice in subsequent standard-opponent and trained-fighter tests. After it had been confirmed that vigorous isolation-induced fighting could be obtained in bilaterally castrated mice which had been subcutaneously implanted with testosterone pellets, the effects of long-acting preparations of ACTH, ACTH 4–10, ACTH 1–10, and ACTH 4–10 D-phe on the fighting behavior of such animals were studied. A significant suppression of fighting behavior was evident only with respect to ACTH, suggesting that ACTH 4–10 may have its action on this behavior in a manner rather different from that of the parent molecule. Some evidence was also obtained indicating that the zinc used in the preparation of long-acting injections of ACTH and its analogs may also cause a decline in the level of fighting behavior, in a standard-opponent test, in TO-strain mice which had been castrated and testosterone implanted. While such a finding does not affect the validity of the recorded behavioral influences of ACTH and ACTH 4–10 described earlier, it does seem likely that the presence of this substance in placebo injections would make the demonstration of the actions of the pep tides difficult, as there would be a low level of fighting in all categories. Rather less impressive results were obtained with respect to the influences of ACTH preparations and zinc on castrated—implanted CFW mice. The studies identify a number of the factors which may influence the successful demonstration of a relationship between the functioning of the pituitary—adrenocortical axis and isolation-induced agonistic behavior in the mouse. A number of general, if tentative, conclusions may also be listed. It seems likely, in spite of the interpretational difficulties caused by what seems to be a complex and rather unstable relationship, that ACTH and glucocorticoids may have profound influences on this type of fighting behavior in this species. One may also conclude that the evidence for an extraadrenal influence of ACTH on this behavior appears stronger as a result of these and related studies and that the actions of ACTH and its analogs on murine fighting behavior may be logically related to the actions of these compounds on the acquisition and extinction of conditioned avoidance reactions in hypophysectomized rats. The possible utility of such actions to the natural territorial habit of the adult male mouse is also indicated.",

Of these genes, the ones that code for the enzymes that influence the turnover of dopamine (DA) have received the most attention. In this study, we investigated 12 genetic polymorphisms in four genes involved with DA functioning (COMT, MAOA and MAOB, and DbetaH) in 179 incarcerated male Russian adolescents and two groups of matched controls: boys without criminal records referred to by their teachers as (a) \"troubled-behavior-free\" boys, n=182; and (b) \"troubled-behavior\" boys, n=60. The participants were classified as (1) being incarcerated or not, (2) having the DSM-IV diagnosis of conduct disorder (CD) or not, and (3) having committed violent or nonviolent crimes (for the incarcerated individuals only). The findings indicate that, although no single genetic variant in any of the four genes differentiated individuals in the investigated groups, various linear combinations (i.e., haplotypes) and nonlinear combinations (i.e., interactions between variants within and across genes) of genetic variants resulted in informative and robust classifications for two of the three groupings. These combinations of genetic variants differentiated individuals in incarceration vs. nonincarcerated and CD vs. no-CD groups; no informative combinations were established consistently for the grouping by crime within the incarcerated individuals. This study underscores the importance of considering multiple rather than single markers within candidate genes and their additive and interactive combinations, both with themselves and with nongenetic indicators, while attempting to understand the genetic background of such complex behaviors as serious conduct problems.",

Study 1 involved direct and indirect aggression among young Indian men, and Study 2 physical aggression to dating partners among Spanish adolescents. In Study 1, perceived benefits and costs but not self-control were associated with direct aggression at other men, and the association remained when their close association with indirect aggression was controlled. In Study 2, benefits and self-control showed significant and independent associations (positive for benefits, negative for self-control) with physical aggression at other-sex partners. Although being victimized was also correlated in the same direction with self-control and benefits, perpetration and being victimized were highly correlated, and there was no association between being victimized and these variables when perpetration was controlled. These results support the theory that reflective (cost-benefit analyses) processes and impulsive (self-control) processes operate in parallel in affecting aggression. The finding that male adolescents perceived more costs and fewer benefits from physical aggression to a partner than female adolescents did is consistent with findings indicating greater social disapproval of men hitting women than vice versa, rather than with the view that male violence to women is facilitated by internalized patriarchal values.",

A model was proposed whereby dysregulated reactivity was directly and indirectly related to concurrent peer victimization through victimization‐related emotional distress. The model further proposed that dysregulated reactivity directly incrementally predicted longitudinal peer victimization above and beyond the effect of concurrent victimization. Two hundred thirteen 9‐ to 13‐year‐old children and their parents completed measures of dysregulated reactivity and victimization experiences at baseline and 6‐month follow‐up. Children also related narratives of personal victimization experiences at baseline that were coded to assess victimization‐related emotional distress. Model testing strongly supported the direct association of dysregulated reactivity with concurrent victimization and incremental predictive effects of dysregulated reactivity on peer victimization over time. Model testing also provided support for an indirect effect of dysregulated reactivity on concurrent peer victimization through victimization‐related emotional distress.

The current cross‐sectional study examined the association between the five‐factor model of impulsivity‐like traits (negative urgency, positive urgency, premeditation, perseverance, and sensation seeking), emotional lability, and physically aggressive behaviors among college students ( n = 481) in a negative binomial hurdle model. In the logistic portion of the model, emotional lability was related to a higher likelihood of engaging in aggressive acts in the past 6 months. The association between emotional lability and the likelihood of aggressive behavior was moderated by two impulsivity‐like traits: negative urgency and positive urgency. Specifically, emotional lability was related to engaging in aggressive acts among those with high negative urgency, and among those with low positive urgency. In the count portion of the model, emotional lability was uniquely related to the number of aggressive acts in the past 6 months. Our results indicate that emotional lability and facets of impulsivity interactively relate to engagement in aggressive behavior, suggesting that these variables be integrated into models of aggression.

Aggressive and income offending at Waves 1 through 10 were regressed onto a dichotomous measure of prior involvement in animal cruelty and four control variables (age, race, sex, early onset behavior problems) assessed at Wave 0 (baseline). Results indicated that childhood animal cruelty was equally predictive of aggressive and non‐aggressive (income) offending, a finding inconsistent with the hypothesis that cruelty toward animals desensitizes a person to future interpersonal aggression or in some way prepares the individual for interpersonal violence toward humans. Whereas a significant sex by animal cruelty interaction was predicted, there was no evidence that sex or any of the other demographic variables included in this study (age, race) consistently moderated the animal cruelty–subsequent offending relationship. On the other hand, two cognitive‐personality measures (interpersonal hostility, callousness/unemotionality) were found to successfully mediate the animal cruelty–subsequent offending relationship. Outcomes from this study imply that a causal nexus—partially or fully mediated by hostility, callousness/unemotionality, and other cognitive‐personality variables—may exist between childhood animal cruelty and subsequent offending, although the effect is not specific to violence.

    "abstract": "Men's greater use of direct aggression is not evident in studies of intimate partner aggression. In previous research, the effects of target sex and relationship intimacy have frequently been confounded. This study sought to examine these effects separately. One hundred and seventy-four participants (59 male and 115 female) read vignette scenarios in which they were provoked by a same-sex best friend, an opposite-sex best friend, and a partner. For each target, participants estimated their likely use of direct physical and verbal aggression as well as noninjurious forms of anger expression. Results showed that men lower their aggression in the context of an intimate partnership and that this is an effect of the target's sex. In contrast, women raise their aggression in the context of an intimate partnership and this is an effect of intimacy with the target. The use of noninjurious angry behavior did not vary between targets for either sex of the participant, which suggests that the effects of target are confined to behaviors which carry an intention to harm. Possible effects of social norms and oxytocin-mediated emotional disinhibition on intimate partner aggression are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 37:268–277, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Fifty-five male offenders attending a community forensic mental health service for pre-sentence psychiatric and/or psychological evaluation were assessed for aggressive script rehearsal, aggression-supportive normative beliefs, FFM personality traits, trait anger and past aggressive behavior. With regard to relationships between five factor variables and aggression, results suggested that only agreeableness and conscientiousness were related to aggression. However, these relationships were: (1) weak in comparison with those between script rehearsal, normative beliefs and trait anger with aggression and (2) were not significant predictors in hierarchical regression analysis when all of the significant univariate predictors, including GAM-specified variables were regressed onto life history of aggression; normative beliefs supporting aggression, aggressive script rehearsal, and trait anger were significantly related to aggression in this regression analysis. These results provide further support for the application of the GAM to aggressive populations.",

In the game, three options were available: participants could earn points; attack their opponent by deducting points; and defend themselves against point deduction by their opponent. There was no main effect of OT on these responses, however there was an interaction with state anxiety. In the placebo condition, women higher in state anxiety showed a significantly higher ratio of Attack-to-Earn responses than low anxiety women. Under oxytocin, there was a significant reduction in their Attack:Earn ratio resulting in no significant difference between high and low state anxiety groups. There was a similar trend for the Defend:Earn ratio. The reduction of reactive aggression in state anxious women supports the view that OT may decrease negative behavior and increase constructive behavior even under conditions of provocation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Winning an aggressive encounter enhances the probability of winning future contests. This phenomenon, known as the winner effect, has been well studied across vertebrate species. While numerous animal models have been developed to study the winner effect in the laboratory setting, large variation in experimental design, choice of species, and housing conditions have resulted in conflicting reports on the behavioral outcomes. The Syrian hamster ( Mesocricetus auratus ) presents as a novel species with face validity to study the effects of repeated fighting on subsequent agonistic encounters. After a 14‐day training period, “trained fighter” hamsters displayed elevated fighting behaviors characterized by more intense and severe displays of aggression along with increased displays of dominant postures compared to naïve residents with no prior social experience. To determine whether these phenotypic changes in fighting behavior reflect alterations in neurochemistry, brains of aggressive and naïve hamsters were examined for changes in dopaminergic innervation in key regions known to control social and motivational behavior. Interestingly, changes in tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine production, were observed in brain regions within the social decision‐making network. These increases in aggression observed after repeated winning may reflect a learned behavior resulting from increases in neurotransmitter activity which serve to reinforce the behavior. The data implicate the presence of a winner effect in hamsters and provide evidence for a neural mechanism underlying the changes in aggressive behavior after repeated agonistic encounters. Aggr.

Associations have been reported between the serotonin transporter (5‐HTT) and aggression, and between socioeconomic status (SES), aggression, and serotonergic functions of the brain. We aimed to investigate associations between the 5‐HTTLPR genotype and family SES in relation to delinquent behavior among adolescents. A total of 1,467 17‐ to 18‐year‐old students in the county of Västmanland, Sweden, anonymously completed a questionnaire and gave a saliva sample. Family SES had a U‐shaped relation to delinquency, where adolescents with low and high family SES were the most delinquent. There were curvilinear interactions between the 5‐HTTLPR genotype and family SES in relation to delinquency. Among individuals having high family SES, boys with the LL (homozygous for the long allele) or LS (heterozygous) genotypes and girls with the SS (homozygous for the short allele) or LS (heterozygous) genotypes showed the highest delinquency scores. Among individuals having low family SES, boys with the LL (homozygous for the long allele) genotype and girls with the LS (heterozygous) genotype showed the highest delinquency scores.

The population-average (generalized estimating equation, GEE) odds of carrying a weapon to school in the last month were estimated as a function of past-year exposure to violent content in video, computer, and Internet games, as well as peer aggression and biological sex. The sample included youth who were at risk for both the exposure (i.e., game play) and the outcome (i.e., who attended public or private school). 3,397 observations from 1,489 youth were included in analyses. 1.4% of youth reported carrying a weapon to school in the last month and 69% reported that at least some of the games they played depicted violence. After adjusting for other potentially influential characteristics (e.g., aggressive behavior), playing at least some violent games in the past year was associated with a fourfold increase in odds of also reporting carrying a weapon to school in the last month. Although youth who reported frequent and intense peer victimization in the past year were more likely to report carrying a weapon to school in the last month, this relation was explained by other influential characteristics. Consistent with the predictions of social-cognitive, observational learning theory, this study supports the hypothesis that carrying weapons to school is associated with violent game play. As one of the first studies of its kind, findings should be interpreted cautiously and need to be replicated.",

Despite the diagnostic emphasis on the failure to control aggressive impulses, there is little research on affective processes and emotion regulation in IED; however, this research suggests possible dysfunctions in experiences of emotional intensity and lability. The hypothesis in the present study was that compared to individuals with other psychiatric disorders, and psychologically healthy individuals, individuals with IED experience greater negative affect intensity and emotional lability. Participants (N = 373) consisted of 202 individuals diagnosed with IED, 68 non-IED psychiatric controls (PC), and 103 healthy volunteers (HV). Emotion regulation was assessed using the General Behavior Inventory, the Affective Lability Scale, and the Affect Intensity Measure. Results showed that IED participants reported greater negative affect intensity and greater emotional lability across several emotion domains (e.g., anger, anxiety, depression) than PC and HV participants. These findings suggest that IED is characterized by more global emotion regulation deficits than those associated with anger alone. Aggr. Behav. 41:25-33 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Results from three (3) independent studies strongly confirm that \"professors\" who were generous with their grades were rewarded for their favor with higher SETs, while professors who were frugal were punished with lower SETs (Study 1, d = 1.51; Study 2, d = 1.59; Study 3, partial η 2 = .26). This result was found even when the feedback was manipulated to be more or less insulting (Study 3). Consistent with laboratory findings on direct aggression, results also indicated that, when participants were given a poorer feedback, higher self‐esteem (Study 1 and Study 2) and higher narcissism (Study 1) were associated with them giving lower (more aggressive) evaluations of the \"professor.\" Moreover, consistent with findings on self‐serving biases, participants higher in self‐esteem who were in the positive grade/feedback condition exhibited a self‐enhancing bias by giving their \"professor\" higher evaluations (Study 1 and Study 2). The aforementioned relationships were not moderated by the professor's sex or rank (teaching assistant vs.professor). Results provide evidence that (1) students do aggress against professors through poor teaching evaluations, (2) threatened egotism among individuals with high self‐esteem is associated with more aggression, especially when coupled with high narcissism, and (3) self‐enhancing biases are robust among those with high self‐esteem.

The present research looks at this issue by examining the associations between the trajectories of delinquent behavior in adolescence and adult functioning. Data for the present study are from a four-wave longitudinal study of African American and Hispanic participants. Participants provided information at mean ages 14, 19, 24, and 29. We used growth mixture modeling to extract trajectory groups of delinquent behavior in adolescence and young adulthood. Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether memberships in the trajectory groups of delinquent behavior from mean age 14 to mean age 24 were associated with violence, substance abuse and dependence, partner discord, peer substance use, and residence in a high-crime neighborhood at mean age 29 when compared with the reference trajectory group of participants with low or no delinquent behavior. Four trajectory groups of delinquent behavior were identified: the no/low, the decreasing, the moderate, and the high persistent trajectory groups. Memberships in the trajectory groups were significantly correlated with variations in adult functioning. Memberships in some trajectory groups of delinquent behavior are significant predictors of later violent behavior, substance abuse and dependence, partner discord, peer substance use, and residence in a high-crime neighborhood. The findings reinforce the importance of investing in interventions to address different patterns of delinquent behavior. Findings are discussed in relation to previous investigations with non-Hispanic White samples.",

    "abstract": "Aggression may be performed for different reasons, such as defending oneself (reactive aggression) or to reach egoistic aims (proactive aggression). It is a widely accepted notion that a lack of theory of mind (ToM) as a basic social competence should be linked to higher aggression, but findings on the developmental links between ToM and different functions of aggression have been inconsistent. One reason for this may be the failure of taking the bi‐dimensionality of both ToM (cognitive vs. affective) and aggression (reactive vs. proactive) into account. In addition, the direction of effect remains unclear because longitudinal studies examining the mutual influences of both constructs are rare. Because research on ToM has focused on the preschool years, little is known about its development in middle childhood. Therefore, the present study examined the bi‐directional developmental links of cognitive and affective ToM with reactive and proactive aggression in a longitudinal study in N = 232, 6‐ to 9‐year‐olds. Two points of measurement with a delay of about 1 year were conducted, and data were analyzed via cross‐lagged structural equation modeling (SEM), controlling for age, gender, and information processing. In general, early ToM predicted later functions of aggression, but not vice versa. Cognitive and affective ToM were inversely related to later reactive aggression, but only affective but not cognitive ToM was inversely related to later proactive aggression. These findings emphasize the importance of ToM for the occurrence of aggression and of taking the bi‐dimensionality of both constructs into account when investigating their developmental links across childhood.",

However, this period is crucial for children's development as at this age they start to participate in a stable peer group, and difficulties in social interactions can be detected early by professionals. An interactive animated web‐based computer program was used in this study to assess peer relationships among young children. The computerized assessment was conducted among 2,135 children in grades 1–2 from 22 elementary schools to examine the association of bullying, victimization, and defending with being accepted or rejected. Same‐sex and other‐sex peer relations were distinguished using dyadic data. Both boys and girls were more likely to accept same‐sex classmates than other‐sex classmates, and boys were more often nominated than girls as perpetrators of bullying against both boys and girls. It was found that bullies were rejected by those for whom they posed a potential threat, and that defenders were preferred by those classmates for whom they were a potential source of protection. Bullies chose victims who were rejected by significant others, but contrary to expectations, children who bullied boys scored low on peer affection. It is possible that these bullies were not strategic enough to select the “right” targets. Overall, the current findings provide evidence for strategies involved in bullying and defending at early age. Aggr. Behav. 39:462–471, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The goal of this event-related brain potentials (ERPs) study was to track the neural activity associated with the violation of expectations about hostile versus nonhostile intentions in aggressive and nonaggressive individuals and examine how this neural activity relates to self-reported hostile attributional bias and impulsive aggression in real life. To this end, scenarios with a hostile versus nonhostile social context followed by a character's ambiguous aversive behavior were presented to readers, and ERPs to critical words that specified the hostile versus nonhostile intent behind the behavior were analysed. Thirty-seven aggressive and fifty nonaggressive individuals participated in the study. The presentation of a critical word that violated hostile expectation caused an N400 response that was significantly larger in aggressive than nonaggressive individuals. Results also showed an enhanced late positive potential-like component in aggressive individuals when hostile intention scenarios took place in a nonhostile context, which is associated with impulsive aggression in real life even after having controlled for the effect of self-reported hostile attributional bias. The Hostile Expectancy Violation paradigm evaluated in this study represents a promising tool to investigate the relationship between the online processing of hostile intent in others and impulsive aggression.

In contrast, after playing a nonviolent video game, the relationship between everyday sadism and participant's negative mood was less pronounced. Overall, these studies show that everyday sadists specifically like to play violent video games and suggest that this tendency is adaptive in that they emotionally benefit from playing violent video games.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous work has shown that playing violent video games can stimulate aggression toward others. The current research has identified a potential exception. Participants who played a violent game in which the violence had an explicitly prosocial motive (i.e., protecting a friend and furthering his nonviolent goals) were found to show lower short‐term aggression (Study 1) and show higher levels of prosocial cognition (Study 2) than individuals who played a violent game in which the violence was motivated by more morally ambiguous motives. Thus, violent video games that are framed in an explicitly prosocial context may evoke more prosocial sentiments and thereby mitigate some of the short‐term effects on aggression observed in previous research. While these findings are promising regarding the potential aggression‐reducing effects of prosocial context, caution is still warranted as a small effect size difference ( d = .2–.3), although nonsignificant, was still observed between those who played the explicitly prosocial violent game and those who played a nonviolent game; indicating that aggressive behavior was not completely eliminated by the inclusion of a prosocial context for the violence.

We explored two explanations for the religion-aggression link. First, most major religions teach self-control (e.g., delaying gratification, resisting temptation), which diminishes aggression. Second, most major religions emphasize compassionate beliefs and behavior (i.e., perspective taking, forgiveness, a broader love of humanity) that are incompatible with aggression. We tested whether self-control and compassion mediated the relationship between religion and aggression (direct and indirect) in a longitudinal study of 1,040 adolescents in the United States. Structural equation analyses revealed that self-control and compassion together completely mediated the religion-aggression relationship for both types of aggression.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, criminological research has identified a number of risk factors that contribute to the development of aggressive and delinquent behavior. Although studies have identified media violence in general and violent video gaming in particular as significant predictors of aggressive behavior, exposure to violent video games has been largely omitted from the risk factor literature on delinquent behavior. This cross‐sectional study therefore investigates the relationship between violent video game play and adolescents' delinquent behavior using a risk factor approach. An online survey was completed by 3,372 Flemish adolescents, aged 12–18 years old. Data were analyzed by means of negative binomial regression modelling. Results indicated a significant contribution of violent video games in delinquent behavior over and beyond multiple known risk variables (peer delinquency, sensation seeking, prior victimization, and alienation). Moreover, the final model that incorporated the gaming genres proved to be significantly better than the model without the gaming genres. Results provided support for a cumulative and multiplicative risk model for delinquent behavior. Aggr. Behav. 41:267–279, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

A comprehensive measure of offending behavior was administered to 184 men and 171 women, together with measures of anger, self-control, and psychopathic traits. The measure, the nonviolent and violent offending behavior scale (NVOBS), assesses IPV, general violence, and nonviolent offending behavior. Men perpetrated higher levels of general violence and nonviolent offenses than women, whereas women perpetrated significantly more IPV than men. Regression analyses showed that the predictors of offending behavior are generally similar for men and women, with the exception of IPV, where self-control was a better predictor of IPV for men and anger was a better predictor of IPV for women.

    "abstract": "The Reactive Proactive Questionnaire (RPQ) was originally developed to assess reactive and proactive aggressive behavior in children. Nevertheless, some studies have used the RPQ in adults. This study examines the reliability of the RPQ within an adult sample by investigating whether reactive and proactive aggression can be distinguished at a variable- and person-based level. Male adults from forensic samples (N = 237) and from the general population (N = 278) completed the RPQ questionnaire. Variable-based approaches, including factor analyses, were conducted to verify the two-factor model of the RPQ and to examine alternative factor solutions of the 23 items. Subsequently, a person-based approach, i.e., Latent Class Analysis (LCA), was executed to identify homogeneous classes of subjects with similar profiles of aggression in the observed data. The RPQ proved to have sufficient internal consistency. Multiple-factor models were examined, but the original two-factor model was statistically and theoretically considered as most solid and in line with previous research. The multi-level LCA identified three different classes of aggression severity (class 1 showed low aggressive behavior; class 2 subjects displayed modest aggression levels; and class 3 exhibited the highest level of aggressive behavior). In addition, class 1 and 2 showed more reactive than proactive aggression, whereas class 3 displayed comparable levels of reactive/proactive aggression. The RPQ appears to have clinical relevance for adult populations in the way that it can distinguish severity levels of aggression. Before the RPQ is implemented in adult populations, norm scores need to be developed. Aggr. Behav. 43:155-162, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The present study examined the longitudinal relations among adolescents' self-reported effortful control (EC), exposure to community violence, both as a witness and as a victim, and aggressive behavior. Participants were 768 Italian adolescents (358 males) living in a high-risk context, with a mean age at T1 of 11 years in the younger cohort and 14 years in the older cohort. In a four-wave cross-lagged panel design, low EC was a strong predictor of aggressive behavior across each time point, whereas aggressive behavior was found to positively predict adolescents' violence exposure both as witnesses and victims. Some evidence of transactional relations was also found between adjustment problems and exposure to community violence and between EC and externalizing problems. Moreover, EC was indirectly related to exposure to violence through externalizing problems, and mediated the relation of witnessing community violence to aggression, thus supporting the view that top-down regulatory processes play a complex role in the development of violence and other externalizing problems. The importance of considering interventions that take in account these complex relations is discussed.",

Associations between corporal punishment and a number of lifetime aggression indicators were examined in this study after efforts to control the potential influence of various forms of co-occurring maltreatment (parental physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse, sibling abuse, peer bullying, and observed parental violence). College students (N = 1,136) provided retrospective self-reports regarding their history of aggression and levels of exposure to childhood corporal punishment and maltreatment experiences. Analyses focused on three hypotheses: 1) The odds of experiencing childhood physical abuse would be higher among respondents reporting frequent corporal punishment during upbringing; 2) Corporal punishment scores would predict the criterion aggression indices after control of variance associated with childhood maltreatment; 3) Aggression scores would be higher among respondents classified in the moderate and elevated corporal punishment risk groups. Strong support was found for the first hypothesis since the odds of childhood physical abuse recollections were higher (OR = 65.3) among respondents who experienced frequent (>60 total disciplinary acts) corporal punishment during upbringing. Partial support was found for the second and third hypotheses. Dimensional and categorical corporal punishment scores were associated significantly with half of the criterion measures. These findings support efforts to dissuade reliance on corporal punishment to manage child behavior.",

However, research has not empirically tested the bidirectional associations of state rumination and anger, as experience sampling methodology can do. We predicted that state anger and rumination would be bi-directionally associated, both concurrently and over time, even controlling for trait anger and rumination. In addition, because mindfulness is associated with rumination and anger at the bivariate level, we examined the effect of trait mindfulness on the bidirectional association between state rumination and anger. We examined two hypotheses: (i) state rumination mediates the effect of trait mindfulness on state anger; and (ii) trait mindfulness weakens, or moderates, the bidirectional associations between state rumination and anger. In an experience-sampling study, 200 college students reported their current ruminative thinking and angry mood several times a day for 7 days. Mixed model analyses indicated that state anger and rumination predicted each other concurrently. In cross-lagged analyses, previous anger did not uniquely predict current rumination; previous rumination predicted current anger, although the effect was small. In support of our hypothesis, state rumination mediated the association between trait mindfulness and state anger. Additionally, trait mindfulness moderated the concurrent and cross-lagged associations between state rumination and anger, although the results were complex. This study contributes new information about the complex interplay of rumination and anger. Findings also add support to the theory that mindfulness decreases emotional reactivity. Aggr.

In the present research, we focused on a potential determinant of adolescents' willingness to play violent video games: social exclusion. We also tested whether exclusion can predict increased aggressiveness following violent video game playing. In two experiments, we predicted that exclusion could increase adolescents' preferences for violent video games and interact with violent game playing fostering adolescents' aggressive inclinations. In Study 1, 121 adolescents (aged 10-18 years) were randomly assigned to a manipulation of social exclusion. Then, they evaluated the violent content of nine different video games (violent, nonviolent, or prosocial) and reported their willingness to play each presented video game. The results showed that excluded participants expressed a greater willingness to play violent games than nonviolent or prosocial games. No such effect was found for included participants. In Study 2, both inclusionary status and video game contents were manipulated. After a manipulation of inclusionary status, 113 adolescents (aged 11-16 years) were randomly assigned to play either a violent or a nonviolent video game. Then, they were given an opportunity to express their aggressive inclinations toward the excluders. Results showed that excluded participants who played a violent game displayed the highest level of aggressive inclinations than participants who were assigned to the other experimental conditions. Overall, these findings suggest that exclusion increases preferences for violent games and that the combination of exclusion and violent game playing fuels aggressive inclinations.",

We examined whether playing two or more hours of violent video games a day, compared to not playing video games, was associated with a different pattern of recognition of five facial emotions, while controlling for general perceptual and cognitive differences that might also occur. Undergraduate students were categorized as violent video game players ( n = 83) or non‐gamers ( n = 69) and completed a facial recognition task, consisting of an emotion recognition condition and a control condition of gender recognition. Additionally, participants completed questionnaires assessing their video game and media consumption, aggression, and mood. Violent video game players recognized fearful faces both more accurately and quickly and disgusted faces less accurately than non‐gamers. Desensitization to violence, constant exposure to fear and anxiety during game playing, and the habituation to unpleasant stimuli, are possible mechanisms that could explain these results.

    "abstract": "Researchers have become increasingly interested in the saturation of popular Western culture by female hypersexualization. We provide data showing that men have more sexually aggressive intentions toward women who self-sexualize, and that self-sexualized women are vulnerable to sexual aggression if two qualifying conditions are met. Specifically, if perceivers view self-sexualized women as sexually open and lacking agency (i.e., the ability to influence one's environment), they harbor more sexually aggressive intentions and view women as easier to sexually victimize. In Experiment 1, male participants viewed a photograph of a woman whose self-sexualization was manipulated through revealing versus non-revealing clothing. In subsequent experiments, men and women (Experiment 2) and men only (Experiment 3) viewed a photograph of a woman dressed in non-revealing clothing but depicted as open or closed to sexual activity. Participants rated their perceptions of the woman's agency, then judged how vulnerable she was to sexual aggression (Experiments 1 and 2) or completed a sexually aggressive intentions measure (Experiment 3). Results indicated that both men and women perceived self-sexualized women as more vulnerable to sexual aggression because they assumed those women were highly sexually open and lacked agency. Perceptions of low agency also mediated the relationship between women's perceived sexual openness and men's intentions to sexually aggress. These effects persisted even when we described the self-sexualized woman as possessing highly agentic personality traits and controlled for individual differences related to sexual offending. The current work suggests that perceived agency and sexual openness may inform perpetrator decision-making and that cultural hypersexualization may facilitate sexual aggression. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated that both leaders and other individuals vary in dispositional levels of physical aggression, which are genetically influenced. Yet the importance of individual differences in aggression for attitudes toward foreign policy or context‐laden moral choices, such as sacrificing the lives of some for the greater good of many, has yet to be fully explored. Given the global importance of such decisions, we undertook this exploration in a sample of 586 Australians, including 250 complete twin pairs. We found that individuals who scored higher on Buss–Perry's physical aggression scale were more likely to support aggressive foreign policy interventions and displayed a more utilitarian moral calculus than those who scored lower on this scale. Furthermore, we found that the majority of variance in physical aggression lay in genetic factors for men, whereas the majority of the variance was in environmental factors for women. The source of covariation between aggression and political choices also differed between the sexes. A combination of genetic and environmental factors accounted for most of the cross‐trait correlations among males, whereas common and unique environmental factors accounted for most of the cross‐trait correlations among females. We consider the implications of our results for understanding how trait measures of aggression are associated with foreign policy and moral choices, providing evidence for why and how individuals differ in responding to complex social dilemmas.

    "abstract": "Research on cyberbullying has boomed in the past two decades. Findings from studies among adolescents suggest that they can be classified into distinct groups based on their cyberbullying experience, and that cyberbullying seems to be related to poor emotion regulation. So far, only a few studies have examined cyberbullying among adult workers and it is unclear whether cyberbullying develops similarly in that population. Therefore, in this study cyberbullying victimization was assessed in adolescents and adult workers simultaneously to address three aims: (1) to explore which groups can be distinguished based on their cyberbullying experience; (2) to analyze the associations of group membership with the way people regulate their emotions; and (3) to examine whether the results are comparable in adolescents and adults. Latent class analysis was used to analyze data from 1,426 employees and 1,715 adolescents in the first year of secondary education (12–13 years old). In each population, three profiles differing in their patterns of cybervictimization were identified: no cybervictimization (80%), work‐related cybervictimization (18%), and pervasive cybervictimization (3%) for adults, and no cybervictimization (68%), similar‐to‐offline cybervictimization (27%), and pervasive cybervictimization (4%) for adolescents. Furthermore, these profiles differed in their use of emotion regulation strategies, with pervasive cyber‐victims suppressing their emotions significantly more than other groups. Future research is needed to clarify the role of emotion regulation in cyberbullying as an antecedent or consequence of victimization.",

However, based on the differential susceptibility hypothesis, this risk is expected to vary based on the individual's unique risk and protective factors. Using survey data from 1,990 adolescents (Mean age = 15.6 ± 1.10 years; 48% female) and content analysis of U.S. top‐grossing films and popular TV shows, we evaluated the effect of MVE in relation to both risk (i.e., family conflict, impulsivity, sensation seeking) and protective factors (i.e., parental monitoring, parental involvement, parental mediation). Relative weights analyses revealed that MVE was one of the strongest predictors of aggression, after impulsivity and family conflict. The cumulative risk score showed a linear and quadratic relation with the likelihood of aggression, with MVE and family conflict having an interactive relation in predicting aggression. Parental monitoring remained a significant protective factor even when all risk factors were accounted for. Targeted preventive interventions that reduce family conflict, promote parental monitoring, and reduce exposure to violent media may be effective in reducing aggressive tendencies and related negative outcomes.",

Research on meta-cognition has recently identified that the predictive utility of individual-difference inventories can be improved by considering the certainty with which people hold their self-views. Merging these two frameworks, the present research examines whether assessing certainty in trait aggressiveness improves its ability to predict aggressive outcomes. Across two studies, participants reported their level of trait physical aggressiveness and the certainty with which they held their responses to the scale (predictor variables). Aggressive behavioral intentions (Study 1 and 2) and actual aggressive behavior (Study 2) were used as dependent measures. As hypothesized, results indicated that certainty moderated the effects of individual-differences in aggressiveness on both aggressive outcomes. Therefore, considering the certainty with which people hold their relevant traits can be useful for understanding aggression, and also for predicting the consistency between personality and behavior.",

This pattern of findings was consistent across different measures, which considered both aggressive tendencies against the rejecting partners and hostile attitudes against the opposite gender.

    "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that when identifying individuals involved in bullying, the concordance between self- and peer- reports is low to moderate. There is support that self- and peer- identified victims constitute distinct types of victims and differ in adjustment. Likewise, differentiating between self- and peer- reports of bullying may also reveal distinct types of bullies. The goal of this study was to examine differences between types of bullies identified via dyadic nominations (self-identified, victim-identified, and self/victim identified). First, we examined the concordance between dyadic nominations of bullying and traditional measures of bullying (i.e., self- and peer-reports). Second, we compared the behavioral profiles of the bully types to nonbullies, with a focus on aggressive behaviors and social status. Third, we examined whether the types of bullies targeted victims with different levels of popularity, as well as the role of their own popularity and prioritizing of popularity. Participants were 1,008 Dutch adolescents (50.1% male, Mage = 14.14 years, standard deviation [SD] = 1.30) who completed a classroom assessment of dyadic nominations, peer nominations, and self-report items. Results indicated that victim identified and self/victim identified bullies were more aggressive, more popular, and less socially preferred than self-identified bullies and nonbullies. Self/victim identified bullies targeted victims with the highest social status. The association between bully type and victims' popularity was further qualified by bullies' own popularity and the degree to which they prioritized popularity. Implications for the implementation of dyadic nominations are discussed.",

Study 2 ( N = 412) tested the mediating role of perceived moral intensity through self‐rated questionnaires. Study 3 ( N = 295) examined the behavioral consequences of reduced moral sensitivity on online shaming by manipulating social media and perceived moral intensity. Across these three studies with their different methodologies, we found consistent support for our prediction that social media reduce users' moral sensitivity. Also, our findings shed light on perceived moral intensity as a mediator. As expected, less perceived moral intensity and less moral sensitivity (as serial mediators) induced by social media led to a higher tendency to participate in online shaming. In addition, our research suggests that the harmful effects of social media could be restricted by improving users' perceived moral intensity in the form of reminders. These findings provide novel insights into the underlying mechanism of cyberviolence on social media and also contribute to the literature on the antecedents and consequences of moral sensitivity.",

A recent review suggests that over 150 different quantification strategies have been used in this literature, and there is evidence to suggest that different operationalizations can affect the results and interpretations of experiments using CRTTs. In the current investigation, we reanalyze data from four existing samples from two different sites (total N = 600) to examine how the relations between a range of personality traits and aggression vary based on how aggression is operationalized. Our results suggest that there is a modest degree of heterogeneity in effect size and direction for these relations, and that effect size and direction were most consistent for traits more generally related to lab aggression (e.g., psychopathy, low Five‐Factor Model agreeableness). In addition, profile matching analyses suggest that different operationalizations yield empirical correlates that are quite similar to one another, even when quantifying absolute rather than relative similarity. These results were consistent across site, methodology, and type of sample, suggesting that these issues are likely generalizable across most labs using CRTTs. We conclude with suggestions for future directions, particularly emphasizing the need for adequately‐powered samples, and for researchers to preregister a plan for how CRTT data will be analyzed.",

In this report, we consider the inappropriate use of force by police from the perspective of behavioral and social science inquiry related to aggression, violence, and intergroup relations. We examine the inappropriate use of force by police in the context of research on modern policing as well as critical race theory and offer five recommendations suggested by contemporary theory and research. Our recommendations are aimed at policymakers, law enforcement administrators, and scholars and are as follows: (1) Implement public policies that can reduce inappropriate use of force directly and through the reduction of broader burdens on the routine activities of police officers. (2) For officers frequently engaged in use‐of‐force incidents, ensure that best practice, evidence‐based treatments are available and required. (3) Improve and increase the quality and delivery of noncoercive conflict resolution training for all officers, along with police administrative policies and supervision that support alternatives to the use of force, both while scaling back the militarization of police departments. (4) Continue the development and evaluation of multicomponent interventions for police departments, but ensure they incorporate evidence‐based, field‐tested components. (5) Expand research in the behavioral and social sciences aimed at understanding and managing use‐of‐force by police and reducing its disproportionate impact on minoritized communities, and expand funding for these lines of inquiry.",

All tetrad traits except narcissism were positively associated with schizotypy, but only at moderate levels. Study 2 administered the same personality battery to 303 members of an online community sample: Aggression outcomes were measured with both self‐reports and a behavioral measure—the Voodoo Doll Task. Regression analyses determined the unique contributions of the five personality variables. Two dark traits—psychopathy and sadism—were strong predictors of self‐report aggression.

Additionally, the data from the only previous nationally representative study were gathered more than 30 years ago. Results of the present study generally supported the CM. Extreme pornography exposure and impersonal sexuality were both associated with a higher probability of sexual aggression. Although impersonal sex was a robust predictor in and of itself, men who were more exposed to pornography and impersonal in their approach to sex were more likely to be sexually aggressive than men who were impersonal in their approach to sex but less exposed to pornography. Results maintained when indicators of sex drive were included in analyses. The only finding inconsistent with the CM was that the association between pornography exposure and sexual aggression was stronger among men lower rather than higher in impersonal sex.",

Other research has shown that video game play can have a positive impact on the player's mood. Based on the General Aggression Model and mood management theory, we thus hypothesized that habitual violent video game players misinterpret their better mood after game play as a reduction of aggressive feelings and hence believe in the cathartic effects of violent video games. Two studies examined this reasoning in the player's natural habitat. Habitual video game players were surveyed multiple times for a period of 2 weeks before and after each gaming session. Results showed that playing video games improved the participant's mood, which in turn was positively associated with the belief in the cathartic effect of violent video game play. Importantly, this relation held when controlling for the player's actual level of aggressive feelings. Study 1 further showed that playing a violent game tended to lead to a higher level of reported aggressive feelings after playing. In contrast, in Study 2, level of reported aggressive feelings was not related to the violence of the game. Taken together, habitual violent video game players (erroneously) believe in the cathartic effects of violent video games, because they are in a better mood after playing.",

In addition to observational studies, randomized trials of nutritional supplements like vitamins, omega‐3 fatty acids, and folic acid provide evidence of the dietary impact on aggression. However, the exact mechanism of the diet‐aggression link is not well understood. The current article proposes that the gut microbiome plays an important role in the process, with the microbiota–gut–brain axis serving as such a mediating mechanism between diet and behavior. Based on animal and human studies, this review synthesizes a wide array of research across several academic fields: from the effects of dietary interventions on aggression, to the results of microbiota transplantation on socioemotional and behavioral outcomes, to the connections between early adversity, stress, microbiome, and aggression. Possibilities for integrating the microbiotic perspective with the more traditional, sociologically oriented theories in criminology are discussed, using social disorganization and self‐control theories as examples. To extend the existing lines of research further, the article considers harnessing the experimental potential of noninvasive and low‐cost dietary interventions to help establish the causal impact of the gut microbiome on aggressive behavior, while adhering to the high ethical standards and modern research requirements. Implications of this research for criminal justice policy and practice are essential: not only can it help determine whether the improved gut microbiome functioning moderates aggressive and violent behavior but also provide ways to prevent and reduce such behavior, alone or in combination with other crime prevention programs.",

Although the general aggression model posits that multiple person variables trigger aggression, the combined effects of multiple person variables are poorly understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the nature of the relation between gender, anger‐out, and reactive aggression. In particular, we were interested in whether the effects of anger‐out and gender are additive or multiplicative. Specifically, we tested whether men exhibit higher levels of aggression than women at a consistent ratio across all levels of anger‐out (i.e., the multiplicative model) or at a fixed amount depending on the level of anger‐out (i.e., the additive interaction model). To this end, undergraduate participants ( N = 203) completed a task in which they were falsely instructed that their objective was to respond more quickly than a same‐sex opponent. They were told that whoever responded more quickly would administer a white noise burst to the opponent and choose its intensity, which served as our measure of aggression. Compared to an additive interaction model, the multiplicative model exhibited a better fit. Specifically, men displayed proportionately more aggression than women with the same level of anger‐out. Research on and treatment for aggression should consider the multiplicative effects of factors related to aggression.",

We developed a mediation model to address these issues. A three‐wave study was conducted with a sample of 1203 qualifying Chinese undergraduates to test the model. The results showed that self‐control at Wave 1 negatively predicted reactive aggression at Wave 3 through mediating effects of hostile rumination and moral disengagement at Wave 2 at the same time, while self‐control at Wave 1 negatively predicted proactive aggression at Wave 3 only through moral disengagement at Wave 2. Furthermore, the longitudinal relationship between hostile rumination and moral disengagement is mutual. The current findings support our hypotheses regarding the mediation model of self‐control inhibiting reactive–proactive aggression and suggest that moral disengagement should be a common and basic variable to predict most kinds of aggression; further, hostile rumination only has a particular effect on reactive aggression. The present study used motivation theory to explain its mediation model, which develops aggressive theory regarding varied common influencing factors and underlying mediating mechanisms of reactive and proactive aggression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Early childhood relationships with teachers, parents, siblings, and peers are foundational factors for later social functioning. High rates of childhood aggression have been associated with negative developmental consequences, however, the associations between child aggression on the quality of these formative relationships have not been studied extensively. In a sample of young children attending preschool ( N = 114, Mage = 46.27 months, SD = 9.94, 40% girls), this study investigated associations between early childhood relational and physical aggression and the quality of concurrent teacher‐child and parent–child closeness and conflict, sibling relationship quality, and positive peer interactions and peer rejection. Early childhood relational and physical aggression was associated with negative teacher–child relationships, and this was true for boys and girls. Differential patterns of prediction were found for relational and physical aggression on the other relationship variables. Relational aggression strongly predicted more positive peer interactions, whereas physical aggression predicted fewer positive peer interactions and greater peer rejection. Early childhood relational aggression predicted higher levels of teacher‐child closeness, whereas physical aggression predicted lower levels of teacher–child closeness and fewer positive sibling interactions. These findings challenge common perceptions that aggression is negatively associated with relationship quality. Notably, relational aggression relative to physical aggression may be associated with some favorable relationship outcomes. We did not find support for an additive model of aggression whereby children who were both relationally and physically aggressive (co‐morbid) were at higher risk for negative relationship quality. Implications of these findings for future research and prevention and intervention are discussed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Trait aggression is often separated into two functional dimensions: reactive and proactive tendencies. Reactive aggression is the tendency to engage in emotionally driven aggressive responses to perceived provocation, whereas proactive aggression is the tendency to engage in premeditated aggressive behaviors in the service of goal attainment. To date, the majority of empirical investigations examining these interrelated constructs have done so using cross‐sectional data that have important limitations (e.g., recall bias). In the current study, we used an experience‐sampling approach to investigate similarities and differences in reactive and proactive aggression's relations with affective and interpersonal constructs in a sample of 477 US undergraduate students. Our results indicated that baseline reactive and proactive aggression scores were predictive of aggression‐related behavior, cognition, and affect in real‐world dyadic encounters. Additionally, although reactive aggression showed stronger relations with investigated maladaptive outcomes (e.g., negative affectivity, lack of interpersonal warmth), profile similarity analyses indicated that these trait aggression dimensions shared substantial overlap in their nomological nets.",

This social network study investigated whether dyad‐ and group‐level (dis)liking relationships affect perceptions of classmates' involvement in physical aggression and explored the moderating roles of classroom moral disengagement and defending norms. The study employed a longitudinal design with two time points 6 months apart, encompassing 27 classrooms and 632 early adolescents. Using multiplex stochastic actor‐oriented modeling, we found that liking, but not disliking, significantly influenced perceptions. Liking a classmate increased the likelihood of perceiving them as a defender. Moreover, students' own perceptions (aggressor, victim, and defender nominations) were shaped by the perceptions of classmates they liked, while classroom moral disengagement reduced this influence for defender nominations. Results on classroom defending norms were mixed. Our findings underscore the importance of accounting for students' liking relationships and classroom‐level norms to reduce bias in peer nominations and improve the accuracy of assessments of aggression‐related behaviors.",

While psychosocial and behavioral approaches are often put forward, the role of biological factors remains underexplored in a clinical context such as psychiatric hospitals. The dual‐hormone hypothesis (DHH) posits that low levels of cortisol combined with high levels of testosterone promote status‐seeking behaviors with some differences between sexes. This has yet to be studied among psychiatric inpatients. To explore the joint association of the DHH (cortisol and testosterone) and sex with psychiatric inpatient aggression. The sample included 375 psychiatric inpatients (206 women) from the Signature Biobank in Canada. Following their admission in a psychiatric hospital, participants provided hair and saliva for cortisol and testosterone analysis, respectively. Aggressive behaviors from the clinical files were reviewed from admission to discharge. Men with high salivary testosterone combined with low hair cortisol had higher odds of displaying aggression compared to men with high salivary testosterone and high hair cortisol. Men with low salivary testosterone and low hair cortisol had lower odds to perpetrate aggression compared to men with low salivary testosterone and high hair cortisol levels. The cortisol and testosterone interaction was not significant in women. Findings are consistent with the DHH for men. Given that the context hospitalization may trigger status‐seeking behaviors, actions could be taken such as identifying specific hormonal profiles at the time of admission to identify patients at risk of aggression, allowing for tailored care protocols.",

Results from 1228 elementary school students (52.92% boys; M age = 10.19, SD = 1.13) indicated that the associations between bullying and empathy are different for boys and girls. For boys, cognitive and affective empathy are negatively associated with bullying at the between level. At the within level, the only significant cross‐lagged path indicated that a positive deviation from the expected score of cognitive empathy at baseline predicted a positive deviation from the expected score in bullying behavior 5 months later. For girls, there were no associations between empathy and bullying at either the within‐ or between‐level. This study calls for further clarification of the direction of the relation between bullying and empathy before incorporating it into prevention programs.",

A random intercept cross‐lagged panel model was used to examine within‐ and between‐family variability in the reciprocal relations between caregiving environmental risk and child aggression from infancy to kindergarten age, and their contribution to early adolescent aggression, with prenatal substance exposure as an exogenous predictor, controlling for maternal education, child sex, and peer delinquency. The sample included 216 mother–child dyads (49% boys; 57.6% African American). Multimethod assessments were conducted at infancy, toddlerhood, early‐preschool, late‐preschool, kindergarten, and early adolescence. Positive cross‐lagged effects from child aggression to caregiving environmental risk revealed that after a temporary increase in aggression, children were exposed to more caregiving environmental risk a year later. Positive reciprocal paths from caregiving environmental risk at infancy and toddlerhood to child aggression a year later indicated that children had increased aggression at toddlerhood and early preschool when exposed to higher‐than‐expected levels of caregiving environmental risk the year prior. In contrast, caregiving environmental risk at early preschool and late preschool did not relate to child aggression a year later and caregiving environmental risk at kindergarten did not relate to early adolescent aggression. Findings highlight the ways in which child behavior impacts caregiving environmental risk and have implications for identifying and intervening with early childhood aggression and the contexts in which it occurs.",

However, little research has explored its prevalence and correlates. This study aims to address this gap by investigating homophobic cyberbullying through the theoretical lens of a socioecological stigma framework. Specifically, it examines the association between individual factors (socio‐emotional competencies), contextual factors (homophobic social norms), and homophobic cyberbullying. Additionally, it explores the moderating effect of socio‐emotional competencies on the relationship between homophobic social norms and social dominance orientation on homophobic cyberbullying. Parallel (in‐school and online) survey samples ( N = 3807) were collected among Italian youth ( M age = 16.69; SD = 1.97). A series of multiple linear regression models with two‐way and three‐way interaction effects were tested. Descriptive results indicated that heterosexual boys reported higher rates of homophobic cyberbullying. The regression analysis demonstrated that socio‐emotional competencies were negatively associated with homophobic cyberbullying, whereas homophobic social norms were positively related to it. Furthermore, socio‐emotional competencies mitigated the impact of homophobic social norms on the relationship between social dominance orientation and homophobic cyberbullying. The study underscores the urgent need for evidence‐based interventions that challenge and reshape gendered and heteronormative beliefs perpetuating homophobic cyberbullying, particularly among adolescent heterosexual boys, by encouraging critical reflection on masculinity and sexuality within educational settings and peer networks.",

While potential associations between metacognitive beliefs about worry and control, anger rumination, and anger expression have been reported, limited research focuses on these relationships within the context of driving anger. This study aims to examine the associations between metacognition, anger rumination, driving‐related anger (trait driving anger and aggressive anger expression) and crash risk (traffic penalty points and crash involvement), along with testing the psychometric properties of the Measure for Angry Drivers (MAD) among Chinese drivers. Participants () completed the MAD, the short form of the Metacognition Questionnaire (MCQ‐30), the Anger Rumination Scale (ARS), the short version of the Driving Anger Expression Inventory (DAX), and several questions related to their demographic background, traffic violations and crash involvements. A three‐factor structure comprising 23 items of MAD was confirmed (Danger posed by others, Travel delays and Aggression from others), demonstrating good reliability, convergent validity, and criterion validity. Additionally, drivers who were involved in crashes in the past 3 years reported higher total MAD scores. The structural model revealed that trait driving anger influenced anger rumination both directly and indirectly through increased maladaptive metacognitive beliefs. Also, trait driving anger and anger rumination jointly contributed to aggressive anger expression, which in turn significantly predicted crash risk. The current findings demonstrate that the Chinese version of MAD is appropriate for assessing trait driving anger and the necessity of regulating anger rumination and aggressive expressions by modifying maladaptive metacognitive beliefs.",

Subordinate male rats of mixed-sex groups maintained in visible burrow systems show high-magnitude changes in adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones and, in a subpopulation, disruptions in hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function. Changes in brain serotonin systems have been extensively documented in both colony subordinates and colony dominants, with other regional neurotransmitter system changes also indicated. The group experience seems to change a variety of behaviors both inside the colony situation and in tests run outside the colonies and may disrupt the relationship found in controls between hypothalamic pituitary adrenal response to an acute stressor and defensive behavior. Comparisons of these patterns of stress response with those of other chronic stress models such as learned helplessness and chronic mild stress suggest that, in terms of adrenal and gonadal steroid hormone response, subordination constitutes a more severe stressor. Some involvement of the serotonin system has been demonstrated for both subordination and more traditional models, and other systems may prove to be involved in both. However, a central feature of both learned helplessness and chronic mild stress paradigms is a specific criterion behavior or behaviors, emphasized as models for particular psychopathologies. Thus, learned helplessness and chronic mild stress studies have tended to emphasize the effects of pharmacological agents on these models, whereas work with subordination has been focused on analysis of the biobehavioral stress process itself.

Salivary testosterone levels and mood were measured before and after the games. Individual contribution to the outcome was assessed, and personal satisfaction and causal attribution of outcome were reported by players. Testosterone concentrations increased to near significance in Team 1 but not in Team 2, who attributed their victory more to luck than did Team 1. This latter team showed notably decreased vigor, and both teams showed fatigue at the end of the match. Post-match testosterone levels were only significantly, negatively related to external attribution. The results support the idea that causal attribution of the outcome is contributing to the variance of the testosterone responses to real confrontations where the outcome is highly dependent on personal merit.

It was predicted that a preference for violent games would be associated with negative externalizing characteristics, in particular aggressive emotions and behaviors, on the Youth Self‐Report (YSR), a standardized self‐report measure of adolescent problem behaviors. Thirty‐two 11‐ through 15‐year‐olds (17 girls) listed and categorized favorite electronic games into one of six predetermined categories and completed the YSR. MANOVA revealed significant relationships between a preference for violent games and the Thought Problems subscale ( P &lt; .01) and YSR Total Score ( P &lt; .05), with trends noted for the Internalizing ( P &lt; .06) and Anxious‐Depressed ( P &lt; .08) subscales. Expected relationships with externalizing behaviors, including aggression, were not found. However, across all YSR subscales, children with higher preference for violent games had more clinically significant elevations than those with low preference for violent games. On the Total Problems subscale, of the eight children receiving scores in the clinically significant range, six were in the High preference group (three boys and three girls). The failure to find the expected relationships between a preference for violent games and aggressive, externalizing behaviors is puzzling. It is possible that individuals with a preference for violent games may have high exposure to all forms of media violence. Their perceptions of their own behavior, in comparison, may not seem sufficiently aggressive to justify endorsement of problems in this area. Or, playing violent electronic games may promote a disconnection between the emotions normally associated with violence and violent acts. These explanations are consistent with a desensitization model where exposure to media violence decreases sensitivity to aggression. Aggr. Behav. 28:134–144, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Based on their within-home pair behavior, each pairmate was designated as a dominant or a subordinate. When the test encounters between unfamiliar males were analyzed with regard to whether the pairings consisted of two dominants, two subordinates, or a mixed pair, the pattern of play fighting was found to be attenuated. Both dominants and subordinates were more likely to initiate playful encounters, to respond defensively during these encounters, and to do so using adult-typical tactics of defense when paired with an unfamiliar rat that was dominant in its home cage. The mechanisms by which the home status of unfamiliar male rats can be identified by another male are discussed, particularly with regard to the role that play fighting may serve for this function. It is concluded that the data support the hypothesis that play fighting can be used by adult rats for social testing, which in this case seems to involve ascertaining the opponent's fighting capability.

    "abstract": "The primary objective of the present study was to assess the utility of (1) comorbid depression and (2) parasympathetic influence on cardiac function as markers for treatment response among aggressive preadolescent males. Inpatient records of 53 patients with conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (17 with a comorbid depressive disorder) were examined, including an intake electrocardiogram and daily tallies of several indices of aggressive behavior across 3 weeks of stay. The relations of comorbid depression, heart rate variability, and residualized heart rate (primarily of sympathetic origin) to treatment response were assessed through analyses of linear growth functions. Significant vagal tone by diagnostic status interactions were obtained for both frequency and duration indices of aggression, whereby nondepressed patients with high vagal tone deteriorated and depressed patients with high vagal tone improved during hospitalization. No such relation was found for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms. Patients in the comorbid group also exhibited greater heart rate variability than their nondepressed counterparts. Furthermore, residualized heart rate was predictive of maternal substance use and paternal incarcerations. These findings suggest complex relations among treatment response, comorbid depression, and emotion regulation in male preadolescents with severe behavior disorders. Additionally, the differential prediction afforded by vagal tone and residualized heart rate underscores the importance of assessing both parasympathetic and sympathetic indices of cardiac function as distinct physiological markers.

Linearity was assessed for each group on a weekly basis based on the Landau's index (h) and on the procedure described by Appleby [Appleby MC (1983): Animal Behaviour 31:600–608]. Week-to-week stability of the hierarchical structures was measured using the Burk's stability index (b) and Spearman rank correlation coefficients for the ranks of fishes in consecutive weeks. The two measures of stability showed a high level of concordance but the Spearman rank correlations were more conservative in detecting cases of stability. Although most dominance structures were linear they were unstable from week to week. Dominant individuals were less likely to experience rank reversals than subordinates. Rank reversals were especially likely among hierarchical neighbors. Dominance hierarchies did not stabilize in the time span of this study. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The mouse defense test battery (MDTB) has been designed to examine anxiogenic- or anxiolytic-like properties of psychoactive drugs through effects on specific defensive behaviors. In the present study, the MDTB was used to evaluate the potential contribution of genetic factors to these behaviors. The data revealed pronounced differences in several defense reactions among four inbred strains (BALB/c, C57BL/6, CBA, DBA/2) and one outbred (Swiss) mouse line. Thus, when subjects were introduced into the apparatus, Swiss and C57BL/6 displayed the highest levels of horizontal and vertical activities, while BALB/c and DBA/2 mice showed intermediate and CBA low activity rates. When subjects were chased by the rat, C57BL/6 mice used flight as the dominant defense strategy, while the defensive responses of BALB/c, C57BL/6, and DBA/2 mice consisted of flight reactions and risk assessment activities. However, when flight or escape was not possible, risk assessment became the predominant feature of the defense repertoire in the C57BL/6 mice. When defensive threat/attack behaviors were required, Swiss, BALB/c, DBA/2, and C57BL/6 mice showed very similar reactions in terms of the magnitude of the responses observed. CBA mice were poorly defensive in all these test situations. Finally, after the rat was removed from the test apparatus, Swiss, DBA/2, and C57BL/6 mice displayed more vertical activities than BALB/c mice. These latter, however, showed an increased level of ambulation compared to the activity recorded before the rat exposure. Together, these findings indicate that genetic factors contribute to defensive behaviors in this animal model of anxiety. The different behavioral profiles displayed by the strains used here may provide the means to obtain a better insight into the neurobehavioral mechanisms involved in anxiety-related disorders. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Research at the frontlines of wars shows that the realities of war are quite different from the public presentations of war. The experiences of those surviving in the midst of war are frequently worlds apart from the \"images\" of political violence (mis)portrayed in public media, formal military texts, the literature, and war museums. This has allowed for a number of myths about war and human aggression to hold sway in both academic and popular culture that, as the basis for policies, can actually further harm those subjected to war. For example, although the vast majority of cultural and military treatises on war focus on soldiers, more children than soldiers are killed in wars in the world today. If this core reality of war is omitted from analyses, solutions become impossible. On the other hand, people often look at statistics like these and decry the inevitability of aggression in human nature and society. Yet, data from combat soldiers have shown that through much of modern history, the majority of combat soldiers on the front lines do not fire their weapons, at least not at other humans. They do not flee war, but they cannot bring themselves to kill others. When these facts are excluded from public discourse on political violence, we sacrifice our potential for understanding the human capacity for peacebuilding. Without actual war zone research—research conducted at the front lines of wars—it is impossible to distinguish between fact and fiction in these formal presentations of war. In exploring some of the common myths about war and comparing them with data collected at the front lines, this article examines the question of why these myths emerge with such force and chronicles the cultural construction of aggression. In conclusion, the article suggests that a new kind of empiricism is necessary for studying such difficult, dangerous, and complex phenomena as political aggression and peacebuilding. It is an empiricism that necessitates both sophisticated methodological tools attuned to wartime realities and theoretical insights capable of explaining them. Examples take the reader through key dilemmas and solutions in the search for a more representative, and responsible, understanding of political violence and peace. Aggr.

The participants were 70 imprisoned male offenders, who were classified using the Direct and Indirect Prisoner Behaviour Checklist (DIPC) as one of four 'bully' groups: pure bully, pure victim, bully/victim, or not involved. Participants also completed the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), a measure of aggression and hostility. The majority of the prisoners reported behaviors indicative of bullying, with 42.9 percent classified in the bully/victim group and 12.9 percent as pure bullies. 15.7 percent of participants were classified as pure victims, while 28.6 percent did not report any involvement in bullying. Bully/victims scored higher than participants who were not involved in bullying on the Hostility scale and Total score of the AQ. A number of correlations were found between the AQ scores and number of bully behaviors perpetrated. These suggested there is an overlap between the constructs measured by the AQ and type of bullying behaviors perpetrated. The number of bullying behaviors experienced was only correlated with the Hostility scale. The results are discussed in terms of previous research and their implications for theory and practice.

Earlier findings from work in this area suggest that exposure to the bar environment increases a woman's risk for more severe aggression. The data being used to test the proposed model are from a survey of 198 women bar drinkers in western New York State. These women described bar-related victimization that ranged from verbal aggression (e.g., threats) through severe physical and sexual violence (e.g., assault and rape). Younger age, history of victimization, greater negative affect, and more frequent drinking in bars were predictive of more severe bar-related victimization during the past year. These findings are discussed in terms of women's risk for victimization in bars and needed areas of future research. Aggr. Behav. 25:349–364, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Factor analysis revealed three factors: physical aggression (killing, torture, and hitting), direct verbal aggression (shouting and rage), and indirect verbal aggression (being ironic and hindering). The basic factor structure of the Japanese, the Spanish, and the USA samples was similar. In all samples, men showed a higher justification of physical aggressive acts in any situation and of indirect verbal aggression in nondefensive circumstances. Cultural differences were found in the degree of justification of the three factors: in all kinds of situations, Japanese students showed a lower justification of indirect verbal aggression but a higher justification of direct verbal aggression than USA and Spain samples. Physical aggression in defensive situations is justified more by Americans than by Japanese and Spanish students. These findings suggest the existence of a common basic moral code about physical aggressive acts, but there seems to be a cultural influence on moral codes concerning verbal aggressive acts. Oriental cultures, with an interdependent construal of self, seem to be more permissive of direct verbal aggression compared with Western cultures, but they have less tolerance for indirect verbal aggression. There were practically no significant differences between American and Spanish scores. Aggr. Behav. 25:185–195, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In a subsequent laboratory experiment, in which participants had an opportunity to aggress against the source of positive or negative feedback about a personal essay that they had written, mate value again predicted increased aggression, whereas global self-esteem predicted decreased aggression.

We propose that testosterone affects competitive status-seeking and that under certain circumstances (including youth) this is expressed as aggression. Involvement in aggression in turn is associated with adherence to an instrumental social representation of aggression which justifies aggression as a means of imposing control over others and increasing self-esteem. Measures of salivary testosterone, masculinity, preferred social representation of aggression, and multiple aggression scales were collected from an undergraduate sample of 119 men. An Aggression factor was derived from principle components analysis of the aggression measures. The strongest correlates of Aggression were holding an instrumental social representation of aggression and youth. Testosterone showed no significant relationship to the single or aggregate measures of aggression or to any of the other psychometric measures. We suggest ways in which previous work may have over-estimated the strength of the association between circulating testosterone and aggression and discuss the possible relationships between age, social representation, and aggression.

An analysis of which physical clues are used by females to assess dominance suggests that body weight may be the most important attribute.

Furthermore, the greater effect of weight compared to that of horn size on the rank/age correlation supports our conclusion.",

For males, kappa coefficients indicated good statistical agreement between arrest records and self-report measures for 7 of the 12 types of crimes. Statistical agreement, however, may not be the most meaningful yardstick to judge concordance. Additional analyses reveal that for almost all of the crimes examined, one third or more of those with an arrest record for the crime failed to reveal this information on the self-report measure. Arrests for both some high-frequency, less serious crimes and some low-frequency, more serious crimes were not revealed in the subjects' self-reports. An examination of the unique information gained from self-reports found that the subjects most often reported committing public disorder crimes for which they were not caught (over 30%) and were least likely to self-report crimes against people (less than 10%). Furthermore, subjects with more convictions were more likely to accurately self-report their criminal involvement. Since both self-report and official records each contribute unique information and reflect different sources of error, it is proposed that a combination of both types of records is the most inclusive indicator of criminal activity in adulthood.

    "abstract": "Comparisons of tactics of fighting between species are often difficult to make since the body targets attacked may differ. Thus it becomes difficult to assess whether differences in fighting tactics are due to species-specific differences in the tactics themselves or due to the different targets attacked. A solution to this problem is to analyse the tactics of a species that attacks different targets under different circumstances. In this way, differences in tactics can be more readily attributed to differences in targets. In this study, resident male northern grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster) were tested against intruding male conspecifics and against laboratory mice (Mus musculus domesticus). Conspecifics were mainly bitten on the lower dorsum, whereas prey were bitten and killed by bites to the nape of the neck. Therefore, it was possible to analyze the tactics of attack by grasshopper mice when attacking different body targets. For example, in order to defend the lower dorsum and the nape, both intruding conspecifics and prey adopted an upright defensive posture. Resident grasshopper mice used the lateral attack tactic to gain access to the lower flanks but not the nape. This illustrates that the lateral attack tactic is not merely a tactic suitable for overcoming the upright defense tactic, but is used in this context only when the target attacked is on the opponent's posterior dorsum. Such withinpecies comparison enables the identification of the contextual rules which govern the use of fighting tactics. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Specifically, we have examined the effects of testosterone on metabolism in cultured C2C12 myotubules, using a silicon microphysiometer. The instrument monitors cellular extrusion of protons and acidic metabolites, and such extrusion is directly linked to ATP hydrolysis, thus providing a real-time measure of cellular metabolism. Testosterone caused a small but significant increase in metabolism. The most striking feature of this effect was its rapidity, in that it occurred within 3 hr. This rapid enhancement of metabolism suggested that testosterone might be enhancing substrate uptake even more rapidly. Indeed, we found that testosterone increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake within 1 min. The rapidity of this effect seemed to preclude mediation by classical intracellular steroid receptors. In support of this, we were unable to detect specific intracellular binding of testosterone. These findings show that testosterone can exert rapid anabolic effects on substrate transport and metabolism in myotubules. Should this finding general to muscle in vivo, it suggests that relatively small individual differences in testosterone profiles, in response to various social interactions, may have very real consequence for subsequent muscle physiology. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic and environmental factors influencing teacher and parental rated aggression in boys and girls, asking whether the magnitude of these effects is similar across rater and sex. The study is part of an ongoing nationwide twin‐family study of behavioral development and health habits carried out in Finland. The sample consisted of 1651 twin pairs (264 monozygotic male, 300 monozygotic female, 292 dizygotic male, 278 dizygotic female, and 517 dizygotic opposite‐sex twin pairs), representing subsets of five 11‐ to 12‐year‐old twin cohorts (b. 1983–1987). The data were collected using the teacher and parental rating forms of the Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory. Structural equation models of sex‐limitation assessed sex differences in genetic and environmental influences on aggression. The results suggested significant genetic, common environmental, and specific environmental effects on aggression in both boys and girls, but the best fitting model differed depending on the informant. For both ratings, boys showed lower levels of heritability and higher levels of common environment than girls. In addition, the teacher rating data also suggested the presence of either sex‐specific common environmental effects or sex‐specific genetic effects. Support is provided also for sibling contrast effects, either at the behavioral level or as a rater bias. Aggr. Behav. 29:55–68, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Women in cohabiting relationships are about nine times more likely to be killed by their partner than are women in marital relationships. Within marital relationships, the risk of uxoricide decreases with a woman’s age. Within cohabiting relationships, in contrast, middle‐aged women are at greatest risk of uxoricide. Paralleling the uxoricide victimization rates, uxoricide perpetration rates are highest for young married men and for middle‐aged cohabiting men. Uxoricide risk generally increases with greater age difference between partners. These findings provide the first national‐level replication of uxoricide risk patterns reported for a national‐level Canadian sample. Discussion highlights future research directions, including identifying why women in cohabiting relationships incur greater risk of uxoricide than do women in marital relationships. Aggr.

Two studies were conducted to investigate whether legal punishment of the perpetrator reduces victims' feelings of revenge. A cross‐sectional study of 174 crime victims revealed that punishment severity does not predict feelings of revenge at a time several years after the trial. A longitudinal study of 31 crime victims revealed that, for the time interval from a few weeks before the trial to a few weeks after the trial, punishment severity significantly predicts a decrease in feelings of revenge; nevertheless intraindividual and interindividual stability of these feelings was high. Taken together, results of the two studies suggest that perpetrator punishment only partially, and moreover only transitorily, satisfies victims' feelings of revenge. Therefore, satisfaction of victims' feelings of revenge cannot be taken as empirical justification for tightening of sentencing norms. Aggr. Behav. 30:62–70, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study provides an analysis of offender‐victim interactions in 223 cases of sexual violence committed in gangs. Cases were derived from archival sources such as law reports. A multivariate analysis revealed four interpersonal themes (dominance, submission, co‐operation, and hostility) previously identified in studies of lone sexual assault [Alison and Stein, Vicious Circles: Accounts of stranger sexual assault reflect abusive variants of conventional interactions. J Forensic Psychiatry 12:515–538, 2001]. These themes have also been identified in many other forms of human relating [Wiggins, An informal history of the interpersonal circumplex tradition. J Pers Assess 66:217–233, 1996] and conform to a structure known as the interpersonal circumplex. The circumplex has previously been used to conceptualise the relationships between individuals in terms of dynamic interactions that are mutually influencing. Thus, dominance elicits submission and submission elicits dominance. Each interpersonal style could be further subdivided according to the use of either verbally or physically abusive strategies. Point‐Biserial correlations with other aspects of the offence (e.g., mobility of the group, post‐offence treatment of the victim) provided additional support for these conceptually different themes and demonstrated that gang rape represents a distorted and violent form of interpersonal relating. Further, this dynamic interaction emerges not just at an individual level, but at a group level, suggesting that the thematic concepts underpinning the interpersonal circumplex can be extended to group activity and sexually aggressive behaviour.

    "abstract": "Abstract Resident‐intruder (R‐I) tests can be used to measure the aggressive temperament of domestic pigs ( Sus scrofa ), and have previously been shown to predict the severity and persistence of aggression when unfamiliar pigs are mixed. To study the consistency of individual differences in aggressiveness over time, 112 pigs (eight from each of fourteen litters) were given two R‐I tests at each of three ages (46, 80, and 113 days). Pigs were R‐I tested singly in an arena within the home pen, where a smaller unfamiliar intruder pig was introduced to a resident pig. Latency to the first attack by the resident was recorded, and the test was stopped as soon as an attack occurred, otherwise the test lasted five minutes. Pigs from eight of the litters used here had been allowed to mix with another litter prior to weaning (days 10–30; socialised), while pigs in six litters remained in littermate groups (control). To determine whether consistency would survive the effects of social disruption, pigs were mixed into new groups on two occasions between the first and second test, then remained in these groups until the third test. Evidence of consistency was found, despite the social disruption. Socialised pigs were more aggressive than controls, females were more aggressive than males, and certain litters were more aggressive than others. After adjusting for these, consistent differences between individuals were still evident. Consistency was higher between the second and third tests compared to the first and second, possibly because of stable group membership or the effects of age or experience. In support of the idea that social experience improves consistency, socialised pigs were more consistent than controls throughout. Evidence of consistent individual differences in aggressive temperament suggests that breeding or changes to early life experiences could have a long‐lasting influence on aggressive behaviour in pigs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Research is beginning to suggest that elevated levels of anger may influence responses in traditional cognitive tests of attention. To date research has focused upon nonforensic samples, and trait and state levels of anger. If individuals who are habitually aggressive demonstrate processing bias then it is likely that other constructs such as aggressiveness, hostility, and impulsivity will also be correlated with any bias performance. We attempted to extend the research by also considering the role of aggressive experience and impulsivity in such bias by using a group of offenders (n=50) from prisons in the North of England and undergraduates (n=30) from a university in the North of England. We hypothesised that violent offenders (as classified by their index offence) would demonstrate delayed responses when presented with aggressive stimuli as targets in a thematically primed version of the traditional dot‐probe task, due to the activation of associated representational structures by a violently themed vignette when compared to a neutral vignette. We also hypothesised that the violent offenders would become distracted when searching for a neutral word target which was surrounded by aggressive words in a visual search task [Cohen et al., 1998] leading to delayed responses compared to a neutral word surrounded by negatively or positively themed emotion words. Finally, we hypothesised that undergraduates with elevated levels of aggressiveness would also show similar (albeit attenuated) biases for these materials. Violent offenders demonstrated significant response biases to aggression words in both tests. This effect was also found in the aggressive undergraduates (as classified by their scores on the Buss‐Perry Aggression Questionnaire). These data confirm the saliency of aggression words to aggressive individuals across populations. The objective nature of these tests, together with their resilience to deception, may offer a useful tool in the assessment and treatment of aggressive individuals. Aggr.

Finally, perceived self-control over aggressive impulses significantly predicted all three types of aggressive behaviour, but it was unrelated to sex and therefore did not operate as a mediator.

The understanding of violence in schizophrenic patients requires consideration of psychiatric symptomatology. Objective: This study investigated the relationship between violent behavior and psychiatric symptomatology in schizophrenic patients. Method: One hundred and thirteen patients were recruited. Thirteen patients were excluded due to concomitant substance abuse six months prior to the assessment. Diagnoses were based on the SCID‐I. Psychotic symptom severity was assessed with the PANSS. Violent behaviors were assessed with the OAS. Results: Violent behaviors were associated with more severe psychotic symptomatology including hallucinations, delusions, excitement, poor impulse control, and thinking disturbances. Conclusions: Patients with exacerbation of psychotic symptomatology have an increased risk of violent behavior. It is necessary to determine which subtypes of hallucinations and delusions are implicated in the association of schizophrenia and violent behavior. Violent behavior in schizophrenic patients is a heterogeneous phenomenon best explained in the context of specific symptoms associated with violence and course of illness. The retrospective assessment of the variables raises methodological questions concerning the reliability of measurement of the impact of psychotic symptoms on violence. Aggr.

Stepwise hierarchical regression analysis showed that age was negatively related to driving aggression, whereas annual mileage had a positive relationship with driving aggression. Dispositional aggressiveness was a significant predictor of driving aggression. Of the two components of sex role orientation, only femininity was associated with driving aggression, with higher femininity scores predicting lower aggressive driving scores. Masculinity failed to predict aggressive driving, as did the interaction of masculinity and femininity. In combination, the predictors explained 29% of the variance in women's aggressive driving.

    "abstract": "There is a robust relationship between the salience of stimulus materials presented in the Emotional Stroop task and inhibition of response in clinical populations. Researchers have now found information-processing biases in both forensic and non-forensic samples presented with threatening or aggressive stimuli [Cohen et'al., 1998; Eckhardt and Cohen, 1997; Smith and Waterman, 2003; Van Honk et'al., 2001]. We sought to explore sex differences in processing words relating to acts of direct and indirect aggression using a group of undergraduates (50 males and 50 females). Participants also completed self-report questionnaires (AQ and EXPAGG) to allow some consideration of the relationship between objective and subjective measures. We predicted that males would demonstrate delayed responses when presented with words relating to acts of direct aggression. We also predicted that high levels of physical aggression would be the best predictor of bias for direct aggression words, high levels of verbal aggression would be the best predictor of bias for indirect aggression words, physical aggression would predict bias in males, and verbal aggression would predict bias in females. Males demonstrated a perceptual bias for words relating to acts of direct aggression, taking significantly longer to correctly colour name direct aggression words. Females were slower to correctly colour name indirect aggression words, but not significantly so. Verbal aggression, as expected, predicted bias performance for indirect aggression words but anger rather than physical aggression was the best predictor of bias for direct aggression words. Gender was a predictor for bias with both sets of words. Contrary to our predictions, it was observed that a high level of physical aggression was the best predictor of bias in both males and females.

Two statistical subgroups of 16 males and 28 females that were adults at the start of the project and that survived until its completion were studied intensively. There were significant season and sex differences in all groups: males were much more aggressive than females, and males were most aggressive during the fall and and winter mating season; females were most aggressive during the spring and summer birth season. Only the 16 adult males increased their frequency of aggressive behavior as the population density increased. This increase was due to the greater number of potential antagonists available each year.",

Among identified antigay assailants, motivations for one earlier assault (i.e. sexual prejudice, peer dynamics, thrill seeking) were also assessed. Results indicated that anger fully mediated the relationship between sexual prejudice and antigay aggression, partially mediated the effect of peer dynamics on antigay aggression, and did not account for the relationship between thrill seeking and antigay aggression.

One such factor is value placed on children, those individuals who have greater affection for children or who are more supportive of devoting national resources toward meeting children's needs being more supportive of nuclear disarmament and a nuclear test moratorium. This relationship was found in a well-educated group of adults with a special interest in foreign affairs as well as in college student populations. A significant and strong relationship between the value placed on war as an instrument of foreign policy and a pronuclear armament stance was also found in each of these two samples. Measures of individual aggression, however, were minimally and inconsistently related to the attitude towards nuclear armament-disarmament and the attitude towards war measures. The possible role of patriotic and nationalistic values was also explored. Patriotism or love of and pride in one's country was shown to be functionally distinct from nationalism or the view that one's country is superior to and should be more powerful than other nations. Patriotism but not nationalism was found to be positively correlated with early paternal sattachment while nationalism but not patriotism, was found to be significantly related to pronuclear armament views. The findings from this series of studies indicate that the analysis of individual differences in nuclear armament-disarmament policy attitudes has heuristic usefulness and may be useful for social policy in this area.",

Physiological arousal (heart rate (HR)), priming of aggressive thoughts, and state hostility were also measured to test their possible mediation on the relationship between playing the violent game (VG) and aggression. The participants—148 undergraduate students—were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions: two groups played a violent computer game (Unreal Tournament), and the other two a non‐violent game (Motocross Madness), half with a VR device and the remaining participants on the computer screen. In order to assess the game effects the following instruments were used: a BIOPAC System MP100 to measure HR, an Emotional Stroop task to analyze the priming of aggressive and fear thoughts, a self‐report State Hostility Scale to measure hostility, and a competitive reaction‐time task to assess aggressive behavior. The main results indicated that the violent computer game had effects on state hostility and aggression. Although no significant mediation effect could be detected, regression analyses showed an indirect effect of state hostility between playing a VG and aggression. Aggr.

The present research sought to confirm and extend Barber's [2000a] finding, using murder data from the United Nations and homicides from World Health Organization that are of higher quality than the INTERPOL data, and using more rigorous controls. In addition to level of economic development, control variables included, income inequality, urbanization, population density, the number of police, and whether the country was a major center of illegal drug trafficking. Regression analyses with all controls found that killings in both data sets increased with declines in the male proportion of the population.

Zero-order correlations showed that perceived benefits, self-control, and perceived costs were most closely associated with perpetration of bullying, and that lack of self-control was weakly associated with victimization. Height and weight were unrelated to bullying or victimization. In a standard regression analyses, perceived benefits was the strongest predictor of bullying perpetration, with lack of self-control contributing further; all three variables made a significant contribution when direct aggression was the criterion. Mediation analysis showed that a combined cost-benefit measure partially mediated the association between self-control and both bullying and direct aggression.

A correlational analysis of the data supported the hypothesis that moderately hypoglycemic subjects would be more aggressive than the normoglycemic subjects. The present paper responds to questions raised about this study and describes the results of an additional test of the hypoglycemia-aggression hypothesis. The dependent variable in this follow-up study is fantasy aggression. Aggression scores were derived from Sentence Completion Test protocols for the same sample of subjects used in the first study. The results indicate a significant correlation between glycemic condition and aggression scores (Biserial, 0.57), thus providing further confirmation of the hypoglycemia-aggression hypothesis.",

Brief exposures of intruders to intact colonies may produce misleading results but long-term test sessions increase the likelihood that intruders will be either killed or severely injured. We describe a simple modification of the colony-intruder procedure whereby intruders can successfully defend themselves during long sessions and thus reduce serious injury.

Three types of aggression (physical, verbal, and indirect), constructive conflict resolution, third-party intervention, withdrawal, and victimization were examined using the Peer-Estimated Conflict Behavior (PECOBE) inventory [Bjorkquist and Osterman, 1998]. Also, all respondents rated peer and self-popularity with same-sex classmates and personal attitude to school. The sample consisted of 212 Russian adolescents (101 boys, 111 girls) aged between 11 and 15 years. The findings attest to significant sex differences in aggression and conflict resolution patterns. Boys scored higher on physical and verbal aggression, and girls on indirect aggression. Girls were socially more skillful than boys in the use of peaceful means of conflict resolution (they scored higher on constructive conflict resolution and third-party intervention). The attributional discrepancy index (ADI) scores were negative for all three types of aggression in both sexes. Verbal aggression is apparently more condemned in boys than in girls. ADI scores were positive for constructive conflict resolution and third-party intervention in both genders, being higher in boys. In girls, verbal aggression was positively correlated with popularity. In both sexes, popularity showed a positive correlation with constructive conflict resolution and third-party intervention, and a negative correlation with withdrawal and victimization. Boys who liked school were popular with same-sex peers and scored higher on constructive conflict resolution. Girls who liked school were less aggressive according to peer rating. They also rated higher on conflict resolution and third-party intervention. Physical aggression was related to age. The results are discussed in a cross-cultural perspective.",

Further analysis of this effect, using specific adrenergic antagonists, revealed that neither a- nor Padrenergic systems appeared to be responsible for the behavioral effect of chlorpromazine. Injections of haloperidol into the same region, however, yielded a reduction similar to that produced by chlorpromazine, while dopamine injections resulted in significant elevations in both fighting and pain sensitivity. No effect on any of these behavioral measures was obtained following injection of any of the agents into the basolateral amygdala. These results suggest that the observed effect of catecholamine injections in the corticomedial amygdala is related to changes in pain sensitivity mediated by dopamine.",

T and C increased only during Kumite contest and pre‐ and post‐competition C levels were higher in losers than winners.

Little research has, of yet, considered the relation between psychopathy and indirect forms of aggression. The current research sought to investigate the relationship between psychopathy and indirect aggression in a noncriminal sample. The results indicated that there was a strong relationship between psychopathic traits and indirect aggression, with strong correlations between indirect aggression and both factor 1 (coldheartedness) and factor 3 (impulsive antisociality). This association remained significant even after the effects of direct aggression had been controlled for. Path analysis indicated that both direct and indirect aggression was underpinned by the same psychopathy factors. This suggests that high psychopathy scorers will utilize direct and indirect aggression equally and, as such, the choice of one type of aggression over the other may be dependant on either situational factors or external moderators.",

    "abstract": "Various studies have found that viewing physical or relational aggression in the media can impact subsequent engagement in aggressive behavior. However, this has rarely been examined in the context of relationships. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the connection between viewing various types of aggression in the media and perpetration of aggression against a romantic partner. A total of 369 young adults completed a variety of questionnaires asking for their perpetration of various forms of relationship aggression. Participants' exposure to both physical and relational aggression in the media was also assessed. As a whole, we found a relationship between viewing aggression in the media and perpetration of aggression; however, this depended on the sex of the participant and the type of aggression measured. Specifically, exposure to physical violence in the media was related to engagement in physical aggression against their partner only for men. However, exposure to relational aggression in the media was related to romantic relational aggression for both men and women. Aggr. Behav. 37:56–62, 2011. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Five factors were associated with antisocial behavior in multivariate analyses: post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, deployment‐related stressors, combat exposure, younger age, and being divorced. PTSD symptoms had a stronger association with antisocial behavior than any other variable. A unique and important finding of this study was the association between deployment‐related stressors and a higher incidence of antisocial behavior. Because deployment‐related stressors are potentially modifiable, the military may be able to address them in concrete ways such as by shortening deployments and improving communication with home.

In newly formed groupings, plasma cortisol measured higher with each step down in the new dominance hierarchy, the effect attenuating by day 8. Although the partial correlation between frequencies of hostility behavior and plasma cortisol level was low (r = 0.05) when holding fear constant, the partial correlation between cortisol and fear behaviors, holding hostility behavior constant, was 0.86. The data provide evidence that corticosteroid elevations during social stress are related to behavior suggestive of fear and not aggression and are dependent upon dominance rank, the level of dominance competition, and previous dominance history.",

The interactions of the males in six colonies of trapped rats were highly \"stressful;\" 61% died; and most of the survivors lost weight and had greatly enlarged adrenals.

The adrenals of alphas and betas weighed about the same as those of the controls. In one of the 12 colonies of domestic rats one male behaved like a wild male; but in the other colonies the males gained in body weight and their adrenal weights resembled those of the controls. In three colonies of lab-wild rats 22% of the males died, but there was no evidence of males of different status.

Participants were randomly assigned to play a violent or nonviolent video game before completing a task in which they could behave aggressively. Results showed that participants high in trait anger were the most aggressive, but only if they first played a VVG. This relationship held while statistically controlling for dimensions other than violent content on which game conditions differed (e.g. frustration, arousal).

When produced in rats which had remained nonkillers following olfactory bulb removal, the raphé lesion clearly enhanced both the general and the emotional responsiveness; it provoked initiation of mouse-killing behavior in about 75% of the lesioned animals.

    "abstract": "Abstract Executive processes have been posited as important regulators of externalizing problems (EP), but there has been little research on the relation between executive dysfunction and EP in early childhood. During the preschool period, maturation of the prefrontostriatal circuitry parallels increases in inhibitory control (IC). Poor IC development could result in elevated levels of aggressive, disruptive, and impulsive behavior. In this investigation, the development of the relation between IC and EP was examined in preschool and early elementary school children using the Day/Night and Tapping tasks. Children with more EP made more incorrect responses on both IC tasks, consistently across age and sex. The associations between EP and response latencies differed across children, however, with longer latencies on the Tapping task being most characteristic for boys with high levels of EP. This association was not apparent for girls. Two prominent aspects of early EP, aggressive and inattentive behavior, showed only weak unique associations with IC performance. These findings imply that diminished IC accompanies elevated EP as early as the preschool years, and that this decrement persists into the elementary school‐age years for both girls and boys, and that accuracy and response latency may confer different information about the development of IC.

Although there were subtle differences among the three measures with regard to their relationships with associated variables, overall the patterns of relationships were similar as well as distinct from the pattern for direct aggression. Factor analysis of scores for measures of aggression revealed that the indirect and relational measures composed a single factor of nondirect aggression, separate from direct aggression.

As predicted, the collectivistic society reported more conflict-reducing behaviors and less verbal or physical aggression. However, the effect of individualism/collectivism was moderated by both the ingroup/outgroup status of the target and gender of the participant. Chinese and US women did not differ on any measure. However, of the four groups, Chinese men reported the most conflict-reducing behaviors and the least physical aggression, whereas US men reported the fewest conflict-reducing behaviors and the greatest physical aggression. As predicted, conflict-reducing behaviors were more common in the ingroup condition and both verbal and physical aggression was more common in the outgroup condition. However, the latter were moderated by gender of the participant. US men reported greater physical aggression than any other group. Neither gender nor society had any effect on the level of indirect aggression. There were no gender or individualism/collectivism effects on indirect aggression. Observed gender effects were attributed to differences in how collectivistic and individualistic societies conceptualize masculinity. The effect sizes associated with the ingroup/outgroup condition were consistently and substantially larger than effect sizes associated with individualism/collectivism or gender. Aggr.

This study examined the tendency of UK youth to engage in displaced aggression (aggression aimed at undeserving targets) and examined the relationship among gang affiliation, ruminative thought, and aggression levels. Students in three London schools were asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed levels of gang affiliation, rumination about aversive events, and a tendency to engage in displaced aggression. Our analyses found a three-way interaction between gang affiliation, rumination, and gender, such that males who were high in affiliation and rumination had the greatest tendency to displace aggression toward innocent others. Additionally, it was shown that rumination could account for a significant part of the correlation between gang affiliation and displaced aggression. Furthermore, regression analyses showed that even after controlling for trait aggression, anger, hostility, and irritability, rumination remained a significant predictor of displaced aggression. The implications for understanding gang-related aggression and for conducting future research in this area were discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the effect of situational variables on whether third parties intervene in conflicts in barroom settings, and whether they are aggressive or not when they intervene. Based on research on bystander intervention in emergencies, we hypothesized that third parties would be most likely to become involved in incidents with features that convey greater danger of serious harm. The situational variables indicative of danger were severity of aggression, whether the aggression was one‐sided or mutual, gender, and level of intoxication of the initial participants in the conflict. Analyses consist of cross‐tabulations and three‐level Hierarchical Logistic Models (with bar, evening, and incidents as levels) for 860 incidents of verbal and physical aggression from 503 nights of observation in 87 large bars and clubs in Toronto, Canada. Third party involvement was more likely during incidents in which: (1) the aggression was more severe; (2) the aggression was mutual (vs. one‐sided) aggression; (3) only males (vs. mixed gender) were involved; and (4) participants were more intoxicated. These incident characteristics were stronger predictors of non‐aggressive third party involvement than aggressive third party involvement. The findings suggest that third parties are indeed responding to the perceived danger of serious harm. Improving our knowledge about this aspect of aggressive incidents is valuable for developing prevention and intervention approaches designed to reduce aggression in bars and other locations. Aggr.

The chicken provides a unique animal model to study the effects of embryonic stressors on childhood and adolescent behavior. Manipulations to the egg can be made in the absence of confounding maternal effects from treatment. Eggs were injected with 50 μL of excess 5‐HT (10 μg/egg), 8‐OH‐DPAT (a 5‐HT1A receptor agonist; 16 μg/egg), or saline on day 0 prior to the 21 days incubation. Injections were performed at 0.5 cm below the shell. Behavior was analyzed at 9 weeks of age and again at the onset of sexual maturity (18 weeks). Hens treated with excess embryonic 5‐HT exhibited significantly less aggressive behaviors at 9 weeks of age compared to both 5‐HT1A agonist treated and saline hens ( P &lt; 0.05), and at 18 weeks of age compared to saline control birds only ( P &lt; 0.05). Excess embryonic 5‐HT also increased fearfulness response ( P &lt; 0.05) as tested by duration of tonic immobility. Increased degree of fluctuating asymmetry at 18 weeks in 5‐HT‐treated birds ( P &lt; 0.05) suggests that excess 5‐HT in early embryonic stages may create a developmental instability, causing phenotypic variations. These results showed that modification of the serotonergic system during early embryonic development alters its functions in mediating aggressive and fearful or anxious behaviors. Prenatal modification of the serotonergic system has long lived implications on both physiology and behavior, especially aggressive and fearful behaviors. Aggr. Behav. 39:91–98, 2013.

To improve the specificity of current models of negative parenting and offspring CP , we explored the potential moderating role of child sex in a sample of 179 5‐ to 10‐year‐old ethnically diverse boys and girls with and without attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) who were assessed using multiple methods (i.e., rating scales, semistructured interviews) and informants (i.e., parents, teachers). Controlling for children's age, race‐ethnicity, and ADHD diagnostic status (i.e., ADHD vs. non‐ ADHD ), inconsistent discipline was positively associated with offspring aggression and rule‐breaking behavior, whereas harsh punishment was positively associated with aggression, rule‐breaking behavior, and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms. Furthermore, child sex significantly moderated the association of inconsistent discipline and aggression and rule‐breaking behavior, such that inconsistent discipline was positively associated with CP for boys, but not for girls. Given the centrality of negative parenting to theories of and efficacious interventions for aggression and CP , we discuss these findings within a developmental psychopathology framework and consider their implications for intervention.

    "abstract": "It is well understood in aggression research that males tend to exhibit higher levels of physical aggression than females. Yet there are still a number of gaps in our understanding of variation in sex differences in children's aggression, particularly in contexts outside North America. A key assumption of social role theory is that sex differences vary according to gender polarization, whereas sexual selection theory accords variation to the ecological environment that consequently affects male competition [Archer, J. (2009). Behavioral and Brain Sciences , 32 , 249–311; Kenrick, D., &amp; Griskevicious, V. (2009). More holes in social roles [Comment]. Behavioral and Brain Sciences , 32 , 283–285]. In the present paper, we explore these contradicting theoretical frameworks by examining data from a longitudinal study of a culturally diverse sample of 863 children at ages 7–13 in Zurich, Switzerland. Making use of the large proportion of children from highly diverse immigrant background we compare the size of the sex difference in aggression between children whose parents were born in countries with low and with high levels of gender inequality. The results show that sex differences in aggression are generally larger among children with parents from high gender inequality backgrounds. However, this effect is small in comparison to the direct effect of a child's biological sex. We discuss implications for future research on sex differences in children's aggression. Aggr.

    "abstract": "An emerging literature suggests that temporary deficits in the ability to inhibit impulsive urges may be proximally associated with intimate partner aggression. The current study examined the experience of alcohol use and the depletion of self‐control in the prediction of relationship functioning. Daily diary data collected from 118 heterosexual couples were analyzed using parallel multi‐level Actor–Partner Interdependence Models to assess the effects of heavy episodic drinking and depletion of self‐control across partners on outcomes of participant‐reported daily arguing with and anger toward an intimate partner. Heavy episodic drinking among actors predicted greater arguing but failed to interact with either actor or partner depletion. We also found that greater arguing was reported on days of high congruent actor and partner depletion. Both actor and partner depletion, as well as their interaction, predicted greater partner‐specific anger. The current results highlight the importance of independently assessing partner effects (i.e., depletion of self‐control), which interact dynamically with disinhibiting actor effects, in the prediction of daily adverse relationship functioning. Results offer further support for the development of prospective individualized and couples‐based interventions for partner conflict. Aggr. Behav. 40:440–450, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several studies reported a relationship between immune system activation and anger expression. Consequently, the aim of this study was to explore immunitary molecular mechanisms that potentially underlie anger expression. To this end, we applied the F rustration— A ggression Theory in a contact sport model, utilizing the nearing of sporting events to trigger anger feelings. In parallel, we evaluated the activation of immune system at m RNA levels. We enrolled 20 amateur rugby players (age ± SD , 27.2 ± 4.5) who underwent psychological assessment to evaluate anger, with the State‐Trait Anger Expression Inventory‐2 (STAXI‐2), before rugby matches; at the same time blood samples were taken to analyze the variations of gene expression by microarray. During the 2 hr before each game, a significant increase was verified in the R age S tate ( RS ) score compared to the score ascertained 72 hr before. At the same time, we found modulation in expression profile, in particular increased expression of gene that encodes interleukin l‐β ( IL ‐1β). In a regression analysis, RS score was related to IL ‐1β, and the potential risk factors age, body mass index, smoking, and drinking. The levels of cytokine were positively and independently related to RS score. Our results suggest that the nearing of sporting event can trigger anger state feelings and activate immune system in rugby players. We propose the IL ‐1β as a potential biological marker of anger. However, further research is necessary to clarify the correlation between cytokine and anger. Aggr. Behav. 39 :141‐148, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Although negative parenting behavior and peer status are independently associated with childhood conduct problems (e.g., oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)), relatively little is known about their interplay, particularly in relation to differentiated measures of positive and negative peer regard. To improve the specificity of the association of negative parenting behavior and peer factors with ODD, we explored the potential interaction of parenting and peer status in a sample of 169 five‐to ten‐year‐old ethnically diverse children with and without attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) assessed using multiple measures (i.e., rating scales, interview) and informants (i.e., parents, teachers). Controlling for children's age, sex, number of ADHD symptoms, and parents' race‐ethnicity, peer acceptance inversely predicted and inconsistent discipline, harsh punishment, and peer rejection were each positively associated with ODD symptom severity. Interactive influences were also evident such that inconsistent discipline and harsh punishment each predicted elevated ODD but only among children experiencing low peer acceptance or high peer rejection. These findings suggest that supportive environments, including peer acceptance, may protect children from negative outcomes associated with inconsistent discipline and harsh punishment. Findings are integrated with theories of social support, and we additionally consider implications for intervention and prevention. Aggr. Behav. 40:79–90, 2014. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Identifying individuals who are most prone towards such revenge‐seeking is a theoretically‐informative and potentially violence‐reducing endeavor. However, we have yet to understand the extent to which revenge‐seeking individuals exhibit specific features of aggressiveness, impulsivity, and what motivates their hunt for retribution. Toward this end, we conducted three studies (total N = 673), in which revenge‐seeking was measured alongside these other constructs. Analyses repeatedly demonstrated that revenge‐seeking was associated with greater physical (but not verbal) aggressiveness, anger, and hostility. Revenge‐seeking's link to physical aggression was partially accounted for by impulses toward enjoying aggression and the tendency to use aggression to improve mood. Dominance analyses revealed that sadism explained the most variance in revenge‐seeking. Revenge‐seeking was associated with greater impulsive responses to negative and positive affect, as well as greater premeditation of behavior. These findings paint a picture of revenge‐seekers as physically aggressive curators of anger, whose retributive acts are performed with planned malice and motivated by the act's entertaining and therapeutic qualities.",

Intrusive behavior was not uncommon overall, although large differences were apparent between countries when women's personal experiences of specific intrusive activities were compared. Correlations were carried out between self-reported intrusive experiences, the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and Hofstede's dimensions of national cultures. The primary associations were between women's experiences of intrusive behavior and the level of power they are afforded within the 12 countries. Women from countries with higher GEM scores reported experiencing more intrusive activities relating to courtship and requests for sex, while the experiences of women from countries with lower GEM scores related more to monitoring and ownership. Intrusive activities, many of them constituent of harassment and stalking, would appear to be widespread and universal, and their incidence and particular form reflect national level gender inequalities.",

Sixty‐six participants were randomly assigned to receive routine intervention alone (control group) or routine intervention plus Williams LifeSkills Training (WLST group) in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was change scores on the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) from baseline to one week following end of training. Secondary outcomes were change scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale‐11 (BIS‐11) and Cook–Medley Hostility Scale (CMHS). There were significant between‐group differences in change of MOAS total score ( P &lt; .001) and all sub‐scores ( P s &lt; .01) except aggression against property. Between‐group differences were also observed in change of BIS‐11 and CMHS total score ( P s &lt; 0.05). All results favored the WLST group.

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that violent video games can increase aggression in players immediately after they play. The present research examines the effects of one subtle cue within violent video games that might moderate these effects—whether the avatar is male or female. One common stereotype is that males are more aggressive than females. Thus, playing a violent video game as a male avatar, compared to a female avatar, should be more likely to prime aggressive thoughts and inclinations in players and lead to more aggressive behavior afterwards. Male and female university students ( N = 242) were randomly assigned to play a violent video game as a male or female avatar. After gameplay, participants gave an ostensible partner who hated spicy food hot sauce to eat. The amount of hot sauce given was used to measure aggression. Consistent with priming theory, results showed that both male and female participants who played a violent game as a male avatar behaved more aggressively afterwards than those who played as female avatar. The priming effects of the male avatar were somewhat stronger for male participants than for female participants, suggesting that male participants identified more with the male avatar than did the female participants. These results are particularly noteworthy because they are consistent with another recent experiment showing that playing a violent game as an avatar with a different stereotypically aggressive attribute (black skin color) stimulates more aggression than playing as an avatar without the stereotypically aggressive attribute (Yang et al., 2014, Social Psychological and Personality Science).

    "abstract": "While most research on the development of antisocial and criminal behavior has considered nonviolent and violent crime together, some evidence points to differential risk factors for these separate types of crime. The present study explored differential risk for nonviolent and violent crime by investigating the longitudinal associations between three key child risk factors (aggression, emotion dysregulation, and social isolation) and two key adolescent risk factors (parent detachment and deviant peer affiliation) predicting violent and nonviolent crime outcomes in early adulthood. Data on 754 participants (46% African American, 50% European American, 4% other; 58% male) oversampled for aggressive-disruptive behavior were collected across three time points. Parents and teachers rated aggression, emotion dysregulation, and social isolation in fifth grade (middle childhood, age 10-11); parents and youth rated parent detachment and deviant peer affiliation in seventh and eighth grade (early adolescence, age 12-14) and arrest data were collected when participants were 22-23 years old (early adulthood). Different pathways to violent and nonviolent crime emerged. The severity of child dysfunction in late childhood, including aggression, emotion dysregulation, and social isolation, was a powerful and direct predictor of violent crime. Although child dysfunction also predicted nonviolent crime, the direct pathway accounted for half as much variance as the direct pathway to violent crime. Significant indirect pathways through adolescent socialization experiences (peer deviancy) emerged for nonviolent crime, but not for violent crime, suggesting adolescent socialization plays a more distinctive role in predicting nonviolent than violent crime. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "It has been stated that Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) increases the likelihood of risky behavior such as intimate partner violence (IPV), but the cognitive mechanisms that facilitate or underlie these types of behavior remain unexplained. In this regard, several authors have established that impulsivity and inattentive symptoms might affect basic processes such as emotional decoding and set‐shifting abilities, which are important processes for emotional and behavioral regulation. Hence, these symptoms entail a reduction in sensitivity to key contextual stimuli. Accordingly, the main aim of this study was to examine the involvement of impulsivity (assessed by self‐reports) and attention switching impairments (assessed with the Attention Switching Task; AST), as well as the associations between these cognitive processes in facial emotion decoding (assessed by the eyes test) and cognitive flexibility impairments (measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST) in a sample of IPV perpetrators ( n = 89; mean age = 40) and a control group matched on socio‐demographic characteristics ( n = 39; mean age = 41). IPV perpetrators had higher trait impulsivity and greater attention switching costs than controls. Moreover, differences were also found between groups in facial expression decoding and WCST performance, with IPV perpetrators showing lower Eyes Test and WCST scores. Mainly, we observed that the ability to recognize facial expressions was poorer when individuals showed high impulsivity in both groups, but this association was only explained by deficits in attention switching in IPV perpetrators. Our research reinforces the importance of impulsivity and inattentive symptoms as targets for specific cognitive rehabilitation interventions designed to prevent the long‐term IPV risk of recidivism.",

Recent theoretical and empirical work has strongly suggested that the combination of anger, contempt, and disgust (ANCODI) comprise the basic elements of hatred, and are the key emotions associated with intergroup aggression. No study, however, has provided evidence that these emotions cause hostile cognitions about specific groups. We report two studies that provide initial evidence. In both, participants were members of ideologically motivated groups and were primed with ANCODI. In Study 1 participants primed with ANCODI produced more aggressive cognitions relative to their opponent outgroup than a neutral outgroup; this effect did not occur for participants primed with fear‐sadness. In Study 2 participants primed with ANCODI engaged in more competitive decision making against their opponent outgroups than a neutral outgroup; this effect did not occur for participants primed with disgust only. These findings contribute to the literature on the role of emotion in intergroup aggression and hostility, and provide a more nuanced view of the role of emotions in intergroup relations, possibly identifying the basic emotional elements of hatred.

The aim of the present study was to explore whether children's responses to bullying vary depending on the gender of the bully and victim and the type of bullying portrayed. In total, 437 children aged 9-11 years from four primary schools in the UK took part in the study. Each child read a story about one child bullying another. There were 12 different versions of the story, varying the type of bullying (verbal, physical, or relational/indirect) and the gender of the bully and victim (i.e., male bully-female victim, female bully-male victim, male bully-male victim, female bully-female victim). Each child was randomly allocated to one of the 12 stories. After reading the story the children then responded to a series of questions to assess their perceptions of the victim and bully and situation. Overall females liked the bully more than males; females also reported liking the female victim more than the male victim and females were more likely than males to intervene with a female victim. The bullying was viewed as more serious, more sympathy was shown to the victim, and there was a greater likelihood of intervention when the incident involved a female bully. There was less liking for the bully if the situation involved a female victim of physical bullying. The findings are explained in terms of social identity theory and social norms about typical male and female behavior.",

One attribute that may contribute to both IPV and poor parenting is hostility. Moreover, the link between hostility and these outcomes may be mediated by substance use, such that more hostile individuals are at greater risk for using drugs and alcohol, leading them to engage in more aggressive and rejecting behavior toward their partners and children. We tested this possibility in sample of 132 fathers. Additionally, we explored whether hostility and substance use had interactive effects on IPV and parenting by examining moderated-mediation models. The results show that substance use mediated the relationship between hostility and all IPV and parenting outcomes. Furthermore, this mediated relationship was moderated by substance use level for parenting outcomes, but not IPV. In the case of parenting, the mediated path from hostility to aggressive and rejecting parenting only occurred for those high in substance use. Limitations and implications for prevention and treatment of IPV and aggressive and rejecting parenting are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 41:205-213, 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In the present study ( N = 153), the dual‐hormone hypothesis was empirically tested in the context of an economic game that included a decision whether to dominate another individual. We also examined whether the dual‐hormone interaction is more likely to be found in individuals who are chronically prone to dominance tendencies. Results revealed a significant testosterone × cortisol interaction in line with the dual‐hormone hypothesis. Additionally, the testosterone × cortisol interaction was only significant in individuals with a high level of chronic dominance.

Understanding both the prevalence of IPV during pregnancy and its potential impact on the health of pregnant women is important for the development and implementation of interventions to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between maternal experiences of IPV during pregnancy and pregnancy complications. A health‐facility‐based cross‐sectional study was conducted from July 2015 to April 2016 among 400 randomly selected women who were admitted to the postnatal wards of Rajshahi Medical College Hospital for delivery. Data were collected through face‐to‐face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to assess relationships between variables of interest after controlling for potential confounders. Results indicated that 39.0% of women reported physical IPV and 26.3% of women reported sexual IPV during pregnancy. Additionally, 69.5% of women experienced medical complications (MCs); of this group, 44.3% experienced obstetric complications (OCs) and 79.3% experienced any pregnancy complication (AC) during their last pregnancy. The experience of physical IPV during pregnancy was significantly associated with the experience of MCs (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15–4.01), OCs (AOR: 4.23, 95% CI: 2.01–7.12) and AC (AOR: 5.26, 95% CI: 2.98–10.52). Women who experienced sexual IPV during pregnancy were also at increased risk of suffering from any MC, any OC, and AC. Maternal experience of IPV during pregnancy is positively associated with pregnancy complications. Preventing IPV directed at pregnant women might reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the current study was to examine the link between children's psychophysiology and aggression when both constructs were assessed simultaneously in scenarios designed to provide the opportunity to aggress for either a reactive reason or a proactive reason. Both sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity (skin conductance) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia or RSA), as well as their interaction, were included as physiological measures. Participants were 35 5th‐grade children who were placed in two virtual‐peer scenarios; one scenario provided the opportunity to aggress in response to peer provocation (i.e., reactive aggression) and the other scenario provided the opportunity to aggress for instrumental gain (i.e., proactive aggression). Both skin conductance and RSA were assessed at the time that children were given the opportunity to aggress; this simultaneous assessment of psychophysiology and aggression allowed for an examination of in‐the‐moment relations between the two constructs. For the reactive scenario, RSA moderated the in‐the‐moment relation between skin conductance and aggression such that the association was positive at low RSA but negative at high RSA. For the proactive scenario, skin conductance negatively predicted aggression in‐the‐moment, and RSA positively predicted aggression in‐the‐moment, but their interaction was not a significant predictor of aggression. Theoretical implications for reactive and proactive aggression and underlying physiological processes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Psychological research suggests that violent extremism (e.g., terrorism) stems partly from existential motives, such as individuals’ need to achieve significance in life after experiencing failure, ostracism, or humiliation (Significance Quest Theory; SQT). Parallel investigations from sociology and criminology established similar findings by linking anomia—a syndrome including feelings of meaninglessness, powerlessness, isolation, self‐estrangement, and normlessness—with violent behavior. In line with SQT, this contribution tested if anomia could mediate Loss of Significance effects on violent extremism. Accordingly, three studies conducted in France highlight indirect effects of exposure to discrimination on legitimation of political violence (Study 1, cross‐sectional, minority population sample, N = 110), violent behavioral intentions (Study 2, experimental, undergraduate sample, N = 249), and support for ISIS fighters (Study 3, experimental, undergraduate sample, N = 221) through anomia. A subsequent study shows this indirect effect to be robust when controlled for Social Dominance Orientation and Political Extremism (Study 4, cross‐sectional, undergraduate sample, N = 279). A final investigation re‐analyzing data collected in Turkey highlights a reverse effect when the independent variable tapped into social inclusion (rather than exclusion; Study 5, cross‐sectional, undergraduate sample, N = 321). This indirect effect was also robust to Political Extremism and Intolerance as control variables. These results support the usefulness of considering anomia as a proximal predictor of violent extremism in a SQT perspective.",

Such an examination could help understand the influential factors of aggression from the perspective of multiple motivations affecting the development of aggressive motivations over time. The present study argued that angry rumination would be a common influential factor for both reactive and proactive aggression. In addition, consideration of future consequences (CFC) may moderate the longitudinal effect of angry rumination on proactive aggression. Two studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. In Study 1, a cross‐lagged analysis with a 6‐month interval was employed. A total of 505 undergraduate students (46% males) completed the questionnaires twice. Results indicated that after a 6‐month period, angry rumination predicted reactive aggression but not proactive aggression. Furthermore, reactive aggression predicted angry rumination over time. In Study 2, a moderation analysis was performed with another 437 participants (130 males). The results partly supported our hypotheses, indicating that CFC‐immediate (CFC‐I) moderated the longitudinal effect of angry rumination on proactive aggression. The present results extended prior research regarding the predictors of proactive and reactive aggression and may contribute to a greater understanding of the development of aggressive motivation. In addition, our research suggested that high CFC‐I may be an important factor for the motivation change from reactive aggression to proactive aggression.",

Facet 2 (affective) showed the strongest effect size (Cohen's d = 0.53; Percentage change in odds = 22.6%) in predicting violent recidivism. Analyses of the four items constituting the affective facet indicated that callous/lack of empathy (Percentage change in odds = 134.4%) and failure to accept responsibility (Percentage change in odds = 94.5%) were the strongest predictors of violent recidivism. Findings are to our knowledge the first to document the utility of the PCL-R in distinguishing violent from nonviolent recidivism and highlight the role of affective impairment (particularly lack of empathy) in violent recidivism.",

Much research has shown the BGCM to be the only published theory that differentiates traditional and cyberbullying while validly predicting cyberbullying. So far, however, the cross‐cultural ubiquity has gone understudied. Thus, 1,592 adult participants across seven countries (USA, Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, and Singapore) completed measures germane to the BGCM. Supporting the BGCM, the variables were significantly correlated for the entire sample, participants from independent cultures, and participants from interdependent cultures. However, the relationship between BIMOB and positive cyberbullying attitudes as well as the relationship between positive cyberbullying attitudes and cyberbullying perpetration were stronger for independent cultures. These results suggest that the BGCM postulates are mostly universal, but several relations appear to be culturally different. Theoretical implications are discussed.",

In Study 1, we randomly assigned 215 (108 female) college‐aged participants to a strong or weak provocation by having a research assistant talk to the participant about failing a task in a harsh or confused tone. This was followed by a second research assistant giving a strong or weak excuse to the participant regarding the first research assistant's behavior. Then, aggressive behavior was assessed using a researcher rating task. In Study 2, 63 (25 female) college‐aged participants interacted with a confederate on the CRT. All participants were strongly provoked by receiving strong noise blasts. After five CRT trials, the confederate delivered weak or strong mitigating information to the participant regarding the noises blasts. The results indicated that: (i) strong provocations are more likely to increase aggression than weak provocations; (ii) strong mitigating information is more likely to decrease aggression than weak mitigating information; and (iii) the varying strength of mitigating information is important in situations involving weak, but not strong provocations: strong mitigating information is more likely than weak mitigating information reduce aggression when provocation is strong, but not when provocation is weak. We discuss the importance of mitigating information in decreasing aggressive behavior and the conditions in which mitigating information is especially likely to be effective. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Prior research indicates that student aggression against teachers is widespread, and it has negative impacts on victimized teachers’ emotional and physical well‐being and job performance. However, little is known about the relationship between the recency and duration of victimization and teachers’ thoughts about quitting the teaching profession and related job dissatisfaction and disconnectedness to school. Analyses of data from a longitudinal study of 1,236 US teachers fills these gaps. The study found that many teachers experienced theft/vandalism and sexual harassment victimization that was limited to just 1 year. In contrast, sizeable proportions of teachers experienced verbal abuse and nonphysical contact aggression that occurred over 2 years. Multiple regression analyses showed that teachers who reported recent or multiyear victimization had lower levels of connectedness to school, less job satisfaction, and more thoughts about ending their teaching careers. These results may indicate that unless victimization recurs, negative effects of victimization are contemporaneous and are less likely to persist. Additional research is needed to examine victimization over longer than 2 years, investigate the effects of the frequency of different types of aggression against teachers, and identify school policies and interventions that weaken the connection of victimization to negative outcomes.",

Although the mechanisms underlying such link have not been completely clarified, it has been suggested that problematic use of social media and online videogames (i.e., two common forms of PUI among young adults) lead to increased sleep disturbances which, in turn, represent a relevant trigger for aggression. We have tested this hypothesis in a sample ( N = 480) of young individuals (351 females and 129 males; mean age: 21.76 ± 1.92 years; range: 18–24). Self‐report measures investigating symptoms related to social media addiction (SMA), Internet gaming disorder (IGD), insomnia severity, and aggression were used. Mediational models analyzing the direct and indirect associations of SMA‐ and IGD‐related symptoms on aggression severity through insomnia‐related symptoms were performed controlling for confounding factors. The models showed that the total effects of SMA‐related symptoms ( B = 0.018; p = .010) and of IGD‐related symptoms ( B = 0.018; p = .041) on aggression severity were significant and that these associations were mediated by insomnia‐related symptoms (respectively, p &lt; .001 and p = .003). Our findings support the potential mediating role of insomnia severity in the association of SMA‐ and IGD‐related disturbances with levels of aggression.",

Recent studies suggest that rates of unacknowledged rape may be as high or even higher among men than among women. This study examined rates of unacknowledged female and male victims of rape and sexual assault by comparing responses to behaviorally specific items of the Sexual Aggression and Victimization Scale (SAV‐S) with responses to broad questions using the labels of sexual assault and rape (SARA) in 593 participants (303 women) in Germany. As predicted, more women and men were classified as rape victims based on behaviorally specific items than on the basis of the broad rape item. The rates of unacknowledged rape were about 60% for women and 75% for men. The gender difference was not significant. Against our prediction, no significant differences in acknowledgement of sexual assault were found in relation to coercive strategy and victim–perpetrator relationship. Few cases of rape and sexual assault identified by the SARA items were missed by the behaviorally specific questions. The implications for establishing prevalence rates of rape and sexual assault and for comparing victims and nonvictims in terms of vulnerability factors and outcomes of sexual victimization are discussed.",

It is widely acknowledged that adolescents' violence exposure contributes to later perpetration of aggressive behaviors. However, few studies have compared the effects of violence exposure on reactive/proactive aggression based on the forms (i.e., witnessing and being victimized) and the contexts (i.e., family, community, and school), especially in preadolescents. Thus, the relationship between two forms of violence exposure (witnessing and victimization) and later perpetrating reactive and proactive aggression were compared within and across three social contexts in a sample of Chinese preadolescents. Participants were 609 preadolescents 51.9% boys) recruited from five primary schools in China. Information on two forms of violence exposure across multiple contexts and demography were collected at Time 1 ( M age = 10.65), and aggression data (i.e., reactive and proactive aggression) were collected a year later at Time 2. Results evidenced witnessing and being victimized by violence in the home were more consistently related to later perpetration of reactive and proactive aggression. Witnessing family violence was significantly associated with later perpetration of reactive aggression than witnessing violence in the community. Being victimized by violence in the community and the home were significantly associated with later perpetration of proactive aggression than school victimization. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the roles of both types of violence exposure across contexts in later perpetration of aggression during early adolescence.",

We presented infants with a simple interaction involving two agents: one of them (the “repulser”) moved toward and pushed the other (the “approacher”) which reacted by simply moving toward the repulser without contacting it. We found that 8‐month‐olds ( N = 28) looked longer at the approacher than at the repulser (Experiment 1), whereas 4‐month‐olds ( N = 30) exhibited no preference (Experiment 2). To control for low‐level cues (such as the preference for the agent that moved after the contact), two new groups of 4‐ and 8‐month‐old infants were presented with a series of interactions in which the agents inverted their social roles. Older infants ( N = 30) manifested no preference for either agent (Experiment 3), while younger infants ( N = 30) looked longer at the first agent to move (Experiment 4). Our results indicated that 8‐month‐olds’ preferences for the approacher over the repulser depended on social information and were finely tuned to agents that display prosocial rather than antisocial behavior. We discuss these findings in light of the development and adaptive value of the ability to negatively evaluate repulsers, to avoid choosing them as partners.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this special issue of Aggressive Behavior is to present various topics and perspectives on the anthropology of aggression and conflict. First, a brief introduction to the articles in this issue is provided. Second, anthropological findings on sex differences in aggression are considered. The cross-cultural pattern is for males to engage in more frequent and more severe physical aggression than females. These observed sex differences are in accordance with the evolutionary concepts of sexual selection and parental investment. Simultaneously, it is clear that a host of proximate cultural influences also affects levels and styles of aggression in both females and males. Anthropological findings related to the indirect aggression concept also are discussed and tentatively related to gender. In the third section of this article, the nature and ramifications of the tremendous cross-cultural variation in aggression are explored. It is clear that nonviolent cultures exist, as do a range of more violent ones. It is also clear, as illustrated in several examples, that aggressive cultures can become dramatically more peaceful, and vice versa. Aggression can be viewed within the broader frame of conflict management; most cultures, in fact, use a variety of mechanisms for dealing with conflict that do not involve aggression. In addition, consideration is given to intracultural variability in aggression, the multidimensionality of aggression, cultural meaning (beliefs) and aggression, and the controversy over actor-based (emic) vs. Observer-based (etic) interpretations of aggression.

We studied whether worker size and size difference between opponents had an effect on aggression during conspecific encounters. Although the capacity to recognize nestmates was shared by all individuals, some patterns of agonistic behaviors were size related. Escape was mostly displayed by the small workers, and threat, associated with ritualized fights, by the large workers. As game theory predicted, ants of C. niger adjusted their level of aggression as a function of the size of the opponent. However, only large individuals used such assessment strategies, responding with escalation of aggression towards small workers and reduction of aggression towards large ones. On the contrary, small individuals behaved in the same manner whatever the opponent's size. Differences between both morphological castes were discussed with reference to the resource holding assessment models. Aggr. Behav. 25:369–379, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Swiss-Webster mice living in a visible burrow system (VBS) reacted to presentation of a live cat in the surface area of the VBS by retreat to the burrows and reductions in nondefensive behaviors such as eating and drinking. Live eat-exposed subjects remained in the burrows 14 hr or more, while subjects exposed to a toy (plush) cat prior to live cat exposure reemerged almost immediately and made many contacts with the toy cat. However, subjects exposed first to the cat and later to a toy cat showed intermediate surface reemergence times and cat contacts during toy cat tests, indicating strong sensitization effects of prior live cat exposure. Previous studies indicated that rats in this situation show retreat to the burrows, surface avoidance, and reduction in nondefensive behaviors. The mouse pattern was similar, with the notable exception that in the first 5min block after cat presentation, mice rapidly alternated retreat to the burrow chambers with reappearance in the tunnel segment near the surface, to scan the surface visually and sniff. Movement during this time block involved a stretch attend posture characteristic also of risk assessment activities in rats. Such visual and olfactory inspection of the cat is not seen in rats in the VBS. This difference may be related to the finding that rats, but not mice, emit ultrasonic \"alarm cries\" during and after cat exposure. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone levels were examined in prisoners convicted of violent crimes (n = 13), in men previously convicted of violent crimes but currently not in prison (n = 15), in nonviolent alcoholics (n = 15), and in randomly selected control males (n = 16). Morning, afternoon, and evening testosterone levels were assessed after a minimum alcohol abstinence period of 24 hr. Violent and nonviolent men did not differ in plasma total testosterone level on any sampling occasion. In violent men, however, testosterone levels were significantly correlated with hostility, as measured by the Derogatis Symptom Check List. Most violent men were diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASP) [DSM-III-R; 301.70], and the unweighted ASP symptom count also correlated significantly with testosterone levels in these subjects. We suggest that individuals whose life histories involve numerous antisocial behaviors tend to have high testosterone levels even when interpersonal violence is excluded. This, however, does not eliminate the possibility that males who are characterized by high hostility may also have elevated testosterone levels. Violent predisposition and antisocial conduct beginning in early adolescence predict adult aggressive behaviors, which are augmented by power-related alcohol expectancies and alcohol abuse. Aggr.

    "abstract": "This study describes the use of a \"cooperative\" computer game in which the subject has to follow directions, supposedly sent from a partner, and steer a tank to avoid invisible mines. The tank is lost if it hits a mine or does not reach base within a set time limit. The game was designed so that the majority of trials would be lost. Affective (mood self-ratings), cognitive (attribution of blame questionnaire), and behavioural (feedback sent to the \"partner\") outcomes were assessed. The game significantly increased ratings of discontentedness and anger. Self-blame for task failure was correlated with the Guilt subscale of the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI), and blaming the partner was correlated positively with the Motor Aggression subscale and negatively with the empathy scale of the I7, supporting the notion of hostile attributional bias in adults. The importance of individual differences in the strength of the behavioural inhibition system (BIS) and behavioural activation system (BAS) were explored using the BIS/BAS scales developed by Carver and White [1994]. Sending negative feedback to the partner was negatively correlated with scores on the BIS. Scores on BAS drive were positively correlated with increases in discontentedness and with sending negative feedback on trials when the tank was lost due to lack of time. These results are discussed in relation to Berkowitz's [1993] model of affective aggression. Aggr. Behav. 24:27–36, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The sensory contact technique increases aggressiveness in male mice and allows aggressive types of behavior to be formed as a result of the repeated experience of victories in daily agonistic confrontations. Some behavioral domains confirm the development of learned aggression in males similar to those in humans. The features are repeated experience of aggression reinforced by victories; elements of learned behavior after periods of confrontation; intent, measured by increase of the aggressive motivation prior to agonistic confrontation; and decreased emotionality, estimated by parameters of open-field behavior. Relevant situation provokes increases in aggression (boundary aggression). This review summarizes data on the influence of positive fighting experience in daily intermale confrontations on the behavior, neurochemistry, and physiology of aggressive mice (winners). This sort of experience changes many characteristics in individual and social behaviors, these having been estimated in different tests and in varied situations. Some physiological parameters are also changed in the winners. Neurochemical data confirm the activation of brain dopaminergic systems and functional inhibition of serotonergic system in winners under the influence of the repeated experience of aggression. The expression of the neurochemical and behavioral changes observed in winners has been found to depend on the mouse strain and on the duration of their agonistic confrontations. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Even though injury and death are more common consequences of fighting among animals than once believed, they are still relatively infrequent. Modern evolutionary models of animal combat have emphasized that given the threat of retaliation, animals only escalate to more injurious fighting if the benefits outweigh the costs, and then only if threat and bluff fail to achieve the goal. Such models stress the role of communication as to whether animals decide to escalate or not. An alternative view is that failure to produce injury or death arises from the neutralization of one animal's attack by another's defense. That is, attack and defense end in a stalemate that may be misinterpreted by outside observers as an absence of injury producing behavior. As attack typically involves the biting or striking of specific body targets, movements and postures occurring during combat need to be analyzed with respect to their role in gaining or averting such contact. For example, in the combat of muroid rodents the attacker targets the lower dorsum and flanks (low threshold) or face (high threshold), whereas a defender may defensively launch counterstrikes against the attacker's face. Two combat tactics (supine defense and lateral attack) typically present in the fighting of muroid rodents are analyzed in detail to illustrate how targets constrain the movements of combatants. Such a functional analysis of combat assumes that the movements and postures performed are related to their role in the attack and defense of targets. Deviations from such a strict functional interpretation reveal some of the other factors that may constrain the combatants' behavior. For example, body morphology and the aggressiveness of the opponent are shown to be important in deciding the type of combat tactic to use and how it is performed. Finally, movements and postures that are neutral or even counterproductive for attack and defense may be revealed as communicatory. This approach provides a means of analyzing behavior during the \"heat of combat\" that is typically not dealt with in traditional evolutionary models. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Aggression among female rats is almost entirely confined to the period of late pregnancy and lactation. Behaviorally it is similar to the aggression of males including piloerection and lateral attacks, but it differs in its function. Unlike male aggression which serves to establish a social hierarchy and a territory, i. e., is competitive, maternal aggression is protective, i. e., it serves to prevent predation of the mother's offspring. In this respect it is closely related temporally and causally to maternal care; if the offspring are removed maternal aggression wanes almost immediately–its function no longer exists! Studies on aggression by mothers, among rats, from the author's laboratory are reviewed and comparisons made with maternal care. As noted, maternal aggression and maternal care are closely related during the cycle of maternal behavior and they share a similar hormonal basis and possibly the effect of uterine stimulation, but maternal care requires prolactin and the decline of progesterone while maternal aggression appears independent of pituitary hormones and does not require a decline in progesterone. Maternal aggression like maternal care appears to be organized into a hormonal phase, during pregnancy, parturition, and for about a week postpartum and a nonhormonal phase thereafter. Bilateral radiofrequency lesions of the lateral midbrain peripeduncular nucleus (PPN) produce deficits in maternal aggression if made on lactation day 7 (L7), but not earlier, without producing significant deficits in maternal behavior. Experiments showed that the PPN does not mediate hormonally stimulated maternal aggression; it appears to mediate only nonhormonally stimulated maternal aggression. Studies on the role of pregnancy hormones on long-term retention of maternal aggression and the role of olfaction in maternal aggression are also reviewed. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Using a longitudinal design, prior experience with violence as a victim and opportunity to aggress were examined as predictors of college women's verbal and physical aggression toward romantic partners. Five additional categories of predictors identified in previous research (experienced and witnessed parental aggression during childhood, attitudes accepting of aggression, aggressive/impulsive personality attributes, psychopathology, and prior use of aggression) were also examined. Blockwise hierarchical regression analyses were performed to reveal the best predictors of verbal and physical aggression during the first year of college. Significant predictors of verbal aggression were prior use of verbal aggression in heterosexual conflicts during adolescence, witnessed parental aggression, level of adolescent sexual victimization, being a target of rational conflict strategies during adolescence, and use of physical aggression in romantic adolescent relationships, as well as self-reported verbal aggression as an index of personality, weak emotional ties, number of sexual partners, and approval of sexual intimacy in many types of relationships. Significant predictors of physical aggression were prior use of physical aggression during adolescence, witnessing and experiencing parental aggression, being a victim of physical aggression in adolescent romantic relationships, weak emotional ties, low levels of alcohol/drug use, and opportunity to aggress. A developmental model of aggression in which childhood experiences with family violence contribute to the likelihood of subsequent involvement in relationship violence seems appropriate. Past experience with aggression may be particularly important for women. Cultural expectations about women's roles do not provide the social support for female aggression that is provided for male aggression. Adolescent sexual victimizations and general involvement in conflictual relationships (as target and perpetrator) predicted subsequent verbal aggression, whereas experiencing family violence and sustaining physical aggression in romantic relationships predicted subsequent physical aggression. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Adult men and women endorse different sets of thoughts, beliefs and emotions (\"social representations\") about their aggression. Study I investigated whether this was also the case for children. A modified version of a questionnaire designed by Campbell et al. [(1992) Aggressive Behavior 18:95–108] for adults was administered to 8–11 year olds to determine whether they viewed their own aggressive acts in terms of instrumental (male) or expressive (female) representations, as had been found for adults. This was found to be the case, but there were no age differences and no interaction of sex and age. The modified questionnaire showed similar internal consistency to the original, and the effect size for sex was similar to that found for adults. It was noted that the questionnaire is biased to ward physical aggression and hence toward an activity compatible with the masculine role. In study 2, the questionnaire was reworded to refer to indirect aggression (which is more characteristic of girls) and presented to substantially the same sample. Again, girls showed higher expressive scores than boys, although the sex difference was diminished. This supported the view that there is a general sex difference in reactions to aggressive or hostile acts, independent of their form. However, analysis of individual questionnaire items showed that it was lack of emotional control and subsequent regrets about the act that most clearly distinguished the sexes. It is argued that these differences arise from more general gender role characteristics rather than being specific to aggression. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sex recognition is based on color signals in many species of lizards. However, olfactory stimuli are also clearly involved, and many species might rely primarily on chemoreception. We aimed to examine whether color pattern or odors, or a combination of both factors, induce the aggressive response of males of the lizard P. hispanicus . We experimentally manipulated the coloration and odor of male P. hispanicus , thereby creating groups with all combinations between coloration and odor of males or females. Using data from staged encounters, we compared the responses of resident males to the experimental groups of manipulated males and their response to unmanipulated individuals (males and females). Responding males reacted significantly more aggressively to intruders with male odors independent of their coloration, whereas intruders with female odors did not elicit aggressive responses but were preferentially courted, irrespective of their actual sex and body coloration. In addition, intruders with female odors elicited a higher number of tongue‐flick explorations than male odor ones. Comparisons with unmanipulated male and female intruders agreed with these expectations. Therefore, at least at close range, odoriferous cues seem to be more important than color patterns in sex recognition and intrasexual aggression by male P. hispanicus . We suggest that this might be a pattern commoner than expected in many species of reptiles.Aggr. Behav. 28:154–163, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Using an ethological observation method (the PC-MC comparison method), this study investigated patterns of reconciliation after aggression among Japanese preschool children, focusing on factors that influenced its occurrence or acceptance, as well as on strategies and function. There were several factors among four-year-olds that facilitated reconciliatory attempts and acceptance, such as proximity after the aggression; among three-year-olds there were no such factors. Depending on the situation during and after aggression, children used 'explicit' (e.g., apologizing, compromising, and offering objects) and 'implicit' (e.g., being friendly, talking without apologizing, and touching the opponent gently) reconciliatory strategies. Reconciliation occurred more often among friends than among non-friends, particularly among four-year-olds. However, after considering the baseline affiliation level, the conciliatory tendency among non-friends was higher than that among friends in four-year-olds. Victims' self-directed behavior (SDB) - a behavioral index of stress - was elevated following aggression, but decreased following reconciliation. This suggests that reconciliation functions to reduce the post-conflict stress suffered by the targets of aggression. Aggress. Behav. 31:000–000, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Aggression was mostly approved of among OTs and the least among COs, the women scoring in the middle somewhat closer to OTs. Differences in choice of sex role identity emerged, so that OTs often chose a masculine sex role, while for COs, the choice of an androgynous role was the most frequent one. Women chose feminine and androgynous roles with equal frequency. Moral approval of aggression could not be explained on the basis of sex role identification.

Peer social status refers to the degree to which a child is accepted by his or her peer group. By asking children to nominate peers they “like most” and “like least,” one can identify children who are popular, rejected, neglected, or viewed as average within their peer group. Results indicated low to moderate correlations between peer-nominated aggression and global indices of social acceptance. More specifically, it was found that aggressive children largely comprised the rejected and average social status groups, but not the popular or neglected groups. Furthermore, analyses indicated that according to both peers and teachers, aggressive/rejected children showed academic and social-skill deficits, whereas aggressive children of average peer status exhibited adequate adjustment similar to that of nonaggressive/average-status children. These results suggest the importance of considering peer social status when identifying aggressive children in need of intervention and in determining which skill deficits to address. In addition, knowledge of an aggressive child's peer status might be useful in enhancing the predictability of adult adjustment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Fighting between males is a frequent component of the rutting behavior of Cervidae. Frequent conflicts are exhausting; fighting may be risky and can lead to serious injuries or even death. We focused on the process of assessment of the opponent's fighting ability and escalation of the combat, estimating the probability of fighting based on the encounter components such as groaning and parallel walk. In this study, we observed the agonistic behavior of fallow deer bucks ( Dama dama ) during the rut over four seasons. During this time, we recorded 205 encounters between bucks. Non‐contact display, which allows contestants to assess their opponents fighting ability, occurred in 83% of the encounters. The highest predicted probability of a fight was found when both of the males vocalized and turned into the parallel walk. The chance of a clear outcome decreased when the males were fighting in comparison to when they did not fight. The initiator of the competitive encounter won 41% of the cases, while the attacked buck won 23% of the encounters. If the contestants avoided fighting, however, the initiator won 78% of encounters. Therefore, the initiator was more successful when no fight occurred compared to when the encounters escalated into fighting. In most cases where ritualized behavior occurred, one of the opponents left after vocalization or parallel walk occurred. Thus, vocalization and parallel walk increased the probability for a clear outcome. The probability of a fight was lowest in situations where the males displayed asymmetric behavior. Increased symmetry of the contestants' behavior was strongly correlated with a higher probability of a fight. Thus, these results indicate that fallow deer bucks use efficient tactic during the rut, which, in turn, minimizes the chance of injury while fighting during the breeding season. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Two studies were conducted using the Buss aggression machine paradigm to investigate the mediational role of physical exercise with respect to subsequent aggression in relation to the presence or absence of previous instigation. The irritability level of subjects was taken into account in the first study, and the subject' emotional susceptibility level in the second study. In both studies sex differences were also considered so that each study resulted in a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 design with ten subjects in each cell. As far as irritability is concerned, experimental subjects (pedaling on a bicycle ergonometer) delivered higher shocks than controls (who just waited out the 10 min the experimental subjects were pedaling), independent of irritability level or of the presence or absence of previous instigation. When emotional susceptibility was taken into consideration, physical exercise associated with high level of emotional susceptibility and previous instigation resulted in increased intensity of the shocks subsequently delivered. These findings are discussed in terms of the importance of stable personality characteristics that may differentially mediate aggression.",

A combination of behavioral and endocrine parameters, rather than single measures, was used to assign each individual its social rank within each group. Tables of concordance between behavioral and endocrine parameters were compiled to evaluate the dominance and the subordination hierarchy. Different behavioral categories and elements characterized dominance and subordination, indicating the two as district rather than simply reciprocal traits. Their endocrine basis is also different, final levels of testosterone and estradiol being associated with dominance, and corticosterone, ACTH, and androstenedione with subordination. The same hormones in the initial samples were unrelated to the subsequent social status, indicating that hormones are not prerequisites of status. The relevance of specific behavioral and endocrine parameters is discussed.",

From an anthropological perspective, these devices should be patterned in any culture and somewhat variable across cultures. I refer to the operation of these mechanisms as hostility management. I describe and analyze a number of these hostility management mechanisms which I have observed to operate in the control of interpersonal aggression over a number of years in a Zapotec community in Mexico. The attitudes and values of people in the community are not demonstrably antiaggressive. On the other hand, aggressivity does not meet with approbation in the value system either. There are values in the system, most notably those stressing cooperation, responsibility, and respect which although they are not explicitly anti-aggressive, nevertheless, function generally to preclude high levels of interpersonal aggression. Formal social control mechanisms, in and of themselves, are largely ineffective in controlling aggression and for effectiveness are largely dependent on less formal mechanisms of control. The effectiveness of the less formal control control devices appear to rest in the observed fact that they function primarily in hostility management preventing covert hostile dispositions from empting into overtly aggressive behaviors. The descriptions and analyses of these hostility management mechanisms evident in the Zapotec community appear to have counterparts in other Zapotec and non-Zapotec communities in mesoamerica. Evidence for them exists in a number of unrelated fragments to be found in the accounts of anthropologists, most of whom have had no focal interest in the study of aggression control.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the present experiments was to clarify sex differences in socio‐developmental factors that affected defense behavior in rats. Sex differences in the defensive burying behavior of rats, and related social factors, were explored in three developmental stages: juvenile, puberty, and adult; 30, 50, and 80 days of age, respectively. The duration of burying, digging into bedding material, stretch‐attend postures, and crouch/freezing were measured in a shock‐prod test. For males, the duration of burying was longer in the juvenile and pubertal stages than in adulthood. For females, no age differences in the duration of burying were found. Males showed longer burying durations than females in both the juvenile and pubertal stages. For both sexes, the highest duration of digging was found in the juvenile stage, and females showed longer durations of digging than males. Both male and female rats isolated during the juvenile stage, from 26 to 40 days of age, showed smaller durations of burying behavior compared to pair‐reared rats. This effect of juvenile isolation was maintained among both adult males and females even when they were returned to pair rearing after isolation. Isolation during adulthood, from 66 to 80 days of age, increased burying behavior in males, but decreased it in females. The durations of digging, stretch‐attend postures, and crouch/freezing were not affected by isolation. The decrease in defensive burying and its increase resulting from isolation in adult male rats, suggest that the emergence of adult‐like social relationships in males suppressed the duration of burying. Male and female rats isolated during the juvenile stage maintained lower levels of burying, suggesting that social experience as juveniles is important for the emergence of defensive burying behavior.

It has two core aims, first to explore the nature of bullying in relation to indirect and direct aggression and, second, to explore the predictors of bully‐category membership with particular reference to behavioral characteristics. Participants were adult men ( n =728) and women ( n =525) prisoners. All completed a behavioral measure of behavior indicative of bullying (Direct and Indirect Prisoner behavior Checklist, DIPC) that also explored prison‐based behavior such as negative acts towards staff or prison rules, positive acts and drug‐related behavior. Indirect aggression was, as predicted, reported more frequently than direct aggression, although this only held for perpetration. Bully‐victims, as predicted, showed more negative behavior. Pure bullies and pure victims also showed more negative behavior than the other categories. The findings are discussed in relation to the environment in which bullying behavior is being assessed and with attention to the possible motivations underlying both bullying and negative behavior.

    "abstract": "Abstract The study provided a preliminary test of the intergenerational continuity of maternal psychopathic features in a non‐referred elementary aged sample of children. Consistent with dominant etiological models and recent behavioral genetics research, a direct association was expected between maternal and child affective features of psychopathy (i.e., callous–unemotional or CU traits). Potential mediators representative of alternative transmission mechanisms were assessed including parenting dysfunction, parental hostility/interpersonal insensitivity, and child impulsivity. Behavioral features of psychopathy were also assessed and were predicted to bear weaker and more indirect parent–child associations. A mixed sex sample of 83 children accompanied by a biological mother were administered a multi‐informant rating‐scale battery including separate parent (i.e., Levenson Self‐Report Psychopathy Scale) and child (i.e., Antisocial Process Screening Device) measures of psychopathy. Consistent with prediction, a significant association was documented between maternal and child CU traits ( r =.22). Additionally, a slightly weaker association and statistical trend ( r =.21) was observed in the relation between maternal and child interpersonal features of the psychopathy construct. Contrary to prediction, all documented associations were fully mediated by parental hostility and parenting dysfunction. Given the preliminary nature of study findings, implications for developmental modeling and future intergenerational continuity research are discussed. Aggr.

It is also suggested that the reduction in aggression with quipazine was related to quipazine's preferential binding to the 5-HT-1 receptor. The 5-HT-2 receptor antagonist mianserin reduced aggression suggesting that 5-HT-2 receptor blockade is inhibitory for aggression.

Statistical significance in frequencies of displacement differs between but not within these layered groups of females. Factors such as group composition, presence of uterine kin, reproductive state, and individual personality are hypothesized to predict changes in female rank far better than does reproductive value.

Participants' emotional responses were measured via self‐report mood ratings before and after the experiment. Men displayed higher aggression in both stress conditions, which corresponded to their ratings of state hostility. On the other hand, women in high stress delivered lower intensity shocks, and this decreased overt aggression was positively correlated with sadness ratings. However, women did not decrease their levels of shock duration (covert aggression) under high stress and showed equivalent shock duration compared with men in high stress.

Other advantages are that aggressiveness is induced quickly, at high levels, and the mice appear very sensitive to hormone manipulation following castration.",

Using data from 500 (58% female) university students from the four Russian sites of the International Dating Violence Study, we found gender differences in rates of IPV perpetration and in the association between binge drinking and IPV. Specifically, more females than males perpetrated IPV, and the associations between binge drinking and IPV were stronger for the female students than for the male students. In addition, antisocial traits and behavior (ATSB) were significantly related to both binge drinking and IPV perpetration for males and females. For males, the relatively weak associations between binge drinking and IPV perpetration disappeared once ASTB was accounted for. For females, the relationship decreased but remained significant when ATSB was statistically controlled. Path analyses confirmed that this pattern of relationships would be consistent with ATSB serving as a partial mediator between binge drinking and IPV perpetration. However, other alternative mediation and moderation models for the relationships between binge drinking, IPV perpetration, and ATSB could not be ruled out with this one-wave correlational study.",

At the class level, elite and poor women combine forces to victimize subelite women. Both levels of aggression involve competition over the scarce resource of socially desirable men and their support. Competition is due to the unequal access of the genders to opportunities for labor-force participation and hence different positions in the stratification system, the desire for hypergamous marriage, marital instability, changing role expectations, and the increased dependency of women on men.",

Drawing on previous work linking arousal and narrowed attentional focus, the model predicts that arousal will lead to behavior that is relatively disinhibited in situations in which promoting pressures to aggress are highly salient. In situations in which inhibitory pressures are more salient, the model predicts behavior that is relatively restrained. In the experiment, 81 male undergraduates delivered noise‐blasts against a provoking confederate while experiencing either high or low levels of physiological arousal and, at the same time, being exposed to cues that served either to promote or inhibit aggression. In addition to supporting the predictions of the model, this experiment provided some of the first evidence for enhanced control of aggression under conditions of heightened physiological arousal.

In the first experiment, two heterosexual groups, containing adult males unfamiliar to the other group, were merged. The two groups fought, and the smaller group was defeated. The alpha and beta males of the defeated group were singled out for repeated attack and both showed significant drops in circulating levels of testosterone. Both males were removed from the group during the first day, but testosterone levels did not recover to baseline levels for several days. The alpha male of the victorious group, on the other hand, showed a significant rise in testosterone, which was apparent only on the day following the merger. In order to study the influence of previous social familiarity on male reception into a group, another group was formed by removing males from the victorious group and placing them in a separate enclosure. The males in the new group established a dominance hierarchy unrelated to their previous social ranks with one another. Three months later, each of the six adult males remaining in the parent group was individually introduced into the new group for one day or less. Each of the males introduced into the new group accepted a social position at the lower end of the dominance hierarchy without regard to his previous rank relationships with the host males when they were all in the parent group. Even the alpha and beta males of the parent group were relegated to low rank positions in the new group, despite having ranked over each of the host males since birth. In contrast to the aggression directed at the unfamiliar males in the first experiment, a minimum of aggression was directed to the familiar males introduced into the new group in the second experiment. Although the males introduced accepted low social ranks, it appeared that each was readily integrated into the group with a minimum of aggressive interaction during the time he was scheduled to remain in the group. There were no significant changes in circulating levels of testosterone in any of the males during the introductions of familiar males to one another.",

Lactating females were more likely to attack male intruders than female intruders. The mate's presence reduced maternal attack in this strain, or (putting it conversely) aggression was generated in the male's absence. Removal of the mothers from their litters for four to five hours also suppressed maternal attack. Investigation of the bite targets in the maternal attack suggested that it is a defensive, rather than an offensive, response.",

Perpetrated, self‐reported violence included armed robbery, gang fighting, using a weapon in a fight, pulling a knife or gun on someone, or shooting or stabbing someone. Results showed that 11.3% of emergent adults had perpetrated at least one of these behaviors in the past year. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis partially supported the three theories for both men and women, beyond the contribution of violence in adolescence. The presence of Wave III violence was more likely given the unique contributions of unmarried status and economic risk. Moreover, and consistent with the theory of emerging adulthood, both sensation seeking and depression declined with age and contributed to the acknowledgement of Wave III violence, beyond the contribution of controls for Wave I violence (6 years earlier), demographics, age, gender, unmarried status, and economic risk. Findings of age‐related declines and gender differences in prevalence rates were consistent with previous research on nationally representative samples, and with the predictions of the three theories.

Findings partially confirm our hypotheses that we generated from earlier research into general antisocial behavior. For both genders, parent regulation and teacher regulation had a direct impact on bullying behavior. Parent connection and teacher connection also had an impact on bullying behavior, but these effects were indirect and were mediated by regulation and autonomy from parents and teachers. Some of the socialization processes had different impacts on bullying behavior for boys and girls. Parent autonomy and teacher autonomy had impact (although weak) on bullying behavior for boys only. In general, the variables related to the parents were of more importance for bullying behavior than the variables related to the teachers. Aggr. Behav. 34:460–474, 2008. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

In the free play session, the first principal component that emerged was consistent with a theoretical definition of dominance. This picture was disrupted by the introduction of candy in the second condition. However, a high correlation was found between the dominance hierarchies established in each situation.

Research strongly suggests that the effectiveness of firearms as a cause of death and injury may be due to their widespread availability, their lethality, and the impulsivity of their use. The investigation of a possible causal link between firearms and impulsive aggression led to Berkowitz and LePage's (1967) weapons effect experiment. The results suggested that weapons can increase the instigation to aggression in aroused an uninhibited individuals. The researchers reasoned that weapons might stimulate aggression by classical conditioning processes resulting from learned associations between aggressive acts and weapons. Although a few studies have failed to reproduce an aggression-enhancing effect of weapons, the original finding has been replicated in several countries with diverse subject groups both in field and laboratory settings. However, these studies also indicate that many individuals may react with anxiety or fear in the presence of weapons and inhibit aggressive reactions. Manipulations of evaluation apprehension, subject suspiciousness, and/or hypothesis awareness about the purpose of the weapons in the experiments all seem to lead to reduced levels of aggressive response in the presence of weapons. These findings offer a possible explanation for the few failures to replicate the original weapons effect; if researchers used apprehensive subjects or subjects who were aware of possible experimental deceptions, they were more likely to observe an inhibitory reaction rather than an aggression-enhancing effect of weapons.",

Analyses tested the hypotheses that self‐ and other‐directed aggression would tend to covary and display continuity from pre‐treatment to in‐treatment. Also tested were the hypotheses that youth with histories of co‐occurring self‐ and other‐directed aggression would show the highest levels of aggression during treatment and the greatest degree of personal and contextual risk on entering treatment. These hypotheses were largely supported. Exploratory analyses revealed interesting discontinuities in aggression (aggression emitted only before or during treatment) with critical implications for research and practice with youth receiving clinical care, especially those in institutional placements.

In this series of studies, there was a strong association between APT scores of expected use and escalation of discipline strategies and self‐reported disciplinary attitudes. APT scores were also associated with physical abuse potential as assessed by both a well‐established measure of child abuse potential (Child Abuse Potential Inventory) and another instrument designed specifically for use in pre‐parent populations (e.g., Adult–Adolescent Parenting Inventory‐2). This study provides new psychometric evidence to support the use of the APT to assess harsh parenting. Additionally, these data highlight the connection between acceptance and use of physical disciplinary strategies, propensity for disciplinary escalation, and risk for abuse perpetration. The findings are discussed in the context of Milner's Social Information Processing model [Milner, 2003] of abuse, which suggests that parental selection of disciplinary responding and the monitoring of disciplinary responding are key events in the disciplinary process. The APT may prove a useful adjunct to more commonly used self‐report measures to allow for multimethod assessment of risk for punitive parenting. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Hormones seem to play important roles in the regulation of human aggression. Multiple studies have confirmed that testosterone (T) levels exhibit complex relationships with aggression, dominance, and/or risk‐taking behavior. Some evidence suggests that cortisol (CORT) interacts with T and may also be associated with aspects of mood and aggression. However, almost no research to date has investigated the possibility that these neuroendocrine factors are associated with variations in political attitudes or with political aggression. During the second intifada , we tested the hypothesis that morning salivary T and/or salivary CORT levels might be associated with self‐rated aggression or with support for religio‐political aggression (RPA) among 14‐year‐old Palestinian boys living in Gaza. We obtained and averaged weekly 09:00 hr salivary measures of T and CORT for more than 1 month. Averaged morning T levels did not correlate with self‐rated aggression, but were positively associated with agreement with the statement “religious ends justify any means,” ( r = .355, P = .014) and marginally associated with a composite measure of support for RPA ( r = .247, P = .094). Average CORT levels were inversely correlated with self‐rated aggression ( r = −.328, P = .037) and with anger ( r = −.373, P = .016), but CORT levels were not associated with support for RPA or with the statement “religious ends justify any means.” Acknowledging that a modest sample size and methodological issues necessarily limit confidence in our conclusions, these results may represent the first findings regarding neurobiological correlates of support for political aggression.

A combination of self‐ and parent‐reports on the APSD ( n =229) revealed that the three‐facet model of psychopathic tendencies in youth was characterized by a similar constellation of personality traits as the psychopathic construct in adulthood [e.g., Hall, Benning and Patrick, 2004]. Specifically, low anxiety and trait aggression characterized the APSD Callous/Unemotional dimension, social dominance and trait aggression characterized the APSD Narcissism dimension, and disinhibition and low harm avoidance characterized the APSD Impulsivity dimension. The results add credence to the hypothesis that personality relationships to psychopathic tendencies emerge from an early age [Lynam, 2002] and dimensions of psychopathy in youth are associated with distinct personality profiles.

In Study 1, participants ( N =221) read one of three vignettes: no relationship termination, an “internal” rejection (involves an internal attribution to the rejected as cause of relationship ending), or an “external” rejection (external attributions for relationship demise). Next, participants experienced one of two conditions manipulating self‐regulation (no depletion vs. depletion). Finally, participants rated their likelihood of engaging in ORI (e.g. unwanted pursuit and/or aggression). Consistent with predictions, participants receiving an internal rejection reported higher aggression than participants experiencing an external rejection, especially when depleted of self‐regulation. Study 2 extended the design of Study 1 by adding in a screening survey of RS. Internal rejections still yielded more aggression than other conditions, but this was especially so when rejection‐sensitive persons were depleted of self‐regulation. In addition to providing support for the I 3 model of aggression, this research shows that not all types of rejection are created equal. Aggr.

Across two studies, a consistent pattern emerged compared with a control condition (a) exposure to evolutionary psychology theories had no observable impact on male judgments of men's criminal sexual behavior, whereas (b) exposure to social‐constructivist theories did affect judgments, leading men to evaluate sex crimes more harshly. Additional results (from Study 2) indicate that this effect is mediated by perceptions of male control over sexual urges. These results have implications for journalists, educators, and scientists.

The findings regarding same‐sex victimization supported the view that bullies select personally and interpersonally vulnerable targets in order to maximize their gains in status while minimizing loss of affection within their same‐sex peer group. Although low self‐esteem was a joint predictor of same‐ and other‐sex victimization, rejection and lack of friends among other‐sex peers failed to predict victimization by other‐sex bullies, and being perceived as popular among other‐sex peers increased the risk. Although the findings suggests that interpersonal risk factors for other‐sex victimization differ from those found for same‐sex victimization, they do not provide strong support for heterosexual interest being the basis for other‐sex target selection, as suggested by some previous literature. As about half of the study participants were involved in the K i V a antibullying program, we had the possibility to examine whether the program effects were similar for same‐ and other‐sex victimization. It turned out that in middle schools the program decreased only same‐sex victimization, whereas in elementary school the decrease was observed regardless of the sex composition of bully–victim dyads.

Specifically, we predicted that one reason for why individuals higher (rather than lower) in trait driving anger are more likely to aggress when provoked is because these individuals are more confident in their thoughts resulting from the provocation. Higher thought confidence, in turn, may influence the amount of anger experienced and the extent to which the anger translates into aggressive behavior. Study 1 found that participants higher in driving anger were more confident in their thoughts in a provoking situation and their thought confidence mediated the effect of trait driving anger on anger in response to the provocation. Using a manipulation of consistency, Study 2 found that thought confidence mediated the influence of anger on aggressive driving intentions, but only for individuals higher in driving anger.

    "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health concern. To date, risk factor research has not differentiated physical violence that leads to injury and/or fear (i.e., clinically significant IPV; CS-IPV) from general physical IPV. Isolating risk relations is necessary to best inform prevention and treatment efforts. The current study used an ecological framework and evaluated relations of likely risk factors within individual, family, workplace, and community levels with both CS-IPV and general IPV to determine whether they were related to one type of IPV, both, or neither for both men and women. Probable risk and promotive factors from multiple ecological levels of influence were selected from the literature and assessed, along with CS-IPV and general IPV, via an anonymous, web-based survey. The sample comprised US Air Force (AF) active duty members and civilian spouses (total N = 36,861 men; 24,331 women) from 82 sites worldwide. Relationship satisfaction, age, and alcohol problems were identified as unique risk factors (in the context of the 23 other risk factors examined) across IPV and CS-IPV for men and women. Other unique risk factors were identified that differed in prediction of IPV and CS-IPV. The results suggest a variety of both established and novel potential foci for indirectly targeting partner aggression and clinically-significant IPV by improving people's risk profiles at the individual, family, workplace, and community levels.

The study also manipulated the partner's behavior such that, in initial trials, the partner either delivered moderate blasts to the participant or no blasts at all. While accounting for broad trait aggression, those high in SP delivered louder noise blasts to a bogus partner when provoked but not when unprovoked. These individuals also delivered more maximum blasts to the partner and delivered maximum blasts earlier in the TCRT. The effects of SP became non-significant when the partner was initially non-aggressive. Similarly, an initially non-aggressive partner reduced participant aggression under later conditions of moderate provocation from the partner, but this effect became non-significant under subsequent high provocation from the partner. While being related to SP, SF did not influence provoked aggression.",

Assessments were made of stability of participant roles over time; inter-rater concordance among informants; discriminability; and relationships with sex, and likeability. Children tended to report themselves as victim and their peers as aggressors, especially for social exclusion. Nominations for aggressor showed highest stability over time and inter-rater concordance. Social exclusion showed different characteristics from other types of aggressive behavior in terms of its frequency and inter-rater concordance of role nominations. The type of defender (defender-stop or defender-tell) had different correlates with likeability. Findings are discussed in relation to different perspectives on social exclusion, and the defender role. Some different findings related specifically to social exclusion may be related to the particular nature of aggression or wang-ta in South Korea.",

    "abstract": "Feelings of revenge are a common human response to being hurt by others. Among crime victims of severe sexual or physical violence, significant correlations have been reported between revenge and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Homicide is one of the most severe forms of interpersonal violence. It is therefore likely that individuals bereaved by homicide experience high levels of revenge, which may hamper efforts to cope with traumatic loss. The relationship between revenge and psychological adjustment following homicidal loss has not yet been empirically examined. In the current cross‐sectional study, we used self‐report data from 331 spouses, family members and friends of homicide victims to examine the relationships between dispositional revenge and situational revenge on the one hand and symptom‐levels of PTSD and complicated grief, as well as indices of positive functioning, on the other hand. Furthermore, the association between revenge and socio‐demographic and offense‐related factors was examined. Participants were recruited from a governmental support organization, a website with information for homicidally bereaved individuals, and members of support groups. Levels of both dispositional and situational revenge were positively associated with symptoms of PTSD and complicated grief, and negatively with positive functioning. Participants reported significantly less situational revenge in cases where the perpetrator was a direct family member than cases where the perpetrator was an indirect family member, friend, or someone unknown. Homicidally bereaved individuals reported more situational revenge, but not more dispositional revenge than a sample of students who had experienced relatively mild interpersonal transgressions.

    "abstract": "Many test series have been developed to assess dog temperament and aggressive behavior, but most of them have been criticized for their relatively low predictive validity or being too long, stressful, and/or problematic to carry out. We aimed to develop a short and effective series of tests that corresponds with (a) the dog's bite history, and (b) owner evaluation of the dog's aggressive tendencies. Seventy‐three pet dogs were divided into three groups by their biting history; non‐biter, bit once, and multiple biter. All dogs were exposed to a short test series modeling five real‐life situations: friendly greeting, take away bone, threatening approach, tug‐of‐war, and roll over. We found strong correlations between the in‐test behavior and owner reports of dogs' aggressive tendencies towards strangers; however, the test results did not mirror the reported owner‐directed aggressive tendencies. Three test situations (friendly greeting, take‐away bone, threatening approach) proved to be effective in evoking specific behavioral differences according to dog biting history. Non‐biters differed from biters, and there were also specific differences related to aggression and fear between the two biter groups. When a subsample of dogs was retested, the test revealed consistent results over time. We suggest that our test is adequate for a quick, general assessment of human‐directed aggression in dogs, particularly to evaluate their tendency for aggressive behaviors towards strangers. Identifying important behavioral indicators of aggressive tendencies, this test can serve as a useful tool to study the genetic or neural correlates of human‐directed aggression in dogs. Aggr.

On the other hand, relational victimization was also significantly associated with decreases in externalizing problems (e.g., inattention, deception/lying) and increases in prosocial behavior. Physical aggression predicted increases in physical victimization, supporting hypotheses that children displaying physically aggressive behavior are likely to be reactive to negative peer interactions and endure future victimization.",

In the current experiment, 157 young men were romantically rejected by a sexualized or non-sexualized woman then given the opportunity to blast the woman with loud bursts of white noise. We tested whether the activation of sexual goals in men would mediate the relationship between sexualization and aggressive behavior after romantic rejection. We also tested whether behaving aggressively toward a woman after romantic rejection would increase men's feelings of sexual dominance. Results showed that interacting with a sexualized woman increased men's sex goals. Heightened sex goal activation, in turn, predicted increased aggression after romantic rejection. This result remained significant despite controlling for the effects of trait aggressiveness and negative affect. The findings suggest that heightened sex goal activation may lead men to perpetrate aggression against sexualized women who reject them.",

In a community sample of 307 youth (52% female; age range = 10-14 years), we tested whether (1) the association between RA and subsequent depressive symptoms was mediated through social problems and (2) a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs53576) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) moderated this indirect association between RA and depression, where GG homozygotes are predicted to be more sensitive to the effects of social problems than A-allele carriers. Youth-reported RA and depressive symptoms were measured using a structured interview and a questionnaire, respectively. DNA was extracted from saliva collected with Oragene kits. Consistent with the interpersonal theory of depression, the association between relational aggression and subsequent depressive symptoms was mediated by social problems. This indirect effect was further moderated by rs53576 genotype, such that GG homozygotes showed a stronger mediation effect than A-carriers. These results suggest that rs53576 variants confer vulnerability for depression within the context of interpersonal risk factors, such that youth with the GG genotype may be particularly sensitive to the social consequences resulting from RA.",

In individual or collective answering conditions, 104 soccer and 98 ice hockey players viewed videotaped aggressive acts and completed a questionnaire, including measures of the perceived legitimacy of videotaped aggression, of the teammates, coach, and self attitudes toward transgressions (modified TNQ), of the moral disengagement in sport (modified MDSS‐S), and of self‐reported aggressive behavior. A multilevel analysis confirmed a strong polarization effect on the perception of instrumental aggression, the videotaped aggressive acts appearing more tolerated in the collective than in the individual answering condition. Using a structural equation modeling, we found that the moral disengagement, which mediates the effects of perceived coach and ego attitudes toward transgressions, correlates positively with the tolerance of hostile aggression within teams, and with the level of aggressive acts reported by the participants.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study expands previous work by examining individual and national level effects of economic deprivation on partner violence among college students. Three main hypotheses were tested: (1) individual level economic deprivation (i.e., ability to meet daily needs and family income) is associated with partner violence, (2) gross national income is associated with the mean rates of partner violence across nations, and (3) the association between individual level economic deprivation and partner violence varies according to the economic national context as measured by gross national income. Data for 14,090 participants from 31 nations came from the International Dating Violence Study that queried university students about violence in their relationships and relevant risk factors. A series of overdispersed Poisson hierarchical linear regression models were specified to test the hypotheses. Ability to meet daily needs, but not family income, was associated with rates of partner violence. Gross national income was also associated with mean rates of partner violence across nations as well as the relationships between ability to meet daily and partner violence and between family income and partner violence. The findings show the importance of context, as indicated by national economic standing, on rates of partner violence. Not only do economically deprived individuals experience more partner violence, but those living in poorer nations experience more partner violence, regardless of individual economic deprivation. Limitations of the study include a non‐random sample and substantial variation in the study sites beyond economic standing. Nonetheless, findings indicate efforts to confront partner violence must also call for cross‐national economic development. Aggr. Behav. 39:247–256, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "I 3 theory assumes that aggressive behavior is dependent on three orthogonal processes (i.e., Instigator , Impellance , and Inhibition ). Previous studies showed that Impellance (trait aggressiveness, retaliation tendencies) better predicted aggression when Instigator was strong and Inhibition was weak. In the current study, we predicted that another Impellance (i.e., normative beliefs about aggression) might predict aggression when Instigator was absent and Inhibition was high (i.e., the perfect calm proposition). In two experiments, participants first completed the normative beliefs about aggression questionnaire. Two weeks later, participants' self‐control resources were manipulated either using the Stroop task (study 1, N = 148) or through an “e‐crossing” task (study 2, N = 180). Afterwards, with or without being provoked, participants played a game with an ostensible partner where they had a chance to aggress against them. Study 1 found that normative beliefs about aggression negatively and significantly predicted aggressive behavior only when provocation was absent and self‐control resources were not depleted. In Study 2, normative beliefs about aggression negatively predicted aggressive behavior at marginal significance level only in the “no‐provocation and no‐depletion” condition. In conclusion, the current study provides partial support for the perfect calm proposition and I 3 theory. Aggr. Behav. 41:544–555, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that ostracism-the experience of being ignored and excluded-has negative effects on all of us, young and old. Using a Cyberball paradigm, the present research replicates the effects of ostracism on the moods (anger, anxiety, happiness, and anger) and fundamental needs (belongingness, control, meaningful existence, and self-esteem) of children (Study 1) and then extends the literature by examining the role of the number of ostracizers and inclusive members in this process by randomly assigning children to conditions varying in degree of ostracism (Study 2). Results of both studies showed that experiencing ostracism strongly and negatively affected all moods and fundamental needs-with the exception of anxiety. Study 2 in addition showed that the ratio of excluders to inclusive group members had different effects across outcomes. In all cases, complete ostracism produced the worst outcomes, suggesting that the presence of even a single ally reduces children's distress. For sadness, unanimous ostracism seemed particularly toxic. In some cases, facing two ostracizers produced significantly worse outcomes than only one, suggesting that consensual rejection might drive the negative effects on happiness, and sense of belonging, control, and meaningful existence. For self-esteem, only one ostracizer (in the presence of two inclusive members) was sufficient to induce a negative effect. Aggr. Behav. 43:190-203, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish have been introduced as a model organism in behavioral neuroscience and biological psychiatry, increasing the breadth of findings using fish to study the neurobiology of aggression. Phenotypic differences between leopard and longfin zebrafish were exploited in order to elucidate the role of phasic serotonin in aggressive displays on this species. The present study, revealed differences in aggressive display between leopard and longfin zebrafish, and a discrepant effect of acute fluoxetine in both populations. In mirror‐induced aggression, leopard animals showed higher display latencies than longfin, as well as lower display duration and frequency (Experiment 1). Moreover, 2.5 mg/kg fluoxetine decreased the duration and frequency of display in longfin, but not leopard; and 5 mg/kg fluoxetine increased display frequency in leopard, but not longfin (Experiment 2). It is suggested that zebrafish from the longfin phenotype show more aggressive motivation and readiness in the mirror‐induced aggression test than leopard, and that acute fluoxetine increases aggression in leopard and decreased it in longfin zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "This editorial to the special section \"Automatic Processes in Aggression: Conceptual and Assessment Issues\" introduces major research lines, all of which culminate in recent advances in the measurement of automatic components in aggressive behavior. Researchers of almost all psychological disciplines have stressed increasingly the importance of automatic components to gain a comprehensive psychological understanding of human behavior. This is reflected in current dual-process theories according to which both controlled processes and rather automatic processes elicit behavior in a synergistic or antagonistic way. As a consequence, complementing self-reports (assumed to assess predominantly controlled processes) by the use of implicit measures (assumed to assess predominantly automatic processes) has become common practice in various domains. We familiarize the reader with the three contributions that illuminate how such a distinction can further our understanding of human aggression. At the same time, it becomes evident that there is a long way that method-oriented researchers need to go before we can fully comprehend how to best measure automatic processes in aggression. We see the present special section as an invigorating call to contribute to this endeavor. Aggr. Behav. 41:44-50 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Observers appear to be able to assess aggressiveness from male fWHR, but implications for interpersonal distance preferences have not yet been determined. This study utilized a novel computerized stop-distance task to examine interpersonal space preferences of female participants who envisioned being approached by a man; men's faces photographed posed in neutral facial expressions were shown in increasing size to mimic approach. We explored the effect of the men's fWHR, their behavioral aggression (measured previously in a computer game), and women's ratings of the men's aggressiveness, attractiveness, and masculinity on the preferred interpersonal distance of 52 German women. Hierarchical linear modelling confirmed the relationship between the fWHR and trait judgements (ratings of aggressiveness, attractiveness, and masculinity). There were effects of fWHR and actual aggression on the preferred interpersonal distance, even when controlling statistically for men's and the participants' age. Ratings of attractiveness, however, was the most influential variable predicting preferred interpersonal distance. Our results extend earlier findings on fWHR as a cue of aggressiveness in men by demonstrating implications for social interaction. In conclusion, women are able to accurately detect aggressiveness in emotionally neutral facial expressions, and adapt their social distance preferences accordingly.",

    "abstract": "Research has demonstrated an association between childhood trauma exposure and adolescent aggression. This association may be explained by rejection sensitivity, defined as anger, or anxiety in the anticipation of rejection, which can be a consequence of trauma exposure. Callous‐unemotional (CU) traits also are associated with trauma exposure and aggressive behavior; however, research has not yet investigated the interactive roles that rejection sensitivity and CU traits play in the relation between trauma exposure and aggression. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the role of rejection sensitivity in the association between trauma exposure and aggression, and whether this indirect effect was moderated by CU traits. Participants included 380 detained youth (98 girls, 282 boys) who completed self‐report measures of trauma exposure, angry, and anxious rejection sensitivity, CU traits, and aggression. Results of moderated mediation demonstrated that the relation between trauma exposure and aggression exhibited an indirect effect through angry rejection sensitivity, but only at moderate or high levels of CU traits. This pattern was not found for anxious rejection sensitivity. Results suggest that interventions aimed to decrease aggressive behavior in traumatized adolescents may benefit from considering how youth respond to rejection, as well as whether youth endorse CU traits, as this may help to limit further involvement in the juvenile justice system after release.",

Participants were a racially diverse college sample of self‐identified heterosexual men ( N = 104) between the ages of 18–35. Men completed a measure of hegemonic masculinity and engaged in a laboratory paradigm in which they and three male confederates watched a female confederate, who reported a strong dislike of sexual content in the media, view a sexually explicit film which they could stop at any time. Prior to the woman viewing the film, participants were randomly assigned to a peer norm manipulation wherein the male confederates set a misogynistic or ambiguous norm. Results indicated the presence of a misogynistic peer norm decreased the likelihood and speed of intervention. Among men exposed to misogynistic, compared to ambiguous, peer norms, men who strongly endorsed the status male role norm were less likely to display prosocial bystander behavior. Findings indicate that exposure to peers who sexually objectify and disrespect women decreases prosocial bystander intervention. Further, these findings provide evidence that misogynistic peer norms heighten men's adherence to a hegemonic masculinity that men should attain social status, thereby deterring bystander behavior for sexual aggression.",

In this paper we concentrate on one of the most fundamental distinctions in groups: That between leaders and followers. Our main goal is to investigate the comparative propensity of leaders and followers to engage in political violence. In a sample of individuals who have committed ideologically motivated political crimes in the United States ( N = 1,331). we found that even though leaders were more ideologically committed to the group's goals and ideologies, they were at the same time less likely to engage in violent acts. Moreover, we found that leaders in radical criminal organizations shared many characteristics with leaders in noncriminal organizations. Specifically, in comparison to followers, they were more often male, older, and they were more likely to belong to an ethnic majority. We consider implications for future research and policy of the fundamental conclusion that compared to leaders, followers in terrorist organizations are more likely to engage in violent acts.",

In contrast, for individuals with relatively higher scores in trait aggressiveness, there was no difference in attitudes toward violence between those who received the anti‐violence intervention and those assigned to the control group. In fact, the anti‐violence messages resulted in a boomerang effect, increasing the favorability of attitudes toward violence in one of the studies. Aggr.

This distinction has been supported by a number of variable‐based and factor analytic studies. Due to high inter‐correlations, however, the reactive—proactive aggression distinction may not be entirely useful for understanding how group or individual aggressive behavior varies in children and adolescents. Drawing on a sample of primary school‐aged children ( N = 242) aged 7–12 years, this study sought to determine whether reactive and proactive aggression could be distinguished at the variable‐level and the person‐level in children. Exploratory Factor Analysis of data from an aggression instrument measuring both functions and forms of aggression, found a two‐factor construct of aggression constituted by a reactive and proactive aggression factor. A person‐based analysis was then conducted after classifying children according to the presence of reactive and/or proactive aggression. Discriminant function analysis was used to discern whether classifications on the basis of aggression function produced meaningful distinctions in terms of antisocial traits and emotional valence and intensity measures. Two functions were identified which distinguished children with different combinations of reactive and proactive aggression. Reactive‐only aggressive children were defined primarily by high levels of impulsivity, while proactive‐only children were defined primarily by higher levels of antisocial traits. Children high in both types of aggression exhibited both the presence of antisocial traits and impulsivity. Contrary to recent findings, this suggests that differences in aggression functions remain meaningful at the person level in children. Implications for interventions are discussed.",

In the present sample, 25.1% of teachers reported that they experienced at least one of the six forms of victimization from students in the past school year. Prevalence of teacher victimization ranged from 4.0% (physical victimization) to 16.8% (social victimization). Male teachers were more likely to experience all forms of TV and homeroom teachers were more likely than non‐homeroom teachers to experience social TV. Schools with fewer students, but higher number of teachers, also had higher levels of TV.

A community sample of 211 children (51% male; 9–12 years; 55% Caucasian) participated in our cross‐sectional correlational design. Social threat attentional bias was measured through task performance on dot‐probe, attentional shifting, and temporal order judgment tasks; each task measured different attentional processes. Aggression was measured by parent‐ and child‐report. Hostile intent attributions were measured through child responses to vignettes involving peer conflict or rejection. Attentional bias to social threat within early phases of attentional processing (i.e., attentional prioritization; stimuli presented for &lt;200 ms in temporal order judgment task) was significantly and positively related to both aggression and hostile intent attributions. Attentional bias to social threat within attentional orienting (stimuli presented for 500 ms in dot‐probe task) was positively and significantly related to hostile intent attributions. Attentional bias to social threat within attentional shifting (stimuli presented for multiple seconds) was not significantly related to aggression or hostile intent attributions. Higher levels of aggression and of hostile intent attributions were associated with an attentional bias to social threat within early, but not later, phases of attentional processing. These results suggest specificity in identifying dysfunctional attentional processes that may underlie aggression and aggression‐related cognitive biases.",

The first three waves were consecutive annual assessments, and the fourth was conducted 4 years after the third wave, when the three age cohorts were 14, 17, and 20 years old, respectively. Based on social‐cognitive‐ecological models of the development of aggression (Dubow et al., 2009, Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review, 12, 113‐126; Huesmann, 1998) and models of the development of beliefs about the “other,” (Bar‐Tal, 2004, European Journal of Social Psychology, 34, 677‐701; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986), we predicted that serious violent outcomes directed toward both the in‐group and the out‐group would be related to both concurrent and to persistent‐past exposure to ethnic political violence. Bivariate regression models (prior to including covariates) indicated that both early cumulative exposure to ethnic‐political violence during childhood and adolescence and concurrent exposure during late adolescence/early adulthood predicted all six serious violent and antisocial outcomes. When we added to the models the covariates of ethnic subgroup, age, sex, parents’ education, and youths’ prior physical aggression, concurrent exposure to ethnic‐political violence was still significantly associated with a greater likelihood of concurrently perpetrating all six serious violent and nonviolent forms of antisocial behavior, and earlier cumulative exposure remained significantly related to three of these: severe physical aggression, participating in violent demonstrations, and our overall index of violent/antisocial behavior.",

Parricide offenders in our sample were most often male, unmarried, and unemployed, with a third of offenders diagnosed with schizophrenia; 28% had been in contact with mental health services before the offense. The latent class analysis resulted in three types of parricide offenders: middle‐aged with affective disorder, previously abused, and seriously mentally Ill, which confirmed, to an extent, Heide's typology.

Using autoregressive latent trajectory models with structured residuals (ALT-SR) and four waves (ages 11, 13, 15, and 17) of longitudinal data from the normative z-proso study (n = 1526, 52% male), we evaluated the developmental relations between ADHD and bullying using both self- and teacher-reported ADHD symptom data. Analyses suggested that ADHD symptoms primarily increase the risk of bullying perpetration, with a within-person effect of ADHD symptoms on bullying perpetration symptoms identified across ages 13-15 (β = .13) and ages 15-17 (β = .19) based on self-reported ADHD symptoms and a similar effect identified across ages 11-13 (β = .24) and 13-15 (β = .29) based on teacher-reported inattention symptoms. There were also some indications of reciprocal effects and effects involving victimization that merit further exploration in future research. Results imply that the content of bullying intervention and prevention programs should take account of ADHD symptoms to ensure that those with elevated symptoms can benefit as much as their typically developing peers. This will involve addressing bullying perpetration that may reflect impulsive/reactive aggression and impaired social skills rather than instrumental aggression. Further, programs should go beyond classical curriculum/classroom-based delivery to ensure that individuals with elevated ADHD symptoms can be successfully engaged.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present work investigated the influence of experimentally manipulated relative deprivation (RD) on aggressive behavior in a game context. Participants experienced personal RD as the difference between own rewards and the rewards of a fictitious other player. Going beyond previous research, three yet‐unexplored moderators of the RD–aggression link were experimentally tested: In Experiment 1 ( N = 157), we tested the effect of the scarcity of resources one is deprived of, and the intensity of the RD experience in terms of the magnitude of the disadvantaged comparison. In Experiment 2 ( N = 195), we investigated whether aggressive behavior is influenced by imposing possible or actual sanctions (i.e., costs) for aggression. The results show effects on aggressive behavior toward the other player that were mediated by the personal perception of RD and that only actual but not possible costs eliminated this indirect effect. Implications for the aggression‐related behavioral consequences of RD are discussed.",

Findings from the two studies revealed that psychopathy-linked narcissism as assessed by the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD; Frick & Hare, 2001; Antisocial process screening device. Toronto: Multi-Health Systems.) and vulnerable narcissism as assessed using the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI; Pincus et al., 2009; Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory. Psychological Assessment, 21, 365-379) significantly moderated the relation between CU traits and aggression in adolescents. Conversely, non-pathological narcissism assessed by the Narcissistic Personality Inventory for Children (NPIC; Barry, Frick, & Killian, 2003; The relation of narcissism and self-esteem to conduct problems in children. Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 32, 139-152) and PNI grandiose narcissism did not significantly impact this relation. These results suggest that forms of narcissism most closely connected to internalizing problems combined with CU traits are associated with relatively heightened aggression in youth.

There is also an extensive body of literature analyzing reasons for mothers' violent behavior. Among fathers, reasons are less well studied, resulting in the lack of a comprehensive picture of paternal child abuse. In this study, 20 child-, parent-, and family-related factors have been included in a combined analysis to assess which of these may pose a risk for fathers' severe violent behavior toward their children. The study is based on merged data from Finland and Sweden, in which an anonymous survey was answered by parents, based on representative samples of parents with 0-12-year-old children. The merged data set included 679 fathers and analyses were carried out using logistic regression models. Six percent of the fathers had committed severe violent acts, that is, slapped, hit, punched, kicked, bit, hit/tried to hit their child with an object or shook (under 2-year-old) their child at least once during the 12 months preceding the survey. Corporal punishment experienced by the fathers when they were children, or used by the father as a method of discipline, strongly increased the likelihood of severe violent acts. The findings emphasize the importance of preventing all forms of corporal punishment in seeking to minimize the occurrence of severe physical violence by fathers toward their children. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Difficulty recognizing negative emotions (NEs) in children is linked to increased antisocial traits and externalizing problems. However, crucial aspects of this relation remain unclear, such as: whether NE recognition is associated with externalizing problems in general or only a particular subcomponent (i.e., aggression); whether subcomponents of NE recognition (i.e., insensitivity and misspecifications) are relatively more important; and how these relations change over the course of development. We assessed emotion recognition, overt aggression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms in an ethnically diverse sample of Canadian children ( N = 150; 4‐year‐olds, N = 148; 8‐year‐olds) and followed up with them 1 year later (86.9% retention). Emotion recognition was assessed using a behavioral task and caregivers reported on children's externalizing symptoms. Children with lower NE recognition had higher initial, but not subsequent, overt aggression, even when controlling for nonaggressive externalizing symptoms (i.e., ADHD and ODD symptoms). NE recognition was not concurrently or longitudinally associated with nonaggressive externalizing symptoms. Age and gender did not moderate these findings. Both higher NE insensitivity (e.g., reporting a sad face appears neutral) and misspecifications (e.g., reporting a sad face appears angry) were significantly associated with higher concurrent overt aggression. In conclusion, both NE insensitivity and misspecifications were found to be uniquely important for children's overt aggression. These findings highlight the importance of different forms of NE recognition and differentiating between aggressive and nonaggressive externalizing problems in children.",

Accordingly, we examined the self‐reported use of indirect aggression from age 10 to 22 in a randomly drawn sample of 704 Canadians. A person‐centered approach was used to capture intraindividual change and heterogeneity in development. Four childhood (age 10–18) indirect aggression trajectories were identified: (1) a very low decreasing group (64.8%), (2) a low decreasing group (26.0%), (3) a low‐to‐moderate increasing group (5.1%), and (4) a moderate increasing group (4.1%). There were more girls than boys in the moderate increasing group (75.9% vs. 24.1%). Two adulthood (age 19–22) indirect aggression trajectory groups were also identified: (1) a low decreasing group (82.6%), and (2) a moderate stable group (17.4%). No sex differences were found among adults' use across the two trajectories. When we examined the prediction of indirect aggression use in adulthood from indirect aggression use in childhood, we found that children who followed a moderate increasing trajectory from age 10 to 18 were nine times more likely to follow a moderate stable trajectory from age 19 to 22, while children who followed a low‐to‐moderate increasing trajectory across childhood were 14 times more likely to follow a moderate stable trajectory across adulthood (compared to the very low decreasing group). Given the negative impact indirect aggression has on others, intervening early to derail this pattern of abuse is justified.",

This study aims to investigate (a) the mediating role of anger rumination in the association between OVVG and OAB and (b) the moderating role of self‐control in the relationship between anger rumination and OAB. A total of 595 Chinese college students ( M age = 19.59 years, SD age = 1.40) completed measurements regarding OVVG, anger rumination, self‐control, and OAB. The correlation analyses showed that OVVG was significantly positively associated with anger rumination and OAB. Mediation analyses revealed anger rumination partially mediated the link between OVVG and OAB. Moderated mediation further indicated that anger rumination was not associated with OAB for individuals with high levels of self‐control. However, for those with low levels of self‐control, anger rumination was significantly associated with OAB. These findings suggest that the improvement of self‐control and the decline of anger rumination could be a practicable way to address the issue of OAB effectively.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we examine whether youth who are exposed to more weapons violence are subsequently more likely to behave violently with weapons. We use data collected with a 3-cohort, 4-wave, 10-year longitudinal study of 426 high-risk youth from Flint, Michigan, who were second, fourth, or ninth-graders in 2006-2007. The data were obtained from individual interviews with the youth, their parents, and their teachers, from archival school and criminal justice records, and from geo-coded criminal offense data. These data show that early exposure to weapons violence significantly correlates at modest levels with weapon carrying, weapon use or threats-to-use, arrests for weapons use, and criminally violent acts 10 years later. Multiple regression analyses, controlling for children's initial aggressiveness, intellectual achievement, and parents' income, education, and aggression, reveal statistically significant independent 10-year effects: (1) more early exposure to weapon use within the family predicts more using or threatening to use a gun; (2) more cumulative early violent video game playing predicts more gun using or threatening to use weapons, and normative beliefs that gun use is acceptable; (3) more cumulative early exposure to neighborhood gun violence predicts more arrests for a weapons crime; and (4) more cumulative early exposure to movie violence predicts more weapon carrying. We argue that youth who observe violence with weapons, whether in the family, among peers, or through the media or video games, are likely to be infected from exposure with a social-cognitive-emotional disease that increases their own risk of behaving violently with weapons later in life.",

Hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed that teachers who reported more frequent teacher victimization perceived a lower level of teaching efficacy; however, teachers in schools with a higher level of teacher victimization scores at the school level perceived a higher level of teaching efficacy. Although school climate was positively related to teacher well-being at both teacher and school levels, the negative association between teacher victimization and teachers' subjective well-being at the teacher level was exacerbated in schools with a more positive school climate at the school level. The significant cross-level moderating effect of school-level school climate in the association between teacher-level victimization and subjective well-being was consistent with the \"healthy context paradox\" but contradicted with the \"emotion contagion hypothesis.\" Our findings support the risk influence of teacher victimization and the promotive role of positive school climate on teachers' subjective well-being. Our results also indicate that teachers in schools with a more positive and collective perception of school climate tend to be more attuned to the negative influences of teacher victimization on their subjective well-being than teachers in schools with a less positive and collective perception of school climate.",

Although the influencing factors of cyberbullying have been explored in the literature, less is known of the longitudinal effects of relative deprivation on cyberbullying and the mediating mechanisms underlying the effect.

A total of 1143 undergraduates (62.9% women, mean age = 19.46, standard deviation [ SD ] = 0.95) participated in three rounds of a longitudinal survey with an interval of 6 months and completed a series of self‐reported questionnaires assessing relative deprivation, revenge, and cyberbullying. The results of random intercept cross‐lagged panel model showed that at between‐person level, the random intercepts of relative deprivation, revenge, and cyberbullying were positively associated with each other. At within‐person level, relative deprivation and revenge could predict each other over time, and revenge longitudinally predicted cyberbullying. Moreover, revenge mediated the longitudinal effect of relative deprivation on cyberbullying. The results support and develop the view of the general aggression model and deepen our understanding of the development mechanism of cyberbullying.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The relation between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and aggression is well documented; however, the processes that account for higher levels of aggression associated with ADHD in the course of daily life are little understood. The current study used ecological momentary assessment to explore how ADHD traits relate to individual differences in perceiving provocation from others and the resultant aggressive behaviors; and the strengths of the links between provocation and aggression in the flow of daily life. A dynamic structural equation model was fit using data from a subpopulation of young adults involved in the longitudinal z‐proso study ( n = 259, median‐age 20). Data on provocation and aggression was collected at four quasi‐random time periods per day over a 14‐day period. Individuals with higher ADHD trait levels reported higher instances of provocation and aggression, with ADHD traits significantly moderating aggression inertia such that those with higher levels of ADHD traits showed greater persistence of aggressive behavior over time. However, ADHD trait levels did not significantly moderate any of the observed cross‐lagged effects. Our findings suggest that individuals with higher levels of ADHD traits are at greater risk of exposure to interpersonal interactions involving interpersonal provocation, show higher levels of aggressive behavior in daily life, and find it more difficult to reduce their aggression once triggered. These findings support the importance of targeting factors such as social skills and emotion regulation that may underpin the increased difficulties in interpersonal interactions often experienced by individuals with high levels of ADHD symptoms.",

The present study examined the role of cognitive distortions in mediating relationships between EMS and aggression in adults as a function of sex. Participants were 59 women (Mage = 34.7 years, standard deviation [SD] = 8.0) and 86 men (Mage = 39.3 years, SD = 13.2) who completed the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form-V3, the How I Think Questionnaire of cognitive distortions, and the Buss-Warren Aggression Questionnaire. Multiple mediation analysis identified EMS domain impaired limits to be uniquely and directly related to aggression, and the domain impaired autonomy to be indirectly related via a range of cognitive distortions. Multigroup analyses revealed no sex differences in these relationships, and analysis of covariance with age as a covariate revealed no sex differences in levels of EMS, cognitive distortion, or aggression. The results suggest that impaired limits and impaired autonomy are EMS domains of relevance to aggression regardless of sex. Furthermore, in the case of impaired autonomy, self-serving, proaggression cognitive distortions appear to be involved. Interventions for aggression may thus benefit by focusing on clients with entitlement/grandiosity traits indicative of impaired limits, and vulnerability/dependence traits indicative of impaired autonomy, and in the latter case consider addressing the self-serving cognitions that enable the expression of aggression in these clients.",

Furthermore, there is limited cross‐national research evaluating similarities and differences in bullying victimization and its associations with mental health. The current study addressed gaps in the literature by evaluating cognitive and affective responses to stress (i.e., emotion regulation, rumination, and distress tolerance) as potential mediators of the link between recalled bullying victimization and current depressive symptoms among 5909 (70.6% female) college students from seven countries. Results revealed specific indirect associations of bullying victimization through distress tolerance and three out of four facets of rumination, as well as a persistent direct association of childhood bullying on adulthood depression. Emotion regulation strategies were not significantly associated with bullying victimization and did not mediate its association with depressive symptoms. Constrained multigroup models indicated that results were invariant across country and gender. Findings provide evidence of statistical mediation in a cross‐sectional sample and await replication in prospective studies. Rumination and distress tolerance may be promising targets for resilience‐promoting interventions among children experiencing peer victimization. Ongoing research is needed to clarify cross‐national patterns in childhood bullying, identify additional mediators accounting for the remaining direct association, and evaluate emotion regulation as a potential moderator of associations between bullying victimization and adult mental health.",

Prior infant studies found both reaching and visual preferences for the prosocial over the antisocial agents. However, whether the attribution of either positive or negative valence to agents' actions involved in an aggressive chasing interaction can be inferred by both reaching behaviors and visual attention deployment (i.e., disengagement of visual attention) is still an open question. Here we presented 7‐month‐old infants ( N = 92) with events displaying an aggressive chasing interaction. By using preferential reaching and an attentional task (i.e., overlap paradigm), we assessed whether and how infants evaluate aggressive chasing interactions. The results demonstrated that young infants prefer to reach the victim over the aggressor, but neither agent affects visual attention. Moreover, such reaching preferences emerged only when dynamic cues and emotional face‐like features were congruent with agents' social roles. Overall, these findings suggested that infants' evaluations of aggressive interactions are based on infants' sensitivity to some kinematic cues that characterized agents' actions and, especially, to the congruency between such motions and the face‐like emotional expressions of the agents.",

    "abstract": "We report on two studies of anger and aggression in women. One study concerns an experimental study of anger induction in aggressive and non-aggressive sportswomen. It was found that sports choice in itself, contrary to expectation, does not predict anger arousal and aggressive behavior in the laboratory. However, at an individual level the anger proneness of the subject, as measured by a questionnaire we developed, was related to the intensity of aggressive behavior and subjectively reported anger. The second study concerns the activating effects of androgens on aggression and anger proneness. In a group of 22 female-to-male transsexuals, a battery of anger proneness and aggression questionnaires was administered twice: shortly before and 3 months after the start of androgen treatment. Administration of androgens was clearly associated with an increaese in anger proneness, although there were no changes in several aspects of overt aggressive behavior. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Crowding has been viewed as a factor eliciting increased levels of aggression and tension in gregarious animals. The present study tested predictions derived from two models, the \"density/aggression\" model and the \"active coping\" model, which have been proposed to explain the responses of primates to crowding. In particular, we investigated the responses of a well-established group of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to short-term crowding. The group was periodically crowded for 2-3 hr into a familiar area. Control observations were carried out when the monkeys were in a six times larger enclosure. Data from 42 individuals belonging to different age-sex classes showed that only mild forms of aggression increased under the crowded condition. Crowding also resulted in a decrease in counteraggression, allogrooming, playing, and exploring the environment, while it produced an increase in huddling with companions. The frequency of reconciliation and redirection was not affected by crowding. These findings do not support either of the models but suggest that macaques adopt a \"conflict-avoidance strategy\" during short-term crowding. They reduce the risk of severe aggression in an environment where interindividual distances are small by simply decreasing the level of activity. Interestingly, however, when aggression occurs during crowding, tension reduction mechanisms such as reconciliation and redirection are used as often as in control conditions. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We assessed the role of trait anger and anger expression style on competitive/aggressive decision making and responding. In a 100‐trial iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD), with instructions to simulate wartime interactions, competition/aggression was defined as “attacking the opponent,” and “waiting for troop reinforcements” was the noncompetitive alternative response. Prior to play, 92 university student players completed the State‐Trait Anger Expression Inventory. They were then paired to play the IPD against partners of similar or dissimilar trait anger levels. At postplay, the State Anger scale was readministered. Results showed significant preplay to postplay increases in state anger, with greater increases shown by high trait anger players. Thus, high trait anger players were especially subject to arousal. Players in the high trait anger group made more competitive/attack responses, and they were more likely to do so when paired with a high trait anger partner. As a result of the high level of competitive/aggressive play, both groups ended with a negative troop count. Trait anger as a general personality temperament was predictive of state anger, competitive/attack responses, and the number of trials before a retaliation was made. The expressive style of anger‐control was also related to manner of play. Trait anger had strong direct and indirect effects through anger control on the number of competitive attack responses. It was concluded that trait anger, especially trait anger/temperament, and anger control difficulties may be toxic personality factors in decision making and competitive behavior. Aggr.

In light of these findings, the present study aimed to (1) devise questionnaires measuring social representations of physical, verbal, and indirect aggression, suitable for use with children aged 7 to 11 years; (2) examine sex and age differences in these questionnaires; and (3) compare representations of physical aggression with representations of indirect aggression for both boys and girls. Results showed that compared with girls, boys held more instrumental representations of all three forms of aggression, whereas compared with boys, girls held more expressive representations. Likewise, children aged 10 to 11 years held more instrumental representations of all three forms of aggression compared with children aged 7 to 8 years. There were no differences between representations of physical vs. representations of indirect aggression for girls or for boys. Sex and age differences were discussed in terms of sex roles and a developmental change in children's views on aggressive retaliation.

Male and female adult prisoners (n = 406) were required to complete a self‐report behavioural checklist (Direct and Indirect Prisoner Behaviour Checklist [DIPC]) that addressed the level of bullying behaviour at their present institution. Prisoners were also required to complete a questionnaire (Bullying Social Problem Solving Questionnaire [BSPSQ]) that provided them with five different bullying situations and asked them what would be the consequences if they were to respond aggressively to each. Four categories of prisoners were examined: pure bullies, pure victims, those who reported both bullying others and being victimised themselves (bully/victims), and those not involved in bullying/victimisation. Pure bullies reported significantly more positive than negative consequences of aggression compared with the overall category mean in response to theft‐related bullying. Bully/victims reported significantly more positive than negative consequences compared with the overall category mean in response to indirect and indirect‐physical bullying. Those not involved reported significantly more negative than positive consequences compared with the overall category mean in response to all scenarios except one involving indirect‐physical bullying. Males reported significantly more positive than negative consequences compared with females for all types of bullying. Aggr. Behav. 28:257–272, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Dominant-subordinate pregrouping attack differences suggested that the males becoming dominant are those showing more persistent and higher level attack. For six colonies showing dominant-subordinate behavioral differences, pregrouping defense tests failed to predict subordinate status. However, pregrouping defense scores were reliably correlated with subordinate pre-postgrouping change scores for voluntary ethanol consumption. Subordinates showed higher ranked ethanol consumption than dominants, but these groups were not different on pregrouping ethanol consumption. Subordinate postgrouping ethanol consumption was positively correlated with pregrouping attack toward an adult intruder, consonant with previous findings that highly aggressive subordinates are the targets of more intense attack by dominants. These results provide further support for a view that subordination stress increases voluntary ethanol consumption in male rats and suggest some additional individual differences factors that may be involved in increased ethanol consumption for male subordinates. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Selection experiments and game theory models have revealed that the changes in agonistic behavior following selection for rapid growth rate of fish depend on the access of food. If food is spatially restricted and in excess of demand, the intensity of agonistic behaviors will decrease. This prediction was tested in an experiment on wild and sea‐ranched brown trout ( Salmo trutta L.) fry originating from a common stock. Agonistic behavior, activity, and specific growth rate were studied in tanks (56 × 56 cm) at high (159.4 fry/m 2 ) and low (9.6 fry/m 2 ) stocking densities given either a large or small food ration (3.0% and 1.5%, respectively, food per total body weight and day). Observations were done during 4 days in each trial. Generally, fry of sea‐ranched origin had a higher growth rate. No differences in activity were found. Intensity of agonistic behavior was higher among wild groups. There was a tendency for interaction between density and strain, e.g., wild fish were relatively more aggressive at higher densities. Food ration had no effect on level of agonistic behavior. These results indicate that the selection for rapid growth in hatcheries may indirectly select for reduced aggressiveness. Genetic integrity and diversity of wild populations may be threatened when interbreeding occurs between wild and hatchery fish. Aggr. Behav. 28:145–153, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The beliefs and feelings that comprise attitudes toward guns may well be important moderators of numerous social behaviors. For this reason, a three-dimensional attitudes scale was constructed. The first factor consists of an abstract set of beliefs concerning the right of the American public to own or not own guns. The second and third factors tap more concrete beliefs about the consequences of gun ownership. Specifically, the second factor assesses the degree to which people believe gun ownership affords protection against crime. The third factor measures the degree to which people believe guns stimulate crime. Discriminant validity of the subscales is shown by the pattern of correlations obtained with the three dimensions and various other social and personality measures. Regression analyses indicate that the subscales are uniquely predicted by different social variables. Discussion centers on the usefulness of such a measure for future research on aggression, social policy, and attitude change.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates a prominent functional explanation for play aggression, the practice hypothesis, employing data from a non-Western culture, the Zapotec of Oaxaca, Mexico. The practice hypothesis proposes that play aggression, sometimes called rough-and-tumble play, has evolved primarily as a \"safe\" way for young individuals to practice and perfect adult fighting and/or hunting skills. Ethological observations of 3–8-year-old Zapotec children (n = 48) form the basis for investigating serious and play aggression, and for evaluating predictions stemming from the practice hypothesis. Play aggression in Zapotec children is superficially similar to real aggression, but can be differentiated from aggression in a number of ways, such as by facial expression, nature of outcomes, and amount of behavioral variability. Rates of play aggression were not significantly different between Zapotec boys and girls; however, mixed-sex dyads during play aggression occurred less often than same-sex dyads. Play partners were closer in age than chance would predict, with initiators tending to be slightly older than recipients, except when boys initiated play aggression toward girls. Injuries during play aggression occurred very infrequently (in about 1% of the episodes), and children were more likely to stay together following play than following serious aggression. The Zapotec data are discussed in relation to predictions regarding play partner choice, sex differences, the overall nature (design) of play aggression (in relation to Zapotec adult aggression), as well as in relation to phylogenetic and cross-cultural considerations. It is concluded that most of the findings are consistent with the practice hypothesis. It is also suggested that because play and serious aggression can be distinguished and apparently stem from different underlying motivations, these behavioral patterns not be confounded as is sometimes done in observational studies of children's aggression.",

Filicide followed by the offender's suicide is less frequent still. The contexts and circumstances surrounding filicide-suicide may nevertheless provide insight into parental psychology.

Five hypotheses are tested for this study, using a database that includes incident-level information on over 22,000 homicides committed in Chicago during the years 1965–1994. Findings do not support the hypothesis of differential risk of suicide following filicide by genetic parents and stepparents. Previous work is replicated, indicating that: (1) filicides that include multiple victims are more likely to end in the offender's suicide than are filicides that include a single victim, (2) parents are more likely to commit suicide following a filicide of an older child than a filicide of a younger child, (3) older parents, relative to younger parents, are more likely to commit suicide following filicide, and that (4) fathers, relative to mothers, are more likely to commit suicide following filicide. Discussion suggests future directions for research that can inform our understanding of filicide and of filicide-suicide. Aggr. Behav. 00:000–000, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Self-, peer-, and teacher-reported data were collected from 2003 young adolescents from a variety of ethnic backgrounds (Black, Latino, Asian, White) during the fall of their sixth grade year to test the hypothesis that adolescents' hostile response selections mediate the association between their normative beliefs and aggressive reputations among their peers and teachers. Structural equation modeling analyses supported our hypothesis, and the model was found to be consistent across both gender and ethnicity. The results suggest that even though gender and ethnic differences in average levels of aggressive cognitions and behavior exist, the general process linking cognitions and behaviors is the same for all young adolescents.

The methodology was found to be feasible at this age; and useful in terms of differing views of participants and nonparticipants. There was evidence for increased insight from participants, who used more criteria to make their judgments, and more informative criteria such as knowledge of the rules of a game being played. Participant knowledge was most evident at the immediate viewings, but was partially retained one week later. Participants (more than nonparticipants) mostly described play fighting as friendly, and not involving hurt or showing off.

    "abstract": "Abstract A considerable body of research has accumulated regarding aggression toward health care staff, yet little is known about the contextual factors involved. The present study examined the context within which aggressive incidents occurred and the dynamics of the interaction between staff and patients. Two aspects in particular were investigated; firstly, whether incidents were preceded by some anxiety provoking stimulus and secondly, the assailants' levels of cognitive processing apparent at the time of the incident. A prospective study collected data concerning incidents of physical assault and threatening behaviour in a general hospital. Staff were interviewed soon after the incident occurred. A content analysis determined that 82.8% of incidents involved experiences delivered by the staff victims likely to have provoked anxiety in the assailant. Most commonly, incidents involved staff intervening in the patient's intended behaviour. In addition, in 64% of cases, assailants were actually displaying some impairment in cognitive processing at the time of the incident Data suggest that many patients may not have been fully aware of their situation and might have experienced some difficulty in comprehending the staff member's actions. Patients who do not appear to understand what is happening may require additional time and effort to ensure they comprehend fully and accept what the staff member is intending to do, particularly if patients are experiencing an event likely to increase anxiety levels.

    "abstract": "Analysis of the body targets attacked and defended during play-fighting by juvenile Djungarian hamsters Phodopus campbelli revealed that about 70% of all attacks were directed at the mouth. If successfully contacted, the mouth was briefly licked and nuzzled. The remaining playful attacks were gentle bites directed at the rump, and to a lesser extent, the top of the head. During serious fighting the top of the head and the rump are targets of attack, whereas the mouth is not. Licking and nuzzling the mouth was found to be a behavior performed by adult males at the beginning of sexual encounters. Therefore, play-fighting in juvenile hamsters cannot be thought of merely as a form of \"mock fighting\" since the principal target is seemingly sexual, not agonistic. The data also show that of the sexual body targets contacted, adult females are more likely to defend the mouth. In this way it is suggested that targets attacked and defended during juvenile play-fighting are derived from adult contexts in which such targets are defended. This hypothesis accounts for the prevalence of agonistic targets in the play-fighting of many species, and may provide a rationale for classifying those amicable targets that are competed for during play-fighting.",

Participants were 159 heterosexual men who completed measures of sexual prejudice and state negative affect. Participants were randomly assigned to view a short video depicting either a male–male or male–female sexual interaction and, following the video, again reported state negative affect. Anger network activation was then assessed via response latencies from a lexical decision task that required participants to identify emotion or emotionally neutral words from non-words. Results indicated that the pattern of covariation between sexual prejudice and anger facilitation was significantly more positive when participants viewed male–male erotica relative to male–female erotica. Increases in negative affect, particularly anxiety/fear, were found to mediate this association. These findings suggest that increases in negative affect following exposure to homosexuality may be the emotional trigger for biases in the processing of anger-related information and represent the cognitive underpinnings of sexually prejudiced aggression toward gay men.

After being provoked or not provoked by a high or low status experimenter, half the 160 male college student participants were led to believe that their evaluation of the experimenter would determine the experimenter's grade for conducting the research, and half were not given any reason to expect an opportunity to evaluate him. Then each man indicated his degree of interest in seeing each of twelve video selections that had been described in brief paragraphs, three each in four content categories: aggressive, humorous, mildly erotic, and neutral. In confirmation of the first hypothesis, provoked subjects who did not anticipate opportunity to retaliate expressed less interest in seeing aggressive material than did those not provoked. In relationship to the second hypothesis, provoked subjects showed the greatest interest in aggressive video material when they anticipated an opportunity to retaliate against a low status provocateur, but their interest was not greater than corresponding nonangered subjects. The effect of provocation upon interest in the other categories of video material was generally in line with what would be predicted from the theory. When there was no anticipated opportunity to retaliate, interest in humorous material was greater in provoked subjects than in those not provoked. In the case of the mildly erotic category of video selections, there was less interest expressed among provoked subjects when they anticipated having a chance to retaliate against a low status experimenter.",

Method : One hundred and sixty‐two officers (100 men and 62 women) completed a general measure of their attitudes towards prisoners and one designed to assess Attitudes towards Prisoners who Self‐Harm (APSH). Participants rated their perceptions of two adult male prisoners depicted in vignettes. The vignettes depicted identical types of self‐harm but varied the behavioral characteristics of the prisoners involved, with one depicted as “well‐behaved” and the other as “disruptive”. Results : Women were more likely than men to report positive attitudes towards self‐harm and in particular were less likely than men to endorse negative myths regarding self‐harm. The prisoner depicted as “disruptive” invoked increased negative attitudes than the “well‐behaved” prisoner. This finding was consistent across sex. Conclusion : The current study indicates that APSH are comprised of a number of components that were influenced by the sex of the participant and the behavioral characteristics of the prisoners depicted. The implications of these findings to practice are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 33:63–72, 2007. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Free testosterone levels assessed from saliva were higher among A subjects than among NA subjects (P <.05) with no significant changes related to time and progressive intoxication.

No research to date has focused on prison‐based behavioural characteristics. The present study aimed to explore these characteristics in a sample of young and juvenile male offenders. Subsidiary aims included examining the nature and extent of behaviours indicative of bullying, and the extent to which a developmental model of aggression can be applied to a prison sample. One hundred and thirty‐three offenders (102 young and 31 juvenile) completed a behavioural measure of behaviours indicative of bullying (Direct and Indirect Prisoner Behaviour Checklist). Juvenile offenders were more likely to report “being bullied” physically than young offenders and were less likely to report “bullying others” overall, directly and psychologically/verbally. Young offenders were more likely to be classified as “bully/victims” than juveniles. Prison‐based behavioural characteristics were more predictive of membership to the perpetrator and/or victim groups than personal descriptive characteristics such as age, sentence length, offence type, ethnic origin and total amount of time spent in prison. Bully/victims were predicted by increased negative and drug‐related behaviour and pure victims by decreased positive behaviour. There were no significant predictors for pure bullies. Bully/victims were found to react more aggressively to their victimization than pure victims. The present findings suggest that there are reliable predictors of involvement as a perpetrator and/or victim among young and juvenile samples.

A series of multiple regressions found that 17% of the variance associated with level of victim injury was accounted for by a model that included the three‐factor model of the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version [Forth, Kosson, and Hare, 2003], criminal versatility, and age of onset of criminal offending. Notably, anger and DSM‐IV symptoms of conduct disorder were not related to level of victim injury. The results of this study support an escalation hypothesis where individuals with earlier onset to criminal behavior and greater criminal versatility escalate to more severe violence.

Selective lesions of the raphe nuclei have been investigated in order to determine whether the various components of the 5 HT system exert some specific control over this aggressive behavior. Electrolytic lesions of the dorsal or the median raphe nucleus do not induce mouse killing, whereas combined lesions of these nuclei elicit this behavior in about 40% of naive rats. Consequently, it appears that serotonergic neurons originating in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei work synergistically in mediating inhibitory control over mouse-killing behavior. Loco-motor activity is increased in novel environments by each of the selective lesions and to a larger extent by combined raphe lesions; 24 hours activity in resting conditions is unchanged during the light period, and increased during the dark period of the daily cycle by the various lesions. As it has been shown previously that hyper-activity in response to novelty following raphe lesions is not directly related to the 5 HT decrease in the brain, it appears that interspecific aggression and motor responsiveness must not be dependent on the same neural substrate within the raphe nuclei. The raphe lesions do not facilitate the elicitation of mouse killing by further olfactory bulb ablations, in contrast to earlier results where bulbectomy facilitated the induction of this behavior by raphe lesions.",

One hundred and sixty adolescents were shown one of the two videos involving relational aggression and completed a questionnaire that assessed their perceptions of the aggression.

Presence or absence of young did not determine the occurrence of maternal aggression, whereas attacks on the young by the intruder decreased maternal aggression and increased cannibalism of pups by the dams. Apparently, if the function of maternal aggression in mice is protection of the young, such protection occurs because the pups are in a place where attacks are likely to occur and not because the dam \"defends\" the young.",

    "abstract": "Long-haired rats, Rattus villosissimus, were studied in large cages. Groups of adult rats (each of 3 males, or 1 male and 2 females) were observed during intermittent encounters with a male intruder for up to 9 days. Two further groups, each of 8 males and 8 females, were maintained for 70 days without introduction of intruders. Controls were kept in small cages in which intolerant behavior was rare. Behavior during attack resembled that of male R. norvegicus, but social relationships were less stable. Only observations on males are described in detail. Some rats collapsed under attack, though unwounded, and died when not removed. Collapse occurred sometimes after a few hours, but sometimes after many days of exposure. Exposure to attack was accompanied by a decline in body weight and by some adrenal hypertrophy. Two kinds of renal pathology are described: focal glomerular hypercellularity (FGH), probably due to glomerulonephritis, and dilated distal convoluted tubules. Neither condition occurred in the controls. FGH occurred in 3 of 12 rats (25%) that remained apparently healthy during the 9 days of continuous exposure, in 21 of 23 intruders (91%) that were exposed to intermittent attack over 9 days or less without becoming debilitated, and in 8 of 11 such rats (73%) that collapsed. All rats examined from 70-day colonies had FGH, whether collapsed or not. Dilated tubules occurred in 6 of 32 intruders (19%) exposed to intermittent attack, and in 2 of 6 animals that collapsed during 70 days of exposure. Renal pathology, especially glomerulonephritis, was therefore a correlate of social intolerance; but there was no evidence that it was a significant cause of death.",

The study, conducted in Israel, included 904 children from 13 schools. In each school, one age level was selected and divided randomly into three experimental conditions: psychoeducational class intervention, small group counseling, and control. In all classrooms, the highly aggressive children were identified a priori ( n =166). Analyses were conducted separately for the aggressive children and their nonaggressive classmates, in a nested procedure (mixed models). Results showed similar positive outcomes on all variables in both treatment groups, and higher compared with the control group. The discussion focuses on the strengths of each type of intervention.

Following a lesion of the midbrain attack site, attack previously elicited from hypothalamic electrodes ipsilateral to the lesion was eliminated or significantly reduced in frequency. The attack elicited from electrodes in the hypothalamus contralateral to the lesion was unaffected. Midbrain lesions made at sites from which attack was never elicited had no effect on hypothalamically elicited attack. The midbrain lesion in some cases eliminated only certain components of the total attack pattern; for example, the approach of a cat to the rat frequently remained present while the bite was absent. Additionally, it was found that the attack elicited from rostral hypothalamic electrodes was disrupted to a greater degree by a single midbrain lesion than the attack elicited from more caudal hypothalamic electrodes. These finding are discussed in terms of the neural system mediating this form of aggressive behavior in cats.",

Such findings have provided strong evidence against the catharsis view of aggressive fantasy. However, little attention has been paid to the potentially nuanced nature of the link between fantasy aggression and actual aggression. In the present article, we examined the influence of four variables in the aggressive fantasy-aggressive behavior link: gender, exposure to violence, fantasy absorption, and level of fantasy about harm befalling loved ones and the self (dysphoric fantasy). Using data from a diverse, community-based sample of 7-14-year olds and their mothers, we replicated the general finding that aggressive fantasy is positively associated with real-world aggressive behavior. However, we also found that the interaction of aggressive fantasy and exposure to violence related significantly to aggression, as did the relation between aggressive fantasy and dysphoric fantasy. When exposure to violence was low, even high levels of aggressive fantasizing did not predict aggressive behavior, and, when aggressive fantasizing was low, even high levels of exposure to violence did not predict aggressive behavior. Similarly, when dysphoric fantasy was high, the connection between fantasy aggression and real aggression was markedly attenuated. The implications of these findings for intervention efforts and future research are considered.",

A major subtype of political aggression is that associated with religious differences—or Religio‐Political Aggression (RPA). Little previous research has explored demographic or psychological factors that might distinguish supporters from non‐supporters of RPA. In an exploratory study, we investigated whether factors previously associated with aggression might correlate with support for RPA in the case of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. During the second intifada , fifty‐two 14‐year‐old Palestinian boys in Gaza completed self‐report measures of life events, emotional status, and political attitudes. Teenaged boys who reported family members having been wounded or killed by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) expressed greater support for RPA ( t (50)=−2.30, P =.026). In addition, boys who felt their group was treated unjustly reported greater support for RPA compared with those who did not ( t (50)=−2.273, P =.027).

A sample of 149 young men with offences of violence that were alcohol related was interviewed. Cases were classified and detailed information from the first ten cases in each class ( N =30) was subjected to thematic analysis. Intoxicated violence in pursuit of nonsocial profit‐based goals was opportunistic and motivated by the desire for more alcohol or drugs. Violence, in these cases, although serious, appeared to be brief. Intoxicated violence in pursuit of social dominance goals was typically precipitated by past or current insult or injury, and was accompanied by strong anger and an adrenaline rush. Attacks were ferocious, and robbing the victim was not uncommon, perhaps to inflict additional humiliation. Feelings of pride and satisfaction were typical and expressions of remorse were uncommon. Regarding intoxicated violence as defence in response to threat, attacks were often expected, and in some cases the respondent made a pre‐emptive strike. Weapon use was common in this group. Fear was experienced, but so too was anger. Feelings of excitement were not reported and remorse was common. Further validation of these types is warranted, and the potential implications of these findings for prevention and treatment are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 36:67–79, 2010. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

In this study, male participants were randomly selected from public houses (i.e., “pubs”) and asked to imagine themselves in a hypothetical intimate encounter in which the female in the scenario stops consenting to sexual contact. Participants were given the option to continue making sexual advances up to and including sexual intercourse against the woman's will. It was hypothesized based on Alcohol Myopia Theory that participant blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels would be associated with hypothetical sexual aggression when stereotypical cues of a woman's sexual availability (revealing clothing and alcohol use) were present in the scenario. Men's engagement in hypothetical sexual aggression was associated with BAC levels, but only when the woman was wearing revealing clothing. The sobriety of the female actor was not associated with sexual aggression. Results indicate that Alcohol Myopia Theory generalizes to a field setting.

Nested regression models with robust cluster standard errors demonstrated that the association between children's number of relationships and their levels of relational aggression was moderated by the number of relationships that their affiliates had. Children with more peer relationships (i.e., higher network centrality) exhibited higher levels of relational aggression, but only when these relationships were with peers who had fewer connections themselves (i.e., poorly connected peers). This finding remained significant even when controlling for common predictors of relational aggression including gender, overt aggression, prosocial behavior, victimization, social preference, and perceived popularity.

Levels of anger and social desirability were also examined for their relationship with aggression and offending motives. Results indicated that aggression motivation separated into four core motives; protection, social recognition, perceived positive outcome, and pleasure.

Research has shown that depleted participants behave more aggressively than non-depleted participants, especially after being provoked. Although exposure to nature (e.g., a walk in the park) has been predicted to replenish resources common to executive functioning and self-control, the extent to which exposure to nature may counteract the depletion effect on aggression has yet to be determined. The present study investigated the effects of exposure to nature on aggression following depletion. Aggression was measured by the intensity of noise blasts participants delivered to an ostensible opponent in a competition reaction-time task. As predicted, an interaction occurred between depletion and environmental manipulations for provoked aggression. Specifically, depleted participants behaved more aggressively in response to provocation than non-depleted participants in the urban condition. However, provoked aggression did not differ between depleted and non-depleted participants in the natural condition. Moreover, within the depletion condition, participants in the natural condition had lower levels of provoked aggression than participants in the urban condition. This study suggests that a brief period of nature exposure may restore self-control and help depleted people regain control over aggressive urges.",

    "abstract": "A substantial body of literature has documented the negative effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) on a wide range of children's developmental outcomes. However, whether a child's exposure to IPV leads to increased adjustment difficulties is likely to depend on a variety of factors, including the caregiver's mental health and the developmental time period when IPV exposure occurs. The present study seeks to improve our understanding of the long-term effects of IPV exposure and maternal depression on the development of children's overt aggressive behavior. Longitudinal analyses (i.e., latent growth curve modeling) examining three time points (toddler: age 2-3 years, preschool/kindergarten: age 4-5 years, and elementary school: age 6-8 years) were conducted using 1,399 at-risk children drawn from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW-I). IPV exposure during age 2-3 years was significantly related to concurrent aggressive behavior and aggressive behavior during age 4-5 years. At all three time points, IPV was significantly associated with maternal depression, which in turn, was significantly related to higher levels of aggressive behavior. There was also a significant indirect lagged effect of IPV exposure at age 2-3 years through maternal depression on aggressive behavior at age 4-5 years. Results indicated that maternal depression was a strong predictor of increased reports of overt aggressive behavior, suggesting that interventions to buffer the effects of IPV exposure should focus on relieving maternal depression and fostering productive social behavior in children.

    "abstract": "Animals adopt different behavioral strategies to cope with the conflict of interests coming from the competition over limited resources. Starting from the study on chimpanzees, post‐conflict third‐party affiliation (the affiliative contact provided by a third‐party toward the victim—VTA—or the aggressor—ATA) was investigated mainly in primates. Later, this post‐conflict mechanism has been demonstrated also in other mammals, such as wallabies, horses, dolphins, domestic dogs, and wolves. Here, we present data on triadic post‐conflict affiliation in wolves ( Canis lupus lupus ) by exploring some of the hypotheses already proposed for primates and never tested before in other social mammals. In this carnivore species, the study of VTA and ATA revealed that these strategies cannot be considered as a unique behavioral category since they differ in many functional aspects. VTA serves to protect the victim by reducing the likelihood of reiterated attacks from the previous aggressor and to reinforce the relationship shared by the third‐party and the victim. On the other hand, ATA has a role in bystander protection by limiting the renewed attacks of the previous aggressor toward uninvolved group‐members (potential third‐parties). In conclusion, exploring VTA and ATA gives the opportunity to concurrently demonstrate some functional differences in triadic post‐conflict affiliation according to the different targets of bystanders (victims or aggressors). The data comparison between primates and other social mammals should permit to open new lines of research. Aggr. Behav. 41:526–536, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "In research on aggression, implicit association tests (IATs) have been constructed to elucidate automatic processes involved in aggressiveness. Despite an increasing number of applications of the \"Aggressiveness-IAT\" in basic and applied research, the psychometric properties of this method for measuring an automatic aggressive self-concept have not been comprehensively investigated. Although the Aggressiveness-IAT has been used both as a cross-situationally consistent trait measure and as a measure to indicate situational changes, prior studies have not tested to what extent it reliably captures a stable trait vs. an occasion-specific aggressive self-concept. The present research scrutinizes the psychometric properties of the Aggressiveness-IAT by addressing two issues. First, we tested the reliability, consistency, and occasion specificity of the Aggressiveness-IAT in a longitudinal panel study with four waves and 574 Austrian school children/adolescents by applying latent-state trait (LST) theory. Second, we validated latent trait scores of the IAT vis-à-vis other measures either clearly related to aggression or not. Results demonstrate that 20-30% of the variance in children's and adolescents' IAT scores is situation-unspecific (i.e., \"stable\"), whereas 36-50% are situation-specific. Regarding its construct validity, the Aggressiveness-IAT is correlated with explicit measures of aggression and related constructs, but it is not associated with discriminant variables (e.g., school achievement). Implications for using the Aggressiveness-IAT are discussed in the light of these findings. Aggr. Behav. 41:84-95 2015. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

It is considered part of the suspicious mindset that may cause highly victim‐justice sensitive individuals to behave uncooperatively. Thus, links of victim justice sensitivity (JS) with negative behavior, such as aggression, may be better explained by HAB. The present study tested this hypothesis in N = 279 German adolescents who rated their JS, HAB, and physical, relational, verbal, reactive, and proactive aggression. Victim JS predicted physical, relational, verbal, reactive, and proactive aggression when HAB was controlled. HAB only predicted physical and proactive aggression. There were no moderator effects. Injustice seems an important reason for aggression irrespective of whether or not it is intentionally caused, particularly among those high in victim JS. Thus, victim JS should be considered as a potential important risk factor for aggression and receive more attention by research on aggression and preventive efforts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Evidence suggests that both men and women perpetrate sexual coercion. Psychological factors, including psychopathic traits and power motivations, have been proposed to characterize male‐perpetrated sexual coercion; however, it is unclear whether these factors play a similar role in female‐perpetrated coercion or whether other motivations (e.g., intimacy, affect regulation) should be considered. To improve our understanding in this area, the current study first examined relationships between psychopathic traits and sexual coercion in a sample of 1199 undergraduate students (756 women), with gender as a potential moderator of these relationships. Second, the role of motivations for sex (e.g., power, affect regulation) in accounting for the psychopathy‐coercion relationship was examined in men and women. Data were collected using an online survey and analyzed using multigroup path analysis. Results implicated impulsive‐antisocial traits as particularly important to male‐perpetrated verbal (e.g., manipulative) and nonverbal (e.g., physical) coercion, and that this relationship was partially explained by motives for sex involving power. In contrast, psychopathic traits did not appear to play a major role in female perpetrated coercion; instead, emotional value (i.e., intimacy‐related) motivations for sex were associated with verbal (e.g., manipulation) coercion in women. In sum, our results support a conceptual model of male perpetration where men who are high in impulsive‐antisocial traits may engage in sexual coercion in an attempt to feel powerful. Further, the findings in the female sample suggest that factors other than psychopathy, such as gender role beliefs in regard to sexual encounters, may be particularly important to female perpetrated sexually coercive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Aggression is closely related to impulsive behavior both in humans and in animals. To avoid potential negative consequences, aggressive behavior is kept in control by strong inhibitory mechanisms. Failure of these inhibitory mechanisms results in violent behavior. In the present experiments, we investigated whether aggressive behavior is related to impulsive behavior. Furthermore, we investigated if violent behavior can be distinguished from “normal” aggressive behavior in terms of impulsivity levels. We used rats of the wild‐type Groningen strain, rats of this strain differ widely in their level of offensive aggression expressed toward an unfamiliar intruder male, ranging from no aggression at all to very high levels of intense and sometimes violent behavior. Violent behavior was displayed by some of the animals that were given repeated winning experience. We used behavioral performance in an unpredictable operant conditioning paradigm for food reinforcement (variable interval 15) and performance in a differential‐reinforcement of low rate (DRL‐60s) responding as determinants for impulsivity. We predicted that offensive aggression is correlated with behavioral flexibility measured by the VI‐15 procedure and that aggressive behavior is characterized by low behavioral inhibition on the DRL task. In addition we expected that violent animals would be characterized by extremely low levels of behavioral inhibition on the DRL task. We showed that the level of offensive aggression indeed positively correlated with VI‐15 performance. In addition, we showed that behavioral performance on the DRL procedure is similar in low and high aggressive rats. However, violent animals can be dissociated by a lower efficiency of lever pressing on a DRL‐60s schedule of reinforcement. Aggr. Behav. 40:300–308, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Using data from a longitudinal study of pregnant adolescents and partners ( n = 291 couples), we used a multivariate profile analysis using multivariate analysis of covariance with between and within‐subjects effects to compare IPV groups and sex on relationship and psychological factors. Analyses were conducted at the couple level, with IPV groups as a between‐subjects couple level variable and sex as a within‐subjects variable that allowed us to model and compare the outcomes of both partners while controlling for the correlated nature of the data. Analyses controlled for age, race, income, relationship duration, and gestational age. Among couples, 64% had no IPV; 23% male IPV victim only; 7% mutual IPV; 5% female IPV victim only. Relationship ( F = 3.61, P &lt; .001) and psychological ( F = 3.17, P &lt; .001) factors differed by IPV group, overall. Attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, relationship equity, perceived partner infidelity, depression, stress, and hostility each differed by IPV profile (all P &lt; .01). Attachment anxiety, equity, depression and stress had a significant IPV profile by sex interaction (all P &lt; .05). Couples with mutual IPV had the least healthy relationship and psychological characteristics; couples with no IPV had the healthiest characteristics. Females in mutually violent relationships were at particularly high risk. Couple‐level interventions focused on relational issues might protect young families from developing IPV behaviors. Aggr.

ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptom counts were assessed based on parent- and teacher-reports; parents rated children's social problems and teachers rated children's use of physical and relational aggression and experiences of physical and relational victimization. A multiple mediator model was used to test whether there were indirect effects of ADHD or ODD symptoms on physical and relational victimization through social problems, physical aggression, or relational aggression. At the bivariate level, ADHD and ODD symptoms were both significantly associated with higher rates of physical and relational victimization. In the mediational model, there were significant indirect effects of ADHD symptoms on relational victimization via social problems, of ODD on relational victimization via relational aggression, and of ODD symptoms on physical victimization via physical aggression. Results suggest that there are distinct risk factors implicated in the physical and relational victimization of youth with ADHD and that the co-occurrence of ODD symptoms is important to assess.

    "abstract": "Research has consistently supported autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning as a predictor of aggressive behavior in youth. Several studies have further examined how the functioning of the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) branches of the ANS interact with environmental factors to predict behavioral outcomes. One factor that has yet to be studied in this context however, is parenting practices. Given that many interventions for externalizing behavior target parenting practices, such as increasing consistent discipline, it may be particularly important to assess whether parenting practices interact with SNS and PNS functioning in the child to influence risk for aggressive behavior. Therefore, the current study addressed this question by examining inconsistent discipline as a moderator of the relationship between baseline SNS versus PNS activity and reactive versus proactive aggression. Data were collected from a sample of fourth graders identified as at‐risk for aggression ( N = 188). Results indicated that baseline SNS activity was positively related to proactive aggression under high levels of inconsistent discipline, but negatively related to proactive aggression under very low levels of inconsistent discipline. Baseline PNS activity was negatively associated with reactive aggression under low levels of inconsistent discipline. No main effects were found for SNS or PNS functioning and either form of aggression, emphasizing the importance of taking a biosocial approach to examining the predictors of aggressive behavior in at‐risk youth. Results from this study help to better understand the circumstances under which children are most likely to exhibit reactive versus proactive aggression, better informing targeted prevention and treatment.",

Researchers are interested in looking for protective factors within the GAM to diminish aggression. Previous studies have found two relevant variables acting independently as risk and protective factors: emotional intelligence (EI) and negative affect (NA). The aim of the present study is to analyze a moderated mediation model including these variables as an explanation of aggressive behavior and integrate it within the GAM. Four hundred and six participants were assessed on EI, NA, and aggression. The moderated mediation analysis showed a significant negative indirect effect of the perceiving EI branch on total aggression mediated through NA levels, which, in turn, was moderated by the managing EI branch. Moreover, this relationship was also observed for the physical, anger, and hostility sub‐scales of aggression. Our study demonstrates the importance of having a high ability to perceive emotions as a protective factor in the first stage of the GAM. These individuals will present lower NA in the second stage of the model, resulting in a reduction in aggression. Moreover, having a high ability to perceive emotions is particularly relevant for individuals that are less able to manage emotions, given that those participants with higher scores on the managing EI branch can reduce their aggressive behavior by mitigating the effect of NA on aggression in the third stage of the GAM.",

Understanding how fluctuations in ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle may contribute to symptom instability is key for accurate assessment of BPD symptoms and effective interventions. Reactive and proactive aggression, as well as anger‐in and anger‐out, were assessed daily in 15 physically healthy, unmedicated naturally cycling female individuals meeting criteria for BPD across 35 days. Urine luteinizing hormone surge and salivary progesterone were used to confirm ovulation and verify the cycle phase. Multilevel models evaluated cyclical differences of symptoms between cycle phases. Both forms of aggressive behavior demonstrated marked cycle effects, with reactive aggression highest during the midluteal cycle phase, co‐occurring with initial increases in anger and irritability and followed by perimenstrual peaks in anger and anger‐in. In contrast, highest levels of proactive aggression were observed during the follicular and ovulatory phases, when emotional symptoms and anger were otherwise at lowest levels. These findings highlight the importance of identifying the function of aggression when considering potential psychological and biological influences. Naturally cycling individuals with BPD may be at elevated risk for luteal worsening of a range of interpersonally reactive symptoms, including reactive aggression, whereas proactive aggression may occur more in phases characterized by less emotional and cognitive vulnerability and greater reward sensitivity. Research on aggression in this population should consider cycle effects. Cycling individuals with BPD attempting to reduce aggressive behavior may benefit from cycle‐tracking to increase awareness of these effects and to develop appropriate strategies.",

Building on prior research, we hypothesized that individuals living in social environments known to be vulnerable (vs. less vulnerable) are more likely to experience a sense of significance loss (i.e., lack of social integration, perceived conflicts between religious groups), find solace in religious social networks (i.e., mosques), and thus adhere to radical narratives (i.e., legitimization of terrorism).

The proposed model fit the data well. SEM showed (a) an indirect effect from temperament to affective problems, via irritability and positive parenting; (b) a direct effect from negative affectivity to anxiety, plus an indirect effect from both temperament dimensions, via irritability and autonomy parenting practices; and (c) an indirect effect from temperament to oppositional problems, via irritability and punitive parenting.

Data from Wave 4 of the national, randomly selected, Growing up with Media cohort ( n = 876 adolescents aged 14‐19 years), collected in 2011, were analyzed. Dating youth perceived more peer pressure to have sex and were more accepting of sex in brief or nonmarital relationships than pre‐dating youth. Boys had higher levels of rape‐supportive attitudes than girls. Among dating youth, the relative odds of involvement in teen dating abuse as a perpetrator or a victim were generally associated with greater acceptance of relationship violence, perceived peer pressure to have sex, and acceptance of sex in brief and/or nonmarital relationships. Rape‐supportive attitudes were not significantly associated with any type of teen dating abuse involvement. Programs aimed at preventing dating abuse might benefit from targeting attitudes associated with sexual activity as well as relationship violence.",

The present study employed a modified competitive reaction time task to test the effects of shyness, violent (vs. nonviolent) gameplay, and shyness on individuals' positive-negative affect, hostile attributions, and aggressive behaviors. In addition, the present study also employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the mediation (by cognition and affect) and moderation (by shyness). Results showed that playing a VVG increased aggressive behaviors, negative affect, and hostile attributions primarily among shy participants. In addition, the results of SEM also revealed that this moderating role was mediated by negative affect and hostile attributions. The present study supported GAM and showed that individuals' aggressive behaviors are differentially susceptible to VVGs, depending on their level of shyness in a \"for bad and for worse\" manner.",

Hence, the current study aims to bridge this gap by examining whether there are differences between mothers' and fathers' parenting characteristics and their children's SIP patterns as well as their social functioning in school, with a specific focus on children's aggressive response evaluation and decision (RED) and social difficulties in kindergarten. Using a multimethod (self‐reports and direct assessments) multi‐informant (mother, father, child, and teacher) design, we collected data from 115 kindergarten children, their mothers, and their fathers, tapping the parents' perceptions of the relationships with the child and parenting style; the child's aggressively biased RED, and the child's social difficulties in kindergarten. We found that fathers' parenting capacities are associated with children's aggressively biased RED, whereas no such associations were found for mothers. In addition, aggressively biased RED mediated the association between fathers' authoritative parenting style and the child's maladaptive behavior in kindergarten. There were no differences between fathers and mothers in relation to social difficulties in kindergarten, with both parents' authoritative parenting style associated with less social difficulties. However, sex moderated this association in mothers as their authoritative style was associated with social difficulties in boys but not in girls. This difference was not found in fathers. On the other hand, fathers' authoritarian parenting style was associated with aggressive RED in boys but not in girls. The tentative nature of these findings and the need for replications are discussed.",

In addition, research shows that men under‐report their injuries yet may suffer grave consequences. It is, thus, vital to establish physical injury patterns in male IPV victims. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was performed using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System‐All Injury Program data from 2005 to 2015 for all IPV‐related injuries in both male and female patients. Sex differences by demographics, mechanism, anatomic location, and diagnoses of IPV injuries were analyzed using statistical methods accounting for the weighted stratified nature of the data. IPV accounted for 0.61% of all emergency department visits; 17.2% were in males and 82.8% in females. Male patients were older (36.1% vs. 16.8% over 60 years), more likely to be Black (40.5% vs. 28.8%), sustained more injuries due to cutting (28.1% vs. 3.5%), more lacerations (46.9% vs. 13.0%), more injuries to the upper extremity (25.8% vs. 14.1%), and fewer contusions/abrasions (30.1% vs. 49.0%), compared to female IPV patients ( p &lt; .0001). There were also more hospitalizations in men (7.9% vs. 3.7% p = .0002).

The expectation here is that targeting these mechanisms will result in within‐person changes in aggression. However, evidence for these mechanisms is mostly based on between‐person analyses. We, therefore, examined whether within‐person changes in adaptive anger regulation and hostile intent attribution covaried with within‐person changes in children's aggression. Children ( N = 223; age 7–12; 46% boys) filled out four weekly report measures to assess adaptive anger regulation, hostile intent attribution, and aggression. The psychometric properties of these novel measures were adequate. Results of multi‐level analyses revealed within‐person effects: weekly changes in adaptive anger regulation and hostile intent attribution covaried with changes in children's aggression. This corresponded with between‐person findings on the same data: children with lower levels of adaptive anger regulation and higher levels of hostile intent attribution reported more aggression than other children. These findings support the idea that targeting anger regulation and hostile intent attribution in interventions may lead to changes in individual children's aggression.",

Children ( N = 200; 45.5% girls) and teachers ( N = 8; 100% women) were recruited from three primary schools in the south‐east of England. Children were aged 5−7 years ( M = 75.6 months, SD = 10.39). Child and teacher reports of children's friendships were obtained. Children reported on the quality of their best friendship. Children provided peer reports on involvement in peer victimization (as aggressor, defender, and target) and social status (like‐most and like‐least). Results show that aggressive children received more like‐least nominations than other children, defenders were the most liked by peers, but targets' social status was not clearly identifiable. There were no significant differences between role in peer victimization and best friend nominations—most children said that they had a best friend. Similarly, there were no differences in reciprocated friendship between different roles. However, children who had their friendship reciprocated received more defender nominations. In line with the homophily hypothesis, aggressive children tended to have aggressive friends and have friendships characterized by conflict. Defenders were friends with other defenders. Targets tended to follow the social competence model of friendships by indicating defenders as their best friends. We discuss these findings in relation to the role that group processes may play in peer victimization in early childhood.",

Its risks have been frequently explored, and violence exposure in daily life has been regarded as an important risk factor of cyber‐aggression. However, the longitudinal association between violence exposure in daily life and cyber‐aggression has not yet been examined, and the mechanisms underlying the link between violence exposure and cyber‐aggression remain largely unclear. Based on the General Aggression Model and Script Theory, we explored the circular relation between violence exposure in daily life, hostile automatic thoughts, and cyber‐aggression. The current study adopted a longitudinal design to address these issues among 941 college students. The results indicated violence exposure in daily life predicted hostile automatic thoughts and cyber‐aggression 6 months later; hostile automatic thoughts predicted violence exposure and cyber‐aggression 6 months later; and cyber‐aggression predicted hostile automatic thoughts and violence exposure 6 months later. Moreover, each of them plays a mediating role in the association between the other two variables. These results support and expand the General Aggression Model and Script Theory that violence exposure, aggressive cognition, and aggression facilitate each other. This also provides theoretical guidance on reducing cyber‐aggression in daily life.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Little is known about the factors that facilitate the perpetration of sexual violence within the context of same‐sex romantic relationships (sexual intimate partner violence perpetration [S‐IPV]). The present study sought to identify the effects of external and internal minority stress and problematic drinking on perpetration of S‐IPV within a dyadic framework. A community‐based sample of 137 sexual and gender minority (SGM) couples ( N = 274; 59 male assigned at birth and 78 female assigned at birth couples) completed self‐report surveys about minority stressors, alcohol use, and S‐IPV perpetration. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted within an actor‐partner interdependence framework. This approach accounted for both actor effects (e.g., how much one's S‐IPV perpetration is predicted by their own risk factors) and partner effects (e.g., how much one's S‐IPV perpetration is influenced by their partner's risk factors). Both Actor external minority stress and internal minority stress were positively associated with Actor S‐IPV perpetration. Actor problematic drinking was not associated with Actor S‐IPV perpetration; however, Partner problematic drinking was positively associated with Actor S‐IPV perpetration. Observed effects were robust above the addition of other risk factors. This research innovatively extricates S‐IPV perpetration from other forms of IPV and indicates that Actor minority stress and Partner problematic drinking increase S‐IPV likelihood. Results serve as a starting point for development of etiological models to inform the design of culturally‐informed interventions to reduce S‐IPV among SGM couples.",

A lack of research on collective narcissism amongst non-Western contexts and minority groups remains a challenge for the field. However, here we test two types of collective narcissism (sectarian and national) as differential predictors of two dimensions of collective violence beliefs (against outgroup members and leaders) in a large, diverse, community sample from Lebanon (N = 778). We found that sectarian narcissism (narcissism related to smaller political and religious ingroup identity) predicted support for collective violence against members of different sects, while national narcissism predicted opposition to such collective violence. Neither form of collective narcissism had any significant relationship with collective violence against outgroup leaders. We controlled for both sectarian and national identification and found no significant effects in predicting either one of the two dimensions of collective violence beliefs. In this non-Western context, in which a coherent national identity is undermined by sectarianism, national narcissism seems to be a progressive motivator for unity and social change, while sectarian narcissism is rather associated with extreme attitudes, such as support for collective violence.",

We conducted a prospective longitudinal study across four waves of assessment for 1 year of individuals in romantic relationships in Japan. They completed measures of attachment anxiety, the Dark Triad, need for control, and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration at Wave 1, and measures of maladjusted reactions to breakups (i.e., anger and rumination) and stalking behaviors at a wave after breakups. The final sample consisted of 356 participants who were involved in romantic relationships at Wave 1 and left by their partners during the survey period. Correlational analysis showed that the Dark Triad at Wave 1 was significantly positively associated with future stalking behaviors, but attachment anxiety was not. Structural equation modeling showed that attachment anxiety and the Dark Triad increased future stalking behaviors after breakups through psychological IPV perpetration during relationships. Additionally, attachment anxiety increased future stalking behaviors through higher levels of postbreakup anger and rumination. Conversely, we did not find any indirect effects of the Dark Triad on stalking behaviors through these reactions toward breakups. Overall, these results suggest that it is necessary to consider personality traits that could damage intimate relationships and to focus on the quality of romantic relationships to prevent stalking after romantic breakups. These results also indicate that emotion regulation may be useful in preventing stalking caused by attachment anxiety.",

In Chinese culture, children's victimization may also be a precursor to parenting behaviors. Nevertheless, the reciprocal relationship between child maltreatment and children's bullying victimization remains unclear, particularly in Chinese culture. This study aimed to evaluate the reciprocal association between child maltreatment and children's bullying victimization in China, as well as its gender differences. A total of 891 children aged 8–11 years in China participated in the study at four time points. The potential reciprocal link was examined using a cross‐lagged model. The results indicated that physical abuse predicted children's bullying victimization across four time points, while physical neglect predicted children's bullying victimization during the first three time points. The effects of emotional abuse and neglect were negligible. Conversely, children's bullying victimization consistently predicted various types of parental maltreatment over time. Some gender differences in the relationship were found. The findings emphasized a reciprocal relationship between child maltreatment within the family and children's bullying victimization at school. Understanding the cyclical patterns between child maltreatment and bullying victimization may help improve family education approaches and reduce children's bullying victimization.",

Four organization context factors (a permissive climate, a masculinized job/gender context, male/female contact, and Masculinity Contest Culture [MCC] Norms) and four dark personality traits (psychopathy, narcissism, Machiavellianism, and sadism) were examined. While only one organizational context factor, MCC Norms correlated with men's admissions of sexually harassing behaviors at work, all four dark personality traits evidenced significant correlations. In a multiple regression analysis, MCC Norms emerged again as the single organizational context predictor and psychopathy as the single personality predictor of men's admissions of sexually harassing behaviors at work. Moderation analyses showed that a masculinized job/gender context interacted with psychopathy to produce more admissions of sexually harassing behaviors. Mediation analyses showed that psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism had indirect relationships with admissions of sexually harassing behaviors through MCC Norms. Higher levels on these traits were related to higher levels of these workplace norms which, in turn, predicted more admissions of sexually harassing behavior. This research sheds new light on how both organizational contexts and enduring personal characteristics of men are related to sexual harassment in the workplace.",

Valid and reliable measures of potential precursors to LEO excessive use of force, such as aggression, are needed. The Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire‐short form (BPAQ‐SF) is a validated measure of aggression across various populations; however, evaluation of this easily administered measure in high‐stress, frontline populations such as LEOs is limited. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change the BPAQ‐SF in a sample of LEOs. A confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the hierarchical solution provides a mixed fit to the data: SBχ² (25.84) = 62.50, p = .0001; comparative fit index = .94, non‐normed fit index = .92, root mean square error of approximation = .19 (90% confidence interval = .17–.21), standardized root mean squared residual = .08. The BPAQ‐SF demonstrated good internal consistency ( α = .84) and test–retest reliability ( r = .86), correlations in the expected direction with predictors of and buffers against aggression, and sensitivity to change among LEOs who participated in an intervention targeting aggression. Results support and extend previous findings suggesting that the BPAQ‐SF is a valid and reliable measure of aggression among LEOs.",

The aim of the current study was to develop reliable measures for both popularity motivations, and examine how both motivations are uniquely and jointly related to aggression. Participants were 1123 Dutch secondary school students (M age = 14.4 years, 48% girls), who completed a 3‐item measure of striving for high popularity based on existing questionnaires (Li &amp; Wright, 2014; Ojanen et al., 2005), and a 3‐item measure of avoiding low popularity consisting of an adapted version of the high popularity items. Aggressive behavior was measured through peer nominations. Motivations were moderately correlated ( r = .51), but did not always co‐occur within the same person, as 17% of the sample belonged to a cluster that scored low on striving for popularity, but moderately high on avoiding low popularity. When considered simultaneously, striving for high popularity was not related to any type of aggression, whereas avoiding affiliation with unpopular peers was related to strategic aggression. For physical and verbal aggression, gossiping, excluding and bullying, the association of avoiding low popularity with aggression was strongest when youth also strived for high popularity. Future work should take both popularity motivations into account to better understand, predict and intervene on youth's aggression toward peers.",

Most fantasies were elicited by frustrating or threatening interpersonal events and involved material-cultural weapons (e.g., firearms, knives, clubs) as opposed to organismic weapons (e.g., hands, feet). Material-cultural weapons were rated as easier to use and more lethal than organismic weapons, and participants reported higher self-efficacy beliefs for using material-cultural weapons. Most participants reported that they had been exposed to mass media models using their weapons of choice and that they had access to these weapons.

Aggressive children were evaluated as more disliked at each time of testing (i.e., Stable Aggressive and Discontinued Aggression at Time 1; Stable Aggressive and Became Aggressive at Time 2). Furthermore, sociometric ratings of children at Time 1 who became aggressive by Time 2 foreshadowed this transition. Children who discontinued aggressive behaviors were friends with children who were evaluated by peers as significantly less aggressive than the friends of children who continued aggressive behaviors. These findings suggest that early identification of children at risk for developing aggressive behavior may be possible through group-level peer evaluations, and identification of those at risk for continuing aggressive behavior may be possible through the evaluation of special dyadic friendships.

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of aggressive disposition on intoxicated and non-intoxicated aggressive behavior. Prior aggressiveness was measured with a structured questionnaire. Based on a bipartite split of scores, 28 subjects were assigned to the high aggressor group, and 29 to the low aggressor group. Subjects in both disposition groups were then randomly assigned to either a drunk or sober condition, and participated in a competitive reaction time task involving the administering and receiving of electric shocks to/from a fictitious opponent under conditions of high and low provocation. Aggression was defined as shock level intensity delivered to the sham opponent. When highly provoked, sober high aggressors were significantly more aggressive than low aggressors, thus validating the measure of aggressive disposition. When intoxicated, highly provoked individuals in both the high and low aggressive disposition groups attained equal levels of aggression. It was low aggressors who responded to escalated provocation with a significant increase in aggression responding when intoxicated. These results lend support to the notion that a pharmacological effect of alcohol can increase aggressive behaviour. Aggr. Behav. 23:11–18, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory rats, like many other animal species, transport food. Their behavior is influenced by factors such as food size, the time required to eat, travel distance, travel difficulty, and the availability of cover, etc. Recent versions of optimal foraging theory suggest that species that display such behavioral patterns do so in order to minimize risk to predation while at the same time maximizing food gain. Nevertheless, it is not clear that this explanation applies to rats, nor is it easy to investigate this problem in a laboratory. The results of the present study on urban feral rats show that their food handling behavior is similar to that of domestic rats. The results also suggest that food carrying can serve defensive as well as communicative functions. Aggression around food sources was high. Smaller rats always carried food and some large rats infrequently carried food, suggesting that the food carrying by smaller, subordinate rats may help them avoid conspecific aggression. The rats also vigorously attempted to steal food that was carried home by conspecifics. This result suggests that food carrying can redistribute food resources and inform conspecifics about food availability. The results demonstrate the utility of multilevel behavioral analysis and also demonstrate that for rats, food transport has functions other than predator avoidance, including avoidance of conspecific aggression and communication about food availability. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The play fighting behaviour of male rats (Rattus norvegicus) castrated at weaning was compared to that of intact controls during the juvenile and post-pubertal phases of development. Following puberty, both the castrated and intact animals exhibited an age-related change in their play fighting; the frequency of initiating play fighting decreased and juvenile patterns of playful defense were replaced by more adult-like patterns. As these changes occurred even in the absence of the pubertal surge of gonadal hormones, they were more likely to result from the organizational effects of gonadal hormones in the perinatal period than the activational effects of these hormones at puberty. Although the castrated animals exhibited the age-related changes in behaviour, they did not exhibit the asymmetries in play associated with dominance relationships. As demonstrated in previous studies, in pairs of intact rats, the animal that attacks the most and uses more juvenile defenses during play fighting and weighs the least is typically the subordinate. In the castrates, asymmetries in weight and playful defense are not related to play frequency, indicating the absence of a dominance relationship. Although the characteristic changes in male play fighting at puberty are independent of the activational effects of gonadal hormones, dominance relationships and their associated changes in play fighting are dependent on these hormones. Therefore, in the perinatal period gonadal hormones most likely organize the age-related changes in play behaviour, whereas post-pubertally gonadal hormones activate dominance relationships and thus, indirectly modify play fighting by affecting dominance-associated assymetries in behaviour. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Eight- and 11-year-olds evaluated two hypothetical target children in three scenarios which differed as to the intent of a provocative act (Accidental, Ambiguous, Hostile). In addition to grade and sex, relationship between targets was manipulated as a between-subjects variable with targets portrayed as either Best Friends Acquaintances, or Enemies. Children evaluated targets in terms of attributions of intentions, behavior response, affective state of targets, and mutual liking between targets. Results indicated that aggressor's intentions and victim's behavior response were evaluated as positive for the Accidental scenario and as negative for the Hostile scenario regardless of target relationship. When aggressor's intentions were unclear (e.g., Ambiguous), interactions between Best Friends and interactions between Acquaintances were evaluated as positive while interactions between Enemies were perceived as negative. Further, while all children predicted a negative response by the victim during the Hostile situation, younger children predicted the victim's response would be less negative than did older children. Children reported Best Friends and Acquaintances as liking each other more before the provocation situation started than after it occurred while liking between Enemies remained unchanged, thus indicating a belief that provocations may hurt a positive or neutral relationship. Targets were perceived to be in negative affective states during the Accidental and Ambiguous scenarios and the aggressor was perceived to be in a neutral affective state during the Hostile scenario.

Subjects were assigned to a violent or nonviolent group based on their criminal history. Subjects participated in sessions in which they were given three response options: (1) nonaggressive responding that earned money, (2) aggressive responding that ostensibly subtracted money from another fictitious person and was defined as aggressive since it resulted in the ostensible delivery of an aversive stimulus (subtraction of money) to another person, and (3) escape responding that protected the subject's earnings from periodic subtractions initiated by the fictitious other person. Results indicated that the violent female parolees emitted significantly more aggressive responses than subjects in the nonviolent group. This study provides additional external validity as well as evidence for convergent and discriminant validity for PSAP laboratory measurement of human aggressive responding and extends these findings to female parolees. Comparisons to previously published data with male parolees showed that gender differences were found among violent but not nonviolent parolees. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Israeli society is characterized by significant internal divisions. Two of the most salient of these divisions within the Jewish population relate to (1) religiosity (religious vs. secular Jews) and (2) ethnic origin (Eastern [Asian and North African] vs. Western [European and American]). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of these social divisions on aggressive behavior and victimization to aggression among Israeli children. Three types of aggressive behavior (physical, verbal, and indirect) were investigated by means of peer estimation. The sample (N = 630) was composed of three age groups (8‐, 11‐, and 15‐year‐olds). The findings indicate that in general, secular respondents scored higher on aggressive behavior and victimization than their religious counterparts, and respondents of Eastern origin scored higher than those of Israeli or Western origin. The effect of both religiosity and ethnic origin was stronger among girls than among boys. Ethnic origin had no effect on any of the boys’ measures but did affect these measures among girls. Among boys, religiosity affected verbal and indirect aggression and victimization. Among girls, indirect aggression and victimization, as well as victimization to physical aggression, were affected by religiosity. As to the effect of age, similar to previous studies, in all types of aggression and victimization, the 11‐year‐olds scored highest and the 15‐year‐olds scored lowest. Differences between the three types of aggression and victimization, as well as various interactions between the variables, are reported. The results are discussed within the wider context of the role of religiosity and ethnic origin in Israeli society. Aggr. Behav. 28:281–298, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Subjects were a total of 120 children, but complete follow-up data were available only in 47 cases. Their aggressive behaviors were peer rated, and problem-solving strategies were assessed in childhood subjects being 10 years on average, and 7 years later. Association between a development of social strategies and changes in aggressive behavior was studied with personality-oriented pattern analyses. The main finding was that a development of strategies predicted a stability or changes of aggressive behavior very well. Aggressive strategies, both in childhood and in adolescence, as well as a lack of constructive alternatives characterized permanently aggressive subjects. Turning from nonaggressive to aggressive behavior was also explained by aggressive problem-solving strategies, while a positive development, i.e., turning from childhood aggressive to adolescent nonaggressive behavior, was possible only if a person had never used aggressive strategies. Agreement between behavior and strategies was higher among girls. The findings supported a claim that intervention of aggressive behavior may be possible by modifying social strategies. Aggr.

Results of some scientific research in 1992 were more or less ignored. Some years later one of the Dutch Parents Associations took the initiative in discussing bullying at the national level. Using the previous research, the four Dutch Parents Associations then started working together, developing a National Protocol Against Bullying in Education and presenting this to the media, and to all primary and secondary schools, in 1995. In 1997, the Associations presented a Bullying Test, a computer program that gives pupils in the classroom the opportunity to answer questions about many aspects of bullying; afterward the teacher can easily get an overview and base policy and action on the findings. Nowadays, no school in the Netherlands is unaware of bullying as a real problem. The subject is discussed regularly in schools and in the media. The Associations are planning new incentives to help all parties involved reduce bullying and prevent it as far as is possible. Aggr. Behav. 26:125–134, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The prototypic NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) itself is a widely abused substance and is known to elevate levels of aggression in drug users. The present study was aimed at testing several drugs that share with PCP the ability to block NMDA receptor–associated channel. The resident-intruder procedure was used to assess drug effects on aggressive behavior in isolated male mice. Resident aggressive mice were administered NMDA channel blockers (PCP; 0.3–10 mg/kg), dizocilpine (MK-801; 0.01–0.3 mg/kg), memantine (1–30 mg/kg), and MRZ 2/579 (0.1–5.6 mg/kg). The competitive NMDA receptor antagonist DCPPene (0.1–5.6 mg/kg) was also tested as a compound representing an alternative approach to reduce activity of NMDA receptor complex. PCP, dizocilpine, and memantine inhibited expression of aggressive behaviors only at doses that produced ataxia. The novel channel blocker MRZ 2/579 also produced ataxia at the highest dose level but failed to affect aggressiveness. Reduction in aggression with a corresponding increase in sociability was observed after administration of D-CPPene. Overall, the present results suggest that NMDA receptor channel blockers do not exert selective effects on aggressive behavior. Aggr. Behav. 25:381–396, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In addition, participants selected the acts which should be under personal jurisdiction. Participants provided reasons (i.e., justifications) to support their evaluations. The judgment evidence suggests that the moral rules were considered the most important, the transgressions the most wrong, the violators the most deserving of punishment, and the acts the least acceptable when permitted by an authority. With regard to these same dimensions, conventional rules and violations were ranked second; whereas, the personal rules were ranked third. Offender status differences were obtained for importance ratings and for deservedness of punishment. Justifications for moral events reflected reasoning from both the moral (e.g., other's welfare) and conventional (e.g., social order) domains. Reasoning about conventions involved both conventional and personal concerns; whereas, justifications about personal issues focused on individual prerogatives.

Each community was invaded once a day, with each of these large intruders invading every community once during the experiment. Five days after the last large intruder invasion, novel intruder group males, approximately the same size as the average community member, individually invaded the same communities, all communities being invaded once during a single day of testing. These novel intruders were used to differentiate the effects of intruder size from those effects of being put into a novel environment. During each intrusion, the frequencies of dominance, submission, aggressive standoffs, and nonaggressive interactions between the intruder and members of the community were recorded. The large intruders on each day immediately and virtually completely dominated all encountered community members, and the large intruders were significantly more dominant than the novel, smaller-sized intruders. The size advantage of the large intruders overwhelmed prior residence in influencing dominance outcomes, even in these well established communities.",

Study I investigated whether the typical perspective-specific divergence in judgments about aggressive interactions (with actors evaluating their behavior as more reasonable and less inappropriate than recipients) varied in interpersonal and intergroup contexts. Additionalty, the possible mediating influence of lay epistemic motivation and subjective judgmental confidence was explored. Results indicated that the social context had an important impact on the evaluation of aggressive interactions: there was a lower dissent between actors and recipients in the intergroup than in the interpersonal condition. However, the direction of this pattern of data differed from what could be derived from theories of aggressive and intergroup behavior. Subjective confidence and lay epistemic motivation did not influence the inappropriatencess ratings. Study II tried to shed some further light on the context-specific evaluation of aggressive interaction by presenting episodes of different severity and by obtaining judgments on both actions as well as reactions. Results showed that-irrespective of severity-aggressive reactions were evaluated more negatively in intergroup contexts. It is proposed that this effect stemmed from context-specific differences in the application of the norm of reciprocity.",

In the present study, adult movie-goers attending commercial showings of a violent or non-violent movie responded to a questionnaire consisting of two scales of the Buss-Durkee aggression inventory, either before or after viewing the film. No sex differences in response were observed. The audience attending the violent film had significantly higher aggression scores than the audience attending the nonviolent film, both before and after viewing. Also, those attending the violent film showed a significant increase in aggression scores, while those at the non-violent film did not. The results demonstrate that audiences who attend violent films have an initially higher level of aggressivity which is heightened after exposure to the violent film. Thus, in order to achieve ecological validity in research on film violence, the characteristics of the audience normally exposed to such films must be taken into consideration. The results also provide support for the hypothesis that attendance at a violent film promotes aggressive tendencies.",

The genders appeared equally interested in maintaining the relationship with the unfaithful partner, preventing future infidelity, and attracting another partner. More men than women said they were uncertain about their partner's sexual fidelity. The results were interpreted as evidence that women are devalued more than men by an act of sexual infidelity, resulting in men's greater frustration with the partner's transgression but relative behavioral indifference to both the transgressing partner and rival.

    "abstract": "Neonatal male rats were either injected subcutaneously with testosterone propionate (TP) or oil vehicle. When weaned, each treated pup was paired with an untreated male sibling. The play fighting of TP-and oil-treated rats were compared at the juvenile phase (30–36 days), and in adulthood (84–90 days). In the juvenile phase, the rate of initiating playful attacks was significantly greater for TP-treated rats. Playful defense in response to such attacks did not differ between TP- and oil-treated rats. At the completion of the study, cortical thickness was measured for all the groups of rats. Oil treatment decreased overall cortical thickness relative to untreated pairmates, whereas TP treatment did not. Both oil and TP treatment abolished the asymmetry in hemispheric thickness, which was present in the untreated pairmates. The reversal of at least one of these injectioninduced changes in the cortex by TP provided independent evidence for the effectiveness of the TP treatment. As adults, neither the TP treatment nor the oil treatment influenced which pairmate became dominant. Dominance was judged by which pairmate initiated less playful attacks. Therefore, it is concluded that the early neonatal testosterone surge is not likely to be a factor in influencing the behaviors that lead to adult dominance. In contrast, play fighting is influenced by hormonal events in this early neonatal phase. It thus appears that play fighting and the aggressive systems subserving dominance relationships are differentially controlled. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Two studies compared judgments about aggressive components of jealous reactions to the partner and to the rival, specifically, emotional (anger), cognitive (blame), and behavioral components. The first study randomly assigned 172 young women and men to two questionnaires on jealous reactions to mild (flirting) and serious (cheating) transgressions. One questionnaire assessed standards for appropriate behavior and perceptions of how people usually react. The second questionnaire asked people to report how they had reacted or, if not experienced with a sexual transgression, how they would react. The second study asked 113 people to imagine a situation in which they knew their partner had been sexually unfaithful. There were three major findings that were interpreted in the context of courtship, a time when attention is focused on the qualities of one's potential long-term partner. First, the jealous individual's anger and blame were focused more on the partner than the rival. Second, mean anger and blame scores given the partner were well matched. In contrast, the rival received more anger and blame than deemed appropriate and considerably more anger than blame. These data suggest that, in the context of courtship, a rival is not simply a competitor. Third, men were more inclined to think about aggressive action against the rival but women were more emotionally and behaviorally reactive to the rival. The latter result implies that, in the context of competition for an established romantic partner, a rival is more salient for women than for men. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Working from an evolutionary psychological perspective, M. Wilson, M. Daly, and J. Scheib [1997. Feminism and Evolutionary Biology. New York: Chapman and Hull. p 431–465] hypothesized and found that reproductive‐aged females incur excess risk of rape‐murder (being raped and murdered) relative to nonreproductive‐aged females and that this excess risk cannot be attributed solely to the greater association of young women with violent, young men. The current research provides the first national‐level replication of these findings for the United States. I secured access to a national database of homicides occurring in the United States between 1976 and 1994 and selected for analysis cases in which a female was (1) raped and murdered by a male previously unknown to her or (2) murdered in the context of theft by a male previously unknown to her. Results replicate the work of Wilson et al. [1997] and document that (1) young men commit the majority of rape‐murders and theft‐murders; (2) young, reproductive‐aged women are overrepresented among the victims of rape‐murder but (3) are underrepresented among the victims of theft‐murder. Discussion acknowledges the uncertain generalizability of theoretical and empirical work on rape‐murder to rape not accompanied by murder and addresses two challenges to an evolutionary perspective on rape‐murder: (1) Why are nonreproductive‐aged females raped? and (2) Why are raped females subsequently murdered?

    "abstract": "A follow-up study was conducted on the aggressive and delinquent behavior of an original sample of 220 pupils of two age groups. The subjects were 7 and 9 years old in 1978 when they were interviewed for the first time. The present paper focuses on predictors of the subjects' aggressive and criminal behavior in adolescence and in young adulthood. Four different groups of variables were chosen as possible predictive factors: 1) parental aggression, punitivity, and attitudes of rejection toward the child, 2) previous acts of aggression by the subjects, 3) the viewing of violence on television during childhood, and 4) aggressive, indifferent, and delinquent behavior in adolescence. Physical aggression in adolescence and the number of arrests and traffic violations in young adulthood were used as dependent variables. The analyses established that for the male subjects, the best predictor of physical aggression in adolescence was previous aggression, whereas for the female subjects the best predictor of physical aggression in adolescence was previous viewing of violence on television. The number of arrests in young adulthood was best predicted for the male subjects on the basis of previous aggression and viewing of violence on television. The best predictors of the number of arrests in young adulthood for the female subjects were, apart from previous aggression and viewing of violence on television, also aggressive and delinquent behavior in adolescence as well as parental aggression, punitivity, and attitudes of rejection. The results emphasize the importance of the atmosphere of socialization in childhood and previous aggressive behavior as significant predictors of physical aggression in adolescence and criminal behavior in young adulthood. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Many studies report on a polygynous mating system with a social group territoriality in commensal populations of Mus musculus domesticus . However, little is known about the social organization of other Mus species living in outdoor conditions, such as the mound‐building mouse Mus spicilegus . Comparative studies between M. m. domesticus and M. spicilegus have already shown behavioral differences in female sexual preferences and paternal care. To study agonistic and sociable interactions and gain insight into the social organization and the mating system of M. spicilegus , the present study compared intraspecific dyadic encounters between unfamiliar adults in these two species. Results demonstrated less tolerance between females and between the sexes in M. spicilegus than in M. m. domesticus unfamiliar mice.

    "abstract": "Abstract The offspring‐defense hypothesis of maternal territoriality in solitary and semisocial mammals [Wolff JO and Peterson JA. 1998. Ethol Ecol Evol 10:227–239] was evaluated in another taxon using maternal and nonmaternal female red swamp crayfish ( Procambarus clarkii ), a freshwater decapod crustacean that shows pronounced shelter‐related maternal aggression. The maternal females were of three different categories: (1) ovigerous, (2) carrying primarily stage 1 offspring, or (3) tending offspring that were primarily stage 2. Each female was in residence in an individual aquarium containing only a gravel substrate for 24 hr prior to serial intrusions by male conspecifics. Virtually all of the residents, maternal and nonmaternal, excavated a depression (shelter) in the substrate prior to the first intrusion. The results showed that residents in each of the maternal categories won a significantly higher proportion of their encounters than did the nonmaternal residents, which showed only negligible defense and lost every encounter. However, there were no significant differences in encounter outcomes between the maternal resident categories. There was clear defense of the shelter by maternal females, with virtually all fighting being in or around it, thus demonstrating stable, heightened territorial defense throughout these maternal phases of reproduction. This support of the offspring‐defense hypothesis of maternal territoriality is the first such evidence for a freshwater crustacean and is very similar to that recently reported in a related marine decapod, the American lobster ( H. americanus ).

Over the years, several scales related to aggression have been identified and validated both on adults and on children. Ultimately, two main higher order dimensions, emotional responsivity and proneness to aggression, repeatedly emerged in a series of second-order factor analysis. These dimensions are rather similar to two of the big five factors of personality: neuroticism/emotinal stability and hostility/agreeableness, respectively. Several studies corroborate the plausibility of a higher level bidimensional conceptualization of aggression that, while preserving the heuristic validity of looking for more specific constructs of aggression, can link the field of aggression to the field of personality. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Consistent with previous research and with the stereotype of machismo, Hispanics, particularly Hispanic males, were more likely to endorse some aggressive behaviors than Anglos. However, the same pattern of gender influences emerged for both ethnic groups. As predicted, males were more aggressive and more supportive of fighting back and punishing an aggressor than females, whereas females were more likely to show self-control about aggression and to endorse restraint. Respondents, particularly males, said that they would behave more aggressively toward a male, and they encouraged a male to behave more aggressively.

    "abstract": "Abstract A total of 125 growing pigs (47 days old) were tested for aggressive responses on two occasions using a resident‐intruder (R‐I) design. Our aims were twofold: (1) to attempt to replicate earlier work on pigs showing that resident aggression is a consistent individual characteristic, unaffected by weight or sex of the resident or intruder and (2) to develop behavioural measures to characterise the wide range of aggressive responses in the test. Resident pigs, housed since birth with littermates, were placed individually in a divided‐off portion of their home pen, and a smaller, unfamiliar intruder (approximately 66% of the resident's weight) was introduced. The test ended 5 min after the first investigation of the intruder by the resident or when one of the pigs began to attack the other (by delivering a sudden, rapid series of bites). On days 1 and 2, 33.6% and 43.2% of tests, respectively, ended in an attack by a resident. Intruder attacks were rare. Pigs were consistent in whether they attacked or not over the two tests, although attack latencies for pigs attacking in both tests were not correlated. Females were more likely to attack and attacked more quickly than males on the first test day but not in the second test or overall. Intruder sex had some effect on the test outcome (males were attacked more rapidly in the second test only). Resident and intruder weight had no effect. Aggressive pigs (meaning pigs that attacked vs. pigs that did not and fast‐attacking pigs vs. slow‐attacking pigs) showed a number of differences in behaviour during the R‐I test: (1) they took longer to make initial contact with the intruder in their first test; (2) they showed a higher frequency of aggressive acts (single head knocks, bites, and shoves); (3) they spent a greater proportion of the test engaging in social contact with the intruder rather than non‐social behaviours; (4) their social behaviour involved more postures directed toward the head as opposed to flank‐ or rear‐directed postures or re‐establishing social contact; and (5) they showed closer physical contact with intruders during social encounters, as characterised by their lower head positions. Some of these behavioural measures could be used to improve the measuring power of the test in the future. Improved behavioural measures would enable aggressiveness scoring among pigs that did not attack instead of classifying them all together as “non‐attacking.” Aggr.

Fifty participants played pinball in competition for points against an unknown peer, whose responses were actually controlled by the experimenter. Participants could push a noise button, sending the peer an annoying noise; a tilt button, interfering with the opponent's game; or a no answer button, offering a pro‐social alternative to aggression. After playing four rounds, participants were randomly assigned to either a reactive anger or a positive instrumental manipulation group; they then played pinball again for four rounds. Results indicate that the instrumental manipulation significantly lowered aggressive responses for both reactive and proactive behavior. The reactive manipulation effected aggressive responses only for use of the noise button and produced significantly lower levels of anger. Aggr. Behav. 29:215–227, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Variations in length or frequency of confrontation indicated that the rate of decline of attack bites and sideways threats depended on these confrontation parameters. The condition that provided the fewest opportunities to fight provided the least decline in the frequency of attack and threat. The frequency of attack bites and sideways threats elicited by the presentation of a new intruder after repeated confrontations was greater than the frequency of attack bite and sideways threat in the last confrontation with the original intruder, when the resident and intruder were relatively inexperienced. Spontaneous recovery of attack and threat occurred but rate of recovery did not depend on confrontation parameters.

    "abstract": "A sample of Chinese children in Grade 4 (155 boys and 135 girls with an average age of 10.3 years) completed Olweu' Aggression Inventory, an instrument developed for the assessment of aggressive and aggression controlling behavior tendencies in a Western culture. Results indicated that the questionnaire gave quite meaningful information when used with the Chinese children. Two interpretable factors, general aggression and aggression control, were derived; the pattern of factor loadings was essentially the same for boys and girls. The internal consistency reliabilities of the two factor scales were in the 0.80s and 0.70s, respectively. Overall, the findings indicated that there were distinct measurable individual differences among Chinese children in the domain of aggression—in spite of strong societal pressures against aggressive behavior and towards aggression control. However, some results suggested that aggression was a somewhat more global, or less differentiated, phenomenon for the Chinese as compared with the Swedish children. The two main factor scales were related meaningfully to other self report dimensions such as positive attitude to school and negative relations with parents. In all probability, the pattern of findings gave a valid picture of the behavior and attitudes of the Chinese children: By and large they were nonaggressive, well-behaved, ambitious, friendly, prosocial, and exerted strong control over aggressive feelings and behavior tendencies. In possible conflicts with adults, they were likely to take a humble and submissive attitude. These findings agree well with the impressions of Western observers and with what can be expected on the basis of the typical socialization patterns found in the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, quite marked sex differences in aggression were obtained and a partial correlation analysis showed that the higher aggression level of the boys could only to a very limited degree be explained by their lower level of aggression control or inhibitions. Generally, the sex differences in aggression were interpreted to reflect genetic variations in basic predispositions in boys and girls that had been subtly enlarged by more or less clear, sex-linked differences in environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The behaviour of offenders and victims in 116 cases of group robbery (61 commercial, 55 personal) was examined. Four interpersonal themes were evident: dominance, submission, co‐operation and hostility. These themes are governed by the principles of complementarity such that offender dominance elicits victim submission (reciprocity) and vice versa, while co‐operative offenders tend to elicit victim co‐operation (correspondence). Hostile offences were hypothesised as eliciting hostility in victims, but few victims in the sample demonstrated active resistance. The existence of behavioural themes suggests that offenders within the same group behave in a homogenous fashion, which is explained by reference to group norms and processes of modelling. Further, differences in interpersonal themes were evident between commercial and personal robberies. Commercial robberies tend to involve greater levels of co‐operation than personal robberies, while personal robberies involve more hostility than commercial robberies. This is discussed in terms of situational and motivational elements of the robberies. Aggr. Behav. 32:330–342, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Two forms of competitive encounters namely Randori (free fight) and Kata (highly ritualized fight) were studied in 22 professional male judo fighters. The dyadic, symmetrical (in terms of body weight and fighting ability) encounters were videotaped to assess relationships between agonistic behavior and individual variations in plasma levels of testosterone (T), cortisol (C) and interleukins (IL-6 and IL-1β) measured before and after the competition. Unremarkably, winners showed longer attack but devoted less time to defensive behaviors when compared to losers. T increased only during Randori but the individual pre- and post-competition T levels recorded in such fights were strongly correlated with the corresponding measures in the Kata for the same individuals. Interestingly, the pre- and post-Randori competition T levels were higher in losers than in winners and T variations positively correlated with the frequencies of attacks and with the duration of defensive postures. The T response shows individual variation and seems to reflect evaluation of the likelihood of winning or losing. Both Randori and Kata induced a marked C increase, although the pre- and post-Randori hormonal titers were higher than those found for the Kata. IL-6 significantly increased between the pre- and the post-Randori competition, but no such changes occurred during the Kata. No correlations were found between individual pre- and post-competition C and IL-6 and IL-1β levels in either Randori or Kata. This suggests that C and cytokine release are unrelated to emotional or cognitive perception of the possible outcome of fighting but are a consequence of general motor activity. Martial arts appear to provide good human models to understand: (a) the relationships between conflict, hormones and the immune system and (b) the relationships between mood and physiological responses to competitive aggression.

To investigate this possibility, 27 different expressions of the phrase “Don't do that” were tape-recorded. Subjects first rated how angry each utterance sounded and then categorized each utterance as expressing either frustration, threat, disgust, advice, or emotional neutrality. Some utterances were rated as angry and categorized as frustration; other utterances were also rated as angry, but categorized as threat.

Freely growing populations of house mice, consisting of all females and one male, stopped their growth at approximately the same densities as normal sexratio populations used as references. The mechanism(s) of female control of population dynamics may be related to female aggressive behavior. As the all-female/one-male populations approached their maximum size, the females began to show wounding patterns and social hierarchies in much the same manner as males in populations with normal sex ratios. The male in each of the populations was severely wounded in the posterior region, and each lost its tail as a result of injuries which could have been inflicted only by the females. The female social hierarchy can be seen only when there has been reproduction and population growth. Assembled populations of all females rarely exhibit aggressive behavior. Female aggression becomes apparent only when the population approaches its maximum size and thereafter. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that males are competitive among themselves for territory and social rank, and ultimately to mate with the females. Other investigators have indicated that females respond to population size, which may reflect increased competition between the females with the establishment of territories. Thus female agression may control population growth, a role previously ascribed to male aggression.",

    "abstract": "Hutchinson has recently [1983] suggested that the pain-aggression hypothesis can account for fighting behaviors of rats in natural or seminatural settings: Specifically, this viewpoint questions the validity of a distinction between offensive and defensive behaviors which holds that pain-produced attack is a component of the defense pattern. We argue that the distinction between offense and defense is based on many analytic points, including history and present circumstances of the behaving animal, differential domestication effects on the two behavior systems, and differential effects of manipulation of a number of independent variables, including brain lesions and stimulation, drugs and hormones, and alterations in the level of fear. Also, offensive and defensive behaviors are not merely different: They involve systematic patterns of back-attack (offense) and back-defense aimed at enabling or preventing, respectively, bites at a particular target (the opponent's back) which is specific to offensive attack. Both the target site for offensive attack and the behavior patterns of offense and defense are to a considerable degree preprogrammed in rats, and may be seen in socially naive animals under appropriate circumstances. Finally, the offense-defense distinction may be made in species other than the rat, and in a variety of natural and laboratory situations. The distinction may not, therefore, be rationally viewed as a misinterpretation of the fighting behaviors of rats in a colony situation. Hutchinson defends the pain-aggression hypothesis by means of an “alternative functional account” giving sequential and dyadic behaviors of fighting rats. However, crucial behavior descriptions of this scenario are strikingly at variance with our detailed records of social interactions in colonies and habitats, and appear to reflect a “best-case scenario” rather than actual data. The “alternative functional account” thus appears to be without substance as a basis for interpretation of aggression in rats.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies have demonstrated that increased socially related cognitive skills are associated with decreases in aggressive behavior. However, the link between aggression and intelligence or academic skills is less evident. While some research indicates that poor academic performance is related to aggression, it is unclear which components of intellectual ability and performance are critical to the management of aggressive behaviors. In two independent longitudinal studies of elementary school-age children, the relationship among several aspects of cognitive competence and several aspects of aggressive behavior were examined. The results of the first study showed that aggressive behavior observed in kindergarten children was more closely related to academic performance in the first and second grades than to general cognitive ability (IQ). The results of the second study, a comprehensive three-year investigation of upper elementary school-age children, indicated that teachers' assessments of aggression and parents' ratings of cruelty were consistent over time for boys, but not for girls. The intercorrelations among aggression measures within each of the three years also revealed stable sex differences. Boys identified as aggressive in the classroom were more likely to be perceived as aggressive, cruel, and/or delinquent at home, but for girls, there was little correlation between aggression at school and in the home. The analyses relating measures of cognitive functioning to indices of aggressive behavior made clear the importance of discriminating among various facets of these psychological constructs. IQ had a negligible relationship with aggression and a weak inverse relationship to delinquency. An overall index of cognitive functioning was a somewhat more consistent negative correlate of aggression, cruelty, and delinquency, especially for boys. A similar pattern was found for the correlates of academic performance. Academic disability was strongly related to delinquency in boys, and to a lesser degree to aggression in boys. Of the several cognitively related factors that were explored, Low Need Achievement manifested the strongest and most consistent relationships with the different facets of aggression and antisocial behavior, especially in boys. The implications of these results for psychological interventions in the school are discussed.",

Theories of alcohol and aggression suggest that impaired cognitive processing induced by acute intoxication leads individuals to process aggression-inducing social cues differently depending on whether they are high or low in salience.

An ethnically diverse sample of 74 primarily young adult participants (40 men and 34 women; M=23.28, SD=3.14 years) were recruited from the university community and surrounding area. All participants were provoked by an experimenter, randomly assigned to a 2 (alcohol condition: alcohol vs. placebo) x 2 (trigger salience: high vs. low salience) between-subjects design, and then given the opportunity to aggress against the undeserving triggering agent. As expected, intoxication combined with a salient triggering cue elicited the most displaced aggression among all conditions.

We used data from questionnaires and face‐to‐face interviews to examine the contributors to the occurrence and severity of women's experience of specific incidents of aggression in bars. Young women ( n =92) provided event‐based descriptions of their most recent experience of physical aggression in a bar during the past 24 months. Most aggression in bars was precipitated by rowdy behavior and involved female opponents who were strangers. The severity and overall aggressiveness of the respondent's behaviors were positively associated with initiating the incident and having a female opponent. The severity and overall aggressiveness of the opponent's behaviors were negatively associated with initiating the incident and positively associated with having a female opponent.

The present study examined the role of defeat by cage mates as a reason for this decline in aggressiveness. In Experiment I, highly aggressive isolated male mice were introduced into aggressive or nonaggressive resident groups. The intruder's level of aggressiveness directed toward a group-housed standard opponent declined more rapidly after daily exposure to the aggressive than to the nonaggressive groups. Intruders in the aggressive groups received more attacks from their cage mates, and delivered fewer attacks to them than did the intruders in the nonaggressive groups. In Experiment II, the intruders lived for seven days in small wire net cages in the middle of the group cages. Their level of aggressiveness toward standard opponents decreased little during the preexposure but after being put freely into the groups, their aggressiveness declined to a minimal level within a day. Experiment III showed that when the wire net protection in the middle of the cage was installed after the group caging experience, the aggressiveness of the intruders did not return to the isolation level as effectively as it did in isolation. This is explained by the aggression-inhibiting content that the cues from the cage mates have acquired during group caging. The decline of aggressiveness in male mice during group caging is determined by punishment delivered by the cage mates.",

Subjects were also asked to evaluate the degree of danger, benefit, fun and fear perceived for each risky choice. Analyses indicated that (a) risk decision-making was predicted by both trait anger and outward expression of anger; (b) appraisal of danger fully mediated the relationship between trait anger and risk; (c) perceptions of benefit, scare and fun partially mediated the relationship between trait anger and risk; and (d) appraisal of danger partially mediated the relationship between outward expression of anger and risk decision-making. The results provide evidence for a relationship between dispositional anger and risk decision-making during childhood, suggesting a possible explanation of the mechanisms below. In particular, risk decision-making can be viewed as the output of cognitive and emotive processes, linked to dispositional anger that leads children to be amused, optimistic and fearless in potentially risky situations.

Using adaptations of the Direct and Indirect Aggression Scale, a multi‐informant strategy, and a sample of disadvantaged families, data were collected from 296 mothers of children ages 4–11, 237 children ages 6–11, and 151 teachers of those children. Mothers and peers were reported to react more harshly in response to direct aggression compared with indirect aggression, and higher rates of direct aggression were associated with reduced popularity. These findings were seen as being consistent with the hypothesis that different forms of aggression result in differential responding by mothers and peers, as well as the notion that direct aggression is a higher cost option than indirect aggression. Results also replicated previous findings that boys tend to use physical aggression more than girls, but girls use indirect aggression more than boys. Finally, low IQ was correlated with higher direct aggression in girls but had no relation with aggression in boys. Aggr. Behav. 34: 497–510, 2008. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Isolation-induced intermale fighting in laboratory mice can be dramatically reduced under most circumstances by castration. This behavior in castrates may, however, be restored, or even accentuated, by androgen replacement. Experiments on the effects of sex steroids on such fighting in castrated mice, which, for want of a better term, are designated as \"aggressive,\" have been recently described. These mice are housed with a female until 10 days after siring a litter and are, thereafter, housed individually for a further 14 days before castration and subsequent hormone treatment. Such mice show substantial levels of fighting in \"standard-opponent\" tests even before isolation. Although castration results in reduced fighting in these mice, this behavior is rarely completely abolished in all individuals. It seems likely that steroid treatment of aggressive mice maintains or intensifies an already present motivation. Treatments in these studies consisted of daily oil-based intramuscular injections for 14 days preceding and throughout behavioral testing. The standard-opponent tests were 7 min encounters with adult, subordinate, grouped males in the cleaned home cages of experimental mice. The steroids investigated included estradiol benzoate (EB), 19-hydroxytestosterone (19-OHT), androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), and Sα-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), either singly or in combination. The results suggest that (a) on a dosage basis, estrogens were at least as effective as androgens in maintaining fighting in castrated aggressive mice; (b) 19-OHT (one of the metabolic intermediates between testosterone and 17 β-estradiol) was also effective but somewhat less so than the same dose of EB; (c) the three naturally occurring androgens investigated all effectively maintained fighting at comparatively low doses (50 μg/day) which compares with a replacement dose of 500 μg/day of T in some studies in traditional castrated mice (e.g., Luttge and Hall, 1973); (d) aromatization is not essential for a behavioral action of androgens as DHT, a nonaromatizable androgen, maintained fighting in these mice; (e) whereas a two-site (central motivational and peripheral penile) action seems probable in the influence of androgens on sexual behavior in castrated rats (e.g., Parrott, 1975), DHT did not augment the action of EB on fighting in castrated aggressive mice, indicating that only a central action of steroids was required in the aggressor.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Intruder and resident male colony mice exhibit an array of distinct defensive and offensive behaviors. Intruders typically show more boxing, flight, defensive sideways position, on the back position and general locomotion, while residents exhibit higher levels of attack, olfactory investigation, aggressive grooming, and biting, with a preference for dorsal bite locations. Here, analysis of bite locations on the body of the intruder mice showed that the majority of bites produced few lesions (i.e. actual puncturing of the skin) when compared to scrapes or no markings. Most bites were directed to the back of the opponent animal with very few bites directed towards the opponents' vulnerable ventrum. In particular, bites directed at the relatively hairless ventrum produced no lesions. These findings, along with previous work on mice and rats, suggest that intraspecific offense with preferred target sites for biting, facilitates an effective but largely nonwounding interaction between resident and intruder mice. Furthermore, bruise and wound analyses suggest an association between bite targets and tissue damage. The preference for specific bite locations may be complimented by a differential intensity of attack, with the back attracting the strongest bites and the ventrum the weakest. This apparent nonwounding fighting pattern contradicts the current evaluation of rodent wounding severity in this paradigm and can therefore refine the usage of this model and of the protocols associated with it.

    "abstract": "Abstract Prospective longitudinal studies have shown strong predictions from conduct disorders (CDs) in childhood to antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and violence in adults. However, little is known of the childhood antecedents of serious violence nor whether these may vary depending on the context in which the violence occurs. In this study, 54 men aged 21–40 years serving prison sentences for violent crime were assessed. Standardized interviews of ASPD and violence were conducted independently of interviews covering retrospective recall of childhood psychiatric disorders and adverse experiences. Analyses of the predictors of overall violence suggested a pathway involving childhood CD and adult ASPD associated with interparental discord, and an additional pathway associated with experiencing interparental violence in childhood. Different results were however obtained when account was taken of the context of the violence. The CD–ASPD pathway was associated with social violence, but not with partner violence. Partner violence was predicted by retrospective reports of having been exposed to interparental violence during childhood but not by reports of childhood CD or adult ASPD. Thus developmental pathways to serious violence may be different depending on the social domain in which the violence occurs. Aggr. Behav. 34:329–338, 2008. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

In this study, the effects of hostility and gender on the perception of angry, neutral, and happy faces and on the oscillatory dynamics of cortical responses elicited by these presentations were investigated using time–frequency decomposition by means of wavelet transforms. Feelings of hostility predisposed subjects to perceive happy and neutral faces as less friendly. This effect was more pronounced in women. In hostile subjects, presentation of emotional facial expressions also evoked stronger posterior synchronization in the theta and diminished desynchronization in the alpha band. This may signify a prevalence of emotional responding over cognitive processing. These effects were also more pronounced in females. Hostile females, but not hostile males, additionally showed a widespread synchronization in the alpha band. This synchronization is tentatively explained as a manifestation of inhibitory control which is present in aggressive females, but not in aggressive males. Aggr.

The dearth of research on pain tolerance and aggression appears to contradict the existing theory on the aggression-eliciting effect of pain, in that studies have found a positive relationship between pain tolerance and aggression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the relationship between pain tolerance and aggression is moderated by sex and whether the positive relationship could be explained by masculine gender role conformity. A sample of 195 collegiate men and women completed trait measures and a laboratory assessment of pain tolerance. Results indicated that correlations between pain tolerance and trait aggression were significant and positive for men but not women. However, when men's conformity to masculine gender role was controlled for, the relationship between pain tolerance and trait aggression was nil and nonsignificant.

This study examines the interrelation of distressing emotional stimulation and cognitive control in aggressive adolescents and healthy controls. We combined a color‐word Stroop test with pictures from the International Affective Picture System with either neutral or distressing emotional content to assess Stroop interference under neutral and distressing emotional stimulation in 20 male reactive aggressive patients with conduct disorder (CD) and 20 age‐matched male control participants. We found impaired Stroop performance under distressing emotional stimulation in patients compared to healthy controls. No difference was present under neutral emotional stimulation. Our results indicate that cognitive control under distressing emotional stimulation was affected in adolescents with CD but not in healthy controls. We conclude that executive functions in reactive aggressive CD patients are more susceptible to the deleterious effects of distressing emotional stimulation. The results provide a possible explanation for pathologic impulsive‐aggressive behavior under emotional distress in CD patients. Aggr. Behav. 40:109–119, 2014. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

A total of 287 Australian primary school students aged between 9 and 12 completed self-report measures of RS and aggression. As expected, RS and its components, angry and anxious expectations of rejection, were linked to generalized aggression (GA) in adolescents, with angry expectations being more strongly associated with GA and in particular, proactive aggression. As expected, RS predicted reactive aggression better than it did proactive aggression and a three-way interaction was found whereby the relationship between the type of RS and aggression differed as a function of the type of aggression. The present study offers new evidence to support the theory that RS is predictive of aggressive behavior in children and clarifies some confusion about the attributional affect and processes behind this behavior. The findings both support and extend existing research in the areas of RS and aggression.",

A significant positive relation between proactive and reactive aggression and the three subdimensions of psychopathy was also observed. Path analyses revealed that only narcissism was uniquely and positively related to proactive and reactive aggression. Tests of indirect effects from cortisol to aggression through subdimensions of psychopathy indicated significant pathways via narcissism to proactive and reactive aggression.

The authors experimentally tested the effects of group composition on deviant talk interaction processes among groups in which all members presented delinquent behaviors (“pure” delinquent group condition), those that included adolescents with no delinquent behaviors (“pure” normative group condition), and adolescents with both profiles (“mixed” group condition). Participants were 70 male adolescents aged 15–18 ( M = 16.5; 56% Caucasian), with a random assignment to groups. Data were collected among three group sessions (T1, T2, T3), one session a week, using videotape. Two contents of interactions were also measured: antisocial and normative stories, counterbalanced across sessions. Results showed a significant group effect for antisocial talk and its reinforcement, with less antisocial talk within the mixed group condition in comparison to the pure delinquent group condition. The topic of interaction was also observed as a predictor of antisocial talk, with less normative interactions and more antisocial talk associated with antisocial topics. Finally, time moderated some relations between experimental groups and talk. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for future research on deviancy training processes. Aggr.

Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 39, 645–656). The curvilinear associations between social competence bias and two forms of aggression (physical and relational) were examined in a sample of 4th through 6th graders ( n = 183); moderation by both sex and peer status (peer preference and popularity) also were tested. Social competence bias was operationally defined as the residual difference between child and teacher ratings of the child's social competence. Aggression and peer status were measured using peer nomination procedures. There was a significant curvilinear association between social competence bias and physical aggression moderated by both types of peer status. For low peer status children greater underestimation and overestimation of social competence was associated with higher physical aggression. The curvilinear association between social competence bias and relational aggression was moderated by both peer status and sex. Popular boys had higher rates of relational aggression when they had accurate, rather than biased, self‐perceptions of social competence. However, for very highly preferred girls, a more extreme positive bias was associated with an exponential increase in relational aggression.

The current study examined associations between aggressors' targeting tendencies (victims' social standing and number of victims) and aggressors' own social standing, both concurrently and over time. Analyses were conducted using three analytic samples of seventh and eighth grade aggressors (Ns ranged from 161 to 383, 49% girls; 50% Latina/o). Participants nominated their friends; nominations were used to calculate social network prestige. Peer nominations were used to identify aggressors and their victim(s). For each aggressor, number of victims and victims' social network prestige were assessed. Aggressors with more victims and with highly prestigious victims had higher social network prestige themselves, and they increased more in prestige over time than aggressors with fewer victims and less prestigious victims (though there were some differences across analytic samples).

We also examined whether gender moderated these prospective associations. Participants were 1,344 children who were assessed yearly from ages 3 to 10 years as part of the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD). BMI predicted annual increases in victimization for girls aged 6 years and over; for boys aged 7 and 8 years of age, higher BMI reduced victimization over the school year. Further, victimization predicted annual increases in BMI for girls after age 6 years. When these short-term effects were held constant, victimization was also shown to have a three and 5-year influence on annual BMI changes for girls from age 3 years. These short- and long-term cross-lagged effects were evident when the effects of family adversity were controlled. The findings support those from previous prospective research showing a link between higher BMI and victimization, but only for girls. Further, being victimized increased the likelihood that girls would put on weight over time, which then increased future victimization. The implications of these prospective findings for interventions are considered. Aggr. Behav. 42:109-122, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Comparisons were made between the violent male offenders ( N = 185), the violent female offenders ( N = 113), the non‐violent male offenders ( N = 150), and the non‐violent female offenders ( N = 138) for these variables. These were followed by a multinomial logistic regression analysis. The findings indicated that engaging in self‐harm was the best predictor of being a female violent offender, with the predictors of giving into pressure from others and attempted suicide nearing significance. Furthermore, non‐violent females were significantly less likely to lose control of their temper and more likely to give in to pressure from others than their violent counterparts. Non‐violent males were significantly less likely to lose control of their temper and more likely to self‐harm and give in to pressure from others than violent males. Although many similarities existed between sexes for predictors of violent offending, the findings of this study indicate that more attention needs to be paid to the mental health of female offenders.

    "abstract": "Social rejection can increase aggression, especially among people high in rejection sensitivity. Rejection impairs self-control, and deficits in self-control often result in aggression. A dose of glucose can counteract the effect of situational factors that undermine self-control. But no research has integrated these literatures to understand why rejection increases aggression, and how to reduce it. Using the I(3) model of aggression, we proposed that aggression would be highest under conditions of high instigation (rejection), high impellance (high rejection sensitivity), and low inhibition (drinking a beverage sweetened with a sugar substitute instead of glucose). As predicted, aggression was highest among participants who experienced social rejection, were high in rejection sensitivity, and drank a placebo beverage. A dose of glucose reduced aggression, especially among rejected people high in rejection sensitivity. These findings point to the importance of self-control in understanding why social rejection increases aggression, and how to prevent it.",

    "abstract": "Physical aggression (PA) in the toddler years is common and developmentally normal, however, longitudinal research shows that frequent PA is highly stable and associated with long‐term negative outcomes. Significant research has demonstrated the efficacy of parenting interventions for reducing externalizing behavior in children yet their typical length may overburden families, leading to low participation rates and high attrition rates. To increase the reach of parenting interventions and impact on the prevalence of externalizing behavior problems, brief interventions are needed. This RCT compared a standard (8 session) group Triple P to a brief (3 session) discussion group and a waitlist control for reducing toddler PA, dysfunctional parenting and related aspects of parent functioning. Sixty‐nine self‐referred families of toddlers with PA were randomized to the respective conditions. At post‐assessment, families in the standard intervention had significantly lower levels of observed child aversive behavior, mother reports of PA and dysfunctional parenting, and higher levels of mother‐ and partner‐rated behavioral self‐efficacy than the waitlist control. Families in the standard intervention also had significantly lower levels mother‐rated dysfunctional parenting than the brief intervention, and the brief intervention had significantly lower levels of mother‐rated dysfunctional parenting than waitlist. There were no significant group differences at post‐assessment for measures of parental negative affect or satisfaction with the partner relationship. By 6 month follow‐up, families in the brief and standard intervention did not differ significantly on any measure. The implications of the findings to delivery of brief parenting interventions are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 43:291–303, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The current short-term longitudinal study evaluated whether anxiety symptoms moderated the bidirectional associations between forms (i.e., physical and relational) of aggression and peer victimization over a 1-year period during middle childhood. Participants were 228 predominantly Caucasian children (50.4% boys; M = 8.32 years, SD = .95 years) in the second through fourth grades and their homeroom teachers. Children completed a self-report measure of anxiety symptoms at Time 1. Peer victimization was assessed using self-reports at Time 1 and approximately 1 year later (Time 2), and teachers provided ratings of children's aggressive behavior at both time points. A series of cross-lagged path analysis models indicated that high (+1 SD) initial levels of anxiety symptoms exacerbated the prospective link from Time 1 relational aggression to Time 2 peer victimization; conversely, when initial levels of anxiety symptoms were low (-1 SD), relational aggression predicted lower levels of subsequent peer victimization. Time 1 peer victimization was also found to predict lower levels of Time 2 physical aggression when initial levels of anxiety symptoms were low, and Time 1 anxiety symptoms were uniquely related to higher levels of relational aggression over a 1-year period. Regions of significance were calculated to further decompose significant interactions, which did not differ according to gender. Study findings are discussed within a social information processing theoretical framework, and directions for future research and implications for practice are reviewed. Specifically, co-occurring anxiety symptoms may need to be addressed in interventions for both aggression and peer victimization during middle childhood.",

For this purpose, we asked 681 participants from the general population (GP) and 282 general psychiatric patients (PPs) to answer the German versions of the Short Questionnaire for Assessing Factors of Aggression (K‐FAF), the Multidimensional Self‐Esteem Scale (MSWS), and the Brief Symptom Inventory 25 Forensic (BSI‐25‐F). Statistically, we performed descriptive and mediation analyses. Our findings indicated that in both samples the association between self‐aggression and reactive aggression was mediated by self‐esteem but not by current psychological problems. The association between self‐aggression and spontaneous aggression was mediated by self‐esteem in the GP sample and by psychopathological symptoms in the PP sample. We conclude that when examining the association between self‐aggression and externalized aggression it is important to consider the various subtypes of externalized aggression and differences between populations.",

What is the impact of a violent crime being described in an animalistic versus a non‐animalistic way on the subsequent retribution toward the perpetrator? In two studies, we experimentally varied animalistic descriptions of a violent crime and examined its effect on the severity of the punishment for the act. In Study 1, we showed that compared to non‐animalistic descriptions, animalistic descriptions resulted in significantly harsher punishment for the perpetrator. In Study 2, we replicated this effect and further demonstrated that this harsher sentencing is explained by an increase in perceived risk of recidivism. Our findings suggest that animalistic descriptions of crimes lead to more retaliation against the perpetrator by inducing the perception that he is likely to continue engaging in violence. Aggr.

    "abstract": "We examined risk of male premature mortality associated with recent criminal victimization. Prior victimization is among the most consistent predictors of future risk but the explanation of repeat victimization remains elusive. Two general perspectives frame this debate. According to the state-dependence perspective, repeat victimization is forged through intervening processes connecting an initial with a subsequent violent victimization. According to the risk-heterogeneity perspective, this association is spurious because all victimization events for a person result from underlying individual traits. Research on health outcomes and premature mortality provides related, but often overlooked, conceptual assumptions about the co-occurring health burden of preventable injuries and disease. We extend and apply each of these perspectives in the current study to assess the nature and sources of repeat violent victimization. Data were from the Izhevsk (Russia) Family Study, a large-scale population-based case-control study. Cases (n = 1750) were all male deaths aged 25-54 living in Izhevsk between October 2003 and October 2005. Controls (n = 1750) were randomly selected from a city population register. Key independent variables were prior year prevalence of violent, property, and residential victimization. We used logistic regression to estimate mortality odds ratios. Results provided evidence for state dependence. We found that (i) after controlling for indicators of risk heterogeneity men who had been victims of violence (but not property or residential crime) within the past year were 2.6 times more likely than those who had not to die prematurely; and (ii) the only type of death for which risk was higher was homicide.

The objective of this study was to identify the main socioeconomic characteristics, personal experiences, resources, and competencies associated with sexism in a sample of adolescents from different European countries. Baseline data from the Lights4Violence project included 1555 students ages 12–17 from secondary schools in six European countries (Spain, Italy, Romania, United Kingdom, Portugal, and Poland). Linear regression models were carried out, stratified by sex for benevolent (BS) and hostile (HS) dimensions of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. The average age of the sample was 14.3 years (SD = 1.5), 59.3% were girls. Boys scored higher on the measure of sexism (mean BS = 29.7; HS = 29.1) than girls (BS = 27.5, HS = 23.0; p &lt; .001). Girls whose mothers had a university degree reported lower BS (β = −0.113; p = .023) (reference: lower education). Girls who had experienced dating violence reported higher HS (β = .080; p = .010) than those who had never been in an intimate relationship. For both sexes, high aggressiveness was associated with high levels of HS, and high aggressiveness was related to high levels of BS in boys. High assertiveness was associated with high levels of BS in both sexes and with high levels of HS in boys. A high level of problem‐solving ability was associated with lower HS in both sexes. The study reinforces the need to invest in school programs aimed at preventing dating violence and promoting positive youth development.",

Online trolling can be influenced by personal factors and psychological states.

A total of 1123 college students completed questionnaires regarding their experience with online trolling, mindfulness, social media fatigue, and moral disengagement. The results showed that individuals with high mindfulness were less likely to troll others online, which was mediated by their social media fatigue. Furthermore, moral disengagement moderated the indirect relationship between mindfulness and online trolling. Specifically, the relationship between mindfulness and social media fatigue became weaker for individuals with high moral disengagement. The relationship between social media fatigue and online trolling became strengthened for individuals with high moral disengagement. These findings elucidate the role of personal factors and the present internal state in online trolling and suggest that comprehensive intervention programs may be promising for reducing online trolling.",

However, understanding adolescents’ responses to hate speech is critical because this kind of research can support schools in empowering students to exhibit courageous moral behavior. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the newly developed Multidimensional Bystander Responses to Hate Speech Scale (MBRHS) and to explore demographic differences and correlates of bystander behavior in school hate speech. The sample consisted of 3225 seventh to ninth graders from Germany and Switzerland. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a model with seven factors. We found that adolescents with immigrant background and boys showed particularly unfavorable response patterns. In addition, our study suggests that empathy is positively correlated with the factors comforting the victim, seeking help at school , and countering hate speech but negatively correlated with helplessness , revenge , reinforcing , and ignoring . Moral disengagement showed the opposite correlational pattern. The findings indicate that the MBRHS is a psychometrically valid and reliable measure that could aid in measuring varied responses to hate speech. In addition, this work highlights the relevance of empathy and moral engagement training in anti‐hate speech prevention programs.",

The subjects were the parents of 26 aggressive 12- and 13-year-old girls (24 mothers and 13 fathers) and of 32 non-aggressive girls (32 mothers and 24 fathers). Social problem-solving strategies were assessed from the mothers' and fathers' descriptions of six social problems arising in the daily lives of their daughters. The results showed that the mothers of the aggressive girls scored higher on reprimanding and on indifference than the mothers of the non-aggressive girls, who discussed the problems with their daughters more. When the family system formed by both of the parents was treated as one unit, differences in the frequencies of social problem-solving strategies between the families of the aggressive and non-aggressive girls were also found. The parents of the aggressive girls advised their daughters on solving social problems typically (i.e., more often than the chance level) only if they directly asked for help. The mothers typically did not discuss the problems with their daughters or try to solve the problems themselves but more often diverted the responsibility to some persons outside of the home. The fathers were typically indifferent. In other words, these girls were often left without help from their parents. On the other hand, in the families with non-aggressive girls, indifference, avoiding discussion, and diverting responsibility were atypical strategies (i.e., more rare than the chance level). These results emphasize the role of the mothers, and especially the meaning of the family system, in predicting girls' aggressiveness. Aggr. Behav. 24:37–51, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Three studies are presented in this essay examining perceptions of communication strategies used in response to conflict events between mentors and proteges. The first study identifies a set of conflict events that proteges characterize as occurring between themselves and their mentors. Also identified in this study are strategies specified by proteges as responses to conflicts with their mentors. The second study tests a predictive model of specific conflict events that are likely to engender categories of responses and appeasement events. Gender differences in perceptions of conflict and in provocative or appeasement responses to conflict events are tested as well. The third study examines mentors' perceptions of protege responses to conflict events in terms of forgiveness, respect, esteem, anger reduction, and reduction of the conflict. These studies identified the frequency of perceived conflict events and protege preference in responding to disturbed social relations with their mentor. \"My mentor has asked me to help him or her with projects,\" and \"My mentor has disagreed with me,\" were the most frequently cited conflict events and \"I have tried to do a better job,\" and \"I have tried to work harder,\" were the most frequently cited response strategies used in appeasement attempts. Conflict events comprised of Negativity, Embarrassment, and Disagreements were predictive of Provocative and Distancing responses. Conflict events comprised of Disagreements approached significance in predicting Pragmatic Appeasement responses. Overall male proteges perceived more events as conflict producing than did female proteges. Male proteges were more likely to argue with their mentors than were female proteges, however they were also more likely to make sacrifices for their mentor and to report greater compliance with their mentor's wishes than were female proteges. Pragmatic Appeasement strategies received high overall evaluations for reconciliation in terms of increased forgiveness, respect, and esteem as well as for anger and conflict reduction. There were no primary gender differences for Mentor responses to reconciliation attempts. The results of this study were discussed in terms of Kelter, Young and Buswell's model of the process of appeasement [in press]. Aggr. Behav. 23:389–403, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Presentation of a natural predator, a cat, was used to differentiate elements of maternal attack by female rats on a male intruder. Following exposure (without direct physical contact) of post-partum females to a cat or to a toy stuffed cat (control group), the females were replaced in their home cages and presented with a male intruder rat. Cat exposure reliably decreased lateral attack to the intruder, as well as locomotion, but had no effect on either jump attack or an upright defensive posture (boxing). Since predator exposure produces a somewhat durable increase in defense, along with inhibition of nondefensive behavior, these results suggest that maternal aggression represents a mixture of offensive, usually related to competition, and defensive (protective) behaviors. The results indicate that maternal aggression, as a parental care behavior, appears to be at least partially resistant to fear. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

As such, the Yanomami provide a microcosm of several aspects of the anthropology of conflict and aggression. After some background, a critical analysis is developed of 10 problem areas that call into serious question the scientific status of Yanomami as one of the most violent human societies ever known in anthropology: the Yanomami as \"the fierce people\"; documentation of their aggression; inflation of their aggression as warfare; neglect of cross-cultural perspective; modern warfare as reversion to tribalization; the negative concept of peace; male sexist bias; the Yanomami as \"primitive\"; the character of debates; and research priorities and professional ethics.

    "abstract": "In the developmental literature, indications of different structures or patterns of peer aggression can be found. Examples are a dominance structure and a central victim or \"scapegoat\" structure. The present study investigated (1) which of eight structural models best characterizes the prevailing structure in school classes of young children, (2) which variables affect the aggressor-victim relationship, and (3) whether physically vs. generally aggressive relationships have a different structure. A total of 1,090 children (aged 4 to 5 years) in 84 school classes were asked to nominate classmates who are aggressive toward them. Social network analyses showed a \"combined central victim/aggressor model\" to be the predominant pattern for both physical and general aggression. According to this model, a minority of children are only victims and a minority of children are only aggressors. Children who are aggressive toward weaker children may themselves be the victim of more aggressive peers as well. The model is further characterized by transitivity, few indirect relations, and relatively short distances between the children in the social network. In addition, the children involved in an aggressive relationship are typically dissimilar with respect to the degree of aggression. Although the model describes unilateral relations in particular, reciprocal relations also occur. Apart from dissimilarity in the degree of aggression, the children involved in an aggressive relationship are less similar with respect to sex and negative sociometric score than are arbitrary combinations of children. Age, positive sociometric score, sharing candy, and physical attractiveness do not affect aggressive relationships. By applying social network analysis, this study answers the recent call of several researchers to (1) concentrate on the relationship between aggressor and victim and (2) study this relationship from the perspective of the entire group (school class) rather than isolated dyads of children.

This experiment examined the effect of food features on the form and vigor of the dodging movement. Dodge probability and its amplitude were measured as a function of food size, elapsed eating time, food hardness, and the way in which food theft was attempted. Under all conditions dodge probability and its amplitude were directly related to the time necessary to complete eating. Thus, rats estimated the time required to complete eating and adjusted the size of their evasive movements to gain this time. The results show that although dodging has the appearance of a fixed-action pattern, it is influenced by cognitive processes that may be similar to those that direct other aspects of foraging behavior. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Electrocardiograms were telemetrically recorded during maternal aggression, social defeat, and psychosocial stimulation, as obtained using the classical resident-intruder paradigm. Autonomic input to the heart was indirectly evaluated by means of heart rate variability measures and plasma catecholamine level determinations. Social stressors produced changes in cardiac electrical activity that were markedly higher than those observed in nonsocial challenging conditions such as novelty and restraint. Defeat, which produced the highest catecholaminergic responses, was the most potent as a social aversive experience in inducing heart rate accelerations and arrhythmias, particularly when applied to a wild-type strain of rats. The far most frequent arrhythmic events were ventricular and supraventricular premature beats, either as isolated events or grouped. Ventricular premature beats usually occurred immediately after attacks and in association with higher heart rate values and lower heart rate variability scores. The relationships between the type of stressor used (either social or nonsocial), the different contributions of the emotional and physical components of stress response, the resulting modulation of autonomic control over cardiac electrical activity, and the incidence of arrhythmic events are discussed.

Three theorized mechanisms on which individuals display differential vulnerability and which are related to risk are discussed. These are the cue for reinforcement system, the threat system, and the executive control system. Under the latter heading new findings from a number of studies are presented which demonstrate that: under low provocation intoxicated executive cognitive functioning (ECF) individuals performed with significantly more aggression than sober or intoxicated high ECF individuals; that individuals with low ECF, though more aggressive, choose these responses more slowly than those with high ECF; that low ECF, unlike high ECF, individuals do not react to anticipated shock; and, it is specifically low sober state ECF individuals who show increased alcohol induced ECF disruption who are most at risk for intoxicated aggression.

According to prediction, when deindividuated and aroused by caffeine the amount of noxious stimulation subjects delivered to the provocateur was greater if they believed that the drug they had taken was nonarousing than if they thought it was a stimulant; in contrast, individuated subjects' aggression was greater when aroused subjects believed the drug was a stimulant.

The data consisted of opinion surveys sent to staff of 15 child, adolescent, and adult psychiatry inpatient units in the United States. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the level of assault and staff‐reported injury prediction that could be obtained from the staff‐completed opinion survey. Responses indicated a high prevalence of reported aggression, with 62.3% of staff endorsing verbal and physical aggression, property destruction, and self‐injurious behavior as being prevalent at their site, whereas only 4.1% rated none of these as prevalent. Staff working with children and adolescents in settings with high rates of psychiatric diagnoses reported increased frequency of assault and injury compared with those working with adults. Younger, less experienced staff reported higher rates of assault and injury. Staff working with female patients reported similar rates of assault and injury to those working with males. A logistic regression analysis using staff‐reported survey results of both staff and patient characteristics predicted assault correctly 73.7% of the time and injury 66.1% of the time. Resources for violence prevention and staff training programs in violence prevention are needed in child and adolescent psychiatry wards. Results are consistent with theories emphasizing the importance of negative emotions and affects, impulsivity, and frustration in goal‐directed activities in human aggression. Aggr.

This study analyzed all cases in which adult immigrant males behaved aggressively toward adult females in a large population of free‐living hyenas in Kenya, observed for 11 years. Our goals were to describe the conditions under which male attacks on females occur, and address possible adaptive functions. Most aggression directed by adult immigrant males against females occurred when coalitions of two or more males attacked a single adult female, who typically responded by defending herself and fighting back. Male aggression against females frequently occurred at sites of ungulate kills, but males never behaved aggressively toward females over food, and all male attacks on females were unprovoked. Although no mounting or other copulatory behaviors ever occurred during or immediately after an attack, the number of male attacks on females peaked around the time of conception. Daily rates at which males attacked females did not vary with female social rank. However, daily attack rates did vary significantly with female reproductive state, and the highest rates of male attack on females were observed during the two stages of the reproductive cycle during which females were most likely to conceive litters. The adaptive significance of male aggression against females in this species remains unknown, but a tight association between male attacks on females and a female's time of conception provides strong evidence of some role for male aggression in hyena sexual behavior. In particular, our data are consistent with hypotheses suggesting that male aggression toward females in this species either serves to inform females about male fitness or represents sexual harassment.

    "abstract": "The TV viewing habits of 391 8-year-old and 10-year-old Finnish children were related to their aggression, their aggressive and fear fantasies, and their dreams and fantasies about TV. Two measurements of aggression were made: peer-nominated aggression and self-rated aggression. TV viewing habits were measured by the amount of TV seen during a week and violence viewing, that is, how regularly violent TV serials were watched. Hypothetically, in addition to a direct relationship between TV viewing and aggression, there could also be an indirect relationship; for example, fantasizing might provide a link in the TV viewing-aggression relationship. There were significant positive correlations for the boys between TV viewing variables and aggression. There were also significant positive correlations between the amount of TV and televised violence viewing and fear and aggressive fantasies in general and with dreams and fantasies about actual TV programs seen. The correlations were less frequent for the girls. The same tendencies were evident for age groups and education. More frequent positive correlations were found with older children and regular classes than with younger children and music classes. The use of fantasy was also correlated positively with both peer-nominated and self-rated aggression. The results of the present study support the information-processing theory, which suggests that the more a child watches TV the more he or she has fantasies about the programs and rehearses the scenes viewed which, in turn, results in explicit aggressive behavior.",

Neonates, 23-day-old prepubertals, and adult male mice were studied. A morphometric method was used to quantify 3β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (3β-3HSD)-stained Leydig cells in testicular sections to determine testosterone secretory capacity. We consider this parameter to reflect circulating testosterone in the plasma. The results of this study show that the testosterone secretory capacity of Leydig cells in the testis changes differentially during development in males of the aggressive and nonaggressive selection lines. This capacity is highest in the aggressive selection line males at adulthood and at the prepubertal age of 23 days. Surprisingly, at birth, the highest T-secretory capacity was observed in the males of the nonaggressive selection line. The significance of an interaction between genetic factors and differences in perinatal testosterone for the individual variation in adult aggressive behavior is discussed.",

The study proposed that ethnicity of the target person (within subject variable) and participant's sex (between subject variable) will differ between respondents' level of NOBAG and empathy: Higher NOBAG and lower empathy toward an outgroup member were expected. Sex differences were expected on all variables, as well as intercorrelations among them. Measures included the Revised Normative Beliefs Measure (NOBAG: general and specific), The Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents (general and specific), and the Intergroup Anxiety Scale. The study population included 186 elementary-school children from two Arab schools in Israel. Results indicated that all participants support an aggressive reaction to a child of an outgroup more than to one of their own group and exhibit a greater degree of empathy toward the latter. Sex differences were found on all variables except on specific NOBAG. Correlation coefficients suggest sex differences in relations between variables. Results of a Logistic regression for the prediction of NOBAG toward ingroup/outgroup person indicated that empathy toward Jews predicted NOBAG in both sexes while intergroup anxiety predicted NOBAG in a different way for boys and girls. The discussion refers to the need for peace education to reduce anxiety and promote empathy. Aggr. Behav. 00:000–000, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Professional skills to adequately manage patient aggression are a prerequisite for nurses working in psychiatric hospitals. These ‘technical’ skills, however, are necessary but not sufficient for effective nurse intervention. The attitude of nurses' towards client aggression also contributes to their response to a patient's behaviour. In order to study the domains (types) of attitudes towards aggression, a sample was taken of nurses working in the fields of general psychiatry (n=288), psychiatry for children and adolescents (n=242) and psychogeriatrics (n=88). A cross-sectional survey design was adopted for the study. The Attitudes Towards Aggression Scale (ATAS) consisting of 32 items is presented, representing three types of attitudes towards aggression: aggression as a ‘harming’ reaction, a ‘normal’ reaction and a ‘functional’ reaction. The strongest predictors of the type of attitude respondents had towards the aggressive behaviour of their clients were (1) field, (2) setting they worked in, (3) gender and (4) type of shifts they predominantly had. Although the measure of domains of nurses' attitudes towards aggression needs further psychometric testing, it can be a useful tool in clinical practice for the assessment of staff attitudes towards aggression. This can support the decision-making about the management of aggressive behaviour on a ward. Aggr. Behav. 00:1–10, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The participants were instructed to express their willingness to forgive in two contexts—physical aggression and psychological aggression—which constituted a within‐subject factor. Five sets of scenarios corresponding to the five between‐subject factors (from social proximity to intent to harm) were used. Participants were 215 adults aged 17–60 years. As hypothesized, the cancellation of the consequences had less impact, and the apologies and the intent to harm had more impact, on the willingness to forgive in the case of physical aggression than in the case of psychological aggression. This result was a robust one; it did not depend on the participant's gender and age. Aggr. Behav. 00:1–12, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The electrical stimulation did not produce seizure discharges, but it did transiently reduce potentials evoked in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) by single pulsed stimulation of the amygdala. At the same time, defensive response to rats decreased, and time spent biting rats increased. Size of the evoked potential covaried directly with the transient changes in defensive behavior but not with the changes in predatory attack. More lasting decreases in defensive behavior were not associated with a lasting decrease in amygdalohypothalamic transmission. Preliminary data suggest that lasting changes in defensiveness may be mediated by the ventral hippocampus. These findings, in combination with other studies, indicate that variation in transmission of excitatory activity between the amygdala and VMH is at least necessary for variation in defensive response to prey.",

The effects of alcohol, d-amphetamine, haloperidol, naloxone, scopolamine, and the antidepressants mianserine and imipramine are described as well as those of some serotonergic drugs, like the specific 5-HT1a agonist flesinoxan, the nonspecific 5-HT1 antagonist methysergide, and the specific 5-HT3 antagonists odansetron (GR38032F) and MDL 72222. A remarkable similarity is found in the effects of these drugs on female and male aggression, although some differences occur. Despite obvious differences in temporal and neural organization and in physiological, hormonal, and environmental mechanisms involved in aggression in male and female rodents, the pharmacological evidence points to the similarities of the neural substrates underlying aggressive behaviour in both genders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The dominant mode of studying the antecedents of human aggression in psychology has been to look for these precursors in negative life events, for example, being physically punished, observing models using aggressive means, or experiencing forms of privation or frustration. In contrast, within the ethological literature, certain playful activities, in particular “play fighting,” have been interpreted as crucial precursors of later social activities, both aggressive and nonaggressive. Among humans, horseplay, which may be considered synonymous with play fighting, has only rarely been mentioned in psychological literature and scarcely ever in relation to aggression. Within this study, college students rated the extent to which they had engaged in horseplay and in aggressive acts with same‐sex friends and boyfriends or girlfriends over the past 3 years. Analyses indicated that a broad range of playful and aggressive activities was reported by a large proportion of the sample. Results also indicated strong relationships between the tendency to horseplay and to aggress. The relationship was strongest for men with men friends and for women with boyfriends. In general, having steady relationships increased the likelihood that both horseplay and aggressive acts would occur. Weekend alcohol consumption was related to playful activities; heavier use correlated with greater aggressive activities of men with men only. The study suggests that it is useful to broaden the base for conceptualizing aggression to take into account the ways in which playful and friendly activities can facilitate those that are regarded as antisocial and aggressive.",

Two groups of university men were unexpectedly kept from winning a money prize for working on a motor task, and one group was induced to attribute this failure to their partner's misbehavior (illegitimate frustration) while the other men were told the failure was due to the apparatus (legitimate frustration). In comparison to a nonthwarted control group, both frustrated conditions displayed the same level of internal arousal. However, when all subjects had an opportunity to “supervise” a second partner on an unrelated task soon afterwards, only those who had been illegitimately thwarted earlier were now more openly punitive toward this “innocent” individual than the control group. Possible reasons for these results are discussed, but it is emphasized that a distinction must be drawn between the internal and external reactions to a frustration.",

All three phenotypes were associated positively and affected by genes (sexual coercion 28%, alcohol use 60%, psychopathy 54%), with 46% of the correlation between sexual coercion and psychopathy, 89% of the correlation between alcohol use and psychopathy and 100% of the correlation between sexual coercion and alcohol use being explained by shared genetic effects. Further, the results showed that a proportion of the variance in sexual coercion was derived from a highly genetic source that was common with alcohol use and psychopathy. This latent factor was hypothesized to reflect a general tendency for antisocial behavior that is pervasive across different situations.

Structural equation modeling demonstrated that the relation between support for the war and attitudes toward terrorism and relevance could be explained adequately by a model in which anger mediated the effects of attitudes and relevance on support. Attitudes toward terrorism were further identified as mediators that could explain the group effect by Christians. The result was not only generalizable across the conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, but also in terms of how consent for war manifests itself—outright calls for bloodshed versus more subtle, politically loaded, posturing (e.g. entreaties to “support our troops”).

All of the drugs tested selectively antagonized the killing behavior of both spontaneous and lesion-induced mouse-killing rats. Several drugs (i.e., imipramine, amitriptyline, d-amphetamine, and chlorpheniramine) were found to be significantly less potent antagonists of mouse killing in the 0.6. lesioned rat as compared to spontaneous killers. Since all of the drugs that exhibited significant differences in activity between the two models have been shown to possess the ability to elevate norepinephrine levels at receptor sites in the brain, alterations in noradrenergic systems may account for the differences in sensitivity that were observed in this study. The possibility that there may be a common neural substrate for mouse killing in the two models is discussed.",

A qualitative pilot study provides a strong rationale for a subsequent empirical investigation of 100 young adult, self‐identified gay males. Results of both studies demonstrate that relational aggression and relational victimization are common experiences in gay male relationships. They also reveal forms of relational aggression and victimization that appear to be unique to gay males (e.g., outing). Results of the empirical study found significant relations between engaging in relational aggression against gay males and experiencing relational victimization and between experiencing relational victimization and internalized homophobia. However, there was no significant correlation between internalized homophobia and engaging in relational aggression. A multiple regression analysis found that experiencing relational victimization was correlated more strongly with the combination of engaging in relational aggression and internalized homophobia together than with relational aggression alone. Results are discussed within the framework of Allport's “traits due to victimization” theory and Meyer's theory of “minority stress.” Implications for the prevention of relational aggression/victimization in gay male relationships are offered.

Among humans, the loss of social status has been studied primarily in the context of athletic competition, with winners having higher testosterone levels than losers. This study examined testosterone levels in relation to peer victimization (bullying) in a sample of 151 boys and girls aged 12–13. Statistically controlling for age and pubertal status, results indicated that on average verbally bullied girls produced less testosterone and verbally bullied boys produced more testosterone than their nonbullied counterparts. Similar trends were evident comparing social and physical bullying with testosterone. Sex differences are discussed in terms of empirically validated differences in coping styles, as girls tend to internalize, whereas boys tend to externalize, their abuse. Aggr.

Alcohol use was operationalized as a latent factor with self‐ and partner reports of problem drinking as measured by the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test and the Alcohol Dependence Scale. Verbal aggression by husbands or wives, by itself, has no effect on their alcohol use over time. In conjunction with depression, however, verbally aggressive husbands do have elevated drinking levels. The effects of husbands' and wives' physical aggression on their own and their partners' drinking behavior were also significant. This study is one of the first to examine the change over time in alcohol use for marital partners as related to marital aggression and internalizing symptoms. Our results shed light on areas of marital functioning (aggression, internalizing, alcohol use) that have not been investigated in conjunction with each other in a longitudinal design. Aggr.

The current study sought to examine the moderating effect of teacher preference on the association between distinct forms of aggressive behavior (i.e., physical aggression and relational aggression) and social status (i.e., rejection and popularity), and to explore whether these associations differed for boys and girls. Fourth and fifth grade students ( N = 193) completed peer nomination procedures to assess rejection and aggressive behavior and teachers provided self‐reports of their preferences for their students. Findings indicated that relationally aggressive girls were more likely to be popular with their peers when their teachers also liked them. In addition, both relationally and physically aggressive girls were less likely to be rejected by their peers when their teachers liked them. Although physical aggression was most strongly associated with rejection among boys whose teachers liked them, relational aggression predicted popularity among boys whose teachers disliked them. Results suggest that teacher preferences may be a particularly important factor contributing to both physically and relationally aggressive children's social status (e.g., rejection and popularity), especially for girls.

The high impact segment (27.1%) recommended uniforms, mandatory recess activities, four playground supervisors, surveillance cameras, and 4‐day suspensions when students bully. The moderate impact segment (49.5%) recommended discretionary uniforms and recess activities, four playground supervisors, and 3‐day suspensions. Involvement as a bully or bully‐victim was associated with membership in a low impact segment (23.4%) that rejected uniforms and surveillance cameras. They recommended fewer anti‐bullying activities, discretionary recess activities, fewer playground supervisors, and the 2‐day suspensions. Simulations predicted most students would recommend a program maximizing student involvement combining prevention with moderate consequences. The simulated introduction of mandatory uniforms, surveillance cameras, and long suspensions reduced overall support for a comprehensive program, particularly among students involved as bullies or bully‐victims.

However, more needs to be known about the development of antisocial behavior in adulthood and about factors that account for continuity and change. In this study, we investigated the developmental course into adulthood of different trajectories of antisocial behavior in childhood and adolescence. Second, we examined the role of developmental adaptation in emerging adulthood in accounting for the continuity and change of antisocial behavior. The participants (N = 162) were drawn from an ongoing 28-year longitudinal study. Trajectory groups (EOP: Early Onset/Persistent, n = 30; AO: Adolescent Onset, n = 32; Other, n = 100) were based on measures of externalizing behavior assessed at six time points in childhood and adolescence. Through interviews and questionnaires in adulthood, the quality of romantic relationships and the participants' work ethic (age 23), duration of unemployment (between ages 23 and 26 years), the level of externalizing problems (ages 23 and 26), and the number of antisocial personality disorder symptoms (age 28) were assessed. Results indicated that individuals in the EOP group showed the highest levels of antisocial behavior throughout emerging and early adulthood. Negative experiences in the work and romantic relationship domains was related to the continuity of antisocial behavior in the EOP group. For the AO group, a shorter duration of unemployment was related to lower levels of antisocial behavior. This study shows that early history plays an important role in the development of antisocial behavior and in the way developmental adaptation in emerging adulthood accounts for continuity and change of antisocial behavior.",

Using ecological and social capital theories, we explored the impact of positive and negative proximal processes, social capital, and contextual characteristics (i.e., school and neighborhood) on adolescent aggression. Data came from the Rural Adaptation Project, which is a 5‐year longitudinal panel study of more than 4,000 middle and high school students from 40 public schools in two rural, low income counties in North Carolina. A three‐level HLM model ( N = 4,056 at Wave 1, 4,251 at Wave 2, and 4,256 at Wave 3) was estimated to predict factors affecting the change trajectories of aggression. Results indicated that negative proximal processes in the form of parent‐adolescent conflict, friend rejection, peer pressure, delinquent friends, and school hassles were significant predictors of aggression. In addition, social capital in the form of ethnic identity, religious orientation, and school satisfaction served as buffers against aggression. Negative proximal processes were more salient predictors than positive proximal processes. School and neighborhood characteristics had a minimal impact on aggression. Overall, rates of aggression did not change significantly over the 3‐year study window.

However, it remains unclear if attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms exacerbate these relations, particularly in samples of children who are severely clinically distressed. The purpose of the present study was to test ADHD symptoms as a potential moderator of the relations of ODD symptoms to psychopathic traits (i.e., callous‐unemotional [CU] traits, narcissism) and to aggressive subtypes (i.e., proactive, reactive aggression) in a large sample of children in an acute psychiatric inpatient facility ( n = 699; ages 6–12). Multiple regression analyses indicated that, after controlling for child demographic variables, ADHD symptoms marginally exacerbated the relation between ODD symptoms and CU traits. Both ODD and ADHD symptoms had an additive, but not a multiplicative effect, in predicting narcissism. In addition, for a subset of the full sample for whom data were available ( n = 351), ADHD symptoms exacerbated the relation between ODD symptoms and both reactive and proactive aggression. These results suggest that ADHD symptoms tend to have a negative effect on the relation between ODD symptoms and markers of antisociality among children receiving acute psychiatric care. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Aggressive delinquency is a salient social problem for many North American Indigenous (American Indian, Canadian First Nations) communities, and can have deleterious consequences later in life. Yet there is a paucity of research on Indigenous delinquency. Group‐based trajectory modeling is used to prospectively examine trajectories of aggressive delinquency over the course of adolescence using data from 646 Indigenous adolescents from a single culture, spanning the ages of 10–19. Five aggression trajectory groups were identified, characterized by different levels and ages of onset and desistence: non‐offenders (22.1%), moderate desistors (19.9%), adolescent‐limited offenders (22.2%), high desistors (16.7%), and chronic offenders (19.2%). Using the social development model of antisocial behavior, we selected relevant risk and protective factors predicted to discriminate among those most and least likely to engage in more aggressive behavior. Higher levels of risk (i.e., parent rejection, delinquent peers, substance use, and early dating) in early adolescence were associated with being in the two groups with the highest levels of aggressive delinquency. Positive school adjustment, the only significant protective factor, was associated with being in the lowest aggression trajectory groups. The results provide important information that could be used in developing prevention and intervention programs, particularly regarding vulnerable ages as well as malleable risk factors. Identifying those youth most at risk of engaging in higher levels of aggression may be key to preventing delinquency and reducing the over‐representation of Indigenous youth in the justice system.

Participants were 61 children (9-13 years, M = 10.68, SD = 1.28; 48% male) drawn from a partially clinical sample who were assessed at two time points, approximately 12 months apart. At time 1, children were administered a battery of EF tests; adult reports of children's relational and physical victimization and use of relational and physical aggression were collected. At time 2, adult-reported aggression was re-collected. Regression analyses tested whether EF ability moderated the association between peer victimization and increased engagement in aggression. Form-specific (e.g., physical victimization predicting physical aggression) and cross-form (e.g., physical victimization predicting relational aggression) models were tested. EF moderated the association between physical victimization and increases in physical aggression over time and between relational victimization and increases in relational aggression over time. Physical victimization predicted increases in physical aggression only among children with poor EF. However, relational victimization predicted increases in relational aggression for children with good EF skills but decreases in relational aggression for children with poor EF skills. Interaction effects for cross-form models were not significant. Results suggest that there are distinct risk factors implicated in children's engagement in physical and relational aggression. Established cognitive vulnerability models for engagement in physical aggression should not be assumed to apply to engagement in relational aggression.",

    "abstract": "Perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV) represent a heterogeneous group who engage in a variety of aggressive acts which often co‐occur. However, few studies take this co‐occurrence into consideration. Failure to consider overlapping forms of IPV confounds understanding of risk factors for physical IPV, which in turn undermines identification, prevention, and intervention efforts. Though rarely studied in emerging adults, personality variables have recently been identified as important correlates of IPV. The primary aims of the current studies are to identify distinct subgroups of moderate and severe psychological and physical IPV and personality covariates of class membership. Two studies were conducted at different public regional universities in the northeast ( n = 500; n = 497). Both samples were about two‐thirds female, approximately one‐half White, one‐fifth Black, and one‐quarter Latino, of any race. Latent Class Analysis identified three subgroups in both studies: low, moderate, and severe IPV. The severe and moderate IPV groups included those who reported threats and moderate physical IPV while the severe IPV group also included those who engaged in severe and injurious forms of physical IPV. Multinomial regression analysis showed that impulsive aggression discriminated moderate and severe from low IPV (Study 1), and more frequent emotionally abusive and controlling behavior, a hostile‐dominant interpersonal style and trait aggression discriminated among all three groups, with severe IPV having the greatest likelihood of controlling behavior and aggression (Study 2). IPV is represented by distinct subgroups that vary by severity of IPV with different personality covariates. General aggressive and domineering tendencies in relationships characterize those engaging in severe IPV.",

    "abstract": "The most studied bimodal classifications of aggressive behavior are the impulsive/premeditated distinction measured with the Impulsive Premeditated Aggression Scale and the reactive/proactive distinction measured with the Reactive Proactive Questionnaire. The terms of these classifications are often used interchangeably, assuming that reactive aggression is equivalent to impulsive aggression and that proactive aggressive behavior is the same as premeditated aggression. The correspondence or discrepancy between both aggression classifications/questionnaires, however, is understudied. Therefore, the current study investigated the correspondence between the RPQ and IPAS in a sample of 161 forensic psychiatric outpatients (FPOs) with severe aggressive behavior. Correlation analysis revealed a limited correspondence between the RPQ and IPAS. Cluster analyses derived three clusters from the RPQ as well as the IPAS: these clusters did not match in 60.3% of the cases. Furthermore, the notion that the RPQ measures trait aggression whereas the IPAS assesses state aggression could not be verified. The present study indicates that aggression subtypes as measured by use of the RPQ and IPAS correspond only partially and should not be used interchangeably. Furthermore, it was suggested that RPQ focuses more on actual aggressive behavior and the IPAS more on emotions and their regulation. Future research is needed to elucidate the applicability of both questionnaires in further detail.",

We used regression models to estimate the odds ratios for those having alcohol and/or drug use disorder(s) perpetrating (a) each form of aggression compared with no aggression and (b) other‐directed compared with self‐directed aggression. Alcohol use disorder alone and drug use disorder(s) alone were both associated with significantly increased odds of committing self‐directed, other‐directed, and combined aggression. Individuals with drug use disorder(s) alone were more likely to commit other‐directed than self‐directed aggression (adjusted odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.04–2.05). Individuals with alcohol use disorder alone were not likely to commit one over the other (adjusted odds ratio = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.90–1.61). In conclusion, the integrated model of aggression based on the stress–diathesis model is a relevant framework to study risk factors for aggression. Further research is needed to identify longitudinal predictors of directionality of aggression.",

For example, adults low in HH have been found to exhibit higher levels of workplace delinquency and revenge motivation, and adolescent low in HH are more likely to bully others. However, there is a paucity of research examining this relationship in children and youth, and how these relationships develop over time. The current study addressed these gaps in the literature by assessing whether HH and impulsivity are independently associated with aggression in children Grades 3 through 8 ( N = 1201). Using data from the two waves of a longitudinal project, autoregressive crossed‐lagged path analysis was used to examine the bidirectional relationships between HH, impulsivity, and aggression over a 1‐year period. Results revealed significant bidirectional relationships between HH and aggression, such that lower scores of HH at Time 1 were associated with higher scores of aggression at Time 2 and vice versa. Similarly, higher scores of impulsivity at Time 1 were associated with higher scores of aggression at Time 2 and vice versa. In addition, these relationships were strongest in boys and at higher ages. Consistent with research in other populations, these results indicate that low HH and high impulsivity are linked to aggression in children and youth. Further, our results demonstrate that HH and impulsivity bidirectionally impact aggression as one age, suggesting a need for early intervention.",

The 243 participants were approximately 12 years old and ethnically diverse. Neither intimate exchange nor reciprocity significantly moderated friend influence on aggression in a simple way, but the interaction of intimate exchange and friendship reciprocity predicted peer influence on participants’ aggression over time. Specifically, highly intimate, nonreciprocal best friendships and less intimate, reciprocal best friendships showed greatest influence when friends’ proportion of peer nominations for aggression was high.

    "abstract": "Aggressive driving behavior is an important cause of traffic accidents. Based on the recent view that aggressive driving is one way that trait aggression manifests itself, a growing research area has focused on the development of scales to assess aggressive driving. The aggressive driving scale (ADS) analyzed in the present study consists of 24 items. A sample of 276 participants was analyzed to obtain the factor structure and reliability of the ADS and 67 of them participated in the behavioral experiment in order to examine the construct and predictive validity of the scale. Results indicated a 3‐factor structure (interference with other drivers, violations/risk taking, and anger/aggression expression behavior) with high item loadings. The ADS had high internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Construct validity of the ADS was established as the ADS subscale scores correlated significantly with trait measures of anger and aggression. Predictive validity of the ADS was verified as most items were significantly correlated with behavioral measures derived from a driving simulator. The ADS was a significant predictor of behavioral measures both in the simulated environment (i.e., frequency of driving off the road, red light running behavior, frequency of colliding with a vehicle, frequency and distance of over speeding, frequency and distance of central crossing) and reported real world situations (i.e., annual moving violations and accidents). These results suggest that the ADS is a reliable and valid tool in evaluating aggressive driving behavior as the current study provides behavioral support for the effectiveness of the ADS in measuring aggressive driving behavior.

Female undergraduate psychology students from 12 countries (Armenia, Australia, England, Egypt, Finland, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Scotland, Trinidad) indicated which of 47 intrusive activities they considered to be unacceptable. Responses were compared with parasite-stress values, a measure of global gender equality and Hofstede's dimensions of national cultures. There was no unanimous agreement on any of the items, even for those relating to forced sexual violence. Cluster analysis yielded four clusters: \"Aggression and surveillance\" (most agreement that the constituent items were unacceptable), \"Unwanted attention,\" \"Persistent courtship and impositions,\" and \"Courtship and information seeking\" (least agreement that the constituent items were unacceptable). There were no significant relationships between the \"Aggression and surveillance\" or \"Courtship and information seeking\" clusters and the measure of gender equality, Hofstede's dimensions of national cultures or the measure of parasite stress. For the \"Unwanted attention\" and \"Persistent courtship and impositions\" clusters, women residing in countries with higher gender inequality and higher parasite-stress were less accepting of behavior associated with uncommitted sexual relations, and women in more individualistic societies with higher levels of gender equality were less accepting of monitoring activities. Culture may take precedence over personal interpretations of the unacceptability of intrusive behavior that is not obviously harmful or benign in nature.",

Conversely, people with aggressive dispositions (e.g., intermittent explosive disorder) are at greater risk for subsequent substance abuse. Yet it remains unknown why aggression might promote subsequent alcohol use. Both aggressive acts and alcohol use are rewarding and linked to greater activity in neural reward circuitry. Through this shared instantiation of reward, aggression may then increase subsequent alcohol consumption. Supporting this mechanistic hypothesis, participants’ aggressive behavior directed at someone who had recently rejected them, was associated with more subsequent beer consumption on an ad‐lib drinking task. Using functional MRI, both aggressive behavior and beer consumption were associated with greater activity in the bilateral ventral striatum during acts of retaliatory aggression. These results imply that aggression is linked to subsequent alcohol abuse, and that a mechanism underlying this effect is likely to be the activation of the brain's reward circuitry during aggressive acts.",

The results also showed that interaction between parental practices and some child temperament traits predicted overt aggression (coercion and lack of supervision associated with extraversion or low effortful control) or indirect aggression (coercion and neglect associated with negative affect or low effortful control), and the absence of a father figure predicted high indirect aggression in girls.",

It is associated with a variety of adverse social and behavioral outcomes. Numerous observational studies have found that depressed individuals have significantly elevated rates of interpersonal violence. As of now, the social mechanisms that explain the association between depression and violence remain understudied and not well understood. Drawing on the aggression and social psychology literatures, we argue that depressed actors suffer skills deficits and exhibit hostile communication styles that provoke grievances and disputes. We suggest that, because of these interpersonal tendencies, depression increases involvement in verbal disputes, and that frequent participation in verbal disputes foments social contexts where interpersonal violence is more common. Findings from a series of regression models based on a nationally representative sample of 2171 respondents offer support for our assumptions. The study suggests a consideration of interpersonal dynamics, particularly verbal disputes, might unlock clues about the association between depression and violence involvement.",

This study investigates the role of soldiers' levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and appetitive aggression, that is, a lust for violence, for their engaging in violence during deployment. Furthermore, factors during deployment influencing the level of PTSD symptoms and appetitive aggression after deployment were examined for a better comprehension of the maintenance of violence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 468 Burundian soldiers before and after a 1-year deployment to Somalia. To predict violent acts during deployment (perideployment) as well as appetitive aggression and PTSD symptom severity after deployment (postdeployment), structural equation modeling was utilized. Results showed that the number of violent acts perideployment was predicted by the level of appetitive aggression and by the severity of PTSD hyperarousal symptoms predeployment. In addition to its association with the predeployment level, appetitive aggression postdeployment was predicted by violent acts and trauma exposure perideployment as well as positively associated with unit support. PTSD symptom severity postdeployment was predicted by the severity of PTSD avoidance symptoms predeployment and trauma exposure perideployment, and negatively associated with unit support. This prospective study reveals the importance of appetitive aggression and PTSD hyperarousal symptoms for the engagement in violent acts during deployment, while simultaneously demonstrating how these phenomena may develop in mutually reinforcing cycles in a war setting.",

These studies, however, have used forced‐choice paradigms, in which a pair of masculinized and feminized faces was presented side by side. These studies are susceptible to demand characteristics, because participants may be able to draw the conclusion that faces which appear more masculine should be rated as more dominant. To prevent this, we tested if dominance could be perceived when masculinized or feminized faces were presented individually for only 100 ms. We predicted higher dominance ratings to masculinized faces and better memory of them in a surprise recognition memory test. In the experiment, 96 men rated the physical dominance of 40 facial photographs (masculinized = 20, feminized = 20), which were randomly drawn from a larger set of faces. This was followed by a surprise recognition memory test. Half of the participants were assigned to a condition in which the contours of the facial photographs were set to an oval to control for sexual dimorphism in face shape. Overall, men assigned higher dominance ratings to masculinized faces, suggesting that they can appraise differences in facial sexual dimorphism following very brief exposure. This effect occurred regardless of whether the outline of the face was set to an oval, suggesting that masculinized internal facial features were sufficient to affect dominance ratings. However, participants' recognition memory did not differ for masculinized and feminized faces, which could be due to a floor effect.",

The odds for using e‐cigarettes increased each step of being bullied from “never,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” “once a week,” to “several times a week” by 2.03 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.81, 2.29) in the unadjusted model, and by 1.46 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.71) in the covariate‐adjusted model. Data indicate an empirical association between victimization and e‐cigarette use among German students. Design limitations prevent the conclusion of a causal relationship, calling for well‐designed longitudinal studies to investigate the temporal sequence between victimization and e‐cigarette use.",

The participants in Study 1 were 139 young adults from the UK (76 women; Mage = 20.8). In Study 2, 88 young adult women from the UK (Mage = 21.5) served as participants. The participants completed a standardized measure of trust beliefs in others (total with reliability, honesty, and emotional subscales). In Study 1, participants imagined they were victims of peer provocation. They were required to judge the intention for the provocation and their retaliation to it. In Study 2, the participants were engaged in a lab‐based acquaintanceship interaction that involved the exchange of disclosures. They completed an adjective checklist that assessed anger and evaluated the quality of the conversation. Trust beliefs were linearly and negatively associated with the attribution of hostile intentions, retaliation, anger toward others, and critical evaluation of a developing peer relationship. As expected though, quadratic relations were found. Young adults with very low and those with very high trust beliefs (primarily emotionally based) showed greater attribution of hostile intentions, retaliation, anger toward others, and critical evaluation of a developing peer relationship than did young adults with the middle range of trust beliefs. The linear relations supported the hypothesis that trust promotes psychosocial adjustment. The quadratic relations supported the deviation from the normative trust (centralist) approach primarily for emotional trust beliefs in others.",

Physical, relational, and cyber aggression often occur simultaneously but may exhibit heterogeneous developmental patterns. We aimed to identify heterogeneous co-developmental patterns of physical, relational, and cyber peer aggression and to investigate the contributions of victimization experiences to co-developmental trajectories. Participants were 2869 elementary school students (56.2% boys), initially in fourth grade (Mage = 10.51 years) in China. Longitudinal data on peer aggression were collected from participants semiannually for 2 years. Data on victimization experiences were collected in the initial measurement wave. Parallel process latent curve growth modeling produced four co-developmental trajectories of peer aggression: High Desisting group, Moderate-Increasing group, Moderate-Physical and Relational Aggression group, and Low Stable group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that childhood emotional abuse, psychological maltreatment by teachers, as well as physical peer victimization, and cyber peer victimization, served as risk factors for severe co-developmental trajectories. The findings highlight the co-development of physical, relational, and cyber aggression. The identification of risk factors for co-developmental trajectories points to the need for continued monitoring and protection from ongoing victimization experiences in the family and school settings to prevent or ameliorate aggressive behavior.",

    "abstract": "People typically have a strong bias in attention toward faces to help them understand social interactions. Nonetheless some people, like incarcerated offenders and psychopaths, exhibit deficits in \"face reading,\" which may impair their interpretations, especially in case of attribution allocation in harmful events. In these cases, the ascription of intentionality is key in understanding the allocation of blame and structuring social information processing. Consequently, in the current study, in addition to typically studied intentionality and blame ascription levels (subfactors of hostile attributions), we also propose a new indicator of hostile attributions: intentionality/blame isomorphism, indicating reduced differentiation between those two factors. Violent prison inmates (N = 63) and community-based adults without previous history of incarceration (N = 63) took part in an eye-tracking study. In line with our hypotheses, offenders exhibited reduced attention orienting to faces as well as greater intentionality/blame isomorphism. In the case of both groups, people looked longer at the faces of the harm doer compared with the harm receiver. Additionally, greater intentionality/blame isomorphism predicted reduced attention to faces; however, when group status was included in the model, it became the only significant predictor of the attention to faces. Future studies should examine the origins of these gaze and attribution patterns and investigate consequences related to social perception and interactions of people prone to violence.",

Relative to the active control group, SCT did not reduce aggression regardless of the training duration. We also did not find supportive evidence to suggest that theoretically relevant variables mediated or moderated the effects of SCT on aggression over time. Bayesian analyses showed greater support for the null hypotheses than the alternative hypothesis. Our experiment casts doubt on the long‐term effectiveness of using SCT for reducing reactive aggression.

The sample included seventh, eigth, and ninth graders ( N = 3225) (51.2% girls, 37.2% with an immigrant background) from 36 Swiss and German schools who completed a survey about hate speech, social dominance orientation, empathy, and moral disengagement. A multilevel mediation path model revealed that social dominance orientation had a direct effect on offline and online hate speech perpetration. Moreover, social dominance also had indirect effects via low levels of empathy and high levels of moral disengagement. No gender differences were observed.

To reach this goal, intercrosses were made between two selection lines for attack latency (SAL and LAL) and their congenic strains (SAL. LY and LAL. SY). This procedure resulted in F1 hybrids that carried the same autosomes, but differed in their X chromosome and the two different parts of their Y chromosomes, the different parts of the Y chromosome being a recombining part called the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) and a non-recombining part (non-PAR). We conclude that both parts of the Y chromosome contribute slightly but significantly to variation in aggression. The major effect is accomplished by the PAR of the aggressive parent; a mirror effect is achieved by the non-PAR of the aggressive parent in interaction with the PAR. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Physical harm and property damage items were used in a structured interview format. There were 90 subjects drawn from three elementary school grades (2nd, 4th, and 6th). Children differentiated between the expected and prescribed responses of peers and significant developmental differences in children's evaluations were found. Although the majority of the subjects in all grades denounced retaliation on the basis of concerns about others' welfare, older children stated that peers were likely to retaliate against the perpetrator nonetheless. Across different contexts, older children's responses appeared to reveal a greater independence from authority in negotiating peer interactions. In evaluating the witness's responses to aggressive acts, younger children's expected and prescribed responses were less disparate than that of the older children. The utility of including different vantage points of the child in examining children's social reasoning about aggression and the application of the present findings to social information-processing models are discussed. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In Experiment 1, both members of eight pairs of solitary-housed juvenile rats received either vehicle, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg fluoxetine in a counterbalanced within-subject design 20 min before being allowed to play for 5 min periods on four successive test days. The 5 and 10 mg/kg pretreatments significantly reduced incidence of pins during play without affecting dorsal contacts. In Experiment 2, one member of each of 19 established play pairs received 5 mg/kg fluoxetine 20 min before play, while the other member received vehicle. Dominant rats showed no reduction in pins as a result of fluoxetine treatment, but subordinate rats who received fluoxetine exhibited significant reductions in pins. Subsequent dyadic analyses indicated that in pairs where the subordinate animal received fluoxetine, dominant animals maintained their pinning advantage over the 10 days of testing, but in pairs where the dominant animals received fluoxetine, this pinning asymmetry diminished. In Experiment 3, we replicated the above procedure with inexperienced play pairs, to control for the effects of prior social learning. Fluoxetine treatment (5 mg/kg) significantly reduced both pins and dorsal contacts in all treated rats. The results indicate that fluoxetine can reduce the playful pins of juvenile rats, but that prior social learning mediates the strength of these effects. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

An Italian version of Olweus [(1991): Erlbaum] and Whitney and Smith's [(1993): Educational Research 35:3–25] questionnaire on bullying was employed to select 64 bullies, 40 victims, and 101 controls from a wider sample of students aged 11, 12, and 13 years. Six stories dealing with themes of social interaction between two peers were chosen as the task of the study. These stories described an episode in which the protagonist carried out an act that violated his/her normal behaviour toward the peer. Three stories ended in negative violating acts and three ended in positive ones. Students were asked to try to imagine what had happened prior to the act and how the peer would react to such an act. Dependent variables were locus of attribution of the antecedents to the protagonist or to the environment; use of verbs indicating actions or mental events; and Aggressive, Prosocial, or Neutral reaction of the peer. Two main results were found: (1) two main strategies of answer differentiated bullies and victims: bullies—more frequently than victims—used a Protagonist-Mental strategy in which stories were mainly completed using antecedents consisting of mental states of the protagonist, while victims—more frequently than bullies—used an Environment-Action strategy, in which stories were mainly completed using, as antecedents, other people's actions toward the protagonist; and (2) bullies were more similar to the control group than victims were.

The mean blood ethanol level at the time of arrest was 33.3 ± 2.6 mM. Serum testosterone levels were significantly lower and cortisol levels higher at the time of police intervention (within 1 hour of the incident) compared to control data collected later from the subjects when sober. Offenders did not differ from a group of nonviolent pub patrons at similar blood ethanol levels (35.9 ± 4.5 mM) with respect to serum testosterone, cortisol, or glucose, but their sober state cortisol and glucose concentrations were significantly higher compared to a control group of nonalcoholic men. Intoxication or acute hormonal changes were thus not specifically associated with violent behaviour. Provocative cues, however, may have been more frequent in the offender families, as Straus Conflict Tactics data showed that offenders and victims resorted to verbal aggression significantly more often than control families. The significantly elevated cortisol and glucose concentrations in offenders when sober compared to nonviolent controls could be viewed as direct effects of life stress, or as indirect effects of stress mediated by learned escape drinking.

    "abstract": "The effects of four novel odors on risk assessment by mice (i. e., flat back approach, stretched attention, immobility) and the suppression of appetitive behaviors were examined in two experiments. When novel odors were presented in a straight runway, subjects spent significantly less time in the odor compartment, relative to controls, when it contained sheep wool, chocolate, or citronella (but not cat fur) odors. Risk assessment behaviors occurred at similar levels among all groups and appetitive behaviors were not suppressed by the novel odors. When odorants were scattered over one half of the subjects' home cage floor in Experiment 2, all novel odors increased the duration of at least on e risk assessment measure and/or suppressed appetitive behaviors (i. e., eating, grooming, rearing). The results clearly reveal that a reasonably wide range of novel odors evoke at least some level of risk assessment which presumably reflects increased fearfulness. The odors of sheep wool and cat fur induced a wider range of such responses than did chocolate or cinnamon suggesting that mammalian odors may be particularly effective stimuli. If so, however, it is clear that predator odors are not uniquely effective in this regard. Experiment 1 also underscores the importance of the testing environment in assessing the behavioral effects of novel odors in mice. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "“Priming” a female hamster by allowing it a single attack on an intruder placed into its home cage transiently decreases the latency and increases the probability of attack on a second trial. Although we have previously argued that this priming effect reflects an increase in aggressive arousal, an alternative interpretation is that the fear elicited by placing a foreign object into the subject's home cage is reduced when it happens again on the second trial. Another interpretation is that priming is an effect of intruder novelty, i.e., the subject perceives a difference between the first and second intruders which causes it to attack the second more quickly. Experiment 1 compared the standard two trial paradigm with different intruders to trials in which (1) the first intruder was withdrawn and used again in the second trial, and (2) the intruder remained in the cage following the first attack. All intruders were pretreated with the analgesic-sedative methotrimeprazine to reduce the variability of their behavior. Neither hypothesis tested in Experiment 1 was supported, strengthening the interpretation of attack priming as a manipulation that affects primarily internal motivational mechanisms specific to aggression. Allowing a hamster to carry out a protracted series of attacks produces a “satiation” effect that is the reverse of priming, i.e., the latency of a subsequent attack is increased and its probability reduced. It is possible that the attack satiation observed in our earlier studies was not the result of processes internal to the subject, but could have been due to habituation to a particular intruder or to certain stimuli emitted by it during the protracted interaction. In Experiment 2 subjects were given three sessions of 10 successive trials using either 1 intruder presented repeatedly, 2 intruders presented alternately, or 10 different intruders presented once each. No difference among conditions was found in this study either suggesting that subject's aggressive behavior is insensitive to whatever changes may occur in intruders' behavior or other stimulus characteristics when they have been treated with methotrimeprazine. The lack of differences among test conditions in both experiments is most likely due to the efficacy of the drug in “standardizing” intruder behavior. Experiment 2 also revealed an interesting difference in two measures of attack latency. The time elapsing between intruder presentation and attack, i.e., the standard measure of latency, decreased from the first to the fourth trail; it then increased steadily over the remaining trials. The cumulative time that the subject remained in contact with the intruder prior to attack, a measure more indicative of attention to the intruder, dropped to an asymptotic value by the second trial. This difference suggests that the satiation effect may be accounted for by subjects' increasing avoidance of the intruders over trails, perhaps as a way of regualting their level of aggressive arousal.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Severe aggression within groups of male laboratory mice can cause serious welfare problems. Previous experiments have shown that the transfer of specific olfactory cues during cage cleaning and the provision of nesting material decrease aggression and stress in group‐housed male mice. In this study, the combined effect of these husbandry procedures was tested for their long‐term effect on aggression in two strains of male mice (BALB/c and CD‐1). We used postcleaning aggressive behavior, wound counts, and testosterone levels as indicators of aggressiveness. Physiological responses to social challenge were investigated through urinary corticosterone and adrenal tyrosine‐hydroxylase measurements. Furthermore, the aggression‐modulating effects of two enrichment items (ShepherdShack/DesRes and PVC tube) were explored. Marked differences were found between the two strains. CD‐1 mice were more aggressive, had higher testosterone levels but lower corticosterone levels, and had fewer wounds than BALB/c mice. However, in neither of the two strains was long‐term enrichment with nesting material and its transfer after cage cleaning effective in lasting reduction of intermale aggression. This may be explained by the fact that aggression levels were generally low. It seems that housing mice in small, socially stable groups or keeping social disturbances to a minimum considerably modulates aggression in group‐housed male mice. Mice of both strains housed in cages enriched with nesting material had lower urinary corticosterone levels than standard‐housed mice. We therefore conclude that the long‐term provision of nesting material, including the transfer of nesting material during cage cleaning, may enhance the welfare of laboratory mice. Aggr.

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to assess the effects of resident versus intruder size differences upon the territorial prior-residence effect and level of territorial aggression in convict cichlids. Prior to a direct territorial dominance encounter, pairs of fish were randomly composed for one of three experimental treatment conditions: 1) the resident having a body-length 20–30% larger than that of the intruder, 2) the intruder having a body-length 20–30% larger than the resident, or 3) the combatants' body-lengths differing by no more than 5%. After a 3-day territorial acclimation period in their individual territories, the subject designated as the intruder was introduced to the resident's territory. For each encounter the pairmember that attacked first and the one that ultimately established dominance were recorded. Also measured during the encounter were the total number of bites, resident bites, intruder bites, and jaw-locking frequency and duration. The results revealed that there was a significant resident advantage in the resident-larger group. The intruder-larger group resulted in a significant intruder dominance advantage. However, no significant dominance advantage occurred in the same-size group. As predicted by game theory, there was significantly less escalation of aggression in contests in which one combatant held both designated asymmetric cues (prior residence, size) than in contests in which one combatant had prior residence, or when these two asymmetric cues were divided between the pairmembers. The size asymmetry is more important in determining dominance than the prior-residence asymmetry, for the particular size-difference range selected in the present study.",

During interviews, 56 participants (ages 8.0 to 14.5) living in poor and violent neighborhoods in urban Colombia narrated 128 recent conflicts they had with, or observed among, peers. Third parties were present in 73%, and actively involved in 65%, of the conflicts. Most commonly, peers supported one side, teachers used repressive means to promote settlements, and parents took over their children's conflicts. Virtually all the participants mentioned ways of promoting a settlement, but only a fraction used them in actual conflicts. Mediation was absent among peer or adult third parties. Third parties' emotions were less intense than those of main parties, suggesting that it might be easier for bystanders to use cognitive capacities acquired through educational interventions promoting peaceful relationships.

The current research borrows a methodology from social cognition work to examine the role of passive, category accessibility effects on fan hostility. Prior research has indicated that as a schema becomes more accessible in memory, the use of it to encode subsequent information is increased. It was therefore hypothesized that individuals for whom the category of hostility had been unobtrusively primed with aggressive-sports names (e.g., boxing) would rate an ambiguous target person as more hostile and as more likely to prefer hostile activities relative to persons who were primed with sports names which were not associated with violence (e.g., golf). The results supported the hypotheses, with subjects who were primed with aggressive-sports rating an unrelated target person's behavior as significantly more hostile and as more likely to prefer aggressive activities relative to subjects exposed to sentences containing references to nonaggressive-sports. Discussion includes the potential ramifications for spectator aggression at sporting events.",

    "abstract": "Agonistic interactions between adult domestic rabbit females were observed. Females were housed in groups of four in outdoor enclosures measuring 4 × 4 m. Agonistic patterns included aggression (AG), flight (FL), and submission (SB). Observations focused on 1) initial interactions between unfamiliar females, concomitant with the formation and establishment of a social structure (Phase 1); and 2) interactions between familiar females organized in a stable social structure (Phase 2). AG was frequent between unfamiliar females and appeared related to the acquisition of social dominance. When social organization was settled, there was a dramatic reduction in the number and frequency of aggressive behaviors. Similarly, FL was more frequent when females were unfamiliar, but it did not appear to be merely a response to AG. The decreased frequency of both AG and FL in Phase 2 was paralleled by an increased frequency of SB with respect to FL. Under stable social conditions, subordinate females frequently signalled submission to dominant counterparts. In contrast, the latter did not signal their social status with any consistent behavioral pattern. It follows that SB was not necessarily induced as the appropriate response to aggression given by dominant females. Thus, SB appeared relevant in social communication especially in structured groups, where it conveyed information on the actor's subordination and possibly inhibited the receiver's aggression. A further possibility is that it has an autonomous rather than secondary role in the maintenance of stable dominance/subordination relationships.",

Among uptake inhibitors, although fluoxetine has a higher IC50 and a higher Ki, it is apparently more efficient than indalpine. The 5-HT agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, acting at a putative 5-HT1A receptor, appears more efficient on muricidal inhibition than 5-MeODM, at a much lower dosage. It is highly probable that 5-HT1A receptor rather than 5-HT1B is involved in the antimuricidal effect of serotonin-mimetic drugs. Since 5-HT mimetic drugs blocked mouse-killing behavior of bulbectomized rats, we suggest that in the sequence of events in muricidal inhibition 5-HT circuits participate after gabaergic modulation from olfactory bulbs.",

Bilateral thermal lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex resulted in an enhancement of aggression (experiment 1), evident from higher scores for lateral threat and keeping down. The prefrontal cortex is one of the very few cortical areas to receive a dopaminergic innervation. When dopamine was depleted by means of local infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the orbitofrontal cortex, similar behavioral changes were recorded (experiment 2).

The effects of trait rumination on men and women's emotional and aggressive responses under different cueing contexts were examined. Aggressive behavior, not resulting from direct insult or provocation, was indexed by a laboratory paradigm that measured the intensity and the duration of shocks delivered to a putative \"employee\". Frustration about, and cognitive focus on, the employee's poor performance was manipulated through the cover story and procedures; however, half the participants were exposed to a fearful/distracting stressor (stress focused) whereas the other half were not (confederate focused). Emotional responses and evaluations of the confederate were also assessed. Results indicated that rumination enhanced the effects of context, so that it related to greater fear and sadness in the stress-focused context and to increased aggression and motives to aggress in the confederate-focused context. These effects, however, were more robust for women than men. Ruminative men tended to show more hostile behaviors and motives across both conditions.

We found seasonal patterns to be the most important correlates of aggressive behavior. Habitat was a modulating influence, and time of day was the least important factor. Rates of aggression were generally higher per male monkey than per female. In terms of total aggression recorded, however, females instigated significantly more than males, both in encounters between monkeys and in aggression against other species.

The Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scales (IPAS) were used to characterize aggressive behavior as predominantly impulsive or predominantly premeditated in nature. Analyses indicated that participants who did not respond to PHT treatment endorsed significantly more premeditated characteristics on the IPAS than those who responded to PHT treatment. Non-responders also exhibited fewer aggressive outbursts during placebo treatment, suggesting a greater level of behavior control. Participants who did not complete the study were younger, endorsed significantly more premeditated aggression characteristics and reported more lifetime antisocial behaviors than those who completed the study. Taken together, these data emphasize several factors that may influence the success of pharmacological treatment in aggressive individuals, namely the importance of characterizing the predominant type of problem aggressive behavior.

Additionally, they were more likely to endorse the use of aggression against a story character who feels happy rather than sad when bad things happen to other kids. These findings suggest that, as early as preschool, trait-relevant information about other people can serve as a tool with which children evaluate the appropriateness of aggression in response to ambiguous behavior.

It was also hypothesized that careful examination of intraindividual curves would identify a significant number of individuals growing from normal to clinical levels of overt antisocial behavior.

Regression analyses found that current single parenthood ratios were strongly and consistently predictive of violent crimes whereas single parenthood ratios 18 years earlier were not and this conclusion remained following controls for income inequality and the population sex ratio.

The current study of 335 children (209 boys, 126 girls), aged 4‐, 5‐, 6‐, and 9‐years, examined a different facet of harmful physical aggression–the development of the pleasure it provides to boys. Two samples of children were included, first 89 boys, then an additional 120 boys and 126 girls. For the first two free response measures, all 209 boys and 126 girls were asked to describe how they played with their three favorite toys and their three favorite playmates, and these descriptions were coded for the presence of physical aggression. Twelve additional structured measures were administered to the second sample of 120 boys and 126 girls. These children were asked to rate how much they enjoyed enacting and viewing on television physical aggression, non‐physically aggressive male sex‐typed roles, and ambiguously sex‐typed roles. Results demonstrated that approximately 50% of boys at all four age levels (and less than 10% of girls) reported that at least one of their three favorite toys was used for inflicting harm through physical aggression on an animate being. Further, with increasing age, boys rated physical aggression in play activities and on television as more enjoyable than alternative male sex‐typed play and television content. Results suggest that advancing understanding of the development of physical aggression requires acknowledging the pleasure it provides to males. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Research aimed at identifying and studying subtypes of aggression have historically dichotomized aggressive subtypes, although specific nomenclature has varied; one approach has been to classify aggressive behavior as predominantly impulsive or predominantly premeditated. There are a number of behavioral and cognitive differences between those exhibiting these different forms of aggression. This study was designed to extend understanding of the impulsive/premeditated aggression dichotomy by comparing time estimation among adolescents exhibiting predominantly impulsive or predominantly premeditated forms of physical aggression who have a psychiatric diagnosis of conduct disorder (CD). Time estimation has previously been shown to be disrupted in impulsive and some aggressive individuals. Time estimation was compared between healthy Controls ( n = 37) and two groups of adolescents with CD, those with histories of either predominantly impulsive (CD‐Impulsive, n = 26) or predominantly premeditated (CD‐Premeditated, n = 38) aggressive behaviors. Participants completed five computerized trials during which they estimated when 1 min had passed. Among aggressive adolescents with CD, the misperception of time was specific to those with histories of impulsive aggression, although time estimates improved with repeated testing and performance feedback. This study confirms the importance of considering the role and type of physical aggression when studying heterogeneous diagnostic groups like CD and supports the relevance of time estimation to certain subgroups of adolescents with CD.

Undergraduates at six Canadian universities ( N = 1,232) read three vignettes describing conflict situations with social environmental manipulations while imagining themselves as either sober or intoxicated. Self‐ratings assessed likelihood of assertive and aggressive responses and motivational indices of anger, offensiveness of the instigator's actions, and importance to respond to the provocation. Respondents also completed a measure of trait aggression. Multi‐group structural equation models supported the hypothesis that perceived likelihood of reactive aggression is influenced by perceived alcohol intoxication, gender, trait aggression, social environmental factors, and motivation to respond to the provocation. In addition, a number of interactions were found among the predictors. These results provide insight into the types of factors that may influence aggression in drinking situations. Aggr.

The findings, which were consistent with the analysis of Berkowitz (1974) and Turner and Simons (1974), indicated that the weapons-no weapons comparison was significant only for non-apprehensive, nonaware subjects.

This review accomplishes two goals. First, it applies a theoretically and empirically based taxonomy to behaviors assessed by existing measurement instruments. Second, it evaluates whether the taxonomy provides a common language for the field. Strengths of the taxonomy include its ability to describe and categorize all forms of aggression found in existing quantitative measures. The taxonomy also classifies numerous examples of aggression discussed in the literature but notably absent from quantitative measures. Although we use existing quantitative measures as a starting place to evaluate the taxonomy, its use is not limited to quantitative methods.

    "abstract": "Abstract Violence was shown to be qualitatively different from functional hyper‐aggression in mice selected for high aggression namely Short Attack Latency (SAL), Turku Aggressive (TA) and North Carolina (NC900) strains. This study aimed at investigating whether this adulthood violent phenotype as seen previously in the SAL mice is fixed and hence behaviorally inflexible right from day 1 of the experiment or consequential , i.e., subject to gradual change from functional aggression to violence. The functionally hyper‐aggressive strains namely TA and NC900 strains served as controls for the study. Methodologically, behavioral (in)flexibility was studied using the overall sequential structure of agonistic behavior. In particular, intra‐individual variations in the overall agonistic behavior as well as offensive, pre‐ and post‐offensive behavior transitions, directly related to the resident–intruder interactions were investigated. The SAL mice showed the least intra‐individual variation in their overall sequential agonistic structure as well as a fixed offense‐oriented agonistic behavior of highest magnitude when compared with the other strains. Additionally, the pre‐ and post‐ offensive transitions were most salient in the functionally hyper‐aggressive TA and NC900 strains, whereas virtually absent in the SAL mice. Thus, the violent behavior of the adult SAL mice is behaviorally inflexible or fixed , whereas the functionally hyper‐aggressive behavior of the adult TA and NC900 mice is behaviorally flexible and constantly adaptive to the opponent behavior, over 3 days of repeated resident–intruder interaction.

Furthermore, most prior studies have focused on risk factors of aggression in men and have largely ignored this issue in women. Two samples ( n = 104; n = 99) of young adult women completed measures of resting heart rate, sensation seeking, and aggression. Across the two samples of females there was no evidence for the relationships of baseline heart rate with sensation seeking or with aggression that has been consistently shown in males. Boredom susceptibility and disinhibition subscales of sensation seeking were consistently significantly correlated with aggression. The lack of significance and the small effect sizes indicate that other mechanisms are also at work in affecting aggression in young adult women. Finally, it is important to consider the type of sensation seeking in relation to aggression, as only boredom susceptibility and disinhibition were consistently replicated across samples. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with aggressive behavior in veterans, and difficulty controlling aggressive urges has been identified as a primary postdeployment readjustment concern. Yet only a fraction of veterans with PTSD commit violent acts. The goals of this study were to (1) examine the higher‐order factor structure of Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) scales in a sample of U.S. military veterans seeking treatment for PTSD; and (2) to evaluate the incremental validity of higher‐order latent factors of the PAI over PTSD symptom severity in modeling aggression. The study sample included male U.S. Vietnam ( n = 433) and Iraq/Afghanistan ( n = 165) veterans who were seeking treatment for PTSD at an outpatient Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic. Measures included the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, the PAI, and the Conflict Tactics Scale. The sample was randomly split into two equal subsamples ( n 's = 299) to allow for cross‐validation of statistically derived factors. Parallel analysis, variable clustering analysis, and confirmatory factor analyses were used to evaluate the factor structure, and regression was used to examine the association of factor scores with self‐reports of aggression over the past year. Three factors were identified: internalizing, externalizing, and substance abuse. Externalizing explained unique variance in aggression beyond PTSD symptom severity and demographic factors, while internalizing and substance abuse did not. Service era was unrelated to reports of aggression. The constructs of internalizing versus externalizing dimensions of PTSD may have utility in identifying characteristics of combat veterans in the greatest need of treatment to help manage aggressive urges.

    "abstract": "In this study, formerly incarcerated men (N = 123) were assessed for their experiences with violence in the community as well as their current behavioral and mental health status (antisocial behavior and emotional distress). Participants also completed measures of two constructs theorized to moderate relations between exposure to violence and outcomes: cognitive beliefs supporting aggressive responding and negative emotional reactivity to witnessed violence. Data on key social-demographic background factors affecting outcomes were also collected. Analyses showed that, after controlling the effects of background factors, relationships between experiences with violence in the community and behavioral/mental health were moderated by cognitive beliefs and emotional reactivity. At high levels of support for aggressive responding, significant positive links were observed between exposure to violence and antisocial behavior as well as emotional distress. At high levels of negative reactivity to violence, a significant positive link was observed between exposure to violence and emotional distress (but not antisocial behavior). Findings are discussed with respect to research and theory on the effects of exposure to violence in high-risk adult populations.",

The present study aimed to test the prospective predictive impact of metacognitive beliefs and rumination on anger in a community sample. Seventy-six participants were recruited and engaged in a 2-week anger, rumination, and metacognitive beliefs monitoring protocol. A multi-wave panel design was employed to test whether metacognitive beliefs and rumination have a prospective impact on anger. Metacognitive beliefs and rumination were found to have a significant prospective impact on anger that was independent from the number of triggering events. Metacognitive beliefs about the need to control thoughts were shown to have a direct impact on subsequent anger, independently from rumination. These findings provide support for the potential value for applying metacognitive theory and therapy to anger-related problems. Aggr. Behav. 43:421-429, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The clumped distribution of food resources promotes food defensibility and can lead to the monopolizing of resources by high‐ranking individuals. However, the balance of power is set at different levels according to societies, meaning that resource partitioning should vary between them. This study investigates whether dominance asymmetry and resource partitioning are related in non‐human primates by comparing two species with contrasting social styles, namely rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) which display strong social intolerance and a steep gradient of dominance, and Tonkean macaques ( Macaca tonkeana ), which exhibit higher levels of tolerance and more balanced dominance relationships. Study groups were kept in semi‐free ranging conditions. Animals were provided with fruit in three different clumped conditions during 30‐min trials. We found that higher‐ranking rhesus macaques had priority for the access to fruit: these individuals spent longer in the feeding area in the first 10‐min period of trials, while lower‐ranking individuals had diminished access to fruit under the most clumped condition; this was associated with sustained agonistic interactions. Dominance effects were weaker in Tonkean macaques. They exhibited co‐feeding between high‐ and low‐ranking individuals in the first period; there was no significant effect of dominance even in the most clumped condition; and frequencies of agonistic interactions remained moderate relative to the number of individuals present in the feeding area. These results show that food resources were more equitably distributed among group members in tolerant macaques than in their intolerant counterparts. Dominance gradient and social tolerance may be considered as two aspects of the same phenomenon.",

Empirical research investigating such biases has so far focused on either the offense or the revenge act and may have confounded a perception bias with a situational selection bias (i.e., avengers and targets selecting different events in self‐serving ways, so that there may be actual , as opposed to perceptual, differences in severity). The current research circumvents this shortcoming by empirically investigating this perception bias by assessing avengers’ and targets’ severity scores of both the offense and the revenge act, and comparing these scores with severity scores of independent raters. Results show that although there is a situational selection bias, there is also a perception bias for both avengers and targets: Both avengers and targets believe that the other person's act is worse than their own act. This perception bias may explain the existence of perpetuating revenge cycles.",

Here we assessed the relationship between salivary testosterone and reactive aggression (i.e., rejection rate for unfair offers) in the Ultimatum Game. Forty naturally cycling women were tested twice, once in the late follicular phase (around ovulation) and once during the luteal phase. Ovulation was determined using urine test strips measuring luteinizing hormone levels. Salivary samples were assayed for testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol at both test sessions. There was no association with the cycle, but multilevel modeling revealed a significant within‐participant association between testosterone and rejection rate for extremely unfair offers (i.e., high reactive aggression), indicating that women showed greater reactive aggression when their testosterone levels were higher. Additionally, we found that women with relatively high individual concentrations of testosterone were more likely to reject extremely unfair offers than women with relatively low concentrations of testosterone. This study is the first to demonstrate that women react more aggressively in response to provocation when their testosterone level is high than when their testosterone is low, suggesting that testosterone plays an important role in the regulation of women's aggressive behavior following social provocation.",

In study 1, BMI, but not fWHR, positively predicted participants’ ratings of aggressiveness and fighting ability from facial photographs.

Further analyses revealed that the high BMI composite face was rated as more aggressive and tougher than the high fWHR composite face.

The current study examines coercive control , or behavior designed to constrain or compel an intimate partner in some way, in a longitudinal community sample of 98 heterosexual couples assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy as well as at 1 and 2 years postpartum. We found that the majority of couples reported at least some coercive controlling behavior during the transition to parenthood, that coercive control was highly bi‐directional between partners, and that women were more likely than men to engage in coercive control before parenthood. Using multilevel actor‐partner interdependence modeling, we found that women's coercive control predicted their own as well as men's perpetration of IPV across the transition to parenthood. Controlling for IPV perpetration by both partners, women's coercive control was longitudinally predictive of men's depression, harmful alcohol use, relationship dissatisfaction, poor co‐parenting, low perceived parenting competence, and perceptions of toddler problem behavior. Men's coercive control was longitudinally predictive of women's relationship dissatisfaction and parenting stress, as well as women's perceptions of infant problem behavior. Men's coercive control was associated with their own use of ineffective parenting behavior. These findings suggest that coercive control is common in community samples during the transition to parenthood and that coercive control predicts lower early family functioning.",

Self‐, peer, and teacher reports of victimization‐aggression networks ( who is victimized by whom ) were investigated in 25 Swiss kindergartens with 402 5‐ to 7‐years‐old. It was examined whether child characteristics (sex and parent‐reported internalizing and externalizing behavior) influence informant reports of victimization and/or aggression. Findings from statistical network models indicated higher concordance between self and peer reports than between one of these and teacher reports. Results further showed more agreement among informants on aggressors than on victims. Aggressors reported by self and peer reports were low on internalizing behavior, and aggressors reported by self and teacher reports were high on externalizing behavior; teacher‐reported victims were also high on externalizing behavior. Internalizing behavior was unrelated to victimization. According to self and peer reports, boys as well as girls were victimized by boys and girls equally; teachers reported less cross‐sex victimization than same‐sex victimization. The different views of teachers and children on victim‐aggressor relationships have implications for the identification of aggression in early childhood. Mutual sharing of information between children, their parents, peers, and teachers may contribute to signaling victims and aggressors in the early school years.",

However, the pathways between PTSD, depression, hostility, anger, and aggression have not been comprehensively characterized. Therefore, drawing on a sample of returning Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom combat veterans ( N = 175; 95% male; mean age 30 years), this study sought to examine the direct and indirect relationships among PTSD, depression, hostility, anger, and four types of aggression: verbal, and physical toward self, others, and objects. Functional modeling of direct effects was done using multiple least‐squares regression and bootstrapped mediation analyses were carried out to test indirect effects. Results indicate that PTSD is not the overall direct contributor to different forms of aggression, supporting the mediating role of depression and trait anger. Depression symptoms explain part of the relationships between PTSD and verbal aggression, physical aggression toward objects, and physical aggression toward self and trait anger explains part of the relationships between PTSD and verbal aggression, physical aggression toward objects, and physical aggression toward others. Our findings support the importance of assessing for anger, depression, and different types of aggression among veterans presenting for PTSD treatment to develop individualized treatment plans that may benefit from early incorporation of interventions.",

Disciplinary attitudes have been shown to mediate the association between disciplinary history and disciplinary responding. The present study investigated whether frustration influences these mediation effects. Half of a sample of 330 undergraduates was randomly assigned to frustration induction. Structural equation modeling confirmed that, for participants in the frustration condition, the relation between disciplinary history and physical discipline decision‐making was fully mediated by attitudes approving physical discipline. In contrast, for respondents in the no‐frustration condition, the pathway from disciplinary history to discipline decision‐making was only partially mediated by attitudes. Under conditions of frustration, attitudes may become a more central means by which personal disciplinary history is associated with disciplinary decision‐making. Aggr.

Little is known about the impact of deployment and combat exposure on violent behavior in Reservists. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of self-reported violent behavior among a representative sample of United Kingdom Reservists, the risk factors associated with violence and the impact of deployment and combat exposure on violence. This study used data from a large cohort study of randomly selected UK military personnel and included Reservists who were in service at the time of sampling (n = 1710). Data were collected by questionnaires that asked about socio-demographic and military characteristics, pre-enlistment antisocial behavior, deployment experiences, post-deployment mental health, and self-reported interpersonal violent behavior. The prevalence of violence among Reservists was 3.5%. Deployment was found to be a risk factor for violent behavior even after adjustment for confounders. The association with violence was similar for those deployed in either a combat role or non-combat role. Violence was also strongly associated with mental health risk factors (PTSD, common mental disorders, and alcohol misuse). This study demonstrated higher levels of self-reported post-deployment violence in UK Reservists who had served in either Iraq or Afghanistan. Deployment, irrespective of the role was associated with higher levels of violent behavior among Reservists. The results also emphasize the risk of violent behavior associated with post-deployment mental health problems. Aggr. Behav. 43:273-280, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Participants read a series of hypothetical conflict situation vignettes and responded to questionnaires to assess negative emotions and various facets of SIP including attributions for partner behavior, generation of response alternatives, and response selection. We conducted a series of negative binomial mixed-model regressions based on the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM; Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006, Dyadic data analysis. New York, NY: Guilford Press). There were significant results for the response generation and negative emotion models. Participants who generated fewer coping response alternatives were at greater risk of victimization (actor effect). Women were at greater risk of victimization if they had partners who generated fewer coping response alternatives (sex by partner interaction effect). Generation of less competent coping response alternatives predicted greater risk of perpetration among men, whereas generation of more competent coping response alternatives predicted greater risk of victimization among women (sex by actor interaction effects). Two significant actor by partner interaction effects were found for the negative emotion models. Participants who reported discrepant levels of negative emotions from their partners were at greatest risk of perpetration. Participants who reported high levels of negative emotions were at greatest risk of victimization if they had partners who reported low levels of negative emotions.

    "abstract": "Bullying is defined as repeated negative actions involving a power differential, and intention to harm. There is limited research on harmful intention as a definitional component. This study explored the role of the perpetrator's harmful intention and the target's perception of harmful intention. Some 209 students (M = 14.5 years; 66.5% female) and 447 parents (M = 46.4 years; 86.4% female) were randomly assigned in an online survey. Participants assessed the likelihood of bullying in five hypothetical scenarios (physical, verbal, rumor, exclusion, and cyber) across five intention conditions, that also involved repetition and a power differential. The five intention conditions were: 1) harm intended by perpetrator (I) and perceived as intended to harm by target (I) [II condition]; 2) harm not intended by perpetrator (N) but perceived as intended to harm by target (I) [NI condition]; 3) harm intended by perpetrator (I) but not perceived as intended to harm by target (N) [IN condition]; 4) harm not intended by perpetrator (N) and not perceived as intended to harm by target N [NN condition]; and 5) a control which did not state any actual or perceived harmful intention [C condition]. For students and parents, the perpetrator's harmful intention and the target's perception of harmful intention were important when considering whether a peer interaction constituted bullying. These findings confirm the applicability of the three-part definition of bullying, and highlight the importance of assessing these two dimensions of harmful intention when determining whether a problematic peer interaction should be regarded as bullying.

Although several factors have been linked with parents’ CP use, genetic influences on CP have rarely been studied, and an integrative view examining the interplay between different predictors of CP is missing. We focused on the separate and joint effects of religiosity, child aggression, parent's gender, and a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitution in the brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. Data came from a twin sample (51% male, aged 6.5 years). We used mothers’ and fathers’ self‐reports of CP and religiosity, and the other parent's report on child aggression. Complete data were available for 244 mothers and their 466 children, and for 217 fathers and their 409 children. The random split method was employed to examine replicability. For mothers, only the effect of religiosity appeared to replicate. For fathers, several effects predicting CP use replicated in both samples: child aggression, child sex, religiosity, and a three‐way (GxExE) interaction implicating fathers’ BDNF genotype, child aggression and religiosity. Religious fathers who carried the Met allele and had an aggressive child used CP more frequently; in contrast, secular fathers’ CP use was not affected by their BDNF genotype or child aggression. Results were also repeated longitudinally in a subsample with age 8–9 data. Findings highlight the utility of a bio‐ecological approach for studying CP use by shedding light on pertinent gene‐environment interaction processes. Possible implications for intervention and public policy are discussed.",

Reciprocal models of parent‐child behavior suggest that improving child behavior could lead to improvements in parent behavior, however no study has examined whether omega‐3 supplementation in children could reduce intimate partner violence or child maltreatment by their adult caregivers. In this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, stratified, parallel group trial, a community sample of children were randomized to receive either a fruit drink containing 1 gm of omega‐3 fats (Smartfish Recharge; Omega‐3 group, n = 100) or the same fruit drink without omega‐3's (Placebo group, n = 100). Child participants, adult caregivers, and research staff were blinded to group assignment. Adult caregivers reported inter‐partner and child‐directed physical assault and psychological aggression at baseline, 6 months (end of treatment) and 12 months (6 months post‐treatment) using the Conflicts Tactics Scale. Caregivers of children in the omega‐3 group reported long‐term reductions in psychological aggression in a group × time interaction. Improvements in adult psychological aggression were correlated with improvements in child externalizing behavior scores. No differences were reported for child maltreatment. This study is the first to show that omega‐3 supplementation in children can reduce inter‐partner psychological aggression among adult caregivers not receiving supplements.

    "abstract": "Research has found that moral competence is negatively associated with bullying behavior in schools, but the drivers of this association are not yet well understood. In this paper, we report on two studies which suggest that moral competence acts as a moderator of peer influence in the context of school bullying. Data were collected at two time points in three German higher secondary schools (grades 7-10, average age at measurement: 14.26 years). Using a cross-lagged panel design (CLPD), study 1 (N = 251) found adolescents with low moral competence to be susceptible to peer influence, while no such effect was found for adolescents with high moral competence. Study 2, a cross-sectional analysis (N = 748), found moral competence to be inversely related to the likelihood of an individual's conforming with the pro-bullying behavior of his or her peers. Neither study found corresponding effects for pro-social, defending behavior. Our findings further illuminate the associations between moral competence, peer influence, and school bullying. Some implications for bullying prevention are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Implicit measures of aggressiveness are able to circumvent response biases that plague self‐reports, but it is unclear how they link to neural activation during aggressive interactions and to aggression‐related endocrine function. Here, we tested whether an implicit attentional bias toward antisocial semantic information was associated with endogenous testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) levels, as well as with aggressive behavior and amygdala reactivity to angry faces in a separate competitive paradigm. On Day one, participants (39 healthy young women) completed an emotional word Stroop task in which they had to indicate the font color of antisocial, prosocial, or neutral words. On Day two, we measured subjects’ brain activity during a competitive reaction time task in which the female opponent displayed angry or neutral facial expressions at the start of each trial and provoked participants with increasingly strong sound blasts. T and C were measured in saliva during a regular weekday as well as before and after scanning. We previously showed that aggression was associated with enhanced amygdala reactivity to angry faces in this sample. The present analyses revealed that subjects were slower to identify the font color of antisocial relative to neutral words, and that this attentional bias predicted higher aggression. T and C were uncorrelated with Stroop scores. Crucially, the relationship between implicit attention to antisocial words and aggression was mediated by amygdala reactivity to angry faces. Our data indicate that a tendency to dwell on implicit hostile cues reflects enhanced responsivity to overt anger displays.",

The current study investigated physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) history, coercive condom use resistance (CUR), and heavy episodic drinking (HED) as prospective risk factors for rape perpetration. Young adult men ( N = 430) ages 21–30 completed background measures as well as follow‐up assessments regarding rape events perpetrated over the course of 3 months. Negative binomial regression with log link function was utilized to examine whether these risk factors interacted to prospectively predict completed rape. There was a significant interaction between physical IPV and HED predicting completed rape; men with high HED and greater physical IPV histories perpetrated more completed rapes during follow‐up than men with low HED at the same level of physical IPV. Moreover, psychological IPV and coercive CUR interacted to predict completed rape such that men with high coercive CUR and greater psychological IPV histories perpetrated more completed rapes throughout the follow‐up period than men with low coercive CUR at the same level of psychological IPV. Findings suggest targets for intervention efforts and highlight the need to understand the topography of different forms of aggression perpetration.",

    "abstract": "Amongst a number of negative life sequelae associated with childhood adversity is the later expression of a higher dispositional tendency to experience anger and frustration to a wide range of situations (i.e., trait anger). We recently reported that an association between childhood adversity and trait anger is moderated by individual differences in both threat-related amygdala activity and executive control-related dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity, wherein individuals with relatively low amygdala and high dlPFC activity do not express higher trait anger even when having experienced childhood adversity. Here, we examine possible structural correlates of this functional dynamic using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from 647 young adult men and women volunteers. Specifically, we tested whether the degree of white matter microstructural integrity as indexed by fractional anisotropy modulated the association between childhood adversity and trait anger. Our analyses revealed that higher microstructural integrity of multiple pathways was associated with an attenuated link between childhood adversity and adult trait anger. Amongst these pathways was the uncinate fasciculus (UF; ΔR 2 = 0.01), which not only provides a major anatomical link between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex but also is associated with individual differences in regulating negative emotion through top-down cognitive reappraisal. These findings suggest that higher microstructural integrity of distributed white matter pathways including but not limited to the UF may represent an anatomical foundation serving to buffer against the expression of childhood adversity as later trait anger, which is itself associated with multiple negative health outcomes.",

Neuropathic pain was induced by tibial nerve transection (TNT). Also, somatic and visceral pain was conducted by intraplantar injection of diluted formalin (1%, 20 μl) and intraperitoneal administration of acetic acid (0.6%, 200 μl), respectively. Fourteen and twenty one days after the TNT surgery, and also, 1 and 7 days following formalin and acetic acid administration, the three‐chambered test was used to determine sociability and preference for social novelty and resident/intruder test was used for the evaluation of the aggressive behaviors. In the sociability phase of the three‐chambered test, all the three models of pain did not change the animal's sociability. However, in the social novelty preference phase, the animals in pain showed deficits in social novelty preference by a significant increase in the time spent with the familiar mice compared to the control groups. Also, animals in pain significantly showed more aggressive behaviors like biting and clinching and have much less attack latency in comparison to the control groups. Pain‐induced changes in the social novelty preference and aggressive behaviors continued in the neuropathic group until the end of the experiment. However, 7 days following the induction of both formalin and visceral pain, animals' social memory, and aggression almost returned to the standard value. These results suggest that long‐lasting pain could lead to social memory impairment and increase aggressive behaviors in mice.",

However, there was also evidence revealing the weak influences that some referent groups yield on youth. The current study argues that the strength of normative influences on cyberbullying depends on the properties of the referent groups. In the school context, we examined whether class entitativity—the extent to which a class is a unified and coherent group, rather than a mere aggregation of students—moderated the relationship between class norms and cyberbullying. A total of 474 adolescent students responded to measures of descriptive and injunctive class norms about cyberbullying, perceived class entitativity, and cyberbullying. The results indicated that pro‐cyberbullying descriptive and injunctive class norms were positively correlated with cyber aggression. Most importantly, higher levels of pro‐cyberbullying class norms predicted increases in cyber aggression when students perceived their classes as highly entitative. In contrast, this effect was not significant when students perceived their classes having low entitativity. These findings promote an understanding of how peer norms work and provide an alternative strategy for interventions into cyber aggression in schools.",

    "abstract": "Psychological aggression has been shown to have harmful effects on both partners, sometimes above and beyond the effects of physical aggression. However, very little is known about psychological aggression during the transition to parenthood. The transition to parenthood is a time where relationship satisfaction often declines and stress increases, which may put the couples at higher risk for psychological aggression. The purpose of this study was to examine if prenatal risk factors related to interpersonal style (specifically, emotional flooding and hostility) predict changes in psychological aggression from pregnancy to 2 years postpartum. Ninety eight couples took part in this study. The couples completed self-report questionnaires during pregnancy, 1 year postpartum, and 2 years postpartum. Both partners were asked about perpetrating and experiencing psychological aggression in their current relationship. Two level Hierarchical Linear Models (HLMs) were used to examine longitudinal associations between hostility, flooding, and psychological aggression. For women, hostility during pregnancy was a significant longitudinal predictor of psychological aggression. For men, flooding was a significant longitudinal predictor of psychological aggression. For both men and women, relationship satisfaction partially mediated the relationship between flooding/hostility and psychological aggression, indicating that women's hostile attitudes and men's tendency to be flooded tend to erode relationship quality, leading to increases in psychological aggression. This may represent a classic demand-withdraw dynamic in couples. The results indicate hostility for women and flooding for men are potential prenatal risk factors for future psychological aggression.

    "abstract": "Although a wealth of research has examined the effects of parental mood disorders on offspring maladjustment, studies have not identified whether elevated interparental violence (IPV) may be an exacerbating influence in this pathway. This study examined levels of physical IPV perpetration and victimization in mothers with unipolar depression or Bipolar Disorder (BD) and the processes by which maternal physical IPV moderated adolescents' physical aggression in families with maternal mood disorders. Mothers with lifetime mood disorders were predicted to have elevated IPV compared to well mothers, and maternal IPV was expected to moderate the association between lifetime mood disorders and adolescent aggression. Participants included 61 intact families with maternal depression (n = 24), BD (n = 13), or well mothers (n = 24) and two siblings (ages 10 to 18 years). Using the Conflict Tactics Scale, mothers reported on IPV perpetration and victimization, and adolescents reported on physical aggression. Mothers with BD reported significantly higher IPV perpetration, but not victimization, than depressed or well mothers. An interaction between maternal BD and IPV perpetration was a significant predictor of adolescent aggression. Main effects of maternal IPV victimization and interaction effects of maternal depression and either type of IPV on adolescent aggression were not significant. Adolescents of mothers who have BD and perpetrate IPV may be particularly vulnerable to being aggressive. Prevention and policy efforts to deter transmission of aggression in high-risk families should target families with maternal BD and intervene at the level of conflict resolution within the family.

This study extended this area of research by examining prospective associations of positively biased self-perceptions of peer acceptance with overt and relational aggression. In addition, moderating effects of peer rejection were examined to test the \"disputed overestimation hypothesis,\" which posits that the link between bias and aggression is limited to children who are rejected by their peers. Using a two-wave longitudinal design, measures of peer-rated and self-perceived peer acceptance and peer-rated overt and relational aggression were obtained for 712 children in 3rd through 5th grades (386 girls and 326 boys). Positively biased perceptions led to increases in relational, but not overt, aggression. This pattern was observed even when the effects of gender, race, peer rejection, and overt aggression on relational aggression were controlled. Contrary to the disputed overestimation hypothesis, the prospective associations between bias and aggression did not vary as a function of children's peer rejection status, thus supporting the view that positive bias predicts future aggressive behavior, regardless of social status. The results are discussed in terms of the comparability with previous findings and practical implications.",

By simultaneously considering fighting, M‐rated video game play, parental restrictions on media use, parenting style, and important covariates, we aim to provide further nuance to existing work on risk and protective factors for interpersonal aggression. Our results show that parental restriction has a significant, linear relationship with later fighting, whereby higher restrictions on a child's M‐rated video game play predict decreases in reported fighting behavior. Authoritative parenting, high in both warmth and supervisory attention, also relates to decreased levels of fighting compared to other styles. Parenting style also moderated the effects of restriction, such that restriction was not equally predictive of fighting behavior across all parenting styles. However, the association between restriction and fighting was similar for highly demanding parenting styles, suggesting that authoritative parenting is not inherently superior to authoritarian. The effects of restriction were significant despite controlling for multiple covariates. Parental restriction of media use may be an effective strategy for parents concerned about violent games. Given some limitations in our dataset, we call for continued study in this area.",

The results showed that from the fall semester to the spring semester in Grade 7, adolescents’ victimization predicted subsequent low self‐esteem, while from the spring semester in Grade 7 to the fall semester in Grade 8 and from the fall semester in Grade 8 to the spring semester in Grade 8, adolescents’ low self‐esteem predicted subsequent victimization. Furthermore, teacher support moderated the relationship between victimization and self‐esteem, such that the above negative associations existed only when adolescents’ perceived teacher support was low. However, this protective effect was not found with peer support. The findings highlight the transactional dynamics between school victimization and self‐esteem and the protective role of teacher support, which has implications for effectively preventing and intervening school bullying.",

Frequently, animals fight to establish a dominance hierarchy and obtain a disputed resource. The Mexican mojarra Cichlasoma istlanum is a native species of the Balsas river basin and coexists there with four nonnative cichlids: tilapia Oreochromis sp., convict cichlid Amatitlania nigrofasciata , spotcheek cichlid Thorichthys maculipinnis , and green terror Andinoacara rivulatus . These five cichlid species compete for spaces for reproduction, feeding, and shelter and frequently engage in aggressive interactions to obtain these resources. We quantified dominance indices to evaluate the hierarchical structure of dominance among these five cichlids and the duration of aggressive behaviors of the Mexican mojarra during experimental contests between the native species and each of the four nonnative species. The Mexican mojarra was consistently dominant over the other four cichlid species, performing a larger number of aggressive behaviors and investing more time in attacking than the nonnative cichlids, which resulted in a higher hierarchical position. Our results show that the native fish, Mexican mojarra, established dominance over all four nonnative cichlid fish of the Balsas basin. Thus, the establishment of nonnative cichlid species in the Balsas basin is likely associated with factors other than behavioral dominance.",

As expected, competitive functions were associated with aggression and victimization in which the perpetrator had equal or less power than the victim, in line with the view that these are aversive and appetitive motives related to competition with rivals. Impression management and sadistic functions were associated with bullying and coercive resource control strategies (the latter for boys only), consistent with expectations that these are appetitive motives, with the former being more goal‐directed and the latter somewhat more impulsive. Finally, as hypothesized, reactive functions were associated with emotional symptoms, hostility, victimization by bullying, and aggression by perpetrators with equal or less power than the victim, consistent with theory and research conceptualizing reactive aggression as an impulsive, emotion‐driven response to provocation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Rates of childhood trauma are high amongst violent offenders who frequently recidivate. Few clinical options are available to treat excessive and recurring violent aggression associated with childhood trauma. Those that do exist are largely ineffective and often replete with side effects. One promising pharmacological target is the glutamate binding N ‐methyl‐ d ‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Clinically available NMDAR antagonists have proven successful in mitigating violent and aggressive behavior associated with a host of psychiatric diseases and have both immediate and long‐term effects on nervous system function and behavior. This study examined the impact of three NMDAR antagonists on long‐lasting aggression brought on by early‐life stress: MK‐801, memantine, and ketamine. We find that social isolation early in adolescence followed by acute traumatic stress in the form of noncontingent foot shock (FS) late in adolescence works in tandem to promote long‐lasting excessive aggression in mice when measured 1 week later. Systemic injections of MK‐801 and memantine 30 min before FS suppressed the long‐lasting attack behavior induced by our early life stress induction protocol. Systemic injections of ketamine, on the other hand, significantly enhanced the long‐lasting attack behavior when injected before FS. These findings indicate that MK‐801, memantine, and ketamine have distinct and opposing effects on early life stress‐induced aggression, suggesting these drugs may be mechanistically distinct. This study identifies memantine as a promising pharmacological treatment for aggressive behavior associated with early life stress and demonstrates the need for greater care when using glutamate receptor antagonists to treat aggression.",

    "abstract": "The effect of violent video games on aggressive behavior is an important topic in the field of game research. Recently, growing evidence suggests that justified game violence decreases feelings of guilt caused by in-game immoral behavior. However, little is known about the impact on aggressive behavior, and whether other factors moderate this effect. In a two-factor experiment, we tested the impact of justification of video game violence on aggressive behavior, and whether this effect would be enhanced by game immersion. Pilot experiment 1 (N = 60) and pilot experiment 2 (N = 40) demonstrated that the justification of violence and game immersion was successfully controlled by avatar and graphics quality. In the Main experiment, 123 participants played one of four conditions of a video game (2 [justification: justified vs. unjustified violence] × 2 [immersion: high vs. low immersion]) and it was found that participants who played in the justified violence condition reported greater aggressive behavior than those in the unjustified violence condition. In addition, participants who played in high immersion reported greater aggressive behavior than those in low immersion. However, game immersion did not moderate the effects of justified violence. This unexpected effect is likely due to participants' distancing themselves from and identifying less with their violent avatars.",

A total of 248 college students participated in the daily diary study in which they responded to the assessment on a daily basis for 7 consecutive days. The results indicated that daily stressors predicted daily verbal aggression; daily stressors, daily hurt feelings, and rejection sensitivity predicted somatic symptoms. Negative emotion regulation moderated the association between stressors and verbal aggression such that more stressors and high negative emotion regulation predicted more frequent daily verbal aggression. Rejection sensitivity moderated the association of hurt feelings to verbal and physical aggression. Perception of hurt feelings and high rejection sensitivity predicted more verbal aggression but less physical aggression. Rejection sensitivity also moderated the association of stressors to somatic symptoms such that more stressors and high rejection sensitivity predicted more somatic symptoms. The findings collectively highlight the importance of supporting individuals with high rejection sensitivity to encode social cues in a healthy way. It is imperative to provide emotion regulation skills to cope with negative emotions derived from social interactions.",

However, little is known about the developmental stability and changes in these roles. In the present study, we aimed to assess the stability and changes in bullying roles and examine risk and protective factors associated with bullying involvement. A total of 1711 Chinese early adolescents (47.4% girls, M age = 11.99) participated in the study at two time points approximately 6 months apart. Three subgroups of bullying were identified: bully‐victims, victims, and the uninvolved. In terms of stability and changes, the uninvolved were the most stable over time, while victims and bully‐victims tended to become the uninvolved. Bully‐victims also tended to become victims. Early adolescents with higher levels of parental psychological control and depression symptoms were more likely to be victims or bully‐victims. Higher levels of depression symptoms increased the risk of transitioning from being the uninvolved or bully‐victims to becoming victims. Higher levels of friendship quality were associated with higher odds of being the uninvolved or transitioning from being victims or bully‐victims to becoming the uninvolved. Our findings indicate that bullying roles were relatively stable, with some changes over time. The results also highlight the important function that parental psychological control, friendship quality, and depression symptoms can play in preventing and intervening in bullying.",

Only about 1% of individuals report perpetrating rape, in contrast to the 6% perpetrating rape as estimated by using behaviorally specific items that exclude stigmatized words such as rape. The goal of this study was to examine two possible measurement mechanisms for increasing perpetration acknowledgment: label choice and response format. In Sample 1 (N = 291), participants completed two acknowledgment items which varied in label choice. One item used the term rape; one used the term sexual assault. Acknowledgment of perpetration using the label sexual assault was significantly higher than when using the term rape (6.38%-1.71%, p = .01, Cohen's d = 0.44). In Sample 2 (N = 438), participants were presented with a scaled and a dichotomous sexual assault item at different parts of the overall survey. Sexual assault acknowledgment was higher on the scaled item compared to the dichotomous item (15.75% vs. 3.2%, p < .0001, Cohen's d = 0.64). Rates of sexual perpetration as measured behaviorally were higher for ambiguous acknowledgment types (\"might or might not,\" \"probably not\") than for those reporting \"definitely not,\" (76.81% vs. 29.0%, p < .0001, Cohen's d = 0.59). The two different measurement strategies tested here, using a less stigmatized label such as sexual assault and using a scaled response format, both increased rates of perpetration acknowledgment 3-15x greater than rates documented in prior research.",

The proportion of violence cases involving firearms also increased during this time, yet little research has examined these effects using data from the second wave of COVID infections. Explanations for these documented increases in gun violence put forward by scholars include increased firearm purchases, alcohol consumption, unemployment, and organized crime activity. The current work examined these trends in Richmond, VA. We collected data on patients ( N = 1744) presenting with violent injuries from 2018 to 2022 from the emergency department of a Level‐1 Trauma Center in Richmond, VA. Data were coded on the basis of whether they presented before the pandemic, during the first wave, or during the second wave. Logistic binomial regressions revealed that the risk of gunshot wounds increased by 32% during the first wave and 44% during the second wave, relative to the pre‐COVID period, but that the increase between the first and second wave was not significant. These findings held after controlling for victim age, race, sex, and injury severity. Further analyses revealed that these effects were specific to violent injury, as we found no increase in firearm use among self‐injury cases. The heightened violence reported during the COVID‐19 pandemic was also observed in Richmond, VA. Gun violence in particular increased over time as other forms of violence (i.e., assaults, stabbings, and self‐harm) decreased.",

This suggested a substantive psychophysiological reaction of participants to hateful comments. However, such HR deceleration was not observed among participants preexposed to HS. People exposed to hateful comments thus appeared to show different HR responses to HS compared to people who were not previously exposed to such comments. Consequently, not only does frequent exposure to HS influence an individual's beliefs as observed in earlier studies, but it also impacts psychophysiological reactions to derogatory language.",

A community sample of 2174 Spanish participants (51.1% male; age range: 18–79 years) completed the 28‐item Spanish version of the DDDI. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a three‐factor model fitted adequately to the data. Analysis of internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent validity showed that the Spanish adaptation of the DDDI had good psychometric properties and retains the theoretical consistency of the original scale. Gender and age differences were observed. The Spanish version of the DDDI can be considered a good instrument for assessing dangerous driving behavior, thus contributing to the cross‐cultural study of these types of behaviors and the possible development of intervention programs aimed at reducing road traffic accidents.",

Participants were 2575 middle school students ( M age = 12.20, SD = 1.02; 52% female; 83% African American) from the southeastern US attending schools in communities with high rates of violence. Participants completed four waves of assessments every 3 months (i.e., fall, winter, spring, and summer). Each belief subscale mediated relations between perceptions of parental support for fighting and nonviolence and changes in aggression. Parental support for nonviolence was negatively associated with beliefs supporting reactive aggression and positively associated with beliefs against fighting. Parental support for retaliation was positively associated with beliefs supporting reactive and proactive aggression, and negatively associated with beliefs against fighting. Parental support for fighting as sometimes necessary was positively associated with beliefs supporting reactive aggression and beliefs that fighting is sometimes necessary. Beliefs supporting reactive and proactive aggression and beliefs that fighting is sometimes necessary were positively associated with aggression, whereas beliefs against fighting were negatively associated with aggression. Parents' support for fighting and for nonviolence may directly and indirectly reduce adolescents' physical aggression by influencing beliefs about the appropriateness of using aggression for self‐defense and to attain a goal. This highlights the importance of jointly investigating multiple types of parental messages and types of beliefs about fighting.",

We hypothesized that an obsessive (vs. harmonious) passion for guns would be associated with a belief in a dangerous world (BDW). We expected this relationship to intensify in threatening contexts, leading to a more expansive view on defensive gun ownership. We tested this hypothesis across three threat contexts: a gun‐control message (Study 1, N = 342), a live shooting simulation (Study 2, N = 398), and the aftermath of the Christchurch mass shootings (Study 3, N = 314). In the experimental Study 1, exposure to a gun‐control message increased the intention to purchase guns among those with an obsessive passion (OP) for guns. Study 2 revealed that BDW mediated the relationship between OP and assertive modes of protection, the desire to purchase high‐stopping‐power guns, and anti‐Black racial bias in a shooting task. Study 3 showed that knowledge of the Christchurch attack intensified the link between OP and BDW, leading to increased support for gun access, a willingness to act as a citizen‐protector, and prejudice against Muslims. Comprehending these dynamics can assist policymakers in crafting messaging campaigns for firearm regulation and public safety measures that are more effective.",

Four experiments tested the impact of lyrics and/or musical tone on aggressive and prosocial behavior, and on underlying psychological processes, using purpose-built songs to avoid the effect of music-related confounds. In study one, where mildly aggressive, overtly aggressive and violent lyrics were compared to neutral lyrics, any level of lyrical aggression caused an increase in behavioral aggression, which plateaued for all three aggression conditions. Violent lyrics were better recalled than other lyrics one week later. In studies two-three no significant effects of lyrics, or of aggressive versus nonaggressive musical tone, were found on aggressive or prosocial behavior. In terms of internal states, violent lyrics increased hostility/hostile cognitions in all studies, and negatively impacted affective state in three studies. Prosocial lyrics decreased hostility/hostile cognitions in three studies, but always in tandem with another factor. Aggressive musical tone increased physiological arousal in two studies and increased negative affect in one. In study four those who listened to violent lyrics drove more aggressively on a simulated drive that included triggers for aggression. Overall, violent lyrics consistently elicited hostility/hostile cognitions and negative affect, but these did not always translate to aggressive behavior. Violent music seems more likely to elicit behavioral aggression when there are aggression triggers and a clear way to aggress. Implications are discussed.",

A sample of 788 high school students completed several validated measures of these constructs. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that each step significantly and positively predicted the next step, and the addition of a direct path from accepting responsibility to helping improved model fit. The mediational model indicated that individual‐level characteristics had significant direct effects on interpreting bullying and sexual harassment as problems, accepting responsibility, and helping, and indirect effects from noticing the bullying and sexual harassment to all subsequent steps except knowing.

One particularly concerning outcome is the widespread presence of suicidal ideation in this group, which poses a significant threat to their life. However, the specific impact of cyber aggression on suicidal ideation and the longitudinal mechanisms remains unclear. Hence, this study sought to address these gaps by applying the general aggression model (GAM). The investigation utilized three‐wave longitudinal data with 6‐month intervals from a large sample of Chinese emerging adults ( N = 1568; 54.7% female; M age = 19.70 [SD = 1.44], ranging from 17 to 26 years). The random‐intercept cross‐lagged panel model (RI‐CLPM) was employed to explore the roles of depressive symptoms and nonsuicidal self‐injury (NSSI) between cyber aggression and suicidal ideation at both the between‐ and within‐person levels. The findings indicated that, at the between‐person level, there were trait‐like associations between depressive symptoms and cyber aggression, NSSI, and suicidal ideation. At the within‐person level, cyber aggression exhibited unidirectional positive cross‐lagged effects on depressive symptoms and NSSI, and could subsequently indirectly lead to suicidal ideation via the contemporaneous associations from depressive symptoms and NSSI to suicidal ideation. These results not only align with GAM but also shed light on the underlying mechanisms linking cyber aggression to suicidal ideation. Also, the findings underscore the significance of maintaining a positive network environment for the well‐being of all internet users even cyber aggression perpetrators.",

The data were used to test two prominent hypotheses about the evolutionary function of this general category of play behaviour that have been applied to children, especially boys, of this age. One is that rough-and-tumble play provides practice for the development of real fighting skills and the other that it serves as a safe way to establish/display social dominance. Both hypotheses predict that boys will engage in more rough-and-tumble play than girls, especially those types that are used in fighting/dominance contests. Boys were found to engage in significantly more chase initiation activities, more bouts of brief rough-and-tumble play, more bouts of restraining and more bouts of boxing/hitting than girls. These data provide some support for the two hypotheses, although significant sex differences were not found for all types of rough-and-tumble play observed. No significant age differences were obtained, suggesting that the two hypotheses may be applicable throughout the 8- to 11-year-old period and not just at the end of it as previous research had suggested. Study 2 presented observational data concerning the motor patterns used in aggressive fighting. In all but one case, there were no significant differences in the extent to which 8/9- and 10/11-year-old girls and boys employed wrestling, hitting and restraining, supporting the view that the practice fighting hypothesis is relevant throughout the 8-11-year-old period. It was argued that age and sex differences provide a useful means of scrutinising functional hypotheses, and that splitting behavioural categories that contain disparate action patterns facilitates more refined tests of those hypotheses. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Aggression in the convict cichlid Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum was measured under two different environmental parameters after introduction of a conspecific intruder. Measurements were made after 24-hr and 48-hr teritorial residence times at both 26°C and 30°C. Eight fish established territories in individual tanks each containing one terra cotta pot. Intruders contained in a glass cylinder were introduced into the territories. An opaque divider separating the resident from the intruder was removed after a 15-min acclimation period. At 26°C, we observed a significant difference in the mean number of bites of the cichlids of 24-hr and 48-hr residency durations, whereas, at 30°C, such a difference did not exist. Statistical analysis showed that cichlids exhibited more aggression at 30°C than at 26°C. Increased aggression levels at the higher temperature may be related to the fact that cichlids establish territories and spawn at about 30°C.",

The findings show that in some cases SII is an unsucessful suicide while in others SII is anything but a reflection of a death wish. It appears that the modus operandi is a major indication as to the intentions of the actor. The study also demonstrates the difference between the population of the suiciders and that of the SII victims. While suiciders seem to score higher on the Performance Prediction Score (PPS) and Combat Suitability Scale, the SII population seems to be overly represented in the lower parts of the PPS and the Combat Suitability Scale. The study used a data set that represents a 5 year period, and followed the consequences of the SII in terms of medical status and occupational assignment of the actors. The findings yielded some possible policy implications, in terms of a better classification of the relevant populations, and a possible attribution of a more refined meaning to the behavior. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Violence against women is a global phenomenon linked to patriarchal cultural values and social structures that subordinate women. In Latin America, grass roots women's organizations and the Inter-American Commission of Women have recently turned their attention to pressing the governments of the Americas to address the endemic problem of violence against women. The work of the Inter-American Commission of Women has been particularly important but widely ignored in this area. As a specialized commission of the Organization of American States, the Inter-American Commission of Women has long worked to improve the rights and status of women throughout the Americas and has recently succeeded in negotiating an important international convention, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence Against Women. This convention breaks new ground by defining violence against women as a violation of women's human rights and by identifying the duties of states to address the problem. This article traces the historical and contemporary role of the Inter-American Commission of Women in negotiating international norms aimed at defining and securing women's rights in the Americas. It outlines the specific work the commission carried out in negotiating the Convention on Violence Against Women, which has been in force since 1995, and it examines the innovative international norms found in the convention. It shows that, despite problems of public obscurity and state resistances to change, the commission has pressed governments from the international level to address and improve women's rights. Combined with a growing women's movement at the grass roots level in the Americas, the governments of the region are now having to take real steps to combat violence against women. Aggr.

Dominance relationships with no systematic effect of gender characterize the former, whereas the latter is based on female dominance. The present study was done on two captive groups of brown lemurs and one semi–free‐ranging group of black lemurs. To reveal links between the specific pattern of social organization and agonistic behaviors, agonistic interactions were analyzed for each species as for their context of occurrence, symmetry, initiation, and outcome. The effect of gender in the initiation of conflicts appeared as the only notable interspecific difference, aggression being mostly initiated by females in E. macaco and by males in E. fulvus . Conflict outcome was generally in favor of the initiator, regardless of gender in both species. The analysis of postconflict behaviors revealed conciliatory processes in the brown lemur, whereas reconciliation seemed to be absent in the black lemur, a characteristic shared with the ring‐tailed lemur ( Lemur catta ), another lemur species with female dominance.

    "abstract": "Sixty hooded Long-Evans rats were assigned to one of three conditions: isolation-rearing (from 14–30 days of age), brief isolation (from 28–30 days of age), and normal (no isolation). From day 14 to day 21, the isolation-reared animals were maintained in an incubator set at 35°C to prevent hypothermia and were separated from each other by Plexiglas. They learned to nourish themselves by lapping milk that continuously flowed down one side of the enclosure. Thereafter, they were housed in standard hanging wire cages. Unlike previous studies of isolation at this age, there were no significant weight differences between the isolation-reared group and the two control groups. At 30 days of age, the three groups were compared on fighting (serious and play), nonagonistic social behaviors (following and crawling under), and exploratory behavior (open-field ambulation). The isolation-reared group was significantly different from the normal group on all measures (isolates were higher on all measures except exploration). The isolation-reared animals showed significantly more serious fighting (aggression) than the brief isolation animals, whereas these two groups did not differ on other behaviors. This methodology allows for the study of isolation-rearing without the nutritional confounds found in previous research and shows an effect on aggression that is not accounted for by recent isolation.

    "abstract": "In the highly social rat, male juvenile and adult subordinates initiate more playful contacts with dominant pairmates than vice versa. This study examined the effect of dominance on playful contacts in the relatively asocial golden hamster. Pairs of male hamsters were reared together from weaning, and their play was filmed in the juvenile (28-36 days) and the young adult (60-70 days) stages of development. By the adult stage, it became clear that one pairmate was dominant over the other. The dominant pairmate launched all aggressive attacks (i. e., bites to the lower flanks and rump), and the subordinate pairmate performed all the submissive gesturing (e. g., tail up submissive posture). Playful contact, which in this species involves gentle nibbling of the posterior cheeks, was more frequently launched by the dominant than by the subordinate. This was not only true at the adult stage, but also at the juvenile stage, before dominance-subordination relationships were sharply polarized. Therefore, it would appear that in the relatively asocial hamster, the subordinates tend to avoid playful contact with dominants. This is markedly different to rats, where the subordinates actively seek out and engage dominants in play. This contrast further supports our hypothesis that subordinate male rats use play as a means of maintaining familiarity with dominants. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

A total of 210 male and 196 female prisoners were categorised into four groups: pure bullies, pure victims, bully/victims, and those not involved in bullying or victimisation. Prisoners completed a questionnaire that presented them with different bullying scenarios and were asked to suggest ways of dealing with each. Female bully/victims produced significantly more solutions in response to theft‐related bullying than male bully/victims. There were no further significant group or gender differences in the number of solutions generated. The bully group favoured aggressive responses for all scenarios. Males reported more aggressive responses than females. The results are discussed with reference to the environment in which the social problem solving is taking place and highlights the importance of distinguishing between the different groups involved in bullying.

    "abstract": "The aims of this paper are to study the aggressive behavior in male mice with consecutive experience of victories in 2, 10, and 20 days (T2, T10, and T20 winners) of daily agonistic confrontations under the sensory contact model and to determine the most probable behavioral domains that should be used as animal models for learned aggression in humans. It has been shown that the structure of winners' behavior changes from test to test: the attacking behavior prevailed (81% of the total time) in the behavior of T2 winners. Attacks and diggings (herein: digging up and scattering the litter on the partner' territory) prevailed in the behavior of T10 winners (each approximately 40%). T20 winners demonstrated aggressive grooming half of the testing time and digging behavior 25% of the time. Correlational analysis revealed that the number of significant correlations between the behavioral domains (attacking, digging, aggressive grooming, self-grooming, threats, rotations) and between different behavioral parameters (latency, number, total and average time) of one behavioral domain are growing from the second test to twentieth test, and the relationships between the behavioral domains change qualitatively. The following may be regarded as elements of learned aggression in male mice: (1) appearance of aggressive grooming instead of the intensive attacking behavior and (2) involvement of the digging behavior in the hostile behavior together with the threats and attacking behavior. Negative correlations between parameters of the behavioral domains may testify to the replacement of one behavioral pattern by another and reflect learned behavior. Positive correlations between certain behavioral domains may reflect the formation of a common motivational background for the winners' behavior. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Play-fighting by juvenile montane and prairie voles involves attack and defense of the head, neck and shoulders. Since during play animals typically borrow behavior patterns from other functional contexts, two adult behavioral contexts were compared to juvenile play-fighting. These were serious fighting and sexual encounters. During serious fighting in a resident-intruder paradigm, most bites are directed at the rump and lower flanks. During sexual encounters, especially in precopulatory behavior, the head, neck and shoulders are gently contacted. Therefore, play-fighting by juveniles would appear to involve attack and defense of areas of the body contacted in adult precopulatory behavior, not adult fighting. Furthermore, the species-specific differences in juvenile play-fighting were also found to be matched by species-specific differences in precopulatory behavior. In both playful and precopulatory encounters, montane voles contacted the head and used upright defensive behaviors more often than prairie voles. In contrast, prairie voles made mutual contact more often and were more likely to rotate to supine in defense of contact to the nape and head. These findings support our hypothesis that juvenile play-fighting in muroid rodents involves the precocial expression of precopulatory, not agonistic behavior.",

A number of studies of nonhuman primates have indicated that spatial density influences agonistic activity levels less than does social density. Artificial fissioning of a captive troop of rhesus macaques was undertaken and the resultant differences in patterns of aggression and affiliation were examined. If population density has a major effect on levels of aggression, then fissioning will result in a decrease in aggression; if social stability has a major effect on levels of aggression, then fissioning is likely to be accompanied by an increase in aggression. An increase in rates of both aggressive and affiliative behavior resulted from artificial troop fissioning. These findings concur with other studies that have concluded that social stability is a more important determinant of primate aggression than is population density. Nonhuman primates use affiliative mechanisms to adjust their behavior when population density increases such that potentially adverse consequences of crowding are avoided.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Child abuse has been frequently associated with adult aggression in its many forms. The Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP) is a popular laboratory‐based procedure derived from the retaliatory responses of participants engaged in a monetary‐reinforced computer game. PSAP responses have been found to discriminate between participants with and without violent, antisocial, substance abuse, and even contact‐sport athletic histories. The present study provided an initial test of the sensitivity of the PSAP and the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) in discriminating between college students ( n =28) with and without reported histories of recurrent physical abuse as defined by incidents of being pushed, shoved, struck, punched, or threatened with physical violence by a parent more than once every six weeks over 15 years of upbringing. PSAP responses were substantially higher ( d =2.1) among participants reporting histories of recurrent parental physical abuse, with 46% (as opposed to 0% for controls) of these individuals generating PSAP responses in excess of 400 (average found for violent parolees). Group differences on the OAS were also considerable (&gt;1 SD). Larger factorial designs examining relationships between a range of developmental variables (e.g., domestic abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, parental divorce, family climate, etc.) and adult PSAP responding may help advance present knowledge regarding the impact of childhood adversity on psychological development.

    "abstract": "Female aggression may be the regulator of population size in small mammals. Freely growing populations of house mice showed several differences in aggressive female behavior in the presence and the absence of a male hierarchy. Territoriality in females and not in males appeared to maintain social order and regulate population density. Certain females were seen patrolling and guarding the territory and chasing and fighting with both male and female intruders. These females did not fight amongst themselves, suggesting that they were not fighting for rank (as do the males) but for territory. Although these aggressive females produced young, the pups were neglected, and few were weaned. The non-aggressive females were the successful breeders. Aggression by the females only occurred when there was reproduction and increased densities. Assembled females with no males present never show this aggression. The occurrence of \"male-type\" behavior became most apparent when the males were removed at peak population densities. The removed males were then castrated and injected with testosterone cyprionate. Doses were increased by population cage, and therefore all males returned to each freely growing population were given the same dose. The males given oil placebo injections showed no return of a male hierarchy and the females showed high levels of aggression toward them. Males injected with testosterone cyprionate showed return of male aggression and fighting and mounting of females. But the new \"dominant\" females continued their patrols and chased males away from their territories and did not permit these males to mount. Male-male fighting consisted primarily of frontal attacks to the face and roll and tumble fights. Female-male aggression consisted primarily of attacks to the posterior region targeted at the base of the tail and the genitals of the male. The males were rarely seen attacking females and then only during mating. Females only attacked each other in defense of their territories.",

The drug was found to strongly inhibit entry into a novel open field, exploration of a complex maze, or approach to a novel object placed in the animal's home cage. Time sampling techniques were used to assess drug effects on frequencies of immobility, activity, and grooming and rearing responses prior to and for 70 min after footshock. There were no group differences during the 10 min immediately following shock but the groups diverged steadily in immobility, activity, and grooming for the remainder of the observations. Post-shock activity and grooming responses increased steadily towards baseline values among control mice but remained at low levels or declined among drug-treated mice. Immobility responses declined steadily among control mice but increased substantially among the fluprazine-treated mice throughout post-shock observations. Pairs of male mice treated with fluprazine were also found to maintain greater intermouse distances in a novel linear runway than pairs of undrugged adult males, juvenile males, or male-female pairs. It is suggested that fluprazine hydrochloride both potentiates fear and alters its time course in addition to interfering in some way with normal olfactory processes.",

Aggression between wood ant nests is highest in early spring, and many wood ant wars break out then. The end of these wars coincides with a strong increase in prey density. Since the casualties are taken as food to the warring nests, a hypothesis is formulated that warfare between wood ant nests only occurs in periods when prey demand exceeds the supply. Protein-rich food in early spring is mainly for the benefit of the queens and the sexual larvae. Although the most obvious function of warfare is the defence of a foraging area, the main function may be the advancement of the mating flight dates of the queens in order to make the chance of propagating their genes greatest.",

    "abstract": "The object of the present study was to assess the rat's socioagonistic behavior by means of ethological procedures. Two groups of male Wistar rats were used: 33 residents and 66 intruders. To allow reliable characterization of social and agonistic patterns, social interactions were increased by the isolation of residents and, on the other hand, both offense in residents and defense in intruders were increased by differences in weight, agonistic experience, and habituation to the enclosure. Encounters were videotaped, and the animals' behavior was analyzed by a 27-pattern ethogram and a software package made up to this end. Several patterns parameters were quantified, and two ethological mathematical models were employed: sequential analysis of preferential directions and cluster analysis based on similarities between patterns. Following mean latencies of the most frequent elements, the first four pattern sequences appeared to be the same in both groups of animals. From the fifth pattern on, residents displayed mainly dominance and threat, whereas intruders showed defensive and submissive patterns. Attack was also displayed by residents, but less frequently than dominance and threat. The alpha status was established by two sorts of domination, either through dominance and threat or by attack. The mean frequency of the intraindividual transition of patterns was higher in residents than in intruders. Pathway graphs, derived from sequential analysis, showed some common dyads, triads, or quadrads of patterns, but they basically defined different behavior structures in residents and intruders. Dendrograms, obtained by cluster analysis, allowed classification of patterns into behavior categories. The categories in residents were exploration, dominance, threat, and attack, and they encompassed 18 elements; in intruders the categories were exploration, dominance, and defense, and they consisted of nine patterns. A submissive category composed of three patterns could be also deduced considering similarity results. To summarize, six behavior categories were obtained: one \"socioindividual\" (exploration) and five \"agonistic\" (dominance, threat, attack, submission, and defense). In conclusion, the present study shows how ethological procedures may help to elucidate the rat's socioagonistic behavior and to classify the observed patterns into behavior categories.",

The used psychometric instruments were the state of anxiety subscale (sA) of the Delusions Symptoms States Inventory (DSSI) and the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire (HDHQ). The two questionnaires were administered during the first week of admission and completed again before the discharge of the patient. Two groups of patients emerged and were examined according to the sA scores reported on the second measurement. Group I (n = 44) consisted of patients reporting lower anxiety scores on the second measurement and Group II (n = 22) consisted of patients reporting higher anxiety scores on the second measurement. In Group I, the drop of anxiety scores was accompanied by parallel and highly significant drops of all hostility scores. In Group II, the increased anxiety scores were accompanied by non-significant or marginally significant changes of hostility scores. The notion that hostility and anxiety are positively related was not fully supported. Also, the opposite thesis that there is a negative relationship between anxiety and hostility was not supported. The present study suggests that the levels of anxiety during the course of inpatient treatment are a factor influencing the temporal relationship between anxiety and hostility. Aggr.

It has been shown by using a genetical analysis performed on C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains, their reciprocal F1 hybrids, and back-crosses that these indices of intermale aggression are under different genetic control. Aggressive behavior intensity depends on the additive effects of genes. The control of strain aggressiveness level revealed that a high level of aggressiveness was dominant.

Both sources yield trends and some significant findings that are in line with the animal research based expectations of a positive androgen effect on the development of aggressive behavior. However, the available studies have many methodological weaknesses, and the results are not strong and open to interpretations by factors other than prenatal hormones. Potential modes of prenatal sex hormone effects are also discussed. In the second part, we present data on 13 boys and 15 girls who had been exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in utero and on 28 closely pair-matched controls. The double-blind follow-up examination at age 9 to 14 years included questionnaires, half-structured interviews with mother and child separately, and a battery of psychological tests. Interviews were tape-recorded and rated by two independent raters. The results show weak but consistent differences, with the MPA-exposed subjects being lower in self- or mother-reported aggression than the controls. The results cannot be accounted for by differences in aggression-related rearing styles. However, the influence of pregnancy pathology cannot be totally excluded. We conclude that the available data are compatible with the hypothesis that prenatal sex hormones influence the development of human aggressive behavior. More sophisticated research studies are needed, however, to demonstrate hormonal effects and their mechanism of action in a reliable and valid fashion.",

    "abstract": "Affiliative interactions between former opponents soon after a conflict, in non-human primates and pre-school children, have been documented to be followed by a reduction of future aggression and stress reactions, and to promote tolerance between individuals. The phenomenon has, therefore, been called reconciliation. Studies of non-human primates have shown that the conflict cause can influence the reconciliatory outcome, and whether the aggressor or the victim of the aggression is more likely to take the initiative to reconcile, can differ between species. Few studies in pre-school children have addressed how factors preceding the post-conflict period, such as social interactions before the conflict outbreak, or the cause of the conflict, may be related to the likelihood of reconciliation, conflict progression, and conflict outcome in the form of possible continuation or initiation of interactions. Twenty boys were video-recorded during free-play at six pre-schools. The existence of social interaction between the opponents in the upcoming conflict was examined in the pre-conflict period. The observed causes of conflict were determined and classified into five categories. The affiliative behaviors identified in the post-conflict period were classified into six categories. Finally, whether or not conflicts were followed by communicative exchanges in the succeeding non-conflict period was documented. The results revealed that the cause of the conflict is associated with whether opponents had established social interaction prior to conflict in the pre-conflict period. Acceptance rates (for the various categories of affiliative behaviors) appeared to differ. A non-random pattern of conflict progression was apparent, suggesting the conflict cause was related to the category of reconciliatory strategy shown by the individuals. The aggressor and the victim initiated reconciliation at similar rates, with the exception of verbal apologies, which were initiated most often by the aggressor. Finally, the data also showed that higher frequencies of social interaction between former opponents in the succeeding non-conflict period were associated both with whether or not social interaction had occurred in the pre-conflict period, and whether or not the conflict was reconciled. In conclusion, communicative factors preceding conflicts, and conflict cause, are distinctively correlated with both the use and the outcome of post-conflict affiliation in pre-school boys. Aggr.

Aggressive responding also produced intervals free from further attack by the fictitious participant. Provocation was manipulated by having the fictitious person subtract points from the participant. Each participant next completed the same task with an explicit FR 10 escape response option added. The escape option produced intervals free from attack identical to the aggressive option, but without taking points away from the fictitious participant. Results indicate that the availability of an escape response attenuated aggressive behavior in response to provocation. Aggr. Behav. 00:000–000, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Studies on this topic have not assessed multiple forms of media use and statistically controlled for individual characteristics likely to influence attitudes beyond sociodemographic information. In this study, undergraduate students ( N =319) aged 18–20 years (56% male) completed a survey assessing media use (number of hours per week spent playing videogames, watching movies/TV shows, watching TV sports) and attitudes toward interpersonal violence, punitive criminal justice policies, and different types of military activities (preparedness/defense and aggressive intervention). Greater number of hours spent watching TV contact sports was associated with more favorable attitudes toward military preparedness/defense, aggressive military intervention, and punitive criminal justice policies among men independently of parental education, lifetime violence exposure within the home and community, aggressive personality, and constrained problem solving style. Greater number of hours spent watching violent movies/TV was associated with more favorable attitudes toward military preparedness/defense among men and with more favorable attitudes toward interpersonal violence and punitive criminal justice policies among women, but these associations became non‐significant when adjusting for covariates.

    "abstract": "The present study is the first to explore patient-to-patient bullying within a secure psychiatric hospital housing mentally-ill patients. Its main aim was to provide an outline of the perceptions held by both patients and staff with regards to patient-to-patient bullying as opposed to providing an objective study of bullying. The total sample comprised 104 participants, 44 patients and 60 staff. These were sampled from wards housing male patients and wards housing female patients. All participants took part in a semi-structured interview based on that developed by Ireland and Ireland [2003] and Ireland [2005, 2004]. One quarter of participants stated they had seen a patient being bullied in the previous week, with staff perceiving a higher extent of bullying than patients. Differences between wards were minimal. It was predicted that theft-related bullying would be reported most frequently, that staff would identify a wider range of bullying behaviours than patients and that direct forms of aggression would be identified more readily as bullying than indirect forms. All predictions were supported. Problems in attempting to obtain a definition of bullying were also identified, with participants operating broader definitions than those found in the school-based literature. For example, bullying was not generally considered a repeated form of aggression, the severity of the aggression or provocative behaviour of the victim were not defining features, and it was felt bullying could be accidental. In summary, the current study highlights how patient-to-patient bullying does occur in services housing mentally-ill patients and that researching the behaviour may require the adoption of broader hospital-specific definitions of bullying.

    "abstract": "Abstract Study 1 used two scenarios depicting provocations to investigate whether prisoners' willingness to engage in physical aggression would vary according to the perceived fighting ability (Resource Holding Power [RHP]) of the opponent. RHP was operationalized in terms of three levels of the size, number of allies, and reputation. The sample (both sexes; N =1,253) was taken from a range of British prisons. Unexpectedly, the prisoners said that they would be less likely to attack a weaker opponent than an equally matched one. The predicted decline from equally matched to more formidable opponents was found only under some conditions. A further sample of male prisoners ( N =260), completed a similar provocation scenario, with response options covering fear, several forms of aggression, the importance of the provocation for reputation, and that the provocation was unimportant. Fear increased with RHP as predicted. Lower physical aggression to a low RHP opponent was again found, and it was associated with a lesser impact on reputation of an insult from this source. There was also a lower likelihood of responding with physical aggression to a high RHP opponent, as originally predicted. Implications of the findings for motivational theories of aggression are discussed, and also the applicability to humans of concepts from game theory models of the evolution of fighting strategies.

At ages 12 and 14, the twins' aggression was assessed by their classroom teachers, using a rating form of the Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory. Genetic and environmental sources of continuity and change were studied by fitting a longitudinal bivariate Cholesky decomposition model. Longitudinal model‐fitting results indicated that both genetic and environmental factors influenced continuity in aggression during this 2‐year period, but the age‐to‐age correlation of these factors differed by sex. Continuity in boys' aggression was mediated by genes and common environmental factors; in girls, in contrast, continuity was due primarily to common environmental, and to a lesser degree, unique environmental factors. Genes and unique environments contributed to change in aggression in both sexes. Aggr. Behav. 31:1–13, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The paucity of information on the phenomenon is particularly acute in the non-Western world where scholarly research is virtually nonexistent. The specific goal for this article, then, was to provide additional insights into the issue by investigating wife-to-husband killings that occurred in Ghana, a non-Western society, during 1990-2005. In line with the scant, extant literature, the results of the analysis demonstrate that victims were invariably slain at home. The motive for the crime was to punish a womanizing husband, a husband who had taken another wife, or one who was contemplating wedding another wife in this polygynous society. In other instances, the homicidal intent was to physically eliminate a husband to facilitate an amorous relationship between the assailant and her new lover. In several cases, husband-slayers killed a latent or predisposing victim (e.g. sleeping or ill) via burning, slashing with a machete or food poisoning. The implications of the findings are discussed.",

We hoped to gain a better understanding of friction and violence phenomena. The Acali experiment grew out of the more limited raft studies of Ra 1 and Ra 2. Intelligence and personality of the 11 members of the Acali raft expedition of 1973 were assessed by crew members and by shore-based scientists. Predictions concerning the Likely outcome of this long period of unavoidable proximity to 10 other individuals were made by a variety of scientists. Media treatment and views of friends and relatives were also studied. Some of the basic findings of the study were that assessments of both intelligence and personality carried out by these two methods were very different. Practising artists showed better predictive powers concerning the outcome of the voyage than either natural or social scientists. Media treatment influenced the views of the relatives of volunteers. It is suggested that laboratory assessments may not be related to assessed performances under stress, and that further progress in understanding human hostility will depend on a better knowledge of individual interactions.",

Derived from the revised version of the frustration–aggression hypothesis [Berkowitz, 1989], the present studies investigated the association between unemployment and aggression, as well as the moderating role of the self in this context. Because previous research on unemployment and aggression has been plagued by the cause‐and‐effect issue, the present research employed both an experimental and a correlational field approach. Three studies revealed that participants who expected to be unemployed after their degree (Studies 1 and 3), or who were currently unemployed (Study 2), reported stronger aggressive inclinations than participants who expected not to be unemployed or who were not unemployed at the time of data collection. However, this aggression‐eliciting effect of expected or real unemployment only occurred for participants with low self‐awareness. Participants who could actualize their self prior to reporting on aggression were not differently affected by different expectations or states of unemployment. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Male aggressiveness is a complex behavior influenced by a number of genetic and non-genetic factors. Traditionally, the contribution of each of these factors has been established from experiments using artificially selected strains for high/low aggressive phenotypes. However, little is known about the factors underlying aggressive behavior in natural populations. In this study, we assess the influence of genetic background vs. postnatal maternal environment using a set of cross-fostering experiments between two wild-derived inbred strains, displaying high (STRA, derived from Mus musculus domesticus) and low (BUSNA, derived from Mus musculus musculus) levels of aggressiveness. The role of maternal environment was tested in males with the same genetic background (i.e. strain origin) reared under three different conditions: unfostered (weaned by mother), infostered (weaned by an unfamiliar dam from the same strain), and cross-fostered (weaned by a dam from a different strain). All males were tested against non-aggressive opponents from the A/J inbred strain. Resource-holding potential was assessed through body weight gains and territory ownership. The STRA males were shown to be aggressive in both neutral cage and resident-intruder tests. On the contrary, the BUSNA males were less aggressive in all tests. We did not find a significant effect of postnatal maternal environment; however, we detected significant maternal effect on body weight with differences between the strains, fostering type and interactions between these factors. We conclude that the aggressiveness preserved in the two strains has significant genetic component whose genetic basis can be dissected by quantitative trait loci analysis. Aggr.

The M. musculus is polygynous and females tend to breed cooperatively while M. spicilegus is known to be monogamous and famous for its unique cooperative behavior; the communal overwintering. Mus spicilegus is considered as a highly aggressive species in the genus Mus . In the present study, we attempted to analyze the development of aggressive and sociable behavior in these species and to discover how familiarity with the target moderates the development of sociable and aggressive behaviors and moderates the differences between the species. Dyadic social interaction tests in neutral cages were performed on 21‐, 60‐, and 120‐day‐old mice of both genders and both species. Each individual was tested against a sibling and an unfamiliar individual at all three ages. Our results showed that the development of aggressive and sociable behavior with age differed between the species and sexes; however, familiarity with the other mouse moderated the effect of species on aggression. At 21 days, both genders of M. spicilegus were more aggressive against strangers than siblings. This became true of both species at 60 days. When facing a stranger, both sexes of M. spicilegus were more aggressive than M. musculus at 120 days. However, when facing a sibling, neither gender of M. spicilegus was more agonistic than M. musculus , indicating that either kinship or early social experiences elicit tolerance. Aggr.

A non‐recursive structural equation model revealed that reading aggression in books was positively associated with aggressive behavior, even after controlling for exposure to aggression in other forms of media. Associations were only found for congruent forms of aggression. Implications regarding books as a form of media are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 39:493–502, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Potential items were selected from existing measures. A sample of 653 British university students completed all items, and their responses were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and validated with confirmatory factor analysis. There were five separate factors (general violence, drug‐related offenses, partner violence, theft, and criminal damage), which were confirmed with acceptable fit indices. The five‐factor model applied to both males and females. Each subscale demonstrated good internal consistency, with alphas for each factor ranging from moderate to good. This new measure is a potentially valuable research tool for investigating people's involvement in violent and non‐violent offending. The importance of examining the psychometric properties of scales, and confirming the category groupings using CFA of the items is outlined. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period with high vulnerability to sleep problems. However, research identifying distinct patterns and underlying determinants of sleep problems is scarce. This study investigated discrete subgroups of, changes in, and stability of sleep problems. We also examined whether peer victimization influenced sleep problem subgroups and transitions in patterns of sleep problems from late adolescence to young adulthood. Sex differences in the effects of peer victimization were also explored. In total, 1,455 male and 1,399 female adolescents from northern Taiwan participated in this longitudinal study. Latent transition analysis was used to examine changes in patterns of sleep problems and the effects of peer victimization on these changes. We identified three subgroups of sleep problems in males and two in females, and found that there was a certain level of instability in patterns of sleep problems during the study period. For both sexes, those with greater increases in peer victimization over time were more likely to change from being a good sleeper to a poor sleeper. The effects of peer victimization on baseline status of sleep problems, however, was only significant for males, with those exposed to higher levels of peer victimization more likely to be poor sleepers at baseline. Our findings reveal an important role of peer victimization in predicting transitions in patterns of sleep problems. Intervention programs aimed at decreasing peer victimization may help reduce the development and escalation of sleep problems among adolescents, especially in males.",

There exist no viable, brief screening tools to facilitate the rapid and early identification of IPV perpetration. The development of a brief IPV screening tool would reduce participant burden and compensation in research as well as aid in self‐identification and appropriate consultation for treatment. Three samples were recruited and administered an IPV assessment measure. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to determine a critical subset of items that could be rapidly administered and used to accurately detect physical IPV perpetrators. A set of four items emerged that were capable of differentiating between partner violent and nonviolent participants in Samples 1 (the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) = .95, SE = .02), 2 (AUC = .98, SE =.01), and 3 (AUC = .94, SE = .04). Internal consistency of the screening items was acceptable across samples and the scores on the screening tool were significantly associated in the expected direction with all assessed risk factors for IPV. Initial evaluation of the rapid IPV perpetration screening tool suggests that it may help satisfy the growing need to quickly determine research eligibility and to help college students self‐identify risk, offering objective data upon which to base the decision for follow‐up consultation.",

This study extends past theory and research by examining the acute effects of alcohol on men's decisions about how to respond to sexual refusals in a dating simulation. Men ( N = 62) ages 21–29 were randomly assigned to consume alcohol (target breath alcohol level 0.080%) or no alcohol. Participants were encouraged to talk to a simulated woman and act as they would on an actual date. They made choices from a list which included nonsexual and sexual options. The female agent was programmed to engage in some sexual activities but refuse others. Refusals became more intense if participants persisted. Negative binomial regression analysis was used to test a path analytic model. As predicted, participants' self‐reported desire to have sex was positively associated with choosing more consensual sexual activities during the simulation (i.e., activities in which the woman willingly engaged). Consensual sexual activities were positively associated with the number of times participants persisted after the woman refused. Alcohol moderated this relationship such that it was stronger for intoxicated men than sober men. The more sexual refusals participants received, the more hostile verbal comments they made to the woman. Contrary to our predictions, this relationship was not moderated by alcohol condition. Because participants had multiple opportunities to escalate their aggression or desist, this paradigm provides new insights into the mechanisms through which intoxication enhances the likelihood of sexual aggression in dating situations.",

Consistent with hypotheses based on theory and research linking bullying and aggression to intrasexual competition for mates, results indicated that cyber victimization was positively associated with a number of dating and sexual partners. Findings for cyber aggression were more complex, depending on the degree of cyber victimization experienced by the perpetrator, and the balance of power between the perpetrator and victim. Specifically, nonbullying cyber aggression by perpetrators with equal or less power than the victim had stronger positive relations with the number of dating or sexual partners when perpetrators experienced a high level of cyber victimhood. In contrast, cyberbullying by perpetrators with more power than the victim was negatively associated with the number of dating partners when the perpetrators’ exposure to cyber victimization was low. Although cyber aggression and cyber victimization are new forms of aggression that involve the use of modern electronic devices, the results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of viewing this behavior from an evolutionary perspective and show that adolescents are likely to use cyber aggression against rivals in the context of intrasexual competition for mates.",

    "abstract": "A dearth of literature has examined the consequences of women's use of aggression in intimate relationships. Women's use of aggression against their intimate partners, regardless of their motivation (e.g., self‐defense, retaliation), may elicit shame. Shame, in turn, may contribute to the maintenance and/or exacerbation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, which are commonly experienced in this population. Further, emerging research suggests that emotionally avoidant coping strategies, such as substance use, may strengthen the relation between shame and PTSD symptoms. The goal of the present study was to examine whether women's shame concerning their use of intimate partner aggression is associated with their PTSD symptoms, and whether drug and alcohol use problems moderate this association. Participants were 369 community women who had used and been victimized by physical aggression in an intimate relationship with a male partner in the past six months. The intimate partner aggression‐related shame × drug (but not alcohol) use problems interaction on PTSD symptom severity was significant. Analysis of simple slopes revealed that women's intimate partner aggression‐related shame was positively associated with their PTSD symptoms when drug use problems were high, but not when drug use problems were low. Findings have implications for the potential utility of PTSD treatments targeting a reduction in shame and maladaptive shame regulation strategies (i.e., drug use) in this population. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract While the association between heavy alcohol consumption and aggression has been well documented, the causal direction of this association, particularly at a population level, is disputed. A number of causal sequences have been proposed. First, that aggression leads to heavy alcohol use. Second, that heavy alcohol use leads to aggression. Third, that the association between alcohol use and aggression is due to confounding by (a) sociodemographic variables or (b) delinquency. We report here data from four Australasian prospective longitudinal studies of adolescents, to assess the temporal sequence of heavy drinking and aggression over the period from adolescence to young adulthood. The four cohort studies provide a total sample of 6,706 persons (Australian Temperament Project, n = 1701; Christchurch Health and Development Study, n = 931; Mater‐University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy, n = 2437; Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study, n = 1637). We use multinomial logistic regression to determine whether early adolescent aggression predicts subsequent age of onset of heavy episodic drinking (HED), after adjustment for concurrent sociodemographic factors and delinquency. We then consider whether HED predicts subsequent aggression, after adjusting for past aggression, concurrent delinquency, and a range of confounders. There are broadly consistent findings across the four cohort studies. Early aggression strongly predicts subsequent HED. HED predicts later aggression after adjustment for prior aggression and other confounders. Policies that alter population levels of alcohol consumption are likely to impact on levels of aggression in societies where HED linked to aggression is more common.",

    "abstract": "People often have to make decisions between immediate rewards and more long-term goals. Such intertemporal judgments are often investigated in the context of monetary choice or drug use, yet not in regard to aggressive behavior. We combined a novel intertemporal aggression paradigm with functional neuroimaging to examine the role of temporal delay in aggressive behavior and the neural correlates thereof. Sixty-one participants (aged 18-22 years; 37 females) exhibited substantial variability in the extent to which they selected immediate acts of lesser aggression versus delayed acts of greater aggression against a same-sex opponent. Choosing delayed-yet-more-severe aggression was increased by provocation and associated with greater self-control. Preferences for delayed aggression were associated with greater activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) during such choices, and reduced functional connectivity between the VMPFC and brain regions implicated in motor impulsivity. Preferences for immediate aggression were associated with reduced functional connectivity between the VMPFC and the frontoparietal control network. Dispositionally aggressive participants exhibited reduced VMPFC activity, which partially explained and suppressed their preferences for delayed aggression. Blunted VMPFC activity may thus be a neural mechanism that promotes reactive aggression towards provocateurs among dispositionally aggressive individuals. These findings demonstrate the utility of an intertemporal framework for investigating aggression and provide further evidence for the similar underlying neurobiology between aggression and other rewarding behaviors.",

We compared the punishment intensity selected by the participant before and after seeing the offender's reaction. Seeing the opponent in pain reduced subsequent punishment most strongly, while displays of sadness and verbal indications of suffering had no appeasing effect. Expression of anger about a retributive punishment did not increase revenge seeking relative to a calm reaction, even when the anger response was disambiguated as being angry with the punisher.

However, accommodation and inhibition may be difficult when self‐control strength is weak or depleted by prior exertion of self‐control. The present study considered whether state self‐control depletion prospectively predicts male and female self‐reports of anger with partner and arguing with partner. Consistent with the I 3 Model (Finkel, 2014, Adv Exp Soc Psychol, 49 , 1–104), we also considered whether the association between elevated anger and arguing (i.e., instigation) and partner aggression was stronger when state self‐control (i.e., inhibition) was depleted or among people high in negative urgency. In this ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study, heavy drinking married and cohabiting heterosexual couples ( N = 191) responded to three randomly signaled reports each day for 30 days. Depletion predicted anger and arguing with partners both cross‐sectionally and prospectively for men and women. However, after controlling for prior levels of anger and arguing, these effects were diminished, and supplemental analyses revealed that anger and arguing with partner predicted subsequent depletion. Anger and arguing were strongly associated with concurrent reports of partner aggression perpetration and victimization (verbal and/or physical). However, neither state self‐control depletion nor negative urgency moderated these effects. Overall, results suggest a modest impact of depletion on daily couple functioning as well as a potential cyclical effect of arguing on depletion.",

Using the victim's gender as a proxy for coercive power, we analyzed violent incidents from the National Incident‐Based Reporting System (2005–2014). The sample included over six million assaults, robberies, and homicides. Consistent with adversary effects, offenders who attack males (vs. females) are more likely to (a) kill victims; (b) use guns, knives, blunt objects, poison, and automobiles; (c) use male (but not female) allies; and (d) use multiple allies. The evidence for target choice is mixed: unarmed female offenders, but not unarmed male offenders, are more likely to target females than males. The evidence shows how a simple theoretical principle can parsimoniously account for basic patterns of violence in society related to gender, weapons, and group violence.",

There was a significant interaction between quadratic bias and peer rejection predicting reactive physical aggression; rejected children with a positive bias or a negative bias were highest in reactive physical aggression. The interaction between linear bias, social dominance goals, and the sex of the child was also significant when predicting proactive physical aggression. Among girls who highly valued social dominance, a positive bias predicted greater proactive physical aggression. Results are discussed in terms of implications for aggression theory and intervention.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aggression in correctional and psychiatric settings is relatively common and has a negative effect on physical and mental health both among inmates/clients and staff, as well as organizational‐level functioning. The aim of the present study was to critically review the evidence on the effectiveness of nutritional supplements in reducing aggression and violence to contribute to a better understanding of options available for managing aggressive behaviors in adults. The EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases were searched for effectiveness studies published in English anytime up until March 2020. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Altogether, 14 studies met inclusion criteria; 2 investigated micronutrients, 10 examined macronutrients, while further 2 examined a combination of micro and macronutrients. Out of the 14 studies, 5 reported a beneficial effect of nutritional supplementation (omega‐3 fatty acids, vitamins/minerals, S‐adenosyl‐ l ‐methionine, or tryptophan). Five studies did not report a significant beneficial effect of nutritional supplementation (omega‐3 fatty acids, folic acid, tryptophan, broad range supplement containing vitamins and fatty acids, and fatty acids in augmentation with valproic acid), while four studies reported mixed effects (on l ‐tryptophan, broad‐range micronutrient formula, folic acid, and omega‐3 fatty acids). The results overall indicated that research in this area is in its infancy: very few studies examined the same composition of nutritional supplementation and when they did so the results were contradictory. The methodological shortcoming of existing studies and directions for future research are discussed to facilitate high‐quality research in this evolving area of nutritional psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Literature linking aggressive behavior across internalizing and externalizing disorders support the co‐occurrence of aggression and various mental health diagnoses. However, research has yet to examine relationships between aggression and dimensional psychopathology models that cut across diagnostic boundaries (e.g., internalizing, externalizing composites) and capture shared liability across common disorders. The role of gender has also been largely ignored in prior work, despite evidence that men and women manifest psychopathology differently. The present study examined cross‐sectional and longitudinal relationships between psychopathology composites (i.e., Internalizing, Externalizing) and different manifestations of physical aggression (i.e., aggressive traits, general violence, physical intimate partner violence, and self‐directed aggression), as well as moderation by gender. Internalizing (INT) and Externalizing (EXT) lifetime symptoms and various physically aggressive behaviors were assessed at baseline and at 6 months and 1 year follow up in a sample of 319 adults with violence and/or substance use histories. Cross‐sectional results showed that INT was associated with all forms of aggression, and women showed stronger relationships between INT and both physical intimate partner violence (IPV) and self‐directed aggression. EXT was specifically linked to general violence, and a stronger relationship between EXT and self‐directed aggression emerged in men compared to women. Longitudinal relationships were mostly small and nonsignificant. Results support the co‐occurrence of aggression with distinct forms of psychopathology, as well as gender‐dependent relationships, but do not support the predictive validity of symptom composites in aggression risk. Findings implicate the need for aggression interventions tailored within gender.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Violent ideations are increasingly recognized as an important psychological predictor for aggressive and violent behavior. However, little is known about the processes that contribute to violent ideations. This paper examines the extent to which polyvictimization triggers violent ideations in late adolescence and early adulthood, while also adjusting for dispositional and situational factors as well as prior violent ideations. Data came from three waves of the Zurich Project on the Social Development from Childhood into Adulthood (z‐proso; n = 1465). Full‐information maximum likelihood Tobit models were fitted to regress violent ideations experienced at ages 17 and 20 on multiple victimization experiences in the preceding 12 months while controlling for antecedent developmental risk factors and prior violent ideations. The results showed that violent ideations in late adolescence and early adulthood are influenced by violent thoughts, aggressive behavior, violent media consumption, moral neutralization of violence, and internalizing symptoms measured 2 years earlier. Experiences of polyvictimization significantly contributed to an increase in violent ideations both during late adolescence and in early adulthood. The exposure–response relationship between victimization and violent ideations did not significantly differ by sex. The findings are consistent with the notion that violent ideations are triggered by a retaliation‐linked psychological mechanism that entails playing out other directed imaginary aggressive scenarios specifically in response to experiencing intentional harm‐doing by others.",

To understand how the same parenting behavior is associated with three different types of bulling involvement, we examined the moderating roles of children's inhibitory control and sex. In addition, we differentiated between mothers’ and fathers’ harsh parenting. We analyzed multi‐informant questionnaire data from 2131 families participating in the Dutch Generation R birth cohort study. When children were three years old, parents reported on their own harsh parenting practices. When children were four, mothers reported on their children's inhibitory control. At child age six, teachers reported on children's bullying involvement. Our results revealed that fathers’, and not mothers’, harsh parenting increased the odds of being a perpetrator. No moderation effects with children's inhibitory control and sex were found for the likelihood of being a perpetrator. Moderation effects were present for the likelihood of being a target and a perpetrator‐target, albeit only with mothers’ harsh parenting. Specifically, for boys with lower‐level inhibitory control problems, mothers’ harsh parenting increased the odds of being a target. In contrast, for boys with higher‐level inhibitory control problems, mothers’ harsh parenting decreased the odds of being a target. Furthermore, for girls with higher‐level inhibitory control problems, mothers’ harsh parenting increased the odds of being a perpetrator‐target. Overall, our results underscore the importance of differentiating by children's cognitive skills and by parent and child sex to fully understand how harsh parenting and bullying involvement are related.",

At the same time, epistemological differences in theoretical approaches to the subject (i.e., evolutionary, feminist) have stymied the study of the topic from multiple perspectives. Informed by feminist and evolutionary perspectives and research on individual differences, this study examined interactions between intermale status challenge and psychopathic personality traits on a laboratory analog of sexually aggressive behaviors among 139 heterosexual men (average 21 years old, 64% white, 26% Hispanic). Results suggest multiple pathways to sexual aggression, with the strongest evidence for the role of interpersonal‐affective psychopathic traits in sexual aggression following a competition win, but not loss. Results are discussed to emphasize the importance of both individual‐level variables and interpersonal social contexts in shaping sexual aggression behavior.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Prior research suggests that multiple‐perpetrator sexual violence (e.g., gang rape) is very rare—reported by less than 2% of individuals. However, these estimates may be outdated and biased by measurement. The goal of this study was to explore the prevalence of multiple‐perpetrator sexual violence and ways to measure it. Data were aggregated across several studies that shared similar methodology in recruiting online, anonymous samples of adults (Table 1). Study 1 evaluated victimization across five samples of 2491 participants. Study 2 evaluated perpetration across four samples of 2699 participants. All participants completed questionnaires in a randomized order. Reported prevalence rates for victimization were higher than prior research (1.5%) and ranged between 2.8% and 10.9% (Table 2) with an average of 4.86% (see Table 3). Multiple‐perpetrator victimization items were significantly correlated with other victimization items suggesting validity, phi = 0.182–0.371. Reported prevalence rates of perpetration ranged from 0.8 to 18.9% with an average of 6.43%. Multiple‐perpetrator perpetration items were significantly correlated with other perpetration items, suggesting validity, phi = 0.190–0.582. Our findings suggest that multiple‐perpetrator sexual violence is more common than previously suggested. Psychometric analyses suggest initial validity, utility, and acceptability for all examined measures that should be further investigated in primary data collections.",

Between-group comparisons assume measurement equality. We examine this assumption of measurement equality using a MixIRT analysis, which combines a latent profile analysis with a Rating Scale Model Item Response Theory analysis to determine whether sexual aggressors and victims can be divided into latent classes and whether the latent traits of sexual aggression or victimization have configural, metric and scalar equivalence and through an examination of differential item functioning (DIF). This is a secondary analysis of 3746 Israeli adolescents responding to a self-report questionnaire regarding sexual aggression and victimization. Data analyses proceeded in five steps, and the unit of analysis was each respondent's responses to the aggressor and victim scales. We conducted a series of exploratory and confirmatory analyses of the aggression/victimization scale to examine configural equivalence, followed by a series of Latent Profile Analyses to determine metric and scalar equivalence. Finally, we examined DIF and Wright Maps using a Rating Scale IRT model. Four latent classes were identified. All items showed configural equivalence and most exhibited metric and scalar equivalence. An examination of DIF and Wright Maps showed that the structures of the latent traits for each latent class were fairly similar. However, for all latent classes, measures of sexual aggression and victimization failed to sample the full range of item difficulty (or endorseability).",

However, whether there exists a reciprocal longitudinal relation between them needs to be examined. In this longitudinal study, we tested the reciprocal impacts of parental conflict and aggressive behavior, considering the role of poor family functioning in these two aspect. Three measurements were conducted on 540 adolescents ( M age = 12.57, SD = 0.68) in China, with a 6‐month interval for each measurement. The first measurement was conducted in September 2022, the second in March 2023, and the third in September 2023. Adolescents' perception of the interparental conflict scale, family assessment device functioning scale, and direct and indirect aggression scale were used. Parental conflict at Waves 1 and 2 positively predicted poor family functioning and aggressive behavior at Waves 2 and 3, respectively. Poor family functioning at Waves 1 and 2 positively predicted aggressive behavior at Waves 2 and 3, while aggressive behavior at Waves 1 and 2 positively predicted poor family functioning at Waves 2 and 3. These results indicated the reciprocal relationship between poor family functioning and aggressive behavior. Additionally, the mediation analysis revealed that poor family functioning at Wave 2 serves as a mediator in the unidirectional association between parental conflict at Wave 1 and aggressive behavior at Wave 3. These findings indicated that poor family functioning partially accounts for the unidirectional predictive relationship between parental conflict and aggressive behavior over time. Consequently, the results provide valuable insights for reducing aggressive behavior.",

Participants ( N = 371) experienced either Low Social Validation or High Social Validation in a simulated social media context. After reporting their emotions, they sent “Dislikes” and “Likes” to either the Same Peers (i.e., direct responses) who had given social feedback or to Different Peers (i.e., displaced responses). Results showed that narcissistic rivalry predicted more narcissistic rage following Low Social Validation, which subsequently predicted more “Dislikes” and fewer “Likes” toward both Same Peers and Different Peers. Narcissistic admiration predicted both more “Dislikes” and more “Likes” via pride across social feedback and peer group conditions. This study suggests that narcissistic rage stemming from narcissistic rivalry accounts for aggression following social failures, while pride stemming from narcissistic admiration accounts for prosociality regardless of social feedback experiences.",

The neural regulation of territorial aggression in females has been little explored, despite the fact they can be as territorial as males. In this study using the c‐Fos protein as a marker of neural activity, we analysed whether mPOA, BNST, AHN, VMH, and MeA are activated after an aggressive encounter in the female Djungarian hamster ( Phodopus campbelli ). Twenty females and 20 males were paired for 15 days. Mating was used as a factor in induced territoriality. The couples were organized into two groups with 10 couples each; in 10 of these pairs, females were subjected to resident intruder tests, while in the other 10 pairs, the females were not confronted. Before mating the males of both groups were vasectomized to prevent that their partners from becoming pregnant. This was done to separate territorial aggression from maternal aggression. All females Djungarian hamster subjected to resident intruder tests displayed territorial aggression. The results of this study showed that mPOA, BNST, VMH, AHN, and MeA were activated in confronted females of Djungarian hamster. In male rodents, these neuronal nuclei are also activated after confrontation, supporting the hypothesis that there is a homology at the neural level in the regulation of aggressive behavior between males and females.",

However, research evaluating developmental trends in specific acts of aggression across measures is limited, particularly in early childhood. A better understanding of what specific acts of aggression are more common in early childhood could inform assessment and identify specific behavioral targets for early prevention and intervention efforts. The current study advances extant literature by examining teacher reported rates of specific acts of aggression in samples of early childhood youth from United States and Aotearoa New Zealand. Specifically, in the U.S. sample ( N = 322, 56.5% male), differences in rates in specific acts of physical and relational aggression (and gender differences) were compared across preschool, kindergarten, and first grade. To further evaluate specific acts of aggression in early childhood, the New Zealand sample ( N = 200, 51.5% male) examined age differences in preschoolers (2‐, 3‐, 4‐, and 5‐year‐olds) on acts of aggression delineated by both form (physical and relational) and function (proactive and reactive) as well as gender differences. Utilizing different measures, findings indicated that while acts of aggression that require more cognitive and verbal skills occurred at high rates among older youth, overall, percentages of physical aggression were consistent across ages/grade in both early childhood samples. Boys exhibited higher percentages of physical aggression than girls, as expected. However, gender differences in relational aggression were not consistent across the samples. Data from both countries support the importance of examining specific acts of aggression.",

The current study used a manipulation-of-attention task to test the causal role of attentional biases in children's appraisal of ambiguous provocations. Sixty-six 4th- through 7th-grade children (30 boys; Mage = 11.5 years) viewed video clips of ambiguous provocation after being cued to maintain visual attention on either the provocateur or victim and answered questions measuring hostile intent attribution and expected anger of the victim. Data were also collected regarding the children's aggressive behavior and peer victimization. Results showed that directing attention to the provocateur when watching scenes of ambiguous physical provocation led to less hostile interpretations and lower anger scores, as compared to when attention was directed to the victim. Additional analyses suggested that this effect was specific to children who were high in physical peer victimization, particularly when they were also high in reactive aggression. This study has important implications for understanding how automatic processing of information contributes to the development of anger and aggression.",

It is unclear whether high or low power relates to psychological aggression and under which circumstances. We tested psychopathy as a potential moderator in the power‐aggression link because psychopathy is characterized by a lack of empathy and shallow emotional response. Psychopathy could strengthen the link between high power and psychological aggression because power ignites character traits and their corresponding behavior. Alternatively, psychopathy could strengthen the link between low power and psychological aggression because individuals high in psychopathy may attempt to compensate for their lack of power with aggression. We tested these competing hypotheses in a romantic context across two studies ( N 1 = 188 individuals, N 2 = 226 couples). We found power to be negatively related to both actors' and partners' psychological aggression. Supporting the latter hypothesis, we found that the most psychologically aggressive people had low power and high psychopathy. In addition, people reported high psychological aggression when their partners were low in power and high in psychopathy. These findings advance existing power theories and research by highlighting how personality traits such as psychopathy affect both intra‐ and interpersonal links to psychological aggression.",

Therefore, this study utilized a longitudinal Actor-Partner Interdependence Mediation Model (APIMeM) to track 627 pairs of parents of fourth-grade elementary school students (fathers: M_age = 35.06 years, SD = 5.80; mothers: M_age = 33.09 years, SD = 5.89) over a 2-year period with three assessments. The aim was to examine the relationship between Child-Invested Contingent Self-Esteem (CCSE) and parental maltreatment, and to explore the potential mediating role of emotional dysregulation. The results indicated that parental CCSE significantly predicted their own maltreatment behaviors and directly predict their partner's maltreatment behaviors. Emotional dysregulation mediated the relationship between CCSE and parental maltreatment: parents' CCSE influenced their partner's emotional dysregulation, which in turn affected their own maltreatment behaviors. Simultaneously, parents' CCSE influenced their own emotional dysregulation, which indirectly affected their partner's maltreatment behaviors. This study provides a novel understanding of the mechanisms underlying parental maltreatment from the perspectives of CCSE and emotional dysregulation, highlighting the key role of parental interaction patterns and emotional transmission in the occurrence of family violence. These findings offer empirical support for the development of effective parental maltreatment prevention and intervention strategies that are culturally tailored to the Chinese context.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although previous research has examined the impact of stress on aggressive behavior, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. In particular, the mediating roles of sleep quality and social bonds have received limited attention within the context of Chinese society. Drawing on data from 2140 Chinese high school seniors, this study investigates the relationships between stress, sleep quality, social bonds, and aggressive behavior. The results revealed significant associations: stress positively correlated with aggressive behavior and negatively with sleep quality and social bonds, while sleep quality and social bonds were negatively related. Moreover, multiple mediation analyses demonstrated that stress predicted aggression both directly and indirectly through the mediating effects of sleep quality and social bonds. These relationships remained significant after controlling for demographic variables. To further validate these findings, qualitative interviews were conducted until data saturation was reached, reinforcing the proposed mediation pathways and offering deeper insights into the mechanisms involved. The findings are consistent with general strain theory and social bond theory, suggesting that elevated stress and weakened social bonds, either directly or indirectly, contribute to delinquent behavior such as aggression. This study extends existing theoretical frameworks by emphasizing the pivotal mediating roles of sleep quality and social bonds and offers practical implications for reducing adolescent aggression. Furthermore, these research results underscore the importance of targeted interventions aimed at improving sleep quality and strengthening social bonds to mitigate the negative effects of stress on adolescent mental health and behavior.",

Problem-solving strategies were aggregated into three broad dimensions: 1) aggressive/antisocial solutions; 2) nonverbal-nonaggressive solutions; and 3) verbal-nonaggressive solutions. Compared to ODD boys, CD boys proposed more aggressive/antisocial solutions in parent-child conflicts when parental intent was ambiguous and in teacher-child conflicts regardless of intent. Compared to ODD boys, CD boys proposed fewer verbal-nonaggressive solutions in child-child conflicts.

Negative emotions (threat, harm) and positive emotions (benefit, challenge) were assessed at four times during the experimental task. The results revealed that both aggressive responding and harm emotions differed as a function of opponent's level of provocation.

These aspects are the provision of a sound descriptive base and the application of the principle of natural selection. Description requires more than cataloging, and is best aided by quantitative data. Three examples from aggression research are used to illustrate problems generated by lack of attention to these principles: 1) imitation of aggression by children, 2) pain-induced aggression in rats and 3) measures of spousal violence. The principle of natural selection can be used to re-interpret existing data sources and to generate new ones.

We observed a herd of approximately 100 red deer (Cervus elaphus) and 130 fallow deer (Dama dama) at the Žehušice Deer Park during supplemental feeding to determine whether fallow deer can displace red deer at feeding sites and to describe strategies used for displacement. Data were analyzed during the antlered period (AP) when males of both species had hard antlers and the cast period (CP) when all red deer stags had cast antlers, but fallow bucks were still in a hard antler. We conducted 41 observation sessions, 29 during the AP and 12 during the CP. In both periods red deer were more numerous than fallow deer at the feeding sites. Fallow bucks initially waited until red deer arrived at the feeding site, after which they attacked any red deer. Fallow bucks were more aggressive than red deer stags or hinds. When stags retaliated, the bucks turned their attacks toward hinds. During feeding sessions, attacks against hinds intensified, while bucks avoided encounters with stags. As a result, in most cases (90%), red deer vacated the feeding site before the supplementary food was depleted. In contrast, fallow does not compete with the larger red deer and selected other sources of food in the park. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This paper summarizes major research achievements concerning the understanding and control of aggression and destructive violence, seen in the contexts of evolution (both biological and cultural) and systems theory. Agonistic behavior, defined as behavior functional in situations of conflict between species mates, most probably evolved out of the function of defensive behavior but has since acquired a variety of other adaptive functions as well as the potential for destructive dysfunction. Recent research demonstrates the importance of culture in regulating human agonistic behavior, directing it toward either useful functions or destructive violence. Among advanced industrial nations, the United States has the most severe problems with violence as measured by homicide and murder rates. Similar but more extreme variation can be found among tribal societies. It is through cultural change that the available scientific information concerning improved methods for directing agonistic behavior into positive and beneficial channels must be achieved. Therefore, major emphasis should be placed on research dealing with human cultural evolution. The science of bringing about desirable social change is still in its infancy.",

Aggres Behav 25:162–178] that addressed the level of bullying behaviour at their present institution. Prisoners also completed a questionnaire that measured social self‐esteem (Texas Social Behaviour Inventory) [Helmreich R, Stapp J. 1974. Bull Psychonomic Soc 4:473–475]. Four categories of prisoners were compared: bullies, victims, those who reported both bullying others and being victimised themselves (bully/victims), and those who were not involved in bullying behaviour. There were no significant differences among bully categories in total self‐esteem scores. Men reported significantly higher levels of self‐esteem than did women. There were no significant sex or bully category differences in certainty of self‐esteem. Self‐esteem was found to include a number of individual components that differed between the sexes.

Second-, third-, fifth-, and sixth-grade girls evaluated four relational aggression conflict scenarios in terms of attributions of aggressor's intentions, evaluator's behavioral response, evaluator's affective state, and how likely the situation was to actually occur. Girls evaluated intentions of a best friend more positively, reported being more mad at an enemy, and perceived conflict to be more likely to occur with an enemy than a best friend. Aggressor intentions in direct conflict scenarios (aggressor said something mean to evaluator) were perceived as more negative than aggressor intentions in indirect conflict scenarios (aggressor said something mean about evaluator to another peer). Younger girls reported intentions of their enemy as being more positive than did older girls. Further, older girls reported intentions of their best friend as being more positive than intentions of their enemy. Older girls also were more accurate in conceptualizing variations in the conflict setting (direct, indirect) and responding in a context-consistent manner. Findings are discussed in terms of the social-relational and social-situational processes that influence children's evaluations of relational aggression and how the current study extends previous research on relational aggression.

It was predicted that homeowners who violate stereotypical norms would be perceived more negatively, and would be perceived as more responsible for the consequences of their weapon use than would homeowners of both genders who represent stereotype-consistency. The data from the first experiment provided some support for this notion. Male homeowners who shot incompetently were perceived more negatively than were men who shot the intruder with competence. The opposite trend was observed for female homeowners. The second experiment tested a refinement of this hypothesis and revealed how attitudes toward guns, specifically degree of acceptance of the notion that guns provide their owners with protection, moderates the social judgments formed about homeowners who use weapons as a means of defending their property during a burglary, Persons for whom the event is inconsistent with their attitude-based expectancies blamed the stereotype-inconsistent homeowners more than the gender stereotype-consistent homeowners, particularly the skillful female shooters. Individuals with relatively negative attitudes toward guns, in contrast, tended to perceive the skillful female shooters more positively than the other homeowners. Perceptions of weapons users who find themselves and their actions scrutinized by the media and the court system may depend upon perceivers' pre-existing category expectations and attitudes. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Path analyses were aimed at finding out which of the five circulating hormones might best predict a latent aggression construct derived from the four subscales of the Aggression Questionnaire.

This article examines economic exchange and reciprocity in two societies that are very similar in their ecological contexts, modes of subsistence, technologies, and social organizations but at opposite extremes in their attitudes toward violence. They are the Semai of Malaysia, one of the most peaceful societies known, and the Waorani of Amazonian Ecuador, the most violent society yet described. Comparison of the norms of exchange in these two societies reveals two very different views of the world: The Semai see themselves as helpless in a hostile world that is beyond their control and the Waorani see themselves as self-reliant and capable in a world that they feel fully competent to control. Understanding these culturally constructed realities as they are embodied in Semai and Waorani exchange (and in other areas of life as well, of course) contributes to an understanding of the character of sociality generally in these two societies, including their diametrically opposed dispositions toward violence in human relations.

The feelings of anger experience were higher than the readiness to action in all the samples. This difference between both variables was higher in females than in males, as well as in the Spanish sample compared with the Japanese one. An intragroup analysis in each sex in each country showed that the relative differences between males and females were similar in both countries. These constant differences between both sexes seem to be independent of the cultural context. Aggr. Behav. 28:429–438, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Sixty adolescent boys and girls completed a modified Taylor aggression paradigm in which verbally offensive remarks were sent and received. Results showed (a) that during increasing levels of provocation, verbal aggression increased on both winning and losing trials, (b) that verbal aggression decreased during decreasing levels of provocation but only on losing trials, and (c) that difficulties on two measures of executive functioning were related to verbal aggression, but only in the context of increasing verbal provocation. Individuals with executive functioning difficulties responded with more verbal aggression than did individuals with less severe executive functioning difficulties. Results have implications for the manner in which provocation is studied and for understanding the conditions in which executive functioning difficulties contribute to verbal aggression. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Aggression occurring during an initial confrontation between two rats may result in significant behavioral changes in one or both animals. The present experiment was designed to study behavioral changes occurring in the course of an agonistic interaction and the consequences of winning or losing. In order to ensure winning, male CPB-S3 Tryon Maze Dull) rats were confronted with males of a more aggressive strain (Long Evans); and to ensure losing they were confronted with those of a less aggressive strain Wistar). Winners were tested against losers, this test being repeated after an interval of 17 days. Winners and losers were also tested with naive S3 opponents. Possible effects of winning and losing in nonagonistic behavioral tests were then examined. These measured open field activity, passive avoidance learning, and masculine sexual behavior. The results replicate and extend earlier findings using a different strain, indicating that significant and relatively permanent behavioral changes are induced in male winners and losers. Behavioral change is most prominent in the losers. Despite the behavioral differences between winners and losers in tests for agonistic behavior, no consistent differences were noted in any of the other behavioral tests.",

The prey-specific effect of fluprazine did not seem to result from a decreased tendency to attack nor was its effect restricted to prey showing characteristic rodent defensive responses.

    "abstract": "In the studies presented in this article, we have described the role of opioid peptides in the regulation of feline aggression. In the first study, stimulation via monopolar electrodes elicited affective defense behavior from the ventromedial hypothalamus and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). After determining response baseline thresholds or latencies, the opioid antagonist naloxone (0.5, 1.0, 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0 mg/kg) was administered systematically. Naloxone significantly reduced the threshold and latency values for this behavior in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but increased response latencies for predatory attack, and had no effect upon PAG-elicited circling behavior. In the next study, intracerebral microinjections of D-Ala2-Met5-enkephalinamide (DAME) at dose levels of 1.0 and 10.0 μg/0.5 μl were placed into the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) and nucleus accumbens via cannula electrodes, and the effects of drug infusion upon affective defense elicited from ventromedial hypothalamus were examined. DAME, when microinjected into the BNST and nucleus accumbens at dose levels of 1.0 and 10.0 μg/0.5 μ1, resulted in 100–300% increases in response latencies. Pretreatment with naloxone completely blocked the suppressive effects of DAME. In a separate study, microinjections of DAME (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/0.5 μ1) into PAG sites from which affective defense was elicited significantly suppressed this behavior. A maximum suppressive effect (87% increase in thresholds) was indicated at the dose level of 1.0 μg/0.5 μ1. Pretreatment with naloxone entirely eliminated the suppressive effects of DAME. In the third study, microinjections of selective agonists and antagonists for mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor subtypes were placed into the PAG sites from which affective defense was elicited. Morphiceptin (a mu agonist) was highly effective in suppressing this response at a very low dose (0.4 nmol). Pretreatment with beta-funaltrexamine (B-FNA), a selective antagonist for mu receptors, completely blocked the suppressive effects of morphiceptin. In addition, a selective delta agonist—[D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE)—also had a suppressive effect upon affective defense behavior, but its effect was of a smaller magnitude relative to that of morphiceptin. Pretreatment with a selective antagonist for delta receptors, ICI 174,864, blocked the suppressive effect of DPDPE. Furthermore, a kappa agonist, U-50488H, failed to alter this behavior. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the opioid peptide system acts as a selective and potent modulator of the affective defense system in the cat. Our findings further suggest that opioid peptides suppress affective defense behavior by acting at synaptic regions within the limbic midbrain which are critical for the expression or modulation of this form of aggressive behavior.",

Comparing the children in different bullying roles in terms of their reactive and proactive aggression, bully-victims were found to be the most aggressive group of all. For this group, it was typical to be highly aggressive both reactively and proactively. Although bullies were significantly less aggressive than bully-victims, they scored higher than victims and controls on both reactive and proactive aggression. However, observations at the person level, i.e., cross-tabulational analyses, indicated that bullies were not only overrepresented among children who were both reactively and procatively aggressive but also among the only reactively aggressive as well as the only proactively aggressive groups. Victims scored higher than control children on reactive aggression, but they were not proactively aggressive.

Sucrose availability did not produce appreciable gains in body weight but it did reliably decrease within-colony weight variation. The results suggest the existence of an effective dietary mechanism that enables a social species such as Rattus norvegicus to tolerate each other in dense feeding aggregations when food is abundant.

We identified 13 categories of situations in which anger was experienced and 11 categories of response to these situations. Anger was experienced in interaction with both high and equal status provokers but of the situations that were identified as producing experiences of anger, nine were reported as occurring differentially in interaction with adults versus peers of the responses to the experience of anger, seven responses were cited differentially in interaction with peers versus adults. The typical responses to adult provoked anger were generally more passive than those to peer provoked anger. Girls more than boys indicated experiencing anger due to adult's task demands but tended to express less overt anger in their interactions with adults than did boys.

Following this model, three types of variables were identified: 1. Measures of stress and social change: to the regular social stressors (i.e., inflation and unemployment), we added two measures of affluence (income per capita and rates of cars) as well as population density. 2. Measures of social support: rates of birth to unmarried mothers and marriage and divorce rates served as measures of the strength of the family. Another measure in this category was rates of psychiatric hospitalization. 3. Measures of violence: in addition to rates of homicide, robbery, and all offenses, inward directed aggression (suicide) was included in this category. At the first stage of the data analysis, Guttman's Smallest Space Analysis (SSA-1) was applied, providing a two-dimensional space diagram of the correlations between the variables. At the second stage, a multiple regression analysis was introduced. The findings indicate that the theoretical model received substantial support mainly from four stress measures (inflation, income per capita, cars, and population density) and one measure of social support (divorce). Unemployment contributed significantly (in the expected direction) only to homicide. Some theoretical implications of the findings, as well as their relevance to some developments in Israeli society are discussed, and suggestions are made for future research.",

To overcome these limitations victim allegations made to the London Metropolitan Police, UK, in 2001, of sexual assault by juvenile stranger perpetrators were sampled. The study aimed to determine more accurately the alleged nature of sex offending by this type of juvenile offender (aged less than 18 years) and to determine what factors were associated with the most serious cases of this type of aggressive behaviour. The most common offence characteristics were identified, and relationships between suspect and offence/victim characteristics were statistically tested. Offence seriousness, as indicated by physical violence and the occurrence of penetration, was significantly associated with an assault by a team of offenders, a young victim, and older juvenile offenders. The potential for predicting offender characteristics from offence characteristics was examined. Estimated offender age was significantly predicted by the absence/presence of penetration. An older juvenile offender was predicted by a penetrative attack. Aggr. Behav. 30:243–253, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Relationships between environmental events and aggression are briefly reviewed. Response-independent pain is a fundamental antecedent environmental cause of attack. Aggression-contingent pain decrease causes further attack strengthening, while pain increase following aggression can decrease attack and foster escape and avoidance behavior. Recent experiments that have questioned the pain-aggression relation and proposed, in the alternative, a pain-defense relationship are discussed. It is argued that this contradiction results from observational difficulties in naturalistic settings, discordance between field and laboratory terminology, substitution of behavioral taxonomy in the place of functional analysis, incomplete understanding of previous findings, and an absence of essential experimental control observations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract As aggressive behavior has a negative impact in general psychiatry, its influence specifically from a gender‐related point of view in an in‐patient population of a psychiatric clinic was assessed at the time of admission. A group of 521 successively admitted psychiatric in‐patients was investigated at admission with the help of the “Social Dysfunction and Aggression Scale”. A slightly higher frequency and intensity of “verbal aggressive behavior” was observed in males. Within the other categories of aggressive behavior (“tension”, “physical violence to things”, and “assaults”), however, the percentages and intensities of gender‐related aggressive behavior did not differ significantly. Furthermore, under the covarying impact of various psychiatric diagnoses, the gender‐related differences concerning the intensity of “verbal aggressive behavior” disappeared. When comparing male and female subgroups, it was notable that male schizophrenic patients were younger than female patients when displaying comparable risks of showing at least one kind of aggressive behavior. In addition, in the female subgroup, “self‐injurious behavior” was more strongly correlated to the category “tension” than in the male subgroup. Although there are some methodological shortcomings, the present results show that there are small qualitative differences in gender‐related aggressive behavior in addition to minimal quantitative differences in the frequency and intensity of “verbal aggressive behavior” at admission.

    "abstract": "This paper has two objectives. The first is to examine the “level of selection” controversy in an historical light, particularly as it relates to the evolution and function of aggressive behaviors. Individual and kin selection, on the one hand, and group selection, on the other, are viewed as alternative scientific paradigms for interpreting aggression and other behaviors. It is suggested that the crux of the conflict between these positions involves different ways of explaining altruism. Often, restraints in fighting are tacitly assumed to function first and foremost for the good of the group or species to the detriment of the actor – ie, to be altruistic and to have evolved by group selection. The frequent use of the group level “good for the species” explanations in various disciplines is noted. A second and overlapping objective of this paper is to present evidence against group selection level interpretations and to propose instead that individual level selection and inclusive fitness theory explain better and provide a heuristically more useful way of examining aggressive behavior. Toward these ends, ritualized aggressive behaviors, formerly assumed to exist for species preservation, are reinterpreted along individualistic lines. Next, the concept of inclusive fitness [Hamilton, 1964] is discussed as a theoretical breakthrough which adds support to an individual level approach. In short, the argument is set forth that animals, by and large, do not kill or seriously injure members of their own species because it usually is not in their genetic self-interest to do so; social patterns of interaction such as aggressive encounters should be examined in terms of their effects on the fitness of the individuals engaging in the behaviors before group adaptations are simply assumed. In illustration, data from several animal behavior studies are discussed. Consideration is also given to instances of intraspecific killing and wounding, which in fact occur much more frequently than has been suggested by members of a group selectionist school of thought. Infant killing reported in lions and various primate species is examined and shown to be explicable through individual selection and inclusive fitness theory. It is concluded that this approach represents a more viable theoretical framework for the evolutionary and functional study of both ritualized and other forms of limited animal aggression as well as more violent incidents of intraspecific wounding and killing.",

    "abstract": "A series of experiments were undertaken to demonstrate the dominance advantage of a territorial resident over an intruder (the prior residence effect) in the adult male Convict Cichlid (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum) and to evaluate the effects of alcohol (ethanol) on this phenomenon. After successfully demonstrating the prior residence effect, additional experiments were conducted in which the resident or intruder was given one of three different doses of ethanol (0.15%, 0.20%, 0.35%). These doses have previously been shown to reduce or increase intraspecific aggression in this species Over the entire dosage range, drugging the intruder produced no changes in the dominance advantage of the resident. However, drugging the resident at the higher doses (0.20%, 0.35%) resulted in loss of the resident's dominance advantage. These effects were not due to impaired locomotor behavior of the drugged fish, as no abnormal motor behaviors were noted. In general, as reported in previous studies, the resident fish, whether drugged or not, typically attacked first. Also as has been previously shown, the fish that attacked (bit) first typically showed eventual dominance. The present results show that the dominance advantage of the territorial resident is not altered by giving an intruder a hypo- or hyperaggression-producing dose of alcohol. Changes in the dominance advantage occur only as a function of drugging the resident, thereby providing evidence that the behavior of the territorial resident is either directly or indirectly (reaction of the intruder to these changes) responsible for the prior residence effect. The present studies also provide some pharmacological approaches for determining the variables important in a laboratory analog of a naturally occurring instance of intraspecific aggression.",

The main findings support the assumptions that escalatory tendencies toward verbal aggression are higher than those toward physical aggression; that escalatory tendencies at work are higher toward lower status workers than toward those of higher status; that escalatory tendencies within the same gender are higher than between genders; and that women tend to escalate more against their spouses than do men.

Because the antiviolent places share biological inheritance, culture, language (Zapotec and Spanish), climate, ecology, poverty, boundary disputes, and abundant use of alcohol with their neighbors, such factors may be discarded as determining either violence or antiviolence. The antiviolent communities do differ from their neighbors, however, in showing a near absence of “machismo,” contrasting practices in child rearing, very few close friendships linking adults of the same sex, and a much stronger social role for women. First results from trials of psychological tests are highly congruent with ethnographic observations.",

On theoretical grounds it is concluded that disaggregations of ecosystems and social systems are more probable and hence more dangerous than those of physiological and genetic systems. Applications of these findings to human affairs are discussed, both as explanations and as guides to positive action.",

We investigated polymorphisms on the male-specific region of the human Y chromosome in 156 unrelated males from the same ethnic background, who were administered the Punjabi translation of the Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire that measures four aspects that constitute aggressive behavior, i.e. physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility. A value of .85 for Cronbach's coefficient alpha indicates considerable internal consistency and suggests that the psychometric properties of the aggression questionnaire can be adapted for the Pakistani population. A mean score+/-SD of 69.70+/-19.95 was obtained for the questionnaire. Each individual was genotyped following a phylogenetic hierarchical approach to define evolutionary Y haplogroups. Five Y haplogroups that are commonly found in Eurasia and Pakistan comprised 87% (n=136) of the population sample, with one haplogroup, R1a1, constituting 55% of the sampled population. A comparison of the total and four subscale mean scores across the five common Y haplogroups that were present at a frequency > or =3% in this ethnic group revealed no overall significant differences. However, effect-size comparisons allowed us to detect an association of the haplogroups R2 (Cohen's d statistic=.448-.732) and R1a1 (d=.107-.448) with lower self-reported aggression mean scores in this population.",

Case–control methods employ an event‐level analysis that can reduce some of these validity threats by the use of within‐subject controls. This study used a case–control approach, asking 39 male inmates in a Young Offenders' Institution to compare drinking behaviour before incidents where they reported commission of an injurious assault and a matched incident where they did not. After controlling contextual differences, participants reported personally drinking more heavily and heavier drinking within their group, but not being more impaired when an assault was committed. The assault incidents were more likely to involve spontaneous, rather than planned, drinking and a higher proportion of males in the group. They were less likely to involve drinking in a pub. Our confirmation of previous findings using a case–control methodology strengthens those findings. Limitations of this methodology are also discussed. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Females of communal and eusocial Hymenoptera differ greatly in the treatment of conspecifics: communal species lack the nest membership–bias treatment via nestmate (NM) recognition, which is typical of eusocial Hymenoptera. Therefore, an analysis of social interactions can suggest whether a given bee or wasp is communal or eusocial. For this reason, we observed females of the digger wasp Cerceris rubida in experimental dyadic encounters. Because this species had previously been labeled “communal,” we expected to find little evidence of a NM bias with respect to cooperation or aggression when paired with NMs and non‐nestmates (NNM). Contrary to expectation, females were highly cooperative toward NMs and highly aggressive toward NNMs. Variation in the intensity of aggression toward NNMs partially stems from the degree to which the paired females differed in size. From these results and quantitative comparisons with studies on solitary, communal, and eusocial bee species, it appears that C. rubida has a more complex social organization than previously believed and, in particular, that females of this species exhibit NM recognition, a trait associated with eusociality.

Accordingly, the main aim of our study was to link early corporal punishment and externalizing behavior to children's physical and relational peer aggression during preadolescence and to examine how these pathways differed by sex. Participants were 193, 3‐year‐old boys (39%) and girls who were reassessed following the transition to kindergarten (5.5 years) and preadolescence (10.5 years). A series of autoregressive, cross‐lagged path analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between child externalizing problems and corporal punishment at ages 3 and 5.5 years, and their association with physical and relational aggression at age 10.5. Multiple group analysis was used to determine whether pathways differed by sex. Three developmental pathways were identified: (i) direct associations between stable childhood externalizing problems and later physical aggression; (ii) a direct pathway from early corporal punishment to preadolescent relational and physical peer aggression; and (iii) an indirect pathway from early corporal punishment to later physical aggression via continuing externalizing problems in middle childhood. Child sex moderated the nature of these pathways, as well as the direction of association between risk and outcome variables. These data advance our understanding of the etiology of distinct forms of peer aggression and highlight the potential for more efficacious prevention and intervention efforts in the early childhood years.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory control and the effects of negative emotional feedback were investigated in adolescents with a history of violent behavior and normal adolescents using the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP), a task simulating real situations of social interaction to elicit aggressive behavior and negative emotions, with concurrent event related potential recordings. The Reactive Proactive Aggression Questionnaire (RPAQ), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and the Negative Mood Regulation (NMR) Scale were also presented. These showed that reactive scores, proactive scores, and BIS scores were all significantly higher for the violent offender group whereas scores from the NMR scale were significantly lower for this group. In the TAP, the violent offender group chose significantly higher levels of punishment, indicative of both higher proactive and higher reactive aggression, for their opponent than did the control group. The ERP data showed the N2 amplitude for the decision phase, indicative of inhibitory control, was lower for the violent offender group than for the control group, with mediation analysis showing that the N2 component was related to proactive aggression. The decision‐related negativity and the feedback‐related negativity in the result phase were also both lower for the violent offender group than for the control group. Adolescent violent offenders showed higher levels of aggressive behavior than normal adolescents. This is associated with both worse inhibitory control and worse negative emotion regulation. Investigation of common factors underlying these processes, in conjunction with possible ways in which they might be improved, should be a priority for future work.",

This underscores the need to identify risk processes that lead to externalizing outcomes. This study examined the extent to which the effects of three dimensions of beliefs supporting aggression on physical aggression and externalizing behavior are mediated by anger dysregulation and callous‐unemotional (CU) traits. Three waves of data were collected from a primarily African American (77%) sample of 265 middle school students between the ages of 11 and 15 (52% were female). We found evidence supporting mediation such that the effects of beliefs supporting instrumental aggression and beliefs that fighting is sometimes necessary at Wave 1 on student‐reported physical aggression at Wave 3 were mediated by CU traits at Wave 2, and relations between beliefs supporting reactive aggression at Wave 1 and teacher‐report of student frequencies of physical aggression and externalizing behavior at Wave 3 were mediated by anger dysregulation at Wave 2. Our findings demonstrated the importance of distinguishing between dimensions of beliefs supporting aggression, as differential paths emerged between specific beliefs, CU traits and anger dysregulation, and externalizing outcomes. These findings have important clinical implications, as they suggest that specific dimensions of beliefs supporting aggression could be targeted based on whether an individual is at risk for behavior patterns characterizing CU traits or anger dysregulation.",

The Lifetime Assessment of Violent Acts (LAVA) inventory is a brief, reliable, face‐valid questionnaire for estimating the frequency, triggers, and consequences (including injuries to others) of prior acts of aggression. The LAVA also identifies the situational contexts in which prior violence was triggered and provides a basis for risk classifications based on past reactive, intimate partner, alcohol‐related, and/or weapon‐related violence. Scores on the LAVA indices have been linked to a range of developmental and maladjustment indicators. Associations were found between lab‐provoked (Taylor Aggression Paradigm) responding and both dimensional and risk classification scores in this sample (N = 92) of college men. Participants “competed” with a fictional opponent using electric shock as a retaliatory measure for perceived provocation. The total LAVA dimensional score predicted mean shock intensity ( d = .87), baseline responding ( d = 0.90), and past sexual aggression ( d = 1.01). Shock intensities in response to high provocation were predicted ( M d = 0.57) by all but one LAVA index. Participants who reported inflicting one or more injuries on another showed more intense escalations of aggression ( d = 0.46) in response to provocation than normative counterparts. Prior injuries to another ( RR = 2.71), reactive acts of aggression ( RR = 3.73), or intimate‐partner violence ( RR = 4.19) elevated the risk of one or more prior acts of self‐reported sexual aggression. The limitations and potential value of self‐report data were discussed in regard to aggression research.",

Participants' peers also reported on their aggressiveness. In general, added negativity of content and tone was driving the youth's intent attribution and emotional responses to the comments. In line with the Social Information Processing model, we found more hostile attribution of intent and more negative emotional responses of aggressive youth to ambiguous stimuli. Aggression was also related to more hostile intent attributions when both content and tone were negative. Unlike most studies on HAB, the aggression effects in the current study emerged for girls, but not boys. Implications of these results and future use of the experimental paradigm are discussed.",

Participants were 805 Italian adolescents (36.1% males; 63.9% females) aged 14–20 years ( M age = 17.16 years, SD age = 1.34), all reporting having been in a romantic relationship currently or within the past 6 months. Males perceiving a balanced relationship reported lower levels of psychological ADA perpetration, and they perpetrated more relational ADA in longer relationships where the partner is perceived to have the power. No significant findings emerged regarding physical ADA. Females perceiving themselves as having the power in the relationship reported higher levels of psychological and physical ADA perpetration. They perpetrated more relational ADA when they perceived the partner as having the power in the relationship. Also, females in longer relationships in which power was not perceived as equally shared between partners reported higher physical ADA perpetration. Finally, for both males and females, longer relationships were characterized by higher levels of ADA toward the partner. Findings highlight the importance of studying the interplay between power imbalance and relationship duration on ADA perpetration, and provide the way to understand possible functions of ADA within a romantic relationship.",

Aggression theory (e.g., general aggression model) posits that mitigating information may cues re-appraisal processes to potentially change aggressive behavior. If re-appraisal processes are engaged, aggressive behavior is likely to decrease. Currently, no published study has synthesized the literature to test such theoretical claims. The current study used meta-analysis to test this effect and examine the influence of several possible moderators. Results showed a significant negative effect size, suggesting that mitigating information does indeed reduce aggressive behavior after a provocation. However, these results were qualified by several significant moderators. Results showed that mitigating information reduces aggression when (a) the information did not come from an apology, (b) the non-apologetic mitigating information was high quality, and c) the provocation was mild (vs. strong).

    "abstract": "Bullying and victimization are serious problems within prisons. Young Offender Institutions (YOIs), in particular, suffer from high rates of inmate‐on‐inmate violence. More recent theories about the development of bullying in closed custody institutions imply a relationship between the experience of victimization and the usage of bullying. In our study, we test this linkage using longitudinal survey data taken at two time‐points from 473 inmates (aged 15–24) inside three YOIs in Germany. We first analyze the extent of bullying and victimization, and then used a longitudinal structural equation model to predict inmate bullying behavior at time 2 based on victimization that occurred at time 1. Age is used as a predictor variable to account for differences in the amount of victimization and bullying. Results suggest that bullying and victimization are high in the YOIs, which were subject to research. Most inmates reported being a bully and a victim at the same time. Younger inmates use more direct physical bullying but not psychological bullying. An increase in psychological bullying over time can significantly be explained by victimization at an earlier measurement time point. Our study therefore supports recent theoretical assumptions about the development of bullying behavior. Possible implications for prevention and intervention are discussed. Aggr.

Ten years later, the majority of these children (72.2%; n = 153) completed a longitudinal follow‐up battery of assessments. Included in these measures was a self‐reported measure of aggression as well as an assessment of the extent to which these adolescents disclosed to and concealed information from their parents. Separate models were estimated by gender of child for the 153 children who participated in both Time 1 and Time 2 data collections. Preschool physical aggression proved an important longitudinal predictor of adolescent disclosure and concealment for girls.

In men, what seems to be irrational decision‐making in the short‐term may be explained by other long‐term benefits; thus retaliation may not be motivated by tangible costs, but instead intangible psychological variables (e.g., status threats). In contrast, there is evidence that women are more sensitive to tangible costs than are men. In Experiment 1, using the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), we tested the prediction that in men, the frequency of provocation, and not the monetary loss (tangible cost), would be associated with retaliation, whereas women would be sensitive to the tangible costs. In keeping with the prediction, women ( n = 80) who incurred greater tangible costs (irrespective of frequency) retaliated with more costly punishment, whereas men ( n = 90) who were provoked more frequently (irrespective of tangible costs) retaliated with more costly punishment. In Experiment 2, we directly investigated whether women were more sensitive to threats to resources and men were more sensitive to threats to status, as suggested by the results of Experiment 1. Women's ( n = 53) retaliation was greater when they reported it to be a means to protect their resources, and men's ( n = 35) retaliation was greater when they reported it to be a means to protect their status. Thus, these results identify psychological variables that guide retaliation that is costly to the actor. Consistent with evolutionary perspectives, concerns about status appear to drive costly retaliatory behavior more so in men than in women. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Malamuth's (1998) confluence model holds that the combination of hostile masculinity, impersonal sexuality, and the constellation of high dominance and low nurturance plays a crucial role in explaining men's sexual aggression against women. Most studies on the confluence model concentrate on hostile masculinity and impersonal sexuality rather than dominance and nurturance. Using a person‐centered approach, we investigated whether sexual aggressive men could be better identified in a sample of 692 men when not only hostile masculinity and impersonal sexuality but also dominance and nurturance were used as indicators in a latent profile analysis. Regardless of whether dominance and nurturance were considered or not, latent profile analyses revealed a high‐risk group, which showed higher sexual aggression than other groups. In both cases, the sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of sexually aggressive men correctly assigned to the high‐risk group) was low (33% and 31%, respectively) but increased substantially for the identification of severe sexual aggression. The positive prediction value, however, increased from 68% to 78% when dominance and nurturance were considered as predictor variables in addition to hostile masculinity and impersonal sexuality, indicating that more men assigned to the high‐risk group were indeed sexually aggressive. These results demonstrate the power of the confluence model for identifying sexually aggressive men from a person‐centered perspective. They also point to the necessity of expanding this perspective by considering further (e.g., situational) risk factors, which have previously been identified as predicting sexually aggressive behavior in men.

Data were collected from 1,800 Swedish and Italian students, with an age range between 10 and 18 years ( M = 12.6, standard deviation = 1.74). The students completed a survey in their classrooms. Latent profile analysis was used to explore the possible clusters of individuals with similar ratings on the motivational variables. Multivariate analysis of variances were conducted to explore differences between the profiles in relation to their roles when witnessing bullying and to student–teacher relationships. Four latent profiles emerged. The profiles represented respondents (a) high in prosocial motivation, (b) high in externally extrinsic motivation, (c) intermediate in externally extrinsic motivation, and (d) with identified/introjected motivation. Multivariate analyses showed that reports of bystander roles when witnessing bullying, teacher–student relationships, and bullying victimization, significantly differed over the motivational profiles. The bystanders were unevenly distributed across the four groups and most individuals were categorized in the prosocial motivation group. Female and male bystanders were evenly distributed across clusters. The prosocial motivation group experienced victimization to a lesser extent than the other profile groups. Students in the intermediate externally extrinsic group were more likely to take the pro‐bully and outsider role during bullying. Concerning student–teacher relationships, the prosocial motivation group reported the closest relationships with their teachers, while the intermediate externally extrinsic group reported the most conflictual relationships.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Color polymorphism is genetically controlled, and the process generating and maintaining morphs can affect speciation/extinction rates. Color badges are useful signals in intraspecific communication because they convey information about alternative strategies and can potentially decrease unnecessary conflicts among different color morphs. Competition and aggressive interactions among color morphs can contribute to polymorphism maintenance. This could lead to an uneven spatial distribution of morphs in a population because the local frequency of each morph establishes the intensity of the competition and the fitness of each male. We used a polymorphic lizard, Podarcis muralis , to assess if aggression varies among morphs under two contrasting hypotheses: a heteromorphic versus homomorphic aggression. We used laboratory mirror tests after lizard color manipulation, and we verified the consistency of results with an analysis of the spatial distribution of morphs in a wild population. Both the experiments confirmed that aggression is more common during homomorphic than heteromorphic contests. The adoption of alternative behavioral strategies that minimize risks and costs could facilitate the stable coexistence of the phenotypes and reduce competition. A bias in aggression would advantage rarer morph, which would suffer less harassment by common morphs obtaining a fitness advantage. This process would be negatively‐frequency‐dependent and would stabilize polymorphism, possibly contributing to sympatric speciation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent reviews suggest that, like much of the psychological literature, research studies using laboratory aggression paradigms tend to be underpowered to reliably locate commonly observed effect sizes (e.g., r = ~.10–.20, Cohen's d = ~0.20–0.40). In an effort to counter this trend, we provide a “power primer” that laboratory aggression researchers can use as a resource when planning studies using this methodology. Using simulation‐based power analyses and effect size estimates derived from recent literature reviews, we provide sample size recommendations based on type of research question (e.g., main effect vs. two‐way vs. three‐way interactions) and correlations among predictors. Results highlight the large number of participants that must be recruited to reach acceptable (~80%) power, especially for tests of interactions where the recommended sample sizes far exceed those typically employed in this literature. These discrepancies are so substantial that we urge laboratory aggression researchers to consider a moratorium on tests of three‐way interactions. Although our results use estimates from the laboratory aggression literature, we believe they are generalizable to other lines of research using behavioral tasks, as well as psychological science more broadly. We close by offering a series of best practice recommendations and reiterating long‐standing calls for attention to statistical power as a basic element of study planning.",

    "abstract": "A common view is that self-harmers are individuals who are exposed to or have been exposed to stressors and hostility in everyday settings. A strand of research has also found that self-harmers expose other people to their hostility. Extending these findings, this study examined whether adolescent self-harmers are simultaneously exposed and expose others to hostility in their everyday interpersonal contexts-at home, at school, and during leisure-time. The participants were 1,482 adolescents, ranging from 13 to 16 years of age, who attended different schools in a medium-sized city in central Sweden. The results show that the adolescents involved in mutually hostile relationships in their different interpersonal contexts exhibited higher self-harm than the adolescents who were exposed to others' hostility or exposed other people to their hostility. Also, the more mutually hostile settings the adolescents were involved in, the more self-harm they reported. Overall, our findings suggest not only that self-harmers are exposed to hostility in their different interpersonal contexts, as has been typically assumed, but also that they simultaneously expose others to hostility in these contexts. This has implications for our understanding of young people who harm themselves and also for intervention. Aggr. Behav. 42:522-532, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent peer aggression is a well‐established correlate of romantic relational aggression; however, the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear. Heavy episodic drinking (or “binge” alcohol use) was examined as both a prior and concurrent mediator of this link in a sample of 282 12–18 year old interviewed four times over 6 years. Path analyses indicated that early peer relational and physical aggression each uniquely predicted later romantic relational aggression. Concurrent heavy episodic drinking fully mediated this effect for peer physical aggression only. These findings highlight two important mechanisms by which peer aggression may increase the risk of later romantic relational aggression: a direct pathway from peer relational aggression to romantic relational aggression and an indirect pathway through peer physical aggression and concurrent heavy episodic drinking. Prevention programs targeting romantic relational aggression in adolescence and young adulthood may benefit from interventions that target multiple domains of risky behavior, including the heavy concurrent use of alcohol.

    "abstract": "Lack of sleep is common in adolescence, and represents an important threat to adolescents' well-being, academic commitment, and general health. It also has significant behavioral consequences through an increased likelihood of interpersonal violence. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between aggressive behavior and lack of sleep, but the psychological mediators remain completely unexplored. Grounded in the General Aggression Model, we investigated the affective pathway as one of the potential mechanisms linking lack of sleep and aggression. We hypothesized and showed that psychological distress is an intermediary phenomenon linking lack of sleep and physical aggression. Based on a school sample of 11,912 participants (median age: 14.5), we observed that 23.7% of the young people admitted having been involved in physical fighting on one or more occasions, and that 25.81% were in sleep debt when referred for medical assessment. We analyzed the relationship between sleep duration and physical fighting and the mediating link of psychological distress by performing multiple regressions in the components' paths. The results showed that the adolescents' amount of sleep appeared to be a significant predictor of physical fighting, and that this relationship was partially mediated by psychological distress. These results are consistent with the General Aggression Model, and represent the first empirical confirmation that psychological distress symptoms partially mediate the connection between lack of sleep and physical aggression.",

Two types of social norms perceptions were examined: 1) peer norms (perceptions of norms among other students in their city), and 2) adult norms (perceptions of norms among adults in their city). Participants were 1259 middle and high school youth from a single school district (three high schools and five middle schools) who completed online surveys at two‐time points, 6 months apart. Adolescents for whom perceptions of peer norms were one standard deviation or more above and below the mean of actual norms were “over‐perceivers” and “under‐perceivers,” respectively. Overperceivers overestimated their peers' commitment to ending sexual violence, whereas underperceivers underestimated their peers' commitment to ending sexual violence. Other adolescents were “accurate perceivers”; these adolescents were accurate in their estimation of their peers' commitment to ending sexual violence. In general, underperceivers (22.2% of the sample) were more likely than accurate perceivers (77.8% of the sample) to subsequently experience peer‐to‐peer perpetration and victimization. Adolescents who perceived adults to have a higher commitment to ending sexual violence were less likely to report subsequent perpetration and victimization for some forms of peer‐to‐peer violence. These findings highlight the potential promise of the social norms approaches to prevent peer‐to‐peer violence among youth which aligns with increasing calls in the field to integrate these approaches into comprehensive sexual violence prevention.",

From an I 3 theory perspective, we expected that aloneliness could predict anger and partner‐directed aggression among persons in romantic relationships, who must, by nature of their partnership, dedicate time to their romantic partners. In Studies 1a and 1b ( N = 554), trait aloneliness positively correlated with trait anger, aggression, and violence, but more strongly among persons in relationships (vs. single persons). In Study 2, aloneliness was experimentally primed among 93 undergraduates in relationships. When aloneliness was salient (vs. a control), participants reported higher anger and used more pins in a partner‐representative voodoo doll. These results suggest that solitude is an inhibiting factor against anger and, potentially, the perpetration of partner‐directed aggression. Although subsequent work in this area is needed, we add evidence showing the importance of individual differences in the need for solitude.",

Two studies tested, experimentally, the impact of adolescents' imagined (Study 1, N = 113, M age = 16.17) and extended contact experiences (Study 2, N = 174, M age = 15.79) on assertive bystanders' behavioral intentions in the context of homophobic bullying, an under‐researched but highly detrimental behavior that emerges mainly during early adolescence. Potential mediators (empathic concern, social contagion concerns, and masculinity/femininity threat) were also examined. Results showed that female younger participants revealed more behavioral intentions to help victims of homophobic bullying when asked to imagine an interaction with an outgroup member (Study 1). Younger participants revealed less masculinity/femininity threat in the positive extended contact condition, and female participants revealed less empathic concern in the negative extended contact condition (Study 2). Overall, these findings identify specific conditions (e.g., younger females) where indirect contact interventions (i.e., extended and imagined) are likely to have a stronger impact. Age and sex differences were found to illustrate how adolescents vary in their behavioral intentions, empathic concern, and threat; and also highlight the need to further examine age and sex differences regarding responses to homophobic bullying episodes.",

The study spanned three‐time points (T1 in the spring, T2 in the fall, and T3 in the spring) in early childhood ( N = 300; 44.0% girls; M age = 44.70 months, SD = 4.38; 3.0% African American/Black, 7.6% Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander, 1.0% Hispanic/Latinx, 11.3% multiracial, 62.1% White, and 15.0% missing/unknown). Observations of peer victimization and teacher report of peer rejection were collected at T1, and teacher report of aggression was collected at all time points. Results from piecewise latent growth models demonstrated that both forms of aggression decreased from T1 to T2 as children entered a new classroom and increased from T2 to T3 as they remained in that classroom. The increase in physical aggression from T2 to T3 was only significant for boys. Peer rejection at T1 emerged as a predictor of both intercepts and slopes from T1 to T2, and physical victimization predicted the physical aggression intercept and physical aggression slope from T1 to T2. Children high on these peer risk variables had higher initial levels of aggression, followed by a greater decrease in aggression from T1 to T2. Results underscore the importance of studying incremental change in aggression in early childhood and suggest that children who experience negative peer treatment have greater fluctuations in aggression over time.",

Studies recently demonstrated a relationship between dispositional mindfulness and bullying as well. However, in the last 2 decades, research has broadened this perspective, suggesting that active and passive bystanders may play a major role in school bullying by either supporting or opposing bullying. In this research, we examined whether empathy, MD, self-regulation, and mindfulness are significantly associated with probullying, defending, and bystanding behaviors. A total of 429 middle and high school adolescents from Israel (mean age = 16.81 years, SD = 1.62) completed online questionnaires. Through structural equation modeling, we found that empathy was associated with both, self-regulation and defending behaviors. MD was associated with defending and probullying behaviors. Dispositional mindfulness was associated with all three roles we examined. All these relationships were significant and in the expected direction. As mindfulness is a disposition that can be cultivated, this finding may have further implications in programs that aim at reducing school bullying.",

    "abstract": "Studies suggest both alexithymia and impulsivity (partially) explain aggressive behavior in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, but none of these studies use both questionnaire and performance-based measures as recommended, nor simultaneously investigate both impulsivity and alexithymia. The available studies therefore likely miss part of the constructs of alexithymia and impulsivity, and do not comprehensively assess the mediating effects of both constructs in the relationship between TBI and aggression. A sample of N = 281 incarcerated individuals were recruited from Dutch penitentiary institutions, and completed the Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire (aggression), BIS-11 (impulsivity) and Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (alexithymia) questionnaires, as well as a stop-signal task and an emotion recognition paradigm. Several multiple mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling, to assess the viability of a causal theoretical model of aggression. The final planned models were the original models with a good fit with the data (comparative fit index > 0.95, root mean square error of approximation and Standardized root mean square residual < 0.05), and results indicate that only questionnaire-based impulsivity mediated the relationship between TBI and aggression. TBI was unrelated to alexithymia, stop-signal or emotion recognition performance. Aggression was predicted by both alexithymia and impulsivity, but not by the performance measures. Post hoc analyses shows that alexithymia moderates the relationship between impulsivity and aggression. These results imply that aggressive incarcerated individuals showing impulsive behavior should be screened for TBI, since TBI is often overlooked or misdiagnosed, and indicate that both impulsivity and alexithymia are potential focus points for aggression reduction treatment in TBI patients.",

However, previous research has generally not tested this mediational pathway, particularly in the context of persistent ethnic-political violence exposure. The present study examined associations among violence exposure, CU traits, and aggression in a sample of 1051 youth in the Middle East (Palestine and Israel), using youth- and parent-reported data in a cohort-sequential design with three age cohorts (starting ages 8, 11, and 14 years) assessed over four waves spanning 6 years. Results from structural equation models with latent variables indicated that cumulative violence exposure in childhood and adolescence (measured annually for 3 years, and comprising exposure across multiple settings including political, community, family, and school) predicted later CU traits and aggression in adolescence and early adulthood, even after controlling for earlier levels of aggression and CU traits and demographic characteristics (child age and sex and parental socioeconomic status). Additionally, in mediation analyses, CU significantly mediated the association from earlier cumulative violence exposure to concurrent aggression, while aggression did not significantly mediate the association from earlier exposure to concurrent CU traits. The results of this study suggest that violence exposure leads to both aggressive behavior and a constellation of traits that place youth at greater risk for subsequent aggressive behavior, and that CU traits could partially explain the increased risk of aggression after violence exposure.",

The aim was to examine violence‐related clusters and their association of these clusters with mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and depression). We assessed whether participants experienced physical, sexual, and psychological violence in their intimate relationships and conducted a latent class analysis. We obtained five violence clusters: (1) no or low violence, (2) high psychological violence, (3) jealous control with physical violence, (4) moderate sexual and psychological violence, and (5) severe physical, sexual, and psychological violence. Analyses of variance showed that women who experienced multiple forms of IPV reported stronger depression, anxiety, and somatization compared with women in the no or low violence class. Additionally, they reported greater depression and anxiety compared with women who experienced only high psychological IPV. However, psychological violence amplified somatization as much as physical and sexual violence.",

Here we formulate an obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD) model of radicalization that links obsessive passion (OP; one of the best predictors of radical intentions) to a larger body of clinical research. The model's central tenet is that individual differences in OCD symptom severity could shape radical intentions via their influence on OP. Across four ideological samples in the United States (Environmental activists, Republicans, Democrats, and Muslims, N total = 1114), we found direct effects between OCD symptom severity and radical intentions, as well as indirect effects of OCD on radical intentions via OP. Even after controlling for potential individual difference and clinical confounds (e.g., adverse childhood experiences, loss of significance, and substance abuse), these relationships remained robust, implying that OCD plays a significant role in the formation of violent ideological intentions and opening new avenues for the treatment and prevention of violent extremism. We discuss the implications of conceptualizing radicalization as an OCD‐like disorder with compulsive violent tendencies and ideology‐related concerns.",

In this first survey on animal abuse carried out in higher education in France and based on a highly powered sample ( N = 55,040 participants), we investigated the relative weight of risk factors pertaining to major criminological dimensions in a multivariate model controlling for relevant demographics: General Strain Theory (GST), Social Bond Theory (SBT), and Generalized Deviance Theory (GDT), as well as three key psychological dimensions: Callousness, Sensation seeking, and Impulse control difficulties. We observed that 6.4% of the participants declared having perpetrated animal abuse in the past, with males having done so about three times more often than females. Animal abuse was linked with callousness, difficulties in impulse control and sensation seeking. Participants who reported a climate of violence in their family, or who had witnessed acts of violence by their father against their mother, were particularly prone to abuse animals, which supported GST predictions. To a lesser extent, in line with SBT, animal abuse was higher among students with lower attachment to their mother, and who had a weaker belief in justice. Finally, animal abuse was perpetrated significantly more often by participants reporting higher alcohol consumption, as predicted by GDT. In summary, animal harm is related to a combination of risk factors pertaining to major criminological and psychological perspectives on aggression and violence, knowledge of which is useful in prioritizing future research directions and prevention strategies.",

Psychological methods to prevent and reduce anger and aggression have been partially successful; however, there is room for novel interventions, such as those informed by neuroscience. One such intervention is anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which involves administering a weak electrical current to the brain to stimulate cortical activity. In this meta‐analysis, we synthesized 93 effect sizes from 25 sham‐controlled experiments. We predicted that tDCS would reduce anger and aggression. The overall results showed no effect of tDCS on anger and aggression (Hedges' g = −0.03, CI 95% = −0.30, 0.24). Separate meta‐analyses of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex showed no effects of tDCS. The meta‐analysis was limited by low power in the source articles (average power = 0.33); No study reached the sufficient sample size to detect a medium effect. Thus, there is room for more well‐powered research on the topic to determine whether tDCS may reduce aggression.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to examine early adolescent trajectories of bullying/peer‐aggression in terms of their prevalence, composition, and ability to correlate with concurrent delinquency. Three hypotheses were tested in a group of 1145 middle school students (49.6% male; mean age = 11.23 years) using longitudinal data spread out over three waves. The first hypothesis predicted that bullying/peer‐aggression victimization would be significantly more prevalent and frequent than bullying/peer‐aggression perpetration. The second hypothesis held that a semiparametric sequential process growth mixture modeling (GMM) analysis for two latent variables would identify pure victim and mixed victim–perpetrator trajectories but no pure perpetrator trajectories. The third hypothesis asserted that the trajectory models identified in the GMM analysis would differentially correlate with a change in delinquency, such that accelerating trajectories would be associated with a rise in delinquency and decelerating trajectories with a drop in delinquency. Analyses provided support for all three hypotheses: victimization was significantly more prevalent and frequent than perpetration; there were no pure perpetration trajectories, even after increasing the number of trajectories from 6 to 9; and accelerating trajectories were associated with a significant rise in delinquency from Wave 1 to Wave 3 and decelerating trajectories with a marginally significant decrease in delinquency from Wave 1 to Wave 3. These results highlight the value of studying change in the perpetration and victimization of peer‐aggression as a way of understanding how bullying/peer aggression in early adolescence develops and contributes to the formation of other problems, such as delinquency.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT While numerous meta‐analyses, reviews, and task forces from various scientific bodies have linked violent media use to aggression, some studies report null effects and claim that such a relationship is non‐existent. Several scholars have noted that potential methodological and statistical errors could explain failures to replicate these effects. One recent failure to replicate established violent video game effects (Przybylski and Weinstein 2019) has made its data set publicly available, thereby offering a unique opportunity to examine the hypothesis that methodological and statistical problems underlie some replication failures. The present study re‐examined the original results from Przybylski and Weinstein (2019) using more appropriate analyses and replicated those results with recalculated, corrected, and more theoretically appropriate variables. The first part examines issues within the original study, including problems with the measure used to assess aggression, statistical control, and the measurement of exposure to video game violence (VGV). The second part created a more standard measure of VGV exposure to test whether the null result stemmed from this measurement issue. Overall, results demonstrate that conceptual misunderstandings of aggression, poor measures regarding both aggression and video game violence exposure, and inappropriate statistical procedures contributed to the initially reported null results. Furthermore, by using improved materials (including a more sophisticated coding scheme to assess exposure to violent video games) and sound statistical analysis (correcting for overcontrol), the data replicate the long‐established relationship between playing violent video games and aggressive behavior.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Suicidality and physical aggression are leading, related youth public health concerns. Yet, whether adolescents who harm themselves, others, or both differ emotionally and etiologically remains unclear. To address this, adolescents from a prospective population‐based birth cohort reported their suicidality, physical aggression, depression/anxiety symptoms, anger, and callousness ( N = 1637). Distinct latent harm‐emotion profiles were identified, which were linked to perinatal and childhood experiences. A six‐profile solution was retained: Low harm (79.5%), moderate suicidality (6.5%), high suicidality (2%), high aggression (2.5%), moderate aggression (8.5%), and high suicidality and aggression (dual harm; 1%). Elevated harm profiles were compared to the low‐harm group. Moderate/high suicidality profiles showed slight elevations in physical aggression. All elevated harm profiles expressed higher negative emotionality. Dual harm and aggression groups reported higher callousness, while suicidality groups reported lower callousness. Aggression profiles were 75% male, suicidality profiles were 21% male, while the low and dual‐harm profiles were more similarly mixed sex (47% vs. 63% male, respectively). Low‐harm youth experienced more positive childhood parenting. The dual harm and high aggression groups had more deviant childhood best friends, while the dual harm and moderate aggression groups had lower early life household income. The moderate suicidality group had fathers with higher depressive symptoms during infancy and childhood. Thus, one in five youth showed relatively elevated suicidality and/or physical aggression; of which, 95% tended to have a primary target (themselves or others). Early life economic, parental, and peer support may be key for preventing suicidal and aggressive outcomes in adolescence.",

Additionally, the risk for IPV is particularly high among discordant as compared to concordant heavy drinking couples. Despite the fact that individuals who drink heavily often also use other drugs, the extent to which couples' use of other drugs interacts with heavy drinking patterns remains unknown. The current study examined differences in psychological and physical IPV perpetration as a function of couples' heavy drinking and other drug use patterns. The sample included 337 couples in which at least one partner reported a history of heavy drinking and IPV in the current relationship. Results of dyadic path models showed that concordant drug using couples who engaged in either discordant or concordant heavy drinking were at greater risk for male‐ and female‐perpetrated psychological IPV compared to concordant nondrug using couples (regardless of heavy drinking) and concordant nonheavy drinking couples (regardless of drug use). Associations between heavy drinking and other drug use patterns on physical IPV perpetration were not statistically significant. These findings show that a pattern of concordant drug use paired with discordant or concordant heavy drinking places couples at particularly high risk for psychological IPV. Clinicians working with couples affected by IPV may benefit from paying attention to the dyadic dynamics of heavy drinking, other drug use, and IPV.",

Yet, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the risk factors for adults to ruminate on their past victimization experiences. The current study fills this gap by examining whether current social relationships (e.g., workplace victimization, loneliness, romantic relationship satisfaction) of young adults play a role in rumination (as an adult) on past victimization. This preregistered study uses longitudinal data from 1772 Finnish individuals ( M age = 26.04, SD = 1.57), who were part of a large longitudinal project when they were in Grades 4–9, with a follow‐up study conducted over a decade later. Workplace victimization and loneliness in adulthood emerged as key predictors of rumination in adulthood about past victimization. The findings suggest that current adult social relationships are a risk factor for previously victimized individuals to dwell on their victimization as adults, regardless of the extent to which they were victimized in adolescence.",

Contrary to narratives that focus exclusively on religious extremism, the findings indicate that terrorism justification is more strongly associated with a worldview characterized by moral flexibility, antisocial values, and anti‐democratic sentiment. An analysis of the top predictors revealed three overarching domains: (1) Normalization of Violence, where support for terrorism is closely linked to broader acceptance of aggression in political, interpersonal, and domestic contexts; (2) Moral Flexibility and Rule Violation, where individuals who justify terrorism also endorse dishonest behaviors such as bribery, theft, and fraud; and (3) Religious and Political Authoritarianism, characterized by support for governance based on religious authority and skepticism toward democratic institutions. These findings underscore the need for counter‐radicalization strategies that address moral disengagement, promote democratic values, and strengthen trust in democratic governance.",

    "abstract": "Maternal aggression was studied in Oreochromis mossambicus during the mouthbrooding cycle. Brooding females were observed in heterosexual captive groups, and their agonistic interactions and behavioural activities were registered. Brooding females were classified into three classes according to the developmental stage of the brood they were incubating: phase 1, brooding eggs; phase 2, brooding fry with yolk-sac; phase 3, brooding fry with exogeneous feeding. The behaviour of the brooding females was compared with the behaviour of control non-incubating females. During the brooding cycle females become increasingly more aggressive toward other individuals, with their aggressiveness reaching a peak in phase 3. During the brooding cycle the females also suppress their feeding activities. The outcome of the agonistic interactions (victories–defeats) of the brooding females was positively correlated with the brooding phase but not with clutch size. The main function of maternal aggression in O. mossambicus seems to be the defence of the vulnerable brood against predators, including conspecifics, at a developmental stage when the fry start to forage outside the mother's mouth.

The results of the present study indicate that a substantial proportion of college-aged males report a history of aggressive behavior, both in dating/spousal relationship and other-relationship types. Analyses revealed that observing parental aggression and receiving aggression from parents was related to aggression in dating relationships. However, only received aggression from parents was related to more general aggressiveness in other non–dating/spousal relationship types.

Similarly to male-male agonistic interactions, females were attacked in a fashion which avoided bites to the head and snout (“offensive” attack), whereas males were frequently bitten on such vulnerable regions (“defensive” attack). This dichotomy in bite pattern suggests that different motivations and functions underlay maternal aggression in these situations. The defensive attack on males may be a deterrent to infanticide since only male intruders counterattack lactating females and kill their pups.

    "abstract": "This review outlines recent research on a subset of physiological responses in murine “victims” or aggression. In a typical resident-intruder paradigm, the detailed study of intruders has revealed that exposure to conspecific attack (and related stimuli) is associated with two forms of analgesia which appear to be integral components of the murine defensive repertoire. In response to intense/enduring attack, intruder mice display a profound, long-lasting and opioid-mediated analgesia. This reaction is highly correlated with defensive immobility and may function to reduce involuntary cues to further attack. In contrast, the inhibition of pain reactivity in mice tested immediately upon the display of defeat is less intense, shorter-lasting, non-opioid in nature and may function to facilitate active defenses such as escape. As this form of pain inhibition is also evident in intruders exposed to the scent of an aggressive male conspecific, a possible anticipatory defensive function linked to mechanisms of anxiety has been proposed. This hypothesis is supported by 1) the prevention of defeat analgesia by a range of antianxiety drugs (benzodiazepines, 5-hydroxytryptamine1A [5-HT1A] receptor agonists, and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists) and 2) the effects of social defeat on behavior in the elevated plusmaze model of anxiety. These findings are discussed in relation to coping mechanisms in murine “victims” of aggression. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

C57/BL/6N Sin strain mice showed fewer avoidances to an approaching predator, as well as reduced vocalization and defensive biting, a pattern more similar to that of laboratory rats. As with rats, female mice appeared to be more defensive to a predator.

    "abstract": "Abstract Play fighting in many species of squirrels can involve sexual play and aggressive play, both of which can lead to wrestling which appears superficially similar. Such convergence can make scoring of the relative frequencies of these two types of play difficult and can lead to the mistaken conclusion that they grade into one another. In this study, both staged laboratory encounters between sibling pairs and spontaneous encounters between siblings in free‐living litters of Richardson’s ground squirrels ( Spermophilus richardsonii ) were videotaped. Frame‐by‐frame analyses using the Eshkol‐Wachman Movement Notation were employed to record the correlated movements of attack and defense by the partners and to reveal the body areas targeted during each play bout. Whereas sexual play was organized around access to the rump, aggressive play was organized around the shoulders. Although in most cases the defender’s tactics blocked access to the respective target, when contact did occur, it involved mounting in sexual play and nosing or biting in aggressive play. Eighty‐six percent of play fights could be unambiguously categorized as either sexual or aggressive play. Of these, the majority (˜80%) involved sexual play. The sex of the participants did not affect the frequency of aggressive play, but in sexual play, males initiated more attacks than females. Once initiated, each form of play fighting remained distinct—if a bout began as sexual play, it would end as sexual play. Furthermore, a counterattack following sexual play was significantly more likely to be sexual than aggressive, and vice versa for counterattacks following aggressive play. Therefore, all the evidence suggested that the two forms of play fighting were not intermixed in Richardson’s ground squirrels. Aggr. Behav. 27:323–337, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed whether two types of non-aggressive “standard opponents” (“intact” and “anosmic” group-housed males) produced similar behavioral changes in isolated OF1 male mice given several experiences of victory. Experimental groups confronted either intact or anosmic opponents every two days until they had completed four encounters. The behavioral changes were recorded using a detailed ethologically inspired analysis. These changes were clearly different depending on the opponent type. When intact opponents were used, experimental subjects increased the time spent in digging, non-social exploration, explore from a distance, and attack over encounters, but showed decreased time spent in threat and a decreased latency to the first attack. In encounters with anosmic opponents, only declines in the latencies to threat and attack were noted. Moreover, the experimental groups differed in their behaviors over encounters. Those confronting intact opponents spent less time in social investigation, more time in explore from a distance and threat, and showed a shorter latencies to threat and attack than counterparts confronting anosmics. These results suggest that, although both types of “standard opponents” are similar in their non-aggressiveness, they elicit rather different behavioral responses in their adversaries. These findings provide additional support for the view that the type of opponent used in studies on intermale aggression is of paramount importance. Indeed, the use of different types of “standardized non-aggressive opponents” appears to be an important source of variability between studies. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The role of gonadal androgens in favoring the adaptation to environmental pressure, including social organization, is well known. In the rabbit, testosterone administration increases marking behavior, and its level can be affected by agonistic interaction. In this experiment, we studied the effect of subcutaneous administration of testosterone propionate (TP) (3 mg/d for 6 days) in male rabbits belonging to the same social group (6 groups of 4 animals). In 2 additional groups (4 animals each), males were injected with almond oil. The animals were observed for 6 days in seminatural conditions, then treated with TP (or oil) and observed for another 6 days. The dominant/subordinate frequency ratio of behavioral patterns was used to rank the animals. The testosterone plasma concentration was correlated with agonistic behavior after the first period of social interaction. A significant increase of marking, digging, and defensive activity was observed after TP administration in all animals independent of rank, whereas this increase was not present in animals treated with oil. Agonistic and interactive behaviors increased significantly after TP treatment only in the first‐ranking animals.

    "abstract": "Reactions to harassment of victims of bullying were studied. One issue was, what kind of behavior on the part of the victim is likely to a) make the others start or continue bullying or b) diminish bullying or put an end to it. Altogether 573 pupils (286 girls, 287 boys) from 11 Finnish schools served as subjects: 67 of them (33 girls, 34 boys) were identified as victims of bullying. Both peer- and self-evaluations were used as methods of the study. Three subscales, describing counteraggressive, helpless, and nonchalant behavioral responses to bullying were established on the basis of peer-evaluations of the victims' behavior. Three different subtypes of victims (the Counteraggressive, the Helpless, and the Nonchalant) were identified. Helplessness and nonchalance were found to be typical responses of the girl victims, while boy victims tended to react to bullying with counteraggression or nonchalance. The victims' self-evaluations of their behavior supported these views. Helplessness and counteraggression in the case of girl victims and counteraggression in the case of boy victims were perceived as making the bullying start or continue. The absence of helplessness in the case of girl victims, and nonchalance as well as the absence of counteraggression in the case of boy victims were perceived as making the bullying diminish or stop. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Younger, reproductive-age women are battered and killed by husbands at higher rates than are older, postreproductive-age women. Because husband killing occurs in the context of self-defense or as a last-ditch effort to survive, reproductive-age women should kill their husbands at higher rates than do postreproductive-age women. I used a sample of 8,077 husband killings to test this hypothesis. Results support the hypothesis and document that (1) the highest rates of husband killing are for the youngest women, (2) the youngest husbands are at greatest risk of being killed by their wives, (3) women married to older men kill their husbands at higher rates than do women married to same-age men and women married to younger men, and (4) reproductive-age women kill their husbands at higher rates than do postreproductive-age women across two groups: women married to younger men and women married to older men.

The first administration as a reward-only, nonpunishment condition. The second administration contained both reward and punishment conditions. Results indicated clear differences on aggressive responding during conditions of reward and punishment. Significant correlations were found between instrumental aggression during reward across the two administrations, whereas correlations between aggression during reward and aggression during punishment were nonsignificant. Teacher ratings of Covert-Proactive Aggression correlated with analogue task instrumental aggression but not with hostile aggression on both administrations. Aggression during punishment was significantly correlated with Continuous Performance Test inattention and impulsivity scores, suggesting that impulsivity and inattention may play an important role in children’s ability to inhibit aggression during cues for punishment.

Before and after the film, data were collected about their opinion on violence. Three viewing conditions were established according to the degree and type of violence shown and based on Berkowitz [(1996): Desclée De Brouwer]: action without violence, socially justified violence, and socially unjustified violence. Several ANOVAs were carried out revealing that violence is better valued and more attractive after watching the film sequences than before the showing. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Thstosterone has a modulatory role in the control of aggressive behavior in male mice. To determine where within the forebrain testosterone might be exerting this modulation, we implanted testosterone into discrete brain regions in castrated male mice and then assessed their level of aggression. Male mice were castrated, and 3 weeks later a 23-gauge guide cannula was implanted into the medial preoptic area (MPOA), septum, or caudate nucleus. Twice per week, they received approximately 3 μg of testosterone or cholesterol through 30-gauge cannulae. The day after hormone or control treatment, the mice were tested for aggressive behavior by confronting them with an intruder. Septal implants of testosterone were effective in restoring male aggressive behavior. The frequency of attacks in the groups receiving testosterone in the MPOA or caudate did not differ from that of the cholesterol-treated controls. Testosterone implanted into any of these three sites did not alter nonaggressive behaviors. The septum appears to be an important site for testosterone mediation of aggressive behavior in mice. This result is consistent with earlier work with male mice; however, unlike the present experiment, earlier research in rats has alsofound the MPOA to be a site sensitive to the aggression promoting actions of testosterone. This may represent a species difference in hormonal control or reflect differences in methodology.",

Results showed that the frequency of agonistic interactions was little affected by spatial density; however, the number of participants involved in aggressive interactions increased in the cage.

    "abstract": "Abstract Threat displays are used to settle the vast majority of contests between green anoles ( Anolis carolinensis ). While these displays have been the subject of a number of studies, very little is understood about the information they convey. Theoretical models divide displays into several types of signals, based on the mechanism that stabilizes their use: 1) performance signals, 2) handicapping signals, or 3) conventional displays. The existence of performance displays has excellent empirical support, as do models of their use. Handicapped signalling models, especially those relating to mate‐choice, have been highly influential, though little evidence suggests that threat displays are, in fact, handicapping. Most threat displays appear to be conventional, but little empirical work documents conventional signalling systems. This study investigated the use of headbob, pushup, and lateral compression displays, and concluded that headbob cadence, a discrete signal with three alternative rhythms, is a conventional display indicating impending escalation. Pushups and lateral compression displays appear not to be handicaps, since neither indicates impending escalation, and they do not correlate with fighting ability or condition. Aggr.

The sample was selected from the Personality Disorder Unit of a high secure hospital. The total sample consisted of 60 participants, 30 patients and 30 staff. Participants engaged in a semi‐structured interview based on that developed by Brookes [1993] and modified by Ireland and Archer [1996] and Ireland [2002a]. The interview assessed their perceptions and experiences of patient‐to‐patient bullying. One fifth of patients and staff reported that they had seen a patient being bullied in the previous week. One‐fifth of patients reported that they had been bullied in the previous week and less than one tenth reported that they had bullied others. The most frequent types of bullying reported were theft‐related, verbal abuse, being made to do chores, physical assaults and intimidation. One fifth of the sample reported that sexual abuse took place. Victims were generally perceived to be ‘easy targets’ that were vulnerable, either physically or emotionally. Staff identified a wider range of victim types than patients. The results highlight how patient‐to‐patient bullying does occur and is an important issue worthy of further research. A number of similarities were found between the current findings and those of prison‐based research suggesting that both hospitals and prisons share a number of environmental similarities that help to explain why bullying takes placed in secure forensic settings.

It was found that gender and years of cohabitating were significantly related to Emotional aggression and Sexual violence ; lifestyle patterns were associated with specific forms of violence. More specifically, the lifestyles of Pleasure &amp; Elegance and the one of Culture–Intellectualism were found to promote Emotional aggression. Also, the lifestyle of Yuppies/Workaholic and that of Physical activities stimulated the appearance of Sexual violence between partners. Moreover, individuals with Tradition–Religiousness lifestyle were more likely to show lower levels of Physical &amp; Sexual violence while the adherents of the Substance abuse lifestyle pattern appeared to have an inclination towards Physical &amp; Sexual Violence .

Homicide Studies 5: 253‐266, 2001] calculated rates of partner‐killing by women by relationship type (cohabiting or marital), by partner ages, and by the age difference between partners. Men in cohabiting relationships were 10 times more likely to be killed by their partners than were married men. Within marriages, the risk of being killed by a partner decreased with a man's age. Within cohabiting relationships, in contrast, middle‐aged men were at greatest risk of being killed by their partners. The risk that a man will be killed by his partner generally increased with greater age difference between partners. We sought to replicate the findings of Shackelford [2001] using national‐level data held as part of the National Homicide Monitoring Program (NHMP) at the Australian Institute of Criminology in Australia. The NHMP holds data on over 3,500 homicides that occurred in Australia between 1989 and 2000. Despite the higher rate of partner‐killing in the United States, and despite other cultural differences between the two countries (for example, the prominent gun culture in the United States), we replicated the key patterns with the Australian data.

Immediately after this, each person had to administer other noise blasts to someone else in a different manner, but with the previous noise machines (the fist \"weapon\") being either present or not present.

Other evidence indicates (1) that the aggressive cue, the \"weapon,\" had not affected the subjects' aggressive intentions, (2) the results are not due simply to differences in moods or general arousal, and (3) the subjects were not aware of the hypothesis regarding the interaction of reinforcement and cue presence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A quantitative analysis of broadcasted violence by the main television (TV) channels transmitting for Madrid (Spain) was carried out using a novel method that randomly selects fragments of delimited duration from TV broadcasts. The device selects acts of aggression shown in those TV extracts, and classifies them according to their type. There was a high incidence of aggressive acts, especially physical (particularly leading to death), in TV fiction: films, serials and promos. The device also allowed examination of the prominence of aggression in children's programs, as well as showing minimal variation in the number of aggressive acts over screened time intervals. The pattern of the collected data suggests that the broadcasting of violence on TV emphasizes the conflicting elements of social reality, reproducing it in fiction, news reports and children's shows.

As a result, a great deal of confusion and controversy has arisen as to the causal factors and functions of aggression. The main ethological hypotheses concerning the nature of aggression are put forward. In order to illustrate the divergence in causal factors and functions, differences in motivational, physiological, and ecological bases of aggression in two closely related fish species are described. A basic division of aggression into “self-defensive” and “property-protective” behavior is suggested, together with the parameters separating these categories on behavioral, causal, and functional bases. Mechanisms which enable motivational changes from one category to another to take place during a single encounter are discussed, these being pain stimuli and physical or psychological “cornering.” The importance of learning effects on fighting behavior are emphasized, especially their negative and positive reinforcing effects in relation to self and property defense. The biological significance of aggressive conditioning for the animal and the role of aggression in species maintenance are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Brief, gentle arm restraint is widely used in experimental studies of children's anger, but the pattern of responses generated by such restraint has been incompletely described. We now describe a hierarchy of responses within trials as well as an escalation across trials that have both methodological and theoretical significance. Mothers of 87 15‐month olds prevented them from playing with a toy by restraining their arms on two consecutive 30 sec trials. Physical struggling was the first and most frequent response; children who struggled were significantly more likely to vocalize, and those who vocalized were significantly more likely to show facial expressions of anger. The children's responses became more probable, rapid, and intense during Trial 2 restraint. Overall, the hierarchy was orderly enough to meet criteria for Guttman scalability. The particular sequence observed suggests situational, as opposed to bio‐energetic, ordering of responses. Methodologically, the two trial paradigm is a simple, ecologically valid model for studying anger escalation that parallels the “attack priming” of aggression in other species. The magnitude and persistence of anger priming may provide novel measures of anger regulation. Theoretically, the existence of an orderly response hierarchy is consistent with previous observations suggesting that, within a situational context, the sequential appearance of specific behaviors may indicate progressive increases in anger intensity.

Moreover, it utilized both primary caregiver and youth self‐reports of psychopathology across four developmental stages of childhood and adolescence. When examined separately, the results indicated affective/depressive, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity, and oppositional defiant/antisocial personality problems independently predicted violence. When considering comorbidity, however, only oppositional defiant and antisocial personality problems significantly predicted violence at any stage, regardless of informant type.

Aggressive behavior was also more likely to occur when teams played divisional (compared to league and inter‐league) rivals, however this relationship was contingent on season progression. We provide potential boundary conditions relating to the heat‐aggression relationship, indicating this may not be a ubiquitous phenomenon.",

Almost 2000 undergraduate men judged the justifiability of a man's increasingly unwanted advances toward a woman on the Heterosocial Perception Survey‐Revised. Participants self‐reported any sexual‐aggression history, and some completed questionnaires assessing rape‐supportive attitudes, sociosexuality, problem drinking, and self‐reported MSI. A three‐parameter logistic function was fitted to participants’ justifiability ratings within a non‐linear mixed‐effects framework, which provided precise participant‐specific estimates of three sexual‐perception processes (baseline justifiability, bias, and sensitivity). Sexual‐aggression history and rape‐supportive attitudes predicted: (a) reduced sensitivity to women's affect; (b) more liberal biases, such that the woman's affect had to be more negative before justifiability ratings dropped substantially; and (c) greater baseline justifiability of continued advances after a positive response. Sexual‐aggression history and attitudes correlated more strongly with sensitivity than baseline justifiability; remaining variables showed the opposite pattern. This work underscores the role of sexual‐perception processes in sexual aggression and illustrates the derivation of performance‐based estimates of sexual‐perception processes from questionnaire responses.",

Given that animals are voiceless victims , we have to rely on witnesses and frontline staff (e.g., veterinarians) to report incidents of abuse, which suggests the number of convicted animal abusers is an under‐representation of actual perpetrators. The primary aim of the current study was to identify the static and dynamic factors that distinguish animal abusers from non‐abuse offenders (i.e., individuals who self‐reported antisocial behavior, but not animal abuse), and non‐offenders (i.e., individuals who have not engaged in any antisocial behavior) in a community sample. The secondary aim was to identify the potential pathways that distinguish animal abuse perpetration from other types of antisocial behavior. Three hundred and eighty‐four participants took part in this retrospective, correlational study. We found that animal abusers share similar socio‐demographic characteristics to other offenders but are distinct in their exposure to animal harm/killing during childhood. Low animal‐oriented empathy and low self‐esteem distinguished animal abusers from non‐abuse offenders when controlling for confound variables and other psychological characteristics. We also found that low animal‐oriented empathy mediated the relationship between childhood exposure to animal killing and animal abuse perpetration, and that this relationship was stronger among participants with anger regulation issues. This is the first study to examine similarities and differences between animal abusers, non‐abuse offenders, and non‐offenders on socio‐demographic and psychological characteristics. The findings highlight potential treatment targets that are unique to animal abusers with implications for prevention and intervention strategies.",

IED was defined by the occurrence of at least three anger attacks that were disproportionate to the provocation within a single year. Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement (N = 6,140), and diagnoses were based on structured lay-administered interviews. Over half (51.89%) of adolescents with IED had an AD, compared to only 22.88% of adolescents without IED. Compared to adolescents with IED alone, adolescents with IED and comorbid ADs: (a) were more likely to be female; (b) reported greater impairment in work/school, social, and overall functioning; (c) were more likely to receive an additional psychiatric diagnosis, a depressive or drug abuse diagnosis, or diagnoses of three or more additional disorders; and (d) had higher odds of receiving any mental/behavioral health treatment as well as treatment specifically focused on aggression. Adolescents with IED alone and those with comorbid ADs did not differ in the number of years experiencing anger attacks or the highest number of anger attacks in a given year. ADs frequently co-occur with IED and are associated with elevated comorbidity and greater impairment compared to IED alone. Gaining a better understanding of this comorbidity is essential for developing specialized and effective methods to screen and treat comorbid anxiety in adolescents with aggressive behavior problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aggression is often measured in the laboratory as an iterative “tit‐for‐tat” sequence, in which two aggressors repeatedly inflict retaliatory harm upon each other. Aggression researchers typically quantify aggression by aggregating across participants’ aggressive behavior on such iterative encounters. However, this “aggregate approach” cannot capture trajectories of aggression across the iterative encounters and needlessly eliminates rich information in the form of within‐participant variability. As an alternative approach, I used multilevel modeling (MLM) to examine the slope of aggression across the 25‐trial Taylor Aggression Paradigm as a function of trait physical aggression and experimental provocation. Across two preregistered studies (combined N = 392), participants exhibited a modest decline in aggression. This decline reflected a reciprocal strategy, in which participants responded to an initially‐provocative opponent with greater aggression that then decreased over time to match their opponent's declining levels of aggression. Against predictions, trait physical aggression and experimental provocation did not affect participants’ overall trajectories of aggression. Yet, exploratory analyses suggested that the participants’ tendency to reciprocate their opponent's aggression with more aggression was greater at higher levels of trait physical aggression and attenuated among participants who had already been experimentally provoked by their opponent. These findings (a) illustrate several advantages of an MLM approach as compared with an aggregate approach to iterative laboratory aggression paradigms; (b) demonstrate that the magnifying effects of trait aggression and experimental provocation on laboratory aggression are stable over brief time‐frames; and (c) suggest that modeling the opponent's behavior on such tasks reveals important information.",

Study 2 addressed bullies', victims', bully/victims', and non-involved children's attribution of human characteristics to each other.

Unique associations with most individual difference variables dissipated once we controlled for social aggression and rule‐breaking, although DA was independently associated with extraversion and alcohol use problems.

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the mechanisms behind aggressive behavior (AGG) is vital so that effective prevention and intervention strategies can be developed. Maltreated children are hypothesized to be prone to social information processing biases, such as hostile attribution bias (HAB), which, in turn, may increase the likelihood of behaving aggressively. The first aim of the present study was to replicate findings regarding associations between childhood maltreatment (CM), HAB, and aggression in a population‐based sample of Finnish female twins and their sisters ( N = 2,167). However, these associations might not be causal but instead confounded by familial factors, shared between the variables. The second aim was, thus, to test the associations when potential confounding by familial (genetic or common environmental) effects were controlled for using a multilevel discordant twin and sibling design within (a) 379 pairs of twins ( n pairs = 239) or siblings ( n pairs = 140), and (b) within the 131 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. Consistent with previous studies, HAB mediated the association between CM and AGG when familial confounding was uncontrolled. No support was found for the mediation when controlling for familial confounding. Between‐pair associations were found between CM and AGG, and between CM and HAB. In addition, within‐pair associations were found between HAB and AGG, and between CM and AGG, however, these were nonsignificant in the discordant MZ analysis, offering the most stringent control of familial confounding. The results indicate the necessity of taking familial confounding into account when investigating the development of AGG.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite empirical support for “Self‐control theory” in criminology, there is controversy about how self‐control should be operationalized. Working within the framework of “self‐control theory,” we investigated if violence and criminal behaviors are associated with nine distinct dimensions of cognitive control in a community sample of young men ( n = 654) living in peri‐urban townships in South Africa. Cognitive control was assessed using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Multivariate statistical analysis was used, to identify associations between violence and criminality, and deaggregated measures of nine distinct components of cognitive control. Fifteen percent of the sample reported recent violence, 27% had been in physical fights with family/friends in the preceding 6 months, 10% reported being arrested, 4% reported forced sexual contact, and 26% reported intimate partner violence (IPV). Controlling for substance use and sociodemographic variables, contact with the criminal justice system and violence were associated with deficits in all domains of cognitive control. Forced sexual contact was associated with behavioral dysregulation. IPV was associated with behavior dysregulation and executive control dysfunction. Future studies might utilize deaggregated measures of self‐control to provide further insight into links between particular components of cognitive control and various forms of offending and violence.",

Community violence exposure also predicted higher levels of externalizing (β = .071, p < .01) and internalizing (β = .043, p < .05) behavior problems. Community violence exposure did not moderate the associations between maternal spanking and behavior problems.

We used two distinct methods (the mirror and the real opponent tests) to evaluate individual aggression and relate it to the activity and individual stress of chub ( Squalius cephalus L.). Three hypotheses were formulated and tested: (a) there is a significant positive relationship between the aggressiveness of individuals measured with the mirror and the real opponent tests, indicating their convergent validity; (b) the irregularities in response to the aggressiveness and activity tests lead to the context‐specific expression of the behavioral syndromes; and (c) there is a significant positive relationship between the stress induced in individuals by both tests of aggressiveness, demonstrating individually consistent stress‐coping strategies. The first and the second hypothesis were confirmed, while the third hypothesis was rejected. Our results suggest that particular tests of aggressiveness could act as a situation with high strength, leaving little variation between individual responses. Thus, we propose that for the proper interpretation of various studies using different tests to study identical behavioral traits, it is important to consider the convergent validity of not only the tested behavioral traits but also the individual stress responses. The chub also showed stress relieve through aggressiveness, suggesting the species as a prospective animal model to the study interaction between the stress and the aggressiveness. A detailed aggression ethogram of chub was provided to facilitate the use of this specie in future studies.",

Structural equational modeling was used to test transactional relations between BMI and bullying victimization. For self‐reported victimization, there was no concurrent or over time association between BMI and victimization for boys or girls in the present study. For peer‐reported victimization, we observed concurrent associations between BMI and victimization for boys and girls and a prospective relation where higher BMI corresponded to less victimization over time for boys. The study yielded mainly concurrent relations between BMI and victimization among adolescents in India. Results from western countries may not generalize to India.",

Applying a biopsychosocial approach, the aim of our study was to examine the relations between emotion‐related parenting behavior (ERPB, e.g., parental psychological control and parental emotion dysregulation) and childhood aggression with a focus on the potential moderating effects of parent‐child physiological synchrony on these relations. Eighty‐nine parent‐child dyads (total N = 178) participated in the study (child M age = 8.76 years, SD = 1.81 years, 49 boys). At T1, ERPB was observed and coded from dyadic interaction and parent‐child physiological synchrony was assessed using interbeat interval (IBI) calculated from the participant's heart rate (HR) during an interaction task. Parents also reported their child's aggressive behavior at T1 and 9 months later (T2). The results showed that for children demonstrating stronger physiological synchrony with their parents, higher levels of parental psychological control and parental emotion dysregulation predicted their more aggressive behavior. Our findings suggest that for certain negative types of ERPB, parent‐child physiological synchrony seems to be a risk factor for the development of children's aggressive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sexual violence victimization is a prevalent public health concern. However, little research has investigated the factors linking sexual violence victimization to suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). The current study tested the applicability of the psychological mediation framework, a coping‐mental health model, for the prevention of STBs among victims of sexual youviolence. Furthermore, the current study explored whether sexual orientation moderated the progression from sexual violence victimization to STBs. Data were drawn from an online survey of victimization experiences and health ( N = 2175). Bootstrap mediation tested whether the association of sexual violence victimization and STBs was mediated by emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and psychopathology (anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder). Multiple‐groups analysis tested whether links within the mediation effects varied by sexual orientation. Bivariate findings showed that: (1) sexual minority persons were more likely to report sexual violence victimization and (2) cognitive reappraisal was more meaningfully associated with mental health among sexual minority persons. Sexual violence victimization was associated with STBs via a serial mediation through emotion regulation and psychopathology. The association between psychopathology and STBs was stronger among sexual minority compared with heterosexual respondents. Physical violence victimization was associated with STBs for heterosexual but not sexual minority persons in a follow‐up model. Findings support an emotion regulation‐mental health framework for the prevention of suicide among victims of sexual violence. Research and training implications are discussed.",

Multilevel growth mixture modeling revealed (a) distinct trajectories of overt and relational aggression for boys and girls and (b) that norm salience (i.e., the process by which a group norm is made salient via the punishments or reinforcements to the behavior within the group) was a better predictor of associations with trajectories of overt and relational aggression than were perceived injunctive norms (i.e., the perceived standards of what is approved or disapproved in a social context). In classrooms where popular or accepted children were perceived by their peers as aggressive, more boys followed an increasing trajectory of overt and relational aggression than a low‐stable trajectory, and more girls followed a high‐stable trajectory of relational aggression than a low‐stable trajectory.

We examined how cognitive load might interfere with these aggression-reducing effects of inhibitory cues. Participants (N = 80) were randomly assigned to a condition in a 2 (cognitive load: high/low) × 2 (inhibiting cues: yes/no) between-subjects design. Following procedures in the TDA paradigm, participants received an initial provocation from the experimenter and a subsequent triggering annoyance from another individual. In the inhibitory cue condition, participants were told, before they had the opportunity to aggress, that others would learn of their aggressive responses. In the high cognitive load condition, participants rehearsed a 10-digit number while aggressing. Those in the low cognitive load condition rehearsed a three digit number. We found significant main effects of cognitive load and inhibitory cue, which were qualified by the expected load × inhibitory cue interaction. Thus, inhibitory cues reduced displaced aggression under low-cognitive load. However, when participants in the inhibitory cue condition were under cognitive load, aggression increased, suggesting that mental busyness interfered with the full use of inhibitory information.

Based on previous work on environmental perception, we examined the role of environmental resource and security in altering aggression level. In three experiments, participants were exposed to environments that varied in resource (High vs. Low) and security (High vs. Low) levels, after which aggression was measured. The environments were presented through visual priming (Experiments 1-2) and a first-person gameplay (Experiment 3). We observed a consistent resource-security interaction effect on aggression, operationalized as the level of noise blast (Experiment 1) and number of unpleasant pictures (Experiments 2-3) delivered to strangers by the participants. High resource levels associated with higher aggression in insecure conditions, but lower aggression in secure conditions. The findings suggest that the adaptive value of aggression varies under different environmental constraints.

Self‐report data provided by 845 early adolescent youth (406 boys, 439 girls) were analyzed in an effort to test the hypothesis that aggressive rather than nonaggressive delinquency precipitates a rise in delinquency through the intervening influence of cognitive impulsivity but not moral neutralization. The hypothesis stated that of the four models evaluated in this study (aggressive delinquency → moral neutralization → offense variety; aggressive delinquency → cognitive impulsivity → offense variety; nonaggressive delinquency → moral neutralization → offense variety; nonaggressive delinquency → cognitive impulsivity → offense variety), only the aggressive delinquency → cognitive impulsivity → offense variety model would achieve significance. Consistent with this hypothesis, only the aggressive delinquency → cognitive impulsivity → offense variety pathway was, in fact, significant. The current findings suggest that the psychological inertia process may be driven by a pattern of aggressive delinquency followed by cognitive impulsivity and that neither nonaggressive delinquency nor moral neutralization contribute to the process.

Counteracting this issue requires a better understanding of the factors that drive behaviors such as posting hate speech or making hateful comments. The present study contributes to this need by investigating the personal, social, and digital determinants for OHS perpetration. By conducting a two‐round Delphi study, data was collected from an interdisciplinary sample of experts. Practitioners were included in this sample to bridge gaps between research and fieldwork on OHS. The first survey collected information through open‐ended questions, which was then organized in different themes and lists of determinants in a thematic analysis. These determinants were rated for relevance in a follow‐up survey. Data analysis of the second survey used nonparametric statistics. From a total list of 129 determinants, the participants reached a consensus on 27 determinants as most relevant (median &gt; 4) for facilitating the production and dissemination of OHS. An ecological perspective was applied to interpret these findings. As a result, we propose an ecological model of personal, social, and digital determinants for online hate perpetration to illustrate their influence on individual behavior as well as their possible connections. The model provides a comprehensive overview of factors facilitating OHS perpetration, which can help to identify points for intervention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Experiencing victimization or mistreatment often induces feelings of anger. The catharsis hypothesis suggests that venting anger may aid in alleviating these negative emotions. Although this hypothesis has faced criticism, therapeutic interventions rooted in catharsis are employed to assist victims in managing their anger. One notable application of the catharsis principle in psychotherapeutic practice with victims involves engaging in aggressive fantasies: Victims who harbor aggressive fantasies against their offenders are supported in working with these fantasies to navigate the complex emotions arising from their victimization. Research investigating the effects of aggressive fantasizing on victims has yielded inconsistent findings, with some studies indicating positive and others suggesting negative outcomes. Herein, we examine whether (instructed) aggressive fantasizing diminishes (catharsis hypothesis) or heightens (escalation hypothesis) subsequent aggressive inclinations compared to non‐aggressive fantasizing. Additionally, the moderating role of victims' dispositional tendencies to express anger, specifically Anger Expression‐out and Anger Expression‐control, in the relationship between aggressive fantasizing and aggressive inclinations was examined. We recruited individuals ( N = 245) who had experienced victimization through highly unfair treatment and instructed them to imagine confronting their wrongdoer using either aggressive or non‐aggressive communication. Participants then reported their aggressive inclinations. Data supported the escalation hypothesis, revealing that aggressive fantasizing amplifies subsequent aggressive inclinations. Importantly, individuals with higher Anger Expression‐out demonstrated greater susceptibility to this effect; whereas, Anger Expression‐control did not moderate the link between aggressive fantasizing and inclinations. These findings further challenge the catharsis hypothesis and underscore the role of dispositional anger expression tendencies on the effects of aggressive fantasizing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Green spaces, integral to natural environments, have been extensively studied for their positive impact on mental health, yet their influence on social behavior, particularly aggression, is less explored. While prior research has predominantly emphasized the effects of actively engaging with nature, the significant role of passive nature exposure—a more common daily occurrence—has often been overlooked. We conducted two studies to explore the influence of passive green space exposure on aggression and the mediating effect of the sense of control. Study 1 ( N = 240) utilized a cross‐sectional survey to assess the relationship between passive green space exposure, sense of control, and aggression. Study 2 ( N = 260) employed a single‐factor between‐subjects experimental design to further explore these relationships in a controlled environment. The results from both studies indicated that passive green space exposure is negatively related to aggression, and that this relationship is partially mediated by an increased sense of control. Specifically, passive green space exposure was found to negatively predict aggression by bolstering individuals' sense of control. These findings underscore the potential of enhancing the sense of control through environmental factors like green spaces as an effective strategy to reduce aggression. This study enriches our understanding of the broader impacts of green spaces, extending beyond mental health to include social behaviors. We discussed both the theoretical and practical implications of our findings, highlighting how urban planning and environmental design can incorporate green spaces to foster community well‐being and mitigate aggressive behaviors.",

Participants were 485 middle school students (234 girls) attending the seventh or eighth grade at Time 1 (T1) ( M age = 12.67 years, SD = 1.14 years). Social anxiety and social withdrawal were assessed using subscales of the Social and Emotional Competencies Evaluation Questionnaire. Bullying perpetration and bullying victimization were assessed using the Bullying and Cyberbullying Behavior Questionnaire–Short Form. The within‐wave associations between the study variables were similar at T1 and Time 2 (T2), with the exception that the association between bullying perpetration and social anxiety was much weaker at T1 than at T2. The results of the path analysis showed that T1 bullying perpetration predicted T2 social anxiety, and that T1 bullying victimization predicted T2 social withdrawal. We also found a reciprocal relationship between social anxiety and social withdrawal. These findings highlight the importance of preventive and remediation interventions to reduce social anxiety in adolescents who engage in and experience bullying behavior.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Preventing aggression is a global social issue that warrants additional research with up‐to‐date measures. Aggressive behaviors manifest in several ways, and the proper assessment should capture its multidimensional nature. We developed the Forms and Functions of Aggressive Behavior Scale (FFABS) to capture the field's current multidimensional understanding of aggression, including its forms (physical, verbal, and relational) and functions (proactive and reactive). Across three studies ( N = 1388), we validated the factor structure of the FFABS, obtained partial scalar measurement invariance for males and females, and demonstrated consistent patterns with theoretically related stable constructs and with behavioral measures of inhibitory control and aggressive behaviors, establishing convergent and discriminant validity. We discuss the findings, limitations, practical implications, and future research directions.",

Previous studies have focused on limited factors using linear models, leading to oversimplified predictions. This study used the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) to identify and rank the importance of various risk and protective factors in cyber‐aggression. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique estimated each variable's predictive effects, and two‐dimensional partial dependence (PD) Plots examined interactions among predictors. Among 30 potential factors, the top five were attitudes toward violence, revenge motivation, anti‐bullying attitudes, moral disengagement, and anger rumination. PD analysis showed significant interactions between protective factors (anti‐bullying attitudes and moral reasoning) and risk factors (attitudes toward violence, revenge motivation, moral disengagement, and anger rumination). High scores on protective factors mitigated the impact of risk factors on cyber‐aggression. These findings support and expand GAM, offering implications for reducing cyber‐aggression among Chinese college students.",

Analyses of 100 dyadic fight videos addressing ethological, game theoretic and sex‐differentiated questions derived from research on other animals found that prefight verbalizations or gestural signals of nonaggressive or aggressive intent loosely predicted who would strike first and who would win. The head is the preferred strike target. Ordinal severity rankings of different strikes ranged from 1 for spitting to 5 for choking. Half the videos showed briefer, unilateral assaults beginning with one or more high severity strikes, little evidence of escalation and fewer bystander interventions. A quarter of these were sneak attacks. The other videos showed longer fights with reciprocal strikes, some evidence of strike severity escalation and more bystander intervention. Both types were equally injurious. Winner/loser outcomes were reliably identified by postfight behaviors and/or signs of injury. Winners had advantageous prefight resource holding potential (RHP: greater height and/or vigor) significantly more often than losers. Consistent with tendencies for fights to occur between animals of the same sex, there were more male/male and female/female fights and fewer male/female fights than expected from random pairings of men and women in the videos. Female/female fights involved proportionally more hair‐pulling, extended bouts of rapidly repeated strikes and longest durations. Bystanders intervened in over half the videos, attempting to separate fighters or help losers more often than they attacked the loser. Carefully selected internet street fight videos can provide important information.",

Sires from 18 pairs were removed after parturition of their offspring and replaced by unfamiliar males at different ages of the neonates. In group 1, containing six females with their offspring, the new male was introduced into the females' cages on day 1 after the parturition. In group 2 the new male was introduced on day 5 after parturition and in group 3 on day 9 after parturition. The male was removed after 3 days and the neonates recounted. Male common voles killed up to 100% of the neonates in litters containing neonates younger than 9 days by rapid bites to the head of the neonates (groups 1 and 2, mortality rates of 0.86 and 0.38). However, with older pups, a mortality rate of 0.06 was observed while 33% of the intruder males showed signs of injuries (group 3). These findings show that infanticidal behavior of male common voles represents one factor of pup mortality. The results are discussed in relation to changes in the degree of maternal aggression and in the context of the social system of the common vole for solving the conflict between postpartum estrous mating and infanticidal behavior of male common voles.

    "abstract": "Although it is frequently hypothesized that psychosocial factors influence the development of coronary heart disease and the underlying atherosclerosis, evidence directly supporting this hypothesis or identifying the mediating mechanisms has been sparse at best. The present article reviews research designed to elucidate the role of behavior in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (and thus coronary heart disease). Particular emphasis is placed on experimental evidence linking atherosclerosis to both behavior and sympathoadrenal activation in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). In males of this monkey species, behavioral dominance and aggression interact with social instability to promote the development of diet-induced atherosclerosis. Beta-adrenoreceptor blockade prevents this behavioral exacerbation of atherosclerosis, suggesting a mechanism of sympathetic origin. Furthermore, independently of social rank or environmental perturbation, animals exhibiting a heightened cardiac responsivity to stress are excessively aggressive and also develop the most extensive coronary lesions. Taken together, these experimental data strongly implicate aggressiveness and sympathetic arousal, occurring as a result of either inherent hypersensitivity or environmental stimulation, in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Additional data suggest that a specific neurotransmitter complex—the serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine) system—modulates factors associated with the expression of social dominance and exaggerated heart rate reactivity, perhaps thereby explaining a portion of variable susceptibility to atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.

    "abstract": "The blind mole rat (Spalax ehrenbergi) is a highly aggressive and solitary rodent that shows the most striking physiological and behavioral adaptations to underground life. The eyes are not detectable externally; they are atrophied and covered by a thick layer of skin. A considerable part of the orbit is occupied by a very large Harderian gland. The current study demonstrates that during autogrooming the mole rat expresses Harderian gland materials from the conjunctival sac to the external nares and spreads them onto the fur. In contrast to other rodents, the mole rat's grooming behavior is usually confined to the front part of the body and does not progress after the head wipes to ventrolateral torso licking. Moreover, in highly aggressive encounters grooming sometimes ceases after the second phase-the nose wipe bouts. The unique first phase of the mole rat's grooming consists of highly rapid strokes over the skinny border of the head, which we assume help to squeeze Harderian materials from the gland. Unlike other rodents, in which grooming occupies a considerable part of their waking time, mole rats, cage individually, rarely perform autogrooming behavior. Grooming in mole rats has been found to be highly correlated with aggressive encounters, and submissive animals exhibit significantly more grooming than their dominant opponents. It is speculated that the Harderian gland discharge may serve as an appeasing substance when mole rats meet to reduce the extreme aggressiveness typical of these subterranean rodents. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Two aggressive acts were presented. First, the bystander witnessed an acquaintance stealing from the victim. Second, the bystander witnessed an acquaintance hitting the victim. Participants were asked to indicate (a) if the bystander would do anything (bystander expected behavior), (b) what the bystander would do (expected behavioral action), (c) if the action would be the right thing to do (evaluation of bystander expected behavioral action), and (d) what the bystander should do in response to the violation (prescribed bystander behavioral action).

Forty-eight males (24 with scores in each of the upper and lower performance quartiles) participated in the full study. Half of the subjects competed in a Taylor aggression task where they received a monetary incentive for choosing lower shocks; the remainder competed without any monetary contingency. Aggression was defined as shock intensity delivered to a sham opponent. Shock intensity significantly increased as a main effect of lower cognitive performance, absence of monetary incentive, and provocation. In addition, provocation interacted significantly with test performance. Finally, individuals in the upper cognitive performance quartile showed significantly greater reductions of unprovoked aggression in response to monetary incentive.

Thirty male undergraduates used lists including aggressive (schema-consistent and schema-relevant), positive or prosocial (schema-inconsistent yet relevant), or entirely neutral (schema-irrelevant) words to write short stories (priming task), then received an opportunity to select videotaped film clips for viewing. Subjects primed by aggressive word lists included more aggression, anger, fear, and violence in their stories than did those in the aggression-inconsistent and aggression-irrelevant conditions, whereas aggression-inconsistent priming yielded more fun, helping, and joy than did other conditions. Aggressively primed subjects expressed more interest in films containing violence and hostility than did neutrally primed subjects, whereas aggression-inconsistent priming did not differ significantly from either aggressive (schema-consistent) or neutral (schema-irrelevant) priming.

Subordinate mice showed a marginally significant elevation in latencies to approach familiar, but not unfamiliar, dominant odors.

This study assessed the effect of a competitive game on heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in a sample of university students. In addition, the influence of anxiety and attributions of the outcome was also explored. Only winners significantly showed a rise in HR during the competition followed by a decrease along the posttask phase in addition to more internal attributions. On the contrary, the average HR for losers during the competition was lower compared with their baseline values. No differences depending on the outcome were found in BP. The cardiovascular response as well as the subjective interpretation of the outcome suggest a more active strategy employed by winners vs. a more passive strategy of losers. Future studies should specifically investigate the importance of coping strategies for psychophysiological adaptation to contests and for the outcome reached.

In addition to examining the occurrence of different types of aggression in these workplaces, the question of whether being a target of aggression is related to employees’ subjective well-being was addressed. One hundred sixty-nine participants (mainly 30–50 years of age) employed in a wide range of organizations in the public sector completed a questionnaire measuring four types of observed and experienced aggression: direct overt, indirect manipulative, covert insinuative, and rational-appearing aggression. Indirect manipulative and rational-appearing aggression were perceived to be the most widely used aggression styles in the work context. In the predominantly male workplaces, the men were perceived to use more of all types of aggression than in the predominantly female workplaces. The women’s aggression was not related to the relative number of females and males with whom they worked. Participants were divided into two groups on the basis of the extent to which they estimated themselves to be targets of workplace aggression. Those who considered themselves to be victims of workplace aggression suffered significantly more from psychosocial problems and physical symptoms than those who had been victimized to a lesser extent or not at all.

    "abstract": "Abstract A sample of 39 patients who had committed serious violent acts toward others were assessed with the revised Symptom Checklist (SCL‐90‐R). The SCL‐90‐R is a self‐report symptom inventory for the measurement of psychopathology in psychiatric and medical patients. In addition to the patients' self‐report, an observer‐rated SCL‐90‐R was obtained. This was accomplished by letting one pair of nurses complete SCL‐90‐R ratings for each patient. The first aim of the study was to compare the SCL‐90‐R self‐report scores of the patient sample with the psychiatric inpatient norms [Derogatis LR (1992): Clinical Psychometric Research Inc]. Another purpose of this study was to explore possible trends of discordance between the observer ratings and the self‐reports of the study group. Always considering the limitations of the small sample, it was nevertheless also of interest to look for possible sex differences and differences between violent subgroups and between diagnostic groups in the self‐reported scores as well as in the observer ratings. The most striking findings of the present study were that the self‐reported scores were lower than the inpatient norms for SCL‐90‐R and that the patients' self‐reported levels of distress were significantly lower than those found in the observer ratings. Underreporting of psychopathology as a marker of violence risk is discussed in light of these findings. In this study, women reported higher distress levels than men in the Interpersonal Sensitivity symptom dimension. There were no significant differences concerning SCL‐90‐R ratings between patients who had committed homicide, attempted homicide, or physically assaulted another person in a serious but not life‐threatening way.

    "abstract": "Abstract A relationship between alcohol intake and aggressive behavior has been demonstrated in both associational and laboratory studies. Among the factors that contribute to aggression during intoxication are a history of violence and the level of alcohol‐induced stimulation. In humans, excessive alcohol intake and alcoholism are predicted by decreased sensitivity, or a low level of response (LOR), to alcohol. In addition, aggressive behavior, LOR, and alcoholism have been attributed to CNS serotonergic dysfunction. Given that they are both related to diminished CNS serotonin, in this study we wanted to determine whether a low LOR to alcohol would be associated with aggression during intoxication in rhesus macaques. Adolescent rhesus macaques (N=115) received an intravenous dose of ethanol (2.2g/kg) and were scored for their levels of response for 30 minutes. Following provocation by an investigator, animals were then scored for aggressive behaviors (lunges, open‐mouth threats, stares, head‐bobs, and barks) for five minutes. At the approximate age of five years, animals were entered into a free‐access alcohol consumption study, during which they were allowed voluntary access for one hour/day, four days/week to aspartame‐sweetened alcohol or vehicle. Alcohol intake for each subject was determined using a computerized collar, which was detected by a station system that measured individual subject consumption rates. Data were analyzed using regression analyses and t‐tests. Decreased sensitivity to alcohol, alcohol‐induced increases in CSF MHPG, and pre‐alcohol CSF levels of 5–HIAA were associated independently with aggression during intoxication (r= −0.32, P= 0.0006 , r = − 0.29, P=0.01, and r= −0.21, P=0.02, respectively). High rates of alcohol‐related aggression predicted future alcohol consumption (r=0.27, p=0.004), even after controlling for rearing condition and monoamine metabolite concentrations, previously shown in these animals to predict alcohol consumption. By investigating the relationships between LOR, central catecholamine reactivity and function, and alcohol‐induced aggression in alcohol‐naïve nonhuman primates, this report provides evidence that alcohol‐induced stimulation and neurotransmitter‐linked predisposition to impulsive aggression independently contribute to aggression during intoxication. This paper further emphasizes the importance of the nonhuman primate model for studying susceptibility to alcohol‐related aggression and alcoholism, because variables such as prior exposure to alcohol are difficult to control in human subjects.

Subjects completed a questionnaire covering both perceived maternal control (PMC) and perceived maternal support (PMS). The SIP measures of hostile attribution of intent and hostile response selection were measured on the basis of responses to six ambiguous hypothetical stories depicting peer provocation. Results showed that PMC was associated positively with both the SIP measures, whereas PMS was associated negatively with both the SIP measures. Also, the effects of PMC on both the SIP measures were extenuated by low PMS. The findings are discussed in terms of how aggressive boys' perceptions of their relationships with their mothers, such as negative relational schemas, nuclear scripts, and insecure attachment histories, favor more hostile SIP.

Two aggressive subscales were developed: physical and verbal. The instrument controlled for the relationship (acquaintance vs. friend) of the witness to the perpetrator and to the victim involved in the event. Results provided evidence for a domain approach to judgments about active responses to aggression. Furthermore, as predicted, the factors of gender, age, relationship of the witness to both the victim and the perpetrator, and aggressive situation influenced adolescents’ judgments. Regardless of whether the perpetrator and the victim were acquaintances or friends of the witness, younger males indicated that they were less likely to respond to acts of physical aggression than were adolescents in the other three groups. In contrast, when acquaintances were involved in situations involving verbal aggression, younger males were less likely to respond than were younger females. When the perpetrator and the victim were friends of the witness, females, regardless of age, were more likely than males to respond to verbally aggressive acts. Aggr.

Urban environments are characterized by highly clumped distributions of food and shelter, allowing domestic cats to live in large multimale-multifemale groups. In such a situation, questions arise about male and female mating strategies. In particular, do females exert active mate choice? We tested this question using behavioural records on acceptance and refusal of males by estrous females. Our results showed that most females copulated with several males during a single estrus period. The variability of female behaviour was high: six females copulated with all courting males whereas three others mated with most courting males; six others copulated with half or less of the courting males. Even if some females copulated with certain males more often than with others, the identity of the most successful males changed each time. These results show that most females did not choose mates among different males available. The results are discussed in terms of optimal reproductive strategies of males and females in an urban environment. Aggr. Behav. 26:455–465, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "There are striking differences in the attack patterns induced by electrical stimulation in the same site in the hypothalamus in different strains of rats. The attack on the back of an opponent is the prevailing form in random-bred CPBWI albino Wistar rats. In the inbred CPBWEzob strain, hypothalamic stimulation does elicit predominantly head attacks and never back attacks. Attack patterns and wound patterns observed in both strains during maternal aggression, territorial conflicts, and hypothalamic stimulation suggest that hypothalamic attack is a behavioural category in its own right. We suggest that hypothalamic stimulation activates one single, multifunctional mechanism involved in the immediate organisation of attack patterns in the rat. During hypothalamic stimulation, this attack-releasing mechanism is activated artificially. Even at threshold intensity, electrical stimulation seems to override the brain mechanisms which in natural settings often keep the hypothalamic attack-releasing mechanism from expressing itself. Brain mechanisms coordinating adequate fighting should have considerable survival value. Strain differences suggest that the hypothalamic attack-releasing mechanism is somehow \"hardwired\" in the brain and may be subject to selection.",

Two other variables, however, were associated with aggression: identification with aggression and aggression consequences. These relationships also held up between families (BF, covariance of sibling' averages) and within families (WF, covariance of sibling' differences). The latter WF relationship indicated that one sibling was typically the more extreme on both aggression and its correlate than a brother or sister.

    "abstract": "It has been widely and regularly suggested that aggression is not a unitary concept but rather an omnibus term concealing important and distinct subclasses of behavior. Psychologists have offered various categorical schemes highlighting motivation and form as distinguishing criteria. Many writers have also noted the social relativity of dermitions of classes of aggression and called for a consideration of lay conceptions of aggressive behavior. The present paper explores the correspondence between psychologists' and laypersons' categorizations of aggressive acts. Ten short scenarios of aggression were generated to embody systematic permutations of form and motive as suggested by the published work of social psychologists. Subjects rated every pairwise combination in terms of perceived similarity. The data were subjected to three-factor, multidimensional scaling. The resulting structure indicated that subjects' ratings were not random and reflected consideration of motive (hostile, normative, instrumental, status) and of direct versus indirect form. The data were thus in close correspondence with the classifications generated by psychologists. The desirability of refining this technique and extending it to other cultural and subcultural groups is discussed.",

No significant difference in aggressive behaviors was noted when the comparison was done in the intruders.

Physically abusive parents and individuals at high-risk for child physical abuse are thought to present a deficit of empathy [e.g., Milner et al., Empathic responsiveness and affective reactivity to infant stimuli in high- and low-risk for physical child abuse mothers, Child Abuse Negl 19:767–780, 1995]. This study examined whether individuals at high-risk for child physical abuse show empathy and inhibit aggression when exposed to cues thought to be associated with victim suffering. Eighty undergraduate female students participated. A 2 × 2 factorial design based upon 2 levels of the participant's risk status (high, low) and 2 levels of victim's pain cues (present, absent) was employed. Findings suggest that high-risk participants in the pain cues condition selected higher intensities of shocks to aggress than high-risk participants in the absent cues condition. However, risk status was not associated with reports of personal distress or empathic concern. Aggress. Behav. 31:00–00, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Males attacked the bite-target more frequently than females, but this difference disappeared after castration when the response rate of the males approached that of the females. Ovariectomizing the females had little effect on their bite-attack frequencies. Subsequent androgen injections restored the biting-attack frequency of the castrated males to preoperative levels but had little effect on the intact males. Estrogen had little effect on the response frequency of the females, whereas androgen produced a slight increase in their bite-attack frequency. Results indicate that androgen is critical for the maintenance of this aggressive response and that the single subject paradigm utilized in this study was a sensitive measure of aggressive tendencies in mice.",

Two hundred and forty subjects (120 girls and 120 boys) aged between eight and twelve from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds were selected from three public or private elementary / secondary schools in Madrid, Spain. The first study used a questionnaire to examine the children's attitudes towards bullfighting by looking at their acceptance and cognitive‐emotional appraisal of the event. Videotapes of bullfights with differing commentaries were then used, along with a battery of questionnaires, to assess the emotional impact of these events, as well as the impact of narrative explanations on aggression and anxiety. Most children were not very positive about bullfights in the initial questionnaire. Viewing of tapes with ‘festive’ or aggressive dialogues (but not tapes without a justification) resulted in more expressed aggression in boys than girls. There was also evidence that age had a significant effect, and that some children appeared disturbed by the exposure. Aggr. Behav. 30:16–28, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

It is well‐known that the GABAergic system is involved in the modulation of aggression. However, the role of α5/GABA‐A receptors has not been explored. In this study, we examined the effect of L‐655,708 (0.625‐5 mg/kg), a selective ligand for the benzodiazepine site of GABA‐A receptors which contain the α5 subunit, on agonistic behavior elicited by isolation in male mice. Individually housed mice were exposed to an anosmic “standard opponent” 30 min after drug administration, and the encounters were videotaped and evaluated using an ethologically based analysis. L‐655,708 (5 mg/kg) exhibited an ethopharmacological profile characterized by a marked reduction of the time spent in offensive behavior (threat and attack) without affecting immobility, accompanied by a significant increase of avoidance/flee and nonsocial exploration behaviors, suggesting that the antiaggressive effect of the drug is unselective. Overall, this behavioral profile might indicate the existence of an anxiogenic‐like activity of L‐655,708 in mice. Aggr. Behav. 30:319–325, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that abusive parents and parents at high risk for child physical abuse could be more likely to view children's behavior as being motivated by hostile intent [e.g., Milner, 1993], as compared to nonabusive and low-risk parents. This kind of misattribution of other's behavior may inhibit empathic emotion, and therefore, could block the inhibiting effect of a victim's pain cues on aggression [Baron, 1979]. An experiment was designed to analyze the moderating effect of an adult victim's intent on aggression in high- and low-risk participants for child physical abuse. A 2 × 2 factorial design based upon two levels of the participant's risk status (high, low) and two levels of victim's intent (positive, ambiguous) was employed. All participants observed an adult victim's pain cues. Ninety-five (48 high and 47 low risk for child physical abuse) undergraduate females enrolled in courses at the University of the Basque Country participated in the experiment. The main effects of victims' intent and of participants' risk status were statistically significant. Participants in the ambiguous victim's intent condition aggressed significantly more than participants in the positive victim's intent condition. Moreover, high-risk participants aggressed more than low-risk participants regardless of the victim's intent. A significant interaction between risk status and victim's intent was expected. High-risk subjects for child physical abuse were expected to aggress more than low-risk subjects only in the ambiguous victim's intent condition. However, results did not support this hypothesis.

P300 event-related potentials were recorded from 32 healthy volunteers during a novel modified oddball task. The task required participants to respond only to rare, food words (targets), which occurred randomly among neutral words. Aggressive words appeared randomly with the same frequency as the target words. A median split divided subjects into high- and low-aggression groups based on their scores on the Buss–Durkee Hostility Inventory. The groups did not differ in their responses to the target words. Participants with higher aggression scores had lowered responses to the aggressive words at the frontal relative to the other electrode sites. Cognitive processing of aggressive stimuli was less efficient at frontal sites in individuals who reported higher levels of aggression.

    "abstract": "Abstract An important focus of recent aggression research has been to identify personality variables that influence the expression of aggression. One such variable may be anxiety sensitivity (AS). Individuals high in AS fear unpleasant anxiety‐related physiological sensations and perhaps physiological arousal in general. Accordingly, people high in AS are motivated to avoid situations that produce these sensations. With respect to aggressive encounters, an intense attack by an opponent involves significant physiological arousal. High anxiety‐sensitive individuals may therefore attempt to decrease the intensity of the interaction by responding in a non‐aggressive or conciliatory manner. To test this possibility, 112 community volunteers completed a measure of AS and a well‐validated laboratory task designed to assess aggressive behavior. As predicted, an inverse relation between AS and extreme aggressive responding was found. Specifically, as AS increases, retaliatory aggression is less likely after intense attack by an opponent.

The study addresses the lack of research into this specialized population to date, with a subsidiary aim of comparing the results directly with a previous study conducted with a population of adult male personality‐disordered offender‐patients ( n = 53). Participants were required to complete a self‐report behavioral checklist (Direct and Indirect Patient behavior Checklist‐Hospital version Revised). The prediction that indirect (subtle) aggression would be reported more frequently than direct aggression was supported in relation to perpetration estimates, with evidence such aggression was also more prevalent among personality‐disordered than mentally ill offender‐patients. As predicted verbal aggression was the most commonly reported direct behavior. Although it was predicted that those perpetrating aggression would present with increased experience with secure settings this was only supported with regard to bully‐victims. Contrary to the prediction made, those victimized did not present with less experience of secure settings. Consistent with the hypothesis, bully/victims were predicted by increased negative behavior toward staff and hospital rules. The results are discussed in relation to the environment in which the aggression is taking place with the implications for practice and future research outlined. Aggr.

This study aims to determine whether these drugs produce differential effects in adolescent (postnatal day: 36–37) and adult (postnatal day: 65–66) mice that have been housed individually for 2 weeks in order to induce aggressive behavior. Mice received BUP (40, 20, or 10 mg/kg), NIC (1, 0.5, and 0.25 mg/kg as base), or vehicle earlier to a social interaction test. BUP (40 mg/kg) decreased social investigation and increased nonsocial exploration in both adolescent and adult mice. The same effects were also observed in adult mice administered with a lower dose of the same drug (20 mg/kg). In adolescents, NIC (1 mg/kg) decreased social investigation, but this effect did not reach statistical significance in adults. In conclusion, a differential sensitivity to the effects of NIC or BUP emerged in some of the behavioral categories when the two age groups were compared. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Peaceful third‐party interventions usually occur after an aggressive encounter and can be directed toward the victim or the aggressor. Macaca tonkeana , a cercopithecine species characterized by high levels of tolerance, frequently engage in consolatory contacts, which both calm the victim and reduce the probability of further attacks against him/her. Other post‐conflict affiliative interventions such as reconciliation and quadratic affiliation are also common in this species. However, little attention has been given to contacts directed toward the aggressor. Here, we explore the role of bystander affiliative interventions toward the aggressor in influencing the affective state of the aggressor and the consequences of triadic interventions at group level. We found that triadic post‐conflict affiliation occurred independently from the intensity of the conflict and that it was more frequent in absence of the conciliatory contact between the opponents (reconciliation). Bystanders showed a higher amount of post‐conflict affiliation toward low ranking aggressors. Post‐conflict triadic affiliation functioned as a tension reduction mechanism by lowering the arousal of the aggressor, which less frequently engaged in renewed aggression.

To better understand the sociocultural mechanisms behind why underreporting may occur, three studies (total n = 1,481) examine how women's endorsement of honor values influence the perceptions of rape. Using vignettes that varied the closeness of the perpetrator of a sexual assault (i.e., stranger, acquaintance, or husband), we found that women who endorse honor values of womanhood were less likely to label a forced sexual act as “rape” and to suggest that the victim discloses the rape to others, including to the police. This was especially true the closer the victim was to the perpetrator (e.g., husband vs. stranger). Our findings highlight the effects of honor values on perceived sexual assault and the consequences of disclosure, and may aid in understanding barriers to rape reporting and areas for intervention.",

The current study examined how reactive aggression was affected by having sleep restricted to 4-hours on a single night, a level of disruption commonly experienced. Both rested and sleep-restricted participants completed the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), a laboratory task in which participants seek to earn points, are provoked by a fictitious opponent stealing their points, and may choose to steal points in response. Logistic mixed-effect models were used to investigate the effect of sleep restriction and the role of sex hormones on the odds of choosing to steal. For men, and women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, sleep restriction did not result in significant changes reactive aggression, although the patterns of aggressive behavior appeared less reactive and retaliatory in nature. For women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, sleep restriction was associated with higher levels of reactive aggression. For both men and women in the luteal phase, sleep restriction disrupted an association between hormone change over the task (testosterone and estradiol, respectively) and reactive aggression that was observed in their control participants. In addition, higher testosterone before the PSAP in men was associated with maintaining a high level of stealing over the task. These results indicate a complex dynamic in which sex hormones and sleep interact to predict aggressive behavior in response to provocation.",

In the present study, we sought to replicate the basic escalation effect within‐subjects. Further, in doing so, we controlled for experimenter “sanctioning” of killing that may have differed with key between‐subjects manipulations in the prior research. To control for this possible confound, the present experiment held experimenter instructions constant and examined whether killing naturally escalated within‐subjects across two 12‐sec bug‐killing tasks. Additionally, to verify that escalation is due to killing per se and not just physical practice of the procedure, we manipulated whether the procedure was described as real killing or simulated killing. Results showed that when participants thought they were killing bugs, the number of bugs put into the grinder increased from the first to the second killing task. No such escalation occurred when participants performed the procedure while knowing the killing was simulated. Thus, killing of bugs escalates and is not simply a consequence of perceived sanctioning of killing by an experimenter or simulated practice of the procedure.",

Furthermore, the biosocial model of violence and social push theory suggest sensation seeking may moderate the relationship between heart rate and aggression. In a sample of 128 college students (82.0% White; 73.4% female), the current study tested a moderation model as an alternative relationship between resting heart rate and sensation seeking in regard to aggression. Overall, the findings partially supported an interaction effect, whereby the relationship between heart rate and aggression was moderated by sensation seeking. Specifically, the oft‐noted relationship between low resting heart rate and increased aggression was found, but only for individuals with low levels of sensation seeking.

Thus, measurement of physiological reactivity could provide insight into mechanisms relevant to the etiology of sexual aggression. The relationship between sexual aggression and physiological reactivity was investigated in 78 community men (38 sexually aggressive and 40 non‐aggressive men). In a laboratory protocol, the men were exposed to neutral, negative‐affect‐inducing, and positive‐affect‐inducing stimuli. Men's salivary cortisol concentrations and electrodermal activity (EDA) were measured throughout the laboratory procedure. Sexually aggressive men demonstrated (1) lower overall cortisol levels and (2) lower EDA reactivity in some conditions as compared to non‐aggressive men. Results of this study were consistent with the idea that men's sexual aggression is associated with physiological hyporeactivity, a physiological profile that has been found to be associated with externalizing behaviors and psychopathic traits.

In the present study, we investigated the link between pure indegree centrality and aggression (i.e., overt and relational aggression), and examined moderating effects of moral disengagement on this association, among Chinese adolescents in classes with different percentage of aggressors. Participants were 589 sophomore students (446 boys, 75.72% of sample; M age = 15.98, SD = 0.64) from 16 classes in one vocational secondary school. The results showed that the effects for overt and relational aggression were moderated by the proportion of aggressors within classes and moral disengagement. For students in classes with a higher density of aggressors, there was a strong positive association between pure indegree centrality and overt aggression (but not relational aggression) for those students with higher moral disengagement. Conversely, in classes with fewer aggressive students, the covariation between centrality and both overt and relational aggression was negative for students with higher moral disengagement. These findings are consistent with an ecological perspective on the development of aggression, which shows that aggregating aggressive students in school classes may strengthen the associations between peer dynamics, moral disengagement, and aggressive behavior.",

Further, extant research has relied on retrospective reporting of behaviors, which may be subject to recall bias. The daily diary methodology enables the assessment of both the between‐ and within‐subject variation, as well as reduces the likelihood of biased reporting. Consequently, the current study utilized a daily diary design to examine (a) associations between daily alcohol use and alcohol‐related aggressive behaviors (i.e., direct and indirect); and (b) the co‐occurrence of alcohol‐related direct and indirect aggression. Participants were 105 (80% female) college student drinkers. Students completed baseline questionnaires and up to 14 consecutive, daily surveys regarding their previous day alcohol use, alcohol‐related direct aggression, and alcohol‐related indirect aggression. Findings revealed that alcohol use was associated with same day alcohol‐related direct and indirect aggression, after controlling for baseline alcohol use. Self‐reported alcohol‐related direct aggression was more likely to occur on days in which self‐reported alcohol‐related indirect aggression occurred, after controlling for dispositional aggression, trait self‐control, and baseline alcohol use. Results of the study suggest that, similar to alcohol‐related direct aggression, alcohol use is associated with an increased likelihood of alcohol‐related indirect aggression. Further, the co‐occurrence of alcohol‐related indirect and direct aggression supports that individuals may be engaging in multiple types of aggressive behaviors. Findings extend previous cross‐sectional and qualitative research suggesting that indirect aggression may co‐occur, perhaps increasing in severity.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to find that the relationship between resting heart rate and aggression is racially variant, suggesting that resting heart rate may not be a generalizable biomarker for conduct problems.

A sample of 305 middle school students (141 boys, 164 girls; 10–12 years of age) served as participants in this study. The research hypothesis predicted that parental support and knowledge would moderate the prospective bullying–delinquency relationship. Testing this hypothesis with least squares regression parametric coefficients and percentile bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, parental support received full support and parental knowledge no support as factors potentially capable of reducing risk for future delinquency by interacting with prior bullying perpetration. Whereas parental support decreased the odds of high bullying boys engaging in future delinquency—an outcome consistent with the view that parenting can serve a protective function against future offending by neutralizing the risk effect of bullying—parental knowledge failed to reduce future delinquency in children who bullied, although it did have a direct ameliorative effect on future delinquency. The protective effect was strongest when parental support was high and parental knowledge low, whereas the risk effect was strongest when parental support was low and parental knowledge was medium to high. These results suggest that protective and risk effects are limited to certain combinations of protective and risk factors.",

Across three samples (total N = 639), we conducted weighted mean analyses, multiple regression analyses, and dominance analyses to determine which FFM facets were the strongest predictors of aggression within and across domains. These analyses suggested that facets of Agreeableness were among the strongest consistent predictors of CRTT aggression, including Sympathy (r = -.21) and Cooperation (r = -.14), but facets from other FFM domains also yielded meaningful relations (e.g., Anger from Neuroticism; r = .17). We conclude by discussing these results in the context of controversies surrounding laboratory aggression paradigms and emphasizing the importance of considering small effect sizes in the prediction of societally harmful behavior like aggression.",

Four victimization (high victimization, homophobic name‐calling only, verbal sexual harassment only, and low victimization) and three substance use (poly‐substance use, alcohol, and cannabis only, low all) classes were identified. The high victimization and homophobic name‐calling only classes had the highest probabilities of transitioning into the poly‐substance use class , and the high victimization class had the highest probability of transitioning into the alcohol and cannabis only class. The probability of transitioning into the low all substance use class was highest in the low victimization class and lowest in the high victimization class. For the high victimization class, greater depressive symptoms increased the odds, and better peer relationship quality decreased the odds, of transitioning into the poly‐substance use and alcohol and cannabis only classes. For the homophobic name‐calling only class, greater depressive symptoms increased the odds of transitioning into the poly‐substance use class. Homophobic name‐calling, alone or in combination with verbal sexual harassment, is a risk factor for escalating substance use in young adulthood, especially among victims with depressive symptoms.",

Although this association has also been examined in abusive and neglectful parents, the results are mixed and do not adequately address child neglect. Based on the Social Information Processing model of child abuse and neglect, we examined the association between mothers' ability to recognize children's emotions and self‐ and professionals‐reported child abuse and neglect. The ability to recognize children's emotions was assessed with an implicit valence classification task and an emotion labeling task. A convenience sample of 166 mothers (78 with at least one child referred to Child Protection Services) completed the tasks. Child abuse and neglect were measured with self‐report and professionals‐report instruments. The moderating role of mothers' intellectual functioning and socioeconomic status were also examined. Results revealed that abusive mothers performed more poorly on the negative emotions recognition task, while neglectful mothers demonstrated a lower overall ability in recognizing children's emotions. When classifying the valence of emotions, mothers who obtained higher scores on child neglect presented a higher positivity bias particularly when their scores in measures of intellectual functioning were low. There was no moderation effect for socioeconomic status. Moreover, the results for child abuse were mainly observed with self‐report measures, while for child neglect, they predominantly emerged with professionals‐report. Our findings highlight the important contribution of the social information processing model in the context of child maltreatment, with implications for prevention and intervention addressed.",

This study explored the unique associations of peer relations with proactive and reactive cyber‐aggression and the possible mechanisms underlying them in a sample of adolescents using a longitudinal study design. A total of 829 middle school students completed the Cyber‐rage and Cyber‐reward Aggression Subscales of the Cyber‐Aggression Typology Questionnaire, the Peer Relations Scale, the Social Information Processing‐Attributional Bias Questionnaire, and the Self‐efficacy for Aggression Scale twice at a 6‐month interval. Multiple mediation analyses and bootstrapping were conducted using the Mplus 8 software. The results indicated that satisfying peer relations were negatively correlated with reactive cyber‐aggression and positively associated with proactive cyber‐aggression. Moreover, hostile intent attribution and self‐efficacy for aggression mediated the associations between peer relations and both functions of cyber‐aggression, however, in different ways. Unsatisfying peer relations were associated with higher levels of hostile intent attribution and lower levels of self‐efficacy for aggression and predicted increases in reactive cyber‐aggression. In contrast, satisfying peer relations were associated with lower levels of hostile intent attribution and higher levels of self‐efficacy for aggression and predicted increases in proactive cyber‐aggression. The findings indicated that different functions of cyber‐aggression might be related to different mediation mechanisms, which sheds light on the prevention of cyber‐aggression in the future.",

    "abstract": "Studies report that alcohol use is related to partner violence, but for many, alcohol use does not culminate in violence against partners. Guided by a self-regulatory failure framework, we predicted that alcohol use would be more strongly associated with dating violence perpetration among adolescents with genotypes linked to impulsivity and emotional reactivity. The hypothesis was tested using random coefficient modeling of data from a multi-wave longitudinal study spanning grades 8–12 (ages 13–18) (n = 1,475). Analyses adjusted for multiple testing and race, and the potential for gene by environment correlation was examined. As predicted, alcohol use was more strongly associated with dating violence among adolescents who had a high rather than a low multilocus genetic profile composed of five genetic markers that influence dopamine signaling. Alcohol use was more strongly related to dating violence among boys with long rather than short 5-HTTLPR alleles, the opposite of the prediction. MAOA-uVNTR did not interact with alcohol, but it had a main effect on dating violence by boys in later grades in the expected direction: boys with more low activity alleles perpetrated more dating violence. Exploratory analyses found variation in findings by race. Our findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating genes into etiological studies of adolescent dating violence, which to date has not been done. Aggr. Behav. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous studies have shown that competitive video gaming is associated with aggression; however, little is known about the relationship between personal competitive factors and aggression. Thus, we used structural equation modeling to examine the association between competitive game motivation and trait aggression, as well as the potential mediating roles of avatar identification and game aggression, among 1584 (59.66% male; M age = 14.58 years, SD = 1.49, range = 12–19) Chinese adolescent players of Glory of the King . The results showed that the direct effect of competitive game motivation on trait aggression was statistically significant, as were the indirect effects of competitive motivation—via both avatar identification and game aggression—on the three indicators of aggressive behavioral tendencies in everyday life. These results support the General Aggression Model, suggesting that competitive motivation is a personal factor predicting trait aggression. It contributes to our understanding of the roles of competition in video gamers' real‐life aggressive behavior from an individual perspective.",

It finds that childhood experiences of low family income and domestic abuse between parents predict weapon involvement at age 17 years. Other predictors include childhood externalizing problems and self-harm in early adolescence. Further early adolescent behaviors and experiences that predict weapon involvement are own substance use, peer substance use, school exclusion, and high levels of electronic gaming. These findings provide concrete areas for targeting risk factors both in childhood and the early adolescent period, with an indication that early intervention and prevention are likely to reduce the need for later action.",

    "abstract": "Using both correlational and experimental designs across four studies (N = 1251 working individuals), the current project aimed to contribute to the understanding of workplace ostracism by studying two research questions. First, we tested whether the subjective experience of targets reflects the current theorizing of ostracism. Second, drawing from the transactional theory of stress and coping, we investigated whether this subjective experience impacts targets' coping responses. Findings based on exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the current theorizing of workplace ostracism such that perceived intensity, intent, and ambiguity were reflected in how targets appraised being ostracized at work. The appraisals were also related to coping responses. Perceived intensity predicted more approach-oriented (e.g., confrontation) and less avoidance-oriented coping responses (e.g., minimization). While attributions of intent also predicted some coping responses (e.g., instrumental support seeking), the explanatory power of perceived ambiguity was lower than the other two appraisals. Although these researcher-defined dimensions may be reflective of targets' experience, we propose that predictions made based on these dimensions need further refinement. The theoretical and practical significance of these findings are discussed in relation to how workplace ostracism is typically studied in the literature.",

Preventative resources at individual, family, and community levels may reduce risk, yet the extent to which youth violence perpetration differs by patterns of risk and protective factors remains unknown. Using data from the Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey ( N = 4630; 49% female; M age = 14.69), we conducted person‐centered, latent profile analyses to identify four patterns for risk of violence perpetration among middle and high school youth. Youth in the Low Risk‐High Protection profile (37%) had low likelihood of violence perpetration. Youth in the Low Risk‐Low Protection profile (4%) were characterized by poor family functioning, low school belonging, and low community protection. These youth had similar odds of violence perpetration as youth in the Moderate Risk‐Moderate Protection profile (44%), which were elevated compared to the Low Risk‐High Protection profile. Youth in the High Risk‐Low Protection profile (15%), which had the highest levels of risk factors and lowest levels of protective factors, had the highest likelihood of violence perpetration. The High Risk‐Low Protection profile was expected based on past research, but the emergence of the Low Risk‐Low Protection profile is a unique contribution to the research. Findings contribute to the literature by going beyond a cumulative risk model, identifying subgroups with various patterns of risk and protection in the population, and highlighting the importance of selected prevention for subgroups of youth with high risk or challenging family and community environments.",

    "abstract": "In general, individuals with low levels of coercive power are at greater risk of victimization than those who are more powerful. However, in some circumstances, superior coercive power increases an individual's vulnerability. In this paper, I show how coercive power can increase vulnerability (offsetting its protective effect) by its effects on targeting and tactics. Individuals with greater coercive power can increase their risk of getting targeted because they tend to be less vigilant and more likely to behave in ways that provoke others. They generate more grievances and have more enemies because they are less compliant and more verbally aggressive and confrontational. Powerful parties are also at greater risk of being targeted by adversaries seeking to gain status. An attack on a strong adversary is more likely to enhance status than an attack on a weaker adversary since it is a greater achievement. Individuals with coercive power are also at greater risk because of the tactics used by their weaker adversaries. Weaker parties are more likely to engage in pre-emptive attack and use weapons. They are better able to attract and rely on allies because of the norm of social responsibility, that is, the tendency to protect those in need. Finally, they are more likely to attempt to kill more power adversaries in order to incapacitate them and, thereby, avoid retaliation.",

Based on the General Aggression Model (GAM), this cross-sectional study examined the interactive effect of individuals (i.e., belief in a just world [BJW]) and situational factors (i.e., violent video game exposure [VVGE]) on bullying perpetration. Using a representative sample of 4250 adolescents from five secondary schools in Southwest China (54.4% males, Mage = 15.14, SD = 1.5 years old), we examined the moderating role of BJW in the relationship between VVGE and bullying perpetration. The results suggest that VVGE is significantly and positively associated with bullying perpetration. Moreover, after controlling for covariates, general and personal BJW interact with the situational variable (i.e., VVGE) to predict bullying perpetration among Chinese adolescents. The positive effect of VVGE on bullying perpetration is lower among adolescents with high general and personal BJW than among adolescents with low BJW. The findings support the GAM theory and highlight the buffering role of BJW in the effect of VVGE on bullying perpetration.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies on personality traits conducive to traditional bullying and cyberbullying mentioned Machiavellianism as an influential predictor of these behaviors. Machiavellianism comprises manipulative, egotistic orientations that help acquire desired outcomes. However, it is questionable whether bullying and cyberbullying reflect unidimensional constructs since they are frequently categorized into verbal, relational, and physical aspects (with the latter being applicable only in traditional bullying). Similarly, evidence suggests that Machiavellianism is not a uniform trait. In this research, using a sample of 634 students (339 girls; 54%) from 40 classes from eighth to tenth grades, a five-dimensional measure of bullying and cyberbullying was devised and suggested that aspects of (cyber)bullying are related but still separable. Subsequently, differential relations between the five forms of (cyber)bullying and two facets of Machiavellianism were modeled. Those facets were Machiavellian approach (i.e., manipulative aspects of Machiavellianism) and Machiavellian avoidance (i.e., distrustful aspects of Machiavellianism). Multilevel models revealed that Machiavellian approach predicted relational bullying (but not relational cyberbullying) and Machiavellian avoidance predicted verbal (cyber)bullying and physical bullying. All links were mediated by overt dehumanization, that is, the tendency to cognitively deprive a person of typically human characteristics.",

To remedy this research gap, this study hypothesized and tested a serial mediation model in which teacher preference is related to adolescents' aggressive behavior via the indirect paths of forming peer rejection and shaping rejection sensitivity. Using a longitudinal design, two-wave data were obtained from 2270 Chinese adolescents (initial age = 13.93 ± 0.59, 50.7% boys) over 6 months. The results revealed that teacher preference was negatively associated with aggressive behavior in adolescents, and the mediation model indicated peer rejection and rejection sensitivity served as serial mediators between this link. Additionally, the current study examined the unique affiliations of anxiety and anger about rejection with aggressive behavior respectively, with results supporting them as distinct constructs and highlighting the significance of research integrating both forms of rejection sensitivity. Differences were also identified regarding the role of anxious rejection sensitivity in predicting proactive and reactive aggressive behaviors. The educational implications of these findings and directions for forthcoming research were discussed.",

Biol Bull 194:63–71], we showed that, with one exception, gravid females did not respond to an unfamiliar stimulus with escape swimming. Here we present quantitative evidence showing that gravid female lobsters are more aggressive than non-gravid females. Gravid and non-gravid females were allowed to fight against larger, non-gravid female opponents in an enclosed arena. The videotaped behaviors were ranked in a behavioral hierarchy (Rank of Aggression) according to their degree of aggressiveness and intensity. The behaviors were classified and ranked as follows: (1) aggression toward opponent, (2) redirected aggressive behavior (toward arena wall), (3) redirected defensive behavior, (4) defensive behavior against opponent, and (5) avoidance behavior. Gravid lobsters performed more behaviors and more aggressive behaviors than did non-gravid controls. The behaviors of gravid females ranked higher on the Rank of Aggression scale than did non-gravid females. The opponents of gravid females performed more aggressive and more intensely aggressive acts than the opponents of non-gravid females; they also performed more defensive acts (i.e., those used to ward off an opponent's attack) than did their non-gravid opponents, although there were no differences in intensity of defensive behaviors between gravid and non-gravid animals. There were no significant differences in the number of avoidance behaviors among the four types of combatants (gravid, non-gravid, gravid opponent, and non-gravid opponent), and none in avoidance tailflipping. However, gravid females were more likely to perform aggressive tailflips and performed significantly more aggressive tailflips than non-gravid animals. Together, this suggests that any physiological inhibition of escape swimming may have been overcome by the heightened intensity of gravid fights and the increased aggressiveness of gravid animals.

    "abstract": "In the early stages of an agonistic encounter between mice, the loser of the conflict initially exhibits pronounced flight and escape attempts. When exposure to attack is prolonged, however, defeated mice display a decrease in these active defenses and become increasingly passive. The generality of such defeat-induced passivity was investigated in the present study by examining acutely defeated mice in the forced swim test, a nonsocial but threatening environment that normally engenders high levels of escape behavior. In the present experimental model, highly aggressive male C57BL/6 mice were used to defeat smaller male intruders of the DBA/2 strain in a series of brief (2-min) encounters spaced 2 min apart. In Experiment 1, DBA/2 mice were administered four defeat encounters and were then given a 10-min swim test following a postdefeat delay of 0, 30, or 60 min. Activity in the swim test was determined both by a novel, automated device that detected movement-induced perturbations in the water medium via infrared beam interruptions and by the standard observational measurement of percent time immobile. Both activity measures indicated a significant suppression effect of defeat on swim activity, the magnitude of which declined steadily as the delay between the defeat encounters and the swim test increased. In Experiment 2, DBA/2 mice experienced zero, one, two, three, or four defeat encounters spaced 2 min apart and were administered the swim test 30 min following the last defeat encounter. Activity in the swim test decreased as the number of defeat encounters increased. The present findings suggest that defeat-induced passivity in mice is of a global nature, persisting in other threatening environments in which high levels of escape activity would normally be observed. Similarities between the parameters of the present phenomenon and those of opioid-mediated defeat analgesia are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 24:257–269, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a powerful inhibitor of aggression in murine models when given for 15 days and potentially may be useful in the management of inappropriate human aggression. Although the biosynthesis and metabolism of DHEA have been described, little is known about the potential effect of the steroidal environment during sexual differentiation on the subsequent response to DHEA. Whether prenatal androgen exposure influences the subsequent response to DHEA was assessed by comparing the effect of DHEA (80 μg/d) on aggression in female offspring where dams were treated with 1, 10, or 100 μg of testosterone (T) on days 15 to 18 of gestation (Experiment I) or that developed in different uterine positions (Experiment II). The results showed that DHEA decreased attack behavior in general and that the 100‐μg prenatal T treatments enhanced the antiaggressive effect of this neurosteroid. Neither the lower doses of exogenously administered T nor the uterine position led to an enhanced response to DHEA. In addition, whether DHEA produced changes in social and nonsocial activities was examined. In the 100‐μg T females, DHEA increased the duration of the former and decreased the frequency and duration of the latter, indicating that it was not a general decrement in behavioral expression that mediated the enhanced response to the antiaggressive effect of DHEA.

However, the uterine positions × treatment interactions were not significant, demonstrating that contiguity to male fetuses did not differentially affect the response to DHEA. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Is aggressive behaviour in preschool more closely related to individual characteristics of the child as assessed at home, to aspects of mother-child interaction, or to the motherchild relationship? The issue was studied in three replications. Aggression in preschool was related to temperamental characteristics in girls but not boys, and to Self-esteem. There were very few significant correlations between aspects of mother-child interaction and hostility in preschool, but hostility with peers was related to the absence of positive or presence of mildly negative interactions with the sibling. Aggression in preschool was related to an aspect of the mother-child relationship; least aggression was shown by those childred whose mothers used warmth and control more or less “in balance” (authortative Mothers). Such children also differed in other aspects of the mother-child relationship, and these provided some explanation of those children who appeared to be exceptions to the “balance” hypethesis. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Feeding rats defend a food item from an approaching conspecific by turning away, laterally, about 180°. Females and males use a different composition of movements and stepping patterns to perform these defensive dodges. This study was designed to examine the role of the robber's sex on the execution of sex-typical patterns of dodging. All subjects were tested with a partner of each sex. During dodging, females used the female-typical pattern of pivoting around the pelvis, and males used the male-typical midbody pivot, irrespective of the robber's sex. These findings show that the sex-typical patterns of dodging are not determined by the sex of the partner. Females and males however, differed in how they were oriented towards a same sex robber at the end of the dodge. This suggests that while male and female robbers must pose different defensive problems, these differences are dealt with by modifying the sex-typical pattern of dodging rather than by switching to the dodge pattern of the opposite sex. This further suggests that the differences in the composition of the dodge pattern in males and females are not due to extrinsic contingencies, but rather, are due to intrinsic differences in the sex-typical organization of defensive motor patterns.

Aggressive and non-aggressive behaviors of adult bank vole females were investigated with a home cage test during 10 min sessions. The number of attacks was significantly higher in virgin females kept with intact adult males than in singly reared females or those exposed to male urine. Bulbectomy of the tested females completely inhibited the male stimulating effect. This indicates that males influence the behavior of females by activating their olfactory systems. Aggressive behavior in pregnant or lactating females, which is linked to maternal behavior, was also tested. Female bank voles between 11 and 17 days of pregnancy or lactating at 3–4 days or 9–10 days attacked their partners significantly more frequently than virgins did.

    "abstract": "The body targets contacted, the type of contact made, and the patterns of defense and counterattack elicited by those attacks are examined in the play fighting of captive male and female pairs of grasshopper mice. The nape was the most frequently contacted body target, irrespective of the type of contact made, be it nosing, allogrooming, biting, or striking with a forepaw. The types of defense varied with both body area contacted and type of attack performed. Based on the topography and pattern of contact, it was concluded that grasshopper mice, as is the case for many other muroid rodents, primarily attack and defend targets otherwise contacted during precopulatory encounters. However, grasshopper mice, which are obligate carnivores, also attack and defend predatory targets, although less frequently than sociosexual targets. Surprisingly, predatory attacks were more likely to be counterattacked with predatory attacks, whereas sociosexual attacks were more likely to be counterattacked with sociosexual attacks. Conspecific aggression involves bites directed at the face, lower flanks, and dorsum. Neither the biting of these areas nor the tactics of attack and defense usually associated with such bites were observed during the juvenile interactions. There were no sex differences in either frequency or patterns of attack and defense in play fighting. The data presented for grasshopper mice shed light on the issue of mixing behavior patterns from multiple functional systems during play. Aggr. Behav. 26:319–334, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The effects of benzodiazepines on various types of aggression have been extensively studied. These substances produce their pharmacological effects by allosterically modulating the action of GABA via specific recognition sites on the GABA A receptor called omega 1 and omega 2. The antiaggressive profile of non‐benzodiazepine compounds that also act at omega sites, such as zopiclone (a non‐selective omega 1 and 2 ligand) and zolpidem (a selective omega 1 ligand) has been scarcely explored. In this study, we examined the action of zolpidem (0.75‐3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and zopiclone (1.5‐6 mg/kg), administered acutely or subchronically for 10 days, on agonistic behavior elicited by isolation in male mice. Individually housed mice were exposed to anosmic “standard opponents” 30 min after drug administration, and the encounters were videotaped and evaluated using an ethologically based analysis. Acute treatment with zopiclone produced a marked antiaggressive effect, reducing offensive behaviors (threat and attack) at all doses used (1.5, 3, and 6 mg/kg) without affecting immobility. Likewise, the intermediate dose of zolpidem (1.5 mg/kg) significantly decreased aggression in a specific manner, without altering immobility, whereas the highest dose (3 mg/kg) provoked a reduction of aggression accompanied by a weak (but significant) increase of immobility. With repeated treatment, no tolerance to the antiaggressive effects of zopiclone and zolpidem was developed. It is concluded that omega sites at the GABA A receptor could be involved in the control of aggression. Aggr. Behav. 28:416–425, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Beyond this density, resident aggressiveness decreases. The number of aggressive interactions that the resident fish devotes to expelling each intruder shows a clear and significant tendency to decrease as competitor density increases. The resident fish is incapable of rapidly evaluating the outweighing of its capacity for defense. Moreover, the strategy of aggressive defense of the resource against the density of competitors does not seem to be only profitability criteria dependent, but rather there is also a significant influence of the ability to fight shown by the resident.

The present study investigates the relationship between the subjective perception of external stress factors and homicide and robbery rates, within a stress model according to which the probability of violence as a reaction to stress will increase when social support systems fail or malfunction. In the present context, subjective perception of social stress is conceived as expressions of worry or dissatisfaction regarding cardinal life domains such as the economic, security, or political situation. Support systems are defined here in terms of national solidarity, which is expressed as positive (or improved) attitudes regarding the relations between various segments of the population. The data regarding the subjective indicators were derived from continuing surveys of representative samples of urban Israeli population during the years 1967–1985. Fourteen stress indicators and two solidarity indicators were included. The periods covered range from less than 4 years to more than 16 years. The theoretical model was generally supported by the findings: both homicide and robbery were found to be related to most of the stress indicators as predicted. The two solidarity indicators were in line with the model in respect of robbery but not homicide. The consistency of the findings with the model is particularly noteworthy in view of the great variation among the independent variables regarding the number of observations and periods of time covered. Some theoretical implications of the findings are discussed, and suggestions are made for future research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Selectively bred low‐aggressive mice are frequently observed to freeze on social contact, despite the fact that this behavior was never a direct target of selection. To elucidate this finding, the present research aimed to identify the possible functions freezing may serve in social interactions. It was hypothesized that freezing may modify social interactions through self‐regulatory mechanisms and/or via its modulating effects on the actions of social partners. These hypotheses were evaluated with respect to the sequential changes observed over the course of a 10‐min dyadic test in freezing, social reactivity, and approaches among juvenile (24–30‐day‐old) mice from the NC900 and NC100 high‐ and low‐aggressive lines. Analyses of the patterns of social interactions between subjects and partners revealed two primary results. First, freezing was more than an expression of fear; it also functioned as a regulator of emotional arousal, as suggested by the substantial reduction of reactive behaviors seen in animals that showed high levels of freezing. Second, freezing functioned to facilitate high levels of affiliative social interaction with social partners. The implications of these results for understanding how the differentiation of the NC900 and NC100 occurred within microevolution and development are discussed. Aggr.

The frequencies of display behavior, threat and physical aggression were examined and related to the amount of attention a child received from his peers. The attention-rank had proved to be highly related to leadership abilities as well as dominance in children. The results show interesting similarities between the frequency and temporal patterns of display and threat behavior and the attention children pay to each other. Furthermore, older children with more kindergarten experience as well as high status children show a different temporal pattern (high frequencies after holidays and low frequencies before) as well as a higher frequency of display and threat behavior than younger and low status children. Physical aggression is related to attention-rank but shows quite a different temporal pattern. It seems that display or showing off behavior serves as a strategy for children to get high regard in the group.",

Two studies are reported in which the effects of naloxone on this differential response pattern were assessed. In the first study, lactating residents were pretreated with saline or naloxone (0.5, 2.5 mg/kg) and consecutively confronted with intruders of differing sex. Results suggested that attack (offensive) against female conspecifics is more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of opiate-receptor blockade than attack (defensive) on males. This conclusion was strengthened in a follow-up study, in which independent groups of lactating residents were used to further examine the effects of naloxone (0.5 mg/kg) on response to male and female intrusion. Analysis indicated that this low dose of naloxone significantly inhibited attack on female, but not on male, intruders. Indeed, in response to male, but not to female, intrusion, naloxone-treated residents showed a significant increase in fear-related behaviour. Findings are discussed in relation to the motivational differences in the response of lactating mice to intruders of differing sex and to possible mechanisms underlying the reported differential effects of opiate-receptor blockade.",

There was a subsidiary aim of examining the prevalence and characteristics of four categories of patients, namely ‘pure bullies,’ ‘bully/victims,’ ‘pure victims,’ and those ‘not-involved.’ It was predicted that patients would report more indirect than direct bullying behaviours and that bully/victims would represent the most prevalent category overall. It was also predicted that the four bully-categories would be predicted by the behaviours that they demonstrated. The sample consisted of 53 adult male patients. Bullying behaviour was assessed using the Direct and Indirect Patient behaviour Checklist – Hospital version (DIPC-H). Approximately half of all patients reported engaging in at least one interaction defined as ‘bullying others’ in the previous week. Estimates of behaviours indicative of ‘being bullied’ were markedly higher with over half reporting at least one interaction in the previous week. Indirect aggression was reported more frequently than direct aggression. Within direct aggression, verbal behaviours were reported most frequently. Bully/victims were found to represent the most prevalent category with just over one-third of all patients classified as such followed by pure victims, pure bullies, and those not-involved. The categories were not predicted by personal/descriptive characteristics such as age, ethnic origin; length of time spent in the hospital, on the ward, and in secure settings throughout their life.

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examined the relationship between alcohol, anger, and aggression in high school students. Anger and three types of aggressive expression (verbal, physical toward people, and physical toward objects) were evaluated cross‐sectionally and prospectively, via structural equation modeling for relationships to alcohol use in Mexican American and white non‐Latino 9–10th (Time 1) and 11–12th grade (Time 2) students. At both times cross‐sectionally, anger and aggressive anger expression tended to correlate positively with alcohol use in each ethnicity/gender group. However, prospectively, aggressive forms of anger expression tended not to be related to alcohol use two years later. Only verbally aggressive anger expression was related to alcohol use two years later and then, only for Mexican American and white non‐Latino females. There was, therefore, little basis for causal links between aggressive anger expression and alcohol use in a general population of high school students. Aggress.

[2000] specifically query the factor structure of Expagg using this technique. In this paper we report unsuccessful attempts to confirm the factor structure of three widely used scales using CFA criteria. In the fourth study, a two‐factor model of Expagg, which has been derived from previous studies, is tested for fit on new data. The results suggest that from a CFA point of view, Expagg is best considered as two scales measuring expressivity and instrumentality with five items on each scale. This model satisfies four of the five fit criteria (CFI = 90, GFI = .94, RMSEA = .08, ECVI = .44), failing only on the chi square test, a benchmark that has attracted criticism from statisticians. Other concerns are raised about the meaning of CFA results and their importance. Aggr. Behav. 30:146–157, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

The results showed that resident females of the C57 and Swiss strain vigorously attack lactating intruders introduced into their cages. This effect was mediated by urinary cues emitted by the latter mice. It was also shown that Swiss residents displayed aggression towards nonlactating females, irrespective of their strain. Groups of C57 residents reacted most aggressively towards Swiss females, less aggressively towards C3H intruders, but did not show any aggression towards their own nonlactating conspecifics. In contrast, none of the C3H resident female groups displayed aggression towards intruding females of any category or strain. The results also showed that the males of the three strains displayed little (Swiss and C3H) or no aggression (C57) towards familiar opponents, whereas they directed increased aggressive responses towards unfamiliar ones. Comparisons among the three strains of mice revealed that Swiss males were the most aggressive in either situation. On the other hand, the finding that C3H males showed aggressive responses suggested that male and female aggression are, in this strain, under separate genetic or hormonal control.",

Therefore, a common arousal mechanism may underlie a number of diverse agonistic responses.

However, the question of whether passive exposure to aggression can exclusively cause a risk of aggressive inclination for observers through a learning process, rather than mimicry effect, has not been readily addressed in the clinical literature. This study aimed to investigate this question by using a simple animal model to test the behavioral effect of chronic passive exposure to aggression. Our results indicate that observer rats that had been passively exposed to aggression for 10 min per day for 23 consecutive days exhibited more aggressive behavior than controls or those groups undergoing a single exposure to passive aggression. Furthermore, aggression levels in the group of 23‐day chronic exposure to aggression lasted 16 days after the recovery from exposure to aggression. These data suggest that the development of aggression in this model occurred through a learning process because only chronic exposure to aggression resulted in this behavioral outcome in the long run.

    "abstract": "Dysfunctional anger, though not a primary clinical diagnosis per se, does present clinically as a pathological mood for which treatment is sought. Few studies have probed the neurocortical correlates of dysfunctional anger or assessed if cognitive processes, such as attention, are altered in dysfunctional anger. Though dysfunctional and high trait anger appears to be associated with biased processing of anger‐eliciting information, few studies have examined if dysfunctional anger modulates attention more generally. This is a notable gap as volitional attention control is associated with effective emotive regulation, which is impaired in dysfunctional anger and in associated acts of aggression. In this pilot study, we examined performance and electroencephalographic ( EEG ) profiles during a 12‐min continuous performance task ( CPT ) of sustained attention in 15 adults with dysfunctional anger (Anger group) and 14 controls (control group). The Anger group had fewer hits at the end of the CPT , which correlated with decreased frontocortical activation, suggesting decreased engagement of frontal circuits when attention is taxed. The Anger group had more false alarms overall indicating impaired response inhibition. Increased right cortical activation during the initial portion of CPT existed in the Anger group, perhaps reflecting greater engagement of frontal circuits (i.e. effort) during initial stages of the task compared to controls. Finally, increased overall beta 1 power, suggesting increased cortical activation, was noted in the Anger group. These EEG patterns suggest a hypervigilant state in dysfunctional anger, which may interfere with effective attention control and decrease inhibition. Such impairments likely extend beyond the laboratory setting, and may associate with aggressive acts in real life. Aggr. Behav. 38:469‐480, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Social scripts are commonly shared representations of behavior in social contexts, which are seen to be partly transmitted through social and cultural media. Research suggests that people hold scripts associated with alcohol‐related aggression, but, unlike general aggression scripts, there is little evidence of social transmission. To demonstrate social transmission of alcohol‐related aggression scripts, learning mechanisms based on personal experience should be minimized. We used a lexical decision task to examine implicit links between alcohol and aggression in alcohol‐naïve adolescents who have limited personal or vicarious experience of alcohol‐related aggression. One hundred and four 11–14 year old adolescents made lexical decisions on aggressive or nonaggressive words preceded by 40‐ms alcohol or nonalcohol word primes. Repeated measures analyses of group data showed that alcohol word primes did not lead to faster responses to aggressive words than to nonaggressive words, nor were responses to aggressive words faster when they were preceded by alcohol word primes than by nonalcohol word primes. However, at an individual level, faster recognition times to the alcohol prime/aggression target word combination predicted aggression on a competitive laboratory task in 14 year olds only. This occurred only when the competitive aggression task was preceded by a visual presentation of alcoholic, but not nonalcoholic beverage, images. We concluded that alcohol‐related aggression scripts are not strongly developed in this age group, but individual differences in script strength are linked to alcohol‐related laboratory aggression.

Subsequently, highly identified group members are often less willing to offer reparations to the injured parties. Because appropriate emotional responses and reparations are critical to community reconciliation, the present investigation examined whether social identity complexity-the degree to which individuals perceive their multiple social identities as interrelated-reduced these defensive responses. In the aftermath of a campus riot, emotional responses and reparative attitudes of undergraduate students were assessed. Results indicated that individuals who closely identified with the university were in fact capable of experiencing guilt and shame, but only if they also had complex social identities. A path model indicated that emotional responses, in turn, predicted willingness to provide reparations to the campus community. Accordingly, social identity complexity provides a new approach to understanding responses to ingroup-perpetrated violence.",

These tendencies were conceptualized in terms of four attributes: two attributes that represent response intention (decision and style) and two others that represent motivations for that intention (putting one's partner in his or her place and avoiding conflict). These attributes were measured in the context of five hypothetical situations. Each of those scenarios involved potential escalation of intimate conflict, following an intimate partner's aggressive verbal demand. The study involved a convenience sample of 403 male and female participants. The findings show that, in the initial steps of intimate-conflict development, women tend toward escalation more than men. The findings also show that the escalatory tendency, as conceptualized and measured using the examined scenarios, corresponds to actual behavior exhibited in the resolution of common issues in the couples' lives. These findings reinforce gender motivation theory.",

    "abstract": "Although it is well known that adolescent delinquent behavior is related to poor outcomes in adulthood, longitudinal research on specific acts of delinquency and their interplay with important individual characteristics in predicting future outcomes is scarce. We aimed to examine how physical fighting-one of the most common acts of violent delinquency among adolescent boys-is related to adult life success in several domains, and how intelligence influences these associations. The study used data from 1,083 boys that participated in the population-based longitudinal Young in Norway Study, following adolescents from 1992 to 2015, by combining self-reports at four time points with comprehensive information from registers. Results showed that adolescent boys' physical fighting was associated with poor adult outcomes in the domains of employment, education, and criminal behavior. Associations remained significant even after controlling for conduct problems in general-which isolated the effects of fighting from other delinquent acts-as well as from a variety of other potential confounders. Detailed analyses on the interplay of physical fighting and intelligence showed that some parts of the associations between adolescent boys' fighting and several adverse adult outcomes could be ascribed to lower intelligence among the fighters. Moreover, intelligence moderated the relationship between physical fighting and adult education. Adolescent fighting was not related to educational attainment among boys with high intelligence, whereas boys with lower intelligence experienced detrimental effects of adolescent fighting. The analyses show the importance of considering adolescent boys' physical fighting as a potential risk factor for future social marginalization.",

However, few adolescent relationship aggression (ARA) studies have objective measures of violent neighborhoods. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of youth, this study examines the association between ARA and local levels of violent crime (measured using geocoded Uniform Crime Report data from each of the youths’ residential neighborhoods). Study analyses are based on survey data from 723 youth (ages 10–18) in current or recent dating relationships (351 males and 372 females) in the Survey on Teen Relationships and Intimate Violence (STRiV), a national representative household panel survey exploring interpersonal violence and related aggression among adolescents. About 19% of the sample reported ARA victimization in their most recent dating relationship (ARA perpetration was 17%). Neighborhood violent crime in the study (males living in 86.9 and females 99.8) was slightly lower than the national average of 100. With a broad national sample, 40% non‐Whites, hypotheses guided by theories of neighborhood influence were tested. The study did not find an association between neighborhood violent crime and ARA victimization and perpetration, controlling for key demographic factors. The results, for a broad range of high‐ and low‐crime neighborhoods, suggest that neighborhood violence does not seem to affect individual rates of ARA. The results suggest the ARA victimization and perpetration are perhaps ubiquitous and found both in low and high violent crime neighborhoods, suggesting that addressing local violent crime rates alone does not seem to be a path to also reducing ARA.",

Addtionally, self‐reported aggression was highest among adolescents who endorsed high levels of CU traits, psychopathy‐linked narcissism, and internalizing problems. The same pattern of results was not evident for other forms of narcissism.

The Cyber-Aggression Typology Questionnaire (CATQ; Runions et al., 2017, Aggress Behav, 43(1), pp. 74-84) overcomes this weakness by identifying four types of cyber-aggression (impulsive-aversive/rage, controlled-aversive/revenge, controlled-appetitive/reward, and impulsive-appetitive/recreation cyber-aggression). However, the CATQ only considers aggression in cyberspace. We extended the CATQ to the face-to-face context by developing a corresponding Face-to-Face Aggression Typology Questionnaire (FATQ). The aim of this study was to investigate factorial and convergent validity and metric measurement invariance between four-factorial cyber and face-to-face aggression. In total, 587 students from six Austrian universities filled out the CATQ, the FATQ, and additional scales during regular university lectures to examine convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the four-factor structure of both questionnaires, after excluding inconclusive items from the impulsive-aversive/rage subscale of the FATQ. These items were also removed from the CATQ to obtain two symmetric questionnaires. Metric measurement invariance between the CATQ and the FATQ was confirmed. Convergent validity was largely observed. Our results support an extended four-factor model of aggression. Having two parallel questionnaires, the FATQ and CATQ, enables future studies to investigate commonalities and differences in underlying drivers of aggressive behavior in the cyber and face-to-face contexts.",

We examined homophobic bullying victimization trajectories among high school students ( N = 3,064; M age = 13.67; Girls = 50.2%) and how these developmental pathways vary as a function of factors like homophobic bullying perpetration, sex assigned at birth, and sexuality. Using data from a 3‐wave longitudinal investigation over a 2‐year period, we utilized latent growth mixture modeling to explore the aforementioned trajectories. Findings suggested that there were three distinct classes characterized by high initial rates and declines over time, low initial rates, and increases over time, and low, stable, rate across time. Furthermore, results indicated that homophobic bullying perpetration, sex assigned at birth, and sexuality all predicted class membership.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Social–emotional factors associated with youth aggression have largely been studied in the context of social information‐processing models. The ability to accurately encode and appropriately interpret others' emotions has yet to be fully examined in the context of aggressive behavior, particularly during adolescence. Using cross‐sectional data from a sample of 282 at‐risk early adolescents, the present study examined associations between teacher‐reported aggression and youth performance on a task assessing two components of affective theory of mind: emotion recognition and situational attribution. Results indicated that emotion recognition, but not situational attribution accuracy, was significantly associated with teacher‐reported aggressive behavior. Over‐recognizing anger and under‐recognizing sadness were unique error patterns associated with aggression, and these associations remained significant after controlling for demographics and other key social information‐processing variables. Findings suggest that difficulties with emotion processing play an important role in the social information‐processing patterns observed in the context of youth aggression. Implications for preventive interventions for youth at risk of engaging in aggressive behavior are discussed.",

The study used the fifth and sixth wave of data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study ( n = 2595; mean age = 9.26 at wave five) for the analysis. Multivariate models show that youth ADHD, physically and psychologically abusive parenting, peer victimization, and community cohesion were important predictors of youth antisocial behaviors. Furthermore, youth ADHD diagnosis moderated some associations between the ecological factors and antisocial behaviors, suggesting that youth with and without ADHD may respond to some ecological contexts differently regarding the concerning behaviors. The findings imply that interventions targeting youth antisocial behaviors should involve collaboration across systems and coordination across programs to tackle a multilayered ecological context, especially when youth with ADHD are involved.",

Four hundred and six full-time female university students from four universities in Ukraine participated in the study. We found that emotional distress, parent-to-parent, and parent-to-child violence mediated the link between financial strain and intimate partner violence perpetrated by women on men. However, we found limited support for the moderating role of acceptability of intimate partner violence and violence-related laws and regulations in the relationship between individual and familial factors on intimate partner violence.

    "abstract": "During the cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s, many expressed fears that children with intrauterine cocaine exposure (IUCE) would grow up to be unusually violent. The present study examines the relationship of caregiver reports of school‐age children's aggressive behavior with IUCE and postnatal exposure to violence. Respondents were 140 low‐income, primarily African American children, ages 8–11, and each child's current primary caregiver from a longitudinal study evaluating potential long term sequelae of IUCE. Multiple regression analyses were used to investigate the independent and interactive effects of level of IUCE ( None ( n = 69), Lighter ( n = 47), Heavier ( n = 24)) and exposure to violence (Violence Exposure Scale for Children‐Revised) on aggressive behavior (Child Behavior Checklist), while also controlling for other intrauterine substance exposures and additional contextual factors. Children's self‐reported exposure to violence was significantly positively associated with caregivers’ reports of aggressive behavior ( β = 2.17, P = .05), as was concurrent caregiver's psychiatric distress ( β = .15, P = .003). However, neither IUCE nor its interaction with exposure to violence showed a significant association with aggressive behavior. Findings suggest the importance of postnatal social environment rather than IUCE in predicting aggressive behavior in childhood. Aggr. Behav. 42:209–221, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

A community sample of 600 young respondents (Serbs, Bosniaks, and Albanians, aged 18–30) was recruited within a multiethnic region of Serbia that experienced armed conflict during the break‐up of the former Yugoslavia. The best‐fitted SEM model, incorporating measurement and structural relationships between the variables, showed that the latent factor of Closed‐mindedness predicted all three aspects of MEM as well as Neighborhood Grudge, that is, resentment toward neighboring ethnicities. The effects of Disintegration and Death Anxiety on MEM were entirely mediated by Closed‐mindedness. Compared to previous findings, Closed‐mindedness appears to represent the most important set of cognitive and motivational tendencies that channel protracted intergroup tensions into militant extremism.",

Multilevel analyses showed that a higher perception of punitive practices and higher academic performance were associated with a higher perception of an inclusive, democratic, and peaceful school climate. The perception of a higher school‐level frequency of punishment was associated with a higher perception of an inclusive and democratic school climate.

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that reactive and proactive aggression likely have distinct underlying mechanisms that uniquely contribute to the perpetration of each as a result of faulty cognitive and emotional processes. Still, very little work has examined the association of the functions of relational aggression with emotion dysregulation and hostile attribution biases. In addition, it is important to examine relational aggression in its pure and co-occurring functions given that past work finds reactive and proactive aggression to occur both jointly and distinctly. Thus, the current study employed a bifactor model to distinguish between pure reactive, pure proactive, and co-occurring relational aggression in emerging adulthood (N = 647, Mage = 19.92, SD = 2.83), a developmental time period for which relational aggression is particularly prominent. To further address gaps in the relational aggression literature, indirect pathway models revealed that relational hostile attribution biases emerged as a concurrent indirect path in the relationship between emotion dysregulation and pure reactive relational aggression. Furthermore, emotion dysregulation was directly positively associated with both pure functions as well as co-occurring relational aggression, and hostile attribution biases for relational provocations were directly associated with both pure functions of relational aggression, though the association was negative for pure proactive and positive for pure reactive relational aggression. Findings highlight the potential influence of emotion dysregulation and attributing hostile intent to social situations on engaging in the different functions of relational aggression.",

Some previous theories and empirical studies have highlighted a moderated mediating model that normative beliefs about aggression (NBA) as a mediator and self‐control (SC) as a moderator for the link between EVM and aggressive behaviors (including bullying behaviors). However, most previous studies analyzed traditional bullying (TB) and cyberbullying (CB) separately, which is not conducive to finding the differences between the two bullying behaviors. Therefore, this study aims to compare the differences between risk prediction models of TB and CB among adolescents. A total of 777 Chinese adolescent students (336 girls; M age = 13.57 ± 0.98) completed questionnaires including EVM, NBA, TB, CB, and SC. The results showed that: (1) EVM was positively related to adolescent TB/CB; (2) NBA mediated the above relations; and (3) SC buffers the direct effect of EVM on TB and the effect of NBA on TB. However, SC buffers the effect of NBA on adolescent CB but not buffers the direct effect of EVM on CB. This study highlights the necessity of distinguishing offline and online situations in aggressive behavior research. We suggested “online disinhibit hypothesis” would be adopted to explain why protector factors (e.g., SC) do not buffer the link between aggression‐related risk factors (e.g., EVM) and online aggression (e.g., CB).",

For both gay men (N = 226) and lesbian women (N = 190) regression analysis showed that IS, HDLN, and especially HASSO proved to be important predictors for sexual aggression.

Lactating females were tested for their behavior toward intruder males during the time of postpartum estrus while housed in a two-cage apparatus containing a defensible nest area. Prior to being used as intruders, sexually naive males were screened for their behavior toward a newborn pup (83% exhibited infanticide). Only infanticidal males were then housed in pairs and allowed to establish a dominance hierarchy. Dominance status was further verified by a urine marking test. The dominant and subordinate infanticidal males were then placed into a lactating female's cage and observed for 1 hr. The test was terminated immediately when a male began to attack the pups. Lactating females attacked the males in both groups, but subordinate males received more intense attacks than dominant males. Dominant males elicited significantly more fear/defense behavior than subordinate intruders. All of the dominant males and only one submissive male attacked the pups. Females were thus successful in blocking infanticide only by infanticidal subordinate males. Since females do not persist in attacking males with high fighting ability, one function of maternal aggression could be to assess the fighting, and resource holding, potential of a future mate. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Although the anti-aggressive properties of neuroleptic drugs are well known, the effects of amisulpride on agonistic interactions have not been explored, and there are no studies comparing acute and subchronic effects of this compound on aggression in rodents. In this study, we examined the action of amisulpride (5–25 mg/kg, i.p), administered acutely or subchronically for 10 days, on agonistic behavior elicited by isolation in male mice. Individually housed mice were exposed to anosmic \"standard opponents\" 30 min after drug administration, and the encounters were videotaped and evaluated using an ethologically based analysis. After acute treatment, amisulpride (5–20 mg/kg) exhibited an ethopharmacological profile characterized by a marked decrease of offensive behaviors (threat and attack) without an impairment of motor activity. By contrast, the anti-aggressive action of the highest dose used (25 mg/kg) was accompanied by a weak increase of immobility. Body care was also significantly enhanced after treatment with the drug (20 and 25 mg/kg), emphasizing the involvement of dopaminergic receptors in this behavior. After subchronic treatment, no tolerance to amisulpride anti-aggressive activity was observed. Overall, this behavioral profile is similar to that observed by other atypical neuroleptics. Aggr.

Aggression was found to be positively correlated with friendly behavior at the dyadic level. It is demonstrated that children, like nonhuman primates, tend to reconcile within 1 min after the conflict. Victims tend to redirect aggression at other individuals. No effect of gender on reconciliation was found. The reconciliation tendency is less expressed in friends than in children who are not friends. A new reconciliation measure is introduced, and an operational definition of friendship is suggested. Aggr. Behav. 25:125–139, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the differences in social problem-solving strategies among parents of aggressive and non-aggressive boys. The subjects were the parents of 27 aggressive boys (27 mothers and 18 fathers) and of 28 non-aggressive boys (26 mothers and 20 fathers). Social problem-solving strategies were assessed from subject descriptions of six social problems arising in the daily lives of the adolescents. The results showed that the parents of both the non-aggressive and aggressive boys helped their sons to solve social problems, but the parents of the aggressive boys were more likely to be indifferent and punishment oriented. The role of the fathers was crucial. They were active in the families with non-aggressive boys, while the mothers were passive, but passive in the families with aggressive boys, while the mother had a supervising role. The solutions suggested by the fathers of the non-aggressive boys were more in number and focused on improving the social problem-solving skills of the son, i.e., the fathers discussed the problems, advised and helped their sons to solve them more than the fathers of the aggressive boys. It may be suggested that fathers' social problem-solving strategies and parental roles are of importance in the development of children's social behavior. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Recurring evidence suggests that social stress has anxiogenic-like effects in laboratory rodents. However, despite the fact that competitive situations are stressful, success in competitive situations reduces anxiety in humans. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether repeated experience of winning in aggressive encounters affects anxiety measures in laboratory rodents. Male rats were housed together with a female for 2 weeks. Cohabitation with females was necessary to induce high levels of aggressiveness in these animals. During the second week, half of the male rats were exposed daily for 30 min to an intruder of smaller size, and the other half remained undisturbed in their home cage. Group-housed male rats were also used as controls. Residents attacked and defeated intruders, who did not retaliate. After the fifth encounter, all animals were tested for anxiety on the elevated plus-maze. Repeated victory lowered anxiety measures considerably, despite the fact that aggressive encounters are stressful even for the victor. It is concluded that repeated victory has an anxiolytic action in male rats. The similarities with human data suggest that repeated winning in rats can be used as a laboratory model for success-induced changes in human anxiety. Aggr.

Intruders did not avoid investigating nor marking over the odors of familiar resident males or other conspecifics.

Extrapolating from sociological research linking indices of legitimate aggression by state to statewide frequencies of rape, we have extended the investigation of legitimate aggression and coercive sexuality to the individual level. The specific purposes of this research were to index the breadth and level of endorsement of legitimized aggression at the individual level and to measure the association between such an index and coercive sexual behavior. These purposes were achieved across the course of three studies in which we created a new dispositional measure, the Proclivity for Legitimized Aggression Questionnaire (PLAQ), and replicated a sociocultural level correlation with coercive sexual behavior (Study 1); assessed the individual differences level construct validity of the PLAQ (Study 2); and tested whether endorsement of items on the PLAQ were related to content-relevant behaviors (Study 3). The PLAQ was internally consistent, modestly but significantly correlated with a measure of self-reported coercive sexual behavior, and characterized by promising construct validity. Aggr.

The present paper examines the biochemical energetics of social cohabitation in groups of Macropodus opercularis. The species is closely related to Betta splendens, however, dominants use somewhat different behavioral tactics against intruders. In contrast to Bettas, submissive Macropoduses are not harassed by dominants, but are confined to the bottom of the tank. This results in a reduced rate of oxygen consumption in defeated animals (Anabantid fish mainly use atmospheric oxygen). The only metabolic change, compared to isolated controls, is a reduction in hepatic glycogen content. Submissive animals have shifted carbohydrate metabolism towards anaerobic glycolysis. Substantial reductions in muscle proteins, lipids, and glycogen occurred in submissive Betta splendens. Thus, the sharp difference in behavioral strategy results in a sharp difference in the energetic consequences of aggression. A theory is presented regarding the possible role of energetic constraints in the control of behavior. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The dopamine levels in the striatum as well as the nucleus accumbens with the tuberculum olfactorium were significantly lower in domesticated rats than in their wild counterparts. A substantial decrease was found in homovanillic acid level in the n. accumbens and tuberculum olfactorium. Specific binding of [3H]spiperone which labels D-2 dopamine receptors was higher in the mesolimbic structure of tame rats, whereas binding of [3H]SCH 23390 (D-1 receptors) was unchanged in this area. No substantial differences were detected in D-1 and D-2 binding in striatum. Apomorphine (0.3 mg/kg) elicited less locomotion in tame animals, reflecting a decrease of sensitivity of postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Tame rats showed fewer aggressive contacts in a foot-shock test than wild rats and the D-2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (25 mg/kg) significantly decreased the foot-shock aggression only in wild rats. Therefore, domestication, which diminishes defensive behavior and emotional reactivity of animals, is associated with decreases of dopamine level in the striatum, changed metabolism of dopamine in mesolimbic system, and an alteration in density and senstivity of D-2 receptors.",

Despite the key importance of progesterone in the inhibition of aggression, little is known of the mechanisms through which progesterone may exert this effect. Three experiments were performed to assess the degree to which metabolites of progesterone can affect aggression in female Syrian hamsters. Systemic estradiol treatment followed by injections of either progesterone (300 μg IP) or 4‐pregnen‐21‐ol‐3,20‐dione (DOC, 300 μg IP) reliably inhibited aggression. Systemic injection (75, 150, or 300 μg IP) of either 5α‐pregnan‐3α,21‐diol‐20‐one (THDOC) or 5α‐pregnan‐3α‐ol‐20‐one (3α,5α‐THP) did not affect aggression. Intracerebroventricular infusion of 3α,5α‐THP following systemic estradiol treatment also did not affect aggression. In a third experiment, female hamsters were given systemic treatments with estradiol and progesterone that were subthreshold with respect to inhibition of aggression. In these females, intracerebroventricular infusion of THDOC inhibited aggression. These results indicate that metabolites of progesterone can inhibit aggression, most notably in synergy with progesterone itself. Aggr. Behav. 27:372–381, 2001. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Extreme groups of type A and type B college-age males were each subdivided into two groups receiving different sets of instructions before the start of the task. One of the sets of instructions informed the subject that the given task would serve to evaluate his teaching abilities (evaluation condition). The other set of instructions was limited to giving the subject a description of the procedure of the task (nonevaluation condition). No significant main effects were obtained in the aggression responses of type A vs. type B subjects across the two instruction conditions, but a significant interaction for the baseline set of trials was observed between the behavior patterns (type A vs. type B) and the type of instructions given (evaluations vs. nonevaluation) for the intensity of the aggression response. Under evaluation instructions, type As showed greater intensity values in their aggression responses than type Bs under the same condition and greater intensity values than type As under nonevaluation instructions. In contrast, type Bs showed a greater intensity in their aggression responses under nonevaluation instructions than under evaluation instructions. Results were discussed in terms of the self-appraisal hypothesis of Strube et al. (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 52:956–974, 1987) of the nature of type A behavior.",

    "abstract": "Within the framework of modern evolutionary theory, arguments are reviewed that the nonlegal equivalent of aggressive criminal behavior may have evolved by natural selection among mammals, particularly primates, as part of their overall approach to reproduction. If so, the commission of aggressive crimes (or their nonlegal equivalent) by humans, and even efforts to prevent fellow social group members from being victimized by aggressive crimes, may also be partially explainable in natural selection terms. The plausibility of this deduction was explored, first, by specifying the three elements that a human act must have to be regarded as an aggressive crime. Summarily, these were that (1) injury to a victim must be a likely result of the act, (2) the act must be intended, and (3) the act must elicit negative responses from those witnessing it. The primate behavior literature was examined for evidence that some behavior of nonhumans met all three conditions. Affirmative results were obtained. Therefore, while further research is in order, human aggressive criminal behavior, as well as human efforts to control it, seem to have close parallels in other primates. This would be consistent with the notion that aggressive criminal behavior (along with its condemnation by fellow group members) is part of a social system produced and sustained by natural selection.",

Neural levels of 5-HT or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and subsequent aggression by the predator did not change to any great degree after ingestion of a single meal. Abundance of natural mink food for 3 days was associated with an increased level of 5-HIAA in the lateral hypothalamus and the amygdala as well as with an increased latency to attack and to kill rats. 5-HT seems to represent an endogenous factor that inhibits predatory attack by the mink; this effect appears to function through increased metabolism of 5-HT in some brain regions, which is evident after abundant intake of tryptophan with the natural diet.",

While it remains difficult to ascribe a single biologically significant role to CA at this time, this may at least in part reflect measurement considerations, problems in the widely varying experimental models, pharmacologic side effects, and failures to categorically distinguish the differing contributions of individual CA systems in the control of predation. The potential role of such factors in determining the outcome of an experiment are reviewed and possible functional contributions of CA systems are suggested.",

    "abstract": "The current study explored the perceptions of staff and patients concerning how patient-to-patient bullying should be defined and what behaviours it should include. Participants were randomly selected from the Personality Disorder Unit of a maximum secure hospital. A total of sixty interviews were conducted (30 staff and 30 patients). Problems in attempting to utilise definitions of bullying developed for use in other contexts, i.e., schools, were identified. Patients and staff presented with similar views about how it should be defined: both felt that aggression did not have to be repeated or severe in order to be classed as bullying, that bullying could be accidental, that the power imbalance between perpetrator and victim was not always explicit and, finally, that victims could provoke bullies unintentionally. Indirect (i.e. covert) forms of aggression were less likely to be considered bullying than direct (i.e. overt) forms. A number of differences were found between staff and patients regarding how bullying was conceptualised. Staff were more likely than patients to hold the belief that some patients liked being bullied, and appeared to acknowledge a broader definition of bullying than patients, accounting for a wider range of aggressive behaviours. A number of similarities between the current study and previous prison-based research were found. The implications of these findings for current research and the value in attending to prison-based research are highlighted. Aggr. Behav. 00:000–000, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The hypothesis was not supported and, at an individual level, there was no association between cultural orientation and beliefs about aggression. Asians showed higher I beliefs about their aggression than did Anglo-Saxons, and the typical sex differences in I and E beliefs were more pronounced in the Asian than the Anglo-Saxon sample. The study also assessed the relationship between I and E beliefs and instrumental and expressive personality traits in the two cultures. Moderate associations were found between I and E beliefs and the corresponding instrumental and expressive personality traits, which were unrelated to measures of cultural orientation. These findings show that despite superficial similarities in measures of cultural orientation, beliefs about aggression, and gender stereotypic traits, they are relatively unrelated constructs. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent studies suggest that acute administration of 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), an amphetamine derivative popularly known as “ecstasy,” produces an antiaggressive effect in male mice. However, there is no evidence with respect to the development of tolerance or sensitization after its subchronic or intermittent administration. In this study, we examined the action of low to moderate doses of MDMA (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p), administered acutely, subchronically (for 7 days) or intermittently, on agonistic behavior elicited by isolation in male mice. Individually housed mice were exposed to anosmic “standard opponents” 30 minutes after the drug administration, and the encounters were videotaped and evaluated using an ethologically based analysis. Acute treatment with MDMA provoked a significant reduction of aggressive behaviors, without altering immobility. However, this action was only selective at 1.25 mg/kg. With the intermediate (2.5 mg/kg) and the highest doses (5 mg/kg) of the drug, it was observed a significant decrease of offensive behaviors, accompanied by an increase of exploration from a distance, avoidance/flee and defense/submission behaviors. This ethopharmacological profile could indicate the existence of an anxiogenic‐like effect of MDMA. The overall picture of the effects of MDMA was very similar in the acutely, intermittently and daily treated animals. No tolerance or sensitization to the actions of the drug was developed after its repeated or intermittent administration.",

The mice were tested both in a “standard opponent”-type situation and in a similar test using a hormonally primed receptive female, after being gonadectomized and maintained with testosterone propionate as adults. Neonatal treatment with this compound had little effect on subsequent fighting behavior in either sex, but clear evidence was produced that this treatment masculinized the sexual behavioral potentialities of the females, an effect which was apparent in animals which had been injected on either day 1 or day 20 of life. Indications were obtained that females treated neonatally with cyproterone acetate were capable of differentiating between the male and female “opponents” in a manner similar to the male. The effects of this treatment on fighting behavior consequently appear to be dissimilar to the effects of neonatal castration in this species. However, the effects on mounting behavior in the females, evidenced in adulthood, seem Likely to be a consequence of the weak androgenic properties of the antiandrogen. The administration of cyproterone acetate neonatally appears to have a more dramatic effect on the adult weights of endocrine organs in females than in mates.",

The experimental procedure was to introduce a strange animal into the pen (“home”) of another rabbit and to record the occurrence of the following forms of behaviour: approach, sniffing, following and chasing, aggression. Altogether 290 rabbits of the following age classes were used - 16 to 30, 31 to 60, 61 to 90, and 91 to 120 days old, and adult females and males The young rabbits were members of 62 separate litters Thirty tests were carried out for each of 21 age-class combinations giving a total of 630 separate tests each lasting 10 minutes. The data collected were subjected to statistical analysis using a multivariate parametric approach to paired comparisons The multiple discriminant analysis was used. The results indicated the preparedness of even the youngest rabbits to defend their own territory and the inhibiting effect of strange territory on all rabbits, except the 61–90-day-old subjects referred to as adolescents. The adolescents displayed aggression to younger as well as older rabbits. Within their own age group even a few days seniority of the introduced individual levelled the intensity of aggression of contestants. This behavioural characteristic was not present in the oldest age class (91–120 days old). The results are discussed in relation to information on the behaviour of free-living rabbits. The innate nature of territoriality of the species is emphasised.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study addressed the question of whether there are gender and age differences in aggressive behavior when it is studied as the spontaneous expression of mental contents and not as the result of immediate social interaction. This study also investigated whether aggression, in terms of mental content, is related to temperamental aspects. Aggressive behaviors were examined in make‐believe play, in relation to age, gender, and temperament in a near‐ecological context, i.e., the Dolls' House Play. The participants, 55 boys and 47 girls, subdivided into three age levels (4 years–4 years and 6 months; 5–6 years; and 7 years and 6 months–8 years and 6 months) were requested to represent what happens in their family 1) during Mealtimes; 2) at Bedtime; 3) on the Saddest day; and 4) the Happiest day; their Dolls' House Play was then recorded. Children's temperaments were measured with the TABC‐Teachers' form [Martin, The Temperament Assessment Battery for Children , Brandon, VT: Clinical Psychology Publishing, 1998]. Data analysis was conducted considering aggressive behaviors in their distinct expressions—physical, verbal, direct, and indirect. Results revealed no statistical differences between boys and girls when all aggressive behaviors were compounded. However, when the distinct types of aggressiveness were considered, boys presented statistically higher levels of physical aggression than girls did. Moreover, boys and girls reacted with different types of aggression in the different emotional contexts created by the four episodes. Few age differences were observed. Surprisingly, there was a significantly greater presence of indirect verbal aggressiveness in younger children. With respect to temperament, a higher level of negative emotivity was significantly linked to a greater degree of aggressive behaviors in some of the episodes. In conclusion, this paper confirms gender differences in the type of aggressive behavior children display even in the absence of any immediate social interaction, which might itself trigger aggression.

    "abstract": "Abstract Attitudes of young people in the United States of America (n=145), Great Britain (n=177) and Western Australia (n=219), towards the possession and use of firearms were explored. These were measured on an Attitudes Toward Gun Scale [Branscombe et al., 1991 “A three factor scale of attitudes towards guns,” Aggr. Behav. 17:261], with particular reference to its three underlying dimensions ( rights, causes crime, and protects from crime ). Findings on these three dimensions of the ATGS indicate American respondents to be in greatest favour of gun possession, scoring significantly higher than Australian and British respondents in the belief that it is a citizen's right to own a gun, and that guns provide protection from crime. Australian and British respondents scored higher on items referring to the belief that guns stimulate crime . An additional item added to the scale by Cooke and Puddifoot [2000] concerning the right to carry concealed weapons gained little support from British, Australian, or American respondents. This, together with low mean scores by respondents from all nations on protection , questions the introduction of ‘gun‐carry’ laws in many states throughout the USA. Discussion centres upon the implications of such findings, and the usefulness for future research of a measure designed to explore why people own guns, choose to carry weapons, and keep guns in the home.

Behav. 27:430–445]. The recording of the electrocardiogram was conducted in a sample of 109 children (61 boys and 48 girls) while they completed the PAM. Across the conditions of controlled aggression, the simulated attack and defence evoked a mean increase of HR by 2.7 beats per minute (bpm), but the variation between children was substantial (−10.9 to+11.4 bpm). Children who showed a strong HR increase, moderate HR increase, or HR decrease were compared on heart rate variability (HRV) and intensity of (defensive) reactive aggression. Variation of mean HR reactivity was generally related to changes in parasympathetic activity since the power of HRV changed in the high (0.15–0.40 Hz) rather than the low (0.04–0.15 Hz) frequency band. The correspondence between the intensity of offensive and defensive aggression was weakest among those children who displayed either a strong increase or a decrease of HR as compared to those children who exhibited only moderate increase of mean HR. The stronger the children displayed an increase of HR during the PAM, the lower they were rated on the teacher rating scales for depressive symptoms, social anxiety, and aggression. Together, these results suggest that the relationship between the intensity of physical provocations and reactive aggression was moderated by dispositional negative emotionality and its regulation.

    "abstract": "Exposure of an aggressor to the suffering of his/her victim generally inhibits subsequent attacks [e.g. Baron, 1971a] presumably because of an empathic process. Physically abusive parents and individuals at high risk for child physical abuse are thought to present a deficit in empathy [e.g. Milner, Halsey and Fultz, 1995]. The present research was designed to investigate whether high-risk, compared to low-risk, subjects for child physical abuse select more aggressive responses and aggress with more intensity toward a supposed child whose behavior is adequate, inadequate or ambiguous in the presence of the child's pain cues. A second objective was to explore whether high-risk, compared to low-risk, subjects for child physical abuse fail to adequately integrate mitigating information and, therefore, do not inhibit their aggressive behavior following the receipt of mitigating information before or during an inadequate child behavior. Participants were engaged in an experimental task that involved attempting to teach a child how to proceed accurately through a computer-displayed maze and were given the opportunity to send positive (pleasant sounds and happy faces) and negative feedback (mad faces and unpleasant sounds) to the child. Two hundred and fifty undergraduate students participated in the experiment. A 2 × 5 factorial design based on two levels of the participant's risk status (high, low) and five conditions based on the child's behavior and the introduction of mitigating information was employed. As expected, low-risk, compared to high-risk, subjects showed less aggression when mitigating information was provided. Aggr. Behav. 32:1–15, 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Children who overestimated their network centrality compared to peer‐reports were less likely to be nominated by peers as overtly or relationally aggressive. Results run counter to threatened egotism theory, and instead support a resource control theory explanation of perceptual bias and aggression. Specifically, aggressive children may strategically limit the number of peers they report “hanging out with” to maintain social status within their peer group.

    "abstract": "The central aim of this article is to investigate the relationship between prevolitional processes and aggressive behavior. More specifically, the role of the goal underlying aggressive behavior was examined. A model of attitude, the Extended Model of Goal-directed Behavior, was tested with structural equation models to analyze the process that leads to the verbally aggressive behavior of calling someone names. Results showed that Goal Desire was a significant predictor but its relation to behavior is indirect, through desire toward and intention of calling someone names. Moreover, the results indicated that the positive emotions one anticipates if successful in calling someone names and the control one has over calling someone names play a significant role in the desire to call someone names. The discussion emphasizes the necessity of considering prevolitional processes when studying deliberative processes involved in the emergence of aggressive behavior.",

    "abstract": "People tend to respond to rejection and attack with aggression. The present research examined the modulation role of attachment patterns on provoked aggression following punishment and proposed an executive functioning account of attachment patterns’ modulating influence based on the General Aggression Model. Attachment style was measured using the Experiences in Close Relationships inventory. Experiments 1a and b and 2 adopted a social rejection task and assessed subsequent unprovoked and provoked aggression with different attachment patterns. Moreover, Experiment 1b and 2 used a Stroop task to examine whether differences in provoked aggression by attachment patterns are due to the amount of executive functioning following social rejection, or after unprovoked punishment, or even before social rejection. Anxiously attached participants displayed significant more provoked aggression than securely and avoidantly attached participants in provoked aggression following unprovoked punishment in Experiments 1 and 2. Meanwhile, subsequent Stroop tests indicated anxiously attached participants experienced more executive functioning depletion after social rejection and unprovoked aggression. The present findings support the General Aggression Model and suggest that provoked aggression is predicted by attachment patterns in the context of social rejection; different provoked aggression may depend on the degree of executive functioning that individuals preserved in aggressive situations. The current study contributes to our understanding of the importance of the role of attachment patterns in modulating aggressive behavior accompanying unfair social encounters.",

In contrast, violent first‐person shooter (FPS) video games reward players for headshots. The head is the smallest lethal target, and requires careful aim to hit. In this experiment, participants were randomly assigned to play a violent FPS game with humanoid targets that rewarded headshots, a nonviolent shooting game that punished hits to bull's‐eye targets with faces, or a nonviolent non‐shooting game. After gameplay, participants shot 16 “bullets” from a realistic gun at a life‐sized human‐shaped mannequin. Participants were told to hit the mannequin with as many bullets as possible, but they were not told where to aim. Consistent with operant conditioning theory, participants who played a violent FPS game that rewarded headshots had the most hits to the mannequin's head. Participants whose favorite video games were violent shooting games also had the most hits to the mannequin's head. These findings suggest that FPS games that reward headshots can influence people to aim for the head with a realistic gun after the game is turned off, even though the head is a much smaller target to hit and they are much less likely to hit another body part if they miss. FPS games are often used to train soldiers and police officers, but these findings suggest that such games might train individuals to hit the wrong part of the body.",

To study the origins of these aggression subtypes and their relation to anxiety, we tested if both subtypes can be distinguished in a nonhuman primate species, characterized their occurrence within the study group, and examined the link between aggression subtype and anxiety. Data were collected on 29 individuals of a semi‐free ranging group of Barbary macaques ( Macaca sylvanus ) at Affenberg Salem, Germany, via focal animal (303 hr) and event sampling (1,222 agonistic events). Using a priori definitions, each aggressive event was classified as either reactive or proactive. We found both aggression types in our study population as well as individual differences in the proportion at which they occurred. The predominant use of one subtype of aggression was linked to the individual's dominance rank, age and sex, but not related to standard behavioral and physiological measures of anxiety. Our results suggest that reactive and proactive subtypes of aggression also exist in Barbary macaques, indicating a deeper evolutionary history of these aggression types observed in humans.",

Tools measuring nonphysical \"controlling behaviors\" in relationships have therefore been developed to identify the latent construct of control. However, the underlying assumption that \"controlling behaviors\" form a distinct subset of IPA has not been validated. This study investigates the divergent validity of acts considered as \"controlling behaviors\" against other aggressive acts used in relationships. The IPA and relationship literatures were reviewed to identify 1,397 items involving \"controlling,\" physical, sexual, and psychologically aggressive acts perpetrated and/or experienced by an intimate partner. In total, 101 item pairs were identified and used to measure IPA tactics across these categories. In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis in a community sample (N = 561) found no evidence of a distinct factor of \"controlling behaviors.\" Behaviors labeled as \"controlling\" in existing measures were distributed across other factors, including \"eclectic aggression,\" \"direct psychological aggression,\" and \"monitoring acts.\" In Study 2A (N = 424 students), confirmatory factor analysis replicated the results of Study 1 and established configural measurement invariance (Study 2B), indicating no evidence for psychometric differences between samples. These results indicate that behaviors described as \"controlling\" in existing measures were not statistically distinguishable from other forms of IPA, and suggest that future research should investigate motivational, rather than behavioral, differences in the use of IPA. The findings challenge research to confirm whether a set of discrete behaviors can be used to accurately identify control in relationships and question the validity of tools that adopt this methodology.",

Aggression was also found to be combined with humor most frequently in interactions among players attempting to form social relationships. This last finding is consistent with the hypothesis that combining humor (smiling and laughing) with what would otherwise be interpreted as aggressive behavior is a means of establishing trusting relationships between individuals.

    "abstract": "Studies designed to determine the respective roles of substance P, excitatory amino acids, and enkephalins in amygdaloid modulation of defensive rage behavior in the cat are presented. The basic design of these studies involved three stages. In stage I, cannula electrodes for stimulation and drug infusion were implanted into medial hypothalamic or midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) sites from which defensive rage behavior could be elicited. Then, a stimulating electrode was implanted into a site within the medial, basal, or central nuclear complex from which modulation of the defensive rage response could be obtained. Amygdaloid modulation of defensive rage was determined in the following manner: it employed the paradigm of dual stimulation in which comparisons were made of response latencies between alternate trials of dual (i. e., amygdala = medial hypothalamus [or PAG]) and single stimulation of the hypothalamus or PAG alone. Thus, stage I established the baseline level ofmodulation (i. e., facilitation or suppression of defensive rage) in the predrug stimulation period. In stage II, a selective or nonselective receptor antagonist for a given transmitter system was administered either peripherally or intracerebrally at the defensive rage site, after which time the same dual stimulation paradigm was then repeated over the ensuing 180 min postinjection period in order to determine the effects of drug delivery upon amygdaloid modulation of defensive rage. Stage III of the study took place at the completion of the pharmacological testing phase. The retrograde axonal tracer, Fluoro-Gold, was microinjected into the defensive rage site within the medial hypothalamus or PAG, and following a 6-14 day survival period, animals were sacrificed and brains were processed for histological and immunocytochemical analyses for the neurotransmitters noted above. This procedure thus permitted identification of cells within the amygdala which were labeled retrogradely and which were also immunostained positively for substance P, excitatory amino acids, or enkephalin. For studies involving substance P, defensive rage was elicited from the medial hypothalamus and for studies examining the roles of excitatory amino acids and enkephalin, defensive rage was elicited from the PAG. In the first study, facilitation of hypothalamically elicited defensive rage was obtained with dual stimulation of the medial nucleus of the amygdala. In separate experiments, the selective NK1 non-peptide antagonist, CP 96,345, was administered both peripherally as well as intracerebrally into the hypothalamic defensive rage sites in doses of 0.5-4.0 mg/kg (i. p.) and 0.5-2.5 nmol (i. c.). Following drug delivery, the facilitatory effects of medial amygdaloid stimulation were blocked in a dose- and time-dependent manner in which the effects were noted as early as 5 min postinjection. The maximum drug dose (4.0 mg/kg) employed for peripheral administration resulted in a 42% reduction in the facilitatory effects of the medical amygdala (P < 0.002). This drug, when microinjected directly into medial hypothalamic defensive rage sites at the maximum dose level of 2.5 nmol, resulted in an 84% reduction of the suppressive effects of amygdaloid stimulation (P < 0.5) at 5 min postinjection. In the next study, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, DL-α-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP-7), was administered either peripherally (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) or intracerebrally (0.2 and 2.0 nmol) into PAG defensive rage sites. Facilitation of defensive rage behavior, which was observed following dual stimulation of the basal amygdala and PAG, was significantly reduced by either route of drug administration in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At the maximum dose level of peripheral administration, AP-7 reduced amygdaloid facilitation of defensive rage by 63% (P < 0.001) for 60 min, postinjection. A smaller (i. e., 19%) but still significant (P < 0.05) reduction in facilitation was obtained following intracerebral administration of the drug. In a third study, the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone (27.5 nmol), infused directly into PAG defensive rage sites, totally blocked the suppressive effects of central amygdaloid stimulation for a period of 30 min (P < 0.05) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The anatomical phase of this study revealed the following relationships: 1) that large numbers of neurons projecting to the medial hypothalamus from the medial amygdala immunoreact positively for substance P; 2) that neurons projecting to the PAG from the basal complex of amygdala immunoreact positively for glutamate and aspartate; and 3) that neurons located within the central nucleus of the amygdala which project to the PAG immunoreact positively for met-enkephalin. Collectively, these observations provide new evidence which characterizes the likely neurotransmitters linked with specific amygdaloid pathways subserving the modulation of defensive rage behavior in the cat.",

    "abstract": "In previous studies we have shown that subordinate swordtail males (Xiphophorus helleri) direct more bites to their mirror image than dominants and, in confrontations with strange dominant males, approach the opponent more often during the pre-escalation period of fights. Consequently, we predicted that fights between two omega-males should escalate faster than fights between two alpha-males. Indeed, in omega-omega fights preescalation periods were shorter and biting rates were higher than in alpha-alpha fights before the fights escalated from the first retaliation bite onward. Another new observation was that in omega-alpha confrontations the first bite in the pre-escalation period was executed more often by the omega-male and there was also a tendency to bite more compared to the alpha-male in that stage of the encounters. We conclude that sub-ordinate males escalate faster and fight more offensively prior to escalation than do dominant males. The results cannot be explained by the \"social conditioning principle.\" On the ultimate level moderate costs of losing and high benefits of winning a fight, constraints on continued growth after maturing, short life-expectancy, and habitat saturation are probably factors promoting the offensive tactics of subordinate males. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

BALB/cJ mice isolated for 5–10 days, when tested in a familiar environment were more aggressive than mice from the BALB/cByJ strain. In the resident‐intruder paradigm, in which a resident BALB mouse was confronted with an intruder NIH Swiss mouse, the BALB/cByJ mice showed more social investigation in their home cage towards the intruders, but there were no significant differences between the two strains in the amounts of aggressive behavior exhibited. The results of these experiments suggest that there are some differences in the social behavior of the genetically related BALB/cJ and BALB/cByJ mice.

    "abstract": "Community college students rated brief segments of violence from films selected to represent a variety of approaches to the depiction of violence. Men and women differed substantially on these sequences, men seeing them as more enjoyable, amusing, realistic, and emotional. Men also showed less inclination to restrict showing of such sequences to children, on television, or by X-rating. While no sex differences appeared in ratings of suffering or overall appraisals of violence, women' enjoyment ratings declined precipitously for the films rated as depicting more suffering, while those of men did not. However, both men and women saw more violence in sequences emphasizing suffering of characters, even when this ran counter to actual physical damage depicted. For men, enjoyment of these violent media excerpts and self-reports of recent physical violence were essentially unrelated, while women showed highly significant positive relations for the two variables. These findings suggest that the dynamics of violence for men and women may be different enough to make differential analysis by sex an especially productive research tactic.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this series of studies was to provide a detailed description of aggression in hamsters during pregnancy, on the day of parturition, in the presence or absence of pups, and during the estrous cycle. In the initial experiment, intrasexual aggression was examined on days 1, 4, 6, 12, 13, and 15 of pregnancy and on the day of parturition. Measures of aggression during the 10 min home cage tests included the number of attacks, fights, chases, and intruder retreats. Aggression was low during early pregnancy, significantly increased between days 4–12, and steadily declined until day 15, when levels of aggression were as low as those occurring during early pregnancy and among cycling controls. Animals tested on the day of parturition were significantly more aggressive than animals tested 24 hr prepartum, animals in early pregnancy, and cycling control animals. The second experiment showed that the high levels of aggression occurring on the day of parturition were significantly decreased when pups were immediately removed at parturition and females were tested 6–8 hr later. The last experiment examined intrasexual aggression in female hamsters during the estrous cycle. Four different groups of animals corresponding to the 4 days of the cycle were tested. Although peak levels were reached on diestrus days 1 and 2 and low levels of aggression occurred during proestrus and vaginal estrus, no significant differences were found.",

The rankings for the number of bites of food from a restricted source, the number of displays, the order of attacks, and the number of attacks each showed a significant concordance from day to day. A significant concordance was also found between the rankings of the different parameters. These data show that a stable dominance order is formed when females are in small groups. The top-ranked fish engages in more mutual displays and single-fish displays with the second-ranked fish than with the bottom-ranked fish. Displays showed differences in duration dependent upon whether or not they resulted in an attack.

The blood corticoid levels of both high- and low-ranking males are also reduced to one third of initial levels by social isolation. The normal level of this hormone was, however, restored following a standard-opponent test only in the case of the high-ranking males; the corticoid levels of the low-ranking males remaining depressed.

Imipramine (20, 30, and 40 mg/kg) elicited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on predatory behavior. Fluoxetine (10 and 20 mg/kg) alone had a slight influence on locust-killing behavior but potentiated the action of the subthreshold dose of 5-HTP (25 mg/kg). Pretreatment with the blocker of 5-HT2 type receptors methysergide (2 mg/kg) abolished the inhibitory effect of 5-HTP. These finding indicate that serotonin of the brain exerts an inhibitory effect on predatory behavior in mice. In contrast, neither lesion of the dorsal raphe nucleus (although significantly depleting the brain serotonin) nor treatment with methysergide (2 mg/kg) induced locust-killing behavior in weakly aggressive DD mice. Low predatory aggressiveness in DD mice is suggested to be related to the low tonus of the mechanisms activating killing behavior rather than to excessive serotonergic inhibitory influences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Resource value and expected gain in reproduction may affect motivation to fight and the likelihood of winning. Previous experiments have showed that males increase their fighting effort when defending a territory that contains females. However, we hypothesized that for an intruding lizard, the value of a new territory may be lower if he already has a female in his own territory, and consequently, aggressivity should be lesser than if he has no access to any female. We staged encounters between males of the lizard Podarcis hispanicus in outdoor terraria to analyze the outcome and detailed behaviors involved in agonistic interactions in the presence or absence of a female in the terraria of resident and intruders. Our results showed that when a female was present, the level of aggressivity of the resident male was higher; the probability of winning the contest also increased, but only if the intruding male had no females in his own terraria. In contrast, when the intruding male was also the owner of another territory containing a female, residents were less aggressive. We suggest that the lack of information on the reproductive state of an unfamiliar female may be enough to decrease fighting motivation of an intruding male, if he has more expectations of success with his own familiar female. We conclude that differences in expected reproductive success with different females may help to decide the outcome of conflicts between males quicker and cheaper. Aggr.

Subjects presented their point of view on a case study in a three-person group discussion setting.

The occurrence and location (i.e. on the head, neck, body or tail) of bite wounds were recorded for adult and juvenile male and female voles. The greatest (33%) incidence of bite wounds were recorded on juvenile females and the lowest (18%) in adult females. Seasonal analysis of wound data in adults revealed that females were more likely to be bitten during the breeding season whereas bite patterns in males did not vary seasonally. Analysis of bite pattern topography revealed that most Water voles seemingly attempt to bite vulnerable target areas of the body (namely the head and tail). This is in contrast with studies on rats and mice where competitive forms of attack (particularly involving males) largely avoid these areas of the attacked animal's body. Targeting vulnerable areas is normally a characteristic of defensive modes of attack. Patterns of bite topography and agonistic behaviour in this species seem to reflect competitive interactions between individuals, particularly between territorial females and their female offspring, over access to essential resources.

The current study (a) developed measures of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) for sexual aggression (SA) and risky sex (RS); (b) characterized college men's PBS use; and (c) evaluated whether those who reported engaging in SA and RS showed lower PBS use. Undergraduate men from two universities ( n = 567) who endorsed sexual attraction toward women completed measures of PBS, SA, RS, rape‐supportive and sociosexual attitudes, and alcohol consumption. On average, participants reported using PBS for SA and RS fairly often, but a sizeable number indicated that they seldom or never used the strategies. Men who reported SA engagement in the last year, relative to their peers, endorsed sharply lower reliance on SA PBS and RS PBS. Men who reported at least one RS behavior in the last year used RS PBS far less often than their peers. The PBS measures converged as expected with other attitudinal and behavioral measures. The new PBS measures reference cognitive‐behavioral approaches that a large percentage of college men use on a regular basis, making them potentially acceptable prevention targets. Further, men at greater risk of exhibiting SA are much less likely to take steps to reduce the risks associated with sexual behavior, in comparison with their peers. Thus, future work could evaluate the potential usefulness of incorporating PBS for SA and RS into primary prevention programming in both domains.",

That is, few studies have examined dimensions of positive parenting behavior (e.g., positive reinforcement, involvement) as independent predictors of CP and even fewer have investigated their potential moderation by callous‐unemotional (CU) traits. A sample of 184 6–9 year‐old children with and without attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was followed prospectively for two years. Controlling for baseline ADHD diagnostic status, initial CP, and negative parenting (i.e., corporal punishment), we examined CU traits, positive reinforcement and involvement, and their interactions as predictors of two‐year change in CP. Positive reinforcement and CU traits independently predicted increased rule breaking behavior whereas parental involvement inversely predicted aggressive behavior. A significant positive reinforcement x CU traits interaction suggested that positive reinforcement predicted a decrease in aggressive behavior, but only in children with low CU traits; conversely, positively reinforcement marginally predicted increased aggressive behavior among children with high CU traits. No other significant parenting x CU traits interaction was observed. We consider these findings within a developmental psychopathology framework where interactive exchanges underlie the development of CP.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although childhood aggression is typically associated with peer rejection, some children concurrently employ coercive and socially skilled behavior and successfully avoid negative peer outcomes. However, research on children's dual use of coercive and social behavior has largely employed cross‐sectional designs with nonclinical populations and, as a result, little is known about the covariation of aggression with social skills, particularly among high‐risk samples. We directly addressed this limitation by testing childhood aggression and social skills as separate time‐varying predictors of prospective change in peer rejection in a sample of children with and without attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Two hundred and two 5–10‐year‐old children ( M = 7.9 years, SD = 1.2) with and without ADHD were followed prospectively for 6 years. Key constructs, including children's overt aggression, social skills, and peer rejection, were collected at each of the three waves using multiple methods and informants. Controlling for demographic factors and time‐varying ADHD symptoms, longitudinal change in child‐, parent‐, and teacher‐reported aggression positively predicted prospective change in parent‐ and teacher‐reported peer rejection. Importantly, predictions were moderated by parent‐ and teacher‐reported social skills, such that aggression inversely predicted peer rejection for children with high social skills. These results demonstrate that social skills meaningfully alter trajectories of peer rejection predicted from cross‐time variation in aggression. We discuss the theoretical and empirical implications of these findings within a developmental psychopathology framework, including recommendations for directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "This study explored relationships between self-reported emotion regulation difficulties, frequency of aggressive script rehearsal and aggressive behavior in 129 adult male inmates. Significant moderate positive correlations were found between the frequency of aggressive script rehearsal and (1) emotion regulation difficulties overall, as well as the following dimensions, (2) difficulties controlling impulses when experiencing negative emotions, and (3) confidence in the effectiveness of emotion regulation strategies. Significant weak positive correlations were found between the frequency of aggressive script rehearsal and two emotion regulation difficulty dimensions, (1) a lack of understanding of emotional responses, and (2) difficulties in dealing with goal directed behavior when experiencing uncomfortable emotions. No significant correlations were found between aggressive behavior and emotion regulation difficulties, except for a weak positive correlation between aggressive behavior and difficulties controlling impulses when experiencing negative emotions. Multivariate analyses were used to assess whether the frequency of aggressive script rehearsal moderated the effect of emotion regulation difficulties on aggressive behaviour. Significant improvement in the prediction of aggression resulted from consideration of the interaction between (1) aggressive script rehearsal and difficulties in emotional clarity, and (2) aggressive script rehearsal and awareness of emotional experience, even after accounting for the influence of age and attitudes toward violence. In conclusion, the results suggest that the rehearsal of aggressive scripts may function to regulate emotion, particularly amongst people who are inattentive to their emotions or who have difficulty understanding their emotional experiences.",

A critical examination of this allegedly differential effect shows it to be unsupported and unlikely to be replicable. Statistical power of the sample was so low that the nominally significant correlation coefficient with aggressive dominance and the nominally not significant one with sociable dominance actually did not differ significantly from each other. Apart from these data‐analytic and statistical power issues, a number of further substantive comments are raised, including conceptual and study design issues, 2D:4D measurement and reliability issues, and biased presentation (i.e. selective citation) of prior related research evidence. More generally, it is suggested that 2D:4D research would benefit from adopting publishing standards requiring discovery and replication samples (i.e. successful replication of novel findings by the initial researchers themselves), as is now increasingly required for publishing in various fields of inconsistent, hard‐to‐replicate evidence.

    "abstract": "In many species, young males are the dispersers, leaving their natal area after weaning to establish a breeding area of their own. As young males disperse, however, they are bound to encounter unfamiliar adult males with established territories. Such interactions between an adult male and a young male may always be agonistic. Alternatively, there may be an age threshold below which aggression is not elicited and above which the adult male is aggressive toward the juvenile male. To test these two alternative hypotheses, we paired 47 young Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) males ranging from 24 to 65 days of age with 47 adult male hamsters and measured aggressive and investigatory behavior for 5 min. We observed no aggression by the adult toward young males between 24 and 47 days of age or toward the single male that was 49 days of age. Young males that were 50 days of age or older, however, elicited significant levels of aggression from the adults. These results indicate that in Syrian hamsters, young males are less vulnerable to adult aggression up to an age threshold and are more vulnerable to adult aggression beyond that threshold. This pattern may facilitate the establishment of territories by dispersing young males below that age threshold.",

In this experiment, we used two independent manipulations to assess the role of violence in both selective exposure and enjoyment in order to examine the relationship between the two. Program descriptions for four prime‐time television dramas were altered to create violent and nonviolent descriptions for each episode. Then the episodes themselves were edited to create violent and nonviolent versions of each. Participants ( N = 191) were more likely to choose violent descriptions to watch, but enjoyed the nonviolent episodes more than the violent episodes. Moreover, the nonviolent episodes were rated as more enjoyable even when the participants had chosen to watch a violent program description. From a theoretical perspective, these results suggest the need to move beyond explaining the appeal of violence in terms of increased enjoyment and instead further explore other motivations that could be driving selective exposure to violent content.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Syrian hamsters are highly aggressive animals that reliably defend their home territory. After social defeat, however, hamsters no longer defend their home cage but instead display submissive and defensive behavior toward an intruder, a response that we have termed conditioned defeat. Plasma testosterone is significantly reduced in Syrian hamsters following repeated defeat suggesting that social defeat might also impair copulatory behavior. The present study aimed to determine whether copulatory behavior in male Syrian hamsters is suppressed following repeated social defeats and additionally whether exposure to a hormone‐primed stimulus female after social defeat reduces the behavioral response to defeat. Hamsters were paired with an aggressive opponent for one or nine defeats using a resident‐intruder model, while controls were placed into the empty cage of a resident aggressor. On the day after the last treatment, half of the hamsters were paired with a receptive female for 10 min. There were no significant differences in the copulatory behavior of defeated versus non‐defeated hamsters, and the opportunity to copulate had no effect on subsequent conditioned defeat testing, as defeated animals displayed significantly more submissive behavior than did non‐defeated animals. The current data suggest that conditioned defeat is not necessarily a maladaptive response to social stress, at least in terms of reproductive behavior, but may instead represent a viable behavioral strategy adopted by losing animals following social defeat. Further, these data indicate that conditioned defeat is relatively persistent and stable, as the opportunity to copulate does not reduce the subsequent display of submissive behavior. Aggr.

    "abstract": "The nightlife setting is a risk context for violence involvement that ultimately may cause severe injuries and fatalities. Few studies have examined associations between alcohol and illicit substance use with physical violence involvement among nightlife patrons. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relative role of demographics and substance use characteristics for nightlife violence involvement among Norwegian nightlife patrons. A cross‐sectional self‐completion survey was conducted outside 12 licensed premises in Oslo ( n = 1099, response rate = 76%) and each respondent's BAC level was measured by a breathalyzer and registered on the questionnaire. A total of 103 individuals (10%) reported that they had been involved in physical violence when they were consuming alcohol in the nightlife setting during the last 12 months. Uni‐variate results showed that patrons who had been involved in violence were more likely to present a BAC level above 1.00‰ than those who had not been involved. The prevalence of last year illicit substance use was overall high, especially in the violence‐involved group. The most important factors associated with violence involvement in multivariate analysis were a high frequency of last year alcohol intoxication and last year illicit substance use. Women and those with high education had a lower risk of violence involvement. The implications for preventive initiatives are that these need to focus on factors additional to alcohol restrictions. Preventive efforts targeted to specific patron groups and measures targeting patrons who are more likely to use illicit substances may hold promise. Aggr.

Children responded to instrumental and relational provocations and their parents read the same scenarios and responded the way they believed their child would. Peer nominations provided aggression scores. We explored how means differed by provocation type (relational vs. instrumental), informant (mother, father, and child), and gender of child. The results also suggest that parent perceptions may effectively predict children's participation in relational and physical aggression, above and beyond the child's self-reports.",

This study assessed whether (1) HD is stable over time; (2) the relationship between HD and positive, negative, disorganized, and excited symptoms is consistent over time; and (3) HD is related to aggression post-discharge. Two hundred psychiatric inpatients were recruited on admission to hospital; 41 were available for follow-up at 6 months post-discharge, including 29 men and 12 women, with an age range of 19-63 (M = 39.63 years, SD = 12.69 years). Psychiatric symptomatology and interpersonal style were assessed at recruitment and follow-up; aggression in the community post-discharge was measured at follow-up. Results showed that (1) HD was stable over time despite an overall reduction in psychiatric symptoms, (2) HD was positively correlated with symptom severity at both time points, and (3) higher HD, excited symptoms, and positive symptoms measured in the community, and more severe positive symptoms measured in hospital, were associated with aggressive behavior post-discharge. These results suggest that HD is a risk factor for more severe psychopathology. Furthermore, HD, positive symptoms, and excited symptoms measured in the community act as risk factors for aggressive behavior post-discharge. As such, treatment planning and risk assessment should consider HD. Aggr. Behav. 42:324-332, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Given their sensitivity to serotonin neurotransmission and unique association with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), we tested callous-unemotional (CU) traits and narcissism as separate mediators of the association of 5-HTTLPR with ADHD and ODD. We evaluated 209 5-9 year-old children with and without ADHD at baseline; approximately 2 years later (i.e., Wave 2), parents and teachers separately rated ADHD and ODD symptoms and youth self-reported antisocial behavior. Controlling for race-ethnicity and baseline ADHD/ODD, narcissism uniquely mediated predictions of multi-informant rated Wave 2 ADHD and ODD from variation in 5-HTTLPR; CU traits mediated predictions of Wave 2 ADHD from variations in 5-HTTLPR, but did not mediate the associations of 5-HTTLPR with ODD or youth self-reported antisocial behavior. Specifically, the number of 5-HTTLPR long alleles positively predicted CU traits and narcissism; narcissism was positively associated with Wave 2 ADHD and ODD symptoms, whereas CU traits were positively associated with Wave 2 ADHD. Child sex also moderated indirect effects of CU traits and narcissism, such that narcissism mediated predictions of ADHD/ODD in girls but not boys. Psychopathic traits may represent a relevant pathway underlying predictions of prospective change in ADHD and ODD from 5-HTTLPR, particularly in girls. We consider the role of psychopathic traits as a potential intermediate phenotype in genetically sensitive studies of child psychopathology. Aggr.

For instance, athletic target-shooters might classify guns as athletic rather than aggressive stimuli and thus should not be more aggressive than the general population. The present work investigated aggression and emotion-regulation in target-shooters. A longitudinal study found that initial self-reported aggression in target-shooters was higher than in the general population and further increased over 1 year. Additionally, the sample exhibited deficient emotion-regulation strategies, and this was related to self-reported aggression. In contrast, their implicit self-construct became more peaceful over time but was unrelated to all other measures. Two further cross-sectional experiments explored the causal impact of athletic target-shooting and other athletic activities (shooting a basketball) on aggression. Target-shooters and basketball players were tested before and after their regular team practice and aggressive thoughts and feelings were measured. Target-shooting but not basketball practice activated aggressive and anxiety-related thought more strongly than positive thought. Future research avenues, implications for the indirect measurement of aggression, and possible interventions to decrease aggression in target-shooters are discussed. Aggr.

This short-term (4 months) longitudinal study was designed to consider children's aggression as predicted by their inhibitory control (IC) and parents' experiences of poverty-related strain in an urban Head Start sample. At Time 1, parents reported on their family's economic situation (income, family size), education, vocational preparedness, and completed a measure of psychological economic strain; children (N = 90; Mage = 52.78 months) completed two IC tasks (Day/Night Stroop; Whisper). Four months later, parents completed the Preschool Proactive and Reactive Aggression survey, used to assess children's physical and relational aggression. Mediation analyses supported that physical and relational aggression were both fully mediated from parents' vocational preparedness, though through different mechanisms. Physical aggression was mediated by parents' psychological economic strain. Relational aggression was mediated through children's IC. Findings support the proposal that aggression should be viewed within context and that typical assumptions about developmental patterns of physical aggression may not hold for all children.",

This study attempted to examine whether the newly proposed construct of interpersonal mindfulness, mindfulness as it happens within the interpersonal context, was connected to forgiveness and the mechanisms behind this connection. Data were collected from 312 participants using measures of interpersonal mindfulness, trait mindfulness, anger rumination, state anger, self-reported forgiveness, and forgiving behavior. Results showed that interpersonal mindfulness was significantly associated with both self-reported forgiveness and forgiving behavior even while accounting for trait mindfulness. Mediation analysis revealed that anger rumination and state anger could mediate this link separately and sequentially, but only when trait mindfulness was uncontrolled. When controlling for trait mindfulness, the mediating role of state anger remained significant, but neither anger rumination nor the serial combination did. An alternative model was also supported, showing that after controlling for interpersonal mindfulness, trait mindfulness was indirectly associated with forgiveness through anger rumination and the serial mediating effect of anger rumination and state anger, but not state anger. These findings suggest that interpersonal mindfulness is more suitable for predicting interpersonal forgiveness than trait mindfulness. State anger may operate as a proximal mechanism in explaining how mindfulness relates to interpersonal forgiveness, whereas anger rumination may operate at a more distal level.",

The present study applied a three‐step latent class analysis to identify the co‐occurrence patterns of childhood maltreatment and advantageous family conditions among 1379 Spanish adolescents. The study also sought to identify the sociodemographic risk markers and psychosocial adjustment associated with each latent class membership. The analyses revealed four classes, namely (1) violent family context, (2) emotionally neglectful family context, (3) adverse and advantageous family conditions, and (4) positive family context. Having a lower socioeconomic status and being a migrant were both risk markers for membership to the violent family context as well as to the adverse and advantageous family conditions class. Adolescents who were exposed to advantageous family conditions (e.g., the positive family context or the adverse and advantageous family conditions) exhibited fewer psychosocial problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, somatisation) and lower frequencies of teen dating violence (TDV) when compared with those in the violent family context. Moreover, membership to the emotionally neglectful family context class was related to more psychological symptoms and a higher prevalence of TDV when compared with membership to the positive family context class, despite the absence of IPVE and maltreatment. Overall, the results provide evidence that advantageous family conditions contribute to better psychosocial adjustment on the part of adolescents even when exposed to IPV and maltreatment. Identifying the experiences that contribute to adolescents' psychosocial adjustment could help clinical and governmental interventions tailor their often‐limited resources to children who are at greater risk of negative outcomes.",

There is a growing interest in measuring emotional decoding and empathic deficits in IPV perpetrators to better understand dropout and recidivism proneness, due to their direct impact on behavioral regulation. In the current study, we first aimed to examine whether the emotional decoding abilities of facial expressions and empathic abilities (cognitive and emotional), as well as their interrelationships in IPV perpetrators ( n = 561), would explain dropout, treatment attendance, and recidivism (risk and official) once treatment ended. Our results allowed us to conclude that emotional decoding abilities and perspective taking (cognitive empathy) were significantly and negatively associated with dropout and recidivism. Two moderation models were significant. On the one hand, participants with low emotional decoding abilities presented lower intervention doses the lower their perspective taking. Furthermore, the percentage of participants that reoffended was higher among individuals with low and moderate perspective taking who dropped out. Therefore, our study highlights the importance of conducting emotional decoding and empathic assessments during the initial stages of intervention programs to clearly outline the therapeutic needs of IPV perpetrators. This would allow designing coadjuvant and complementary training programs that can support the main interventions by increasing treatment adherence and, in turn, reducing the risk of recidivism.",

The Aggression Expectancy Questionnaire displays a four-factor structure, as well as evidence of convergent and divergent validity with self-reported aggression and relevant basic (e.g., antagonism, anger) and complex (e.g., psychopathy) personality variables. It is posited that this type of cognitive mechanism may serve as an intermediary link between distal characterological predictors of aggression and its proximal manifestation, which is in line with several prominent theories of personality and may ultimately hold clinical utility by providing a framework for aggression interventions.",

A paucity of research has tested these learning tenets, and no research that we are aware of has examined the moderating role of sex. The current study used a two-wave longitudinal design with US youth. Participants completed measures of cyberbullying attitudes and perpetration. Results showed that early cyberbullying attitudes and behavior predicted later cyberbullying attitudes and behavior; however, and most importantly, sex moderated those relationships. Males had stronger longitudinal relationships than females. Results are interpreted regarding theory.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that a lower second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), which is a sexually dimorphic trait and the indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure, may be associated with aggressive behaviors. In this cross-sectional, case-control study, we investigated: (1) Are the aggression and impulsivity levels and emotional problems higher? (2) Is the 2D:4D ratio lower in adolescents and young adults who presented with a fifth metacarpal neck fracture (boxer's fracture) compared to controls? (3) Is the digit ratio correlated with aggressive measures in individuals with a fifth metacarpal neck fracture? Seventy-one consecutive patients presented with a fifth metacarpal neck fracture within the age range of 11-25 years old comprised the study group. The control group consisted of 71 age and sex-matched subjects without a history of aggression-related injury. The aggression, impulsiveness, and psychosocial well-being were measured by self-reported questionnaires. 2D:4D was measured by conventional radiography. The 2D:4D ratio was similar between groups, however, when the analyses were conducted separately for sex, females in the study group showed lower 2D:4D than females in the control group (p = 0.001). The aggression level of the study group, measured by the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire was higher than the control group (p = 0.014). The impulsiveness scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 were similar (p = 0.60) and the total difficulty score on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was higher in the study group (p = 0.009). A lower 2D:4D ratio significantly predicted verbal and total aggression scores (p = 0.036, p = 0.032, respectively). Our findings suggest that females with a history of aggression-related injury have lower 2D:4D, and a lower 2D:4D is correlated with higher aggression levels in both sexes. Understanding and addressing aggression in these patients may help prevent further self-inflicted injuries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Love withdrawal is a form of interpersonal manipulation that shares many features with relational aggression; its use by children has not been examined. Guided by social learning theory, we sought to investigate the prevalence of toddlers' use of love withdrawal toward caregivers (parents and teachers) and further investigate how this behavior was associated with relational and physical aggression and parents' use of love withdrawal. These aims were examined using parent and teacher reports in a sample of 198 toddlers ( M age = 33.62 months; SD = 5.00 months; 50.5% girls). We found that most toddlers used love withdrawal directed at parents (79.2%) and teachers (72.1%) when angry and displayed this type of behavior more than relational and physical aggression. Accounting for household income, hours per week in childcare, and child age in months, as well as classroom clustering, we found that relational aggression, and not physical aggression, predicted the use of love withdrawal by toddlers (teacher reports), and that the associations were stronger for love withdrawal and relational aggression than for physical aggression. We also found that parents' use of love withdrawal toward their child was correlated with their reports of their child's use of love withdrawal, but not with their child's use of aggression. These results highlight the importance of considering the use of love withdrawal by children given its association with aggression which is linked to poorer psychosocial functioning.",

Lower attentional control or inhibitory control is considered to predict more aggressive behaviors, while few studies have documented the possible predictive effects of aggressive behaviors on attentional control or inhibitory control. The present study examined the bidirectional relations between aggressive behaviors and both inhibitory control and attentional control in 169 Chinese primary school children (75 girls, M age = 7.15, SD age = 0.33), annually for 3 years starting at age 7. The No‐go accuracy on a Go/No‐go task was used as the index of inhibitory control, and the intraindividual reaction time variability (IIRTV) of correct Go trials indicated attentional control. The aggressive behaviors subscale of the child behavior checklist–Chinese version was used to assess the children's aggressive behaviors. The results demonstrated a significant and stable predictive effect of previous aggressive behaviors on subsequent attentional control, with more aggressive behaviors predicting greater IIRTV at both the between‐child and within‐child levels. No significant effects of inhibitory control or attentional control on aggressive behaviors or sex‐specific patterns were found. The findings suggest the negative impact of childhood aggressive behaviors on attentional control and underscore the importance of early prevention and intervention for childhood aggressive behaviors.",

Mothers reported the participants' mistrust during childhood and preadolescence on items from the Child Behavior Checklist. Aggression was assessed by standardized self‐report measures at each age period. It was found that mistrust was associated with aggression during preadolescence and predicted changes in aggression to mid‐adolescence and adulthood. The findings supported the conclusion that mistrust during preadolescence predisposes individuals to show aggression later in the life course.",

The behavior of mice was videotaped on days 1, 3, and 5 of five consecutive daily encounters (10 min each; isolation days 55, 57, and 59). Ozone exposure caused an abatement of aggressive behavior and enhanced fear-associated displays shown by a significant decrease in the frequency of attacking and digging and an increase in freezing. Moreover, O3 induced a decrease of time spent in attacking and exploration/activity. Nonexposed animals exhibited a day-dependent increase in self-grooming frequency which was not observed in O3 mice; by contrast, freezing was higher in O3 mice on day 5 of the test. Data suggest that O3 exposure produces a remarkable reduction of mouse aggression, indirectly confirming previous findings on physical and neurobehavioral effects of O3. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, 119 high school boys and 79 institutionalized delinquent boys of the same age range were assessed on their own aggressive behavior and on their tendencies to attribute social failure to controllable, external, stable causes, anticipate a hostile affective response, and endorse aggressive behavioral responses to by pothetical social situations. While the two populations of boys did not differ detectably in their attributional tendencies, the relations between an individual's aggressiveness and an individual's attributions differed considerably across the two populations. In particular, among deliquent but not among delinquent but not among nondelinquent boys, the tendency to attribute one's social failures to stable and controllable causes predicted stronger hostile emotional responses to failure and a tendency to endorse physically aggressive responses following such failure. These hostile emotional responses to failure and this preference for a physically aggressive response, in turn, predicted greater actual aggression within the population of delinquent boys. Neither of these links could be demonstrated for nondelinquent boys. However, in the nondelinquent sample, attributing social failure to external and controllable causes predicted endorsement of aggressive responses only indirectly through increased hostile affect. It was concluded that the specific relations between cognitive and affective responses to social failure may be a contributing factor to the serious physical aggression displayed by some delinquents and to the less serious aggression of nondelinquents. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The analysis results in the following proposal for a definition of the concept of human aggression. Human aggression is characterized—at least from the point of view of the person affected or a neutral judge—as an inconsiderate or malicious violation of a norm which implies current or potential harm by a person actively responsible; characterizing the violation of the norm as “inconsiderate” or “malicious” implies that no arguments for exoneration (e.g., excuses or justifications) will be accepted. These six constitutive elements of the concept of human aggression are discussed; in particular, the structure of possible arguments for incrimination and exoneration is outlined in detail. Finally, some consequences for future research are drawn from this suggestion for the definition of human aggression.",

Gonadectomized male and female CPB-S3 (Tryon Maze Dull) rats were treated with testosterone propionate (TP, 250 μg) or vehicle and subjected to tests in which they became either winners or losers. S3 males and females were tested against Long Evans rats to become losers or against Wistar rats to become winners. Subsequently, S3 winners were tested against losers. In addition, winners and losers were tested against naive S3 opponents of the same sex. After varied agonistic experiences, all animals were tested for social preference in a situation in which they could choose between their respective opponents without the possibility of social interaction. Thereafter, they were also exposed to a two-choice passive avoidance learning procedure to see if the behavioral effects of aggressive interactions generalized to nonsocial learning. Males and females reacted differently to winning or losing, the presence of testosterone being a critical factor in the manifestation of this sex difference. Relatively permanent effects on aggressive and other behaviors were only established in TP-treated males. Losing experiences in the social-preference test generally led to a slight preference for naive, less aggressive animals. Testosterone-treated male losers, the group expected to be most vulnerable to generalized inhibition and impairment of learning, did not differ from other categories in the two-choice passive avoidance procedure, although marked differences were observed between the sexes and between testosterone and oil-treated animals.",

It was thought that, whereas the classic interpersonal experimental situation confounds the effects of the stimulus presented and several interpersonal processes, speed of fist clenching in a noninterpersonal setting could constitute a valid measure of the subject's readiness to fight. Twenty‐four male and 24 female students (ages &gt; 20 and &lt;36 years) were instructed to press with their right hand a device commanding the projection of slides upon reception of an acoustic signal. Speed of clenching of the hand was recorded in the four conditions generated by the combination of two levels of acoustic signal (aversive and nonaversive) and two modalities of slides (firearms or tools). The results show that the reception of aversive sound accelerates fist clenching. Simultaneous presentation of slides of firearms and reception of aversive noise increases the speed of clenching of the fist. The slides' main effect was not significant. More irritable subjects tend to execute this movement faster than their less irritable counterparts, and more emotionally susceptible subjects tend to be slower than less susceptible ones. Male subjects were faster than females. This pattern of results is discussed in relation to the hypothesis formulated by the authors.",

Dams easily established aggressive dominance over male cagemates soon after pairing, and their aggression was low thereafter for the duration of pregnancy and lactation. The aggression of dams with females, on the other hand, tended to fluctuate with highs during mid pregnancy and mid lactation and lows around birth. When dam aggression was low around birth, female cagemates frequently became aggressively dominant, and several dams lost their litters. The higher aggression of dams toward females than males is probably a reflection of greater intrasexual competition for environmental resources that includes pups.",

Also as predicted, power and outcome were found to have no effects on judgments for observers having a neutral perspective. Based on these findings, the extent to which intergroup aggression is perceived as justified is explained in terms of motivational biases theorized to maintain positive social identity.",

Aggression was almost always initiated by the gilts, and neither bulbectomy nor pheromone treatment of the boars reduced its occurrence. The results suggest that the display of aggression by gilts towards boars of similar body size is unlikely to be suppressed by the steroidal pheromones present in boar saliva.",

Animals were distributed into three groups according to their attack latency in a pre‐screening test (high‐, moderate‐, and low‐ attacking mice) and each group received weekly injections of 60 or 120 mg/kg of testosterone or sesame oil for 10 weeks. Behavioral tests were then carried out. Afterwards, organs were weighed and blood samples collected in order to obtain hormonal data. Treatment had a differential impact on attack in the three groups of animals. Only the high‐attacking testosterone‐treated mice showed lower total duration of attack than their controls. Those that received 60 mg/kg spent more time exhibiting exploratory behaviors. As an index of the anabolic activity of the drug, all testosterone‐treated mice had heavier kidneys and, as an index of the androgenic activity of testosterone propionate, they had heavier seminal vesicles, lighter testes, and showed higher testosterone levels in a dose‐dependent way than their controls. Hence, the effect of treatment on peripheral physiological parameters was similar in all three groups whereas behavioral effects differed depending on basal aggressiveness, considered a characteristic of coping style.

Morning urinary concentrations of T metabolites (measured by immunoreactive 5α–androstane–17α–ol–3–one) were used to reflect T status. Results show that first, no correlation of T metabolite levels with any of the aggressive behaviors was found between individuals. Within an individual, T metabolite levels only correlated with a minority of aggressive behaviors. Hence, social factors are likely of major importance for the occurrence of aggression in this highly gregarious species, but certain intraindividual aspects of aggressive behavior are nevertheless related to T. A more detailed discussion of the results follows. Secondly, all correlations with T were similar for every individual, males and females, suggesting an analogous relationship in both sexes. Thirdly, our study confirms for bonobos that the measure of aggression used, the time scale at which the correlation is studied, and whether this is done on an inter‐ or intraindividual level, considerably affect results.

Priming had an influence on judgments of injustice and on anticipated fury, but no effect whatsoever on aggression (measured as the decrease in well‐being wished for the perpetrator). The type of relationship had an effect only on anticipated disappointment. The main effects of motive were found on aggression and on the anticipated feeling of the perpetrator after the act.

    "abstract": "Abstract Alpha‐2 adrenoceptors (α 2 ‐ARs) are critically involved in regulating neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerves and neurons and play an important role in the regulation of awareness, arousal and vigilance. In our recent study, dexmedetomidine, a full α 2 ‐AR agonist, produced antiaggressive effects in the social conflict test in mice at doses that were twice smaller than those producing sedation. The aim of this study was to ascertain antiaggressive effect of a novel drug naphthylmedetomidine, with a more selective α 2 ‐AR activity. Behavioral effects of naphthylmedetomidine (150–1200 µg/kg i.p.) were studied in the activity cage and in the social conflict tests in mice. Naphthylmedetomidine dose dependently decreased aggressive behavior during social conflict in aggressive mice with significant reduction already at the lowest doses tested (150 µg/kg), whereas locomotion and social investigation were significantly decreased only after four times bigger dose of naphthylmedetomidine (600 µg/kg) in aggressive mice. Naphthylmedetomidine had no effect on aggression in nonaggressive mice. Naphthylmedetomidine reduced locomotion in the activity cage significantly only at the highest doses tested (600 and 1200 µg/kg), and this effect was only partially reversed by administration of high doses of an alpha‐2 antagonist atipamezole (3 and 10 mg/kg). In nonaggressive mice, the difference between the dose reducing dominant social behavior (social investigation) and locomotion (150 and 300 µg/kg, respectively) was smaller than in aggressive mice. In conclusion, naphthylmedetomidine showed a very strong and selective antiaggressive effect in aggressive mice, which was devoid of locomotion‐inhibiting/sedative effect. This study suggests that naphthylmedetomidine may have clinical potential as antiaggressive drug. Aggr. Behav. 34:394–403, 2008. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Participants were 119 undergraduate men. They completed a questionnaire that assessed trait disinhibition, were randomly assigned to a distraction or no‐distraction control condition, and completed a shock‐based aggression task in which they received low and high provocation from a fictitious opponent. A significant positive association between trait disinhibition and physical aggression was found among non‐distracted participants exposed to high, but not low, provocation. Distraction from provoking cues significantly attenuated this association. This study is among the first to provide experimental evidence of (a) the positive relation between trait disinhibition and laboratory‐based physical aggression, and (b) a potential method for attenuating this association.",

The current study used the Pathways to Desistance data set (n = 416) to examine the pathway of TBI to aggressive offending through adverse psychological effects. The findings of the structural equation model supported the hypothesized association. Specifically, increased exposure to TBI was indirectly associated with aggressive offending through adverse psychological effects. An additional supplemental analysis illustrated that a direct link between TBI and aggressive offending did not exist for the analytical sample.

Negative binomial regression models using data from 252 youth in residential placements found that several psychopathic features are significantly associated with violent video gaming. The role of psychopathy operated differently across gender and arrest chronicity, and across models remorselessness emerged as an important correlate. Given the desensitization that can occur with violent video game play, it is of particular concern among delinquent youth with psychopathic personality features.",

Here we examined the relationship between physical, psychological, and sexual violence with respect to influencing variables including mental health, risk-taking behaviors, and coping strategies. Data from 5385 men were collected as part of an epidemiological study on violence experience. A classification and regression tree analysis identified the main predictors of violence perpetration and classified violent offending into high- and low-risk groups. Results indicate that violence is best predicted by previous exposure to violence and polyvictimization. Physical violence is best predicted by prior exposure to physical violence and this is further influenced by the frequency of and the age at which violence was experienced. Drug use was a strong predictor of physical and psychological violence. The latter is best predicted by a history of polyvictimization, the severity and the originator of violence. Sexual violence is strongly predicted by one's sexual violence experience. Other factors such as demographic characteristics are less predictive. Our results may contribute to the development of early prevention and intervention approaches that account for different risk factors. The significance of violence exposure suggest that intervention measures must focus on victims of early and prolonged experience of violence. On the strength of the link between drug use and violence, exposure to violence should be considered in drug prevention and intervention and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated whether men with a history of real-life aggressive, dominant behavior show increases in testosterone and cortisol levels after brief social contact with women. Furthermore, we tested the prediction that such changes in hormones would be larger than those observed previously in young male students. Sixty-seven male participants convicted of intimate partner violence (IPV) either had brief social contact with a female confederate (experimental condition) or a male confederate (control condition). We also performed meta-analyses to investigate whether IPV perpetrators' hormonal responses were larger than the typical responses of young male students in prior studies. All statistical analyses were preregistered. Change in testosterone did not differ across experimental conditions, and testosterone in the IPV perpetrators actually declined from baseline in the female confederate condition. Our meta-analysis showed that this testosterone decrease was different from the testosterone increase typically observed in young male students. The cortisol levels of IPV perpetrators did not change in response to contact with women. This result was consistent with our meta-analysis since young male students also did not experience a cortisol change in response to interactions with women. In sum, our findings provide no evidence that male IPV perpetrators exhibit larger hormone increases to brief interactions with women, although it is possible that the men in this sample did not perceive the social contact period as a courtship opportunity. These results suggest that hormone reactivity to social encounters may differ across subject populations and depend on how subjects perceive social situations within laboratory settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Peer victimization (PV) is a serious concern for youth and is associated with subsequent suicide ideation in young adulthood. The interpersonal theory of suicide may provide a framework for understanding suicide ideation in this population. Specifically, thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB) have been significantly associated with suicide ideation among young adults with a history of peer victimization. Additionally, the personality trait of pessimism is associated with elevated suicide ideation. Thus, this study tested the association between self‐reported frequency of retrospective relational (i.e., verbal and indirect) PV in primary and secondary school, thwarted interpersonal needs (TB and PB), and current suicide ideation, as well as how these relations may vary based on current pessimism. Participants were 330 undergraduate students. Nonparametric bootstrap moderated mediation procedures were used to test hypotheses. Results indicated significant indirect effects of frequency of retrospective relational PV and suicide ideation through PB and TB. Contrary to predictions, results did not indicate significant moderated mediation; however, the association between PB and suicide ideation was stronger at lower pessimism levels. We also provide supplemental analysis with optimism as the moderator. These findings suggest that clinicians may consider targeting TB, PB, as well as pessimism and optimism among those with a history of relational PV when assessing and intervening on current suicide ideation. Implications, limitations, and future directions are further discussed.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory input into the brain can be disrupted by a variety of environmental factors, including exposure to pathogens or environmental contaminants. Olfactory cues are often eliminated in laboratory rats and mice through highly invasive procedures like olfactory bulbectomy, which may also disrupt accessory olfactory pathways and detection of non-volatile odors. In the present study, we tested whether inducing anosmia through intranasal infusion of zinc gluconate alters aggression in a monogamous, biparental rodent species, the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus). This less invasive method of manipulating olfaction selectively targets the olfactory epithelium and reduces the detection of volatile odors. Treatment with zinc gluconate extended the time required for male and female California mice to find hidden pieces of apple and reduced the amount of time spent investigating bedding that was soiled by unfamiliar males. Moreover, inhibition of olfaction with zinc gluconate reduced aggressiveness in both sexes as demonstrated by an increased attack latency in the resident-intruder test among same-sex dyads from the same treatment group. These results suggest that volatile olfactory cues are necessary for agonistic responses in both male and female California mice. Therefore, even in species with complex social systems that include territorial aggression and monogamy, volatile olfactory cues modulate agonistic behavior.",

    "abstract": "A 3 day long cohabitation in pairs of previously isolated adult male Betta splendens was studied. The first two mornings started with intense fighting, the frequency of which decreased during the day. The bursts of aggression noticed in the mornings were associated with a significant carbohydrate metabolism activation, while daytime activity resulted in a reduction of muscle proteins in the evenings. These changes were more pronounced in submissives than in dominants. The third day marked a shift in the behavior of the pairs: bursts of attack activity were not noticed, while the threatening display frequency increased. During this day a similar reduction in lipids was observed in dominants and submissives. While during the first 2 days the dominant position offered some metabolic advantage, this advantage disappeared during the third day when both members of the dyad seemed to do equally less well than their isolated counterparts. Combined with previous findings obtained in this series of experiments, the present results support the assumption that in this species the presence of one opponent is less well tolerated than the presence of four conspecifics. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "In a previous study we found that in the intraspecific, resident-intruder fights of males of two vole species there were significant differences in the frequency of use of some of the behavior patterns used for attack and defense. To determine whether the species differences were due to differences in the behavior of the attacker (resident), defender (intruder), or some combination of both, a detailed frame-by-frame analysis of videorecorded sequences was conducted. The analysis revealed that prairie vole resident males would switch their biting attacks from the rump to the head if the defender turned to face the attacker. As tactics involving the defender standing his ground to fend off the attacker proved to be ineffectual, the defender fled following every attack. In contrast, the montane vole resident males persisted in attacking the rump of the defender. Therefore, defending montane voles adopted defensive tactics that involved facing the attacker. This study draws attention to some of the descriptive issues involved in making cross-specific comparisons in fighting behavior. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

However, in this study of intraspecific fighting by male mice, it is shown that mice do indeed rotate to supine. This maneuver is used to evade or extricate themselves from bites to the lower dorsum by the attacking opponent. Once free from the bite the defender does not remain supine, but will immediately turn to prone and flee. Remaining motionless in the supine position may serve a submissive function in other species, but this does not seem to be the case for mice. The present findings illustrate that the supine tactic is a dynamic maneuver for defense of body areas targeted by the opponent. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

These hypotheses were examined in a 3 × 2 factorial experiment in which the amount of coercion allowable by a norm (Low Norm, High Norm, and No Information) and the level of coercion (Low or High) were manipulated. As predicted, aggressive reactions by subjects were inhibited when the provoker conformed to a low norm by using a low level of coercion. On the other hand, subjects retaliated by using a high level of coercion when the level of coercion used by a provoker violated the norm. Subjects who could justify their behavior by the availability of a high punitive norm tended to use all of the coercive power available to them even when the provoker used a low level of coercion. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Although there were no significant habitat differences in vegetation cover, distance from the edge of the colony, or nesting density, skimmers nesting in salt marshes were more aggressive toward the herring gull than were those nesting on the beach. Aggression increased during the first three minutes of the test, and decreased slightly thereafter. Aggression levels were highest when the gull moved compared to when it was stationary. Skimmers made few responses when a person was present with the gull, but aggression increased dramatically when only the gull remained. Our results suggest skimmers may engage in more aggressive behavior in defense of their nests than previously thought, particularly when exposed to a predator that actually takes eggs and chicks. Further, we suggest that conclusions about antipredator behavior drawn only from studies of interactions with people may need further amplification. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

To determine the effects of gender-specific social experience three different types of groups were constituted after the animals had been weaned. The subjects were randomly assigned to different treatments. Female groups were composed of one experimental male and three female cohabitants. Male groups were composed of five experimental males each, and the mixed-sex groups were composed of two experimental males and of two females. The experimental subjects stayed in these groups until the age of approximately three months, when the testing for sexual and aggressive behavior commenced. For the sexuality tests, a receptive female was placed in the home cage of the experimental male for ten minutes. A nonaggressive male was placed in the home cage of the experimental male for seven minutes for the aggression tests. The experimental males were administered both sexuality and aggression tests, the sequence of testing sexual and aggressive behavior was systematically varied in order to control the influence of the two different types of behavioral tests. The results showed that males with only male social experiences showed fewer responses and were less active in both the aggression and sexuality tests than the males from the two other types of groups. Significant positive correlations between activity during aggression and sexual tests were obtained for all three groups. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Proper assessment of aggressive behavior is essential for an understanding of its causes. In 1987, Palmstierna and Wistedt [Acta Psychiatr Scand 76:657-663] introduced the Staff Observation Aggression Scale (SOAS), an instrument for monitoring the frequency, nature, and severity of aggressive incidents. In the present study, the validity of the SOAS severity scoring system was examined, and the severity scores were refined. The SOAS was used to record aggression on six closed wards of three psychiatric hospitals. The SOAS severity scores of 556 aggressive incidents were compared with severity estimates given on Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) by staff members. The original SOAS scores were found to be moderately correlated with the estimates of severity given by staff on the VAS. The SOAS severity scoring system was refined on the basis of the staff severity estimates. The revised scoring method and other refinements in the contents of the instrument led to the construction of the SOAS-R. The SOAS-R seems to be a promising tool for monitoring a wide range of (self-) destructive acts on psychiatric wards. Aggr. Behav. 25:197–209, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Sister and nonsister paired females that gave birth simultaneously (n = 18), or at least within 7 days from each other (n = 12), were tested for maternal aggression on post partum day 7, or 10 days after the first delivery, respectively. Sister (n = 14) and nonsister pairs (n = 16) did not differ in cumulative values of post partum aggression or in the extent to which aggression was balanced within the pair. The aggressive behavior of each female was not correlated with her relative proportion of pups in the litter. Rather, the combined scores of aggression within the pairs were found to be positively correlated with the cumulative litter size. The analysis of mouse litter defence behavior shows that, under conditions of communal nesting, kinship does not seem to affect parental investment in the young significantly. Rather, the cumulative litter size could be used by paired females as a major indicator for parental investment allocation.",

Body temperature, weight, and locomotor activity were monitored immediately before and 8 and 24 hr after injection. Twenty-four hours after injection, social behaviors were assessed in a 10-min dyadic test, and hypothalamus, spleen, and serum were collected. In both lines, endotoxin treatment increased behavioral immobility (\"freezing\") and decreased social exploration. Other effects showed line differences: Males from the high-aggressive line had a lower threshold to endotoxin-induced effects on body temperature, weight loss, spleen weight, and corticosterone. Social reactivity (startle response to mild social investigation) increased in the high-aggressive line and decreased in the low-aggressive line after treatment. In the high-aggressive line only, endotoxin decreased attack frequency and increased latency to attack. The interactions between selected line (genotype) and endotoxin treatment (environment) demonstrate that genetic-developmental differences in social and aggressive behavior may indicate the extent to which immune stimuli (e.g., bacteria, viruses, cytokines) function as \"biobehavioral stressors.\" Aggr.

A 2 × 2 design was employed with \"Victim of attack\" as the first factor (no attack vs. attack) and \"Behaviour toward a third person\" as the second factor (no attack vs. attack). The main dependent variable was the number of attacks by the victim toward the attacker (retaliation). Thirty-two students took part in the experiment. Victims of attack retaliated more against the attacker than those who suffered from no attack. Victims of a personalistic attack retaliated more than victims of an undistinctive attack. The results, confirming both hypotheses, support an attributional view on harm-doing and contradict the notion of retaliation as pure behavioral reciprocity. Aggr.

    "abstract": "In our database of 331 parental narratives of tantrums had by children 18–60 months old, 29% of the tantrums were followed by child-initiated affiliation with parents. Four variables increased the probability of children's post tantrum affiliation (PTA): age, prolonged screaming, physiological stress, and parent-initiated separation from the child during the tantrum. The age effect may be due to increasing post tantrum persistence of negative affect, to the emergence of shame, guilt, and embarrassment over this developmental period, and/or to increasing cognitive ability, empathic capacity, or socialization. Screaming, which may be analogous to the defensive vocalizations of nonhuman primates, increases PTA when prolonged for 6 min or more. Physiological stress (indicated by autonomic activation or respiratory distress) appears linked to prolonged screaming and may mediate its effects by increasing the child's dysphoria and need for consolation. Separation (parents' departure from the scene of the tantrum or their imposition of a time out) also appears linked to prolonged screaming and may reflect parents' response to an aversive auditory stimulus. There was no evidence that PTA was associated with the presence or degree of physically expressed anger in the tantrum. PTA may be associated with distress during the tantrum. The post conflict reconciliation which occurs in several domains of human social life may be first experienced by children in the aftermath of their tantrums. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Agonistic encounters of all three species of the vocalizing genus Trichopsis were observed in order to compare species-specific fighting strategies and the specific investment in acoustics. Additionally, these encounters were compared to agonistic encounters of Macropodus opercularis which was considered to be mute. The aim of this comparison was to investigate if mute fishes stress visual or tactile displays. Within the genus Trichopsis, significant differences among the three species were found in qualitative and quantitative analysis of displays. Frontal display occurred only in Trichopsis vittata, whereas a strong tail-beating while vocalizing was only observed in Trichopsis pumila. Fight duration and the number of sounds and circlings were highest in Trichopsis schalleri. The largest relative distances between circling opponents occurred in T. pumila, the smallest species. Also, the number of attacks was lowest in T. pumila. Fighting assessment seemed to be different in each species. For the first time, sound production has been reported for Macropodus opercularis (infrequently and with extreme low sound pressure levels), but much more investment in visual and tactile displays has been demonstrated. Lowering the branchiostegal membrane and spreading the opercula occurred only in M. opercularis and was never observed in any of the Trichopsis species. The number of attacks was higher in Macropodus than in any Trichopsis species. The relative distance between Macropodus opponents while circling was closest compared to the three Trichopsis species. Visual and contact displays are reduced in extensively vocalizing fish species, like Trichopsis sp., compared to mute or seldom vocalizing species, like Macropodus. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Individually housed male mice confronted anosmic “standard opponents” in a neutral arena 10 min after drug administration. Encounters were videotaped and evaluated using an ethologically based analysis facilitating estimation of time allocated to 11 broad behavioral categories. Nicotine did not have significant effects on threat or attack but significantly diminished time allocated to digging. The lowest dose of lobeline significantly diminished attack and induced a slight increase of immobility without significantly diminishing other behaviors with motor components. The intermediate and highest dose of lobeline reduced time allocated to all behaviors with motor components. It is concluded that these two nicotinic agonists produce different behavioral profiles during agonistic encounters in mice but that this test may not facilitate assessing the impact of such drugs on irritability.

This behavior was used as a potential taxonomic tool for gaining a better understanding of the phyletic relationships among the species within the group. No overt aggression was recorded toward members of the same species. To examine interspecific relationships, F. polyctena was first confronted with F. cunicularia, to ascertain its aggressiveness toward a distantly related species. All such encounters led immediately to overt and prolonged attacks with virtually no initial mutual inspection. This suggests that recognition of strangeness of the unrelated species is almost immediate in F. polyctena, as previously observed in F. lugubris and F. rufa toward the same antagonist. Subsequently, F. polyctena was contrasted with F. lugubris and F. rufa (also belonging to the F. rufa group) in order to compare these related species. Fierce attacks accompanied by all the elements of conflict behavior were observed in all encounters. Moreover, the degree of aggression in the field was higher than in laboratory-paired ants, possibly because of a territorial effect. These data and our previous and similar research indicate that the relationships between F. lugubris and F. rufa are closer than between these two species and F. polyctena. In considering different viewpoints on this problem, the validity of the aggression test is discussed and the opportunity to compare levels of aggressiveness among strictly sympatric samples of red wood ant species gathered from the same ecological environment are considered.",

The vast majority stated that a nuclear war could not be won and that they expected to die in the event of war. About three fourths in both communities seldom discuss nuclear issues with anyone including their own children, and only one fourth of the U.S sample and about one half of the Finnish sample have ever done anything personally to oppose the arms race. About one half of the Americans and three fourths of the Finns said that the United States was not doing everything possible to prevent nuclear war, and many in both groups favored disarmament. Males in both groups were more likely to believe that nuclear war is winable and survivable. “Survivalists” and “activists” differed on many key questions. Other issues are discussed, particularly with reference to numerous recent studies concerning nuclear attitudes. Also discussed is the issue of advocacy research and the role of the behavioral sciences in dealing with the nuclear threat.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have investigated strategies that a participant in dyadic aggression may use to reduce the aggression of the other participant. In one set of these studies the subject is instigated to aggression by an opponent who sets maximum shocks for the subject to receive during the first block of six trials. Following attack-instigation, opponents shift to withdrawal and matching strategies for 18 trials. The withdrawal strategy is an abrupt shift to the lowest levels of shock possible. The matching strategy is the exact matching by an opponent of the shock set by the subject on the previous trial. With these procedures the withdrawal strategy has been the most effective method to reduce aggression. These results led to the suggestion that the effectiveness of the withdrawal strategy may be due to immediate, unambiguous communication by the opponent of his willingness to reduce attack. This hypothesis was tested in the present study by creating a matching condition modified to include immediate, unambiguous communication of willingness to reduce attack. In this withdrawal-matching condition the opponent followed attack with two trials of the lowest levels of shock before shifting to a matching strategy. Although the withdrawal-matching strategy did not lead to shock settings that were significantly lower than the matching strategy, there was evidence that subjects interacting with withdrawal-matching opponents did reduce their shock settings from block 1 to block 4 more rapidly than subjects interacting with matching opponents. A variable matching strategy was also used to provide a more realistic analogy of matching in the mundane world. While subjects with variable-matching opponents also did not set shock levels during blocks 2, 3, and 4 that were significantly lower than the matching strategy, there was evidence that subjects in this condition reduced their shock levels more rapidly than subjects with matching opponents. Although the effects were not as strong as expected, the results do provide some support for the interpretation that the effectiveness of the withdrawal strategy may be due to unambiguous communication of willingness by the opponent to reduce his or her aggression. The effectiveness of the variable-matching strategy was attributed to interrupting the tendency of the subject and his or her opponent to match each other's responses. Consistent with earlier attack-instigated aggression studies, the withdrawal strategy in the present study led to a rapid reduction in aggression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Principles of conspecific defense have been analyzed for rodents, in which specific target sites for biting by attackers on defenders serve as an important determinant of the actions involved in both attacker and defender behavior. In an effort to determine the generality of these principles, attack and defensive behaviors and target sites for biting attack were evaluated in a nonrodent species, the tree shrew ( Tupaia belangeri ). Brief daily and repeated conspecific dyadic encounters between adult, socially experienced males (dominants, attackers), and adult, socially naive males (subordinates, defenders) that had been transferred into the territory of the dominants, produced a polarization of attack and defense. The dominant males showed chase, chase attack, jump attack, and biting behaviors, while the subordinates displayed flight and freezing. The vast majority of bites, as well as wounds and bruises, were on the subordinates’ backs. These patterns are very similar to those previously found in rats and mice and suggest that the organization of fighting, with targets of biting (or other painful) attack serving as an important determinant of both attacker (dominant) and defender (subordinate) behavior, may show considerable generality across nonrodent as well as rodent species. Although relatively few wounds were found after 28 days of repeated and daily encounters, the subordinate tree shrews show a variety of behavioral, neuroendocrine, and central nervous changes, indicating that they are stressed by these encounters per se.

Our method is a cross‐sectional household survey of violence amongst a random sample (n=3007) of the general population between the ages of 15 and 60. In this population the more severe forms of aggression tend to appear concurrently with the less severe forms. Multivariate analyses of the data show that a family history of crime, physical aggression among family members, lack of clarity of parental norms, beliefs justifying the use of violence, and alcohol consumption are the main correlates of verbal and physical aggression independent of age, gender and social class. Although the findings are limited by the cross‐sectional design, exclusion of the institutionalized population, and reliance on retrospective self‐reports, they provide population‐based estimates of different forms of aggression and support for known correlates of aggression in a Latin American context.

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reports tests of the factor structure of the original and Revised Expagg scales using a confirmatory factor analytic approach. Current evidence regarding the dimensionality of the Expagg scale [Campbell A et al. 1992. Aggr Behav 18:95–108] proposes that the scale measures a single bipolar instrumental‐expressive social representation of aggression factor. In contrast, evidence on the Revised Expagg scale [Archer J and Haigh AM. 1997. Brit J Soc Psychol 36:83–105] suggests two unidimensional factors of instrumental and expressive aggressive beliefs. Furthermore, Campbell et al. [1999. Aggr Behav 25:435–444] claim that there is equal evidence for the Revised Expagg being either one‐ or two‐dimensional. They also suggest a short modified version of the Revised Expagg. Current evidence, however, is based on traditional and flawed exploratory factor analytic methods of scale assessment. This paper addresses the limitations of the previous psychometric assessment of these measures by implementing confirmatory factor analytic methods in the assessment of construct validity. It thereby evaluates the previous claims regarding the factor structure of these measures. The results suggest that none of the a priori specifications of the Expagg and Revised Expagg adequately explain the sample data. The results are discussed in terms of the significance of demonstrating sufficient construct validity of measurement instruments in psychological research.Aggr.

    "abstract": "The paper suggests that there are specific features of violence, both personal and organized that have roots in the cultural formation of the Central American peoples. Its focus is on the three neighboring countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador and on the ideological violence of the twentieth century. The paper considers various aspects of the social character of the Spanish Americans of this area, their concepts of manliness, and their religion, as these affect both rich and poor, and contrasts these features with the attitudes of the indigenous Indian community. Having established that political violence is endemic in the region, the paper considers the role of Hispanic culture in shaping this violence. Emphasis is placed on the notion of machismo, which is identified not with pleasure seeking but with defiance of death. The attitudes of the people of this area toward death shape their attitudes toward violence. They are shown to have a fascination with the instruments of death, especially the machete among the lower classes and the gun among the university students. These attitudes are contrasted with the relatively non-violent attitudes of the Indians. The studies cited in this paper show the Indians as less interested in competition and aggression that the Hispanic population. In the last analysis, the violence of the Central American is intensely personal and can be shown to derive from the basic social and cultural fabric of the society.",

We used network analysis to develop a network of the pattern of causes that are involved. Overall most participants identified a nexus of causes that reciprocally linked religious prejudice, racism and the history of conflict in the Middle East. They identified a reciprocal link between religious prejudice and September 11th, indicating that it was a cause and effect of religious prejudice. They also supported a link between the personalities of Bush and Saddam and economic gain, and acknowledged the effect of the first Gulf war on Saddam. We also found that Muslim participants were significantly less in favour of the invasion than Christian participants, and produced different networks of the links between causes. The study demonstrates that network analysis can be used to compare and contrast representations of a political event, and thus extends its use in the study of social representations. Aggr.

    "abstract": "An adolescent wild male Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), following Kinkazan A troop, was attacked one-sidedly by multiple members of the troop. The victim was identified as PI, and was estimated to be seven+/-one year old. The aggressive interaction was recorded by video camera until the end. Although at least 16 troop members approached PI more than once, only three males (one adult, two adolescents) of A troop attacked him. PI kept crouching throughout the attack, then escaped to the shore and dived into the sea. The interaction continued for more than one hour. PI was found dead a few hours after the end of interaction. The damage caused by the assailants was not the direct cause of PI's death; it was due to hypothermia caused by drifting in the sea. PI's life history was reconstructed from past records. PI was a normal adolescent male who migrated from an all-male group around B1 troop and started ranging around A troop. The aggressive interaction is believed to be a typical example of conflict between troop males and a nontroop male. The interaction period was very long compared with previous reports on such conflicts among Japanese macaques. PI kept crouching in open areas, exposing himself as a potential competitor for the resources of the troop, and did not show any submissive or reconciliatory behavior toward the troop males. This may be why the troop males did not stop the attack.",

    "abstract": "Two studies tested whether attributions of hostile intent (AHI) and anger for ambiguous child behaviors uniquely predict parents' harsh verbal discipline (HVD) and harsh physical discipline (HPD) or whether AHI only predicts harsh discipline when AHI occurs in conjunction with anger, as suggested by the Integrated Cognitive Model of general aggression (Wilkowski & Robinson, 2010, J. Pers., 78, 9-38). Replicating previous studies, the expected positive bivariate relationships between AHI, anger, HVD, and HPD were found in Study 1 (N = 493). However, when AHI, anger, and the AHI by anger interaction were considered simultaneously, patterns of prediction varied by discipline type. For HVD, high levels of AHI, high levels of anger, and the AHI by anger interaction (at high levels of AHI and anger) each were significant predictors. For HPD, low levels of AHI, high levels of anger, and the AHI by anger interaction (at high levels of AHI and anger) were significant predictors, suggesting a possible suppressor effect for AHI. These results were replicated in Study 2 ( N = 503). Thus, there was support for the contention that AHI only predicts harsh discipline when AHI occurs in conjunction with anger with respect to HPD but this was not the case for HVD. Since AHI suppressor effects were observed for HPD in two large sample studies, variables that may account for the AHI suppressor effects and the need for testing more complex interactive predictive models of harsh parenting behaviors are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Rough-and-tumble play (RTP), also known as play fighting, is a common form of play frequently reported and studied by researchers. However, one important limitation of past research in the area of RTP has been the neglect of the adolescence period. Consequently, little is known about the function of adolescent RTP as well as about clinical characteristics of youth who engage in this activity after childhood. In a school-based sample of 1,771 middle school students (ages 9-16 years), the current study sought to address this gap by examining, via bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, the potential cross-sectional associations of adolescent RTP with (a) selected demographic variables, (b) conduct problem symptoms, (c) substance use, and (d) risk-taking behaviors, including adjustment for several demographic confounders. Results indicated that adolescents reporting higher rates of conduct problem symptoms were more likely to report a recent participation in RTP. In addition, substance use (experimentation and current consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana) and risk behaviors assessed all were strongly associated with an increased likelihood of reporting an engagement in RTP. This finding suggests that participation in this activity probably implicates particular phenotypic characteristics including the propensity to engage in health-damaging behaviors. But the most profound issue raised by this research concerns the strong relationship between RTP and great levels of conduct disorder symptoms, suggesting a possible significant change in the functional significance of RTP in the adolescence period.",

Forty‐six men with intellectual disabilities who had a documented history of criminal offending, and 51 men who also had intellectual disabilities, but no such history, were recruited and asked to complete a computer‐based dot‐probe task using affective pictorial stimuli with randomization, along with measures of distorted cognitions, empathy, and moral reasoning. Those with a history of criminal offending endorsed significantly more offense‐supportive cognitions, had significantly lower general empathy, and more “mature” moral reasoning, as well as a significant attentional bias toward affective pictorial stimuli. Attentional bias significantly predicted offense‐supportive cognitions, and vice versa, having controlled for offense history, and Full‐Scale IQ, but this was not the case for empathy or moral reasoning.

Individuals who were abducted as children into an armed group often experience a higher number of traumatic event types, that is traumatic load and are usually socialized in a violence‐endorsing environment. This study aims to investigate the interaction between age at initial abduction with that of traumatic load, and their influence on appetitive aggression along with perpetration of violent acts by former members of an armed rebel group of both sexes. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted among a target group of formerly abducted rebel‐war survivors (including participants with and without combat experience) from Northern Uganda. Participants included 596 women and 570 men with N = 1,166 ( M age = 32.58, SD age = 9.76, range: 18–80 years). We conducted robust linear regression models to investigate the influence of age at initial abduction, traumatic load, combat experience, and biological sex on appetitive aggression as well as their perpetrated violent acts. Our study shows, appetitive aggression and the number of perpetrated violent acts were specifically increased in individuals who were abducted young, experienced several traumatic events in their lifetime, and with previous combat experience. For perpetrated violence men showed increased levels whereas for appetitive aggression the association was independent of biological sex. Therefore, early abducted individuals with a higher traumatic load, who have combat experience, need to be given special intervention to prevent any further violence.",

Participants were examined in terms of the number of lifetime sex partners they reported, nonrelationship partners, cheating or infidelity, and concurrent relationships. Intelligence and physical violence emerged as being especially likely to boost sex partner accumulation for the number of lifetime sex partners and nonrelationship partners in men. Intelligence also interacted positively with men's violence in cross‐sectional models but not longitudinally. Women's violence was not significant regardless of the outcome or model specification. Intelligence showed less consistent effects for women's mating indicators compared to men. Analyses controlled for well‐known correlates of aggression and sexual behavior and factors associated with beauty, including interviewer reports of survey participants' physical attractiveness and maturity, as well as self‐reported attractiveness, maturity, and health.

    "abstract": "Abstract Females of many vertebrate species are territorial. However, few studies have been performed on territorial aggression and its hormonal bases in females. The present study determined whether dwarf hamster females ( Phodopus campbelli ) display territorial aggression and the role that estradiol (E 2 ) and progesterone (P 4 ) play in this behavior. Two experiments were carried out. First, 28 virgin females were mated with sexually inexperienced males. The females were submitted to oviduct ligation 2 weeks before mating to prevent pregnancy. After 15 days of mating, 16 out of 28 females were submitted to resident‐intruder tests, whereas the remaining 12 females were nonconfronted. Blood samples were collected 30 min after the aggression tests to determine E 2 and P 4 by ELISA. In the second experiment, 40 females were mated with vasectomized males. Thirty days after mating, 30 dwarf hamsters were subjected to ovariectomy; 10 were nontreated, 10 were treated with E 2 , and 10 with P 4 . The remaining 10 were sham‐operated. All females were submitted to resident‐intruder tests, and blood samples were taken to quantify E 2 and P 4 . In the first experiment, 87.5% of dwarf hamster females displayed territorial aggression, and in the second, 100% of females were aggressive. Ovariectomy and ovariectomy plus E 2 or P 4 replacement did not affect aggressive territorial behavior. These results showed that this species' females are territorial, and this behavior is not dependent on ovarian steroid hormones.",

It is also unclear how offender subtypes develop after young adulthood or how offending heterogeneity varies between genders. This study aimed to identify subgroups of offending among adolescents with misuse problems and to examine associations with offending in adulthood. The study included 1,992 females and males that consulted a clinic for adolescents with misuse problems between 1968 and 1971. Latent Class Analyses were conducted to identify subgroups based on violent and nonviolent offending before age 20. Participants were then followed until age 50 and reexamined regarding violent, nonviolent, and substance-related crimes. Associations between subgroups before age 20 and subgroups age 21-50 were examined. Before age 20, three subgroups were identified among the females and six among the males. Males were more specialized in their offending and demonstrated higher levels of offending. Results pointed to both stability and decrease of violent and nonviolent offending, and to the emergence of substance-related offending in adulthood in both genders. The connection between substance-related crimes and general delinquency in adulthood among individuals treated for substance misuse suggests that interventions should also address substance misuse for reducing the overall volume of crime. This study also highlights the importance of including females in research on offending heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aggression is an important component of an animal's defense when protecting offspring from predators. Ground nesting birds use a variety of defense strategies. However, their choice according to situation context is poorly known, especially in nonpasserines and in the subtropics and tropics. The ability to distinguish between differently dangerous predator species and the opportunity to share defense with conspecifics are potentially important but little‐studied aspects of nest defense strategy. We experimentally studied the nest defense of Red‐Wattled Lapwing in an individually marked population in a desert area near Dubai, UAE. We used three stuffed models representing 1) a predator dangerous both to adults and to nests (a cat), 2) a nest predator (a raven), and 3) a harmless reference model (a moorhen). We confirmed that the lapwings distinguished between predator species (being most aggressive toward the cat, and least aggressive toward the moorhen) and adjusted their defense strategy accordingly. In addition, conspecific visitors play a variety of roles in parents' defense strategy. They can strengthen the parental reaction, or they can assist in distracting a predator. The visitors included not only nesting neighbors but also nonbreeding floaters. Both parents participated in nest defense to a similar extent, regardless of incubation stage and ambient temperature. This study provides new insight into the complexity of the defensive patterns in ground‐nesting birds inhabiting a hot environment. Comparative experimental research on a range of environments, with various bird species and predator models, can help us to understand the drivers of these defensive behavioral patterns.",

    "abstract": "Experiencing a thought about harming or injuring another person is commonly reported by the general population. Aggressive intrusive thoughts (AITs) and aggressive scripts are two constructs commonly used to define the experience of thinking about harming another person. However, they are generally investigated separately and with two significantly different population groups; respectively, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder and people with a history of violent behavior. AITs and aggressive scripts are assumed to have very different implications for violence risk assessment, but conceptual overlap and an absence of empirical research renders this assumption premature. Using a battery of self-report measures, this study aimed to investigate the differential predictors of AITs and aggressive script rehearsal in a nonclinical sample. Additionally, using regression analyses, the predictors of self-reported aggressive behavior were explored in a sample of 412 adults (73% females; Mage = 31.96 years, SD = 11.02). Violence-supportive beliefs and frequency of anger rumination predicted the frequency of aggressive script rehearsal, and aggressive script rehearsal, anger rumination, and violence-supportive beliefs predicted a history of aggressive behavior. In contrast, obsessive beliefs were predictive of AITs, and only AITs were related to ego-dystonicity. Both AITs and aggressive script rehearsal were related to the use of thought control strategies. These findings support the contributions that maladaptive beliefs have in the experience of aggressive scripts and AITs. Beliefs about violence, a history of aggressive behavior, and ego-dystonicity appear to differentiate aggressive scripts from AITs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, using the self/other adjective judgment task, we aimed to explore how people perceive themselves in comparison to various other people, including friends, strangers, and those they dislike. Next, using representational similarity analysis, we sought to elucidate how these perceptual similarities and differences are represented in brain activity and how aggressiveness is related to these representations. Behavioral ratings show that, on average, people tend to consider themselves more like their friends than neutral strangers, and least like people they dislike. This pattern of similarity is positively correlated with neural representation in social and cognitive circuits of the brain and negatively correlated with neural representation in emotional centers that may represent emotional arousal associated with various social objects. Aggressiveness seems to predispose a person to a pattern of behavior that is the opposite of the average pattern, that is, a tendency to think of oneself as less like one's friends and more like one's enemies. This corresponds to an increase in the similarity of the behavioral representation with the representation in the emotional centers and a decrease in its similarity with the representation in the social and cognitive centers. This can be seen as evidence that in individuals prone to aggression, behavior in the social environment may depend to a greater extent on the representation of social objects in the emotional rather than social and cognitive brain circuits.",

Yet it remains unclear how these malevolent tendencies towards outgroups relate to sadism. Sadists often harm others, driven by a desire to feel pleasure from their suffering. In attempt to bridge these two lines of research, this work examined relationships between sadism and aggression against ingroup and outgroup members in three studies (total N = 755) that focused on two groups with a history of conflict (i.e., the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland). Across all studies, British participants’ sadistic tendencies were just as strongly linked to their aggression against ingroup members (i.e., British partners) as to their aggression against outgroup members (i.e., Irish partners). Despite this lack of a preference for greater outgroup aggression, they tended to enjoy outgroup aggression more than ingroup aggression, especially at its extreme levels. These findings extend works linking sadism to aggression into the domain of intergroup relations and bind together research on sadism and intergroup schadenfreude.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic exposure to trauma and violence can promote aggressive behavior. Oxytocin and variants in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene may play a role in the etiology of proactive, that is, goal‐oriented instrumental aggression, or reactive aggression, which typically occurs in response to emotionally triggering situations. The current study builds on previous findings that experienced and witnessed trauma in childhood predicts higher levels of appetitive aggression, a form of proactive aggression characterized by the enjoyment of participating in violent behavior. The current study explores the role of OXTR rs2254298 and rs53576 variants in appetitive and reactive aggression. Adult males living in Cape Town, South Africa, and at risk for violent behavior completed the Appetitive Aggression Scale (AAS) and Buss–Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ). OXTR rs2254298 and rs53576 were successfully genotyped via restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in 238 and 239 participants, respectively. Regression analysis showed that rs2254298 G/G and A/G genotypes and the rs53576 A/G genotype were significantly associated with lower AAS scores ( p &lt; .001) compared to the A/A genotype. Additionally, genotype interaction analyses conducted in 232 participants, found that the combination of rs2254298 A/G and rs53576 G/G genotypes produced opposite effects on appetitive and reactive aggression. Specifically, this combination was associated with a 0.29‐point increase in AAS scores ( p = .032) and a 0.13‐point decrease in BPAQ scores ( p = .037) when compared to A‐allele homozygosity for both variants. These results suggest that genetic variation in a signaling system involved in influencing environmental and social salience may contribute to appetitive aggression.",

We collected longitudinal data from 1005 middle school students using the Multidimensional Peer Victimization Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory. Then we conducted latent profile analysis, latent transition analysis, and logistic regression analysis. The results reveal the presence of three depression‐anxiety profiles among participants: low depression‐anxiety group, moderate depression‐anxiety group, and high depression‐anxiety group. As verbal and relational victimization increase, adolescents are more likely to transition to a higher level of depression‐anxiety profile. However, an increase in physical and property victimization predicts a transition to a lower level of depression‐anxiety profile. The diverse effects resulting from different forms of victimization exhibit gender differences. For boys, an increase in relational victimization made participants in the moderate depression‐anxiety group more likely to transition to the high depression‐anxiety group, whereas this effect was not significant among girls. This study is theoretically significant for understanding the link between depression, anxiety, and their influencing factors. It suggests that educators, while addressing verbal and relational harm in adolescents, should reconsider the potential impact of physical and property harm. Opportunities to transform negative events into positive ones should be explored. Educators should tailor their focus based on gender, with a particular emphasis on addressing relational harm among male students. This underscores the need for differentiated approaches to effectively support students.",

The most popular approach in research examining (specifically reactive) aggression is the use of wearable technologies that can non-invasively measure heart rate variability (HRV), a cardiovascular phenomenon impacted by activation of the parasympathetic (\"rest and digest\") nervous system. But there is a problem: no one has systematically analyzed the results of these studies to determine if HRV is an effective predictor of reactive aggression. We surveyed an initial 705 articles, producing 48 effect estimates amenable to meta-analysis. Counter to predictions derived from polyvagal theory, the results reveal no correlation between HRV and reactive aggression. We discuss the implications of this novel finding for theory and practice, considering both the complexity of identifying effective biomarkers and the practical limitations driving methodological decisions in aggression research. We conclude that there is no empirical evidence supporting HRV as a valid biomarker of aggression.",

Behavioral and electrocardiographic responses of male intruders were simultaneously recorded. Cardiac electrical activity was measured by means of a telemetry system which ensured preservation of intruder's behavioral repertoire. Behavioral response to maternal attack was evaluated in terms of percent time spent in passive/submissive (p/s) and active/non-submissive (a/ns) patterns. This allowed us to classify the intruders as submissive, non-submissive, and intermediates. During the test, a significant decrease of average R-R interval (R-R) compared to baseline conditions and the occurrence of arrythmias of different nature were found. Ventricular arrhythmias, including premature ventricular beats and ventricular tachycardias, were present in all the intruders while R-R fluctuations and II degree atrioventricular (A-V) blocks only appeared in submissive and intermediate rats. Most ventricular arrhythmias occurred within the upper range of heart rate and were preceded by periods of low R-R variability. These electrocardiographic events were temporally associated with a/ns behavioral patterns and were related to an increased prevalence of sympathetic activity. On the other hand, R-R fluctuations and II degree A-V blocks preceded by high R-R variability were synchronized with p/s behavior and were ascribed to a predominant inhibitory effect of vagal activation which becomes more pronounced as the level of sympathetic activity increases. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

After 23 weeks of isolation all animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Plasma was collected for corticosterone assay, and paired adrenals were used to assay catecholamine levels. On the basis of the frequency and/or the absence of fighting, the mice were segregated into fighters (n = 22) and non-fighters (n = 17). Analysis of the data by Pearson's product moment correlation and Student's t-test showed that elevated sympathetic-adrenal activity was positively correlated with aggression and that elevated adrenocortical activity was negatively correlated with aggression.",

    "abstract": "The defense of offspring, termed maternal aggression, is a highly conserved behavior in mammals, including rodents. This study examined relative levels of maternal aggression in two closely related dwarf hamster species, Phodopus campbelli and P. sungorus, that normally inhabit high latitude, boreal environments. When tested with first litters and with the breeder male remaining with the female (for P. campbelli the male is necessary for successful rearing of offspring), both species exhibited high levels of maternal aggression with average duration of aggressive behavior>80 sec for a 10 min test. For P. sungorus, males are not required to rear offspring. P. sungorus females with either one or multiple litters (singly housed after impregnation) exhibited significantly higher levels of aggression (>300 sec) relative to females co-housed with the sires. In terms of species differences in attack style, P. campbelli exhibited a boxing or clawing strategy for ∼50% of total attack time, but for P. sungorus, this form of attack occurred<5% of the time. For P. sungorus, attacks to the vulnerable belly and flank constituted>90% of all attacks, but these regions were attacked ∼50% of the time for P. campbelli. A survey of levels of maternal aggression of rodents in other genera suggests that maternal aggression in Phodopus is at the high end of the spectrum. Results of this study suggest that the presence of the breeder male may actually suppress aggression in P. sungorus. This fact, as well as its high level of aggression and its distant relationship to mice and rats, suggest P. sungorus as a possible model for future studies on the neurobiological basis of maternal aggression. The relationship between the high rates of maternal aggression and life history strategy in Phodopus is discussed. Aggr. Behav. 00:000–000, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In theory, the use of tools to fend off animal attacks would be more effective than resisting bare‐handed, yet evidence for the advantage of tool‐aided defense is scarce and equivocal. Two studies of news accounts of wild animal attacks against humans were conducted to test the hypothesis that tool‐aided defense is indeed associated with reductions in injuries and deaths. Results of both Study 1 ( N =172) and Study 2 ( N =370) supported the hypothesis. The observed survival advantage of tool‐aided defense for modern humans suggests that this tactic also would have worked for human ancestors who lived more closely to dangerous wild animals. Aggr.

He also proposes that they can occur without “processing,” that is, without meaning. He contrasts his position with that of social information processing (SIP) models, which he casts as positing only controlled processing mechanisms for aggressive behavior. However, both CNA and SIP models posit automatic as well as controlled processes in aggressive behavior. Most aggressive behaviors occur through automatic processes, which are nonetheless rule governed. SIP models differ from the CNA model in asserting the essential role of meaning (often through nonconscious, automatic, and emotional processes) in mediating the link between a stimulus and an angry aggressive behavioral response.

A sample of 2155 children recruited from 30 primary schools in Taipei, Taiwan completed surveys in both 2015 (5th grade) and 2016 (6th grade). Latent transition analysis (LTA) was performed, and the results identified three latent statuses of aggression: “None,” “School aggression,” and “Cyber‐aggression.” About 10% of children behaved aggressively. When in their 5th‐grade year, boys were more likely than girls to be a school aggressor (6.48% vs. 4.04%) or a cyber‐aggressor (2.37% vs. 1.64%). Among boys who originally were considered to be a school aggressor, 36.19% remained so, 58% renounced their school aggression status, and 5.81% became a cyber‐aggressor. Among girls who originally were considered to be a cyber‐aggressor, 22.23% remained so, 68.29% renounced their cyber‐aggression status, and 9.48% became a school aggressor. Controlling for student's academic performance, household income, and parents' marital status, exposure to online violence was a statistically significant predictor of aggression status for both boys and girls. Children's exposure to online violence appeared to increase the risk of aggression.",

In this study, skin conductance responses in a conditioning task involving both monetary/social reward and punishment as unconditioned stimuli were assessed in 340 male and female 8- to 9-year-old children from the community. Children reported their reactive and proactive aggression using the Reactive and Proactive Aggression Questionnaire (RPQ; Raine et al., 2006). Results showed that monetary/social reward and punishment were effective in eliciting physiological classical conditioning in children, and that reduced reward conditioning was associated with high levels of proactive aggression in particular. Findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between reactive and proactive aggression when examining antisocial behavior in children, and suggest that reward-oriented treatment programs may not be effective for children with more proactive, instrumental aggressive behavior.",

The experience of witnessing relational aggression was found to be systematically associated with college students' behavioral responses to relational aggression through two social cognitive processes: normative beliefs about relational aggression and susceptibility to peer influence. The experience of witnessing relational aggression was associated with defending behavior through normative beliefs about relational aggression and both assisting and reinforcing behavior through normative beliefs about relational aggression and susceptibility to peer influence. The experience of witnessing relational aggression was also associated with onlooking behavior through normative beliefs about relational aggression.

This study tested a hypothesis derived from these approaches: that parents would be less physically aggressive than non-parents because of the damage any physical injury would do to their inclusive fitness. Analysis was carried out using the United States federal sentencing records for 1994-1999 (22,344 individuals). The proportion of theft convictions which were violent (robbery; vs. larceny) was significantly greater for men than women (odds ratio 7.7). As predicted, non-parents were significantly more likely to be violent than parents (odds ratio 1.6). Parenthood had a similar effect on relative rates of violence in men and women, although the baseline was considerably higher for men. There was also a significant effect in men of marital status, which interacted with parental status such that parenthood was only associated with a reduction in rates of violence in males recorded as partnered. The results are interpreted in terms of both evolutionary theory and recent work on the hormonal impacts of marriage and parenthood. Aggr. Behav. 42:577-584, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

A total of 5724 early adolescents (mean age: 13.5 years) were recruited from three middle schools in Anhui Province, China. The participants were invited to complete self-report questionnaires regarding their history of CM, BPF, aggression, and homicidal ideation. Mediation analyses were evaluated using structural equation modeling. A total of 669 participants (11.7%) reported homicidal ideation in the past 6 months. CM victimization was positively associated with homicidal ideation after adjusting for covariates. Furthermore, the serial mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect of CM on homicidal ideation through BPF and subsequent aggression. Exposure to maltreatment in childhood is likely to manifest BPF and subsequently higher levels of aggression, which in turn are related to increased homicidal ideation. These findings suggest the need for early intervention for BPF and aggression in early adolescents exposed to CM to prevent the development of homicidal ideation.",

A naturalistic observation was used to collect data with a sample of 245 college students at three time points with 2 weeks apart. Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models were used to disaggregate within-person effects (autoregressive and cross-lagged effects) from the between-person (latent trait-level) associations. The findings revealed that there were autoregressive effects of psychological aggression between Time 1 (T1) and Time 2 (T2) and of physical aggression between T1 and T2. There was a bidirectional association between psychological aggression and somatic symptoms at T2 and Time 3 (T3), in which T2 psychological aggression predicted T3 somatic symptoms and verse vera. T1 drug use predicted T2 physical aggression, which in turn predicted T3 somatic symptoms, indicating physical aggression being a mediator between earlier drug use and later somatic symptoms. Distress tolerance was negatively associated with psychological aggression and somatic symptoms, respectively, and such an influence did not differ across time occasions. The findings indicated the importance of incorporating physical health in the prevention and intervention of psychological aggression. Clinicians may also consider including psychological aggression in the screening of somatic symptoms or physical health. Empirical-supported therapy components for enhancing distress tolerance may help mitigate psychological aggression and somatic symptoms.",

Although research has examined how trait aggression relates to affect and self‐esteem, state aggression has received little attention. To this end, we had 120 US undergraduates participate in a 14‐day daily diary study where they responded to state‐level measures of aggression, affect, and self‐esteem. Crucially, we used multifaceted state measures of both aggression (anger, hostility, verbal aggression, physical aggression) and affect (positive vs. negative, activated vs. deactivated). Multilevel models revealed that daily anger and hostility related positively to daily negative affect and negatively to daily positive affect. Similarly, daily anger and hostility related negatively to daily self‐esteem. In contrast, daily verbal and physical aggression were largely unrelated to daily affect and self‐esteem; however, unexpectedly, daily physical aggression related positively to daily positive activated affect, but only when controlling for the other daily aggression domains. Overall, daily attitudinal aggression measures—anger and hostility—related to daily affect and self‐esteem in theoretically consistent ways, whereas daily behavioral aggression measures—verbal and physical aggression—did not. Our findings support expanding the General Aggression Model to incorporate state‐level processes.",

Sexual violence is positively associated with machismo, with sexist beliefs having been found to be linked with the Dark Tetrad and with the acceptance of sexual violence. Using a community sample comprising 362 adults between the ages of 18 and 70 ( M = 35.6, SD = 14.3) and three self‐report measures, this cross‐sectional study aimed to explore the mediating role of sexual machismo in the relationship between each of the Dark Tetrad traits and the acceptance of sexual violence, both in the overall sample and by gender, as well as whether a significant variance in this acceptance is explained by the “dark” traits, sexual machismo, and gender. In the regression, sexual machismo (the male) gender, and only Machiavellianism were uniquely associated with the acceptance of sexual violence, and sexual machismo partially mediated the associations between the Dark Tetrad and the acceptance of sexual violence. These findings indicate that being male and higher in sexism is more closely linked with the acceptance of sexual violence than most Dark Tetrad traits. Moreover, the associations between the Dark Tetrad, sexual machismo, and the acceptance of sexual violence were stronger in men, consistent with the notion that these traits facilitate a “male” exploitive mating strategy, which likely also extends to victim‐blaming and positive attitudes about sexual violence more broadly. Lastly, the results emphasize the pervasiveness of beliefs about male superiority over women and its relationship with victim‐blaming even in women.",

Two hundred US parent−child dyads completed measures to assess cyberbullying perpetration, cyberbullying attitudes, cyberbullying perceptions, and anonymity perceptions. Results showed support for BGCM postulates for parents and adolescents; however, the mediated relationship was stronger for youth than adults. Moreover, cyberbullying perceptions correlated strongly with cyberbullying attitudes and cyberbullying perpetration. Results are discussed in terms of theory and intervention applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of the current study was to investigate the longitudinal association of facets of mindfulness with aggression and non‐suicidal self‐injury (NSSI) among adolescents and to explore whether shame‐proneness can mediate the longitudinal association. The present longitudinal study investigated the associations between mindfulness, aggression, and NSSI in a sample of 706 Chinese adolescents (M = 15.33; SD = 1.34; 50.20% girls). Five facet mindfulness questionnaire was completed at baseline and middle school students' shame scale was completed at 6‐month follow‐up. The Chinese version of Buss−Perry aggression questionnaire and adolescents' self‐harm scale were completed at both baseline and 6‐month follow‐up. Shame‐proneness significantly mediated the longitudinal association between (a) describing and aggression (−0.107, 95% CI: [−0.151 to −0.067]), and NSSI (−0.041, 95% CI: [−0.069 to −0.019]). (b) Acting with awareness and aggression (−0.094, 95% CI: [−0.139 to −0.061]), and NSSI (−0.036, 95% CI: [−0.062 to −0.016]). (c) Nonjudging and aggression (−0.062, 95% CI: [−0.107 to −0.024]) and NSSI (−0.024, 95% CI: [−0.047 to −0.008]). Describing, acting with awareness, and nonjudging were predictive factors of aggression and self‐injury in adolescents, and shame‐proneness played a crucial role in the negative longitudinal association between them. Findings from the current study may offer some implications in the domains of clinical practice and education to improve mental health and further ameliorate the misbehavior among adolescents.",

Damaging biting during subsequent fighting was dramatically reduced in fish which had been surrounded for several weeks by conspecifics, even though the overstimulated fish performed only opercular and fin displays to the fish surrounding them, not biting. The latency to opercular display was diminished, but the rate once opercular display began was not significantly different. In the 18 encounters observed, a socially overstimulated fish never dominated a control fish. This result suggests a visually mediated mechanism, which reduces biting tendency when there is prolonged, inescapable visual exposure to mildly aggression-releasing stimuli similar to those which trigger biting in live encounters. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The role played by the neonatal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) system in the organization and sexual differentiation of adult agonistic behavior was investigated in rats. Focus was on the 5HT2 receptor subtype, which has been demonstrated to be involved in agonism control in the adult. 5HT2 activity was experimentally manipulated by administration of a specific agonist [1-(2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCl (DOI)] or antagonist (ritanserin) during the second week of life, when serotonin is known to concur to anatomical and behavioral sexual differentiation. Interactions between early 5HT2 activity, genetic sex, and neonatal circulating testosterone (T) were studied by administering the ligands to males, females, and androgenized females. At adulthood, the animals were tested for both aspects of agonism, i. e., aggression and defense, in a 20-min confrontation with an unfamiliar conspecific of the same sex, age, body weight, and social experience. Neonatal administration of the 5HT2 antagonist ritanserin increased aggression independently of sex; it also increased defense, but this effect was confined to males. The agonist DOI had no effect on aggression, but enhanced defense in males and androgenized females, with an effect which depended therefore more on neonatal T than genetic sex. Females appeared in general less sensitive to neonatal 5HT2 manipulation than both androgenized females and males; this suggests that neonatal T is crucial for experimental modifications of neonatal 5HT2 activity to have any consistent effect on adult agonistic behavior. On the other hand, effects observed in males and androgenized females were dependent on the behavior considered and the drug administered. This was especially evident for defense, enhanced by ritanserin in males only, and in both males and androgenized females by DOI. Neonatal 5HT2 activity seems therefore to play a role in the modulation of adult agonistic behaviors, which depends on the behavior considered and is under multiple control of genetic sex and hormonal neonatal substrate. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

A chance for the intruder to retreat was manipulated by testing the resident females in either a single- or a two-compartment cage. The effect of a protected nest was examined by providing females with a nest box having a narrow entrance. During each test, an infanticidal adult male was introduced into the cage of a resident female and her pups. I observed that neither the presence of a protected nest nor the chance for the intruders to retreat to a different compartment, or a combination of the two, increased the ability of a female to defend her litter against an intruder male. Moreover, neither of these two factors influenced the overall behavior of the resident females. I obtained similar results after using data from previous studies to examine the influence of both of these factors on the efficiency of maternal aggression. Overall, these two approaches showed that females are often unable to prevent intruders from committing infanticide. I discuss the validity of the hypothesis that maternal aggression evolved as a mechanism to protect offspring from infanticide. Aggr. Behav. 24:385–396, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Both techniques revealed that the major dimensions and groupings were in terms of verbal-physical form, familiar other-strangers, and equity-victimization.

    "abstract": "Swiss CD-1 lactating mice show a different pattern of attack toward intruders of differing sex, displaying defensive attack against the male (bites on the head and ventrum associated with fear) and offensive attack against the female (bites on the back and flanks with no elicitation of fear). This dichotomy may reflect diverse functions of maternal aggression: the attack toward males (the more infanticidal gender in laboratory strains) has been interpreted as a counterstrategy to infanticide, whereas the attack toward females may serve to establish a social hierarchy or to space rivals of the same sex. In terms of proximal mechanisms, fear may be a key factor involved in the modulation of the different patterns of attack. In Experiment 1 we compared the pattern of attack of lactating females in Swiss CD-1 and Wild mice toward male and female intruders in relation to fear components of behavior of the attacking dams. Results showed that in Swiss mice, male intruders were attacked with a defensive type of attack accompanied by high levels of fear, whereas female intruders did not elicit fear in the attacking animal but were attacked with an offensive pattern. In Wild mice, both types of intruders were attacked with a defensive pattern; notwithstanding, fear was evident only toward male intruders. This suggests that fear is not totally responsible for the expression of the defensive type of attack. To test the hypothesis that defensive attack toward male and female intruders may be related to the infanticidal potential of the intruder, Experiment 2 examined levels of infanticide in both male and female Swiss CD-1 and Wild mice. Swiss female mice showed virtually no infanticidal behavior, whereas Swiss males and both sexes of Wild mice showed similarly high levels of infanticide (55%–75%). From a game theory perspective, the defensive pattern of maternal attack toward female intruders in Wild mice is discussed as “extreme” defense of a high value resource and thus, functionally, a competitive form of aggression.

It is concluded that, whatever its causes, aggression can be viewed as a persistent trait that may be influenced by situational variables but reveals substantial consistency over time. The findings of studies by Huesmann and Eron in the United States as well as Olweus in Scandinavia were thus supported in this South African investigation.",

Its natural diet consists primarily of arthropods and small vertebrates. In this study, we have evaluated the effects of food deprivation on the predatory behavior of adult male and female grasshopper mice to crickets (Acheta domesticus) and laboratory mice (Mus musculus). Subjects that were food-deprived for 48 hours spent more time eating dead but not living crickets than did controls that were provided free access to laboratory chow. There were no sex differences in the predatory behavior of grasshopper mice to living or dead crickets. Food deprivation also influenced the predatory behavior of grasshopper mice toward laboratory mice. With laboratory chow available ad lib, 6 of 43 (14%) male and 22 of 45 (49%) female grasshopper mice killed and ate laboratory mice within 48 hours of pairing. When deprived of food for 48 hours, 16 of 36 (44%) males and 15 of 19 (79%) females that did not kill in the previous experiment killed and ate laboratory mice. We concluded that food deprivation and type of prey are two variables which influence the frequency and intensity of predatory behaviors of grasshopper mice.",

The combined results suggest that the head of an intact conspecific target selectively controls schedule-induced attack and that the effectiveness of the head in directing attack is inversely related to its physical integrity as a unit without regard to specific features.

    "abstract": "It has been previously suggested that the electrical brain stimulation which elicits quiet-biting attack in the cat actively affects the way the central nervous system processes visual and tactile information concerned with the reflexes involved in the terminal aspects of attack. In order to examine the effects of brain stimulation on a nonterminal aspect of attack – the stimulated cat's selection of and approach to a rat – cats were implanted with attack-eliciting electrodes in both the lateral hypothalamus and the midbrain ventral tegmental area. These cats were then tested in an 8-ft-long cage, one end of which was divided into three, 2-ft-long parallel compartments, whose openings faced the end of the cage from which the cat commenced its approach. An anesthetized rat was placed at the back of one compartment, a bowl of food at the back of another compartment, and the third compartment contained no object. It was found in the first experiment that the attack elicited by nearly all electrodes was selectively directed at the rat. However, the success of the cat in finding the compartment containing the rat varied dramatically for different electrodes in the same cat. Further, these differences were stable and did not change as the cat gained experience with the task. The results suggested that the stimulation of different brain sites in the same cat differentially affected the visual neural mechanisms involved in guiding a cat to a rat. Previous studies have also suggested that the effects of brain stimulation which elicits quiet-biting attack are largely lateralized to the side of the brain stimulated. In order to determine if the effects of stimulation on the neural mechanisms mediating the visually guided approach of a cat to a rat were also lateralized, attempts were made in a second experiment to disrupt the visual input to one side of the brain by unilaterally transecting the optic tract. It was found that this manipulation interfered with the visually guided selective approach to a rat, if the cat was stimulated through hypothalamic or mid-brain electrodes ipsilateral to the optic tract transection, but not if the hypothalamic or midbrain stimulation was on the contralateral (visually intact) side of the brain. However, any final interpretation of the results was confounded by the finding in all of these cats of a complex syndrome of neglect of all contralateral sensory information.",

They were presented with three question series concerning (1) their responses to aggressive attacks; (2) reactions in frustration situations presented in short stories; and (3) their aggressive initiatives. In each series the type of aggressive behaviour, attacker, victim, and other situational factors were systematically varied. In series 2 the type of response, open-ended or forced-choice, was also varied. The results showed that the most valid way of studying boys' self-observations on their aggressive behaviour was to ask if they attack somebody without a specific reason (series 3). This correlated with contemporaneous overt aggression at the age of 8 and predicted aggressiveness and various characteristics of antisocial aggressive development at the ages of 14 and 19. Self-observations on one's physical aggression were more valid for ratings of overt aggressiveness than on verbal aggression. The open-ended or forced-choice type of response did not affect the validity of aggressive responses. Of the categories of nonaggression, ‘conciliatory responses’ had the highest concurrent and predictive validity for constructiveness and other indicators of strong self-control.",

In the PAM, provocation and response were systematically varied under two conditions: the impulsive aggression condition and the controlled aggression condition. In the impulsive condition, no information about the attacker was provided, while in the controlled condition the attackers were specified in terms of sex, age, and physical strength. The task was administered to 109 children aged 8 to 13 years. Boys (n = 61) and girls (n = 48), as well as subgroups of Adjusted (n = 67) and Maladjusted (n = 26) children were compared. The results confirmed earlier findings showing that there is a strong relationship between attack and response intensity. However, this relationship was consistently modified by the effects of situation and personality‐related variables. This meant that, while for the impulsive condition response intensity was closely tied to stimulus intensity, in the controlled condition this effect was modulated by the characteristics of the opponent: the more equal the opponent the stronger the retaliations displayed. The Maladjusted children reacted more intensively in the impulsive condition and to minor provocation in the controlled condition than the Adjusted children. This suggests that the intensity of the elicited aggression in the Maladjusted group was particularly dependent on contextual rather than internal control. Aggr.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the term 'teaching' means activities which induce a specific change in the behavior of a member of the same species, and are adapted until the pupil reaches a certain standard of performance. Teaching in this sense is confined to man, with one group of exceptions. Other forms of social learning are observed among the mammals and even the buds. The most important is imitation, or learning by observation. Teaching by other species always involves punishment, and always leads to the separation or spacing out of individuals. It occurs 1) at weaning, 2) in maintaining status within a group, and 3) in territorial behavior. In each case an animal is punished for approaching another. Man is distinguished by using punishment not only as a deterrent but also in the teaching of skills. Such conduct is sometimes called aggressive. To give it this name is to put teaching (by punishment) in the same class as socially undesirable acts. Such a usage obscures questions that can profitably be asked. Children learn much by imitation, and are encouraged to do so. But teaching of skills (usually not by punishment) and of customs seems to be universal in human communities, both primitive and advanced. To say that there is an instinct or drive to teach adds, however, nothing to this statement. Some teaching, especially the formal process in schools, is by adults and is confined to particular societies. But, in addition, children teach younger children, sometimes evidently without prompting by elders. This is one aspect of the nurturant behavior which is perhaps a feature of all societies. Some traditions seem to be maintained solely by children. Such conduct is probably at times altruistic in the traditional sense of the term. \"Altruism\" in biological writings today has, however, a different meaning, and is therefore becoming a source of confusion. In many communities, both primitive and advanced, nurturant behavior and the teaching of young children by older children are reported to be more prominent among girls than among boys. Teaching, considered as a type of behavior, has been neglected as a subject of study. It would repay multidisciplinary investigation, especially as it appears in the conduct of children.",

The two higher doses (8 and 16 mg/kg) produced a decrease in spontaneous motor activity. Antiaggressive effects were observed after administration of doses from 4 mg/kg upwards. At this dose, CGS 10746B diminished threat and attack, and although an increase in immobility was observed, no impairment of other motor behaviours was presented. With higher doses, aggression was practically abolished but with a concomitant effect on many other behaviours. When animals were separated depending on their latency of attack, those that showed a long attack latency (LAL) presented a stronger response to 4 mg/kg than those that had a short attack latency (SAL), which were not affected in their aggression by this dose. We can conclude that presynaptic dopamine function is necessary for the normal expression of aggressive behaviours, since CGS 10746B reduces aggression at doses that do not affect spontaneous motor activity.

The role of child and familial characteristics in influencing these expectancies was assessed. We examined children's expectations of interadult verbal/psychological and physical aggression during simulated arguments presented to children on videotapes. A community sample ( N = 156) of children and young adolescents (6–14‐year olds) participated. Children expected higher levels of aggression during conflict when they thought that one or both participants in conflict were intoxicated versus sober. Further, higher levels of verbal versus physical interadult conflict were expected during the disputes. These findings build on the literature by demonstrating that elementary school age children and young adolescents exhibit expectancies that link the consumption of alcohol with increased verbal and physical aggression in marital arguments. These alcohol–aggression expectancies were robust and were evident in relation to either the man's or woman's perpetration of aggression against the spouse. Elucidation of factors that can influence associations between aggression and alcohol consumption are of importance and have broad implications for family functioning. Aggr.

Young S. nitor nymphs are known to show active dispersal while old nymphs and adults are contrastingly strongly gregarious, a combination of features never observed in other cockroach species. Our laboratory experiments using video recording of confrontations between pairs show that aggressive behaviour towards conspecific nymphs is not exhibited towards nymphs of the species Phoetalia pallida, and thus can be considered species specific in S. nitor. But, it is not kin oriented: the mother and all adults of both sexes in different physiological states exhibit this behaviour as well. Six types of aggressive interactions were discriminated, occurring in age-symmetric pairs of nymphs and adults. Even more frequent aggression was exhibited by adults and last instar nymphs towards younger nymphs of all instars. The frequency of aggressive acts and types of aggressive interactions varied according to sex and size of the two interacting individuals. The possible function and evolution of this behaviour is discussed, with emphasis on the difficulty of interpreting obvious but weak and not kin-biased aggression.",

A pre–post–follow‐up, experimental–control design was used to evaluate the impact of a small‐group intervention that offered practice in reappraisal skills to 89 aggressive children (another 60 were wait‐listed). Results indicate that treatment children benefitted in these skills more than their peers. Based on multiple sources of the report (child, parent, teacher), results also point to reduced aggression, anger, anxiety, and social problems, and an increase in self‐regulation, all of which sustained at follow‐up 7–8 months later. Finally, many outcomes were correlated with benefits in reappraisal skills. Qualitative data gleaned from the study supports these benefits and sheds light on group processes that were helpful. The findings suggest that reappraisal skills training is a useful intervention with aggressive children and can be successfully delivered in small groups.",

    "abstract": "The blind mole rat (Spalax ehrenbergi) is a solitary and aggressive fossorial rodent that inhabits its own individual tunnel system. Mole rats breed mainly in the winter, giving birth to a litter of three to four young on average [Nevo (1961) Mammalia 25:127–143]. Intraspecific interactions between adults occur mostly during the winter, which is the rainy season in Israel; after parturition, interactions occur between the mother and her offspring and between the siblings themselves until dispersal. Until now, the subterranean habitat of mole rats has prevented direct observation in the wild. Thus, there has been no direct evidence for the proximal factors that drive juvenile mole rats out of the maternal tunnel system as they shift from the social life-style of the young to the solitary life-style of the adult. In the present study, female mole rats were caught in the wild with their offspring and brought to the laboratory. The dispersal process of the young from the maternal nest was followed under two housing conditions: (1) restricted housing, simulating the physical conditions under which dispersal is delayed past the usual age, as often occurs during late winter floods in the field in areas of nonporous clay soils, and (2) nonrestricted housing, simulating the physical conditions that allow the young to disperse from their maternal tunnels at any time. In each housing condition, the mothers raised either one or three pups. During pup development, we monitored both maternal and juvenile agonistic variables during intraspecific interactions. Five major behavioural phases were identified during the ontogeny of the mole rat pups. Maternal aggression toward pups increased mainly in the first three phases of pup development, and sibling aggression increased from the third phase until dispersal. Under the restricted housing conditions, there was a delay in both the appearance of aggression in the “family group” as well as in dispersal age compared with the nonrestricted conditions. In the nonrestricted conditions, increased litter size resulted in delay in dispersal age. We suggest that the main proximate factor initiating natal dispersal is increased intolerance and aggression among siblings rather than maternal aggression. Only after the young began dispersing from the maternal tunnels did maternal aggression dramatically increase, thus preventing the offspring from returning. However, following floods, inhibition of aggression may enable the mole rat pups to stay with the family group and to disperse later when the physical conditions permit it. Aggr.

Males with high-density networks reported more indirect than direct aggression, and less direct aggression than males with low-density networks.

In the present study, we examined the possible influence of competitive status (winner/loser) in three such models: the elevated plus‐maze, the open field, and the social interaction test. One hundred to 135‐day‐old male Wistar rats were conditioned to traverse a straight runway tube to obtain food. Subsequently, two rats were placed at the same time in the runway tube and, being unable to pass each other, one of them pushed the other to the opposite end‐box. The rats were categorized as winners or losers in this competition. One week after the straight runway tube test, the rats were submitted to the anxiety models, where it was observed that winner rats showed greater locomotor activity than the losers in the three models studied. Furthermore, winner rats showed less immobility and higher central and total locomotor activity in the open field and a greater duration of social interaction in the social interaction test. These results suggest that competitive status has an influence on the locomotor activity of rats in animal models of anxiety. However, whether competitive status influences anxiety as assessed in these models is unclear, and further investigations are warranted. Aggr. Behav. 28:164–171, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Focus groups and pair and individual interviews were used to collect data from adolescent girls and their teachers in two schools. The study provides some clear insights into the nature of teenage girls' indirect aggression. The predominant indirectly aggressive behaviors include talking about others and excluding peers from the group. Key explanations for these behaviors concern a desire to create excitement and a range of friendship and group processes centered on girls' needs for close personal relationships and to be a part of the peer group. The girls described the devastating effects of indirect aggression, particularly on girls with certain characteristics that predispose them to victimization. The girls were pessimistic about the potential of interventions, although peer mediation processes may be a way forward. Aggr. Behav. 26:67–83, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Available evidence reveals that, although the incidence of abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) varies between 10% and 15% in the general adult population, abnormal EEGs occur in 48–70% of aggressive psychopaths. The fact that the EEGs of aggressive, adult psychopaths show a high degree of similarity to the EEGs of normal young children has suggested that aggression may somehow result from a failure in the normal development of the central nervous system. This “maturational-retardation” hypothesis of aggression was investigated in the present study, the purpose of which was to discover whether behavior-problem children who are severely aggressive have immature EEGs, or EEGs characteristic of chronologically younger children. Six severely aggressive boys, aged 8.7–13.6 years, had their EEGs recorded while performing a simple reaction task. For each subject, an interval histogram consisting of measurements of the duration of 780 half wavelengths in the EEG was generated by the computer using the tracing from the left parietal-occipital (P3 -02 ) derivation. The resulting histograms were subjected to a central moments analysis and age of each subject was estimated from the moments by means of a multiple regression equation. This equation, which relates an individual's age to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th central moments of his EEG interval histogram, had been derived by Surwillo [1975a] on a group of normal boys. In every case, age predicted from the EEG of a severely aggressive subject was less than the subjecťs actual age. This finding was statistically significant, as the probability of the outcome occurring by chance was only 0.016. The results of the experiment supported the maturational-retardation hypothesis of aggressive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Blind mole rats (Spalax ehrenbergi) are solitary and aggressive subterranean rodents. Aggressive defense behavior in the mole rat functions to deter neighboring competitors from territory, food, and mates and includes seismic and odor signals. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the aggressive defense behavior displayed by male mole rats is testosterone dependent. Five behavioral variables were taken as being representative of such aggressive interaction: exposing teeth, biting, bulldozing movements of the head, soil blocking, and self-grooming. We monitored male testosterone levels and aggressiveness throughout the annual cycle, which can be divided into three main climatic periods: cold and rainy (September–February); warm, during which the soil is still moist and easily excavated (March–May); and hot (June–August), when the soil is hard and dry. In a second experiment the effect of endogenous and exogenous testosterone on male aggressive defense behavior was determined before and after castration and following testosterone propionate replacement. We found fluctuations in male testosterone concentrations, with three peaks: in November, May, and August, one in each of the three climatic periods. However, these fluctuations did not correlate with male aggressive behavior, which remained constant throughout the year. Furthermore, because neither castration nor testosterone propionate replacement in castrated individuals affected their defense behavior, we suggest that such behavior in male mole rats is testosterone independent. The continuous excavation and maintenance of the mole rat's underground tunnel system demands high energy expenditure year-round and constant defense of territory sites and food caches from intraspecific rivals. Thus, although testosterone may fluctuate as a result of seasonal breeding cycles, constant high levels of aggressive defense throughout the year are crucial for the survival of the male mole rat in its solitary subterranean environment.

    "abstract": "Killing of mice was suppressed in 18 out of 24 rats by electrical stimulation of the region ventral to the anterior septum lying between the vertical arm of the diagonal band of Broca and the rostral limb of the anterior commissure. The mean effective minimum stimulation intensity was 8.2 uA (60 HZ, RMS). Stimulation of the cingulate cortex did not suppress mouse killing (mean stimulus intensity: 38.7 uA). Electrical recordings revealed after discharge in response to the stimulation in only one animal. At the stimulation intensity which suppressed mouse killing, there was no significant suppression of eating in 6 of 9 animals tested. These results are consistent with other evidence implicating the region ventral to the anterior septum in the modulation of mouse killing in the rat.",

The Life History of Aggression was completed during a clinician interview. The women used more aggressive tactics to solve conflicts in the premenstrual than in the follicular phase, but the difference was only significant for the PMDD group. During the past year, reasoning was the most common strategy used by women to resolve conflicts, but verbal aggression was also prevalent. Although physical violence was less common, the prevalence of any act of violence was 33% in the controls and 62% in the clinical group. Women with PMDD used both verbal and physical aggression more frequently than the controls and had a higher lifetime history of aggression. Aggression by women toward partners was associated with a general tendency to act aggressively. Aggr. Behav. 29:228–238, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Aspects of the social pecking of domestic chicks in a free response situation were examined in a series of experiments. It was proposed that a dual pattern of responses involving (a) a preponderance of pecks at the head of a conspecific, and (b) heightened emotionality (as indicated by the emission of distress calls) might be taken to reflect an aggressive tendency, and evidence was reviewed that showed that a brief period of isolation was a sufficient condition to elicit such a pattern. The main questions asked in this paper are: (a) whether the gender of a chick had a material influence on the incidence of such social pecking, and (b) whether orders established in pecking exchanges reflected a unidimensional social ordering among chicks. In the 1st set of studies the effect of the sex of subject on rates of social pecking was tested. While an isolation procedure clearly produced the dual pattern of heightened head pecking and calling, reliable sex differences were not in evidence. In a 2nd study, concerned with the generality of social orders as observed in social pecking exchanges, the isolation procedure again was sufficient to produce apparently aggressive reactions but the resulting peck orders between chicks did not predict success in later tests when the same 2 subjects were pitted against one another in either approach or avoidance competitive tasks. These results are discussed in terms of the relationship of infant aggression to adult aggression, and suggestions are made for a revised view of the development of the aggressive behavior of fowl.",

The effects of outcome, sex, trait aggressiveness and current mood on subsequent subject‐generated material were also examined. Fifty subjects read stories line by line on a computer screen. Reading time for the key sentence describing a positive or negative outcome to an aggressive reaction to provocation was recorded and subjects wrote a continuing sentence to half the stories. Subjects took less time to process the negative outcome. The positive outcome resulted in more subject‐generated aggression than the negative outcome. There were few sex differences but men wrote more aggressive endings than women for the stories containing physical aggression. Trait aggressiveness was correlated with producing more aggressive content in the continuing sentence for both outcomes. Feeling peaceful was correlated with producing prosocial material to neutral stories. Subjects therefore expect a negative outcome to aggressive behaviour. Reading stories which present a positive outcome to aggression increases the accessibility of aggressive cognitions. Subjects high in trait aggressiveness are not inhibited by a negative outcome.

Emotions influence the way individuals make inferences about others' behavior. Building on these previous findings, the present research investigates the effects of anger and sadness on the attribution of intentionality. In Experiment 1, angry, sad, or neutral participants read a series of sentences describing simple actions and had to indicate whether the actions were done intentionally or accidentally. Results showed that anger significantly predicted the proportion of intentional judgment when participants were asked to interpret ambiguous sentences. In Experiment 2, the effect of anger on intentionality was replicated. Angry participants endorsed more intentional explanations than neutral participants. This finding helps explain how anger increases the inclination to make hostile inferences.",

Bivariate probit regression models allowed us to examine mutual control as well as unilateral control. Disputes between intimate partners were more likely than disputes between adversaries in other relationships to be precipitated by mutual control, but not unilateral or one‐sided control by men. Disputes between illegal business partners also predicted mutual control, but not unilateral control. Discussions of the motives for violence would benefit from consideration of the classic social psychological literature on power and influence.",

Participants were randomly assigned to receive a scenario, which included one of two levels of status of instigator (high, low), one of two levels of attractiveness of the instigator (unattractive, attractive), and one of two levels of provocation (apology, insult). Sex and dispositional aggressivity were also included in a full factorial design. Based on evolutionary psychology ideas, we anticipated that status and attractiveness would differentially influence expected aggression for men vs. women. Participants in Experiment 1 were instructed to imagine that they were alone, whereas participants in Experiments 2 and 3 imagined themselves in a situation that included mating-related primes. In general expected aggression was greater for aggression-prone participants and under conditions of provocation and/or a high-status instigator. Experiments 2 and 3 found that, in the context of mate competition, sex differences in the effects of instigator provocation, status, and attractiveness emerged: greater aggressivity now only predicted more aggression for males but not females who were insulted; aggression was highest for females confronting an unattractive, high-status instigator and for males confronting an attractive, high-status instigator; females were more likely to aggress against a high-status instigator, regardless of being in a steady relationship or a first date situation, but males were only more likely to aggress against a high-status instigator in a first date situation.",

To date, no studies have similarly examined morally-related cognitive and emotional responses specifically among intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators. However, research on moral cognitions and emotions in response to IPV perpetration may inform understanding of the behavior and potential mechanisms for intervention. In the current series of four studies, we used classical test theory to develop a measure of moral distress following IPV perpetration that focuses on thoughts about the actions (assimilated cognitions), thoughts about the self due to one's actions (accommodated cognitions), and emotions experienced due to one's actions (moral emotions). Items were developed and tested among two samples of undergraduate students, and psychometric properties of the final measure were confirmed among two community samples. The final measure consists of three subscales consisting of five items each. Results demonstrate support for internal consistency and test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity, and factor structure. This measure can be used in future research designed to examine how individuals respond to their IPV perpetration, and to study the implications this may have for long-term outcomes and behavioral change.",

However, due to the dominating individual-centered approach, most findings miss a social network perspective. Consequently, knowledge of negative spillover to different life-domains or crossover to uninvolved individuals alongside a detailed understanding of the involved transmission processes remains scarce. By integrating social aggression theorizing, the present study investigated transmission routes (emphatic, behavioral) of experienced adversities and aggression at work toward perpetration of aggressive behavior and potential spillover and crossover effects into the private life domain in a diary study of 72 mixed dyads. Analyses of mediation based upon the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model revealed an association between the frequency of perpetrating aggressive behavior in the work context and a spillover into the private life domain via aggression-promoting internal states (emotions, cognitions, arousal). Based on the different patterns of mediation, it appears that adversities follow a mental transmission process, whereby experienced aggression displayed behavioral assimilation. In contrast, no crossover effects of exposure to adversities or aggression at work to a study partner at home could be detected. Practical and theoretical implications as well as limitations and ideas for future work are discussed.",

The earlier the pups were isolated, the more they engaged in play activities. Later, in adulthood, the aggression level of the same animals was retested using the same paradigm. The three isolated groups showed a high level of aggression, with significant differences among them. When compared with socially reared subjects, a reliable difference in the level of aggression was also found.

However, before loss of rank in animals can be assessed as a model of human depression, certain requirements must be fulfilled: (1) a situation must be developed in which rank can be determined, and this assessment must, under normal circumstances, remain stable if it is to be the baseline against which experimental manipulations are measured; (2) it must be established that defeat of a dominant animal does indeed cause a change in rank for that animal; and (3) once these practical requirements have been fulfilled, to be a “model of depression,” antidepressant treatment must be seen to reverse the loss of rank caused by defeat. Each of these points is considered in turn. (1) So far, a situation has not been discovered in which social hierarchies are produced that are both unequivocal and stable. (2) Defeat seems to have very variable effects, the variability being most likely due to natural variation in the quality of the defeat “experience” for the recipient. (3) Antidepressant treatment has not yet been shown to reverse the effects of defeat for more than a single test session. In addition, it has not been demonstrated that loss of rank actually produces a lowering of self-esteem in the animal as opposed to helplessness. If the change in self-perception does not change the value the animal attributes to itself, but rather the level of ability the animal attributes to itself, then the model breaks down. Consequently, at this time, the predictive validity of the model has not yet been established. Furthermore, its construct validity may be low. In summary, much more work is required before defeat-induced loss of status in the rat can be properly assessed as a model of loss of self-esteem and depression in humans, although it may be bedevilled by theoretical weaknesses even at this early stage.

The relative early death of the TNA males was discussed in terms of male age-related decline of inherited low levels of catecholamine and androgenous hormone concentrations. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Females of the HI strain showed higher numbers of fighters and greater intensity of fighting than those of the LO strain, and by the second Training Test these differences were significant at p < 0.01. The HI and LO laterality strains thus provide useful tools for investigating the functions of female agonistic behavior and the possible relationship between laterality and the expression of aggression.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on outpatient behavioral management of oppositional-defiant teenagers that engage in aggressive behaviors. Sixteen subjects, 13 male and three female, are followed through an alternating treatment, single case design, ABCD: baseline; cognitive therapy coupled with the REST (Real Economy System for Teens) program for parental outpatient behavioral management; combined cognitive, REST, and response cost; and finally REST with response cost to control aggressive behaviors. The response cost was designed to control aggression. Response cost involved the parents identifying seven reinforcers, objects, and activities that are important to the teen. They are rank ordered, with item one being most important and item seven being least important. An aggressive act means the loss of an item for 1 year, beginning with item seven and progressing upward. This study finds that aggressive behaviors do not decrease with cognitive therapy and the REST program. When the more stringent response cost program is implemented in addition to the cognitive and REST techniques, the acts of aggression do respond to treatment. Thus, it is concluded that adding a stringent parent management response cost program offers a tool therapists can use in treating aggressive, oppositional-defiant teenagers on an outpatient basis without the need for hospitalization.

    "abstract": "The present study examined two explanations for gender differences in expression of direct and indirect aggression. The social sanction model suggests that aggressor and target gender effects may be accounted for in terms of social sanctions against behaving aggressively; indirect aggression is the likely outcome of inhibitions against expression of direct aggression. The threat argument suggests that high levels of direct aggression in male-male dyads as well as apparent inhibitions against harming females might be accounted for by the fact that males are more threatening targets than are females. Research participants completed a questionnaire measure of direct and indirect aggression twice, once with reference to their behavior toward a same-gender target and once with reference to their behavior toward an other-gender target. Although most direct aggression was reported by male aggressors toward male targets, gender of target did not relate to indirect aggression. Males reported approximately equal levels of indirect and direct aggression. Although females reported using more indirect than direct aggression, they did not differ from males in their reports of the frequency of use of indirect aggression. These results provided some support for both models of gender effects on human aggression and suggest the appropriateness of a relatively complex model of gender effects on aggression. Aggr.

The mice were first placed in an arena in which they were allowed either immediate physical contact with another strain (control condition) or were briefly separated from another strain by a transparent partition before being allowed physical access to them (priming condition). Subjects, recorded as either having fought or not fought in the arena, were then placed in a 101 cm square seminatural setting. Seven trials, using 8 LGs each (4 arenaexperienced males and 4 naive females), were made, and agonistic behaviors were recorded for the priming and control condition subjects. The results showed that the control condition fighters (CF) like the priming condition fighters (PF) fought in the arena situation, but different agonistic patterns in the seminatural setting were noted. While in the seminatural environment, both CF and PF mice were attacked frequently and submitted frequently, but PF mice attacked opponents more frequently than did CF subjects (p < 0.025) and elicited significantly more submissions from opponent mice than did CF mice (p < 0.025). It is concluded that: (1) there are more and different agonistic behavior patterns available in the more natural environment than in the arena setting, and more specifically (2) there is a greater effect on agonistic behaviors in a seminatural environment for mice that fought when exposed to the arena priming procedure as compared with mice having fought in the arena control condition.",

It still remains to be demonstrated whether intraspecific variation is narrower than interspecific variation. Herein, we quantified social behavior in a captive group of Japanese macaques ( Macaca fuscata ) to estimate the range of intraspecific variation for a full array of measurements in three different seasons. Despite an increased frequency of aggression found on the part of males during the mating season, the form of the behaviors performed remained relatively unchanged. Transactions during conflicts, approaches, or grooming did not undergo significant variations in relation to season. Frequencies and durations seemed more sensitive to demographic and environmental variations. The values measured in the study group are representative of the Japanese macaque. The results validate the use of transaction measurements in interspecific comparisons, providing that additional factors such as age and sex are taken into account. Aggr.

Again for both species, these subjects subsequently exhibited significantly less aggressive behavior towards conspecifics than did subjects that had been both visually and tactually de-prived.

Data were obtained for each of the 95 Italian provinces on homicide rate and robbery rate from 1992 to 1995. Multiple regressions were used to predict these homicide and robbery rates from a measure of civic engagement (Civicness) assessed during the same period, and from other socioeconomic variables: unemployment, family break up, and geographical characteristics. The predictors explained 77% of the variance among the Italian provinces for robbery, and 61% of the variance for homicide. The predictive patterns were somewhat different for homicide and robbery, but in each case civicness interacted with territorial variables. In the case of homicide, civicness had a preventive impact only in the southern provinces. For robbery, the protective impact was limited to provinces which were urbanized and had large metropolitan areas. Aggr. Behav. 33:56–62, 2007.© 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent decades, researchers in various areas of psychology have challenged the claims of a single mode of information processing, and developed dual‐process models of social behaviors. Although these theories differ on a number of dimensions, they all share the basic assumption that two different modes of information processing operate in making decision and copying behavior. In essence, the common distinction in these perspectives is between controlled vs. automatic, conscious vs. unconscious, and affective vs. cognitive modes of processing. The purpose of Berkowitz's article is to go beyond the notion of automatic processes in order to use classic notions of conditioning and displacement to explain aggressive behavior. I assert that an explanatory framework for psychology of aggression must be anchored not only in the new but also classic theoretical paradigms. However, progress in psychology does not rest solely on the accumulation of theoretical insights. It demands a large body of empirical facts, with attention to incongruities, discordances, and conceptual clarifications. Aggr. Behav. 34:130–132, 2008. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

However, the current authors drew on influential models from evolutionary game theory to suggest that experiences of defeat may modulate this tendency. To examine this, four experiments were conducted to explore how defeat may modulate this aggressive response. In each study, participants executed simulated fight or flight responses based a computerized opponent's facial expression. Across studies, participants were typically faster to initiate fight (than flight) responses against an angry opponent. Simply losing simulated fights (Experiment 1) or experiencing aversive, white noise following simulated losses (Experiment 2) did not eliminate this tendency. However, when aversive noise was specifically experienced after losing to an angry opponent, the automatic aggressive response was eliminated (Experiment 3). This result was directly replicated (Experiment 4). Thus, these studies isolate the cues which automatize submissive behavior and show that fighting experience can modulate even our automatic aggressive responses to others’ anger displays.",

Moreover, hostility may predict aggressive and violent behavior. This study sought to (a) compare average general hostility levels of a large sample of Danish divorcees to the norms of the general adult Danish population, (b) compare general hostility levels between male and female divorcees, and (c) investigate the explanatory value of various sociodemographic and divorce-related factors on postdivorce general hostility and whether these factors differ across gender. Cross-sectional baseline data (N = 1,856) from a larger randomized controlled trial study was used in this study. Normative data from a general sample of Danish adults (N = 2,040) was used for comparisons of hostility levels between our study sample and the Danish background population. This study found that male and female divorcees did not report significantly different hostility levels. However, participants reported significantly higher hostility levels postdivorce than the comparative Danish norm sample. Significant predictors of postdivorce hostility were lower age, lower educational level, infidelity as a reason for divorce, higher degree of postdivorce conflict, worse communication with the former spouse, the former spouse as the initiator of the divorce, and new partner status with neither divorcees having a new partner, or only the former spouse having a new partner. The predictive strength of the factors did not differ across gender. The findings may be especially relevant for interventions targeting problematic outcomes postdivorce (e.g., preventing aggressive behavior).",

Bystanders might be reticent to intervene because they are stuck in \"social dilemmas.\" Social dilemmas are situations in which individuals make decisions based on self-interest due to their lack of confidence that others will join with them in decisions that benefit the collective. In this study, the social dilemmas concept, which comes from game theory and social psychology, was applied to bullying for the first time. A total of 292 middle school students at a private residential school in the United States completed surveys about their bullying-related experiences within their residences of 10 to 12 students of the same gender. Multilevel modeling was employed to assess if and how attitudes, group norms, and social dilemmas predict behavior in bullying situations. The findings suggested that both individual and group factors were associated with behavior in bullying situations and that attitudes, group norms, and social dilemmas each made a unique contribution to predicting behavior in bullying situations.

    "abstract": "Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity was measured in brains from Norway rats and silver foxes showing wild type aggressiveness and from their counterparts selected over 20-25 generations for reduced aggressiveness towards humans (tameness). TH activity in the brain stem and cortex was increased in tame animals of both species compared with aggressive counterparts. Selection increased hypothalamic TH activity in foxes, but decreased it in rats. There was no difference in TH activity in corpus striatum between the tame and aggressive animals. Fetal TH activity in the posterior part of the brain was higher in tame than aggressive rats at day 20 of embryogensis. Increased TH activity in the brain stem and cortex of adult aggressive rats was observed after treatment of their mothers with hydrocortisone on the days 16 and 18 of pregnancy. This elevation in TH activity was associated with attenuation of the defense behavior of aggressive rats. The data suggested that alterations in neural TH activity in tame rats and foxes may be part of the neurochemical basis of their behavioral phenotype which is developed by selection. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

However, this increase was no longer evident following 2 weeks of individual housing. When housed with a female, C57BL/6 mice show significantly more aggression than singly housed mice of the same strain after 72 hr as well as 2, 4, 8 weeks of differential housing. Male C57BL/6 mice housed with a female also show significantly higher levels of aggression than DBA/2 mice living in the same housing condition after 4 or 8 weeks of differential housing. Finally, male DBA/2 mice individually housed for 8 weeks are significantly more aggressive than mice of the same strain housed with a female for the same time. These results indicate that the increase in aggressive behavior observed following isolation and cohabitation with a female in the mouse is not the same phenomenon. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

To be able to study a genotype–environment interaction, mice from two bidirectionally on attack latency selected lines were used. The size of the cage in which the mice grew up had no long-term effect on aggression, neither in the high- nor in the low-aggressive line. Handling, however, significantly increased the adult aggression of males from the low-aggressive line. Despite the differential effect of handling on genetically high- and low-aggressive mice, handling was not able to undo the marked differences in attack latencies between mice from both lines. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Asymmetries in weapon size and body size, both contributing to an animal's fighting ability, may be contradictory in two fighting Macrobrachium rosenbergii males: One male may be larger in body size but smaller in cheliped size than its rival. The aim of the study was to determine the relevance of these two asymmetries in the assessment of relative fighting ability, and to reveal the effect of the asymmetry level on the structure of contests. Thirty contests were staged between male prawns from the ‘blue-clawed’ morphotype and the ‘orange-clawed’ morphotype. The blue-clawed males were 0%, 10%, or 20% larger in cheliped length but 93%, 45%, or 25% smaller in weight, respectively (n = 10), as compared to their orange-clawed opponents. The blue-clawed males with 10% and 20% advantage in cheliped length almost invariably won the contests. When similar in cheliped length, the 93% smaller blue-clawed males still won half of the contests. This indicated that the prawns ignored large asymmetries in body size even when no asymmetry in cheliped size existed. The results suggest that only cheliped size is used by M. rosenbergii males in the assessment of fighting ability. The effect of asymmetry level on contest structure was apparent only with the increase from 10% to 20% difference in cheliped size: Both the frequency and the intensity of fighting were lower in contests between prawns with 20% difference, as compared to 0% and 10% difference in cheliped length.

Morning, afternoon, and evening testosterone levels were assessed after a minimum alcohol abstinence period of 24 hr. Violent and nonviolent men did not differ in plasma total testosterone level on any sampling occasion. In violent men, however, testosterone levels were significantly correlated with hostility, as measured by the Derogatis Symptom Check List. Most violent men were diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASP) [DSM-III-R; 301.70], and the unweighted ASP symptom count also correlated significantly with testosterone levels in these subjects. We suggest that individuals whose life histories involve numerous antisocial behaviors tend to have high testosterone levels even when interpersonal violence is excluded. This, however, does not eliminate the possibility that males who are characterized by high hostility may also have elevated testosterone levels. Violent predisposition and antisocial conduct beginning in early adolescence predict adult aggressive behaviors, which are augmented by power-related alcohol expectancies and alcohol abuse. Aggr.

Of central interest was the effect of an imprinting condition wherein single birds were reared with either a red or green Styrofoam object. In the first experiment, imprinted subjects were given social pecking tests in the absence of the imprinting object, while in the second study the tests for social pecking were conducted in the presence of one of the imprinting objects. In the latter test the object was familiar to one bud of a pair, but was novel to the other animal. The results of both experiments showed that the rate of intersubject pecking of the imprinted subjects was intermediate to, and statistically different from both the low pecking rate of chicks reared in pairs and the high pecking rate of chicks reared in total isolation. The presence of a familiar object during tests in the second study seemed to serve as a secure base since chicks that had been reared with that object exhibited more social pecking than did chicks that were unfamiliar with the object. However, regardless of the provision of the object the social pecking of the imprinted chicks again fell on a point intermediate to the other groups. Hypotheses concerning a) intolerance of figureground movement and b) sheer stress of isolation were advanced to account for these results.",

The first is that brain stimulation elicits this behavior pattern primarily because it affects a specific motivated behavior system that is organized discretely in the midbrain and pons. The second is that forebrain neural activity is modulated in behaviorally significant ways by brainstem stimulation, which elicits predatory-like aggressive behavior in the cat. The possibility that further research on the altered state of central nervous system activity, induced by brain stimulation which elicits aggressive behavior in the cat, may lead to a further understanding of the altered states of central nervous system activity that underlie the aggressive dyscontrol syndrome and other episodic state disorders is discussed.",

    "abstract": "A role-playing study on anger was conducted in order to identify the influence of sex hormones on individual and gender differences in irritation, anger arousal, and aggression. Different groups were studied: female-to-male and male-to-female transsexuals, with either group tested after 3 months of cross-sex hormone treatment, and untreated control women and men. All subjects were exposed to a 35-min videotape of an individual tested in an aversive, physically stressful, and frustrating situation in the laboratory. While watching, subjects were asked to imagine being in the same situation. Meanwhile, cardiovascular responses were registered and the intensity of moods and aggressive behaviour were assessed. Apart from a clear effect upon cardiovascular arousal and anger-related moods, there were also some interesting differences between the four groups, the most interesting one being a stronger aggressive response in the female-to-male transsexuals. Furthermore, interesting information was gathered with respect to the issue of whether role-playing and actual experimentation provide valid tests of anger and aggression in real life. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Female rate living in groups were subjeccted to single and repeated immobllization stress (Restraint, RT). Twenty-four hours after RT, or the last RT session in the case of repeated RT, social behavior was recored in encounters with unfamilar females, matched for age and body weight. Single RT caused an increase in agonistic behavior in both its aggression and defence aspects. This was a specific effect, as other behaviors, including introductory, affiliative (Allo-Grooming), and courting items, were unifluenced by Rate The effect persisted and was even strengthened in the case of aggression, when RT was repeated once a day for 7 consecutive days. These findings, together with previous data showing a reduction in emotionality and an increase in the exploration of the physical environment following RT, suggest that in females mild stress may induce behavioral arousal, with the selective activation of specific social and non-social behavioral parameters. This contrasts with previous findings in male rats, which responded to RT with the depression of several behavioral parameters, including some of the items (aggresion, exploration) activated in females. As already found in males, in females some parameters were affected by repetition of treatment, either RT or control handing. This suggests that manipulation per se does affect social behavior. However, behavioral modifications ascribable to repeated manipulation in no way superimposed, and were clearly distinguish able from, those due to RT. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Fighters typically have been tested against castrated animals coated with either urine or water. Then, if the fighters are more aggressive toward urine-coated castrates than toward water-coated castrates, it is concluded that olfaction plays a role in this discriminatory response. However, it is possible that the fighers might react to behavioral differences between these two groups of castrates caused by the different experimental treatment. Three experiments were conducted to study this possible confound and the role of olfaction in the control of agonistic encounters. The results indicated that 1) the confound is not likely to operate; 2) even if the confound is allowed to operate, it is not an effective discriminatory cue; and 3) anosmic fighters do not exhibit differential attacks toward castrates treated with different chemo-signals. Therefore, the emission and perception of olfactory cues do play an important role in mouse agonistic interactions.",

In the present investigation, behavioral and rating scale data were compared among CD ( n =13), ADHD ( n =20), and CD/ADHD ( n =45) preadolescents during one‐month of multimodal inpatient treatment that included methylphenidate administration. As expected, linear growth curve analyses revealed that CD/ADHD children were the most symptomatic of the three groups. However, all groups benefited from hospitalization, with few differences in treatment responsiveness observed.

The aim of this study was to examine the acute effects of L–741,741 (0.75, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg, i.p), a selective D4 receptor antagonist, on social encounters between male mice using an ethopharmacological approach. Ten min of diadic interactions were staged between a singly housed and an anosmic mouse in a neutral area. These encounters were videotaped and the accumulated time allocated by subjects to ten broad behavioral categories was estimated. Besides other behaviors, the aggressive and motor behaviors were evaluated 30 min after injection using an ethologically based analysis. L–741,741 did not affect significantly offensive behaviors (threat and attack), as compared with the control group. Likewise, motor and anxiety‐related behaviors (such as social investigation, avoidance/flee or defense submission) were not altered after drug administration. These results suggest that dopamine D4 receptor is not involved in the modulation of aggressive behavior. Aggr. Behav. 29:552–557, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rape arrests are higher in US states wherein residents more typically endorse honor values. Because honor values reflect an association between reputation and self‐worth, which is based on one's ability to uphold traditional gender norms, one should expect that women who endorse honor values are motivated to conceal a sexual assault. However, honor values also engender the expectation that women defend their reputations if threatened. Thus, women from honor cultures should be more likely to seek retribution by disclosing a sexual assault to others. The current research investigates the impact of honor values on the recommendation to disclose a sexual assault when women believe the victim is motivated to protect her reputation. We evaluated the role of common post‐rape emotions (shame, anger, and fear) on motivations to either conceal a “victim” status or to punish the transgression. In two studies, US women (total n = 842) responded to vignettes of sexual assault that varied the relationship of the perpetrator (acquaintance or husband). Using path modeling to test the two competing hypotheses, we found that women who endorsed honor values more strongly perceived that the victim of a sexual assault experienced more anger and fear, was more likely to seek retribution, and, in turn, were more likely to recommend that she disclose to confidants (similar across the acquaintance and husband scenarios). These findings may help increase researchers' and practitioners' cultural understanding of the help‐seeking behavior of survivors of sexual assault across different communities.",

In this study, in‐law psychological aggression (InPA) victimization and its association with intimate partner violence (IPV), women′s health, and gender role valuation were examined. A household face‐to‐face survey with random sampling was conducted, and a total of 260 married Chinese women with parents‐in‐law were recruited. Among the participants, 11.2% and 43.1% had experienced InPA victimization and IPV victimization, respectively, and 7.3% had experienced both. Women′s daily contact with parents‐in‐law, anxiety symptoms, demand to obey parents‐in‐law, and the low valuation of the male role significantly positively related to InPA victimization, whereas discussions of in‐law conflict with husbands were significantly negatively related to InPA victimization. Therefore, in developing interventions for women experiencing InPA victimization, the role of the husband in InPA victimization and the risk of co‐occurring InPA and IPV should be considered. These findings reflect the need to raise awareness about the influence of culture on gender roles, the harm caused by InPA victimization, and the urgent need to help Chinese women who are experiencing in‐law conflict.",

The data were based on reports from coroners, newspapers, the San Francisco Police Department, and the census. Time period was used to predict the characteristics of each incident in our multivariate analyses. The evidence suggests that the homicide epidemic during the gold rush was primarily due to a higher incidence of disputes between unrelated persons, including duels and disputes over land, mining claims, and gambling. The offenders during this period were more likely to be males who were armed and intoxicated. The epidemic did not involve particularly high rates of predatory or domestic violence, suggesting that it was unrelated to a general decline in social control. We suggest that the gold rush epidemic in San Francisco was due to an increase in the number of disputes between intoxicated men.",

Augmentation of intraspecific sociability with a concurrent reduction of aggression are characteristic features of diazepam's effects, whereas βC-3-CEE exerts the opposite effects. βC-3-CEE countered the prosocial activity of diazepam and had intrinsic activities on intraspecific behaviour. Some DHβCs (harmalol and 6-methoxy-harmalan) and THβCs (1-methyl-6-hydroxy-THβC and tetrahydronorharmane) may exacerbate aggression at low (BDZ-negative) doses (1 mg/kg), and inhibit such behavior at higher (serotonin-positive) doses (10-15 mg/kg). The ethological profiles of DHβCs were different from the profiles of THβCs. Differences in ethological profiles of βC-3-CEE, DHβCs, and THβCs seem to reflect the neurochemical (mainly BDZ-and serotonergic) properties of these substances.",

    "abstract": "It was predicted from the dopamine-opiate system hypothesis that aggression induced by light tail pressure would be modified by exposure of the animals to radiofrequency electromagnetic energy. In a series of three experiments, it was found that there was a substantial decrease in aggressive behavior during exposure to EM energy at incident power densities as low as 50 μW/cm2. This is consistent with previously published reports that indicate the dopamine and opiate systems of the brain are influenced by exposure to low-intensity EM energy. It would appear that EM energy exposure could be used as a probe in the study of aggression and in relating it to brain chemistry. Since this energy has become ubiquitous in the environment, and quite uneven in distribution, there may be implications for understanding aggressive behavior from a clinical standpoint as well as from the standpoint of necessary controls in experiments.",

Aggressive behaviors of zebra finch pairs were low during non-nesting periods but were maintained at high levels during the three nesting periods: the incubating, hatching, and nestling periods. Defense of the nest site was the prominent functional category of aggression, followed by defense of individual distance. Defense of mate, defense of young, and defense of nesting material rarely occurred. Male and female members of pair bonds shared the duties of defense of the nest site and parental care. During observation times males exhibited greater frequencies of aggressive actions throughout the breeding cycle and females spent a greater amount of time in the nest during the three nesting periods. The pattern and functional categories of aggressive behavior in the zebra finch colonies correspond most closely to the nest site defense hypothesis for the evolution of breeding season aggression.",

Participants (51 elite ice hockey players) were randomly assigned to view one of three video-taped presentations showing eight ice hockey behaviors in either a) a dynamic mode with contextual information, b) a dynamic mode with no context, or c) a static, “freeze-frame” mode. MANOVA results showed that non-aggressive stimuli were perceived as less aggressive, and aggressive stimuli were perceived as more aggressive in dynamic presentations with context than in static presentations.

In addition, they also rated the frequency with which they themselves had aggressed against others in their workplaces. Three hypotheses were investigated: (1) covert forms of aggression, in which aggressors seek to conceal their identity from target persons, are significantly more frequent in workplaces than overt forms of aggression; (2) the greater the perceived injustice reported by employees, the greater their tendency to engage in workplace aggression; and (3) the higher individuals' scores on a measure of the Type A Behavior Pattern, the greater their reported frequency of engaging in various forms of workplace aggression. Results offered support for all three hypotheses. In addition, several demographic variables (participants' age and gender; the physical location of their workplaces) were also found to play a role in the occurrence of workplace aggression. Together, these findings were interpreted as underscoring the importance of establishing close conceptual links between research on workplace aggression and basic research on human aggression. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Even though injury and death are more common consequences of fighting among animals than once believed, they are still relatively infrequent. Modern evolutionary models of animal combat have emphasized that given the threat of retaliation, animals only escalate to more injurious fighting if the benefits outweigh the costs, and then only if threat and bluff fail to achieve the goal. Such models stress the role of communication as to whether animals decide to escalate or not. An alternative view is that failure to produce injury or death arises from the neutralization of one animal's attack by another's defense. That is, attack and defense end in a stalemate that may be misinterpreted by outside observers as an absence of injury producing behavior. As attack typically involves the biting or striking of specific body targets, movements and postures occurring during combat need to be analyzed with respect to their role in gaining or averting such contact. For example, in the combat of muroid rodents the attacker targets the lower dorsum and flanks (low threshold) or face (high threshold), whereas a defender may defensively launch counterstrikes against the attacker's face. Two combat tactics (supine defense and lateral attack) typically present in the fighting of muroid rodents are analyzed in detail to illustrate how targets constrain the movements of combatants. Such a functional analysis of combat assumes that the movements and postures performed are related to their role in the attack and defense of targets. Deviations from such a strict functional interpretation reveal some of the other factors that may constrain the combatants' behavior. For example, body morphology and the aggressiveness of the opponent are shown to be important in deciding the type of combat tactic to use and how it is performed. Finally, movements and postures that are neutral or even counterproductive for attack and defense may be revealed as communicatory. This approach provides a means of analyzing behavior during the \"heat of combat\" that is typically not dealt with in traditional evolutionary models. Aggr.

The time intervals taken into account have cyclic patterns and include circadian, weekly, seasonal, and circannual rhythms. In the behavioural field, chrono‐epidemiology can be and has been applied to studies concerning the causes of death (suicide and homicide), clinical events such as admissions to and contacts with mental healthcare services, and the seasonal distribution of crime involving the use of violence. Frequently reported findings include clear circadian and seasonal rhythms present in the phenomenon of suicide (rhythms more evident in the case of violent suicide); seasonal rhythms in the expression of aggression by patients hospitalised for mental illness; and a circannual recurrence of crimes with a violent component. The intrinsic circadian and seasonal rhythms of some neuronal systems, particularly those of serotonin, involved in the control of mood and impulses, are thought to favour the behavioural rhythms observed, although the contribution of socio‐environmental factors, such as the fluctuation of supportive networks according to time, is also acknowledged. By demonstrating non‐casual recurrence of certain behaviour and by exploring the socio‐biological basis of the rhythms beneath these recurrences, chrono‐epidemiology may offer important etiologic and preventive clues to the understanding of the biological and environmental correlates of aggressive behaviour.

Using a cross‐sectional school survey conducted in one German federal state, two forms of teacher‐targeted aggression were assessed: verbal (insulting, threatening, and mocking) and physical (beating and pushing) aggression. Every ninth student reported verbal aggression, while 0.5% of students reported physical aggression against teachers. Multilevel probability models showed that individual importation factors (low self‐control, male gender, and exposure to severe parental violence), together with individual deprivation factors (repeated victimization by teachers and low school achievement) play a role in explaining teacher‐targeted aggression. The school‐level deprivation factor of negative teacher–student relationships was also relevant, whereas low teacher control and attending lower‐level schools were unrelated to the perpetration of teacher‐targeted aggression. The present study stresses the need to acknowledge the multilevel etiology of teacher‐targeted aggression.",

Although an increased incidence of violent behavior, especially domestic violence, was expected during the pandemic, retrospective analyses have yielded mixed results. Records of ambulance departures to address injuries caused by assaults in the Pilsen region, Czech Republic, during the restrictive measures during the national state of emergency were compared to data from 3 previous years using general linear models. The number and severity of assaults were analyzed for the whole sample and separately for patients of either sex, for residential or nonresidential locations, and for domestic violence. Controlling for the seasonal effects, the number of assaults decreased by 39% during the pandemic restrictions compared to the 3 previous years. No difference was found between the effects of restrictions on assaults resulting in an injury of a male or female patient. The decrease was specifically pronounced in the sample of assaults in nonresidential locations, while no effect of restrictions was observed in assaults in residential locations and domestic assaults. Pandemic restrictions were associated with a decreased incidence of violent assaults that required ambulance services. Although the incidence decreased especially in those assaulted outside of their homes, we found no support for an increase in domestic violence or violence against women. Pandemic restrictions may have served as a protective rather than a risk factor for assaults severe enough to warrant a call for ambulance services.",

    "abstract": "It has been postulated that the violent behavior that characterizes armed conflict is reinforced by the possibility of receiving rewards. The present study examined the potential influence of two types of rewards in an ongoing setting of conflict: extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. Former combatants active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (N = 198) were interviewed and questioned about the way they were recruited, the offenses they committed during combat, their level of perceived intrinsic rewards (i.e., appetitive perception of violence), and the number of received extrinsic rewards during their time in the armed group (e.g., money, extra food, alcohol, or drugs). A moderated multiple regression analysis showed that the number of received extrinsic rewards and the level of intrinsic rewards were significantly positively related to the number of different types of offenses committed. In contrast to our expectations and previous findings, the recruitment type (forced conscription vs. voluntary enlistment) did not moderate this relation. Our findings suggest that both types of rewards play a role in committing violence during combat. We suggest, therefore, that reintegration programs should not only consider the influence of extrinsic rewards, but also need to address the influence of intrinsic rewards to counter violent behavior among former combatants.

Couples ( N = 209) aged 14–18 years participated in a challenging observational laboratory assessment to measure demands (i.e., pressures for a change), as well as demand → partner withdraw and demand → partner avoid sequences. Actor and partner effects were disentangled via dyadic data analyses. The results indicated a fairly consistent pattern in which demand → withdraw and demand → avoid sequences led by either partner were positively associated with both partners' physical and psychological aggression (measured via a dual informant questionnaire method). Further, higher quality demands (i.e., pressures for change that were specific and encouraged both members of the dyad to increase a given behavior) were inversely associated with aggression. Yet, all of the above associations were attenuated to the point of statistical nonsignificance after controlling for hostility. These results suggest two primary possibilities. The associations of demand → withdraw and demand → avoid sequences with dating aggression may be spurious, with the sequences merely markers for hostility, a known correlate of dating aggression. Alternatively, hostility may mediate the relations of demand → withdraw and demand → avoid sequences with dating aggression. Further research is required to test these competing explanations. Implications for preventive intervention are discussed.",

Bangladesh, being a developing country that relies heavily on its labor resource, should have definite methods to protect the workers’ rights and safety. Unfortunately, weak frameworks are in place to prevent it, and the lack of awareness among the workers is helping the problem to establish its roots more firmly. Despite the gravity of workplace abuse and its consequences, comprehensive studies for addressing or understanding the problem at a national level is difficult to find in the context of Bangladesh. Using the latest nationally representative survey namely the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) 2016–17, this study attempts to bridge the existing gaps through an empirical investigation of the factors associated with workplace abuse in Bangladesh. A total of 16,646 participants with males of 75.9% and females of 24.1% are used for the analysis. A probit model analysis has been applied in this paper to explore how the workers’ demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, as well as workplace features, may be associated with experiencing abuse in the workplace. The study finds that younger, less educated, females, elementary job‐holders, non‐governmental organization workers or those who work in the manufacturing, or services sector are more likely to be abused in the workplace. The study also concludes that the number of workers employed, and the hazardous workplace environment may be related to the probability of being abused. Furthermore, this study shows that full‐time workers, workers who are employed temporarily or have an oral contract may face abuse in the workplace more.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this exploratory study, we analyzed the contribution of fathering to relational aggression (RA) in middle childhood and the moderating role of children's temperament and gender. Participants ( N = 234; 46% girls) were attending public elementary school (mean age = 8.15; SD = 1.23) in middle‐class neighborhoods in two Spanish cities. Fathers provided information about their parenting practices using the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, parents gave data on their child's temperament using the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire and children provided information about their peers’ aggressive behavior using the Mini Direct Indirect Aggression Inventory. Fathering dimensions considered were Authoritative Cold, Authoritative Warm, Physical Punishment, and Insecurity; temperament dimensions considered were negative affect (NA), effortful control (EC), activity (AC), and shyness (SH). Gender, fathering, and temperament dimensions additively accounted for a significant proportion of the variance observed in RA. Several significant interactions suggested that the effect of fathering on RA was moderated by temperament and, in some cases, by children's gender. NA increased the potential risk of Authoritative Cold fathering (CF) and, in boys only, of Insecure fathering, while EC potentiated the protective effect of Authoritative‐Warm fathering and, in boys only, buffered the risk effect of CF. SH buffered the risk effect of CF and decreased the protective effect of Authoritative Warm fathering on RA. Lastly, AC also buffered the risk effect of CF on RA. Results are discussed in light of the protective or the vulnerability role of temperament and in relation to models that explain sensitivity differences to environmental contexts.",

Nationally representative data collected from 3,545 currently married women in the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (2012-2013) was used for the current study. Mixed models were estimated separately for physical violence and controlling behavior. Logistic regression was also used to conduct additional analyses. Results indicated that women and their husband's education, and number of adult women in a household were associated with a decrease in physical violence, whereas women's empowerment, and women and their husband's education were associated with a decrease in controlling behavior.

Compared with those with previous convictions, homicide offenders without previous convictions were more likely to be female and a member of an ethnic minority group. More of those without previous convictions belonged to the youngest (<25) and oldest (>55) age groups and were more likely to kill somebody family member or a spouse. Schizophrenia and other delusional disorders as well as affective disorders were more prevalent in those without previous convictions as were mental illness/insanity as a circumstance in homicide, but those without previous convictions were less likely to have been in previous contact with mental health services.

This difference in perception may be due to each person relying heavily on their private thoughts and experiences, which effectively means that perpetrators and victims consider different information, and value that information differently, when judging whether an aggressive behavior is justified. The current manuscript contains four studies that tested these ideas. When judging whether an aggressive behavior is justified, perpetrators reported relying heavily on their thoughts and motives (Studies 1-3) and victims reported relying heavily on their experience of being harmed (Study 2). Further, as people considered the perpetrator's thoughts that led to the aggressive behavior, perpetrators, but not victims, became more confident in their judgments (Study 3). Finally, when judging their aggressive behavior, people felt their judgments were less biased than a \"typical person's\" judgments would be (Study 4). Collectively, these studies demonstrate some of the cognitive reasons that perpetrators and victims disagree on their judgments about whether an aggressive behavior is justified and, consequently, some of the cognitive barriers that need to be overcome for successful conflict resolution to occur.",

However, few studies have focused on proactive and reactive aggression to distinguish the different effects of parental psychological and behavioral control. Moreover, additional longitudinal evidence is needed to understand these links. In the current paper, a three‐wave longitudinal study was conducted to examine the developmental characteristics of proactive and reactive aggression and the role of parental control in China. A total of 484 4th‐ and 7th‐grade students participated at wave 1 (51.65% in 4th‐grade, M age = 11.66 ± 1.52 years), 465 students (52.04% in 4th‐grade) at wave 2, and 447 children (51.90% in 4th‐grade) at wave 3. The results showed that: (1) Proactive aggression in late childhood remained stable overall, while reactive aggression displayed a clear upward trend. (2) In proactive aggression, boys and girls had a consistent developmental trend. The initial level of boys was higher than that of girls. In reactive aggression, the growth rate was inversely associated with their initial level and the initial level of boys in 7th‐grade was significantly higher than that of girls. (3) Both parental psychological and behavioral control positively predicted students’ reactive aggression in 4th‐ and 7th‐grade, whereas only parental behavioral control positively predicted proactive aggression in 7th‐grade students, with no gender differences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Intimate partner aggression (IPA) is a costly and incompletely understood phenomenon. Negative urgency, the tendency to act impulsively in response to negative affect, is predictive of IPA perpetration. Mindfulness, by virtue of its emphasis on nonreactivity to negative affect, is an opposing force to urgent tendencies that may mitigate the negative urgency‐IPA link. Yet, no research to date investigates the interactive effects of negative urgency and mindfulness on IPA perpetration. Two studies were conducted that measured and manipulated multiple facets of mindfulness alongside measures of negative urgency and tendencies of IPA perpetration (combined N = 508 undergraduate students in monogamous intimate relationships). Counter to our preregistered predictions, we found that negative urgency's association with greater IPA perpetration increased at higher levels of mindfulness. These findings suggest that mindfulness may not be a protective factor against IPA perpetration for individuals higher in negative urgency, but rather may serve as a risk factor.",

However, the counterpart to this, what was originally called passive aggression, has gone understudied, and its definition has mutated beyond its original conceptualization. The present two studies ( N 's 196 and 220, respectively) attempted to examine passive aggression as originally defined—the deliberate withholding of behavior to ensure that a target is harmed—and renaming it aggression by omission (ABO), in contrast to aggression by commission (ABC). These studies found that both fit within a similar nomological network of antagonism, Sadism, and trait aggression. Study 2 additionally found that both were equally affected by provocation and were considered equally harmful. These findings encourage further research into ABO to capture this construct concretely, especially in the context of common paradigms (e.g., the Taylor Aggression Paradigm, Hot Sauce, Point‐Subtraction Aggression Paradigm), and trait aggression scales, which typically measure ABC.",

The aim was to verify whether sharing the same area of origin influences the relationships among heteroeolonials between and within these species which belong to the F. rufa group. The results suggest that a similar degree of agonistic behaviour (ritualised aggression) was shown in sympatric and allopatric conspecific dyads of both species studied. The interactions between F. lugubris and F. rufa were characterised by a low level of overt aggression both in sympatric and allopatric pairs, confirming the interspecific tolerance observed in our previous studies on these wood-ant species. This reduced aggressiveness between workers of F. lugubris and F. rufa coming from the same or a different area can be interpreted on the basis of their sharing common signals, such as odours and patterns of behaviour. Therefore, their mutual tolerance and acceptance can be indicative of a phylogenetic closeness between such species. We propose that an aggression test can be a valid tool for elucidating systematic problems in this taxonomically difficult group of ants. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Baseline blood samples were collected 1 week prier to the return and then at 24 hours, 1 week, and 4 weeks thereafter and hermonal and immune measurements were made. Six subjects, matched for age, sex, weight, and rank, which had remained in the social group also were evaluated. In contrast to those subjects which remained in the group (“in-group”), test subjects showed significantly higher cortisol levels and significantly lower absolute numbers of T-helper and T-suppresser cells 24 hours following return when compared to baseline values. There was a significant correlation between percent decline from baseline in absolute numbers of total T cells and total frequency of bites received during the 2 hours following return to the group (r = −0.85). Additionally, mothers of the test subjects showed a significantly greater increase in cortisol levels 24 hours following return than mothers of the in-group subjects. Finally, for the test subjects, there was near perfect negative correlation between absolute numbers of total T cells and cortisol levels 24 hours following return (r = −0.95).

    "abstract": "Immature rats are able to give maternal care to pups and may increase their inclusive fitness by helping newborn siblings. Immature males are generally reported to be more maternal than females. In this research we studied sex differences and the extent to which they may be due to a different emotional response to novelty. We studied maternal response in two groups of immature rats of both sexes: in the naive group, juveniles aged from 18 to 30 days were given one test and showed clear-cut sex differences. The experience group was submitted to repeated tests from 18 to 30 days of age, thus eliminating the effects of novelty: as a result, all differences between sexes disappeared. A second experiment was designed in 24-day-old females to differentiate the effects of repeated handling and exposure to the test situation from that of repeated exposure to pups; moreover, the effects of an anxiety-reducing drug (diazepam) were studied. Exposure to pups is particularly efficient in facilitating maternal response. Diazepam injection was also effective, but its control showed that the injection per se was responsible for the effect. In conclusion, our results stress the importance of response to novelty and suggest that sex differences in maternal behavior of immature rats may be modulated by different emotional responses by males and females. In fact, emotionality competes with, and may exert an inhibitory effect on, the expression of a vast array of behaviors. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The steroid-sensitive ultrasonic, emitted at high levels during courtship interactions, is associated with the absence of aggressive encounters and appears to be necessary for the formation and maintenance of pair-bonds with females. Interactions between unfamilliar, non-pair-bonded adult male and estrous female gerbils result in male aggression, reduction of male ultrasonic calling, and disruption of normal female dartmale follow sociosexual sequences. Castration further reduces ultrasonic calling, inhibits normal sociosexual sequences, and increses aggression in interaction between unfamiliar compared to pair-bonded individuals. Bothg brain structure and lateralization of vocal function in males depend on the action of sex steroids during sexual differentiation and in adulthood. Thus, the gerbil provides a new model to study steroid-dependent lateralization of brain mechanisms of vocal behavior mediating aggressive-sexual relationships. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

The factors assessing life orientation were lack of personal control, causal unstability, internal locus of causality, personal responsibility, and democratic educational attitudes. The mother's personal responsibility and internal causal attributions were related to nonaggressiveness in the child, whereas mothers with a lack of personal control were likely to have aggressive children. Educational attitudes were of no importance. The results showed no sex- or age-related variance.",

The study was directed toward exploring developmental trends and sex differences with respect to who was the provoker and who was provoked in the described situations. A simple classification, identical for both situational properties (provoker and provoked) was formed. The results showed that at age 18 years there was no sex difference in any of the aspects investigated. At age 12 years boys seemed to be more general than girls in their views on provokers. With increasing age the provoked in the described situations was more often someone else than the describing subject. This is interpreted as corroborating the often proposed relatedness between anger and morality.",

This paper tests Merton's theory through operationalizing anomie in terms of the degree of inequality in the distribution of income in each of the 50 states. A multiple regression analysis determines that while income inequality is significantly related to the rate of homicide, it is not significantly related to the rate of property crime. A preliminary cross-national analysis of 20 nations replicates this same general finding. The results suggest that a relatively large gap between material success and the means to success is likely to result in crimes of violence rather than property crime once we control the influence of other variables.",

Rape represents an extreme behavior which can be placed on a continuum of sexual aggression defined by degrees of coercion and force. The prevalence of sexual aggression among college students nationally was examined in 3,187 female and 2,872 male college students enrolled in 32 colleges chosen for their national diversity. A self-reporting questionnaire was administered in classes which included questions on demographics, sexual experiences before and after age 14, family and social history, current behavior, and psychological characteristics. The results indicated that 15.4 percent of college women reported experiencing legal and 4.4 percent of college men reported perpetrating legal rape. An additional 12.1 percent of women reported having experienced attempted and 3.3 percent of men reported having attempted to someone. Virtually none of these crimes were reported and thus represent hidden rape not reflected in crime statistics. Men did not admit to the levels of sexual aggression that women reported. Few women reported the crime or sought victim assistance. Rates of sexual victimizaton/aggression were robust and did not vary with school size, type of institution, location, or population size. Future research should investigate conditions which lead to this violence.

A total of 3,523 paired-male bouts for 116 male G. integer were recorded over a 2.5-year study period. Adult males used as intruders were wild-caught or laboratory reared G. integer, but for nine of the 116 experimental males, wild-caught intruders of a closely related sympathetic species, G. alogus, were used for all or many of the bouts. Bouts between male G. integer and conspecific intruders were characterized by significantly elevated levels of aggression (t=6.04, P<0.001) compared with males exposed to heterospecific G. alogus intruders in interspecific interactions. Significant differences (p<0.005, chi-squared test of independence) existed at four out of five levels in a hierarchy of agonistic behaviors. Most G. integer males exposed to both G. integer and G. alogus intruders showed significantly reduced aggression levels during the interspecific interactions (p<0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). Conspecific G. integer dyads in the intraspecific interactions showed significantly stable dominant-subordinate relationships over time. Confusion surrounding the use of the term aggression is described with reference to Arthropods in general and Orthopteran insects in particular, and some likely proximate and ultimate bases for reduced interspecific aggression in field crickets are discussed.",

The subjects were assigned to either the 80%, 50%, or 20% win conditions. Half of them were then led to judge that the power unbalance was legitimate by being informed that the assignment was based on a prior performance contest, with the good performer being assigned to the advantageous position. The other subjects were led to perceive the power imbalance as illegitimate by being informed that the assignment was randomly decided. The opponents always severely attacked them. The retaliation by the subjects was analyzed by a two-way ANOVA with Power Imbalance and Legitimacy. It was found that the subjects both in the 20% and 50% win conditions set more intense shocks to their opponents than those in the 80% win condition. This is not consistent with the fear of retaliation hypothesis which had predicted that the subjects would refrain from intensely aggressing against the opponent who had a greater aggressive capacity. It was also found that in the 80% win condition, the subjects set more intense shocks when the unbalance had been determined by their performance than when determined by luck, whereas in the 20% win condition, they set more intense shocks when the imbalance had been determined by luck than when determined by their performance. These suggest that retaliation depended upon perceived justifiability of aggression which was predicated on the legitimacy of the power imbalance. Finding in the 50% win condition that the shock settings were higher when the power imbalance had been determined by their performance than when determined by luck was interpreted in terms of their heightened competitiveness.",

Problem-solving strategies were aggregated into three broad dimensions: 1) aggressive/antisocial solutions; 2) nonverbal-nonaggressive solutions; and 3) verbal-nonaggressive solutions. Compared to ODD boys, CD boys proposed more aggressive/antisocial solutions in parent-child conflicts when parental intent was ambiguous and in teacher-child conflicts regardless of intent. Compared to ODD boys, CD boys proposed fewer verbal-nonaggressive solutions in child-child conflicts. The implications of these findings for treatment intervention with CD and ODD boys were discussed. Aggr. Behav. 23:457–469, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Study 1 compared the extent to which 8- and 11-year-old girls and boys (N = 86) participated in specific types of rough-and-tumble play. It used an observational methodology. The data were used to test two prominent hypotheses about the evolutionary function of this general category of play behaviour that have been applied to children, especially boys, of this age. One is that rough-and-tumble play provides practice for the development of real fighting skills and the other that it serves as a safe way to establish/display social dominance. Both hypotheses predict that boys will engage in more rough-and-tumble play than girls, especially those types that are used in fighting/dominance contests. Boys were found to engage in significantly more chase initiation activities, more bouts of brief rough-and-tumble play, more bouts of restraining and more bouts of boxing/hitting than girls. These data provide some support for the two hypotheses, although significant sex differences were not found for all types of rough-and-tumble play observed. No significant age differences were obtained, suggesting that the two hypotheses may be applicable throughout the 8- to 11-year-old period and not just at the end of it as previous research had suggested. Study 2 presented observational data concerning the motor patterns used in aggressive fighting. In all but one case, there were no significant differences in the extent to which 8/9- and 10/11-year-old girls and boys employed wrestling, hitting and restraining, supporting the view that the practice fighting hypothesis is relevant throughout the 8-11-year-old period. It was argued that age and sex differences provide a useful means of scrutinising functional hypotheses, and that splitting behavioural categories that contain disparate action patterns facilitates more refined tests of those hypotheses. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In addition, participants selected the acts which should be under personal jurisdiction. Participants provided reasons (i.e., justifications) to support their evaluations. The judgment evidence suggests that the moral rules were considered the most important, the transgressions the most wrong, the violators the most deserving of punishment, and the acts the least acceptable when permitted by an authority. With regard to these same dimensions, conventional rules and violations were ranked second; whereas, the personal rules were ranked third. Offender status differences were obtained for importance ratings and for deservedness of punishment. Justifications for moral events reflected reasoning from both the moral (e.g., other's welfare) and conventional (e.g., social order) domains. Reasoning about conventions involved both conventional and personal concerns; whereas, justifications about personal issues focused on individual prerogatives. The implications of these data are discussed. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Since no other behaviors monitored showed a similar increase with this manipulation, it appears that digging may be a mechanism important in the waning of muricide. Furthermore, digging may be, in some sense, a functional equivalent of killing.",

Adrenalectomy eliminated agonistic responses in animals receiving metabolites of testosterone (EB, DHT, EB+DHT) but had only slight effects in gonadally intact and T-treated, castrated mice.

    "abstract": "Abstract Isolation‐induced behavioral changes are well described in mice, although few studies have investigated the involvement of the cholinergic system in these effects. It has also been suggested that mice that display short or long attack latencies show differences in their reactions to a novel environment. The purpose of the present study was, first, to investigate locomotor activity in grouped and isolated mice that displayed short or long attack latencies and, second, to evaluate locomotor activity to determine whether it was affected interactively by differential housing and scopolamine treatment. Two experiments were performed in which NMRI mice, either isolated or group housed, were used as subjects. In the first experiment, results showed that there were no significant differences in locomotor activity between isolated mice with short and long attack latencies, although both groups were more active than grouped mice. These results indicate that motor activity in NMRI mice is influenced by housing conditions but not by levels of aggressiveness. In the second experiment it was observed that scopolamine (1 mg/kg) increased total activity counts both in isolated and group‐housed mice (both groups selected with long attack latencies), suggesting that differential housing in this strain does not substantially modify the motor effects of this dose of scopolamine.

In a first experiment, male mice were injected with lorazepam in a range of low doses (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.6 mg/kg) or saline solution. In a second experiment, 1 mg/kg of Ro 15‐1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and a saline solution were injected before the behavioral test. Results showed that 0.6 mg/kg of lorazepam was the only dose that decreased the total duration of threat ( P &lt; .01) and social investigation ( P &lt; .05) and that 1 mg/kg of Ro 15‐1788 had no effects. In the third experiment, animals received two injections: 0.6 mg/kg of lorazepam plus 1 mg/kg of Ro 15‐1788, 0.6 mg/kg of lorazepam plus saline solution, or saline solution plus saline solution. Those treated with lorazepam and saline solution spent less time digging ( P &lt; .001), threatening ( P &lt; .001), and attacking ( P &lt; .05) and more time avoiding the opponent ( P &lt; .01) or being immobile ( P &lt; .001) than the controls.

Interactions between two adult females contained the least severe agonism, whereas interactions between two immature monkeys contained the most severe agonistic behaviors. When adult females and immatures interacted agonistically, the severity of the behaviors emitted and received were related to the age of the immature monkey; the older the immature, the less severe were the agonistic behaviors.

Research on the Basque, with an emphasis on the comparison of psychological characteristics (studied by the use of an instrument developed for that purpose by the author of this article and another colleague, Jesús Guerra, of the University of the Basque Country), has provided an opportunity to review attitudes towards violence within the general population, analyze different groups constituted according to differences in attitude as well as political party vote, and to compare them with regards to differences in personality. The distribution of these attitudes within the sample population, as well as some hypotheses as to their origins, are presented, discussing their possible relationship to social and psychological variables at work within Basque society.

Bilateral adminstration of d-amphetamine (20 μg) into the central amygdaloid nucleus abolished mouse killing behavior but did not affect feeding and drinking. By contrast, bilateral amphetamine injections into the substantia nigra, or into the ventral region of the caudate nucleus, did not suppress mouse killing behavior, but significantly decreased food and water intake. The lateral hypothalamus was sensitive to d-amphetamine injections, which suppressed mouse killing and food intake as well as water intake. d-Amphetamine injections into the nucleus accumbens produced inconsistent effects on mouse killing and feeding. Our observations suggest a differentiation of the neural sites that mediate feeding from those underlying mouse killing behavior.",

We studied whether worker size and size difference between opponents had an effect on aggression during conspecific encounters. Although the capacity to recognize nestmates was shared by all individuals, some patterns of agonistic behaviors were size related. Escape was mostly displayed by the small workers, and threat, associated with ritualized fights, by the large workers. As game theory predicted, ants of C. niger adjusted their level of aggression as a function of the size of the opponent. However, only large individuals used such assessment strategies, responding with escalation of aggression towards small workers and reduction of aggression towards large ones. On the contrary, small individuals behaved in the same manner whatever the opponent's size. Differences between both morphological castes were discussed with reference to the resource holding assessment models. Aggr. Behav. 25:369–379, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aggressive behavior is generally detrimental to children's friendships, both in terms of having friends and in terms of keeping friends. Despite this general tendency, many aggressive children have friends and some of these friendships are stable. We examined the moderating role of preference norms in the classroom and child's sex in the association between children's physical and relational aggression and their friendship experiences. A total of 1135 children ( M = 10.24 years, SD = 1.01) in Grades 4 to 6 completed a peer nomination inventory in the Fall (T1) and Spring (T2) of the same school year. Norms were operationalized as the class‐ and sex‐specific correlation between physical or relational aggression and social preference. Norms moderated associations between each form of aggression and number of friends. At T1, physical and relational aggression were concurrently associated with having more friends when norms favored this behavior and with fewer friends when norms were unfavorable. The latter effect was especially pronounced in girls. Over time, youth lost friends when norms favored physical aggression and gained friends when norms favored relational aggression. T1 friends' physical and relational aggression were strong predictors of new friends' aggressive behavior, suggesting that friends provide a type of norm more significant to new friend selection than norms of the peer group and individual aggressive behavior. Overall, our results suggest that physical and relational aggression are not necessarily detrimental to children's friendship experiences and may even be beneficial in specific social contexts.",

This study examined the effects of different concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg) of 8‐OH‐DPAT, a selective 5‐HT 1A receptor agonist, on the aggressive behavior of juvenile pufferfish. Forty‐five minutes after drug injection, the aggressive behavior of juvenile fish was recorded for 20 min, including the latency to the first attack and the frequency of aggressive behaviors. The results showed no significant differences in the latency to the first attack of juvenile fish among treatment groups. During the first 10 min of the observation period, there was no significant difference in the total aggressive acts and locomotor activity among treatment groups. Total aggressive acts and locomotor activity were the least in the 1 mg/kg 8‐OH‐DPAT‐treated during the 20 min observation period. Both aggressive behavior and locomotor activity were negatively correlated with 8‐OH‐DPAT treatment overall, respectively. The above results suggested that the serotonergic system activation had suppressive effects on aggressive behavior and locomotor activity in juvenile pufferfish.",

Ninety animals were used, 30 randomly selected and 60 selected because of their clear dominance or submission. Each condition (dominant, submissive, and random) was distributed in three subgroups corresponding to the triadic design. The test consisted of an escape/avoidance task. The results showed that the animals in the uncontrollable condition performed worse than those in the controllable and no treatment conditions. Social submission and dominance reduced vulnerability of the subjects against learned helplessness. Submission had a facilitating effect on subsequent learning, independently of whether pretreatment was controllability or uncontrollability. Learned mastery was observed in the submissive condition, because submission benefited the subjects in the controllable condition in comparison with the untreated subjects, and dominance impaired the subjects in the controllable condition.

Motor patterns directed from one individual to another were discriminated and grouped into five categories of behavior ordered according to their relative likelihoods of “damaging aggression” [Fagen, American Naturalist, 115:858–869, 1980]. Transfers generally occurred between two females of different reproductive conditions. Most interactions were directed from the holder of the infant to the infant, demonstrating that the infant is the recipient of most nondamaging as well as potentially damaging behavior. While transfers are characterized by “aggressive restraint,” the least damaging behavior is most likely to precede a transfer and may function to prolong the relative duration of infant holding. Behavior with a relatively high likelihood of damage to the infant by the infant holder is as likely to occur before as after transfer, suggesting that infant transfer behavior in this human society reflects competitive interactions among adult females.",

It was found that prior to chronic drug treatment, in study 1, 0.50 g/kg of EtOH increased both aggressive behavior and time spent interacting with the stimulus juvenile male from the first presentation of the juvenile to the second presentation (20 min apart) while saline injection decreased it. After chronic drug treatment was ended, in study 1 animals treated chronically with EtOH were more aggressive when they were not intoxicated than when they had been treated with 0.50 g/kg of EtOH. In studies 2 and 3, after chronic drug treatment was ended, aggressive behavior and time spent interacting with the juvenile were greater in the animals treated chronically with EtOH, regardless of whether they were injected with saline or 0.50 g/kg of EtOH. The results of these studies showed that chronic EtOH treatment can produce long-lasting changes in social behavior after drug treatment is over and can alter the animal's normal response to EtOH in a social setting.",

Despite numerous evidence‐based programs that reduce youth violence, objective ways to identify youth in need of services is lacking. Few screening tools are available that enables practitioners or community organizations to predict who may perpetrate serious violence. The Violence Injury Protection and Risk Screen (VIPRS) is a previously validated screening tool providing a framework to address youth violence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the VIPRS in a community sample for use in multiple settings. Youth participating in a community‐focused youth violence prevention intervention served as the study subjects. Households with youth ages 10−17 were eligible to participate. Study personnel verbally asked youth survey questions and recorded answers on a laptop. Multiple measures—including risk factors for violent behavior as well as, violence and delinquency scales, were asked. Eleven hundred youth participated. Mean age was 13.3; 53% female, 26% Black, 58% Hispanic, 11% more than 1 race. Twenty percent screened positive on the VIPRS—28% male versus 13% female ( p = .000). Violence‐related behaviors were common: 33% were in a physical fight, 27% experienced cyberbullying victimization, and 9% perpetrated a minor assault. The VIPRS demonstrated robust criterion validity with significant correlation to multiple violence measures (0.3−0.6). Scoring positive on the VIPRS conveyed increased odds of reporting other violent behaviors, such as perpetrating physical aggression (OR: 7 [95% CI: 5.1−11.5]). Overall, the VIPRS performed well in a community sample of youth further validating its psychometric functioning while demonstrating the potential for use in settings beyond healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Peer victimization typically peaks in early adolescence, leading researchers to hypothesize that pubertal timing is a meaningful predictor of peer victimization. However, previous methodological approaches have limited our ability to parse out which puberty cues are associated with peer victimization because gonadal and adrenal puberty, two independent processes, have either been conflated or adrenal puberty timing has been ignored. In addition, previous research has overlooked the possibility of reverse causality-that peer victimization might drive pubertal timing, as it has been shown to do in non-human primates. To fill these gaps, we followed 265 adolescents (47% female) prospectively across three-time points (Mage : T1 = 9.6, T2 = 12.0, T3 = 14.4) and measured self-report peer victimization and self- and maternal-report of gonadal and adrenal pubertal development on the Pubertal Development Scale. Multilevel modeling revealed that females who were further along in adrenal puberty at age 9 were more likely to report peer victimization at age 12 (Cohen's d = 0.25, p = .005). The relation between gonadal puberty status and peer victimization was not significant for either sex. In terms of the reverse direction, the relation between early peer victimization and later pubertal development was not significant in either sex. Overall, our findings suggest that adrenal puberty status, but not gonadal puberty status, predicted peer victimization in females, highlighting the need to separate gonadal and adrenal pubertal processes in future studies.",

This study begins to address this gap by exploring the moderating effects of provisional PTSD diagnosis on the relation between heavy alcohol consumption and physical IPV using a multilevel modeling approach. Participants were adult romantic couples ( N = 100) with current AUD and a history of physical IPV in their relationship. Results from the between‐couple comparison indicate that couples who reported more heavy drinking days also experienced more physical IPV when at least one partner had probable PTSD. However, the within‐couple comparison indicated that among partners without a provisional PTSD diagnosis, those with fewer heavy drinking days compared to their partner also reported more physical IPV perpetration. These preliminary and exploratory findings require replication and extension but provide new and important information regarding the complex intersection of heavy drinking, PTSD, and IPV among couples with AUD.",

Investigating associations between psychopathology dimensions and aggression helps further understanding about the etiology of aggression, and ultimately, can inform intervention and prevention strategies. This study adopted a multi‐method approach to examine associations between internalizing and externalizing dimensions of psychopathology and self‐ and other‐directed aggression as a function of reporter (participant and informant) and modality of aggression measurement (subjective and objective). Participants were an unselected sample of 151 racially diverse adults recruited from the community. Dimensions of psychopathology were assessed using interview and questionnaire reports from participants and collateral informants, and forms of aggression were measured via subjective reports and an objective, laboratory aggression paradigm. Analyses of participant‐reported psychological symptom data consistently linked externalizing symptoms to other‐directed aggression, and internalizing symptoms to self‐directed aggression. Results across informant and participant reporters replicated prior findings showing a significant interaction between internalizing and externalizing dimensions in predicting intimate partner violence. Most other effects in informant models were nonsignificant. The findings uncover consistency in and replicability of relationships between dimensions of psychopathology and certain manifestations of aggression and highlight the importance of examining multiple forms of aggression in etiological research. Examining aggression through a transdiagnostic lens can help us better understand and intervene upon processes implicated in devasting forms of self‐ and other‐directed aggression.",

The goal this study was to test whether difficulties regulating emotions moderated the association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and aggression in a community sample of predominantly Black females with high levels of trauma exposure. Furthermore, we explored unique relations between PTSD symptom clusters and distinct subscales of difficulties regulating emotions and aggression. The sample included 601 community participants recruited from an urban public hospital. Symptoms were assessed using self‐report measures including the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Behavioral Questionnaire‐Short. Regression analyses were conducted using PTSD symptoms and total DERS to test their interaction as predictors for aggression (using BQ‐Short). We found that higher levels of PTSD arousal symptoms and difficulty controlling impulses when upset were positively related to aggression. We also conducted an exploratory analysis to examine the association between PTSD symptom clusters using the Alternative Symptom Clusters hybrid model. The results suggest that some PTSD symptoms (externalizing behavior) and some emotion dysregulation processes (difficulties controlling impulses when upset), relate to aggression in independent, rather than multiplicative ways. These results offer insights for new directions of research that focuses on the independent association between specific emotion dysregulation processes and PTSD symptoms on aggression.",

While predictors of contest outcome and dominance are increasingly studied, we have a poor understanding of how they vary across populations. Here, I use the widely distributed Australian agamid lizard, the Jacky dragon ( Amphibolurus muricatus ), to quantify variation in features predicting contest outcome among males of different populations. I measured physical attributes, maximal physiological performance capacity (sprint speed, endurance, bite force) and visual displays during staged encounters. I found that morphology, performance capacity and the type and frequency of visual displays used during agonistic interactions varied significantly across populations. Contest winners from the Cann River State Forest population favored tail‐flicks and push‐up/body‐rocks, while those from Royal National Park were more likely to chase and individuals from Yarratt State Forest performed more bite‐lunges than other populations. The losers of contests also differed in their displays. Individuals from the Cann River population were dominant over the others based on behavioral attributes (i.e., aggressive visual displays, chases and bite‐lunges). I suggest that population differences in signal form and function could have implications for range dynamics as populations come into contact in an era of rapid environmental change.",

Recurrent, unplanned aggressive behavior is the core diagnostic criterion for intermittent explosive disorder (IED). In this study, we compared two behavioral measures of aggression in the laboratory: the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) and the Point‐Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). This sample ( n = 528) included community participants who met DSM‐5 criteria for IED ( n = 156), met DSM‐5 criteria for a nonaggressive psychiatric disorder ( n = 205), or did not meet DSM‐5 criteria for any psychiatric disorder ( n = 167). All participants completed the TAP, a single‐session PSAP, and relevant self‐report measures. MANOVA analyses demonstrated differences between IED participants and nonaggressive participants; however, these group differences were no longer significant for the PSAP after including demographic variables. Correlation analyses found that the TAP and PSAP were positively related to one another and the composite variables associated with aggressive behavior (i.e., history of aggression, impulsivity, and propensity to experience anger) and; dependent correlations revealed that past aggression and trait anger were more strongly related to the TAP. Differences in TAP and PSAP outcomes may be partially attributed to operationalizations of aggression and methods of aggression and provocation. Further, as aggressive and nonaggressive participants differed on the PSAP somewhat mirroring the TAP, our results add to growing evidence of the validity of a single‐session PSAP; further research is needed to fully establish single‐session PSAP as a laboratory aggression task compared to the multi‐session PSAP.",

We then examined their associations with explicit (e.g., assessed with self‐report) attitudes toward violence and self‐reported violent behavior in a combined sample of males from a Canadian university and males from the general community ( N = 251; 156 students and 95 community members). To date, there have been mixed findings regarding these associations; some of this inconsistency may be due to the difficulty in accurately conceptualizing and assessing implicit attitudes toward violence. Therefore, we administered three response latency measures to assess this construct: a violence evaluation implicit association test (VE‐IAT), a personalized VE‐IAT (P‐VE‐IAT), and a violence evaluation relational responding task, along with three self‐report measures of explicit attitudes toward violence and three self‐report measures of violent behavior. More positive implicit attitudes toward violence were related to more positive explicit attitudes toward violence (for VE‐IAT and P‐VE‐IAT; r = 0.18 to 0.22), greater likelihood of violence (for VE‐IAT; r = 0.18 and for P‐VE‐IAT; r = 0.16), and greater propensity for violence (for the VE‐IAT; r = 0.16). All measures of explicit attitudes toward violence and violent behavior were moderately to strongly associated with one another ( r = 0.42 to 0.81). Furthermore, implicit attitudes toward violence explained additional variance in some violent outcomes above explicit attitudes alone. Our findings suggest that scores on certain reaction time measures are important for understanding likelihood and propensity for violence, especially when combined with explicit attitude measures.",

Therefore, we aimed to understand the social characteristics and mental health correlates of indirect aggression by combining perspectives from developmental psychopathology and evolutionary psychology. We examined: (1) whether social characteristics (social comparison, hypercompetitiveness) contributed to indirect aggression (perpetration, victimization) and (2) whether there were indirect effects from indirect aggression (perpetration, victimization) to mental health difficulties through loneliness. In a cross‐sectional sample of 475 young adults (57.7% women, 51.6% White, M age = 20.2, SD age = 2.18), path analyses revealed that social comparison predicted indirect aggression victimization, which indirectly predicted mental health difficulties (depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms) through loneliness. In contrast, indirect aggression perpetration was only predicted by hypercompetitiveness. The findings highlight that reframing cognitions associated with social comparison could help prevent indirect aggression and mental health difficulties among young people.",

Therefore, the current study tested an intervention in which victims in experimental classrooms were seated far away from their bullies and next to their best friends, whereas a random seating arrangement was implemented in control classrooms. The underlying reasoning was that victims would experience a sense of safety next to their best friend and to limit bullies' opportunities to harass the victim.

Two hundred and thirty‐two participants reported their three most frequently played video games and the amount of time each game was played in a typical week. Next, they completed an assessment of emotion‐induced blindness, which refers to a reduction in the correct identification of a neutral target image when it follows an emotionally charged distractor image. The primary findings showed that weekly violent video game play was negatively associated with target identification following nonviolent interpersonal conflict images, but not violent images. Findings are discussed in terms of the saliency of threatening images and attentional processing.",

Fillon et al. (2024) challenged our findings, alleging methodological errors and an excessive degree of researcher flexibility, which they claim could lead to false‐positive results. In this response, we critically examine Fillon et al.'s commentary, arguing that it exemplifies flawed meta‐scientific critique. We demonstrate that their approach relies on a series of unsupported and misleading claims, including a misinterpretation of the literature, unjustified reliance on visual data inspection, speculative assumptions about religious influences on our findings, and a shifting of the burden of proof. Through rigorous re‐analyses, we reaffirm the robustness of our original results and address the unfounded allegations regarding our methodological practices. We also critique Fillon et al.'s approach, highlighting the necessity of domain‐specific expertize in meta‐scientific evaluations and cautioning against the risks of speculative and defamatory criticism in academic discourse. This exchange underscores the importance of maintaining rigorous standards in both original research and its critique, ensuring that scientific debate remains grounded in evidence rather than conjecture.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Spitefulness has been defined as the willingness to cause some kind of harm to other people, even if this action does not bring any benefit and causes harm to herself. Given its relationship with a multitude of antisocial behaviors, interest in studying this trait has been growing and it was in 2014 when the first scale to measure it was validated: the Spitefulness Scale. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of its Spanish version. In a sample of 758 participants ( M = 31.44; SD = 12.91; 72.80% female), the Spitefulness Scale, the Short Dark Triad, the Assessment of Sadistic Personality, the HEXACO‐60, and the Global Assessment of Internet Trolling were administered. Results showed the unidimensionality of the scale, adequate reliability indices, and construct validity, evidenced by positive relationships with the Dark Tetrad traits and trolling behavior. Additionally, the analysis revealed significant gender differences, with males scoring higher on spitefulness. This Spanish validation allows us to establish a solid basis for cross‐cultural comparisons. Understanding this trait, considered like the Dark Tetrad traits an antagonistic personality trait, has important implications for understanding the interpersonal and social dynamics. Given that spitefulness is closely related to aggressive behaviors, it is essential to study it to understand the underlying mechanisms of aggression and hostility in social interactions.",

Across all studies, self‐reported positive affect was higher, whereas self‐reported negative affect was lower after an instance of revenge. Furthermore, the revenge‐related positive affect predicted greater subsequent vengeful and benevolent motivations toward the provocateur (but more consistently the former). These findings replicate and extend previous research on affect‐improving qualities of revenge. They allow for a more nuanced understanding of the reinforcing nature of vengeful pleasure. Moreover, they suggest that the pleasure of revenge might be harnessed to promote forgiveness.",

Two hundred thirty heterosexual couples (total n = 460) participated in a dyadic design study. Both partners answered a questionnaire about online violence, hostile sexism, and anxious attachment. Results show that both members' hostile sexism positively correlates with the perpetration and victimization of online violence in boys and girls, but not in all the dimensions. However, actor‐hostile sexism has a greater effect on both perpetration and victimization for both members than partner‐hostile sexism, except for control perpetration and victimization of girls. Results also show that the actor‐anxious attachment positively moderated the relationship between their hostile sexism and perpetration and victimization for both members, only when it was higher than average, and negatively when it was lower. In girls, when the anxious attachment is high, the relationship between the boys' hostile sexism and the girls' direct aggression perpetration becomes weaker. The opposite occurs between the boys' hostile sexism and boys' direct aggression perpetrated when their girlfriends' anxious attachment increases. In sum, anxious attachment and hostile actor and partner sexism play an important role in online violence in adolescent couples. Therefore, the protective effect of low levels of anxious attachment should be studied among other psychosocial factors and online violence.",

This study aims to identify the average trajectory of partner maltreatment over a 5-month period before applying an attachment-informed diathesis-stress framework to explain points of escalation or de-escalation in partner maltreatment perpetration. Two hundred and eight individuals completed 5 monthly assessments of partner maltreatment as well as an assessment of adult attachment and perceived stress at baseline. A nonlinear (i.e., quadratic function) trajectory provided optimal fit for partner maltreatment perpetration over time. An interaction between attachment avoidance and perceived stress predicted the trajectory of partner maltreatment perpetration. Specifically, higher attachment avoidance and higher perceived stress predicted a small initial decline followed by a steep increase in partner maltreatment perpetration. No significant associations were found for the interaction between attachment anxiety and stress and partner maltreatment. The findings suggest that perpetration of partner maltreatment fluctuates over time, and that an attachment-informed diathesis-stress framework can be applied to explain levels of partner maltreatment perpetration and points of escalation and de-escalation over time.",

This study, conducted in Chile, investigated the socio-cognitive processes inherent to the relationship between child abuse and ADV perpetration by examining the association between child abuse, impulsivity, reactive aggression, proactive aggression, attitudes that rationalize or justify ADV, and actual ADV perpetration. Data were collected from 655 adolescents using self-reported measures of child abuse, impulsivity, reactive and proactive aggression, attitudes justifying ADV, and ADV perpetration using structural equation modeling. Having experienced child abuse predicted higher levels of impulsivity, which in turn predicted higher levels of aggressive traits, both for reactive and proactive aggression. Proactive aggression predicted higher levels of ADV perpetration, whereas reactive aggression did not. While we did not find that child abuse predicted a greater propensity for ADV, nor that such a disposition indicated a higher level of proactive aggression by influencing ADV perpetration, we did find that a positive attitude toward ADV predicted a higher frequency of ADV perpetration. Our results suggest that the socio-cognitive process underlying ADV involves automatic and complex processes stemming from child abuse, thus linking environmental and individual factors.",

Multimodal signaling, the use of multiple sensory systems is crucial in this process, but little is known about the relative importance of different senses used during aggression. We used the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, to test how visual and chemosensory signals in male-male interactions influence behavior. Males of this species exist in a dominance hierarchy, where brightly colored dominant individuals aggressively defend territories for reproductive activities. Focal males were presented with visual and chemosensory signals from other males either alone (unimodal) or together (bimodal). We found that vision is necessary for males to engage in aggressive behaviors such as frontal displays, lateral displays, and border fights. While chemical signals alone did not evoke aggressive behaviors, we find slight reductions of some aggressive behaviors when bimodal stimuli are provided. This study is the first to examine how visual-chemosensory signaling impacts male-male aggressive behavior in A. burtoni and provides insight on how these signaling modalities mediate territorial interactions.",

This study aimed to address this gap by examining these relationships over 1 year, focusing on the roles of collective efficacy and self‐concept at both the classroom and individual levels. A sample of 1053 elementary school students in grades 4–6 across 36 classes completed questionnaires, and a multilevel moderated mediation model was constructed. After controlling for gender and grade, the study found: (1) The association between friendship quality and victimization was the strongest, followed by peer acceptance and peer rejection, with no significant difference between the latter two. (2) Peer acceptance was related to victimization entirely through self‐concept, while peer rejection was directly related to victimization. Friendship quality was primarily related to victimization directly rather than through self‐concept. (3) Collective efficacy was negatively related to victimization and moderated the relationships between peer rejection, friendship quality, and victimization. Higher collective efficacy reduced the association between peer rejection and victimization but diminished the protective effect of friendship quality on victimization. This study not only clarified the specific roles and pathways of peer acceptance, peer rejection, and friendship quality in relation to victimization but also highlighted the protective role of peer interactions at the classroom level, enhancing our understanding of victimization dynamics.",

The purpose of this study was: (1) to establish other ways that attack and feeding were connected besides the two effects already mentioned; and (2) to determine if caching of dead prey could account for the limited connection between attack and feeding. Experiment 1 showed that attack and feeding were connected as part of a reaction chain. Experiment 2 showed that both shared a common maturational process despite the fact that each response achieved an improved efficiency in a different way. Experiment 3 showed that caching prey was not correlated with the killing of a prey and thus could not account for the limited connection between attack and feeding. It is proposed that a highly canalized attack response specifically buffered against the effects of feeding and hunger plays an important role in the mouse's carnivorous life style.",

The Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Vol 9, Part I, Para 3.” London: Routledge] theory of archetypes functioning as components of the human collective unconscious. Jungian formulations involve a phylogenetic view of psychic phenomena since archetypes are conceived as neuropsychic entities which evolved through natural selection. It is argued that the banding together of young males for the purpose of aggressive pursuits such as hunting, intergroup conflict, and warfare is a biologically transmitted propensity mediated by archetypal structures in the human brain-psyche. Universally apparent patterns of affiliative and hostile behaviors are linked to Chance's [(1988): “Social Fabrics of the Mind.” London: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates] hedonic and agonic modes and seen as later ontological expressions of archetypal structures responsible in childhood for formation of bonds of attachment to familiars and avoidance and wariness of strangers. Erikson's [(1984): Yale Review 73(4): 481–486] concept of pseudospeciation is associated with Jung's concept of shadow projection to elucidate the phenomena of patriotism, xenophobia, national paranoia, Lorenz's [(1966): “On Aggression.” London: Methuen & Co.] “militant enthusiasm,” propaganda, and mobilization for war. Finally, it is argued that peace between nations can be promoted through conscious awareness of archetypally determined patterns of intergroup conflict and a collective resolve not to pseudospeciate our neighbors. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Male mice of the CF-1 strain (Mus musculus) were allowed to take up lone residence in a small territory consisting of a 60-cm enclosure attached by a tubular runway to a standard mouse cage with food, water, and bedding. A group of ten mice, each of which resided in its own separate enclosure for 24 hours, were more aggressive toward intruders than other groups of ten mice following six-hour residence periods, or no such residence. Aggression toward intruders increased in repeated weekly tests of the six-hour residents, but after four weeks of testing did not reach the maximum stable level displayed by the 24-hour residents over four weeks of testing. In another experiment, the 24-hour residence period of groups of 20 CF-1 male mice was disturbed by briefly removing the mouse from the enclosure, before introducing the intruder, at various intervals prior to testing. Removal of the resident five minutes before testing resulted in a marked decrease in aggression toward intruders. Although lesser decreases in aggression followed intervals of 30, 45, and 60 minutes, a 180 minute interval resulted in no appreciable effects compared to undisturbed controls. It is concluded that exposure to the stimuli provided by the enclosure results in an aggressive readiness in the resident mouse which reaches a high level within a 24-hour period.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the technical difficulties involved in the study of human violence, theoretical attempts at understanding it run into two major obstacles. One is the psychological problem of gaining distance from the human emotions involved. The other is the ideological problem of viewing violence in its historical and social context. This article points to the limitations of some of the current approaches to human violence, and presents one approach which offers a more realistic and more comprehensive way of looking at human violence. The objectivization and quantification of behavior aims at gaining a phenomenological and an ideological distance from it. In the case of human aggression, analogies from animal behavior may serve a similar function. The article advocates dealing with violence in its phenomenological, social, and historical context, and presents the contribution of Frantz Fanon to the understanding of one particular historical situation as a relevant model. Fanon analyzed violence in the Algerian war for independence from a phenomenological-psychohistorical viewpoint, and his analysis may serve as a model of working within the human context. Efforts in this direction should lead to a more humanistic and a more comprehensive view of human violence.",

In HLA colonies most of the attacks on the aliens were by the dominant; in LLA colonies there was no difference in the behavior of dominant and subordinate mice toward strangers. Both aggression toward aliens and intracolony aggression declined over the 8 day experimental period. In HLA colonies the dominant mouse mounted females 5 times more frequently than did either his subordinates or male mice in the LLA colonies. In HLA colonies aliens huddled with subordinates to form a single colony with 1 dominant and 7 subordinates. In LLA colonies alien males remained as a discrete group spatially separated in the cage. Female aliens were incorporated into the main colony. In all cases dominant male mice made more attacks on aliens as compared with familiar mice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between race and violence in the context of professional baseball. Specifically, I used the number of times a batter was hit by a pitch (per plate appearance) as an indicator of being the victim of an indirect violent act. Archival data were gathered from 4,273 players from 1950 to 1997, yielding 27,022 individual records. Even after controlling for player ability and league rules, race was a significant predictor of being hit. Specifically, from 1950 to 1997, the rate at which Blacks were hit was approximately 7.5% greater than the rate for Whites. The rate at which Hispanics were hit was approximately 7.6% greater than the rate for Whites. Testing year as a moderator revealed that the Black‐White difference was much greater in the 1950s and 1960s. From 1970 to 1989, race was not a significant predictor of being hit. Contrary to the hypotheses, from 1990 to 1997, Whites and Hispanics were hit at a significantly higher rate than Blacks (23.0% and 29.0%, respectively). Additional analyses revealed no relationship between pitcher race and batter race in hit‐by‐pitch events from 1997 to 1999. The findings are discussed with respect to group threat theory and the distinction between covert and overt aggression. Aggr. Behav. 28:109–116, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Each of 19 breeding groups comprised one adult male and from four to six adult females. The HI was determined for each female and all aggressive interactions were recorded. These were recorded while the male was present (i.e., all of Trial 1 and the “with male” period in Trial 2) and after removal of the male (i.e., the “without male” period in Trial 2). The individual percentage change in the frequency of aggressive interactions after male removal was calculated. In Trial 1 the HI, the frequency of different types of aggressive interaction and the total of aggressive interactions were positively related (all: p &lt; .001; General Linear Mixed Model [GLMM]). In Trial 2, the frequency of total aggressive interactions increased after male removal ( F (1, 27) = 3.5; p &lt; .001; GLMM). The individual percentage changes in aggressive interaction between periods were positively related to HI ( F (6, 24) = 2.56; p = .05; GLMM). For female pampas deer maintained in breeding groups, we conclude that the frequency of aggressive interactions increases within the hierarchy. Aggression also increases after the short‐term removal of the male, mainly among females of higher social status.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cyberaggression (CA), or the use of information communication technologies to inflict harm on others, is an emerging public health crisis. Unfortunately, our current ability to assess CA in a research context remains limited, curtailing efforts to address this important issue. We sought to fill this gap in the literature by developing an adapted “chat” version of the Taylor aggression paradigm (TAP) that would more closely resemble a social gaming format (hereafter referred to as the TAP‐Chat). In the TAP‐Chat, participants have a chat function available to communicate with their (fictitious) co‐player. Following loss trials in a competitive reaction time task, they receive a “mean chat” from their co‐player. Participant messages to their (fictitious) co‐player are then coded for aggressive content by a team of trained research assistants, and via automated linguistic analysis software (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count). The current study evaluated the predictive utility of the TAP‐Chat task in independent discovery and replication samples ( N = 843 and N = 350, respectively). Participants’ publicly available tweets served as an important external criterion variable, along with a handful of self‐report questionnaires assessing CA and related constructs. Analyses suggest that, although it can be completed in ∼13 min, the TAP‐Chat predicts CA on Twitter and, to a lesser extent, as reported on questionnaires. Although there are still several issues to address, it is our hope that the research community will benefit from this straightforward behavioral assessment of CA.",

Yet, few reliable risk factors for aggression and violence in girls and women have been identified. Although preliminary evidence suggests peer relationships may be central to the development of youth conduct problems, especially in girls, rigorous interactive models of peer risk and protective factors for conduct problems are lacking. Based on 3104 10−13‐year‐old girls in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study, we tested the independent associations of separate peer risk factors (i.e., relational aggression victimization, physical aggression victimization, and deviant peer affiliation) with multidimensional conduct problems, including their moderation by peer support. Being the victim of relational aggression, being the victim of physical aggression, and deviant peer affiliation were each positively associated with conduct problems and perpetration of aggression whereas peer support was negatively associated with youth report conduct problems and perpetration of physical aggression. Further, elevated peer support significantly attenuated the association of being the victim of relational aggression with teacher‐rated conduct problems. These results highlight the sensitivity of conduct problems to peer risk factors and suggest that peer support designates important configurations of risk that differentially relate to conduct problems in girls.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning has been proposed as a relevant method to characterize the therapeutic needs of intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators. Nevertheless, research has neglected the influence of the ANS on socio‐affective functions in this population. The aim of the present study was to analyze the psychophysiological activity of IPV perpetrators ( n = 52) compared to controls ( n = 46) following an empathic induction task, performed through negative emotion‐eliciting videos. We employed two general ANS markers (heart rate [HR] and respiratory rate [RR]), two sympathetic‐related indexes (pre‐ejection period [PEP] and skin conductance level [SCL]) and a parasympathetic biomarker (respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA]). Additionally, we explored the impact of psychophysiological activity on prosocial behavior using Hare's donation procedure. Compared to controls, IPV perpetrators reported lower HR and SCL following the task, as well as longer PEP, suggesting an attenuated sympathetic response to others' distress. No differences in the RSA response pattern were found, however, IPV perpetrators displayed lower overall RSA levels throughout the protocol, indicative of reduced parasympathetic activity. Besides, while no differences in prosocial performance were observed, greater sympathetic responses and overall parasympathetic activity predicted increased donations across the sample. Thus, a high sympathetic and parasympathetic activity might influence the occurrence of prosocial behavior. The present study provides further evidence supporting that IPV perpetrators cope differently with others' negative emotions. In line with this biopsychosocial perspective, insights are gained on the emotional processing of IPV perpetrators which, in turn, could contribute to improve IPV psychotherapeutic programs.",

We found evidence for the configural, metric, and scalar measurement invariance—a requirement needed to make a meaningful comparison between aggression means across gender, age groups, and time. When comparing means for boys and girls, gender differences emerged earlier for unprovoked than provoked aggression. Also, the frequency of provoked aggression increased among younger, but not older, toddlers. By developing a brief parental report of aggression in toddlerhood, we hope to fill a void of early aggression measures that tap the contextual variability in aggressive behaviors, and thereby stimulate more research to further our understanding of different types of aggression and their correlates in toddlerhood.",

This paper examines the relationship between negative affect, hostile attribution, dominance, empathy, self‐evaluations, and exposure to workplace aggression among emergency responders. Emergency medical workers, firefighters and police officers in the Netherlands filled in a survey during three measurement occasions (6 months apart). Results from the three occupational groups were presented separately. Results suggest that some psychological characteristics are related to exposure to workplace aggression, but that the contribution of these characteristics in the explanation of exposure to workplace aggression is limited. In addition, although differences between occupational groups could not be statistically tested due to differences in the factor structure of exposure to workplace aggression between the three groups of emergency response, differences seem to occur in models between emergency response contexts. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

We conducted a three‐wave longitudinal survey with 1058 undergraduates (63.61% women; mean age = 20.97). The results of the random intercept cross‐lagged panel model showed that personal relative deprivation at Wave 1 and hostility at Wave 2 formed a serial effect on the within‐person changes in civic moral disengagement at Wave 3, and the longitudinal indirect effect test showed that the within‐person dynamics in hostility at Wave 2 acted as a mediator. The results of multiple group analysis across genders further showed that the longitudinal indirect role of hostility at Wave 2 was only observed for men, but not for women, which indicates the moderating effect of gender.

    "abstract": "Abstract There is accumulating longitudinal evidence that popularity predicts relative increases in adolescents' aggression. Yet, we know very little about the conditions that motivate popular youth to engage in coercive behaviors. In this study, we evaluated whether popular adolescents would show elevated levels of aggression over time when they felt powerless and had low prestige (respect and admiration) among their peers. In addition, we examined whether popular youth would gain a greater sense of power and prestige over time via aggressive means. Participants were 419 fifth ( M agetT1 = 10.91 years, SD = 0.42) and eighth graders ( M agetT1 = 13.95 years, SD = 0.43) who participated twice over a 1‐year interval. Popularity was measured at Time 1, while the other central constructs, such as direct forms of aggression, sense of power and prestige, were assessed at Times 1 and 2. Our findings demonstrate that aggression might be a threat‐triggered response by popular youth to protect their ego and/or resolve the discrepancy between their position in the hierarchy and what that role should afford them. Moreover, popular youth feel the greatest sense of power over time when they abstain from resorting to aggressive means. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Bystanders play an important role in cyberbullying, yet the majority of bystanders remain silent as outsiders. To date, research on the measurement and influencing factors of outsider behavior in the context of cyberbullying is lacking. This research first adapted a valid and reliable instrument to measure this construct and then examined its influencing factors based on the arousal: cost‐reward model. In Study 1, a total of 901 participants (55% female, mean age = 20.84) were randomly divided into two subsamples: one for exploratory factor analysis ( n = 450) and the other for confirmatory factor analysis ( n = 451). The final eight‐item measurement had good reliability and validity with a three‐factor structure of self‐disengagement, cautious avoidance, and victim blaming. Study 2 investigated the relationships among the severity of cyberbullying incidents, empathic concern, cost for help, and outsider behavior. Among 331 participants (57% female, mean age = 21.08), 168 participants were randomly assigned to the high‐severity group. Results found that the severity has indirect effects on the three outsider behavioral orientations through the empathic concern. Severity also has indirect effects on outsider behaviors of cautious avoidance and victim blaming through the influence of empathic concern on cost for help.",

A paper by Santiago Genoves, a Mexican anthropologist, outlined some of the issues concerning the dissemination of information and misinformation of aggression to the public, along with an extensive bibliography on the subject. A paper by Paul Brain, a British zoologist, addressed the issues surrounding the use of animals in aggression research and the arguments being used in public attacks upon it. Daniel Wikler, a practitioner of normative ethics from the United States, discussed ethics as theory and as practice and suggested some of the types of actions that the Society could consider undertaking.",

Cocaine treatment alone reduced the overall level of aggression in dyads, and in interaction with genotype or the standard tester it altered the behavior of dyads in all phases of social interaction: the initiation, content, and outcome. Standard testers used as behavioral probes, differentiated cocaine and control males with respect to their stimulus and behavioral qualities. Aggr. Behav. 23:183–196, 1997.© 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to clarify the connection between aggressive and sexual behavior with the aid of testosterone propionate (TP) and parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA). Previous studies have indicated that aggressive and sexual behavior are positively correlated, and it has been suggested that both behaviors are related to the level of general arousal. Testosterone has documented effects on both aggressive and sexual behavior. It has been hypothesized that these effects are due to an increased level of general arousal. If this is the case, aggressive and sexual behavior could be restored by administration of drugs excitating the central nervous system, e.g., PCPA. The present study examined the effects of TP and PCPA on aggressive and sexual behavior in gonadectomized male mice. Control animals were injected with sesame seed oil or saline. The level of aggressiveness was assessed by means of dyadic tests with gonad-intact male opponents. For the sexuality tests, a receptive female was placed in the home cage of the experimental male. The results showed that male mice injected with PCPA were more aggressive than the males of the other groups, while the TP-exposed males expressed the most sexual activity. Compared to the control group, the PCPA and TP groups were more active in both the aggression and the sexuality tests. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that the earlier documented correlations between aggressive and sexual behavior could be due to both behaviors being dependent on a certain level of general activation.

    "abstract": "The blind mole rat (Spalax ehrenbergi) is a solitary and aggressive fossorial rodent that inhabits its own individual tunnel system. Mole rats breed mainly in the winter, giving birth to a litter of three to four young on average [Nevo (1961) Mammalia 25:127–143]. Intraspecific interactions between adults occur mostly during the winter, which is the rainy season in Israel; after parturition, interactions occur between the mother and her offspring and between the siblings themselves until dispersal. Until now, the subterranean habitat of mole rats has prevented direct observation in the wild. Thus, there has been no direct evidence for the proximal factors that drive juvenile mole rats out of the maternal tunnel system as they shift from the social life-style of the young to the solitary life-style of the adult. In the present study, female mole rats were caught in the wild with their offspring and brought to the laboratory. The dispersal process of the young from the maternal nest was followed under two housing conditions: (1) restricted housing, simulating the physical conditions under which dispersal is delayed past the usual age, as often occurs during late winter floods in the field in areas of nonporous clay soils, and (2) nonrestricted housing, simulating the physical conditions that allow the young to disperse from their maternal tunnels at any time. In each housing condition, the mothers raised either one or three pups. During pup development, we monitored both maternal and juvenile agonistic variables during intraspecific interactions. Five major behavioural phases were identified during the ontogeny of the mole rat pups. Maternal aggression toward pups increased mainly in the first three phases of pup development, and sibling aggression increased from the third phase until dispersal. Under the restricted housing conditions, there was a delay in both the appearance of aggression in the \"family group\" as well as in dispersal age compared with the nonrestricted conditions. In the nonrestricted conditions, increased litter size resulted in delay in dispersal age. We suggest that the main proximate factor initiating natal dispersal is increased intolerance and aggression among siblings rather than maternal aggression. Only after the young began dispersing from the maternal tunnels did maternal aggression dramatically increase, thus preventing the offspring from returning. However, following floods, inhibition of aggression may enable the mole rat pups to stay with the family group and to disperse later when the physical conditions permit it. Aggr.

Participants completed a self-report questionnaire assessing the frequency and severity of family aggression (aggression between parents, parental aggression directed toward participants), as well as the frequency and severity of participants' aggression across a number of relationship types (dating, friends, strangers, people in bars, co-workers, bosses, police officers). The results of the present study indicate that a substantial proportion of college-aged males report a history of aggressive behavior, both in dating/spousal relationship and other-relationship types. Analyses revealed that observing parental aggression and receiving aggression from parents was related to aggression in dating relationships. However, only received aggression from parents was related to more general aggressiveness in other non–dating/spousal relationship types. The pattern of findings also suggest that it is important to assess the aggressive behavior of both parents to get a better understanding of the link between family aggression and later expressed aggression.

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of menstrual cycle phase on aggression in two groups of women, which differed in the severity of their self-reported perimenstrual symptoms. A low- and a high-symptom group were recruited using the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) to define the groups. Twenty-two subjects (11 low and 11 high symptom) participated across one menstrual cycle: during the premenstrual, menstrual, midfollicular, and ovulatory phases. The Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm was used to assess aggression on each day of participation. There were three main findings; a) rates of aggressive responding did not vary across phases of the menstrual cycle; b) the high-symptom group emitted higher rates of aggressive responding across the menstrual cycle than did the low-symptom group; and c) rates of aggressive responding correlated with the MDQ's behavioral and psychological scales and not the somatic scales. These findings indicate that the menstrual cycle phase does not differentially affect this laboratory measure of aggression. The differences found between the two symptom groups parallel a few reports indicating that women who differ in retrospectively reported mood and behavioral changes related to their menstrual cycle also differ on a number of other psychometric measures.

    "abstract": "In our database of 331 parental narratives of tantrums had by children 18–60 months old, 29% of the tantrums were followed by child-initiated affiliation with parents. Four variables increased the probability of children's post tantrum affiliation (PTA): age, prolonged screaming, physiological stress, and parent-initiated separation from the child during the tantrum. The age effect may be due to increasing post tantrum persistence of negative affect, to the emergence of shame, guilt, and embarrassment over this developmental period, and/or to increasing cognitive ability, empathic capacity, or socialization. Screaming, which may be analogous to the defensive vocalizations of nonhuman primates, increases PTA when prolonged for 6 min or more. Physiological stress (indicated by autonomic activation or respiratory distress) appears linked to prolonged screaming and may mediate its effects by increasing the child's dysphoria and need for consolation. Separation (parents' departure from the scene of the tantrum or their imposition of a time out) also appears linked to prolonged screaming and may reflect parents' response to an aversive auditory stimulus. There was no evidence that PTA was associated with the presence or degree of physically expressed anger in the tantrum. PTA may be associated with distress during the tantrum. The post conflict reconciliation which occurs in several domains of human social life may be first experienced by children in the aftermath of their tantrums. Aggr.

    "abstract": "This study examined the differences in social problem-solving strategies between the parents of aggressive and non-aggressive girls. The subjects were the parents of 26 aggressive 12- and 13-year-old girls (24 mothers and 13 fathers) and of 32 non-aggressive girls (32 mothers and 24 fathers). Social problem-solving strategies were assessed from the mothers' and fathers' descriptions of six social problems arising in the daily lives of their daughters. The results showed that the mothers of the aggressive girls scored higher on reprimanding and on indifference than the mothers of the non-aggressive girls, who discussed the problems with their daughters more. When the family system formed by both of the parents was treated as one unit, differences in the frequencies of social problem-solving strategies between the families of the aggressive and non-aggressive girls were also found. The parents of the aggressive girls advised their daughters on solving social problems typically (i.e., more often than the chance level) only if they directly asked for help. The mothers typically did not discuss the problems with their daughters or try to solve the problems themselves but more often diverted the responsibility to some persons outside of the home. The fathers were typically indifferent. In other words, these girls were often left without help from their parents. On the other hand, in the families with non-aggressive girls, indifference, avoiding discussion, and diverting responsibility were atypical strategies (i.e., more rare than the chance level). These results emphasize the role of the mothers, and especially the meaning of the family system, in predicting girls' aggressiveness. Aggr. Behav. 24:37–51, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

As an approach to this issue, the current paper reports two experiments that used aggression-inducing isolation-rearing conditions of either 8 days or 8 weeks. In 5-min tests in pairs after isolation it was found that leaping was the key aggressive response in conflicts between 14- to 15-week-old roosters. Leaps were more frequent overall and occurred earlier than did pecks. Although both dominant and subordinate birds leaped at one another to some degree, only the dominant birds had both “leap rights” and “peck rights.” The data indicated that leaping is a behavior that has an important, central role in the social organization of male domestic chickens. These laboratory results were comparable to certain archival data from classic field research.",

Three dimensions emerged: physical-verbal form, acquainted-unacquainted combatants, and an equity or fairness dimension. To examine the generality of this schema, offenders on probation were asked to perform the same task. A nearly identical dimensional structure emerged from multidimensional scaling; cosines between corresponding dimensions in the two studies were all in excess of .92. These results suggest that judgments of form, degree of relationship, and morality generalize to the criminal population at least when the episodes to be judged are held constant. The results are discussed in terms of underlying cognitive schema and episode “scripts”.",

These organisations include territorial family units, solo males (territorial or not), and bachelor groups. In both guanacos and vicuñas, family groups tended to have higher rates of agonistic interactions than bachelors and to be frequently involved in aggressive encounters, whereas bachelor groups showed the opposite tendencies. Encounters between family groups and solo males were more frequent than expected. Bachelors acted almost exclusively as recipients of aggressive interactions, whereas solitary and family males frequently initiated encounters. Family groups adopted different behaviours towards bachelors in the two camelids. In guanacos, the latter were simply ignored, whereas in vicuñas (where they tend to compete for food with families) bachelors were consistently attacked by families. The behaviour of solitary males showed the main difference between the two species. Guanaco solo males had a much more aggressive attitude than vicuña counterparts. Their proportion in guanaco population was also unexpectedly high. These results suggest that, in the less rigid organisation of guanaco society, the behaviour of solitary males is adopted by a number of adult males in an attempt to breed. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "A growing response to evidence suggesting the ineffectiveness of a variety of treatment approaches with juvenile delinquents is a prescriptive intervention strategy. Here the effort is made to tailor aspects of the therapist assigned, the therapeutic relationship, and the treatment itself to an optimal match with receptivity characteristics of the delinquent clients involved. Several clinicians have proposed that productive psychotherapy with such clients must begin with the offering of an impersonal therapist-client relationship, one less threatening and more attractive to youngsters typically mistrustful of adults and reluctant to explore their own emotional functioning. The present study examined this proposition in a 3 × 4 factorial design crossing three levels of interviewer-offered empathy and genuineness with four types of delinquent adolescents grouped in terms of Warren's Interpersonal Maturity Level Category system. Dependent measures included four of the criteria typically utilized in research on the quality of initial psychotherapeutic relationships: (1) subject liking for or attraction to the interviewer, (2) subject self-disclosure to the interviewer, (3) subject-stated willingness to attend a second interview, and (4) actual subject attendance or nonattendance at a second scheduled interview. With a few exceptions, study results indicated that across quality-of-relationship criteria, youngsters in the I-level categories reflective of mistrust, nonpsychological mindedness, and reluctance to explore feelings were significantly more responsive to Low empathy-High genuineness interviewers than to interviewers communicating either High empathy-High genuineness or High empathy-Low genuineness. These results are seen as standing in firm support of a prescriptive view of psychotherapy in general, and of the particular interviewer communication condition of low empathy combined with high genuineness as an apparently utilitarian prescription for juvenile delinquents in particular.",

To address this question, accessibility, target movement, and vocalization among pigeon conspecifics were investigated in two different aggression tests: 1) paired aggression (PA); and 2) schedule-induced aggression (SI). In the PA test, dominant and subordinate roles formed quickly, and soon aggression episodes started to decline. In part, the subordinate's yielding behavior appeared to discourage attack. The significance of the target bird's behavior on attack frequency was borne out by the finding in the SI test that pigeons attacked a shielded, live, active target more often than a passive one. Furthermore, using a specially constructed stuffed pigeon in the SI test, results indicated that programmed, combined aggressive vocalization and body movement evoked most attacks with the VT schedule, vocalization alone evoked the next highest number of attacks, body movement alone the third most, and combined silence and immobility the least attacks. These findings provide a basis for explaining some past reported results associated with target features and a means for selecting other target features for future study.",

The subject's latency to setting a shock, the intensities of the shocks set, the durations of the shock settings, and the subject's reaction times were recorded. When an irrelevant message was delivered, passive responses, well below those of the opponent, resulted in the lowest level of retaliation.

In the present report, we observe that small transients of testosterone secretion could have very rapid anabolic effects on a cultured muscle-derived cell line. Specifically, we have examined the effects of testosterone on metabolism in cultured C2C12 myotubules, using a silicon microphysiometer. The instrument monitors cellular extrusion of protons and acidic metabolites, and such extrusion is directly linked to ATP hydrolysis, thus providing a real-time measure of cellular metabolism. Testosterone caused a small but significant increase in metabolism. The most striking feature of this effect was its rapidity, in that it occurred within 3 hr. This rapid enhancement of metabolism suggested that testosterone might be enhancing substrate uptake even more rapidly. Indeed, we found that testosterone increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake within 1 min. The rapidity of this effect seemed to preclude mediation by classical intracellular steroid receptors. In support of this, we were unable to detect specific intracellular binding of testosterone. These findings show that testosterone can exert rapid anabolic effects on substrate transport and metabolism in myotubules. Should this finding general to muscle in vivo, it suggests that relatively small individual differences in testosterone profiles, in response to various social interactions, may have very real consequence for subsequent muscle physiology. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "A follow-up study was conducted on the aggressive and delinquent behavior of an original sample of 220 pupils of two age groups. The subjects were 7 and 9 years old in 1978 when they were interviewed for the first time. The present paper focuses on predictors of the subjects' aggressive and criminal behavior in adolescence and in young adulthood. Four different groups of variables were chosen as possible predictive factors: 1) parental aggression, punitivity, and attitudes of rejection toward the child, 2) previous acts of aggression by the subjects, 3) the viewing of violence on television during childhood, and 4) aggressive, indifferent, and delinquent behavior in adolescence. Physical aggression in adolescence and the number of arrests and traffic violations in young adulthood were used as dependent variables. The analyses established that for the male subjects, the best predictor of physical aggression in adolescence was previous aggression, whereas for the female subjects the best predictor of physical aggression in adolescence was previous viewing of violence on television. The number of arrests in young adulthood was best predicted for the male subjects on the basis of previous aggression and viewing of violence on television. The best predictors of the number of arrests in young adulthood for the female subjects were, apart from previous aggression and viewing of violence on television, also aggressive and delinquent behavior in adolescence as well as parental aggression, punitivity, and attitudes of rejection. The results emphasize the importance of the atmosphere of socialization in childhood and previous aggressive behavior as significant predictors of physical aggression in adolescence and criminal behavior in young adulthood. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "In a series of three studies, we investigated the influence of a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (fluoxetine) on the rough-and-tumble play of juvenile rats. In Experiment 1, both members of eight pairs of solitary-housed juvenile rats received either vehicle, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg fluoxetine in a counterbalanced within-subject design 20 min before being allowed to play for 5 min periods on four successive test days. The 5 and 10 mg/kg pretreatments significantly reduced incidence of pins during play without affecting dorsal contacts. In Experiment 2, one member of each of 19 established play pairs received 5 mg/kg fluoxetine 20 min before play, while the other member received vehicle. Dominant rats showed no reduction in pins as a result of fluoxetine treatment, but subordinate rats who received fluoxetine exhibited significant reductions in pins. Subsequent dyadic analyses indicated that in pairs where the subordinate animal received fluoxetine, dominant animals maintained their pinning advantage over the 10 days of testing, but in pairs where the dominant animals received fluoxetine, this pinning asymmetry diminished. In Experiment 3, we replicated the above procedure with inexperienced play pairs, to control for the effects of prior social learning. Fluoxetine treatment (5 mg/kg) significantly reduced both pins and dorsal contacts in all treated rats. The results indicate that fluoxetine can reduce the playful pins of juvenile rats, but that prior social learning mediates the strength of these effects. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "During fighting, adult ground squirrels frequently face each other laterally, arch the back, and piloerect the tail. In a diurnal species, such distinctive visual cues seem consistent with the suggestion that the lateral display serves a communicatory function. However, a detailed analysis of videotaped sequences of free-living Richardson's ground squirrels from two consecutive mating seasons suggested that the lateral maneuver has a functional role in combat. Because most agonistic encounters involve chasing, the rump is the principal body area bitten. When stationary, however, the opponent's rump is bypassed, and bites are targeted at the shoulders. Defensively, a hip thrust is used to block such attacks to the shoulder by pushing the opponent's head away. Offensively, the lateral maneuver is used to push against the opponent, providing a vantage point from which to lunge at the opponent's shoulders. In addition, the defender can launch counterattacks at the side of the head. The lateral orientation provides the attacker with a means of evading such attacks, by swerving laterally away. In some encounters, both the offensive and defensive variations of the lateral maneuver were used by both opponents, often simultaneously. Therefore, irrespective of the signalling function of the lateral display, much of its occurrence during combat can be explained in terms of its role as a combat tactic. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The offspring-defense hypothesis of maternal territoriality in solitary and semisocial mammals [Wolff JO and Peterson JA. 1998. Ethol Ecol Evol 10:227–239] was evaluated in another taxon using maternal and nonmaternal female red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), a freshwater decapod crustacean that shows pronounced shelter-related maternal aggression. The maternal females were of three different categories: (1) ovigerous, (2) carrying primarily stage 1 offspring, or (3) tending offspring that were primarily stage 2. Each female was in residence in an individual aquarium containing only a gravel substrate for 24 hr prior to serial intrusions by male conspecifics. Virtually all of the residents, maternal and nonmaternal, excavated a depression (shelter) in the substrate prior to the first intrusion. The results showed that residents in each of the maternal categories won a significantly higher proportion of their encounters than did the nonmaternal residents, which showed only negligible defense and lost every encounter. However, there were no significant differences in encounter outcomes between the maternal resident categories. There was clear defense of the shelter by maternal females, with virtually all fighting being in or around it, thus demonstrating stable, heightened territorial defense throughout these maternal phases of reproduction. This support of the offspring-defense hypothesis of maternal territoriality is the first such evidence for a freshwater crustacean and is very similar to that recently reported in a related marine decapod, the American lobster (H. americanus).

    "abstract": "The relations between reactive aggression, situational cues, and emotion regulation were examined by means of the Pulkkinen Aggression Machine (PAM) task. In the PAM, provocation and response were systematically varied under two conditions: the impulsive aggression condition and the controlled aggression condition. In the impulsive condition, no information about the attacker was provided, while in the controlled condition the attackers were specified in terms of sex, age, and physical strength. The task was administered to 109 children aged 8 to 13 years. Boys (n = 61) and girls (n = 48), as well as subgroups of Adjusted (n = 67) and Maladjusted (n = 26) children were compared. The results confirmed earlier findings showing that there is a strong relationship between attack and response intensity. However, this relationship was consistently modified by the effects of situation and personality-related variables. This meant that, while for the impulsive condition response intensity was closely tied to stimulus intensity, in the controlled condition this effect was modulated by the characteristics of the opponent: the more equal the opponent the stronger the retaliations displayed. The Maladjusted children reacted more intensively in the impulsive condition and to minor provocation in the controlled condition than the Adjusted children. This suggests that the intensity of the elicited aggression in the Maladjusted group was particularly dependent on contextual rather than internal control. Aggr.

By extending the structural model ofMadhavan,Richardson, andRoomans (1997), I develop a unique cross-market model that can decompose spread components and explain intraday price formation for the futures market by using the order flow information from theKOSPI 200 options market, which is a market that is closely related to the futures market as well as considered to be one of the most remarkable options market in the world. The empirical results indicate that the model implied spread and the permanent component of the spread that results from informed trading tend to be underestimated without the inclusion of options market information. Furthermore, the results imply that trades of in-the-money options, which have high delta values, generally incur a more adverse information cost component (the permanent spread component) of the futures market than those of out-of-the-money options, which have relatively low delta values. Finally, I find that the adverse information cost component that is estimated from the cross-market model exhibits a nearlyU-shape intraday pattern; however, it sharply decreases at the end of the trading day.",

We are grateful to the adolescents who participated in this study and to school principals who allowed us to collect data in their schools. Moreover, we wish to thank Christoph Burger, Bianca Pollhammer, Marie-Therese Schultes, Elisabeth Stefanek, and Takuya Yanagida for their help in conducting the project. 3. The following changes need be made to the Methods section (page 87, right column, line 29ff.; new additions in bold type): “[…] Data acquisition took place at schools in the context of a project on social competence (Vienna Social Competence Training; see national intervention evaluation study (ViSC Social Competence Program; Strohmeier, Hoffmann, Schiller, Stefanek, & Spiel, 2012). Informed consent was obtained from parents and school officials. Agg-IATs were administered on desktop computers in the respective schools' computer pools during regular school hours. Trained experimenters supervised the entire test process. All other measures were administered in paper-pencil mass-testing sessions separately via an Internet-based questionnaire in the schools' computer labs. The order of the items within scales was counterbalanced to avoid any systematic order effects. IAT data could be matched with paper-pencil the other data on the basis of a personalized 10-digits code… 4. The following changes need be made to the Methods section (page 89, right column, lines 14-17 and lines 31-33; new additions in bold type): […] School students who self-identified as victims at least once during the last two months were asked to nominate up to five peers from their class who had behaved aggressively toward them within the last two months.

    "abstract": "Abstract Dimensions of negative parenting, including permissive, authoritarian, and psychologically controlling parenting behaviors, are associated with children's engagement in relational aggression. However, some youth may be more strongly influenced by negative parenting than others, and effects may depend on whether aggression is proactive or reactive in function. In a community sample of 236 preadolescent children followed over 1 year, we examined whether children's skin conductance level reactivity (an index of “fight or flight” response) and gender moderated links between parents' self‐reported negative parenting behaviors and increases in children's teacher‐reported proactive and reactive relational aggression. Findings indicated that negative parenting predicted increases in proactive and reactive relational aggression, and, consistent with differential susceptibility theory, effects often emerged among highly reactive youth. Associations between negative parenting and proactive relational aggression emerged for boys but not girls. Results tentatively suggest that associations between parenting and aggression vary by the function of aggression, children's physiological reactivity to stress, and gender, although results should be interpreted with caution due to high levels of missing data. Implications for theory and intervention are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined influences on girls' evaluations of relational aggression situations. Second-, third-, fifth-, and sixth-grade girls evaluated four relational aggression conflict scenarios in terms of attributions of aggressor's intentions, evaluator's behavioral response, evaluator's affective state, and how likely the situation was to actually occur. Girls evaluated intentions of a best friend more positively, reported being more mad at an enemy, and perceived conflict to be more likely to occur with an enemy than a best friend. Aggressor intentions in direct conflict scenarios (aggressor said something mean to evaluator) were perceived as more negative than aggressor intentions in indirect conflict scenarios (aggressor said something mean about evaluator to another peer). Younger girls reported intentions of their enemy as being more positive than did older girls. Further, older girls reported intentions of their best friend as being more positive than intentions of their enemy. Older girls also were more accurate in conceptualizing variations in the conflict setting (direct, indirect) and responding in a context-consistent manner. Findings are discussed in terms of the social-relational and social-situational processes that influence children's evaluations of relational aggression and how the current study extends previous research on relational aggression.

    "abstract": "This study examines the intraday formation process of transaction prices and bid–ask spreads in the KOSPI 200 futures market. By extending the structural model of Madhavan, A., Richardson, M., and Roomans, M. (1997), we develop a unique cross-market model that can decompose spread components and explain intraday price formation for the futures market by using the order flow information from the KOSPI 200 options market, which is a market that is closely related to the futures market as well as considered to be one of the most remarkable options markets in the world. The empirical results indicate that the model-implied spread and the permanent component of the spread that results from informed trading tend to be underestimated without the inclusion of options market information. Further, the results imply that trades of in-the-money options, which have high delta values, generally incur a more adverse information cost component (the permanent spread component) of the futures market than those of out-of-the-money options, which have relatively low delta values. Finally, we find that the adverse information cost component that is estimated from the cross-market model exhibits a nearly U-shaped intraday pattern; however, it sharply decreases at the end of the trading day. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In a second test of the hypothesis chicks that viewed a moving object during isolation and chicks isolated without movement were tested with a live con-specific and their number and locus of pecks were compared. Neither experiment supported the hypothesis. Movement alone failed to excite aggressive pecks and prior experience with movement failed to suppress aggressive pecks. In the first experiment imlated chicks treated the live testmate more aggressively than the moving or stationary model. In the second experiment aggressive pecking of chicks was unaffected by prior experience with movement, These fmdmgs do not support the hypothesis that movement excites aggression in isolated chicks.

The additional aim was to investigate whether the violence content enhances the popularity of a program. Typically, the frequency and intensity of violent constructions varied with program type, and with cultural and temporal settings, but the attractiveness of violence varied only with program type. Violence in non-fiction was generally less frequent, less intense, and less attractive than that in fiction. U.S. fiction contained violence more frequently than Finnish fiction, while violence in exported European films was, on average, more intense than in other productions. Attractive style of violent portrayals was represented equally in fiction regardless of the TV culture. Higher violence content or attractiveness of TV violence did not contribute toward larger audiences.

Asymmetries due to resident status had strong effects on agonistic behaviour, with asymmetries in body sizes producing weaker effects.

However, when the intruder was larger than the residents (higher than 5% in length and 20% in weight), the percentage of combats won by the residents decreased to 85.7%. There was a significant correlation between fight intensity and size asymmetry in favour of the resident fish. The resident fish was more aggressive and persistent in attacks, and contests were more intense when the size of the intruder was greater. During agonistic interactions, the frontal attacks and lateral displays were more frequent when the intruders were similar or larger than residents.

A chance for the intruder to retreat was manipulated by testing the resident females in either a single- or a two-compartment cage. The effect of a protected nest was examined by providing females with a nest box having a narrow entrance. During each test, an infanticidal adult male was introduced into the cage of a resident female and her pups. I observed that neither the presence of a protected nest nor the chance for the intruders to retreat to a different compartment, or a combination of the two, increased the ability of a female to defend her litter against an intruder male. Moreover, neither of these two factors influenced the overall behavior of the resident females. I obtained similar results after using data from previous studies to examine the influence of both of these factors on the efficiency of maternal aggression. Overall, these two approaches showed that females are often unable to prevent intruders from committing infanticide. I discuss the validity of the hypothesis that maternal aggression evolved as a mechanism to protect offspring from infanticide. Aggr. Behav. 24:385–396, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The mouse defense test battery (MDTB) has been designed to examine anxiogenic- or anxiolytic-like properties of psychoactive drugs through effects on specific defensive behaviors. In the present study, the MDTB was used to evaluate the potential contribution of genetic factors to these behaviors. The data revealed pronounced differences in several defense reactions among four inbred strains (BALB/c, C57BL/6, CBA, DBA/2) and one outbred (Swiss) mouse line. Thus, when subjects were introduced into the apparatus, Swiss and C57BL/6 displayed the highest levels of horizontal and vertical activities, while BALB/c and DBA/2 mice showed intermediate and CBA low activity rates. When subjects were chased by the rat, C57BL/6 mice used flight as the dominant defense strategy, while the defensive responses of BALB/c, C57BL/6, and DBA/2 mice consisted of flight reactions and risk assessment activities. However, when flight or escape was not possible, risk assessment became the predominant feature of the defense repertoire in the C57BL/6 mice. When defensive threat/attack behaviors were required, Swiss, BALB/c, DBA/2, and C57BL/6 mice showed very similar reactions in terms of the magnitude of the responses observed. CBA mice were poorly defensive in all these test situations. Finally, after the rat was removed from the test apparatus, Swiss, DBA/2, and C57BL/6 mice displayed more vertical activities than BALB/c mice. These latter, however, showed an increased level of ambulation compared to the activity recorded before the rat exposure. Together, these findings indicate that genetic factors contribute to defensive behaviors in this animal model of anxiety. The different behavioral profiles displayed by the strains used here may provide the means to obtain a better insight into the neurobehavioral mechanisms involved in anxiety-related disorders. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Reports in the literature suggest that gravid female lobsters (Homarus americanus) are more aggressive than non-gravid female lobsters. In an earlier study [Cromarty SI et al. 1998. Biol Bull 194:63–71], we showed that, with one exception, gravid females did not respond to an unfamiliar stimulus with escape swimming. Here we present quantitative evidence showing that gravid female lobsters are more aggressive than non-gravid females. Gravid and non-gravid females were allowed to fight against larger, non-gravid female opponents in an enclosed arena. The videotaped behaviors were ranked in a behavioral hierarchy (Rank of Aggression) according to their degree of aggressiveness and intensity. The behaviors were classified and ranked as follows: (1) aggression toward opponent, (2) redirected aggressive behavior (toward arena wall), (3) redirected defensive behavior, (4) defensive behavior against opponent, and (5) avoidance behavior. Gravid lobsters performed more behaviors and more aggressive behaviors than did non-gravid controls. The behaviors of gravid females ranked higher on the Rank of Aggression scale than did non-gravid females. The opponents of gravid females performed more aggressive and more intensely aggressive acts than the opponents of non-gravid females; they also performed more defensive acts (i.e., those used to ward off an opponent's attack) than did their non-gravid opponents, although there were no differences in intensity of defensive behaviors between gravid and non-gravid animals. There were no significant differences in the number of avoidance behaviors among the four types of combatants (gravid, non-gravid, gravid opponent, and non-gravid opponent), and none in avoidance tailflipping. However, gravid females were more likely to perform aggressive tailflips and performed significantly more aggressive tailflips than non-gravid animals. Together, this suggests that any physiological inhibition of escape swimming may have been overcome by the heightened intensity of gravid fights and the increased aggressiveness of gravid animals.

    "abstract": "Subordination constitutes a natural and often chronic stress condition for males of virtually all species of social mammals. Subordinate male rats of mixed-sex groups maintained in visible burrow systems show high-magnitude changes in adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones and, in a subpopulation, disruptions in hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function. Changes in brain serotonin systems have been extensively documented in both colony subordinates and colony dominants, with other regional neurotransmitter system changes also indicated. The group experience seems to change a variety of behaviors both inside the colony situation and in tests run outside the colonies and may disrupt the relationship found in controls between hypothalamic pituitary adrenal response to an acute stressor and defensive behavior. Comparisons of these patterns of stress response with those of other chronic stress models such as learned helplessness and chronic mild stress suggest that, in terms of adrenal and gonadal steroid hormone response, subordination constitutes a more severe stressor. Some involvement of the serotonin system has been demonstrated for both subordination and more traditional models, and other systems may prove to be involved in both. However, a central feature of both learned helplessness and chronic mild stress paradigms is a specific criterion behavior or behaviors, emphasized as models for particular psychopathologies. Thus, learned helplessness and chronic mild stress studies have tended to emphasize the effects of pharmacological agents on these models, whereas work with subordination has been focused on analysis of the biobehavioral stress process itself.

    "abstract": "In the early stages of an agonistic encounter between mice, the loser of the conflict initially exhibits pronounced flight and escape attempts. When exposure to attack is prolonged, however, defeated mice display a decrease in these active defenses and become increasingly passive. The generality of such defeat-induced passivity was investigated in the present study by examining acutely defeated mice in the forced swim test, a nonsocial but threatening environment that normally engenders high levels of escape behavior. In the present experimental model, highly aggressive male C57BL/6 mice were used to defeat smaller male intruders of the DBA/2 strain in a series of brief (2-min) encounters spaced 2 min apart. In Experiment 1, DBA/2 mice were administered four defeat encounters and were then given a 10-min swim test following a postdefeat delay of 0, 30, or 60 min. Activity in the swim test was determined both by a novel, automated device that detected movement-induced perturbations in the water medium via infrared beam interruptions and by the standard observational measurement of percent time immobile. Both activity measures indicated a significant suppression effect of defeat on swim activity, the magnitude of which declined steadily as the delay between the defeat encounters and the swim test increased. In Experiment 2, DBA/2 mice experienced zero, one, two, three, or four defeat encounters spaced 2 min apart and were administered the swim test 30 min following the last defeat encounter. Activity in the swim test decreased as the number of defeat encounters increased. The present findings suggest that defeat-induced passivity in mice is of a global nature, persisting in other threatening environments in which high levels of escape activity would normally be observed. Similarities between the parameters of the present phenomenon and those of opioid-mediated defeat analgesia are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 24:257–269, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

A computerized version of the Taylor \"aggression machine\" was used. Spirits-drinking subjects drank 1.0 ml of 100% alcohol per kg body weight. To compensate for the lower alcohol concentration, beer- and wine-drinking subjects drank 20% more. No significant differences were found between drinkers of different beverages in terms of blood alcohol levels. Results indicated that spirits elicited more direct physical aggression than either beer or wine. Three different possible explanations for this finding were discussed. Aggr.

One hundred six children (Mage = 4.40 years old, SD = 0.55 years old, Range: 3.08-5.33 years old, 51% boys) enrolled in Head Start programs and their caregivers participated. In the fall caregivers completed surveys on forms (i.e., the manifestation of behavior) and functions of aggression (i.e., motivation of behavior), and prosocial behavior. The following spring children completed two moral reasoning tasks that measured children's judgment and reasoning of harm, and their attributions of transgressors' reasoning. The LCA revealed a 3-class solution: (1) high levels of relational aggression and moderate levels of prosocial behavior (bistrategic controllers), (2) low levels of both aggression and average prosocial behavior (uninvolved), (3) high levels of all types of aggression and low levels of prosocial behavior (high aggression). Subsequent analyses suggest that uninvolved children prioritize adhering to authority over other concerns, and bistrategic controllers focused on goal-oriented reasoning. Overall, our findings support that recognizing patterns of behavior may be useful in understanding children's moral reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory rats, like many other animal species, transport food. Their behavior is influenced by factors such as food size, the time required to eat, travel distance, travel difficulty, and the availability of cover, etc. Recent versions of optimal foraging theory suggest that species that display such behavioral patterns do so in order to minimize risk to predation while at the same time maximizing food gain. Nevertheless, it is not clear that this explanation applies to rats, nor is it easy to investigate this problem in a laboratory. The results of the present study on urban feral rats show that their food handling behavior is similar to that of domestic rats. The results also suggest that food carrying can serve defensive as well as communicative functions. Aggression around food sources was high. Smaller rats always carried food and some large rats infrequently carried food, suggesting that the food carrying by smaller, subordinate rats may help them avoid conspecific aggression. The rats also vigorously attempted to steal food that was carried home by conspecifics. This result suggests that food carrying can redistribute food resources and inform conspecifics about food availability. The results demonstrate the utility of multilevel behavioral analysis and also demonstrate that for rats, food transport has functions other than predator avoidance, including avoidance of conspecific aggression and communication about food availability.

    "abstract": "It was hypothesized that in a competitive interaction in which an opponent first used threats and fines a) subjects would use the highest level of coercion that could be justified by the available norms, b) subjects would be inhibited by a norm that justified using only low levels of coercion, but c) when the opponent used a magnitude of coercion which exceeded the norm, subjects would also violate the norm and retaliate with an equally high magnitude of coercion, and d) subjects would use the maximum levels of coercion when engaging in a competitive game without norms. These hypotheses were examined in a 3 × 2 factorial experiment in which the amount of coercion allowable by a norm (Low Norm, High Norm, and No Information) and the level of coercion (Low or High) were manipulated. As predicted, aggressive reactions by subjects were inhibited when the provoker conformed to a low norm by using a low level of coercion. On the other hand, subjects retaliated by using a high level of coercion when the level of coercion used by a provoker violated the norm. Subjects who could justify their behavior by the availability of a high punitive norm tended to use all of the coercive power available to them even when the provoker used a low level of coercion. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Significant differences were found with regard to the age and sex of the respondents in their perception of what constituted an anxiety-provoking situation. Both young and old men and women perceived overt physical threat in public as being the most hazardous scenario. Men and women between the ages of 20 and 39 differed significantly in their perceptions of threat. Women perceived potential rape situations as being the most hazardous, whereas the corresponding variable for a high percentage of the men was loss of property. Both men and women in this age group, however, regarded invasion of personal living space while they were present and unaware as being highly anxiety provoking. The findings are discussed and biological differences in human perception of what constitutes a threatening situation postulated.",

A group of convicts were asked to quantify pairwise dissimilarity among aggressive social situations. The data obtained were processed by Multidimensional Scaling. The results show the necessity of taking into account 3 dimensions (justifiability, instrumentality and degree of involvement with the victim) in distinguishing among aggressive episodes. This finding is discussed in terms of cultural differences, and the usefulness of the perception of aggressive episodes as a basis for a taxonomic system is proposed.",

Footshock-induced aggression was tested in Wistar rats allocated to one of three experimental groups: control (oil-injected) males (M), males neonatally injected with the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate (CA), and males treated as in the CA group but gonadectomized just before puberty (CAG). An antiaggressive effect of CA in those adult male rats neonatally treated with this compound was found. Neonatal exposure to cyproterone acetate exerts an antiandrogenic effect over the expression of shock-induced aggressive behavior. The behavioral effects of CA were not countered by adult treatment with testosterone propionate.",

    "abstract": "Castrated Wistar rats were isolated for 8 months and their muricidal behavior was investigated. Significantly fewer (35%) of such rats became muricidal (CM) compared to controls. The steady-state levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA, DA, DOPAC, and NE, as well as the changes in synthesis or utilization rats of 5-HT and DA, were analyzed in 15 brain areas derived from CM rats and non-muricidal (CNM) control subjects. In CM rats, higher 5-HT levels were recorded in 5 areas considered to be involved in muricidal behavior: raphe, amygdala, olfactory tubercles, olfactory bulbs, and striatum. The alterations of serotonergic neurotransmission in castrated muricidal rats differ strikingly from those observed in non-castrated muricidal rats. An increase of 5-HT level and in the 5-HT synthesis index as well as a lower 5-HT utilization index were recorded in the raphe of CM rats. Our data suggest that the decrease of 5-HT levels generally said to be the main alteration in the muricidal rat's brain has to be reconsidered. Increased DA levels were observed in CM rats: raphe (50%), amygdala, olfactory tubercles, striatum, and septum (40%), while DA was decreased in cortical areas. There were slight increases of DA synthesis indices in the septum, olfactory tubercles and striatum with a decreased utilization index in the olfactory tubercles. Few alterations in NE levels were observed in CM rats: a decrease in the olfactory tubercles, superior colliculus, and striatum and an increase in temporal cortex. The monoaminergic alterations correlate with the modulation of muricidal behavior. Some areas (the olfactory tubercles, raphe, striatum, and temporal cortex) seem to be particularly involved. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

These situations differ in urgency, and in the likelihood of success if there is resistance to the instigator. Expectations of persons were elicited as to their response to the particular aggressive act, the counter-response then expected of the instigator of the attack, and the subsequent contingent responses of each of the two persons, victim and instigator, until one or the other withdrew. The results show, in general, different payoffs at each interactive point over the ongoing serial stages in a situation, rather than an overall generalized contingency expectation, with these being different for self and the symbolized other, and also different for the three situations. Personality and sex-role measures showed minimal relation to the expectancies, and then not at the opening of the conflict, and for the instigator's rather than for the victim's expected responses.",

    "abstract": "Mouse killing by rats represents a predatory behavior that can be modified by drugs from several different therapeutic classes and by environmental conditions. Buspirone and gepirone, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics that stimulate serotonergic receptors (5HT1a) and inhibit isolation-induced intraspecies aggression, were tested for inhibition of muricidal behavior by isolated rats. Neither buspirone (3.0 mg/kg s.c.) nor gepirone (from 5.0 to 40 mg/kg) inhibited muricide. Additional rats were housed, either aggregated or isolated, and tested for muricidal behavior 9 times over 5 weeks to establish which animals were muricidal: thus, there were 4 groups of rats: muricidal or non-muricidal under either isolated or aggregated housing condition. [3H]-Spiperone was used to determine striatal D2 receptor Bmax and Kd and prefrontal cortex D2 and 5HT2 receptor binding. There were no changes across the four groups. Binding of [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) to 5HT1a receptors decreased in septum of both groups of isolated rats and binding to 5HT1b receptors decreased 50% in hippocampus of isolated and aggregated muricidal rats. Binding of [3H]-5HT to either receptor was unchanged in amygdaloid area and hypothalamus across all groups. Thus, stimulating pre- and postsynaptic 5HT1a receptors does not alter muricidal behavior and changes in 5HT1 receptor binding occurs in limited areas. Whether this limited change in hippocampal 5HT1b binding is important for establishing muricidal behavior is unclear; however the direction of the change is consistent with reports that decreased serotonergic activity increases predatory behavior.",

    "abstract": "In mice, aggression has a genetic component that acts in concert with environmental factors. Furthermore, inter-individual differences for the propensity to attack are partly attributable to allelic variants located on both the non-pseudoautosomal and recombinant regions of the mouse Y chromosome. However, no nucleotide change in a Y chromosome gene has yet been found to account for a behavior difference. Interspecies comparisons of aggressive behavior reveals some similarities between primates and mice, including both the existence of sexual dimorphism (males being more aggressive than females) and inter- male differences. Measures of aggression in primates and rodents were compared. The data supporting Y chromosome-specific factors in murine aggression are principally from reciprocal crosses, in which the strain of origin of the male parent predicts behavior. The human data derive from a Y-haplotype association study conducted in a Finnish popula- tion. T ype II alcoholism and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) are commonly associ- ated in men in Swedish and American populations. Whereas Y chromosome variations account for individual differences in alcohol dependence in Finnish population, results failed to show an association between a Y chromosome haplotype and ASPD. Relevance of murine attack behavior to human aggression is discussed. The hypothesis that Y chro- mosome gene variation is responsible for behavioral variation now requires direct testing at the gene sequence level. The genes located on the Y chromosome are TSPY, RPS4Y, TDF, ZFY, PRKY, AZF1, BPY, DBY, HY, and RNM, and it is these genes whose allelic variants could influence inter-individual behavioral variations. Of particular interest for primate behavioral variation may be RPS4Y because this ribosomal protein subunit gene does not have a Y chromosome counterpart in rodents. Both humans and rodents have an RPS4X gene, but the RPS4Y gene could be a primate-distinct origin of sexual dimorphism and intermale behavioral variation.",

    "abstract": "The effects of the outcome of competitive encounters on physiological parameters have been studied, especially testosterone levels, but hardly on other systems that, however, present a high sensitivity to stress. This study assessed the effect of a competitive game on heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in a sample of university students. In addition, the influence of anxiety and attributions of the outcome was also explored. Only winners significantly showed a rise in HR during the competition followed by a decrease along the posttask phase in addition to more internal attributions. On the contrary, the average HR for losers during the competition was lower compared with their baseline values. No differences depending on the outcome were found in BP. The cardiovascular response as well as the subjective interpretation of the outcome suggest a more active strategy employed by winners vs. a more passive strategy of losers. Future studies should specifically investigate the importance of coping strategies for psychophysiological adaptation to contests and for the outcome reached. This would permit an advance in the understanding of the role of individual differences in the processes of stress and in associated diseases. Aggr. Behav. 27:351–359, 2001. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "In the present study the effects of a wide range of doses of the dopamine release inhibitor CGS 10746B were evaluated in spontaneous activity and in aggressive behaviour using the paradigm of isolation-induced aggression. The two higher doses (8 and 16 mg/kg) produced a decrease in spontaneous motor activity. Antiaggressive effects were observed after administration of doses from 4 mg/kg upwards. At this dose, CGS 10746B diminished threat and attack, and although an increase in immobility was observed, no impairment of other motor behaviours was presented. With higher doses, aggression was practically abolished but with a concomitant effect on many other behaviours. When animals were separated depending on their latency of attack, those that showed a long attack latency (LAL) presented a stronger response to 4 mg/kg than those that had a short attack latency (SAL), which were not affected in their aggression by this dose. We can conclude that presynaptic dopamine function is necessary for the normal expression of aggressive behaviours, since CGS 10746B reduces aggression at doses that do not affect spontaneous motor activity.

    "abstract": "The sequence of estradiol and progesterone is known to inhibit the expression of aggression in female hamsters. Despite the key importance of progesterone in the inhibition of aggression, little is known of the mechanisms through which progesterone may exert this effect. Three experiments were performed to assess the degree to which metabolites of progesterone can affect aggression in female Syrian hamsters. Systemic estradiol treatment followed by injections of either progesterone (300 μg IP) or 4-pregnen-21-ol-3,20-dione (DOC, 300 μg IP) reliably inhibited aggression. Systemic injection (75, 150, or 300 μg IP) of either 5α-pregnan-3α,21-diol-20-one (THDOC) or 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (3α,5α-THP) did not affect aggression. Intracerebroventricular infusion of 3α,5α-THP following systemic estradiol treatment also did not affect aggression. In a third experiment, female hamsters were given systemic treatments with estradiol and progesterone that were subthreshold with respect to inhibition of aggression. In these females, intracerebroventricular infusion of THDOC inhibited aggression. These results indicate that metabolites of progesterone can inhibit aggression, most notably in synergy with progesterone itself. Aggr. Behav. 27:372–381, 2001. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "A descriptive study was conducted of normal undergraduate students' impulsive homicidal thoughts and the weapons used in these fantasies. Participants completed a questionnaire asking them to describe a recent incident in which they thought about killing someone. A significant proportion of participants reported having homicidal fantasies. Most fantasies were elicited by frustrating or threatening interpersonal events and involved material-cultural weapons (e.g., firearms, knives, clubs) as opposed to organismic weapons (e.g., hands, feet). Material-cultural weapons were rated as easier to use and more lethal than organismic weapons, and participants reported higher self-efficacy beliefs for using material-cultural weapons. Most participants reported that they had been exposed to mass media models using their weapons of choice and that they had access to these weapons. The findings are interpreted as evidence for evolved psychological machinery that can associate material-cultural implements with aggressive behavior and rehearse this association through fantasy.

    "abstract": "Studies informing ways to target aggression in youth, particularly through the identification of internal patterns predictive of concurrent and future levels of aggression, could be particularly beneficial. To this end, the current study surveyed 216 elementary-aged children on topics of perceived containment (i.e., perceived ability of authority figures to control, limit, and set consequences for one's behaviors), coping responses, and reactive (RA) and proactive aggression (PA). Using multilevel modeling, the individual and interactive effects of coping responses and perceived containment on aggression within time and across two school years were examined. Within time, lower levels of perceived containment were associated with greater RA and PA. Passive coping was also positively associated with RA. The relation between perceived containment and RA within time was dependent on humor, whereas the relation between perceived containment and PA depended on problem-solving. Across time, while T1 passive coping predicted the trajectory of both functions of aggression, a greater number of T1 coping responses predicted the slope of RA with problem-solving and friend support-seeking as well as T1 perceived containment also predicting the trajectory of RA. No coping responses moderated the relation between T1 perceived containment and the trajectory of RA. In contrast, humor moderated the influence of T1 perceived containment and the trajectory of PA. Findings give insight into the ways internal processes of perceived containment and coping are associated with patterns of aggression in elementary-aged youth. This work is valuable in identifying several potential areas for prevention and intervention research.",

The 15-min test period consisted of one of the following stress situations: social defeat (residentintruder test), restraint (confinement in a plexiglass cylinder), shock prod test (presentation of an electrified probe) and swimming. The influence of each stressor on the balance between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system was measured via quantification of the variability of heart rate and the occurrence of different kinds of cardiac arrhythmias. Defeated animals showed a much higher heart rate acceleration and a much lower variability of heart rate (indicating a marked shift of the autonomic balance towards sympathetic dominance), together with a much larger incidence of cardiac arrhythmias (mostly ventricular extrasystoles). Ventricular arrhythmias were mainly observed in the periods immediately following attacks, periods which were also characterized by peaks of heart rate and further reduction of heart rate variability. These data indicate that, by inducing a strong shift of autonomic balance towards the sympathetic branch, social aversive contexts can be far more detrimental to cardiac electrical stability than other non-social aversive stimuli.

    "abstract": "Jones and Davis's [1965. Advances in experimental social psychology. Academic Press] notion of “personalism” was experimentally tested in a situation in which behavior had negative hedonic relevance for the recipient. It was hypothesized that (1) if a person is attacked by another person, this victim will react more negatively than when no attack occurs and that (2) a victim who is singled out for attack will react more negatively compared with victims of an undistinctive attack (i.e., when the actor behaves similarly toward the victim and a third person). A 2 × 2 design was employed with “Victim of attack” as the first factor (no attack vs. attack) and “Behaviour toward a third person” as the second factor (no attack vs. attack). The main dependent variable was the number of attacks by the victim toward the attacker (retaliation). Thirty-two students took part in the experiment. Victims of attack retaliated more against the attacker than those who suffered from no attack. Victims of a personalistic attack retaliated more than victims of an undistinctive attack. The results, confirming both hypotheses, support an attributional view on harm-doing and contradict the notion of retaliation as pure behavioral reciprocity. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Three research programs on the genetics of aggression in mice and one on that for humans concerned with effects of the 5-HT system, especially receptor subtypes, on aggression are presented in this symposium.For mice, inbred strains (Simon), transgenic strains (Hilakivi-Clarke), and knock-out strains (Brunner) have been used in studies of the offense type of aggression.Simon has shown that there is between strain polymorphism for steroid activation of aggression.These are androgen and estrogen sensitive pathways which appear to modulate serotonin function at 5HT1A and 5HT1B receptor sites.The strains used by Hilakivi-Clarke differ in the singe transgene (transforming growth factor alpha, Tgfα) This gene may affect aggression through multiple neurotransmitters systems, including dopamine, serotonin, and GABA, and these may involve the estrogen sensitive pathway as described by Simon.The strains used by Brunner differ in the gene for the 5HT1B receptor.One of the strains is a knock-out mutant of this gene.Aggressive behavior is facilitated in the knock-out as is ethanol consumption, cocaine self-administration, and motor but not cognitive impulsivity.These research programs illustrate some of the advantages and limitations of genetic approaches to investigating the neural and hormonal basis of aggression in mice.For humans (Goldman et al.), polymporhisms for tryptophan hydroxylase are associated with the risk of suicide and variants of the 5HT1B receptor are associated with antisocial alcoholism.Neither is associated with variants of the dopamine receptor, DRD2.In discussion, the relation of the animal to human research will be considered.For example, the research of Brunner and her colleagues on the 5HT1B receptor and aggression in mice was partially the basis for investigating the behavioral effects of polymorphisms of the 5HT1B receptor in humans by Goldman and his colleagues.",

Participants' self-reported likelihood of joining in a crowd disturbance served as the dependent measure. The individual differences measures included physical aggression, anger, impulsivity, psychopathy, sensation seeking, and public self-consciousness. All but public self-consciousness was positively related to subjects' likelihood of escalating a disturbance. Participants' age, number of accompanying males, the false consensus effect, number and recency of fights, and attending in anticipation of watching player fights were also related to the dependent measure. A multiple regression analysis yielded a multiple R = .807, accounting for 65% of the variance.

This is the first time that infanticide in domestic cats has been witnessed directly and described. All infanticidal males were fully adult and sexually mature unknown males. All kittens killed were within their first week of life. The killing pattern was generally the same as that described in lions. All females reacted aggressively but could not prevent the infanticide. Three hypotheses are discussed : (1) infanticide is a remnant of cat male reproductive strategy selected in the original environment; (2) the conditions of the rural environment have created a selection pressure encouraging a polymorphism of infanticidal and noninfanticidal males to evolve; (3) infanticide is an abnormal behaviour caused by environmental conditions such as human disturbance.

    "abstract": "Social defeat by Tryon Maze Dull rats, resulting in loss of rank of a previously dominant rat, has recently been advanced as a model of loss of self-esteem and depression in humans. However, before loss of rank in animals can be assessed as a model of human depression, certain requirements must be fulfilled: (1) a situation must be developed in which rank can be determined, and this assessment must, under normal circumstances, remain stable if it is to be the baseline against which experimental manipulations are measured; (2) it must be established that defeat of a dominant animal does indeed cause a change in rank for that animal; and (3) once these practical requirements have been fulfilled, to be a \"model of depression,\" antidepressant treatment must be seen to reverse the loss of rank caused by defeat. Each of these points is considered in turn. (1) So far, a situation has not been discovered in which social hierarchies are produced that are both unequivocal and stable. (2) Defeat seems to have very variable effects, the variability being most likely due to natural variation in the quality of the defeat \"experience\" for the recipient. (3) Antidepressant treatment has not yet been shown to reverse the effects of defeat for more than a single test session. In addition, it has not been demonstrated that loss of rank actually produces a lowering of self-esteem in the animal as opposed to helplessness. If the change in self-perception does not change the value the animal attributes to itself, but rather the level of ability the animal attributes to itself, then the model breaks down. Consequently, at this time, the predictive validity of the model has not yet been established. Furthermore, its construct validity may be low. In summary, much more work is required before defeat-induced loss of status in the rat can be properly assessed as a model of loss of self-esteem and depression in humans, although it may be bedevilled by theoretical weaknesses even at this early stage.

The groups of fish receiving spatially fixed food displayed less aggression than those receiving spatially variable food. The period (before, during, or after feeding) during which aggressiveness is measured also has influence in the results. During the prefeeding and postfeeding periods (absence of food), groups that were fed with food spatially fixed displayed less aggression than those that received spatially variable food. However, when food was present there were no differences in the number of aggressive acts carried out by fish groups in both environments. The aggressiveness shown by the groups of fish was always more pronounced during the postfeeding period than during the prefeeding period. The dominant fish was more aggressive when food was spatially fixed, and especially when food was present. Therefore, the subordinates were more aggressive when food was spatially variable and particularly when food was present and during the postfeeding period. Aggr.

    "abstract": "Maternal aggression was studied in Oreochromis mossambicus during the mouthbrooding cycle. Brooding females were observed in heterosexual captive groups, and their agonistic interactions and behavioural activities were registered. Brooding females were classified into three classes according to the developmental stage of the brood they were incubating: phase 1, brooding eggs; phase 2, brooding fry with yolk-sac; phase 3, brooding fry with exogeneous feeding. The behaviour of the brooding females was compared with the behaviour of control non-incubating females. During the brooding cycle females become increasingly more aggressive toward other individuals, with their aggressiveness reaching a peak in phase 3. During the brooding cycle the females also suppress their feeding activities. The outcome of the agonistic interactions (victories–defeats) of the brooding females was positively correlated with the brooding phase but not with clutch size. The main function of maternal aggression in O. mossambicus seems to be the defence of the vulnerable brood against predators, including conspecifics, at a developmental stage when the fry start to forage outside the mother's mouth.

Intact females showed aggressive behavior more frequently than ovx females. Ovx females injected with P, with P+E, or with T made significantly more attacks, and these attacks lasted longer than those observed for oil-treated voles.

    "abstract": "The goal of the current study was to determine whether aggressive and conventional rule-violating behaviors could be predicted by social-cognitive beliefs and values regarding aggression and conventional rule violations. The extent to which adolescents (N = 398; grades 9 through 12) engaged in both aggressive behavior and conventional school rule violations was assessed using self-ratings and peer nominations. Results indicated that aggressive and conventional rule-violating behaviors were predicted by (1) beliefs about the legitimacy of aggressive and convention-violating behavior; (2) values placed on the expected outcomes of these acts, such as negative self-evaluations, peer disapproval, and tangible rewards; and (3) beliefs about the effects of these acts on others. Furthermore, the results indicated that aggressive and conventional transgressions were predicted better by beliefs and values within the same social-cognitive domain than across domains. In contrast to females, male students committed more aggressive acts and conventional rule violations and reported beliefs and values that were more supportive of aggressive behavior and conventional rule-violating behavior. However, gender differences in beliefs and values were greater for aggressive acts than for conventional acts. The results support the need to distinguish between behavioral domains when attempting to predict social behavior. Aggr. Behav. 24:347–365, 1998. © 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This study asked whether ducklings' forceful pecks at a nonliving target object could be validly identified as aggressive. Previously isolated ducklings were exposed to a small cylindrical object that could serve as a target for aggressive pecks and as an object for attachment. After initially attempting to flee from the target, they vigorously pecked at it and also showed signs of the formation of a social (imprinting) attachment. In all important respects this pattern of behavior was identical to the pattern of escape, aggressive pecks, and attachment seen when a previously isolated duckling first encounters a conspecific. Social housing, a manipulation which attenuates aggression against live targets in ducklings and other species, reduced pecking at the nonliving target object. Early aversive stimulation, which enhances aggression against live targets, increased pecking at the object. These findings support the use of nonliving targets in the study of aggression in ducklings.",

    "abstract": "In evaluating the role of behavioral interactions in the maintenance of ecological and ethological isolation in sympatric populations of P. leucopus and P. gossypinus, the interspecific behavior of 94 animals in all possible sex pair combinations was observed in 84 staged dyadic trials of 15-minutes duration. Qualitatively the patterns of behavior differed little between sexes or species. Despite a high inter-individual variability and the high proportion of amicable interactions, the mean frequency of occurrence of aggressive behavior as well as the number of trials in which aggressive behavior occurred was greater in trials of animals from areas of range sympatry in comparison with those of the control animals from areas of range allopatry. Although the dominance relationships in many trials were unclear, gossypinus nonetheless consistently dominated leucopus. These data combined with examination of the habitats of these mice where their ranges do not overlap suggest that agonistic interactions may implement species integrity either primarily by Limiting or preventing the occupancy by leucopus of areas in which gossypinus occurs or secondarily by reducing the chances of pair bond formation.",

    "abstract": "To explore genetic-developmental differences in the biobehavioral effects of induced illness, males from two lines of mice selectively bred for high or low levels of aggressive behavior were injected with endotoxin (Escherichia coli, LPS: 0.25 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/kg, or 2.5 mg, i.p.) or saline. Body temperature, weight, and locomotor activity were monitored immediately before and 8 and 24 hr after injection. Twenty-four hours after injection, social behaviors were assessed in a 10-min dyadic test, and hypothalamus, spleen, and serum were collected. In both lines, endotoxin treatment increased behavioral immobility (\"freezing\") and decreased social exploration. Other effects showed line differences: Males from the high-aggressive line had a lower threshold to endotoxin-induced effects on body temperature, weight loss, spleen weight, and corticosterone. Social reactivity (startle response to mild social investigation) increased in the high-aggressive line and decreased in the low-aggressive line after treatment. In the high-aggressive line only, endotoxin decreased attack frequency and increased latency to attack. The interactions between selected line (genotype) and endotoxin treatment (environment) demonstrate that genetic-developmental differences in social and aggressive behavior may indicate the extent to which immune stimuli (e.g., bacteria, viruses, cytokines) function as \"biobehavioral stressors.\" Aggr.

    "abstract": "The purpose of the current research was to investigate adolescent offenders' perspectives about responses to interpersonal aggressive encounters. Specifically, participants' perspectives were assessed regarding the role of a bystander when either a friend or an acquaintance of the bystander was the victim of an aggressive act. Two aggressive acts were presented. First, the bystander witnessed an acquaintance stealing from the victim. Second, the bystander witnessed an acquaintance hitting the victim. Participants were asked to indicate (a) if the bystander would do anything (bystander expected behavior), (b) what the bystander would do (expected behavioral action), (c) if the action would be the right thing to do (evaluation of bystander expected behavioral action), and (d) what the bystander should do in response to the violation (prescribed bystander behavioral action). Results indicate that the adolescent offenders' perspectives varied as a function of offender status, type of aggressive act, as well as relationship of the victim to the bystander. Aggr.

Male rabbits were observed in seminatural conditions and three components of their agonistic behavior were recorded: follow, attack, and chase. The three behaviors were mutually correlated and clearly differed among the four members of each group. Within the social group, one rabbit was agonistically more active than the others and his supremacy was associated with an increased level of peripheral testosterone and higher estradiol binding in the hypothalamus. On the whole, the values of the hypothalamic estradiol binding were positively correlated with the behaviors. The results show that, in the male rabbit, agonistic activity is associated with changes in testosterone concentration and in the binding at the central level of its aromatized metabolite estradiol.

    "abstract": "We exposed the pups of three F1 genotypes of mice to a daily regime of cocaine by injecting their mothers (all C57BL/10J strain) on days 7–18 of gestation with 20 mg/kg subcutaneously. Pups of the cocaine and control groups did not differ on measures of maternal and pup health or size. Male pups were weaned and isolated at 21 days of age and their behaviors measured in an intermale aggression situation at about 80 days of age. Treated and untreated males of each F1 genotype were paired in dyads with either a C3H/HeJ (hawk-like) or AKR/J (retaliator-like) standard tester male. Standard tester males were not exposed to cocaine. Cocaine treatment alone reduced the overall level of aggression in dyads, and in interaction with genotype or the standard tester it altered the behavior of dyads in all phases of social interaction: the initiation, content, and outcome.

Although the data generally support the view that ritanser in has little effect on offense or defense in male mice, the stimulation of pre-aggressive behavior (threats, alerts, tail rattles) was detected in some nonaggressive mice. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

When naive rats of the same colony were similarly housed but received ethanol 20% in water as the sole source of drinking fluid (ll.5 g ethanol/kg/day), the percentage of killer rats was the same. However, when the rats were housed in similar conditions and submitted to a 1-day ethanol withdrawal, the percentage of muricidal rats increased to 25%. Ethanol intake in the same conditions as described above did not change muricidal behavior of spontaneous killers and did not induce killing behavior in nonkiller animals. GABA-mimetic agents administered IP blocked ethanol withdrawal-induced killing behavior as well as spontaneous muricidal activity.",

The study was founded in two theoretical approaches to family violence and its effects upon youth violence--stress theory and social learning theory. METHODOLOGY: The author employed a quasi-experimental cross-sectional design with a non-probability sample of 295 youth. These participants included students from four classes in eleventh and twelfth grades in a small city central high school, adolescents referred to three juvenile court centers and delinquent youth from five secure institutions. Data were obtained via use of a self-report questionnaire that included measures of family violence (defined as threatened or actual force within the family unit, including pushing, shoving, slapping, beating or threatening with a weapon - 20 items), family functioning (defined as the degree to which family members interacted with and supported each other - 12 items), parental aggression towards the subject, peer group relationships, violence committed whilst with the peer group and whilst within the school setting, school functioning and information about demographic characteristics of each respondent. Analysis included examination of frequencies and correlations. FINDINGS/DISCUSSION: The sample consisted of 75% males, and 74% whites, with an average age of just under 17 years. Intact families, with biological parents still married, were found for 49% of the group, although 60% reported two parent figures such as step-parents or other adults. Single mothers were present in 25% of the sample. Father's occupation was unknown to almost 25% of the subjects, and of those who did respond, two-thirds reported fathers in blue collar occupations while one-third held white collar jobs. Half of the respondent's mothers were listed as housewives or unemployed, or no information was provided. Mothers who were employed outside the home usually worked in unskilled or semiskilled jobs (60%), with 40% being employed in white collar positions such as teaching and nursing. 9% of the sample received welfare. An examination of the role of family functioning found that most of the sample scored in the moderate to high categories, indicating that the sample was not characterized by family dysfunction or disintegration. Most of the subjects from the low functioning homes came from the juvenile courts and institutions groups. Family violence was divided into four categories - parental violence against the child, child violence against the parent, intrasibling violence and intraparent violence. A strong negative correlation was found between family functioning and child violence toward the parents, although the correlations between functioning and the other three forms of intrafamily violence were weak. Strong correlations were found between each of the four types of intrafamily violence (see following table). Correlation of Family Violence with Family Functioning ----------------------------------------------------------------- Parent-Child Child-Parent Sibling Parent Function Parent-Child 1.00 Child-Parent 0.36 1.00 Intrasibling 0.65 0.21 1.00 Intraparent 0.48 0.20 0.47 1.00 Functioning 0.02 -0.22 0.04 0.09 1.00 ----------------------------------------------------------------- By examining the case records of those subjects from juvenile courts and institutions, the author found that youths who exhibited violent behavior toward their parents had usually been beaten either by their parent(s) or by a male guardian. Families in which violence was present were often characterized by alcohol abuse, and comparison of violent youths with non-violent youths revealed that those who were violent had more often been the victims of violence form their parents, had been violent towards their siblings more often and had witnessed their parents behaving violently towards each other more than had their non-violent counterparts. The author concluded that intrafamily violence was more likely to be present in homes with low levels of family functioning, conforming with both stress and social learning theories of family violence. AUTHOR'S RECOMMENDATION: The author suggested that an intervention model for cases of family violence should take into account a number of different factors, such as who initiated the violence, the intensity of the interaction, the context of the incident, the levels of stress within the home situation and whether the parties involved in the violent event had any form of psychological dysfunction. Included in the model, and based upon social learning theory, should be efforts to unlearn the violent behavior that might have been learned in the home, by providing alternative methods for achieving one's goals. The author concluded by stressing the importance of considering family dynamics in cases of family conflict. EVALUATION: The author presents an interesting discussion of some of the factors that might contribute to the manifestation of family violence. The good sample size and the relative representativeness of the sample provide good external validity to the study, although internal validity is difficult to assess due to the lack of detailed discussion about the measures employed. Only family functioning and family violence were analyzed - issues pertaining to peer group relations, violence committed with peers or whilst in school and school functioning were initially included in the study design, but were then not addressed in the analysis or in the discussion. Implications of the findings were briefly discussed, although more reference to both stress and social learning theories would have been useful. In general, this study, whilst brief and sometimes lacking in thorough discussion, does contribute to the knowledge in the field of family violence. And perhaps more importantly, it acts as a reminder to researchers and policy makers alike that this is a field that warrants much further attention.

The measurements were made with competitive protein-binding radioassay. Only among the habitually violent offenders with antisocial personality were the values low when compared with other violent offenders, antisocial personality without the habitually violent tendency, and male clinic personnel. Poor motivation already in school, truancy, attention deficit and undersocialized aggressive conduct disorder problems seemed to be connected with the low cortisol levels.",

    "abstract": "Presentation of a natural predator, a cat, was used to differentiate elements of maternal attack by female rats on a male intruder. Following exposure (without direct physical contact) of post-partum females to a cat or to a toy stuffed cat (control group), the females were replaced in their home cages and presented with a male intruder rat. Cat exposure reliably decreased lateral attack to the intruder, as well as locomotion, but had no effect on either jump attack or an upright defensive posture (boxing). Since predator exposure produces a somewhat durable increase in defense, along with inhibition of nondefensive behavior, these results suggest that maternal aggression represents a mixture of offensive, usually related to competition, and defensive (protective) behaviors. The results indicate that maternal aggression, as a parental care behavior, appears to be at least partially resistant to fear. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This research examined children's reasoning about expected (i.e., what a peer would do) and prescribed (i.e., what a peer should do) responses to unprovoked, intentional aggressive actions in two contexts: as a victim of such a transgression and as a witness to the incident. Physical harm and property damage items were used in a structured interview format. There were 90 subjects drawn from three elementary school grades (2nd, 4th, and 6th). Children differentiated between the expected and prescribed responses of peers and significant developmental differences in children's evaluations were found. Although the majority of the subjects in all grades denounced retaliation on the basis of concerns about others' welfare, older children stated that peers were likely to retaliate against the perpetrator nonetheless. Across different contexts, older children's responses appeared to reveal a greater independence from authority in negotiating peer interactions. In evaluating the witness's responses to aggressive acts, younger children's expected and prescribed responses were less disparate than that of the older children. The utility of including different vantage points of the child in examining children's social reasoning about aggression and the application of the present findings to social information-processing models are discussed.

    "abstract": "Previous examinations of perceptions of aggressive behaviors have used static stimulus presentations (e.g., photographs or slides). This investigation examined the impact of varying amounts of geographical and temporal contextual information on observers' perceptions of actors' intentions to physically and psychologically (intimidate) harm others. Participants (51 elite ice hockey players) were randomly assigned to view one of three video-taped presentations showing eight ice hockey behaviors in either a) a dynamic mode with contextual information, b) a dynamic mode with no context, or c) a static, \"freeze-frame\" mode. MANOVA results showed that non-aggressive stimuli were perceived as less aggressive, and aggressive stimuli were perceived as more aggressive in dynamic presentations with context than in static presentations. Based on these findings, it is suggested that future research focussing on perceptions of aggressive behavior utilize a dynamic stimulus presentation containing context material. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the differences in social problem-solving strategies among parents of aggressive and non-aggressive boys. The subjects were the parents of 27 aggressive boys (27 mothers and 18 fathers) and of 28 non-aggressive boys (26 mothers and 20 fathers). Social problem-solving strategies were assessed from subject descriptions of six social problems arising in the daily lives of the adolescents. The results showed that the parents of both the non-aggressive and aggressive boys helped their sons to solve social problems, but the parents of the aggressive boys were more likely to be indifferent and punishment oriented. The role of the fathers was crucial. They were active in the families with non-aggressive boys, while the mothers were passive, but passive in the families with aggressive boys, while the mother had a supervising role. The solutions suggested by the fathers of the non-aggressive boys were more in number and focused on improving the social problem-solving skills of the son, i.e., the fathers discussed the problems, advised and helped their sons to solve them more than the fathers of the aggressive boys. It may be suggested that fathers' social problem-solving strategies and parental roles are of importance in the development of children's social behavior. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Agonistic encounters of all three species of the vocalizing genus Trichopsis were observed in order to compare species-specific fighting strategies and the specific investment in acoustics. Additionally, these encounters were compared to agonistic encounters of Macropodus opercularis which was considered to be mute. The aim of this comparison was to investigate if mute fishes stress visual or tactile displays. Within the genus Trichopsis, significant differences among the three species were found in qualitative and quantitative analysis of displays. Frontal display occurred only in Trichopsis vittata, whereas a strong tail-beating while vocalizing was only observed in Trichopsis pumila. Fight duration and the number of sounds and circlings were highest in Trichopsis schalleri. The largest relative distances between circling opponents occurred in T. pumila, the smallest species. Also, the number of attacks was lowest in T. pumila. Fighting assessment seemed to be different in each species. For the first time, sound production has been reported for Macropodus opercularis (infrequently and with extreme low sound pressure levels), but much more investment in visual and tactile displays has been demonstrated. Lowering the branchiostegal membrane and spreading the opercula occurred only in M. opercularis and was never observed in any of the Trichopsis species. The number of attacks was higher in Macropodus than in any Trichopsis species. The relative distance between Macropodus opponents while circling was closest compared to the three Trichopsis species. Visual and contact displays are reduced in extensively vocalizing fish species, like Trichopsis sp., compared to mute or seldom vocalizing species, like Macropodus. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Political symbologists generally concur that the use of symbols by regimes and citizens often leads to favorable outcomes for the manipulators. However, the various impacts of the different politcal contents, or “messages,” within the symbolic containers, or “media,” have gone unstudied. Thus, a major theoretical question arises: Do all messages of political symbols have similar political outcomes? The present investigation examines the impact of the various political contents of symbols manipulated by protest groups during demonstrations in the U.S.S.R. The findings suggest that the higher the politicality of the symbolic content, the fewer the concessions and the greater the repressions meted out to demonstrators by Soviet regime officials. Thus, although a deprived citizen group can obtain favorable regime policies through the political use of symbols, it might benefit most by depoliticizing their content.",

    "abstract": "In experiment 1, pairs of young male rats became obese on a palatable and complex diet high in fat, sucrose, and protein. The obese pairs exhibited greater within-group weight variability and, when tested as adults, were significantly more aggressive toward an unfamiliar conspecific than chow-fed controls. The increased aggressivity of obese males was not due to the relatively larger resident-intruder weight disparities in these pairs, since weight-matched pairs of unfamiliar animals were as aggressive toward each other as pairs not matched in body weight (experiment 2). The complex and calorically dense diet may have accelerated the development of the experimental animals, producing subjects whose aggressivity was comparable to that of much older animals.",

    "abstract": "Since Bandura's theories of social learning were published [Social Learning Theory, 1977; Am Psychol 34:439, 1979], several explanations have been given to account for the fact that observers tend to do the same thing as an observed person. This effect of patterning facilitation was studied. The role that Bandura [Am Psychol 34:439, 1979] attributes to patterning as an augmentor of aggressiveness was studied starting from the position of Carver et al. [J Exp Soc Psychol 19:403, 1983]. They suggest that an aggressive pattern will provide a given subject with a number of conceptual schemes to interpret any other information or situation. In order to assess this hypothesis, different subject groups were exposed to different sequences of patterning and were observed in a later situation similar to the one presented in the pattern. The effect of patterning basically depended on the subject's interpretation of the situation, and this guided their subsequent motivations. © 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

However, much of the research in this field is atheoretical and the findings are inconsistent and contradictory. The present study investigated the seasonality of homicide and robbery in Israel from 1977 to 1985. The authors' analysis was informed by the routine activity approach, which views crime as a function of three main elements: motivated offenders, suitable targets, and absence of guardians. Based on this approach and on the differences between homicide and robbery (with regard to motivation, victim-offender relationships, and planning), the authors hypothesized that robbery would show a seasonal trend and would peak during the winter (November through March) due to the increase in the cost of living and the facilitating environmental conditions during these months.

Building on accounts of the development of democracy in ancient Athens and prior systematic studies, it is suggested that agricultural density is related to land inequality, which in turn leads to increased political rights in formerly tribal/hereditary polities. The second model centers on political violence as a consequence of this land inequality, which in turn leads to increased political rights after some violent political upheaval. The third model suggests urbanization and trade begin the process, and in turn economic development then leads to increased political rights. Support is found for the Athenian and economic development models, therefore emphasizing that political violence receives the least empirical confirmation. Most important for the origins of democracy in agrarian society is the robust influence of land inequality on political rights, discovered under a variety of analytic conditions.",
