    "abstract": "As mobile phones advance in functionality and capability, they are being used for more than just communication. Increasingly, these devices are being employed as instruments for introspection into habits and situations of individuals and communities. Many of the applications enabled by this new use of mobile phones rely on contextual information. The focus of this work is on one dimension of context, the transportation mode of an individual when outside. We create a convenient (no specific position and orientation setting) classification system that uses a mobile phone with a built-in GPS receiver and an accelerometer. The transportation modes identified include whether an individual is stationary, walking, running, biking, or in motorized transport. The overall classification system consists of a decision tree followed by a first-order discrete Hidden Markov Model and achieves an accuracy level of 93.6% when tested on a dataset obtained from sixteen individuals.",

    "abstract": "Sensor network technology promises a vast increase in automatic data collection capabilities through efficient deployment of tiny sensing devices. The technology will allow users to measure phenomena of interest at unprecedented spatial and temporal densities. However, as with almost every data-driven technology, the many benefits come with a significant challenge in data reliability. If wireless sensor networks are really going to provide data for the scientific community, citizen-driven activism, or organizations which test that companies are upholding environmental laws, then an important question arises: How can a user trust the accuracy of information provided by the sensor network? Data integrity is vulnerable to both node and system failures. In data collection systems, faults are indicators that sensor nodes are not providing useful information. In data fusion systems the consequences are more dire; the final outcome is easily affected by corrupted sensor measurements, and the problems are no longer visibly obvious. In this article, we investigate a generalized and unified approach for providing information about the data accuracy in sensor networks. Our approach is to allow the sensor nodes to develop a community of trust. We propose a framework where each sensor node maintains reputation metrics which both represent past behavior of other nodes and are used as an inherent aspect in predicting their future behavior. We employ a Bayesian formulation, specifically a beta reputation system, for the algorithm steps of reputation representation, updates, integration and trust evolution. This framework is available as a middleware service on motes and has been ported to two sensor network operating systems, TinyOS and SOS. We evaluate the efficacy of this framework using multiple contexts: (1) a lab-scale test bed of Mica2 motes, (2) Avrora simulations, and (3) real data sets collected from sensor network deployments in James Reserve.",

    "abstract": "Network lifetime has become the key characteristic for evaluating sensor networks in an application-specific way. Especially the availability of nodes, the sensor coverage, and the connectivity have been included in discussions on network lifetime. Even quality of service measures can be reduced to lifetime considerations. A great number of algorithms and methods were proposed to increase the lifetime of a sensor network—while their evaluations were always based on a particular definition of network lifetime. Motivated by the great differences in existing definitions of sensor network lifetime that are used in relevant publications, we reviewed the state of the art in lifetime definitions, their differences, advantages, and limitations. This survey was the starting point for our work towards a generic definition of sensor network lifetime for use in analytic evaluations as well as in simulation models—focusing on a formal and concise definition of accumulated network lifetime and total network lifetime. Our definition incorporates the components of existing lifetime definitions, and introduces some additional measures. One new concept is the ability to express the service disruption tolerance of a network. Another new concept is the notion of time-integration: in many cases, it is sufficient if a requirement is fulfilled over a certain period of time, instead of at every point in time. In addition, we combine coverage and connectivity to form a single requirement called connected coverage. We show that connected coverage is different from requiring noncombined coverage and connectivity. Finally, our definition also supports the concept of graceful degradation by providing means of estimating the degree of compliance with the application requirements. We demonstrate the applicability of our definition based on the surveyed lifetime definitions as well as using some example scenarios to explain the various aspects influencing sensor network lifetime.",

    "abstract": "We describe LEAP+ (Localized Encryption and Authentication Protocol), a key management protocol for sensor networks that is designed to support in-network processing, while at the same time restricting the security impact of a node compromise to the immediate network neighborhood of the compromised node. The design of the protocol is motivated by the observation that different types of messages exchanged between sensor nodes have different security requirements, and that a single keying mechanism is not suitable for meeting these different security requirements. LEAP+ supports the establishment of four types of keys for each sensor node: an individual key shared with the base station, a pairwise key shared with another sensor node, a cluster key shared with multiple neighboring nodes, and a global key shared by all the nodes in the network. LEAP+ also supports (weak) local source authentication without precluding in-network processing. Our performance analysis shows that LEAP+ is very efficient in terms of computational, communication, and storage costs. We analyze the security of LEAP+ under various attack models and show that LEAP+ is very effective in defending against many sophisticated attacks, such as HELLO flood attacks, node cloning attacks, and wormhole attacks. A prototype implementation of LEAP+ on a sensor network testbed is also described.",

    "abstract": "An effective approach for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks is scheduling sleep intervals for extraneous nodes while the remaining nodes stay active to provide continuous service. For the sensor network to operate successfully, the active nodes must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. Furthermore, the network must be able to configure itself to any feasible degree of coverage and connectivity in order to support different applications and environments with diverse requirements. This article presents the design and analysis of novel protocols that can dynamically configure a network to achieve guaranteed degrees of coverage and connectivity. This work differs from existing connectivity or coverage maintenance protocols in several key ways. (1) We present a Coverage Configuration Protocol (CCP) that can provide different degrees of coverage requested by applications. This flexibility allows the network to self-configure for a wide range of applications and (possibly dynamic) environments. (2) We provide a geometric analysis of the relationship between coverage and connectivity. This analysis yields key insights for treating coverage and connectivity within a unified framework; in sharp contrast to several existing approaches that address the two problems in isolation. (3) We integrate CCP with SPAN to provide both coverage and connectivity guarantees. (4) We propose a probabilistic coverage model and extend CCP to provide probabilistic coverage guarantees. We demonstrate the capability of our protocols to provide guaranteed coverage and connectivity configurations through both geometric analysis and extensive simulations.",

This article introduces a scalable, distributed weighted-multidimensional scaling (dwMDS) algorithm that adaptively emphasizes the most accurate range measurements and naturally accounts for communication constraints within the sensor network. Each node adaptively chooses a neighborhood of sensors, updates its position estimate by minimizing a local cost function and then passes this update to neighboring sensors. Derived bounds on communication requirements provide insight on the energy efficiency of the proposed distributed method versus a centralized approach. For received signal-strength (RSS) based range measurements, we demonstrate via simulation that location estimates are nearly unbiased with variance close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound. Further, RSS and time-of-arrival (TOA) channel measurements are used to demonstrate performance as good as the centralized maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) in a real-world sensor network.",

In particular, a maximum likelihood based formulation and an interval based formulation are discussed. The SDP solution can then also be used as a starting point for steepest descent based local optimization techniques that can further refine the SDP solution.We also describe the extension of the basic method to develop an iterative distributed SDP method for solving very large scale semidefinite programs that arise out of localization problems for large dense networks and are intractable using centralized methods.The performance evaluation of the technique with regard to estimation accuracy and computation time is also presented by the means of extensive simulations.Our SDP scheme also seems to be applicable to solving other Euclidean geometry problems where points are locally connected.",

    "abstract": "This article describes one of the major efforts in the sensor network community to build an integrated sensor network system for surveillance missions. The focus of this effort is to acquire and verify information about enemy capabilities and positions of hostile targets. Such missions often involve a high element of risk for human personnel and require a high degree of stealthiness. Hence, the ability to deploy unmanned surveillance missions, by using wireless sensor networks, is of great practical importance for the military. Because of the energy constraints of sensor devices, such systems necessitate an energy-aware design to ensure the longevity of surveillance missions. Solutions proposed recently for this type of system show promising results through simulations. However, the simplified assumptions they make about the system in the simulator often do not hold well in practice, and energy consumption is narrowly accounted for within a single protocol. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of a complete running system, called VigilNet, for energy-efficient surveillance. The VigilNet allows a group of cooperating sensor devices to detect and track the positions of moving vehicles in an energy-efficient and stealthy manner. We evaluate VigilNet middleware components and integrated system extensively on a network of 70 MICA2 motes. Our results show that our surveillance strategy is adaptable and achieves a significant extension of network lifetime. Finally, we share lessons learned in building such an integrated sensor system.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the impact of radio irregularity on wireless sensor networks. Radio irregularity is a common phenomenon that arises from multiple factors, such as variance in RF sending power and different path losses, depending on the direction of propagation. From our experiments, we discover that the variance in received signal strength is largely random; however, it exhibits a continuous change with incremental changes in direction. With empirical data obtained from the MICA2 and MICAZ platforms, we establish a radio model for simulation, called the Radio Irregularity Model (RIM). This model is the first to bridge the discrepancy between the spherical radio models used by simulators and the physical reality of radio signals. With this model, we investigate the impact of radio irregularity on several upper layer protocols, including MAC, routing, localization and topology control. Our results show that radio irregularity has a relatively larger impact on the routing layer than the MAC layer. It also shows that radio irregularity leads to larger localization errors and makes it harder to maintain communication connectivity in topology control. To deal with these issues, we present eight solutions to deal with radio irregularity. We evaluate three of them in detail. The results obtained from both the simulations and a running testbed demonstrate that our solutions greatly improve system performance in the presence of radio irregularity.",

For such resource-constrained devices, data transmission is a very energy-consuming operation. To maximize WSN lifetime, it is essential to minimize the number of bits sent and received by each device. One natural approach is to aggregate sensor data along the path from sensors to the sink. Aggregation is especially challenging if end-to-end privacy between sensors and the sink (or aggregate integrity) is required. In this article, we propose a simple and provably secure encryption scheme that allows efficient additive aggregation of encrypted data. Only one modular addition is necessary for ciphertext aggregation. The security of the scheme is based on the indistinguishability property of a pseudorandom function (PRF), a standard cryptographic primitive. We show that aggregation based on this scheme can be used to efficiently compute statistical values, such as mean, variance, and standard deviation of sensed data, while achieving significant bandwidth savings. To protect the integrity of the aggregated data, we construct an end-to-end aggregate authentication scheme that is secure against outsider-only attacks, also based on the indistinguishability property of PRFs.",

    "abstract": "Various sensor network measurement studies have reported instances of transient faults in sensor readings. In this work, we seek to answer a simple question: How often are such faults observed in real deployments? We focus on three types of transient faults, caused by faulty sensor readings that appear abnormal. To understand the prevalence of such faults, we first explore and characterize four qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods. Rule-based methods leverage domain knowledge to develop heuristic rules for detecting and identifying faults. Estimation methods predict “normal” sensor behavior by leveraging sensor correlations, flagging anomalous sensor readings as faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods start with an a priori model for sensor readings. A sensor measurement is compared against its predicted value computed using time series forecasting to determine if it is faulty. Learning-based methods infer a model for the “normal” sensor readings using training data, and then statistically detect and identify classes of faults. We find that these four classes of methods sit at different points on the accuracy/robustness spectrum. Rule-based methods can be highly accurate, but their accuracy depends critically on the choice of parameters. Learning methods can be cumbersome to train, but can accurately detect and classify faults. Estimation methods are accurate, but cannot classify faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods are more effective for detecting short duration faults than long duration ones, and incur more false positives than the other methods. We apply these techniques to four real-world sensor datasets and find that the prevalence of faults as well as their type varies with datasets. All four methods are qualitatively consistent in identifying sensor faults, lending credence to our observations. Our work is a first step towards automated online fault detection and classification.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are crucial in supporting continuous environmental monitoring, where sensor nodes are deployed and must remain operational to collect and transfer data from the environment to a base-station. However, sensor nodes have limited energy in their primary power storage unit, and this energy may be quickly drained if the sensor node remains operational over long periods of time. Therefore, the idea of harvesting ambient energy from the immediate surroundings of the deployed sensors, to recharge the batteries and to directly power the sensor nodes, has recently been proposed. The deployment of energy harvesting in environmental field systems eliminates the dependency of sensor nodes on battery power, drastically reducing the maintenance costs required to replace batteries. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art in energy-harvesting WSNs for environmental monitoring applications, including Animal Tracking, Air Quality Monitoring, Water Quality Monitoring, and Disaster Monitoring to improve the ecosystem and human life. In addition to presenting the technologies for harvesting energy from ambient sources and the protocols that can take advantage of the harvested energy, we present challenges that must be addressed to further advance energy-harvesting-based WSNs, along with some future work directions to address these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Long Range (LoRa) is a Low-power Wide-area Network technology designed for the Internet of Things. In recent years, it has gained significant momentum among industrial and research communities. Patented by Semtech, LoRa makes use of chirp spread spectrum modulation to deliver data with promises of long battery life, far-reaching communication distances, and a high node density at the cost of data rate. In this article, we conduct a series of experiments to verify the claims made by Semtech on LoRa technology. Our results show that LoRa is capable of communicating over 10km under line-of-sight environments. However, under non-line-of-sight environments, LoRa’s performance is severely affected by obstructions such as buildings and vegetations. Moreover, the promise of prolonged battery life requires extreme tuning of parameters. Last, a LoRa gateway supports up to 6,000 nodes with PRR requirement of &gt;70%. This study also explores the relationship between LoRa transmission parameters and proposes an algorithm to determine optimal settings in terms of coverage and power consumption under non-line-of-sight environments. It further investigates the impact of LoRa Wide-area Networks on energy consumption and network capacity along with implementation of a LoRa medium access mechanism and possible gains brought forth by implementing such a mechanism.",

SensorScope is such a system, which has already been successfully deployed multiple times in various environments (e.g., mountainous, urban). Here, we describe the overall hardware and software architectures and especially focus on the sensor network itself. We also describe one of our most prominent deployments, on top of a rock glacier in Switzerland, which resulted in the description of a micro-climate phenomenon leading to cold air release from a rock-covered glacier in a region of high alpine risks. Another focus of this paper is the description of what happened behind the scenes to turn SensorScope from a laboratory experiment into successful outdoor deployments in harsh environments. Illustrated by various examples, we point out many lessons learned while working on the project.

Although approximately 71% of the world is covered in water, only 2.5% of this is fresh water; hence, fresh water is a valuable resource that must be carefully monitored and maintained. In developing countries, 80% of people are without access to potable water. Cholera is still reported in more than 50 countries. In Africa, 75% of the drinking water comes from underground sources, which makes water monitoring an issue of key concern, as water monitoring can be used to track water quality changes over time, identify existing or emerging problems, and design effective intervention programs to remedy water pollution. It is important to have detailed knowledge of potable water quality to enable proper treatment and also prevent contamination. In this article, we review methods for water quality monitoring (WQM) from traditional manual methods to more technologically advanced methods employing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for in situ WQM. In particular, we highlight recent developments in the sensor devices, data acquisition procedures, communication and network architectures, and power management schemes to maintain a long-lived operational WQM system. Finally, we discuss open issues that need to be addressed to further advance automatic WQM using WSNs.",

    "abstract": "The significance of air pollution and the problems associated with it are fueling deployments of air quality monitoring stations worldwide. The most common approach for air quality monitoring is to rely on environmental monitoring stations, which unfortunately are very expensive both to acquire and to maintain. Hence, environmental monitoring stations are typically sparsely deployed, resulting in limited spatial resolution for measurements. Recently, low-cost air quality sensors have emerged as an alternative that can improve the granularity of monitoring. The use of low-cost air quality sensors, however, presents several challenges: They suffer from cross-sensitivities between different ambient pollutants; they can be affected by external factors, such as traffic, weather changes, and human behavior; and their accuracy degrades over time. Periodic re-calibration can improve the accuracy of low-cost sensors, particularly with machine-learning-based calibration, which has shown great promise due to its capability to calibrate sensors in-field. In this article, we survey the rapidly growing research landscape of low-cost sensor technologies for air quality monitoring and their calibration using machine learning techniques.

However, to our knowledge, no systematic work has been done in this area so far. We construct an evaluation framework in which we first identify the candidates of block ciphers suitable for WSNs, based on existing literature and authoritative recommendations. For evaluating and assessing these candidates, we not only consider the security properties but also the storage- and energy-efficiency of the candidates. Finally, based on the evaluation results, we select the most suitable ciphers for WSNs, namely Skipjack, MISTY1, and Rijndael, depending on the combination of available memory and required security (energy efficiency being implicit).

    "abstract": "Broadcast authentication is a critical security service in wireless sensor networks. There are two general approaches for broadcast authentication in wireless sensor networks: digital signatures and μTESLA-based techniques. However, both signature-based and μTESLA-based broadcast authentication are vulnerable to Denial of Services (DoS) attacks: An attacker can inject bogus broadcast packets to force sensor nodes to perform expensive signature verifications (in case of signature-based broadcast authentication) or packet forwarding (in case of μTESLA-based broadcast authentication), thus exhausting their limited battery power. This paper presents an efficient mechanism called message-specific puzzle to mitigate such DoS attacks. In addition to signature-based or μTESLA-based broadcast authentication, this approach adds a weak authenticator in each broadcast packet, which can be efficiently verified by a regular sensor node, but takes a computationally powerful attacker a substantial amount of time to forge. Upon receiving a broadcast packet, each sensor node first verifies the weak authenticator, and performs the expensive signature verification (in signature-based broadcast authentication) or packet forwarding (in μTESLA-based broadcast authentication) only when the weak authenticator is valid. A weak authenticator cannot be precomputed without a non-reusable (or short-lived) key disclosed only in a valid packet. Even if an attacker has intensive computational resources to forge one or more weak authenticators, it is difficult to reuse these forged weak authenticators. Thus, this weak authentication mechanism substantially increases the difficulty of launching successful DoS attacks against signature-based or μTESLA-based broadcast authentication. A limitation of this approach is that it requires a powerful sender and introduces sender-side delay. This article also reports an implementation of the proposed techniques on TinyOS, as well as initial experimental evaluation in a network of MICAz motes.",

The 15.4 specifications specifically target wireless networking among low-rate, low-power and low-cost devices that is expected to be a key market segment for a large number of WSN applications. In this article, we first analyze the performance of the contention access period specified in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard in terms of throughput and energy consumption. This analysis is facilitated by a modeling of the contention access period as nonpersistent CSMA with backoff. We show that, in certain applications in which having an inactive period in the superframe may not be desirable due to delay constraints, shutting down the radio between transmissions provides significant savings in power without significantly compromising the throughput. We also propose and analyze the performance of a modification to the specification which could be used for applications in which MAC-level acknowledgements are not used.

This stems from an observation that the kernel function, which is a similarity measure critical to the effectiveness of a kernel-based learning algorithm, can be naturally defined in terms of the matrix of signal strengths received by the sensors. Thus we work in the natural coordinate system provided by the physical devices. This not only allows us to sidestep the difficult ranging procedure required by many existing localization algorithms in the literature, but also enables us to derive a simple and effective localization algorithm. The algorithm is particularly suitable for networks with densely distributed sensors, most of whose locations are unknown. The computations are initially performed at the base sensors, and the computation cost depends only on the number of base sensors. The localization step for each sensor of unknown location is then performed locally in linear time. We present an analysis of the localization error bounds, and provide an evaluation of our algorithm on both simulated and real sensor networks.",

The situation becomes worse if energy-efficient jamming can be achieved by exploiting knowledge of the data link layer. Encrypting the packets may help to prevent the jammer from taking actions based on the content of the packets, but the temporal arrangement of the packets induced by the nature of the protocol might unravel patterns that the jammer can take advantage of, even when the packets are encrypted. By looking at the packet interarrival times in three representative MAC protocols, S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC, we derive several jamming attacks that allow the jammer to jam S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC energy efficiently. The jamming attacks are based on realistic assumptions. The algorithms are described in detail and simulated. The effectiveness and efficiency of the attacks are examined. In addition, we validate our simulation model by comparing its results with measurements obtained from actual implementation on our sensor node prototypes. We show that it takes little effort to implement such effective jammers, making them a realistic threat. Careful analysis of other protocols belonging to the respective categories of S-MAC, LMAC, and B-MAC reveals that those protocols are, to some extent, also susceptible to our attacks.

However, establishing pairwise keys in sensor networks is a challenging problem, particularly due to the resource constraints on sensor nodes and the threat of node compromises. This article proposes to use both predeployment and postdeployment knowledge to improve pairwise key predistribution in static sensor networks. By exploiting the predeployment knowledge, this article first develops two key predistribution schemes, a closest pairwise keys scheme and a closest polynomials scheme . The analysis shows that these schemes can achieve better performance if the expected location information is available and that the smaller the deployment error is, the better performance they can achieve. The article then investigates how to use postdeployment knowledge to improve pairwise key predistribution in static sensor networks. The idea is to load an excessive amount of predistributed keys on sensor nodes, prioritize these keys based on sensors' actual locations discovered after deployment, and discard low-priority keys to thwart node compromise attacks. This approach is then used to improve the random subset assignment scheme proposed recently to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. The analysis indicates that the postdeployment knowledge can also greatly improve the performance and security of key predistribution.",

    "abstract": "Sensed data in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) reflect the spatial and temporal correlations of physical attributes existing intrinsically in the environment. In this article, we present the Clustered AGgregation (CAG) algorithm that forms clusters of nodes sensing similar values within a given threshold (spatial correlation), and these clusters remain unchanged as long as the sensor values stay within a threshold over time (temporal correlation). With CAG, only one sensor reading per cluster is transmitted whereas with Tiny AGgregation (TAG) all the nodes in the network transmit the sensor readings. Thus, CAG provides energy efficient and approximate aggregation results with small and often negligible and bounded error. In this article we extend our initial work in CAG in five directions: First, we investigate the effectiveness of CAG that exploits the temporal as well as spatial correlations using both the measured and modeled data. Second, we design CAG for two modes of operation (interactive and streaming) to enable CAG to be used in different environments and for different purposes. Interactive mode provides mechanisms for one-shot queries, whereas the streaming mode provides those for continuous queries. Third, we propose a fixed range clustering method, which makes the performance of our system independent of the magnitude of the sensor readings and the network topology. Fourth, using mica2 motes, we perform a large-scale measurement of real environmental data (temperature and light, both indoor and outdoor) and the wireless radio reliability, which were used for both analytical modeling and simulation experiments. Fifth, we model the spatially correlated data using the properties of our real world measurements. Our experimental results show that when we compute the average of sensor readings in the network using the CAG interactive mode with the user-provided error threshold of, 20%, we can save 68.25% of transmissions over TAG with only 2.46% inaccuracy in the result. The streaming mode of CAG can save even more transmissions (up to 70.24% in our experiments) over TAG, when data shows high spatial and temporal correlations. We expect these results to hold in reality, because we used the mica2 radio profile and empirical datasets for our simulation study. CAG is the first system that leverages spatial and temporal correlations to improve energy efficiency of in-network aggregation. This study analytically and empirically validates CAG's effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of coverage in planar heterogeneous sensor networks. Coverage is a performance metric that quantifies how well a field of interest is monitored by the sensor deployment. To derive analytical expressions of coverage for heterogeneous sensor networks, we formulate the coverage problem as a set intersection problem, a problem studied in integral geometry. Compared to previous analytical results, our formulation allows us to consider a network model where sensors are deployed according to an arbitrary stochastic distribution; sensing areas of sensors need not follow the unit disk model but can have any arbitrary shape; sensors need not have an identical sensing capability. Furthermore, our formulation does not assume deployment of sensors over an infinite plane and, hence, our derivations do not suffer from the border effect problem arising in a bounded field of interest. We compare our theoretical results with the spatial Poisson approximation that is widely used in modeling coverage. By computing the Kullback-Leibler and total variation distance between the probability density functions derived via our theoretical results, the Poisson approximation, and the simulation, we show that our formulas provide a more accurate representation of the coverage in sensor networks. Finally, we provide examples of calculating network parameters such as the network size and sensing range in order to achieve a desired degree of coverage.",

    "abstract": "An integral part of most security- and safety-critical applications is a dependable and timely alarm notification. However, owing to the resource constraints of wireless sensor nodes (i.e., their limited power and spectral diversity), ensuring a timely and jamming-resistant delivery of alarm messages in applications that rely on wireless sensor networks is a challenging task. With current alarm forwarding schemes, blocking of an alarm by jamming is straightforward and jamming is very likely to remain unnoticed. In this work, we propose a novel jamming detection scheme as a solution to this problem. Our scheme is able to identify the cause of bit errors for individual packets by looking at the received signal strength during the reception of these bits and is well-suited for the protection of reactive alarm systems with very low network traffic. We present three different techniques for the identification of bit errors based on: predetermined knowledge, error correcting codes, and limited node wiring. We perform a detailed evaluation of the proposed solution and validate our findings experimentally with Chipcon CC1000 radios. The results show that our solution effectively detects sophisticated jamming attacks that cannot be detected with existing techniques and enables the formation of robust sensor networks for dependable delivery of alarm notifications. Our scheme also meets the high demands on the energy efficiency of reactive surveillance applications as it can operate without introducing additional wireless network traffic.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks have attracted a lot of attention recently. Such environments may consist of many inexpensive nodes, each capable of collecting, storing, and processing environmental information, and communicating with neighboring nodes through wireless links. For a sensor network to operate successfully, sensors must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. This issue has been studied in wang et al. [2003] and Zhang and Hou [2004a], both of which reach a similar conclusion that coverage can imply connectivity as long as sensors' communication ranges are no less than twice their sensing ranges. In this article, without relying on this strong assumption, we investigate the issue from a different angle and develop several necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring coverage and connectivity of a sensor network. Hence, the results significantly generalize the results in Wang et al. [2003] and Zhang and Hou [2004a]. This work is also a significant extension of our earlier work [Huang and Tseng 2003; Huang et al. 2004], which addresses how to determine the level of coverage of a given sensor network but does not consider the network connectivity issue. Our work is the first work allowing an arbitrary relationship between sensing ranges and communication distances of sensor nodes. We develop decentralized solutions for determining, or even adjusting, the levels of coverage and connectivity of a given network. Adjusting levels of coverage and connectivity is necessary when sensors are overly deployed, and we approach this problem by putting sensors to sleep mode and tuning their transmission powers. This results in prolonged network lifetime.",

Second, CTP uses the Trickle algorithm to time the control traffic, sending few beacons in stable topologies yet quickly adapting to changes. Finally, CTP actively probes the topology with data traffic, quickly discovering and fixing routing failures. Through experiments on 13 different testbeds, encompassing seven platforms, six link layers, and multiple densities and frequencies, and detailed observations of a long-running sensor network application that uses CTP, we study how these three techniques contribute to CTP's overall performance.",

Recent research on energy-efficient data gathering in WSNs has explored the use of Compressive Sensing (CS) to parsimoniously represent the data. However, the performance of CS-based data gathering methods has been limited since the approaches failed to take advantage of judicious network configurations and effective CS-based data aggregation procedures. In this article, a novel Hierarchical Data Aggregation method using Compressive Sensing (HDACS) is presented, which combines a hierarchical network configuration with CS. Our key idea is to set multiple compression thresholds adaptively based on cluster sizes at different levels of the data aggregation tree to optimize the amount of data transmitted. The advantages of the proposed model in terms of the total amount of data transmitted and data compression ratio are analytically verified. Moreover, we formulate a new energy model by factoring in both processor and radio energy consumption into the cost, especially the computation cost incurred in relatively complex algorithms. We also show that communication cost remains dominant in data aggregation in the practical applications of large-scale networks. We use both the real-world data and synthetic datasets to test CS-based data aggregation schemes on the SIDnet-SWANS simulation platform. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HDACS model guarantees accurate signal recovery performance. It also provides substantial energy savings compared with existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Advances in micro-electronics and miniaturized mechanical systems are redefining the scope and extent of the energy constraints found in battery-operated wireless sensor networks (WSNs). On one hand, ambient energy harvesting may prolong the systems’ lifetime or possibly enable perpetual operation. On the other hand, wireless energy transfer allows systems to decouple the energy sources from the sensing locations, enabling deployments previously unfeasible. As a result of applying these technologies to WSNs, the assumption of a finite energy budget is replaced with that of potentially infinite , yet intermittent , energy supply, profoundly impacting the design, implementation, and operation of WSNs. This article discusses these aspects by surveying paradigmatic examples of existing solutions in both fields and by reporting on real-world experiences found in the literature. The discussion is instrumental in providing a foundation for selecting the most appropriate energy harvesting or wireless transfer technology based on the application at hand.

Our goal is to use automatic recognition of animal vocalizations to census the populations of native frogs and the invasive introduced species, the cane toad. This is a challenging application because it requires high frequency acoustic sampling, complex signal processing, wide area sensing coverage and long-lived unattended operation. We set up two prototypes of wireless sensor networks that recognize vocalizations of up to ninth frog species found in northern Australia. Our first prototype consists of only resource-rich Stargate devices. Our second prototype is more complex and consists of a hybrid mixture of Stargates and inexpensive, resource-poor Mica2 devices operating in concert. In the hybrid system, the Mica2s are used to collect acoustic samples, and expand the sensor network coverage. The Stargates are used for resource-intensive tasks such as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and machine learning. The hybrid system incorporates four algorithms designed to account for the sampling, processing, energy, and communication bottlenecks of the Mica2s (1) high frequency sampling, (2) thresholding and noise reduction, to reduce data transmission by up to 90%, (3) sampling scheduling, which exploits the sensor network redundancy to increase the effective sample processing rate, and (4) harvesting-aware energy management, which exploits sensor energy harvesting capabilities to extend the system lifetime. Our evaluation shows the performance of our systems over a range of scenarios, and demonstrate that the feasibility and benefits of a hybrid systems approach justify the additional system complexity.",

Due to the ad hoc nature of the BAN and the extreme resource constraints of sensor devices, providing secure as well as efficient and user-friendly trust initialization is a challenging task. Traditional solutions for wireless sensor networks mostly depend on key predistribution, which is unsuitable for a BAN in many ways. In this article, we propose group device pairing (GDP), a user-aided multi-party authenticated key agreement protocol. Through GDP, a group of sensor devices that have no pre-shared secrets establish initial trust by generating various shared secret keys out of an unauthenticated channel. Devices authenticate themselves to each other with the aid of a human user who performs visual verifications.

With this model, we employ a feedback-based transmission power control algorithm to dynamically maintain individual link quality over time. The intellectual contribution of this work lies in a novel pairwise transmission power control, which is significantly different from existing node-level or network-level power control methods. Also different from most existing simulation work, the ATPC design is guided by extensive field experiments of link quality dynamics at various locations over a long period of time. The results from the real-world experiments demonstrate that (1) with pairwise adjustment, ATPC achieves more energy savings with a finer tuning capability, and (2) with online control, ATPC is robust even with environmental changes over time.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of planning the motion of “data mules” for collecting the data from stationary sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. Use of data mules significantly reduces energy consumption at sensor nodes compared to commonly used multihop forwarding approaches, but has a drawback in that it increases the latency of data delivery. Optimizing the motion of data mules, including path and speed, is critical for improving the data delivery latency and making the data mule approach more useful in practice. In this article, we focus on the path selection problem: finding the optimal path of data mules so that the data delivery latency can be minimized. We formulate the path selection problem as a graph problem that is capable of expressing the benefit from larger communication range. The problem is NP-hard and we present approximation algorithms for both single-data mule case and multiple-data mules case. We further consider the case in which we have only partial knowledge of communication range, where we design semionline algorithms that improve the offline plan using online knowledge at runtime. Simulation experiments on Matlab and ns2 demonstrate that our offline and semionline algorithms produce significantly shorter path lengths and data delivery latency compared to previously proposed methods, suggesting that controlled mobility can be exploited much more effectively.",

In this article, we study the deployment of the minimum number of mobile charging vehicles to charge sensors in a large-scale WSN so that none of the sensors will run out of energy, for which we first advocate a flexible on-demand charging paradigm that decouples sensor energy charging scheduling from the design of sensing data routing protocols. We then formulate a novel optimization problem of scheduling mobile charging vehicles to charge life-critical sensors in the network with an objective to minimize the number of mobile charging vehicles deployed, subject to the energy capacity constraint on each mobile charging vehicle. As the problem is NP-hard, we instead propose an approximation algorithm with a provable performance guarantee if the energy consumption of each sensor during each charging tour is negligible. Otherwise, we devise a heuristic algorithm by modifying the proposed approximation algorithm. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are very promising, and the solutions obtained are fractional of the optimal ones.

    "abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables numerous in-vehicle applications for smart cities, driving increasing service demands for processing various contents (e.g., videos). Generally, for efficient service delivery, the contents from the service providers are processed on the edge servers (ESs), as edge computing offers vehicular applications low-latency services. However, due to the reusability of the same contents required by different distributed vehicular users, processing the copies of the same contents repeatedly in an edge server leads to a waste of resources (e.g., storage, computation, and bandwidth) in ESs. Therefore, it is a challenge to provide high-quality services while guaranteeing the resource efficiency with edge content caching. To address the challenge, an edge content caching method for smart cities with service requirement prediction, named E-Cache, is proposed. First, the future service requirements from the vehicles are predicted based on the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet). Then, preliminary content caching schemes are elaborated based on the predicted service requirements, which are further adjusted by a many-objective optimization aiming at minimizing the execution time and the energy consumption of the vehicular services. Eventually, experimental evaluations prove the efficiency and effectiveness of E-Cache with spatiotemporal traffic trajectory big data.",

We show that the mmWave signals can be directed to human’s body and the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of the reflections can be analyzed for accurate estimation of breathing and heart rates. We show how the directional beams of mmWave can be used to monitor multiple humans in an indoor space concurrently. mmVital also provides sleep monitoring with sleeping posture identification and detection of central apnea and hypopnea events. It relies on a novel human finding procedure where a human can be located within a room by reflection loss-based object/human classification. We evaluate mmVital using a 60GHz testbed in home and office environment and show that it provides the mean estimation error of 0.43 breaths per minute (Bpm; breathing rate) and 2.15 beats per minute (bpm; heart rate).

    "abstract": "Opportunistic routing is widely known to have substantially better performance than unicast routing in wireless networks with lossy links. However, wireless sensor networks are usually duty cycled, that is, they frequently enter sleep states to ensure long network lifetime. This renders existing opportunistic routing schemes impractical, as they assume that nodes are always awake and can overhear other transmissions. In this article we introduce ORW, a practical opportunistic routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. ORW uses a novel opportunistic routing metric, EDC, that reflects the expected number of duty-cycled wakeups that are required to successfully deliver a packet from source to destination. We devise distributed algorithms that find the EDC-optimal forwarding and demonstrate using analytical performance models and simulations that EDC-based opportunistic routing results in significantly reduced delay and improved energy efficiency compared to traditional unicast routing. In addition, we evaluate the performance of ORW in both simulations and testbed-based experiments. Our results show that ORW reduces radio duty cycles on average by 50% (up to 90% on individual nodes) and delays by 30% to 90% when compared to the state-of-the-art.",

An aggregation operation is holistic if there is no constant bound on the size of the storage needed to describe a sub-aggregation. Since holistic aggregation cannot be distributable, it requires that all the sensory data should be sent to the sink in order to obtain the exact holistic aggregation results, which costs lots of energy. However, in most applications, exact holistic aggregation results are not necessary; instead, approximate results are acceptable. To save energy as much as possible, we study the approximated holistic aggregation algorithms based on uniform sampling. In this article, four holistic aggregation operations, frequency, distinct-count, rank, and quantile, are investigated. The mathematical methods to construct their estimators and determine optional sample size are proposed, and the correctness of these methods are proved. Four corresponding distributed holistic algorithms to derive (ϵ, δ)-approximate aggregation results are given.

Fortunately, edge computing can optimize problems such as delay and connectivity by offloading part of the computational tasks to edge nodes close to the data source. Using this feature, IoT devices can save more resources while still maintaining the quality of service. However, since computation offloading decisions concern joint and complex resource management, we use multiple Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents deployed on IoT devices to guide their own decisions. Besides, Federated Learning (FL) is utilized to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion, aiming to make the DRL-based decision making practical and further decrease the transmission cost between IoT devices and Edge Nodes. In this article, we first study the problem of computation offloading optimization and prove the problem is an NP-hard problem. Then, based on DRL and FL, we propose an offloading algorithm that is different from the traditional method. Finally, we studied the effects of various parameters on the performance of the algorithm and verified the effectiveness of both the DRL and FL in the IoT system.",

    "abstract": "The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) . This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) . In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 × 200 × 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.",

To achieve this goal, we propose Concurrent Low-power Listening (CLPL) to enable contention-tolerant and concurrent media access control (MAC) for widely deployed low-power devices. The fundamental principle behind CLPL is that frequency modulated receiver can reliably demodulate the strongest signal even if cochannel interference and noise exist. By using CLPL, a sender inserts a series of tailor-made signals (namely, wake-up signal) between adjacent data frames to awaken appointed receiver, making it capable to receive the next data frame. According to system-defined maximum transmission power level, CLPL adopts an adaptive algorithm to adjust the transmission power of wake-up signals so that its signal strength is above receiver sensitivity and will not interfere with the other data frames in transit. By exploiting the spatial-temporal correlation, we further develop a light-weight wake-up signal detection method to enable a waiting sender to accurately identify the current channel condition. Then, it schedules the sender’s data frame transmissions by overlapping with those wake-up signals, without conflicting with existing data frame transmissions. We have implemented the prototype of CLPL and conducted extensive experiments on a real testbed. In comparison with the state-of-the-art low-power MAC schemes, such as ContikiMAC, A-MAC, BoX-MAC, and opportunistic scheme ORW, CLPL can improve the throughput by 2–6 times and halve the end-to-end transmission delay.",

ClusterFL features a novel clustered multi-task federated learning framework that minimizes the empirical training loss of multiple learned models while automatically capturing the intrinsic clustering relationship among the nodes. We theoretically prove the convergence of proposed FL framework for non-convex and strongly convex models and provide the guidance on selection of hyper-parameters for achieving such convergence. Based on the learned cluster relationship, ClusterFL can efficiently drop the nodes that converge slower or have little correlations with others in each cluster, significantly speeding up the convergence while maintaining the accuracy performance. We evaluate the performance of ClusterFL on an NVIDIA edge testbed using four new HAR datasets collected from 145 users.

The ad hoc –based CPS provides a promising architecture due to its decentralized nature and destructive-resistance. A growing number of information leakage events in CPSs and the following serious consequences have aroused ubiquitous concern about information security. In this article, we combine physical layer security solutions and millimeter-wave (mmWave) techniques to safeguard the ad hoc network and investigate the reliability-security tradeoff by taking user demands for the network into account, where eavesdroppers attempt to intercept messages. For the secrecy enhancements, we adopt an artificial noise (AN) assisted transmission scheme, in which AN is employed to create non-cancellable interference to eavesdroppers. The reliability and security are correspondingly characterized by the connection outage probability and secrecy outage probability, and their analytical expressions of them are attained through theoretical analysis for the purpose of the tradeoff issue discussion. Our results reveal that secrecy performance in mmWave ad hoc networks gains significant improvement through the use of AN. It also shows that given total transmit power, there exists a tradeoff between reliability and security to achieve optimal outage performance.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural irrigation is a significant contributor to freshwater consumption. However, the current irrigation systems used in the field are not efficient. They rely mainly on soil moisture sensors and the experience of growers but do not account for future soil moisture loss. Predicting soil moisture loss is challenging because it is influenced by numerous factors, including soil texture, weather conditions, and plant characteristics. This article proposes a solution to improve irrigation efficiency, which is called DRLIC (deep reinforcement learning for irrigation control). DRLIC is a sophisticated irrigation system that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize its performance. The system employs a neural network, known as the DRL control agent, which learns an optimal control policy that considers both the current soil moisture measurement and the future soil moisture loss. We introduce an irrigation reward function that enables our control agent to learn from previous experiences. However, there may be instances in which the output of our DRL control agent is unsafe, such as irrigating too much or too little. To avoid damaging the health of the plants, we implement a safety mechanism that employs a soil moisture predictor to estimate the performance of each action. If the predicted outcome is deemed unsafe, we perform a relatively conservative action instead. To demonstrate the real-world application of our approach, we develop an irrigation system that comprises sprinklers, sensing and control nodes, and a wireless network. We evaluate the performance of DRLIC by deploying it in a testbed consisting of six almond trees. During a 15-day in-field experiment, we compare the water consumption of DRLIC with a widely used irrigation scheme. Our results indicate that DRLIC outperforms the traditional irrigation method by achieving water savings of up to 9.52%.",

The localization accuracy of the system in open terrain is competitive with that of existing centralized countersniper systems. However, the presented sensor network-based solution surpasses the traditional approach because it can mitigate acoustic multipath effects prevalent in urban areas and it can also resolve multiple simultaneous shots. These unique characteristics of the system are made possible by employing novel sensor fusion techniques that utilize the spatial and temporal diversity of multiple detections. In this article, in addition to the overall system architecture, the middleware services and the unique sensor fusion algorithms are described.

    "abstract": "Many key predistribution techniques have been developed recently to establish pairwise keys between sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. To further improve these schemes, researchers have also proposed to take advantage of the sensors' expected locations and discovered locations to help the predistribution of the keying materials. However, in many cases, it is very difficult to deploy sensor nodes at their expected locations or guarantee the correct location discovery at sensor nodes in hostile environments. In this article, a group-based deployment model is developed to improve key predistribution. In this model, sensor nodes are only required to be deployed in groups. The critical observation in the article is that the sensor nodes in the same group are usually close to each other after deployment . This deployment model is practical; it greatly simplifies the deployment of sensor nodes, while still providing an opportunity to improve key predistribution. Specifically, the article presents a novel framework for improving key predistribution using the group-based deployment knowledge. This framework does not require the knowledge of the sensors' expected or discovered locations and is thus suitable for applications where it is difficult to deploy the sensor nodes at their expected locations or correctly estimate the sensors' locations after deployment. To seek practical key predistribution schemes, the article presents two efficient instantiations of this framework, a hash key-based scheme and a polynomial-based scheme . The evaluation shows that these two schemes are efficient and effective for pairwise key establishment in sensor networks; they can achieve much better performance than the previous key predistribution schemes when the sensor nodes are deployed in groups.",

With this in mind, researchers have designed a large number of sensor network protocols and algorithms that attempt to exploit such correlations.There is an increasing need to synthetically generate large traces of spatially correlated data representing a wide range of conditions to carefully study the performance of these algorithms. Further, a mathematical model for generating synthetic traces would provide guidelines for designing more efficient algorithms. These reasons motivate us to obtain a simple and accurate model of spatially correlated sensor network data.The proposed model is Markovian in nature and can capture correlation in data irrespective of the node density, the number of source nodes, or the topology. We describe a rigorous mathematical procedure and a simple practical method to extract the model parameters from real traces. We also show how to efficiently generate synthetic traces on a given topology using these parameters. The correctness of the model is verified by statistically comparing synthetic and real data. Further, the model is validated by comparing the performance of algorithms whose behavior depends on the degree of spatial correlation in data, under real and synthetic traces. The real traces are obtained from remote sensing data, publicly available sensor data, and sensor networks that we deploy. We show that the proposed model is more general and accurate than the commonly used jointly Gaussian model. Finally, we create tools that can be easily used by researchers to synthetically generate traces of any size and degree of correlation.",

Nevertheless, the few in-the-field experiences typically focus on the features of a specific system, and rarely report about the characteristics of the target environment, especially with respect to the behavior and performance of low-power wireless communication. The TRITon project, funded by our local administration, aims to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs of road tunnels, using a WSN-based control infrastructure. The access to real tunnels within TRITon gives us the opportunity to experimentally assess the peculiarities of this environment, hitherto not investigated in the WSN field. We report about three deployments: (i) an operational road tunnel, enabling us to assess the impact of vehicular traffic; (ii) a nonoperational tunnel, providing insights into analogous scenarios (e.g., underground mines) without vehicles; (iii) a vineyard, serving as a baseline representative of the existing literature. Our setup, replicated in each deployment, uses mainstream WSN hardware, and popular MAC and routing protocols. We analyze and compare the deployments with respect to reliability, stability, and asymmetry of links, the accuracy of link quality estimators, and the impact of these aspects on MAC and routing layers. Our analysis shows that a number of criteria commonly used in the design of WSN protocols do not hold in tunnels. Therefore, our results are useful for designing networking solutions operating efficiently in similar environments.",

Our proposed approach is to select a small subset of sensor nodes that may be sufficient to reconstruct data for the entire sensor network. Then, during data gathering only the selected sensors need to be involved in communication. The selected set of sensors must also be connected, since they need to relay data to the data-gathering node. We define the problem of selecting such a set of sensors as the connected correlation-dominating set problem, and formulate it in terms of an appropriately defined correlation structure that captures general data correlations in a sensor network. We develop a set of energy-efficient distributed algorithms and competitive centralized heuristics to select a connected correlation-dominating set of small size. The designed distributed algorithms can be implemented in an asynchronous communication model, and can tolerate message losses. We also design an exponential (but nonexhaustive) centralized approximation algorithm that returns a solution within O (log n ) of the optimal size. Based on the approximation algorithm, we design a class of centralized heuristics that are empirically shown to return near-optimal solutions. Simulation results over randomly generated sensor networks with both artificially and naturally generated data sets demonstrate the efficiency of the designed algorithms and the viability of our technique—even in dynamic conditions.",

In this article, we present synopsis diffusion , a general framework for achieving significantly more accurate and reliable answers by combining energy-efficient multipath routing schemes with techniques that avoid double-counting. Synopsis diffusion avoids double-counting through the use of order- and duplicate-insensitive (ODI) synopses that compactly summarize intermediate results during in-network aggregation. We provide a surprisingly simple test that makes it easy to check the correctness of an ODI synopsis. We show that the properties of ODI synopses and synopsis diffusion create implicit acknowledgments of packet delivery. Such acknowledgments enable energy-efficient adaptation of message routes to dynamic message loss conditions, even in the presence of asymmetric links. Finally, we illustrate using extensive simulations the significant robustness, accuracy, and energy-efficiency improvements of synopsis diffusion over previous approaches.",

Based on a recently developed link loss model, we study the performance of a wide array of forwarding strategies, via analysis, extensive simulations and a set of experiments on motes.

    "abstract": "Low duty cycle operation is critical to conserve energy in wireless sensor networks. Traditional wake-up scheduling approaches either require periodic synchronization messages or incur high packet delivery latency due to the lack of any synchronization. To simultaneously achieve the seemingly contradictory goals of energy efficiency and low latency, the design of a new low duty-cycle MAC layer protocol called Convergent MAC (CMAC) is presented. CMAC avoids synchronization overhead while supporting low latency. By using zero communication when there is no traffic, CMAC allows sensor nodes to operate at very low duty cycles. When carrying traffic, CMAC first uses anycast to wake up forwarding nodes, and then converges gradually from route-suboptimal anycast with unsynchronized duty cycling to route-optimal unicast with synchronized scheduling. To validate our design and provide a usable module for the research community, CMAC has been implemented in TinyOS and evaluated on the Kansei testbed consisting of 105 XSM nodes. The results show that CMAC at 1% duty cycle significantly outperforms BMAC at 1% in terms of latency, throughput and energy efficiency. The performance of CMAC is also compared with other protocols using simulations, in which the results show for 1% and lower duty cycles, CMAC exhibits similar throughput and latency as CSMA/CA using much less energy, and outperforms SMAC, DMAC and GeRaF in almost all aspects.",

Within this context, this article concentrates on adaptive sampling as a means of focusing a sensor's energy consumption on obtaining the most important data. Specifically, we develop a principled information metric based upon Fisher information and Gaussian process regression that allows the information content of a sensor's observations to be expressed. We then use this metric to derive three novel decentralized control algorithms for information-based adaptive sampling which represent a trade-off in computational cost and optimality. These algorithms are evaluated in the context of a deployed sensor network in the domain of flood monitoring. The most computationally efficient of the three is shown to increase the value of information gathered by approximately 83%, 27%, and 8% per day compared to benchmarks that sample in a naïve nonadaptive manner, in a uniform nonadaptive manner, and using a state-of-the-art adaptive sampling heuristic (USAC) correspondingly. Moreover, our algorithm collects information whose total value is approximately 75% of the optimal solution (which requires an exponential, and thus impractical, amount of time to compute).",

    "abstract": "One of the useful approaches to exploit redundancy in a sensor network is to keep active only a small subset of sensors that are sufficient to cover the region required to be monitored. The set of active sensors should also form a connected communication graph, so that they can autonomously respond to application queries and/or tasks. Such a set of active sensors is known as a connected sensor cover, and the problem of selecting a minimum connected sensor cover has been well studied when the transmission radius and sensing radius of each sensor is fixed. In this article, we address the problem of selecting a minimum energy-cost connected sensor cover, when each sensor node can vary its sensing and transmission radius; larger sensing or transmission radius entails higher energy cost. For the aforesaid problem, we design various centralized and distributed algorithms, and compare their performance through extensive experiments. One of the designed centralized algorithms (called CGA) is shown to perform within an O (log n ) factor of the optimal solution, where n is the size of the network. We have also designed a localized algorithm based on Voronoi diagrams which is empirically shown to perform very close to CGA and, due to its communication-efficiency, results in significantly prolonging the network lifetime. We also extend the aforementioned algorithms to incorporate fault tolerance. In particular, we show how to extend the algorithms to address the minimum energy-cost connected sensor k -cover problem, in which every point in the query region needs to be covered by at least k distinct active sensors. The CGA preserves the approximation bound in this case. We also propose a localized topology control scheme to preserve k -connectivity, and use it to extend the Voronoi-based approach to computing a minimum energy-cost k 1 -connected k 2 -cover. We study the performance of our proposed algorithms through extensive simulations.",

In this article, we present Physiological Value-based Security (PVS), a usable and efficient way of securing intersensor communication schemes for BSNs. The PVS scheme distributes the key used for securing a particular message along with the message itself, by hiding it using physiological values. In this way, it not only eliminates the need for any explicit key distribution, but also reduces the number of keys required at each node to meet all its secure communication requirements. We further demonstrate the use of the PVS scheme in securing cluster topology formation in BSNs. Traditional protocols for cluster formation do not consider security and are therefore susceptible to malicious attacks. We present a PVS-based cluster formation protocol which mitigates these attacks. Performance analysis of the protocol shows that compared to cluster formation protocols secured with non-PVS-based key distribution schemes, it performs efficiently.",

However, due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task. In this article, we propose 4C, a novel link estimator that applies link quality prediction along with link estimation. Our approach is data driven and consists of three steps: data collection, offline modeling, and online prediction. The data collection step involves gathering link quality data, and based on our analysis of the data, we propose a set of guidelines for the amount of data to be collected in our experimental scenarios. The modeling step includes offline prediction model training and selection. We present three prediction models that utilize different machine learning methods, namely, naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. Our models take a combination of PRR and the physical-layer information, that is, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) as input, and output the success probability of delivering the next packet. From our analysis and experiments, we find that logistic regression works well among the three models with small computational cost. Finally, the third step involves the implementation of 4C, a receiver-initiated online link quality prediction module that computes the short temporal link quality. We conducted extensive experiments in the Motelab and our local indoor testbeds, as well as an outdoor deployment.

This article presents the design and implementation of multidimensional power management strategies in VigilNet, a major recent effort to support long-term surveillance using power-constrained sensor devices. A novel tripwire service is integrated with an effective sentry and duty cycle scheduling in order to increase the system lifetime, collaboratively. The tripwire service partitions a network into distinct, nonoverlapping sections and allows each section to be scheduled independently. Sentry scheduling selects a subset of nodes, the sentries, which are turned on while the remaining nodes save energy. Duty cycle scheduling allows the active sentries themselves to be turned on and off, further lowering the average power draw. The multidimensional power management strategies proposed in this article were fully implemented within a real sensor network system using the XSM platform. We evaluate key system parameters using a network of 200 XSM nodes in an outdoor environment, and an analytical probabilistic model. We evaluate network lifetime using a simulation of a 10,000-node network that uses measured XSM power values. These evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated approach and identify a set of lessons and guidelines, useful for the future development of energy-efficient sensor systems. One of the key results indicates that the combination of the three presented power management techniques is able to increase the lifetime of a realistic network from 4 days to 200 days.",

In this article, we discuss RCRT, a rate-controlled reliable transport protocol suitable for constrained sensor nodes. RCRT uses end-to-end explicit loss recovery, but places all the congestion detection and rate adaptation functionality in the sinks. This has two important advantages: efficiency and flexibility. Because sinks make rate allocation decisions, they are able to achieve greater efficiency since they have a more comprehensive view of network behavior. For the same reason, it is possible to alter the rate allocation decisions (for example, from one that ensures that all nodes get the same rate, to one that ensures that nodes get rates in proportion to their demands), without modifying sensor code at all. We evaluate RCRT extensively on a 40-node wireless sensor network testbed and show that RCRT achieves 1.7 times the rate achieved by IFRC and 1.4 times that of WRCP, two recently proposed interference-aware distributed rate-control protocols. We also present results from a 3-month-long 19-node real world deployment of RCRT in an imaging application and show that RCRT works well in real long-term deployments.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses the challenge of truth discovery from noisy social sensing data. The work is motivated by the emergence of social sensing as a data collection paradigm of growing interest, where humans perform sensory data collection tasks. Unlike the case with well-calibrated and well-tested infrastructure sensors, humans are less reliable, and the likelihood that participants' measurements are correct is often unknown a priori. Given a set of human participants of unknown trustworthiness together with their sensory measurements, we pose the question of whether one can use this information alone to determine, in an analytically founded manner, the probability that a given measurement is true. In our previous conference paper, we offered the first maximum likelihood solution to the aforesaid truth discovery problem for corroborating observations only. In contrast, this article extends the conference paper and provides the first maximum likelihood solution to handle the cases where measurements from different participants may be conflicting . The article focuses on binary measurements. The approach is shown to outperform our previous work used for corroborating observations, the state-of-the-art fact-finding baselines, as well as simple heuristics such as majority voting.",

    "abstract": "Reducing energy consumption within buildings has been an active area of research in the past decade; more recently, there has been an increased influx of activity, motivated by a variety of issues including legislative, tax-related, as well as an increased awareness of energy-related issues. Energy usage both in commercial and residential buildings represents a significant portion of overall energy consumption; however, much of this may be categorized as waste, that is, energy usage that does not fulfil a definite purpose. In the past decade, the viability of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies has been demonstrated, leading to increased possibilities for novel services for building energy management. This development has resulted in numerous approaches being proposed for harnessing WSNs for energy management and conservation. This article surveys the state-of-the-art in building energy management systems. A generic architecture is proposed after which a detailed taxonomy of existing documented systems is presented. Gaps in the literature are highlighted and directions for future research identified.",

In order to save energy in the transfer of data from the sensor nodes to one or more sinks, the data may be routed through other nodes rather than transmitting it directly to the sink(s). In this article, we investigate the problem of energy-efficient transmission of data over a noisy channel, focusing on the setting of physical-layer parameters. We derive a metric called the energy per successfully received bit, which specifies the expected energy required to transmit a bit successfully over a particular distance given a channel noise model. By minimizing this metric, we can find, for different modulation schemes, the energy-optimal relay distance and the optimal transmit energy as a function of channel noise level and path loss exponent. These results enable network designers to select the hop distance, transmit power, and/or modulation scheme that maximize network lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Position information plays a pivotal role in wireless sensor network (WSN) applications and protocol/algorithm design. In recent years, range-free localization algorithms have drawn much research attention due to their low cost and applicability to large-scale WSNs. However, the application of range-free localization algorithms is restricted because of their dramatic accuracy degradation in practical anisotropic WSNs, which is mainly caused by large error of distance estimation. Distance estimation in the existing range-free algorithms usually relies on a unified per hop length (PHL) metric between nodes. But the PHL between different nodes might be greatly different in anisotropic WSNs, resulting in large error in distance estimation. We find that, although the PHL between different nodes might be greatly different, it exhibits significant locality ; that is, nearby nodes share a similar PHL to anchors that know their positions in advance. Based on the locality of the PHL, a novel distance estimation approach is proposed in this article. Theoretical analyses show that the error of distance estimation in the proposed approach is only one-fourth of that in the state-of-the-art pattern-driven scheme (PDS). An anchor selection algorithm is also devised to further improve localization accuracy by mitigating the negative effects from the anchors that are poorly distributed in geometry. By combining the locality-based distance estimation and the anchor selection, a range-free localization algorithm named &lt;underline&gt;S&lt;/underline&gt;elective &lt;underline&gt;M&lt;/underline&gt;ultilateration (SM) is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that SM achieves localization accuracy higher than 0.3 r , where r is the communication radius of nodes. Compared to the state-of-the-art solution, SM improves the distance estimation accuracy by up to 57% and improves localization accuracy by up to 52% consequently.",

    "abstract": "Visual sensor networks (VSNs) are becoming increasingly popular in a number of application domains. A distinguishing characteristic of VSNs is to self-configure to minimize the need for operator control and to improve scalability. One of the areas of self-configuration is camera coverage control that is, how should cameras adjust their field-of-views to cover maximum targets? This is an NP-hard problem. We show that the existing heuristics have a number of weaknesses that influence both coverage and overhead. Therefore, we first propose a computationally efficient centralized heuristic that provides near-optimal coverage for small-scale networks. However, it requires significant communication and computation overhead, making it unsuitable for large-scale networks. Thus, we develop a distributed algorithm that outperforms the existing distributed algorithm with lower communication overhead, at the cost of coverage accuracy. We show that the proposed heuristics guarantee to cover at least half of the targets covered by the optimal solution. Finally, to gain benefits of both centralized and distributed algorithms, we propose a hierarchical algorithm where cameras are decomposed into neighborhoods that coordinate their coverage using an elected local coordinator. We observe that the hierarchical algorithm provides scalable near-optimal coverage with networking cost significantly less than that of centralized and distributed solutions.",

Unfortunately, fresh food T8D not only suffers from significant spoilage and waste, but also from dismal efficiency due to tight transit timing constraints between the availability of harvested food until its delivery to the retailer. Fresh food is also easily contaminated, and together with deteriorated fresh food is responsible for much of food-borne illnesses. The logistics operations are undergoing rapid transformation on multiple fronts, including infusion of information technology in the logistics operations, automation in the physical product handling, standardization of labeling, addressing and packaging, and shared logistics operations under 3rd party logistics (3PL) and related models. In this article, we discuss how these developments can be exploited to turn fresh food logistics into an intelligent cyberphysical system driven by online monitoring and associated operational control to enhance food freshness and safety, reduce food waste, and increase T8D efficiency. Some of the issues discussed in this context are fresh food quality deterioration processes, food quality/contamination sensing technologies, communication technologies for transmitting sensed data through the challenging fresh food media, intelligent management of the T8D pipeline, and various other operational issues. The purpose of this article is to stimulate further research in this important emerging area that lies at the intersection of computing and logistics.",

    "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) refers to the process of implementing a damage detection and characterization strategy for engineering structures. Its objective is to monitor the integrity of structures and detect and pinpoint the locations of possible damages. Although wired network systems still dominate in SHM applications, it is commonly believed that wireless sensor network (WSN) systems will be deployed for SHM in the near future, due to their intrinsic advantages. However, the constraints (e.g., communication, fault tolerance, energy) of WSNs must be considered before their deployment on structures. In this article, we study the methodology of sensor placement optimization for WSN-based SHM. Sensor placement plays a vital role in SHM applications, where sensor nodes are placed on critical locations that are of civil/structural engineering importance. We design a three-phase sensor placement approach, named TPSP, aiming to achieve the following objectives: finding a high-quality placement for a given set of sensors that satisfies the engineering requirements, ensuring communication efficiency and reliability and low placement complexity, and reducing the probability of failures in a WSN. Along with the sensor placement, we enable sensor nodes to develop “connectivity trees” in such a way that maintaining structural health state and network connectivity, for example, in case of a sensor fault, can be done in a distributed manner. The trees are constructed once (unlike dynamic clusters or trees) and do not incur additional communication costs for the WSN. We optimize the performance of TPSP by considering multiple objectives: low communication cost, fault tolerance, and lifetime prolongation. We validate the effectiveness and performance of TPSP through both simulations using real datasets and a proof-of-concept system on a physical structure.",

However, the sensory data provided by individual participants are usually not reliable. To better utilize such sensory data, the topic of truth discovery, whose goal is to estimate user quality and infer reliable aggregated results through quality-aware data aggregation, has drawn significant attention. Though able to improve aggregation accuracy, existing truth discovery approaches fail to address the privacy concerns of individual users. In this article, we propose a novel privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPTD) framework, which can protect not only users’ sensory data but also their reliability scores derived by the truth discovery approaches. The key idea of the proposed framework is to perform weighted aggregation on users’ encrypted data using a homomorphic cryptosystem, which can guarantee both high accuracy and strong privacy protection. In order to deal with large-scale data, we also propose to parallelize PPTD with MapReduce framework. Additionally, we design an incremental PPTD scheme for the scenarios where the sensory data are collected in a streaming manner. Extensive experiments based on two real-world crowd sensing systems demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate accurate aggregated results while protecting users’ private information.",

First, a novel generic mathematical definition of Energy Efficiency (EE) is proposed, which takes the acquisition rate of valid data, the total energy consumption, and the network lifetime of WSNs into consideration simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the EE of WSNs is mathematically defined. The energy consumption characteristics of each individual sensor node and the whole network are expounded at length. Accordingly, the concepts concerning EE, namely the Energy-Efficient Means, the Energy-Efficient Tier, and the Energy-Efficient Perspective, are proposed. Subsequently, the relevant energy-efficient strategies proposed from 2002 to 2019 are tracked and reviewed. Specifically, they respectively are classified into five categories: the Energy-Efficient Media Access Control protocol, the Mobile Node Assistance Scheme, the Energy-Efficient Clustering Scheme, the Energy-Efficient Routing Scheme, and the Compressive Sensing--based Scheme. A detailed elaboration on both of the basic principle and the evolution of them is made. Finally, further analysis on the categories is made and the related conclusion is drawn. To be specific, the interdependence among them, the relationships between each of them, and the Energy-Efficient Means, the Energy-Efficient Tier, and the Energy-Efficient Perspective are analyzed in detail. In addition, the specific applicable scenarios for each of them and the relevant statistical analysis are detailed.

    "abstract": "Energy-neutral Internet of Things requires freeing embedded devices from batteries and powering them from ambient energy. Ambient energy is, however, unpredictable and can only power a device intermittently. Therefore, the paradigm of intermittent execution is to save the program state into non-volatile memory frequently to preserve the execution progress. In task-based intermittent programming, the state is saved at task transition. Tasks are fixed at compile time and agnostic to energy conditions. Thus, the state may be saved either more often than necessary or not often enough for the program to progress and terminate. To address these challenges, we propose Coala, an adaptive and efficient task-based execution model. Coala progresses on a multi-task scale when energy permits and preserves the computation progress on a sub-task scale if necessary. Coala’s specialized memory virtualization mechanism ensures that power failures do not leave the program state in non-volatile memory inconsistent. Our evaluation on a real energy-harvesting platform not only shows that Coala reduces runtime by up to 54% as compared to a state-of-the-art system, but also it is able to progress where static systems fail.",

Combined together, those two bring Bluetooth to a brand new stage. However, current works related to it only focus on part of the new Bluetooth, and discussion over the entire one is lacking. Therefore, in this survey, we conduct an investigation toward the new Bluetooth from a comprehensive perspective. Through this, we show that the new Bluetooth not only consolidates its strengths in original application fields but also brings alterations and opportunities to new ones, making it a strong competitor in the future for providing complete solutions to meet the demands of seamless communications in the Internet of Things area.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a comprehensive survey of pioneer and state-of-the-art localization algorithms based on the mobility of the network. The basic concepts of the localization task in a wireless sensor network are revisited and the most common techniques suitable for random mobility are reviewed. This survey compiles and discusses the most relevant algorithms regarding localization in mobile networks, focusing on scenarios where nodes have no control over their mobility and hardware restrictions are imposed, including recent advances in learning-based solutions. It focuses on presenting techniques that do not rely on human intervention or a specialized field configuration. This unpredictability brings challenges that are not present in a static network nor in a mobile network built upon robotic entities. The basis for theoretical concepts of localization algorithms is gathered and organized in a comprehensive way, so researchers may quickly get started in this field. Significant aspects addressed throughout the article, such as mobility pattern, range scheme, and computational complexity are organized and discussed as well as performance data for quantitative analysis alongside related ponderations. This survey concludes by pointing out current and future trends.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become an indispensable technology to bridge vehicles, persons, and infrastructures and is promising to make our cities smarter and more connected. It enables vehicles to exchange vehicular data (e.g., GPS, sensors, and brakes) with different entities nearby. However, sharing these vehicular data over the air raises concerns about identity privacy leakage. Besides, the centralized architecture adopted in existing IoV systems is fragile to single point-of-failure and malicious attacks. With the emergence of blockchain technology, there is the chance to solve these problems due to its features of being tamper-proof, traceability, and decentralization. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving vehicular data sharing framework based on blockchain. In particular, we design an anonymous and auditable data sharing scheme using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology so as to protect the identity privacy of vehicles while preserving the vehicular data auditability for Trusted Authorities (TAs). In response to high mobility of vehicles, we design an efficient multi-sharding protocol to decrease blockchain communication costs without compromising the blockchain security. We implement a prototype of our framework and conduct extensive experiments and simulations on it. Evaluation and analysis results indicate that our framework can not only strengthen system security and data privacy but also reduce communication complexity by \\(O(\\frac{n\\sqrt {m}}{m^2})\\) times compared to existing sharding protocols.",

The zero-trust distributed system combined with blockchain technology has become a hot topic in IoT research. However, distribution data storage services and different blockchain protocols make network interoperability and cross-platform more complex. Relay chain is a promising cross-chain technology that solves the complexity and compatibility issues associated with blockchain cross-chain transactions by utilizing relay blockchains as cross-chain connectors. Yet relay chain cross-chain transactions need to collect asset information and implement asset transactions via two-way peg. Due to the release of user transaction information, there is the issue of privacy leakage. In this article, we propose a cross-chain privacy protection protocol based on the Groth16 zero-knowledge proof algorithm and coin-mixing technology, which changes the authentication mechanism and uses a combination of generating functions to map virtual external addresses in transactions. It allows fast cross-chain anonymous transactions while hiding the genuine user’s address. The experiment shows that, in a zero-trust IoT context, our scheme can effectively protect user privacy information, accomplish controlled transaction traceability operations, and guarantee cross-chain transaction security.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the number of devices and terminals connected to the smart city has increased significantly. Edge networks face a greater variety of connected objects and massive services. Considering that a large number of services have different QoS requirements, it has always been a huge challenge for smart city to optimally allocate limited computing resources to all services to obtain satisfactory performance. In particular, delay is intolerable for services in certain applications, such as medical, industrial applications, etc, that such applications require the high priority. Therefore, through flexibly dynamic scheduling, it is crucial to schedule services to the optimal node to ensure user experience. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for hierarchical edge computing network in smart city based on attention mechanism, for extracting a small number of features that can represent services from a large amount of information collected from edge nodes. The attention mechanism is used to quickly determine the priority of the services. Based on this, task deployment and resource allocation for different task priorities are developed to ensure the quality of service in smart cities by introducing Q-learning. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the edge network resource utilization, reduce the average delay of task processing, and effectively guarantee the quality of service.",

The key challenge in using a mobile observer is that it remains within communication range of any sensor for a brief duration, and inability to transfer data in this duration leads to data loss. We establish that the process of data collection can be modeled by a queue with deadlines, where arrivals correspond to the observer entering the range of a sensor and a missed deadline means data loss. The queuing model is then used to identify the combination of system parameters that ensures adequate data collection with minimum power. The results obtained from the queuing analogy take a simple form in the asymptotic regime of dense sensor networks. Additionally, for sensor networks that cannot tolerate data loss, we derive a tight bound on minimum sensor separation that ensures that no data will be lost on account of mobility. We present two examples to illustrate our results, from which it is seen that power reduction by two orders of magnitude or more is typical relative to a static sensor network. The scenarios chosen for power comparisons also provide guidelines on the choice of path, if such a choice is available.",

Emstar is designed to leverage the additional resources of Microservers by trading off some performance for system robustness in sensor network applications. It enables fault isolation, fault tolerance, system visiblity, in-field debugging, and resource sharing across multiple applications. In order to accomplish these objectives, Emstar is designed to run as a multiprocess system and consists of libraries that implement message-passing IPC primitives, services that support networking, sensing, and time synchronization, and tools that support simulation, emulation, and visualization of live systems, both real and simulated. We evaluate this work by discussing the Acoustic ENSBox, a platform for distributed acoustic sensing that we built using Emstar. We show that by leveraging existing Emstar services, we are able to significantly reduce development time while achieving a high degree of robustness.

We offer, along the way, a primer for those interested in the field of cryptography for sensor networks. We discuss, in particular, the decisions underlying our design and alternatives thereto. And we elaborate on the methodologies underlying our evaluation. Through instrumentation of UC Berkeley's TinySec module, we argue that, although symmetric cryptography has been tractable in this domain for some time, there has remained a need, unfulfilled until recently, for an efficient, secure mechanism for distribution of secret keys among nodes. Although public-key infrastructure has been thought impractical, we show, through analysis of our original implementation for TinyOS of point multiplication on elliptic curves, that public-key infrastructure is indeed viable for TinySec keys' distribution, even on the MICA2. We demonstrate that public keys can be generated within 34 seconds and that shared secrets can be distributed among nodes in a sensor network within the same time, using just over 1 kilobyte of SRAM and 34 kilobytes of ROM. We demonstrate that communication costs are minimal, with only 2 packets required for transmission of a public key among nodes.

A major challenge with respect to such networks is to figure out the correct network layout, that is, avoid global flips where a part of the network folds on top of another. Our algorithm first selects landmarks on network boundaries with sufficient density, then constructs the landmark Voronoi diagram and its dual combinatorial Delaunay complex on these landmarks. The key insight is that the combinatorial Delaunay complex is provably globally rigid and has a unique realization in the plane. Thus an embedding of the landmarks by simply gluing the Delaunay triangles properly recovers the faithful network layout. With the landmarks nicely localized, the rest of the nodes can easily localize themselves by trilateration to nearby landmark nodes. This leads to a practical and accurate localization algorithm for large networks using only network connectivity. Simulations on various network topologies show surprisingly good results. In comparison, previous connectivity-based localization algorithms such as multidimensional scaling and rubberband representation generate globally flipped or distorted localization results.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative communications represent a potential candidate to combat the effects of channel fading and to increase the transmit energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks with the downside being the increased complexity. In sensor networks the power consumed in the receiving and processing circuitry can constitute a significant portion of the total consumed power. By taking into consideration such overhead, an analytical framework for studying the energy efficiency trade-off of cooperation in sensor networks is presented. This trade-off is shown to depend on several parameters such as the receive and processing power, the required quality-of-service, the power amplifier loss, and several other factors. The analytical and numerical results reveal that for small distance separation between the source and destination, direct transmission is more energy efficient than relaying. The results also reveal that equal power allocation performs as well as optimal power allocation for some scenarios. The effects of the relay location and the number of employed relays on energy efficiency are also investigated in this work.

    "abstract": "In this article we consider deploying a sensor network to help an agent navigate in an area. In particular the agent uses range measurements to the sensors to localize itself. We wish to place the sensors in order to provide optimal localization accuracy to the agent. We begin by considering the problem of placing sensors in order to optimally localize the agent at a single location. The Position Error Bound (PEB), a lower bound on the localization accuracy, is used to measure the quality of sensor configurations. We then present RELOCATE, an iterative algorithm that places the sensors so as to minimize the PEB at that point. When the range measurements are unbiased and have constant variances, we introduce a coordinate transform that allows us to obtain a closed-form solution to minimizing the PEB along one coordinate. We also prove that RELOCATE converges to the global minimum, and we compute the approximate expected rate of convergence of the algorithm. We then apply RELOCATE to the more complex case where the variance of the range measurements depends on the sensors location and where those measurements can be biased. We finally apply RELOCATE to the case where the PEB must be minimized not at a single point, but at multiple locations, so that good localization accuracy is ensured as the agent moves through the area. We show that, compared to Simulated Annealing, the algorithm yields better results faster on these more realistic scenarios. We also show that by optimally placing the sensors, significant savings in terms of number of sensors used can be achieved. Finally we illustrate that the PEB is not only a convenient theoretical lower bound, but that it can actually be closely approximated by a maximum likelihood estimator.",

This article addresses that void for low data-rate applications where collisions are of little concern, making an analytical approach tractable in which latency and energy consumption are modeled as a function of key protocol parameters (duty cycle, slot length, number of slots, etc.). By exhaustive search we determine the Pareto-optimal protocol settings for a given workload (data rate, network topology). Of the protocols compared we find that WiseMAC strikes the best latency vs. energy-consumption trade-off across the range of workloads considered.

The resulting data streams often exhibit incorrect data measurements and missing values. Identifying and correcting these is time-consuming and error-prone. We present a method for real-time automated data quality control (QC) that exploits the spatial and temporal correlations in the data to distinguish sensor failures from valid observations. The model adapts to each deployment site by learning a Bayesian network structure that captures spatial relationships between sensors, and it extends the structure to a dynamic Bayesian network to incorporate temporal correlations. This model is able to flag faulty observations and predict the true values of the missing or corrupt readings. The performance of the model is evaluated on data collected by the SensorScope Project. The results show that the spatiotemporal model demonstrates clear advantages over models that include only temporal or only spatial correlations, and that the model is capable of accurately imputing corrupted values.",

The question \"which protocol is best?\" is difficult to answer because (i) this depends on specific details of the application requirements and hardware characteristics involved, and (ii) protocols have mainly been assessed individually with each outperforming the canonical S-MAC protocol, but with different simulators, hardware platforms, and workloads. This article addresses that void for low data-rate applications where collisions are of little concern, making an analytical approach tractable in which latency and energy consumption are modeled as a function of key protocol parameters (duty cycle, slot length, number of slots, etc.). By exhaustive search we determine the Pareto-optimal protocol settings for a given workload (data rate, network topology). Of the protocols compared we find that WiseMAC strikes the best latency vs. energy-consumption trade-off across the range of workloads considered. In particular, its random access scheme in combination with local synchronization does not only minimize protocol overhead, but also maximizes the available channel bandwidth.",

    "abstract": "For sensor networks deployed to monitor and report real events, event source anonymity is an attractive and critical security property, which unfortunately is also very difficult and expensive to achieve. This is not only because adversaries may attack against sensor source privacy through traffic analysis, but also because sensor networks are very limited in resources. As such, a practical trade-off between security and performance is desirable. In this article, for the first time we propose the notion of statistically strong source anonymity , under a challenging attack model where a global attacker is able to monitor the traffic in the entire network. We propose a scheme called FitProbRate , which realizes statistically strong source anonymity for sensor networks. We demonstrate the robustness of our scheme under various statistical tests that might be employed by the attacker to detect real events. Our analysis and simulation results show that our scheme, besides providing source anonymity, can significantly reduce real event reporting latency compared to two baseline schemes. However, the degree of source anonymity in the FitProbRate scheme might decrease as real message rate increases. We propose a dynamic mean scheme which has better performance under high real message rates. Simulation results show that the dynamic mean scheme is capable of increasing the attacker's false positive rate and decreasing the attacker's Bayesian detection rate significantly even under high-rate continuous real messages.",

A novel ant-colony inspired mechanism is used to learn the vision graph, that is, the camera neighbourhood relations, during runtime, which may then be used to optimise communication between cameras. The key benefits of our completely decentralised approach are on the one hand generating the vision graph online, enabling efficient deployment in unknown scenarios and camera network topologies, and on the other hand relying only on local information, increasing the robustness of the system. Since our market-based approach does not rely on a priori topology information, the need for any multicamera calibration can be avoided.

    "abstract": "RPL is an IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) designed to meet the requirements of a wide range of LLN applications including smart grid AMIs, home and building automation, industrial and environmental monitoring, health care, wireless sensor networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT) in general with thousands and millions of nodes interconnected through multihop mesh networks. RPL constructs tree-like routing topology rooted at an LLN border router (LBR) and supports bidirectional IPv6 communication to and from the mesh devices by providing both upward and downward routing over the routing tree. In this article, we focus on the interoperability of downward routing and supporting its two modes of operations (MOPs) defined in the RPL standard (RFC 6550). Specifically, we show that there exists a serious connectivity problem in RPL protocol when two MOPs are mixed within a single network, even for standard-compliant implementations, which may result in network partitions. To address this problem, this article proposes DualMOP-RPL , an enhanced version of RPL, which supports nodes with different MOPs for downward routing to communicate gracefully in a single RPL network while preserving the high bidirectional data delivery performance. DualMOP-RPL allows multiple overlapping RPL networks in the same geographical regions to cooperate as a single densely connected network even if those networks are using different MOPs. This will not only improve the link qualities and routing performances of the networks but also allow for network migrations and alternate routing in the case of LBR failures. We evaluate DualMOP-RPL through extensive simulations and testbed experiments and show that our proposal eliminates all the problems we have identified.",

    "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks, the spanning tree is usually used as a routing structure to collect data. In some situations, nodes do in-network aggregation to reduce transmissions, save energy, and maximize network lifetime. Because of the restricted energy of sensor nodes, how to build an aggregation tree of maximum lifetime is an important issue. It has been proved to be NP-complete in previous works. As shortest path spanning trees intuitively have short delay, it is imperative to find an energy-efficient shortest path tree for time-critical applications. In this article, we first study the problem of building maximum lifetime shortest path aggregation trees in wireless sensor networks. We show that when restricted to shortest path trees, building maximum lifetime aggregation trees can be solved in polynomial time. We present a centralized algorithm and design a distributed protocol for building such trees. Simulation results show that our approaches greatly improve the lifetime of the network and are very effective compared to other solutions. We extend our discussion to networks without aggregation and present interesting results.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a remarkable growth in the number of smart wearable devices. For many of these devices, an important security issue is to establish an authenticated communication channel between legitimate devices to protect the subsequent communications. Due to the wireless nature of the communication and the extreme resource constraints of sensor devices, providing secure, efficient, and user-friendly device pairing is a challenging task. Traditional solutions for device pairing mostly depend on key predistribution, which is unsuitable for wearable devices in many ways. In this article, we design Gait-Key, a shared secret key generation scheme that allows two legitimate devices to establish a common cryptographic key by exploiting users’ walking characteristics (gait). The intuition is that the sensors on different locations on the same body experience similar accelerometer signals when the user is walking. However, one main challenge is that the accelerometer also captures motion signals produced by other body parts (e.g., swinging arms). We address this issue by using the blind source separation technique to extract the informative signal produced by the unique gait patterns. Our experimental results show that Gait-Key can generate a common 128-bit key for two legitimate devices with 98.3% probability. To demonstrate the feasibility, the proposed key generation scheme is implemented on modern smartphones. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme can run in real time on modern mobile devices and incurs low system overhead.",

However, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task due to the notoriously dynamic and unpredictable wireless environment.

We propose to apply machine learning methods to predict the link quality in the near future to facilitate the utilization of intermediate links with frequent quality changes. Moreover, we show that, by using online learning methods, our adaptive link estimator (TALENT) adapts to network dynamics better than statically trained models without the need of a priori data collection for training the model before deployment. We implemented TALENT in TinyOS with Low-Power Listening (LPL) and conducted extensive experiments in three testbeds. Our experimental results show that the addition of TALENT increases the delivery efficiency 1.95 times on average compared with a 4B, state-of-the-art link quality estimator, as well as improves the end-to-end delivery rate when tested on three different wireless testbeds.",

The deployment and maintenance of such cabled systems is expensive and inflexible. It is, therefore, desirable to replace or augment these systems using wireless technology, which requires us to overcome significant technical challenges. Process automation and control applications are mission-critical and require timely and reliable data delivery, which is difficult to provide in industrial environments with harsh radio environments. In this article, we present the GINSENG system which implements performance control to allow us to use wireless sensor networks for mission-critical applications in industrial environments. GINSENG is a complete system solution that comprises on-node system software, network protocols, and back-end systems with sophisticated data processing capability. GINSENG assumes that a deployment can be carefully planned. A TDMA-based MAC protocol, tailored to the deployment environment, is employed to provide reliable and timely data delivery. Performance debugging components are used to unintrusively monitor the system performance and identify problems as they occur. The article reports on a real-world deployment of GINSENG in an especially challenging environment of an operational oil refinery in Sines, Portugal. We provide experimental results from this deployment and share the experiences gained. These results demonstate the use of GINSENG for sensing and actuation and allow an assessment of its ability to operate within the required performance bounds. We also identify shortcomings that manifested during the evaluation phase, thus giving a useful perspective on the challenges that have to be overcome in these harsh application settings.",

Hence, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted considerable attention from the research community as an efficient way to explore various kinds of environments. Sensor networks applications can be useful in different domains (terrestrial, underwater, space exploration, etc.). However, one of the major constraints in such networks is the energy consumption that increases when data transmission increases. Consequently, optimizing data transmission is one of the most significant criteria in WSNs that can conserve energy of sensors and extend network lifetime. In this article, we propose an efficient data transmission protocol that consists in two phases of data aggregation. Our proposed protocol searches, in the first phase, similarities between measures collected by each sensor. In the second phase, it uses distance-based functions to find similarity between sets of collected data. The main goal of these phases is to reduce the data transmitted from both sensors and cluster-heads (CHs) in a clustering-based scheme network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, experiments on real sensor data from both terrestrial and underwater networks have been conducted. Compared to other existing techniques, simulation and real experimentations show that our protocol can be effectively used to reduce data transmission and increase network lifetime, while still keeping data integrity of the collected data.",

First, due to the mobility of targets, a lot of sensors have to keep being active to track targets in all potential directions, which causes excessive energy consumption. Second, when there are holes in the deployment area, targets may fail to be detected when moving into holes. Third, when targets stay at certain positions for a long time, sensors surrounding them have to suffer heavier work pressure than do others, which leads to a bottleneck for the entire network. To solve these problems, a few mobile sensors are introduced to follow targets directly for tracking because the energy capacity of mobile sensors is less constrained and they can detect targets closely with high tracking quality. Based on a realistic detection model, a solution of scheduling mobile sensors and fixed sensors for target tracking is proposed. Moreover, the movement path of mobile sensors has a provable performance bound compared to the optimal solution. Results of extensive simulations show that mobile sensors can improve tracking quality even if holes exist in the area and can reduce energy consumption of sensors effectively.",

Although many privacy-preserving data aggregation schemes have been proposed to solve the problem, they still suffer from some security weaknesses or performance deficiency, such as lack of satisfactory data confidentiality and resistance to malicious data mining attack. To address these issues, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme (called PDAM) for IoT-enabled smart grids, which can support efficient data source authentication and integrity checking, secure dynamic user join and exit. Unlike existing schemes, the PDAM is resilient to the malicious data mining attack launched by internal or external attackers and can achieve perfect data confidentiality against not only a malicious aggregator but also a curious control center for an authorized user. The detailed security and performance analysis show that our proposed PDAM can satisfy several well-known security properties and desirable efficiency for a smart grid system. Moreover, the comparative studies and experiments demonstrate that the PDAM is superior to other recently proposed works in terms of both security and performance.",

    "abstract": "Gait, the walking manner of a person, has been perceived as a physical and behavioral trait for human identification. Compared with cameras and wearable sensors, Wi-Fi-based gait recognition is more attractive because Wi-Fi infrastructure is almost available everywhere and is able to sense passively without the requirement of on-body devices. However, existing Wi-Fi sensing approaches impose strong assumptions of fixed user walking trajectories, sufficient training data, and identification of already known users. In this article, we present GaitSense , a Wi-Fi-based human identification system, to overcome the above unrealistic assumptions. To deal with various walking trajectories and speeds, GaitSense first extracts target specific features that best characterize gait patterns and applies novel normalization algorithms to eliminate gait irrelevant perturbation in signals. On this basis, GaitSense reduces the training efforts in new deployment scenarios by transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. GaitSense also enables a distinct feature of illegal user identification by anomaly detection, making the system readily available for real-world deployment. Our implementation and evaluation with commodity Wi-Fi devices demonstrate a consistent identification accuracy across various deployment scenarios with little training samples, pushing the limit of gait recognition with Wi-Fi signals.",

    "abstract": "Current LoRa networks including those following the LoRaWAN specification use the primitive ALOHA mechanism for media access control due to LoRa’s lack of carrier sense capability. From our extensive measurements, the channel activity detection feature that was recently introduced to LoRa for energy-efficiently detecting preamble chirps can also detect payload chirps reliably. This sheds light on an efficient carrier-sense multiple access protocol that we refer to as LMAC for LoRa networks. This article presents the designs of three advancing versions of LMAC that respectively implement carrier-sense multiple access, and balance the communication loads among the channels defined by frequencies and spreading factors based on the end nodes’ local information and then additionally the gateway’s global information. Experiments on a 50-node lab testbed and a 16-node university deployment show that, compared with ALOHA, LMAC brings up to 2.2× goodput improvement and 2.4× reduction of radio energy per successfully delivered frame. Thus, should LoRaWAN’s ALOHA be replaced with LMAC, network performance boosts can be realized.",

    "abstract": "Sensing and communication technology has been used successfully in various event monitoring applications over the last two decades, especially in places where long-term manual monitoring is infeasible. However, the major applicability of this technology was mostly limited to terrestrial environments. On the other hand, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) opens a new space for the remote monitoring of underwater species and faunas, along with communicating with underwater vehicles, submarines, and so on. However, as opposed to terrestrial radio communication, underwater environment brings new challenges for reliable communication due to the high conductivity of the aqueous medium which leads to major signal absorption. In this paper, we provide a detailed technical overview of different underwater communication technologies, namely acoustic, magnetic, and visual light, along with their potentials and challenges in submarine environments. Detailed comparison among these technologies have also been laid out along with their pros and cons using real experimental results.",

Optimal working mode for device-to-device (D2D) communication is aimed at improving the quality of service with the frequency spectrum structure is of research areas in 5G. D2D communication working modes are selected to meet both the predefined system conditions and provide maximum throughput for the network. Due to the complexity of the direct solutions, we formulated the problem as an optimization problem and found the optimal working modes under different parameters of the system through extensive simulations. After determining the links’ optimal modes, we calculated the network throughput; because of selecting the best working modes, we obtained the highest throughput. A major finding from this research is that D2D communication pairs are more inclined to use full-duplex (FD) mode in short distances to meet system requirements, and so most communications take place in FD mode at these distances. According to these results, using FD communication at short distances offers better conditions and Quality of service (QoS) than QoS-D2D method.",

    "abstract": "Precision Swine Farming has the potential to directly benefit swine health and industry profit by automatically monitoring the growth and health of pigs. We introduce the first system to use structural vibration to track animals and the first system for automated characterization of piglet group activities, including nursing, sleeping, and active times. PigSense uses physical knowledge of the structural vibration characteristics caused by pig-activity-induced load changes to recognize different behaviors of the sow and piglets. For our system to survive the harsh environment of the farrowing pen for three months, we designed simple, durable sensors for physical fault tolerance, then installed many of them, pooling their data to achieve algorithmic fault tolerance even when some do stop working. The key focus of this work was to create a robust system that can withstand challenging environments, has limited installation and maintenance requirements, and uses domain knowledge to precisely detect a variety of swine activities in noisy conditions while remaining flexible enough to adapt to future activities and applications. We provided an extensive analysis and evaluation of all-round swine activities and scenarios from our one-year field deployment across two pig farms in Thailand and the USA. To help assess the risk of crushing, farrowing sicknesses, and poor maternal behaviors, PigSense achieves an average of 97.8% and 94% for sow posture and motion monitoring, respectively, and an average of 96% and 71% for ingestion and excretion detection. To help farmers monitor piglet feeding, starvation, and illness, PigSense achieves an average of 87.7%, 89.4%, and 81.9% in predicting different levels of nursing, sleeping, and being active, respectively. In addition, we show that our monitoring of signal energy changes allows the prediction of farrowing in advance, as well as status tracking during the farrowing process and on the occasion of farrowing issues. Furthermore, PigSense also predicts the daily pattern and weight gain in the lactation cycle with 89% accuracy, a metric that can be used to monitor the piglets’ growth progress over the lactation cycle.",

Advances in radar systems have enabled non-contact detection of human vital signs, emerging as a crucial area of research. The movements of key human organs influence radar signal propagation, offering researchers the opportunity to detect vital signs by analyzing received electromagnetic (EM) signals. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing for vital sign detection. We explore human anatomy and various measurement methods, including contact and non-contact approaches, and summarize the principles of mmWave radar sensing. To demonstrate how EM signals can be harnessed for vital sign detection, we discuss four mmWave-based vital sign sensing (MVSS) signal models and elaborate on the signal processing chain for MVSS. Additionally, we present an extensive review of deep learning-based MVSS and compare existing studies. Finally, we offer insights into specific applications of MVSS (e.g., biometric authentication) and highlight future research trends in this domain.",

From soil features to crop health and climatic observations, the smart sensors integrate with sophisticated technologies such as the Internet of Things or cloud for decentralized processing and global actuation. Considering this integration, an Amendable Multi-Function Sensor Control (AMFSC) is introduced in this proposal. This proposed method focuses on sensor operations that aid agricultural production improvements. The agriculture hindering features from the soil, temperature, and crop infections are sensed and response is actuated based on controlled operations. The control operations are performed according to the sensor control validation and modified control acute sensor, which helps to maximize productivity. The sensor control and operations are determined using federated learning from the accumulated data in the previous sensing intervals. This learning validates the current sensor data with the optimal data stored for different crops and environmental factors in the past. Depending on the computed, sensed, and optimal (adaptable) data, the sensor operation for actuation is modified. This modification is recommended for crop and agriculture development to maximize agricultural productivity. In particular, the sensing and actuation operations of the smart sensors for different intervals are modified to maximize production and adaptability. The efficiency of the system was evaluated using different parameters and the system maximizes the analysis rate (12.52%), control rate (7%), adaptability (9.65%) and minimizes the analysis time (7.12%), and actuation lag (8.97%)",

However, the cyber security breach classification is still a difficult problem, even using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. In this article, we study a multi-class classification problem in cyber security for attack detection. A challenging multi-node data-censoring case is considered. In such a case, data within each data center/node cannot be shared while the local data is incomplete. Particularly, local nodes contain only a part of the multiple classes. In order to train a global multi-class classifier without sharing the raw data across all nodes, we design a multi-node multi-class classification ensemble approach which is the main result of our study. By gathering the estimated parameters of the binary classifiers and data densities from each local node, the missing information for each local node is completed to build the global multi-class classifier. Numerical experiments are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under the multi-node data-censoring case. Under such a case, we even show the out-performance of the proposed approach over the full-data approach.",

The VSSB-Raft consensus algorithm realizes zero trust through the supervisor node and secret sharing algorithm without the invisible trust between nodes required by the algorithm. Meanwhile, the VSSB-Raft consensus algorithm uses the SM2 signature algorithm to realize the characteristics of zero trust requiring authentication before data use. In addition, by introducing the NDN network, we redesign the communication between nodes and guarantee the communication quality among nodes. The VSSB-Raft consensus algorithm proposed in this paper can make the algorithm Byzantine fault tolerant by setting a threshold for secret sharing while maintaining the algorithm’s complexity to be O(n).

    "abstract": "Advanced mobile communication and data processing technologies have promoted the development of Internet of Things (IoT), but they have also posed challenges to the distributed federated learning mode in the field of Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Faced with a large number of vehicle nodes available for federated training in IoV, the federated learning training task becomes challenging when motivating a large number of vehicles participant. A difficulty posed for federated learning in IoV is heterogeneity challenges caused by massive device participation. Moreover, excessive resource and system maintenance costs associated with a large number of poor-quality devices participating in federated training cannot be ignored. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel vehicle device selection and aggregation joint optimization model based on a many-objective evolutionary algorithm. The proposed model can be optimized by BiGE algorithm to obtain an optimal subset of vehicle equipment and corresponding weight assignment scheme, thus reducing unnecessary resources waste and budget expenditure while ensuring global model performance. To verify the feasibility of the model, several sets of experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our proposed model has acceptable performance while largely reducing the number budget of participants.",

Efforts have mainly centered on improving HVAC systems, the central control system. However, it’s evident that HVAC alone can’t ensure occupant comfort. Lighting, blinds, and windows, often overlooked, also impact energy use and comfort. This paper introduces a holistic approach to managing the delicate balance between energy efficiency and occupant comfort in commercial buildings. We present OCTOPUS , a system employing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework using data-driven techniques to optimize control sequences for all building subsystems, including HVAC, lighting, blinds, and windows. OCTOPUS ’s DRL architecture features a unique reward function facilitating the exploration of tradeoffs between energy usage and user comfort, effectively addressing the high-dimensional control problem resulting from interactions among these four building subsystems. To meet data training requirements, we emphasize the importance of calibrated simulations that closely replicate target-building operational conditions. We train OCTOPUS using 10-year weather data and a calibrated building model in the EnergyPlus simulator. Extensive simulations demonstrate that OCTOPUS achieves substantial energy savings, outperforming state-of-the-art rule-based and DRL-based methods by 14.26% and 8.1%, respectively, in a LEED Gold Certified building while maintaining desired human comfort levels.",

We therefore introduce GreenTag, a low-cost RFID-based soil moisture sensing system whose accuracy is comparable to that of an expensive soil moisture sensor. Our key idea is to attach two RFID tags to a plant’s container so that changes in soil moisture content are reflected in their Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) metric at the reader. We show that a low-pass filtered DMRT metric is robust to changes both in the RF environment (e.g., from human movement) and in pot locations. In addition, we propose a fast DMRT acquisition algorithm and a time-efficient tag query protocol, which can reduce the sensing latency by 90%. In a realistic setting, GreenTag achieves a 90-percentile moisture estimation errors of 5%, which is comparable to the 4% errors using expensive soil moisture sensors.

The distinct and reproducible patterns of eye movements among individuals present an opportunity for user identification, known as eye authentication. However, current eye authentication solutions face limitations due to the low temporal resolution of CMOS/CCD cameras, leading to accuracy issues in robust authentication. Moreover, CMOS cameras capturing detailed appearance around the eye region raise concerns about privacy leakage. To overcome these challenges, we propose leveraging event cameras for eye authentication. Event cameras encode per-pixel intensity changes as an asynchronous event stream with high temporal resolution (tens of microseconds), capable of capturing subtle identity-related characteristics from eye movements, termed micro-motion. This paper introduces EV-GazeLock, a novel authentication approach based on eye movements captured by event cameras. EV-GazeLock uses only event streams as input and extracts identity-related characteristics through a custom MicroFlow network designed for spatial-temporal feature extraction from micro-motion. This effectively distinguishes eye movements between different users while avoiding recording detailed eye appearance. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that EV-GazeLock significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art gaze authentication or recognition methods. Ablation studies further validate the design efficacy of MicroFlow, reinforcing the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Specifically, under the assumptions that nodes are deployed as a Poisson point process with density λ in a square region with side length ℓ and each sensor can cover a unit-area disk, we first derive the necessary and sufficient condition of the node density in order to maintain complete k -coverage with probability approaching 1. With this result, we obtain that if λ = log ℓ 2 + ( k + 2)loglog ℓ 2 + c (ℓ), c (ℓ) → −∞, as ℓ → + ∞, the sensor network lifetime (for maintaining complete coverage) is upper bounded by kT with probability approaching 1 as ℓ → + ∞, where T is the lifetime of a single sensor. Second, we derive, given a fixed node density in a finite (but reasonably large) region, the upper bounds of lifetime when only α-portion of the region is covered at any time. We also carry out several sets of experiments to validate the derived theoretical results. Numerical results indicate that the derived upper bounds apply not only to networks of large sizes and homogeneous nodal distributions but also to small size networks with clustering nodal distributions.",

    "abstract": "Sensor networks are often deployed in unattended environments, thus leaving these networks vulnerable to false data injection attacks in which an adversary injects false data into the network with the goal of deceiving the base station or depleting the resources of the relaying nodes. Standard authentication mechanisms cannot prevent this attack if the adversary has compromised one or a small number of sensor nodes. We present three interleaved hop-by-hop authentication schemes that guarantee that the base station can detect injected false data immediately when no more than t nodes are compromised, where t is a system design parameter. Moreover, these schemes enable an intermediate forwarding node to detect and discard false data packets as early as possible. Our performance analysis shows that our scheme is efficient with respect to the security it provides, and it also allows a tradeoff between security and performance. A prototype implementation of our scheme indicates that our scheme is practical and can be deployed on the current generation of sensor nodes.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by recently surfacing viruses that can spread over the air interfaces, in this article, we investigate the potentially disastrous threat of node compromise spreading in wireless sensor networks. We assume such a compromise originating from a single infected node, can propagate to other sensor nodes via communication and pre-established mutual trust. We focus on the possible epidemic breakout of such propagations where the whole network may fall victim to the attack. Using epidemic theory, we model and analyze this spreading process and identify key factors determining potential outbreaks. In particular, we perform our study on random graphs precisely constructed according to the parameters of the network, such as distance, key sharing constrained communication and node recovery, thereby reflecting the true characteristics therein. Moreover, a comparative study of the epidemic propagation is performed based on the effects of two types of sensor deployment strategies, viz., uniform random and group-based deployment. The analytical results provide deep insights in designing potential defense strategies against this threat. Furthermore, through extensive simulations, we validate the model and perform investigations on the system dynamics. Our analysis and simulation results indicate that the uniform random deployment is more vulnerable to an epidemic outbreak than the group based deployment strategy.",

In this article, we define different types of anomalies that occur in wireless sensor networks and provide formal models for them. We illustrate the model using statistical parameters on a dataset gathered from a real wireless sensor network deployment at the Intel Berkeley Research Laboratory. Our experiments with a novel distributed anomaly detection algorithm show that it can detect elliptical anomalies with exactly the same accuracy as that of a centralized scheme, while achieving a significant reduction in energy consumption in the network.

    "abstract": "Most sensor network research and software design has been guided by an architectural principle that permits multinode data fusion on small-form-factor, resource-poor nodes, or motes . While we were among the earliest promoters of this approach, through experience we found that this principle leads to fragile and unmanageable systems and explore an alternative. The Tenet architecture is motivated by the observation that future large-scale sensor network deployments will be tiered , consisting of motes in the lower tier and masters , relatively unconstrained 32-bit platform nodes, in the upper tier. Tenet constrains multinode fusion to the master tier while allowing motes to process locally-generated sensor data. This simplifies application development and allows mote-tier software to be reused. Applications running on masters task motes by composing task descriptions from a novel tasklet library. Our Tenet implementation also contains a robust and scalable networking subsystem for disseminating tasks and reliably delivering responses. We show that a Tenet pursuit-evasion application exhibits performance comparable to a mote-native implementation while being considerably more compact. We also present two real-world deployments of Tenet system: a structural vibration monitoring application at Vincent Thomas Bridge and an imaging-based habitat monitoring application at James Reserve, and show that tiered architecture scales network capacity and allows reliable delivery of high rate data. 1",

Due to high rates of unexpected node/link failures, robust data delivery through multiple hops also becomes a critical issue. In this article we present a state-free gradient-based forwarding (SGF) protocol to address these challenges. Nodes running SGF do not maintain states of neighbors or network topology and thus can scale to very large networks. Without using routing tables, SGF builds a cost field called gradient that provides each node the direction to forward data. The maintenance of gradient is purely driven by data transmissions and hence incurs little overhead. To adapt to transient channel variations and topology changes, the forwarder of a routing node is selected opportunistically among multiple candidate nodes through a distributed contention process. Simulation results show that SGF achieves significant energy savings and outperforms several existing data forwarding protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay.",

The use of mobility significantly reduces the energy consumption at sensor nodes, elongating the functional lifetime of the network. However, a drawback is an increased data delivery latency. Reducing the latency through optimizing the motion of data mules is critical for this approach to thrive. In this article, we focus on the problem of motion planning, specifically, determination of the speed of the data mule and the scheduling of the communication tasks with the sensors. We consider three models of mobility capability of the data mule to accommodate different types of vehicles. Under each mobility model, we design optimal and heuristic algorithms for different problems: single data mule case, single data mule with periodic data generation case, and multiple data mules case. We compare the performance of the heuristic algorithm with a naive algorithm and also with the multihop forwarding approach by numerical experiments. We also compare one of the optimal algorithms with a previously proposed method to see how our algorithm improves the performance and is also useful in practice. As far as we know, this study is the first of a kind that provides a systematic understanding of the motion planning problem of data mules.",

Specifically, we show that in a network of n sensors arbitrarily distributed in the plane, a sample of O (1/ϵ log 1/ϵ) sensor nodes ( mice ) is sufficient to catch any, and only those , events that affect Ω (ϵ n ) nodes ( elephants ), for any 0 &lt; ϵ &lt; 1, as long as the geometry of the event has a bounded Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. In fact, the scheme is provably able to estimate the size of an event within the approximation error of ±ϵ n /4, which can be improved further at the expense of more mice. The detection algorithm itself requires knowledge of the event geometry (e.g., circle, ellipse, or rectangle) for the sake of computational efficiency, but the combinatorial bound on the sample size (set of mice) depends only on the VC, dimension of the event class and not the precise shape geometry. While nearly optimal in theory, due to implicit constant factors, these “scale-free” bounds still prove too large in practice if applied blindly. We therefore propose heuristic improvements and perform empirical parameter tuning to counter the pessimism inherent in these theoretical estimates. Using a variety of data distributions and event geometries, we show through simulations that the final scheme is eminently scalable and practical, say, for n ≥ 1000. The overall simplicity and generality of our technique suggests that it is well suited for a wide class of sensornet applications, including monitoring of physical environments, network anomalies, network security, or any abstract binary event that affects a significant number of nodes in the network.",

The deployment region is divided into square regions. The predistribution scheme has the advantage that all nodes within a particular region can communicate with each other directly and nodes which lie in a different regions can communicate via special nodes called agents which have more resources than the general nodes. The number of agents in a region is always three, whatever the size of the network. We give measures of resiliency taking the Lee distance into account. Apart from considering the resiliency in terms of fraction of links broken, we also consider the resiliency as the number of nodes and regions disconnected when some sensor are compromised. This second measure, though very important, had not been studied so far in key predistribution schemes which use deployment knowledge. We find that the resiliency as the fraction of links compromised is better than existing schemes. The number of keys preloaded in each sensor node is much less than all existing schemes and nodes are either directly connected or connected via two hop paths. The deterministic key predistribution schemes result in constant-time computation overhead for shared key discovery and path key establishment.",

The transport of event impulses is likely to lead to varying degrees of congestion in the network depending on the distribution and rate of packet sources in the network. It is during these periods of event impulses that the likelihood of congestion is greatest and the information in transit of most importance to users. To address this challenge we propose an energy-efficient congestion control scheme for sensor networks called CODA (COngestion Detection and Avoidance) that comprises three mechanisms: (i) receiver-based congestion detection; (ii) open-loop hop-by-hop backpressure; and (iii) closed-loop multisource regulation. We present the detailed design, implementation, and evaluation of CODA using simulation and experimentation. We define three important performance metrics (i.e., energy tax, fidelity penalty, and power) to evaluate the impact of CODA on the performance of sensing applications. We discuss the performance benefits and practical engineering challenges of implementing CODA in an experimental sensor network testbed based on Berkeley motes using CSMA. Simulation results indicate that CODA significantly improves the performance of data dissemination applications such as directed diffusion by mitigating hotspots, and reducing the energy tax and fidelity penalty on sensing applications. We also demonstrate that CODA is capable of responding to a number of congestion scenarios that we believe will be prevalent as the deployment of these networks accelerates.",

We model the movement of a target based on the Gauss Markov Mobility Model [Camp et al. 2002]. On detecting a target, the cluster head which detects it activates an optimal number of nodes within its cluster, so that these nodes start sensing the target. A Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based framework is designed to adaptively determine the optimal policy for selecting the nodes localized with each cluster. As the distance between the node and the target decreases, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) increases, thereby increasing the precision of the readings of sensing the target at each node.

In this work, we investigate the impact of the clocking subsystem on the time synchronization service and address, in particular, the influence of changes in environmental temperature on clock drift in highly duty-cycled wireless sensor nodes. We also develop formulas that help the system architect choose the optimal resynchronization period to achieve a given synchronization accuracy.

This motivates a clustered sensor placement scheme, where locations are classified into clusters based on the ordering of the mean, with the number of sensors placed in each cluster determined by the ordering of the variances. We show that under idealized conditions the greedy mutual information maximization algorithm applied globally is equivalent to that applied cluster by cluster, but the latter has the advantage of being more scalable.

Not only should the sensors be informative, but they should also be able to communicate efficiently. In this article, we present a data-driven approach that addresses the three central aspects of this problem: measuring the predictive quality of a set of sensor locations (regardless of whether sensors were ever placed at these locations), predicting the communication cost involved with these placements, and designing an algorithm with provable quality guarantees that optimizes the NP-hard trade-off. Specifically, we use data from a pilot deployment to build nonparametric probabilistic models called Gaussian Processes (GPs) both for the spatial phenomena of interest and for the spatial variability of link qualities, which allows us to estimate predictive power and communication cost of unsensed locations. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the representation of link qualities plays an important role in estimating communication costs. Using these models, we present a novel, polynomial-time, data-driven algorithm, PSPIEL, which selects Sensor Placements at Informative and communication-Efficient Locations. Our approach exploits two important properties of this problem: submodularity , formalizing the intuition that adding a node to a small deployment can help more than adding a node to a large deployment; and locality , under which nodes that are far from each other provide almost independent information. Exploiting these properties, we prove strong approximation guarantees for our PSPIEL approach. In addition, we show how our placements can be made robust against changes in the environment, and how PSPIEL can be used to plan informative paths for information gathering using mobile robots. We also provide extensive experimental validation of this practical approach on several real-world placement problems, and built a complete system implementation on 46 Tmote Sky motes, demonstrating significant advantages over existing methods.",

To match performance requirements, specialised schedule based medium access control (MAC) protocols are employed. In order to construct an efficient system, it is necessary to find a schedule that can support the given application requirements in terms of data delivery latency and reliability. Furthermore, additional requirements such as transmission power may have to be taken into account when constructing the schedule. In this article, we show how such schedule can be constructed. We describe methods and tools to collect the data necessary as input for schedule calculation. Moreover, due to the high complexity of schedule calculation, we also introduce a heuristic. We evaluate the proposed methods in a real-world process automation and control application deployed in an oil refinery and further present a long-term experiment in an office environment. Additionally, we discuss a framework for schedule life-cycle management.",

However, errors are inevitable in distance measurements and we observe that a small number of outliers can degrade localization accuracy drastically. To deal with noisy and outlier ranging results, triangle inequality, is often employed in existing approaches. Our study shows that triangle inequality has many limitations, which make it far from accurate and reliable. In this study, we formally define the outlier detection problem for network localization and build a theoretical foundation to identify outliers based on graph embeddability and rigidity theory. Our analysis shows that the redundancy of distance measurements plays an important role. We then design a bilateration generic cycles-based outlier detection algorithm, and examine its effectiveness and efficiency through a network prototype implementation of MicaZ motes as well as extensive simulations.

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology has recently moved out of controlled laboratory settings to real-world deployments. Many of these deployments experience high rates of failure. Common types of failure include node failure, link failure, and node reboot. Due to the resource constraints of sensor nodes, existing techniques for fault detection in enterprise networks are not applicable. Previously proposed WSN fault detection algorithms either rely on periodic transmission of node status data or inferring node status based on passive information collection. The former approach significantly reduces network lifetime, while the latter achieves poor accuracy in dynamic or large networks. Herein, we propose Sequence-Based Fault Detection (SBFD), a novel framework for network fault detection in WSNs. The framework exploits in-network packet tagging using the Fletcher checksum and server-side network path analysis to efficiently deduce the path of all packets sent to the sink. The sink monitors the extracted packet paths to detect persistent path changes which are indicative of network failures. When a failure is suspected, the sink uses control messages to check the status of the affected nodes. SBFD was implemented in TinyOS on TelosB motes and its performance was assessed in a testbed network and in TOSSIM simulation. The method was found to achieve a fault detection accuracy of 90.7% to 95.0% for networks of 25 to 400 nodes at the cost of 0.164% to 0.239% additional control packets and a 0.5% reduction in node lifetime due to in-network packet tagging. Finally, a comparative study was conducted with existing solutions.",

    "abstract": "Wireless reprogramming of sensor nodes is a critical requirement in long-lived wireless sensor networks (WSNs) addressing several concerns, such as fixing bugs, upgrading the operating system and applications, and adapting applications behavior according to the physical environment. In such resource-poor platforms, the ability to efficiently delimit and reconfigure the necessary portion of sensor software—instead of updating the full binary image—is of vital importance. However, most existing approaches in this field have not been adopted widely to date due to the extensive use of WSN resources or lack of generality. In this article, we therefore consider WSN programming models and runtime reconfiguration models as two interrelated factors and we present an integrated approach for addressing efficient reprogramming in WSNs. The middleware solution we propose, &lt;scp&lt;RemoWare&lt;/scp&lt;, is characterized by mitigating the cost of post-deployment software updates on sensor nodes via the notion of in situ reconfigurability and providing a component-based programming abstraction in order to facilitate the development of dynamic WSN applications.

    "abstract": "Most applications of wireless sensor networks require reliable and timely data communication with maximum possible network lifetime under low traffic regime. These requirements are very critical especially for the stability of wireless sensor and actuator networks. Designing a protocol that satisfies these requirements in a network consisting of sensor nodes with traffic pattern and location varying over time and space is a challenging task. We propose an adaptive optimal duty-cycle algorithm running on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control to minimize power consumption while meeting the reliability and delay requirements. Such a problem is complicated because simple and accurate models of the effects of the duty cycle on reliability, delay, and power consumption are not available. Moreover, the scarce computational resources of the devices and the lack of prior information about the topology make it impossible to compute the optimal parameters of the protocols. Based on an experimental implementation, we propose simple experimental models to expose the dependency of reliability, delay, and power consumption on the duty cycle at the node and validate it through extensive experiments. The coefficients of the experimental-based models can be easily computed on existing IEEE 802.15.4 hardware platforms by introducing a learning phase without any explicit information about data traffic, network topology, and medium access control parameters. The experimental-based model is then used to derive a distributed adaptive algorithm for minimizing the power consumption while meeting the reliability and delay requirements in the packet transmission. The algorithm is easily implementable on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control without any modifications of the protocol. An experimental implementation of the distributed adaptive algorithm on a test bed with off-the-shelf wireless sensor devices is presented. The experimental performance of the algorithms is compared to the existing solutions from the literature. The experimental results show that the experimental-based model is accurate and that the proposed adaptive algorithm attains the optimal value of the duty cycle, maximizing the lifetime of the network while meeting the reliability and delay constraints under both stationary and transient conditions. Specifically, even if the number of devices and their traffic configuration change sharply, the proposed adaptive algorithm allows the network to operate close to its optimal value. Furthermore, for Poisson arrivals, the duty-cycle protocol is modeled as a finite capacity queuing system in a star network. This simple analytical model provides insights into the performance metrics, including the reliability, average delay, and average power consumption of the duty-cycle protocol.",

    "abstract": "The wireless rechargeable sensor network is a promising platform for long-term applications such as inventory management, supply chain monitoring, and so on. For these applications, sensor localization is one of the most fundamental challenges. Different from a traditional sensor node, a wireless rechargeable sensor has to be charged above a voltage level by the wireless charger in order to support its sensing, computation, and communication operations. In this work, we consider the scenario where a mobile charger stops at different positions to charge sensors and propose a novel localization design that utilizes the unique Time of Charge (TOC) sequences among wireless rechargeable sensors. Specifically, we introduce two efficient region dividing methods, Internode Division and Interarea Division , to exploit TOC differences from both temporal and spatial dimensions to localize individual sensor nodes. To further optimize the system performance, we introduce both an optimal charger stop planning algorithm for the single-sensor case and a suboptimal charger stop planning algorithm for the generic multisensor scenario with a provable performance bound. We have extensively evaluated our design by both testbed experiments and large-scale simulations. The experiment and simulation results show that by as less as five stops, our design can achieve sub-meter accuracy and the performance is robust under various system conditions.",

In this article, we present the design and implementation of Memento, an emotion-driven lifelogging system on wearables. Memento integrates EEG sensors with smart glasses.

Previous approaches on image-based localization, due to their computation and storage requirements, often process queries at servers. This does not scale well, incurs round-trip delay, and requires constant network connectivity. Many also require users to manually confirm the shortlisted matched landmarks, which is inconvenient, slow, and prone to selection error. To overcome these limitations, we propose a h ighly a utomated (in terms of image confirmation after taking images) i mage-based l ocalization algorithm (HAIL), distributed in mobile devices. HAIL achieves resource efficiency (in terms of storage and processing) by keeping only distinguishing visual features for each landmark, and employing the efficient k-d tree to search for features. It further utilizes motion sensors and map constraints to enhance the localization accuracy without user operation. We have implemented HAIL on Android platforms and conducted extensive experiments in a food plaza and a premium shopping mall. Experimental results show that it achieves much higher localization accuracy (reducing the localization error by more than 20%) and computation efficiency (by more than 40% in time) as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

We use deployment data to continually adapt sensing to changing environmental patterns and transfer learning to reduce the training time in real deployments. In our 60 node deployment lasting two weeks, we observe a dead time of 0.1%.

    "abstract": "Concurrent transmission (CT) has been widely adopted to optimize the throughput of various data transmissions in wireless networks, such as bulk data dissemination and high-rate data collection. In CT, besides the possible data frame collision at receivers, we observe that acknowledgment frame (ACK) collision at senders can also significantly diminish concurrency opportunities. In this article, to avoid the potential ACK collision in CT, we propose ALIGNER which develops a new transmission pattern to coordinate concurrent senders in a distributed manner. The key idea is to align the silent periods of concurrent transmitters. To achieve this goal, we align the end of data frames concurrently transmitted by several senders. Therefore, the potentially arriving ACKs can avoid a collision with ongoing data transmissions because the concurrent senders are in a listening state to wait for receivers’ ACKs for a short and fixed period. ALIGNER can be applied for both deterministic and opportunistic forwarding protocols. It optionally uses a random back-off and slotted ACK mechanism to avoid a potential collision among simultaneously arrived ACKs in opportunistic forwarding. In addition, ALIGNER adopts a tailor-made metrics to analyze the throughput benefit of concurrent transmission for both deterministic and opportunistic data collection protocols. We have implemented ALIGNER in TinyOS and conducted extensive experiments on a real testbed. Experimental results show that ALIGNER can significantly increase the concurrency opportunities in both deterministic (up to 105%) and opportunistic (up to 89.7%) forwarding compared with the state-of-the-art CT methods.",

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing and network function virtualization (NFV) paradigms enable new flexibility and possibilities of the deployment of extreme low-latency services for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications within the proximity of their users. However, this poses great challenges to find optimal placements of virtualized network functions (VNFs) for data processing requests of IoT applications in a multi-tier cloud network, which consists of many small- or medium-scale servers, clusters, or cloudlets deployed within the proximity of IoT nodes and a few large-scale remote data centers with abundant computing and storage resources. In particular, it is challenging to jointly consider VNF instance placement and routing traffic path planning for user requests, as they are not only delay sensitive but also resource hungry. In this article, we consider admissions of NFV-enabled requests of IoT applications in a multi-tier cloud network, where users request network services by issuing service requests with service chain requirements, and the service chain enforces the data traffic of the request to pass through the VNFs in the chain one by one until it reaches its destination. To this end, we first formulate the throughput maximization problem with the aim to maximize the system throughput. We then propose an integer linear program solution if the problem size is small; otherwise, we devise an efficient heuristic that jointly takes into account VNF placements to both cloudlets and data centers and routing path finding for each request. For a special case of the problem with a set of service chains, we propose an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio. Next, we also devise efficient learning-based heuristics for VNF provisioning for IoT applications by incorporating the mobility and energy conservation features of IoT devices. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by simulations. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms is promising.",

Then a set of denoising convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are trained with the contaminated PPG signals and their corresponding clean PPG signals. Contaminated PPG signals are then denoised by an ensemble of DCNNs and a spectrum-analysis-based calibration is performed to estimate the final HR. We evaluate DeepHeart on the IEEE Signal Processing Cup training data set with 12 records collected during various physical activities.

However, existing localization approaches based on received signal strength indicators are either easily affected by signal fading of different land-cover types or labor intensive. In this work, we propose SateLoc, a LoRa localization system that utilizes satellite images to generate virtual fingerprints. Specifically, SateLoc first uses high-resolution satellite images to identify land-cover types. With the path loss parameters of each land-cover type, SateLoc can automatically generate a virtual fingerprinting map for each gateway. We then propose a novel multi-gateway combination strategy, which is weighted by the environmental interference of each gateway, to produce a joint likelihood distribution for localization and tracking. We implement SateLoc with commercial LoRa devices without any hardware modification, and evaluate its performance in a 227,500-m <?TeX $^2$?> urban area. Experimental results show that SateLoc achieves a median localization error of 43.5 m, improving more than 50% compared to state-of-the-art model-based approaches. Moreover, SateLoc can achieve a median tracking error of 37.9 m with the distance constraint of adjacent estimated locations.

We evaluate the authentication performance of DeFFusion in terms of impact of training data size and time window size, accuracy comparison on different features over different classifiers and on different classifiers with the same CNN-extracted features, accuracy on unseen users, time efficiency, and comparison with representative authentication methods. The experimental results demonstrate that DeFFusion has the best accuracy by achieving the mean equal error rate of 1.00% in a 5-second time window size.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, intensive research has been conducted to enable people to live more comfortably. Developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) , big data, and artificial intelligence have taken this type of research to a new level and led to the emergence of the Internet of Behaviors (IoB) , which analyzes behavioral patterns. However, current IoB technologies are not capable of handling heterogeneous data. While it is quite common to have different formats of sensor data for the same behavioral observation, the use of these different data formats can significantly help to obtain a more accurate classification of the observation. Another limitation is that existing IoB deep learning models rely on inefficient hyperparameter tuning strategies. In this paper, we present an Advanced Deep Learning framework for IoB (ADLIoB) applied to connected vehicles. Several deep learning architectures are employed in this framework: CNN, Graph CNN (GCNN), and LSTM are used to train sensor data of different formats. In addition, a branch-and-bound technique is used to intelligently select hyperparameters. To validate ADLIoB, experiments were conducted on four databases for connected vehicles. The results clearly show that ADLIoB is superior to the baseline solutions in terms of both accuracy and runtime.",

Existing works with multiple mobile chargers (MCs) overlooked the benefits of partial charging and distributed control in large-scale wireless rechargeable sensor networks. In addition, most of them have not considered the complete heterogeneity of SNs’ energy profiles and idleness of the MCs. In this article, we address the aforesaid issues and present a game theory based distributed mobile charging protocol, called DMCP. We formulate the mobile charging problem as a series of repeated games played among the MCs and represent a game as a 0-1 integer linear programming to maximize the total profit of the MCs. In each game, DMCP dynamically determines the factor of charging of the energy-deficit SNs based on their relative criticality and selects the next-to-be-recharged SNs using an efficient bi-objective payoff function. In addition, it utilizes an innovative strategy and a self-enforcing agreement to promote cooperation among the MCs. Through extensive simulations and hypothesis testing, we show that DMCP reduces the charging delay up to 44.04% and enhances the charging coverage and survival rate up to 45.12% and 49.97%, respectively.",

However, recent studies and industrial deployment find that LoRa suffers severe signal attenuation because of signal blockage in smart cities and long communication ranges in smart agriculture applications. As a result, weak LoRa packets cannot be correctly demodulated or even be detected in practice. To address this problem, this paper presents the design and implementation of MALoRa: a new LoRa reception scheme which aims to improve LoRa reception performance with antenna diversities. At a high level, MALoRa improves signal strength by reliably detecting and coherently combining weak signals received by multiple antennas of a gateway. MALoRa addresses a series of practical challenges, including reliable packet detection, symbol edge extraction, and phase-aligned constructive combining of weak signals. Moreover, MALoRa can also be applied to mobile devices. Experiment results show that MALoRa can effectively expand communication range, increase battery life of LoRa devices, and improve packet detection and demodulation performance especially in ultra-low SNR scenarios.",

    "abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) , indoor wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been used to monitor Alzheimer's disease patients daily and guide their behaviors. Alzheimer's disease may seriously impact patients’ memory, and thoughts of “what should I do” can unexpectedly form in their mind. This cognitive impairment can affect patients’ independence and well-being. As a basic infrastructure for future healthcare systems, WSN can collect patient behaviors, such as their positions and states, to support safety and health analyses. Therefore, this paper proposes a probabilistic model checking-based method to predict patient behaviors and detect abnormal behaviors related to mild cognitive impairment to help patients rebuild their confidence and perception. First, the layout of the home environment is abstracted as a formal grid, and a user activity model (UAM) is proposed in the form of discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) to describe patients’ activity based on data collected by sensors. Second, because Alzheimer's patients with mild cognitive impairment (A-MCI) often forget their next daily activities, we classify and describe their daily behaviors as verification requirements in the form of probabilistic computational tree logic (PCTL) . Then, the UAM is input into a probabilistic model checking tool and compared against the verification property PCTL to calculate the probability values and assess temporal behaviors. As result, the activity with the largest probability is selected for behavior guidance. Third, we demonstrate the process of detecting abnormalities, including activities with abnormal temporal behaviors and activities with normal temporal behaviors but unexpected probabilities that may be repeated more than twice. The key states are extracted from the UAM to specify the verification properties for abnormality detection. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the usability and feasibility of our proposed method.",

Effective privacy preservation is foremost for various mobile applications. Recently, geo-indistinguishability and expected inference error are proposed for limiting location leakages. In this article, we argue that personalization means regionalization for geo-indistinguishability, and we propose a regionalized location obfuscation mechanism called DPIVE with personalized utility sensitivities. This substantially corrects the differential and distortion privacy problem of the PIVE framework proposed by Yu et al. on NDSS 2017. We develop DPIVE with two phases. In Phase I, we determine disjoint sets by partitioning all possible positions such that different locations in the same set share the Protection Location Set (PLS). In Phase II, we construct a probability distribution matrix in which the rows corresponding to the same PLS have their own sensitivity of utility (PLS diameter). Moreover, by designing a QK-means algorithm for more search space in 2-D space, we improve DPIVE with a refined location partition and present fine-grained personalization, enabling each location to have its own privacy level endowed with a customized privacy budget. Experiments with two public datasets demonstrate that our mechanisms have the superior performance, typically on skewed locations.",

While we find that NLOS links can vary significantly in the same environment, LOS links possess similar features that can be captured by the high bandwidth of UWB. Specifically, the high-level idea of RefLoc is to first identify links among anchors with known positions and leverage those links as references for tag link identification. To achieve this, we address the practical challenges of deriving anchor link status, extracting qualified link features, and inferring tag links with anchor links. We implement RefLoc on commercial hardware and conduct extensive experiments in different environments. The evaluation results show that RefLoc achieves an average NLOS identification accuracy of 96% in various environments, improving the state-of-the-art by 10%, and reduces 80% localization error with little overhead.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks hold a very promising future. The nodes of wireless sensor networks (WSN) have a small energy supply and limited bandwidth available. Since radio communication is expensive in terms of energy consumption, the nodes typically spend most of their energy reserve on wireless communication (rather than on CPU processing) for data dissemination and retrieval. Therefore, the role of energy conserving data communication protocols and services in WSN can not be overemphasized. Caching data at locations that minimize packet transmissions in the network reduces the power consumption in the network, and hence extends its lifetime. Finding locations of the nodes for caching data to minimize communication cost corresponds to finding the nodes of a weighted Minimum Steiner tree whose edge weights depend on the edge's Euclidean length and its data traffic rate. We call this tree a Steiner Data Caching Tree (SDCT). We prove that an optimal SDCT is binary, and that at-least two of the three internal angles formed at the Steiner points are equal. We derive expressions that determine the exact location of a Steiner point for a set of three nodes based on their location and their data refresh rate requirements. Based on these (optimality) results, we present a dynamic distributed energy-conserving application-layer service for data caching and asynchronous multicast. We present the results of simulation of our service that verifies its power saving properties.",

We assume that the nodes use either joint entropy coding based on explicit communication between sensor nodes, where coding is done when side information is available, or Slepian-Wolf coding where nodes have knowledge of network correlation statistics. We consider both maximum and average distortion bounds. We prove that this optimization is NP-complete since it involves an interplay between the spaces of possible transmission structures given radio reachability limitations, and feasible placements satisfying distortion bounds.We address this problem by first looking at the simplified problem of optimal placement in the one-dimensional case. An analytical solution is derived for the case when there is a simple aggregation scheme, and numerical results are provided for the cases when joint entropy encoding is used. We use the insight from our 1-D analysis to extend our results to the 2-D case and compare it to typical uniform random placement and shortest-path tree. Our algorithm for two-dimensional placement and transmission structure provides two to three fold reduction in total power consumption and between one to two orders of magnitude reduction in bottleneck power consumption. We perform an exhaustive performance analysis of our scheme under varying correlation models and model parameters and demonstrate that the performance improvement is typical over a range of data correlation models and parameters. We also study the impact of performing computationally-efficient data conditioning over a local scope rather than the entire network. Finally, we extend our explicit placement results to a randomized placement scheme and show that such a scheme can be effective when deployment does not permit exact node placement.",

The code image is also pipelined through the network at the granularity of pages. In this article we propose a protocol called Freshet for optimizing the energy for code upload and speeding up the dissemination if multiple sources of code are available. The energy optimization is achieved by equipping each node with limited nonlocal topology information which it uses to determine the time when it can go to sleep since code is not being distributed in its vicinity. The protocol to handle multiple sources provides a loose coupling of nodes to a source and disseminates code in waves each originating at a source with a mechanism to handle collisions when the waves meet. The protocol's performance with respect to reliability, delay, and energy consumed is demonstrated through analysis, simulation, and implementation on the Berkeley mote platform.",

    "abstract": "Radio interference, whether intentional or otherwise, represents a serious threat to assuring the availability of sensor network services. As such, techniques that enhance the reliability of sensor communications in the presence of radio interference are critical. In this article, we propose to cope with this threat through a technique called channel surfing, whereby the sensor nodes in the network adapt their channel assignments to restore network connectivity in the presence of interference. We explore two different approaches to channel surfing: coordinated channel switching, in which the entire sensor network adjusts its channel; and spectral multiplexing, in which nodes in a jammed region switch channels and nodes on the boundary of a jammed region act as radio relays between different spectral zones. For coordinated channel switching, we examine an autonomous strategy where each node detects the loss of its neighbors in order to initiate channel switching. To cope with latency issues in the autonomous strategy, we propose a broadcast-assisted channel switching strategy to more rapidly coordinate channel switching. For spectral multiplexing, we have devised both synchronous and asynchronous strategies to facilitate the scheduling of nodes in order to improve network fidelity when sensor nodes operate on multiple channels. In designing these algorithms, we have taken a system-oriented approach that has focused on exploring actual implementation issues under realistic network settings. We have implemented these proposed methods on a testbed of 30 Mica2 sensor nodes, and the experimental results show that channel surfing, in its various forms, is an effective technique for repairing network connectivity in the presence of radio interference, while not introducing significant performance-overhead.",

    "abstract": "There is a critical need for new thinking regarding overload traffic management in sensor networks. It has now become clear that experimental sensor networks (e.g., mote networks) and their applications commonly experience periods of persistent congestion and high packet loss, and in some cases even congestion collapse. This significantly impacts application fidelity measured at the physical sinks, even under light to moderate traffic loads, and is a direct product of the funneling effect ; that is, the many-to-one multihop traffic pattern that characterizes sensor network communications. Existing congestion control schemes are effective at mitigating congestion through rate control and packet drop mechanisms, but do so at the cost of significantly reducing application fidelity measured at the sinks. To address this problem we propose to exploit the availability of a small number of all wireless, multiradio virtual sinks that can be randomly distributed or selectively placed across the sensor field. Virtual sinks are capable of siphoning off data events from regions of the sensor field that are beginning to show signs of high traffic load. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Siphon , a set of fully distributed algorithms that support virtual sink discovery and selection, congestion detection, and traffic redirection in sensor networks. Siphon is based on a Stargate implementation of virtual sinks that uses a separate longer range radio network (based on IEEE 802.11) to siphon events to one or more physical sinks, and a short-range mote radio to interact with the sensor field at siphon points. Results from analysis, simulation and an experimental 48 Mica2 mote testbed show that virtual sinks can scale mote networks by effectively managing growing traffic demands while minimizing any negative impact on application fidelity. Additionally, we show the scheme is competitive with respect to energy consumption compared to a network composed of only motes.",

We prove that given a unit disk graph and the angles between adjacent edges, it is NP-hard to find a valid embedding in the plane such that neighboring nodes are within distance 1 from each other and non-neighboring nodes are at least distance √2/2 away. Despite the negative results, however, we can find a planar spanner of a unit disk graph by using only local angles. The planar spanner can be used to generate a set of virtual coordinates that enable efficient and local routing schemes such as geographical routing or approximate shortest path routing. We also proposed a practical anchor-free embedding scheme by solving a linear program. We show by simulation that it gives both a good local embedding, with neighboring nodes embedded close and non-neighboring nodes far away, and a satisfactory global view such that geographical routing and approximate shortest path routing on the embedded graph are almost identical to those on the original (true) embedding.",

In contrast to earlier research that treats different radio states (i.e., transmission/reception/idle) in isolation, MPC integrates them in a joint optimization problem that depends on both the set of active nodes and the transmission power. We propose four approximation algorithms with provable performance bounds and two practical routing protocols. Simulations based on realistic radio models show that the MPC approach can conserve more energy than existing minimum power routing and topology control protocols. Furthermore, it can flexibly adapt to network workload and radio platforms.",

This article addresses the problem of designing truly scalable protocols for computing aggregates in the presence of faults, protocols that can enable million node sensor networks to work efficiently. More precisely, we make four distinct contributions. First, we introduce a simple fault model and analyze the behavior of two existing protocols under the fault model: tree aggregation and gossip aggregation . Second, since the behavior of the two protocols depends on the size of the network and probability of failure, we introduce a hybrid approach that can leverage the strengths of the two protocols and minimize the weaknesses; the new protocol is analyzed under the same fault model. Third, we propose methodology for determining the optimal mix between the two basic protocols; the methodology consists in formulating an optimization problem, using models of the protocol behavior, and solving it. Fourth, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the hybrid protocol and show that it usually performs better, sometimes orders of magnitude better, than both the tree and gossip aggregation.",

The distinction between inner and boundary nodes of the network can provide valuable knowledge to a broad spectrum of algorithms. This article tackles the challenge of providing a scalable and range-free solution for boundary recognition that does not require a high node density. We explain the challenges of accurately defining the boundary of a wireless sensor network with and without node positions and provide a new definition of network boundary in the discrete domain. Our solution for boundary recognition approximates the boundary of the sensor network by determining the majority of inner nodes using geometric constructions, which guarantee that for a given d , a node lies inside of the construction for a d -quasi unit disk graph model of the wireless sensor network. Moreover, such geometric constructions make it possible to compute a guaranteed distance from a node to the boundary. We present a fully distributed algorithm for boundary recognition based on these concepts and perform a detailed complexity analysis. We provide a thorough evaluation of our approach and show that it is applicable to dense as well as sparse deployments.",

This article presents an approximation algorithm that can guarantee (1 − ε)-optimal network lifetime performance for base station placement problem with any desired error bound ε &gt; 0. The proposed (1 − ε)-optimal approximation algorithm is based on several novel techniques that makes it possible to reduce an infinite search space to a finite-element search space for base station location. The first technique used in this reduction is to discretize cost parameter (associated with energy consumption) with performance guarantee. Subsequently, the continuous search space can be broken up into a finite number of subareas. The second technique is to exploit the cost property of each subarea and represent it by a novel notion called fictitious cost point, each with guaranteed cost bounds. We give a proof that the proposed base station placement algorithm is (1− ε)-optimal. This approximation algorithm is simpler and faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm and represents the best known result to the base station placement problem.",

For the stochastic case, we evaluate the probability that the target is detected by at least k sensors and compute the free path until the target is first detected. For the deterministic case, we show an analogy between the target detection problem and the problem of minimizing the average symbol error probability in 2D digital modulation schemes. Motivated by this analogy, we propose a heuristic sensor placement algorithm, called DATE, that makes use of well-known signal constellations for determining good WSN constellations.

A-MAC's versatility stems from layering unicast, broadcast, wakeup, pollcast, and discovery above a single, flexible synchronization primitive. A-MAC's efficiency stems from optimizing this primitive and with it the most consequential decision that a low-power link makes: whether to stay awake or go to sleep after probing the channel. Today's receiver-initiated protocols require more time and energy to make this decision, and they exhibit worse judgment as well, leading to many false positives and negatives, and lower packet delivery ratios. A-MAC begins to make this decision quickly, and decides more conclusively and correctly in both the negative and affirmative. A-MAC's scalability comes from reserving one channel for the initial handshake and different channels for data transfer. Our results show that: (i) a unified implementation is possible; (ii) A-MAC's idle listening power increases by just 1.12× under interference, compared to 17.3× for LPL and 54.7× for RI-MAC; (iii) A-MAC offers high single-hop delivery ratios; (iv) network wakeup is faster and more channel efficient than LPL; and (v) collection routing performance exceeds the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Recently, distributed data storage has gained increasing popularity for efficient and robust data management in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The distributed architecture makes it challenging to build a highly secure and dependable yet lightweight data storage system. On the one hand, sensor data are subject to not only Byzantine failures, but also dynamic pollution attacks, as along the time the adversary may modify/pollute the stored data by compromising individual sensors. On the other hand, the resource-constrained nature of WSNs precludes the applicability of heavyweight security designs. To address the challenge, in this article we propose a novel dependable and secure data storage scheme with dynamic integrity assurance. Based on the principle of secret sharing and erasure coding, we first propose a hybrid share generation and distribution scheme to achieve reliable and fault-tolerant initial data storage by providing redundancy for original data components. To further dynamically ensure the integrity of the distributed data shares, we then propose an efficient data integrity verification scheme exploiting the techniques of algebraic signature and spot-checking. The proposed scheme enables individual sensors to verify in one protocol execution the correctness of all the pertaining data shares simultaneously in the absence of the original data. Extensive security analysis shows that the proposed scheme has strong resistance against various data pollution attacks. The efficiency of the scheme is demonstrated by experiments on sensor platforms Tmote Sky and iMote2.",

During reprogramming, the number of radio transmissions should be minimized, since reprogramming time and energy depend chiefly on the number of radio transmissions. In this article, we present a multihop incremental reprogramming protocol called Zephyr that transfers the delta between old and new software versions, and lets the sensor nodes rebuild the new software using the received delta and the old software. Zephyr reduces the delta size by using application-level modifications to mitigate the effects of function shifts. Then it compares the two binary images at the byte level to generate a small delta, that is then sent over the wireless network to all the nodes. For the wide range of software change cases that we used as benchmarks, Zephyr transfers 1.83 to 1987 times less traffic through the network than Deluge (the standard nonincremental reprogramming protocol for TinyOS) and 1.14 to 49 times less traffic than an existing incremental reprogramming protocol by Jeong and Culler [2004].",

In contrast to several recently proposed methods, DRGD does not require that the blind nodes be contained in the convex hull of the anchor nodes, and it can accurately localize the network with only a few anchors. Performance of DRGD is evaluated through extensive simulations and compared with three other algorithms, namely, the relaxation-based Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP), the Simulated Annealing (SA), and the Semi-Definite Programing (SDP). Similar to DRGD, SOCP and SA are distributed algorithms, whereas SDP is centralized. The results show that DRGD successfully localizes the nodes in all the cases, whereas in many cases SOCP and SA fail.

The target plant is described by a set of differential equations disturbed by a Brownian motion and randomly occurring nonlinearities (RONs) subject to time delays. The RONs are investigated here to reflect network-induced randomly occurring regulation of the delayed states on the current ones. Through available measurement output transmitted from the sensors, a distributed state estimator is designed to estimate the states of the target system, where each sensor can communicate with the neighboring sensors according to the given topology by means of a directed graph. The state estimation is carried out in a distributed way and is therefore applicable to online application. By resorting to the Lyapunov functional combined with stochastic analysis techniques, several delay-dependent criteria are established that not only ensure the estimation error to be globally asymptotically stable in the mean square, but also guarantee the existence of the desired estimator gains that can then be explicitly expressed when certain matrix inequalities are solved. A numerical example is given to verify the designed distributed state estimators.",

Unlike existing solutions that assume Gaussian process of target phenomena, this study measures the wind that inherently exhibits strong non-Gaussian yearly distribution. By leveraging the local monsoon characteristics of wind, we segment a year into different monsoon seasons that follow a unique distribution respectively. We also use computational fluid dynamics to learn the spatial correlation of wind. The output of sensor placement is a set of the most informative locations to deploy the wind sensors, based on the readings of which we can accurately predict the wind over the entire reservoir in real time. Ten wind sensors are deployed. The in-field measurement results of more than 3 months suggest that the proposed sensor placement and spatial prediction scheme provides accurate wind measurement that outperforms the state-of-the-art Gaussian model based on interpolation-based approaches.",

However, traditional volcanic instrumentation such as broadband seismometers are expensive, power hungry, bulky, and difficult to install. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) offer the potential to monitor volcanoes on unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. However, current volcanic WSN systems often yield poor monitoring quality due to the limited sensing capability of low-cost sensors and unpredictable dynamics of volcanic activities. In this article, we propose a novel quality-driven approach to achieving real-time, distributed, and long-lived volcanic earthquake detection and timing. By employing novel in-network collaborative signal processing algorithms, our approach can meet stringent requirements on sensing quality (i.e., low false alarm/missing rate, short detection delay, and precise earthquake onset time) at low power consumption. We have implemented our algorithms in TinyOS and conducted extensive evaluation on a testbed of 24 TelosB motes as well as simulations based on real data traces collected during 5.5 months on an active volcano.

However, traditional coverage model does not consider this intrinsic property of camera sensors. To address this issue, a novel model called full-view coverage is proposed. It uses the angle between the object's facing direction and the camera's viewing direction to measure the quality of coverage. An object is full-view covered if there is always a camera to cover it no matter which direction it faces and the camera's viewing direction is sufficiently close to the object's facing direction. An efficient method is proposed for full-view coverage detection in any given camera sensor networks, and a sufficient condition on the sensor density needed for full-view coverage in a random uniform deployment is derived. In addition, the article shows a necessary and sufficient condition on the sensor density for full-view coverage in a triangular lattice-based deployment. Based on the full-view coverage model, the article further studies the barrier coverage problem. Existing weak and strong barrier coverage models are extended by considering direction issues in camera sensor networks.

To exploit the strengths of both the physical and the protocol interference models, we analyze how network traffic, link length, and wireless signal attenuation affect the optimal instantiation of the protocol model. We also identify the inherent trade-off between reliability and throughput in the model instantiation. Our analysis sheds light on the open problem of efficiently optimizing the protocol model instantiation. Based on the analytical results, we propose the physical-ratio-K (PRK) interference model as a reliability-oriented instantiation of the protocol model. Via analysis, simulation, and testbed-based measurement, we show that PRK-based scheduling achieves a network throughput very close to (e.g., 95%) what is enabled by physical-model-based scheduling while ensuring the required packet delivery reliability. The PRK model inherits both the high fidelity of the physical model and the locality of the protocol model, thus it is expected to be suitable for distributed protocol design. These findings shed new light on wireless interference models; they also suggest new approaches to MAC protocol design in the presence of uncertainties in network and environmental conditions as well as application QoS requirements.",

Existing solutions usually use unicast instead of broadcast to forward packets from a node to its neighbors according to their working schedules, which is, however, not energy efficient. In this article, we propose to exploit the broadcast nature of wireless media to further save energy for low-duty-cycle networks, by adopting a novel broadcasting communication model. The key idea is to let some early wake-up nodes postpone their wake-up slots to overhear broadcasting messages from its neighbors. This model utilizes the spatiotemporal locality of broadcast to reduce the total energy consumption, which can be essentially characterized by the total number of broadcasting message transmissions. Based on such model, we aim at minimizing the total number of broadcasting message transmissions of a broadcast for low-duty-cycle WSNs, subject to the constraint that the broadcasting latency is optimal. We prove that it is NP-hard to find the optimal solution, and design an approximation algorithm that can achieve a polylogarithmic approximation ratio.

    "abstract": "Indoor emergency response situations, such as urban fire, are characterized by dangerous constantly changing operating environments with little access to situational information for first responders. In situ information about the conditions, such as the extent and evolution of an indoor fire, can augment rescue efforts and reduce risk to emergency personnel. Static sensor networks that are pre-deployed or manually deployed have been proposed but are less practical due to need for large infrastructure, lack of adaptivity, and limited coverage. Controlled-mobility in sensor networks, that is, the capability of nodes to move as per network needs can provide the desired autonomy to overcome these limitations. In this article, we present SensorFly, a controlled-mobile aerial sensor network platform for indoor emergency response application. The miniature, low-cost sensor platform has capabilities to self deploy, achieve three-dimensional sensing, and adapt to node and network disruptions in harsh environments. We describe hardware design trade-offs, the software architecture, and the implementation that enables limited-capability nodes to collectively achieve application goals. Through the indoor fire monitoring application scenario, we validate that the platform can achieve coverage and sensing accuracy that matches or exceeds static sensor networks and provide higher adaptability and autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Emerging smart cities are typically equipped with thousands of outdoor cameras. However, these cameras are usually not calibrated, i.e., information such as their precise mounting height and orientation is not available. Calibrating these cameras allows measurement of real-world distances from the video, thereby enabling a wide range of novel applications such as identifying speeding vehicles and city road planning . Unfortunately, robust camera calibration is a manual process today and is not scalable. In this article, we propose AutoCalib, a system for scalable, automatic calibration of traffic cameras. AutoCalib exploits deep learning to extract selected key-point features from car images in the video and uses a novel filtering and aggregation algorithm to automatically produce a robust estimate of the camera calibration parameters from just hundreds of samples. We have implemented AutoCalib as a service on Azure that takes in a video segment and computes the camera calibration parameters. Using video from real-world traffic cameras, we show that AutoCalib is able to estimate real-world distances with an error of less than 12%.",

    "abstract": "Carpooling has long held the promise of reducing gas consumption by decreasing mileage to deliver coriders. Although ad hoc carpools already exist in the real world through private arrangements, little research on the topic has been done. In this article, we present the first systematic work to design, implement, and evaluate a carpool service, called coRide , in a large-scale taxicab network intended to reduce total mileage for less gas consumption. Our coRide system consists of three components, a dispatching cloud server, passenger clients, and an onboard customized device, called TaxiBox . In the coRide design, in response to the delivery requests of passengers, dispatching cloud servers calculate cost-efficient carpool routes for taxicab drivers and thus lower fares for the individual passengers. To improve coRide ’s efficiency in mileage reduction, we formulate an NP-hard route calculation problem under different practical constraints. We then provide (1) an optimal algorithm using Linear Programming, (2) a 2-approximation algorithm with a polynomial complexity, and (3) its corresponding online version with a linear complexity. To encourage coRide ’s adoption, we present a win-win fare model as the incentive mechanism for passengers and drivers to participate. We test the performance of coRide by a comprehensive evaluation with a real-world trial implementation and a data-driven simulation with 14,000 taxi data from the Chinese city Shenzhen. The results show that compared with the ground truth, our service can reduce 33% of total mileage; with our win-win fare model, we can lower passenger fares by 49% and simultaneously increase driver profit by 76%.",

    "abstract": "Activity recognition is an important component of many pervasive computing applications. Radio-based activity recognition has the advantage that it does not have the privacy concern compared with camera-based solutions, and subjects do not have to carry a device on them. It has been shown channel state information (CSI) can be used for activity recognition in a device-free setting. With the proliferation of wireless devices, it is important to understand how radio frequency interference (RFI) can impact on pervasive computing applications. In this article, we investigate the impact of RFI on device-free CSI-based location-oriented activity recognition. We present data to show that RFI can have a significant impact on the CSI vectors. In the absence of RFI, different activities give rise to different CSI vectors that can be differentiated visually. However, in the presence of RFI, the CSI vectors become much noisier, and activity recognition also becomes harder. Our extensive experiments show that the performance may degrade significantly with RFI. We then propose a number of countermeasures to mitigate the impact of RFI and improve the performance. We are also the first to use complex-valued CSI along with the state-of-the-art Sparse Representation Classification method to enhance the performance in the environment with RFI.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) swarms provide promising solutions for situational awareness in applications such as environmental monitoring, urban surveillance, search and rescue, and so on. However, these scenarios do not provide localization infrastructure and limit cost and size of on-board capabilities of individual nodes, which makes it challenging for nodes to autonomously navigate to suitable preassigned locations. In this article, we present H-DrunkWalk , a collaborative and adaptive technique for heterogeneous MAV swarm navigation in environments not formerly preconditioned for operation. Working with heterogeneous MAV swarm, the H-DrunkWalk achieves high accuracy through collaboration but still maintains a low cost of the entire swarm. The heterogeneous MAV swarm consists of two types of nodes: (1) basic MAVs with limited sensing, communication, computing capabilities and (2) advanced MAVs with premium sensing, communication, computing capabilities. The key focus behind this networked MAV swarm research is to (1) rely on collaboration to overcome limitations of individual nodes and efficiently achieve system-wide sensing objectives and (2) fully take advantage of advanced MAVs to help basic MAVs improve their performance. The evaluations based on real MAV testbed experiments and large-scale physical-feature-based simulations show that compared to the traditional non-collaborative and non-adaptive method (dead reckoning with map bias), our system achieves up to 6× reductions in location estimation errors, and as much as 3× improvements in navigation success rate under the given time and accuracy constraints. In addition, by comprehensively considering the environment, heterogeneous structure, and quality of location estimation, our H-DrunkWalk brings 2× performance improvement (on average) as that of a hardware upgrade.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of nodes distributed in the region of interest (ROI) that forward collected data to the sink. The node’s location plays a vital role in data forwarding to enhance network efficiency by reducing the packet drop rate and energy consumption. WSN scenarios, such as tracking, smart cities, and agriculture applications, require location details to accomplish the objective. Assuming a 3D application space, a combination of received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (TOA) can be helpful for reliable range estimation of nodes. Notably, the anchor node can minimize localization error for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. We proposed an error minimization protocol for localization of the sensor node, assuming that the anchor node’s location is known prior and can limit the receiving signal in LOS, single, or twice reflection. We start to exploit the sensor node’s geometrical relationship and the anchor node for LOS and NLOS signals and address misclassification. We started initially from the erroneous node position, bound its volume in 3D space, and reduced volume with each iteration following the constraint. Our simulation result outperforms the traditional methods on many occasions, such as boundary volume and computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Many anomaly detection techniques have been adopted by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for improving self-diagnosing efficiency and infrastructures security. However, they are usually associated with the issues of computational-hungry and “black box.” Thus, it becomes important to ensure that the detection is not only accurate but also energy-efficient and trustworthy. In this article, we propose an Energy-efficient And Trustworthy Unsupervised anomaly detection framework (EATU) for IIoT. The framework consists of two levels of feature extraction: (1) Autoencoder-based feature extraction and (2) Efficient DeepExplainer-based explainable feature selection. We propose an Efficient DeepExplainer model based on perturbation-focused sampling, which demonstrates the most computational efficiency among state-of-the-art explainable models. With the important features selected by Efficient DeepExplainer, the rationale of why an anomaly detection decision was made is given, enhancing the trustworthiness of the detection as well as improving the accuracy of anomaly detection. Three real-world IIoT datasets with high-dimensional features are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that in comparison with the state-of-the-art, our framework has the attributes of improved accuracy, trustworthiness (in terms of correctness and stability of the explanation), and energy-efficiency (in terms of wall-clock-time and resource usage).",

    "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing systems typically operate centralized cloud storage management, and the environment data sensed by the participants are usually uploaded to certain central cloud servers. Instead, this article addresses the decentralized data storage problem in scenarios where cloud servers or network infrastructures do not work as expected and the sensing data have to be temporarily stored on the mobile devices carried by the participants. Considering that the sensing data are generally correlated, this article investigates a compressive distributed storage scheme for mobile crowdsensing. We notice a key observation: when a participant has a random walk in the target sensing area, his walking/sensing process can be considered as a random sampling for the entire area, although the activity of the participant may only have a local scope. We then propose an encoding algorithm based on compressive sensing theory. Each participant encodes the sensing data in their local trajectory, but the encoded CS measurement is capable of roughly reflecting the entire information of the whole area. While a participant stores a blurred global image of the target sensing area, the entire data can then be collaboratively stored by a certain number of participants. We further present a period-based data recovery algorithm to exploit the inter-period correlations, improving the recovery accuracy. Experimental results using real environmental data demonstrate the performance of the proposed compressive storage scheme.

Keeping in view the catastrophic destruction of this devastating virus, there is a must-need situation to maximize the use of existing healthcare technologies such as the healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT).

If the LoRa gateway can be jammed by attackers, it may not be able to receive any data from any nodes in the network. Our empirical study shows that although the LoRa physical layer (PHY) is robust and resilient by design, it is still vulnerable to synchronized jamming chirps. Potential protection solutions (e.g., collision recovery, parallel decoding) may fail to extract LoRa packets if an attacker transmits synchronized jamming chirps at higher power. To protect the LoRa PHY from such attacks, we propose a new protection method that can separate LoRa chirps from jamming chirps by leveraging their difference in power domain. We note that the new protection solution is orthogonal to existing solutions that leverage the chirp misalignment in the time domain or the frequency disparity in the frequency domain. We conduct experiments with COTS LoRa nodes and software-defined radios with varied experiment settings such as different spreading factors, bandwidths, and code rates. Results show that synchronized jamming chirps at high power can jam all previous solutions, whereas our protection solution can effectively protect LoRa gateways from the jamming attacks.",

Next, applying a Mixed Cluster Gaussian–Hidden Markov Model, we generate a respiration signal resembling that of wearable devices. Finally, we integrate the BreatheBand system into commercial WiFi infrastructure.

In this paper, we study the computation offloading problem for latency and privacy sensitive tasks in a hierarchical local-edge-cloud network by using federated learning method. Our goal is to minimize the operational time of latency-sensitive tasks requested by mobile devices that have data privacy concerns, while each task can be executed under local, edge or cloud computing mode with no need to rely on privacy data. We first build system models to analyze the latency incurred under different computing modes, and then develop a constrained optimization problem to minimize the latency consumed by the federated offloading collaboration. A Hierarchical Federated Averaging method based on Differential Evolution algorithm (HierFAVG-DE) is proposed for solving the problem in-hand, and extensive simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of our approach.",

Accurate crime prediction is significant for public safety promotion. However, the complicated spatial-temporal dependencies make the task challenging, due to two aspects: 1) spatial dependency of crime includes correlations with spatially adjacent regions and underlying correlations with distant regions, e.g. mobility connectivity and functional similarity; 2) there are near-repeat and long-range temporal correlations between crime occurrences across time. Most existing studies fall short in tackling with multi-view correlations, since they usually treat them equally without consideration of different weights for these correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel model for region-level crime prediction named as Heterogeneous Dynamic Multi-view Graph Neural Network (HDM-GNN). The model can represent the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies of crime with heterogeneous urban data, and fuse various types of region-wise correlations from multiple views. Global spatial dependencies and long-range temporal dependencies can be derived by integrating the multiple GAT modules and Gated CNN modules.

We present RACEME, a novel predictive EH-management framework by exploiting the embedded intelligence capability of energy-harvesting LoRa devices. It empowers energy-neutral operation in EH LoRa networks by leveraging the spatio-temporal correlation between EH LoRa sensors to optimize the harvested energy utilization. RACEME is an integrated system that consists of embedded machine learning (ML) for predictive EH management on the sensors and online cluster-based data reduction and recovery on the server. To maximize the accuracy of EH predictions, RACEME allows each sensor to implement an ML pipeline locally. Coupled with the cluster-based data-reduction feedback from the server, RACEME enables the sensors with higher harvested-energy availability and communication quality to transmit critical data more frequently in a probabilistic manner without sacrificing data quality. Compared with the state of the art, the experimental results reveal that RACEME improves EH prediction accuracy, network lifetime, and transmission overhead by up to 1.7, 2, and 8 times, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Multi-signature protocols allow a group of signers to collectively generate a single signature for a shared message. In the context of a decentralized blockchain, multi-signature schemes play a pivotal role in reducing the signature size. Recently, several multi-signature methods have emerged in the literature, some operating in discrete-log settings and others in lattice settings. However, many of the existing lattice-based multi-signature schemes incur high computation costs and online round complexity. Traditional public key-based multi-signature schemes are susceptible to quantum threats and they are computationally intensive as well. A lattice-based multi-signature can provide robust security, which often falls short in terms of efficiency when it comes to round complexity. In this article, we aim to introduce a single-round lattice-based multi-signature scheme specifically designed for decentralized public blockchains. What sets the proposed scheme apart is its ability to function without the need for trapdoor commitments or sample pre-images, which are common features in existing lattice-based signature methods. Furthermore, we explore some potential applications in a generic Internet of Things (IoT) environment and their integration of the proposed scheme with the blockchain technology. The security of the proposed scheme is based on lattice-hard problems, like Ring-SIS (Shortest Integer Solution) and Ring-LWE (Learning With Errors).",

    "abstract": "A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network of sensor nodes using low-power wireless technology to collect data in a region of interest (ROI). Due to their low energy, locating sensor nodes in large outdoor areas is challenging, which precludes GPS integration. WSNs typically comprise a small number of beacon nodes (BN) whose locations are known in advance, with most nodes deployed at unknown coordinates within the ROI. Endeavours to determine the locations of such unknown WSN nodes are largely based on the impractical assumption that every unknown node (UN) is within the communication range of BNs. Subsequently, these approaches utilise at least two BNs to determine the position of one UN. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) or Angle of Arrival (AoA) values of the signals from the BNs form the basis for such localisation. This paper suggests an iterative hybrid approach incorporating AoA and RSSI techniques, achieving accurate localisation with just one BN. The iterative method gradually covers the region, avoiding the unrealistic assumption of having all UNs within range. It also presents an innovative use of a unipolar stepper motor for AoA measurements. Experiments in a simulated environment and a real-world prototype validate the approach’s effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "LoRa networks have been deployed in many orchards for environmental monitoring and crop management. An accurate propagation model is essential for efficiently deploying a LoRa network in orchards, e.g. , determining gateway coverage and sensor placement. Although some propagation models have been studied for LoRa networks, they are not suitable for orchard environments, because they do not consider the shadowing effect on wireless propagation caused by the ground and tree canopies. This paper presents FLog , a propagation model for LoRa signals in orchard environments. FLog leverages a unique feature of orchards, i.e. , all trees have similar shapes and are planted regularly in space. We develop a 3D model of orchards. Once we have the location of a sensor and a gateway, we know the media that the wireless signal traverses. Based on this knowledge, we generate the First Fresnel Zone (FFZ) between the sender and the receiver. The intrinsic path loss exponents (PLE) of all media can be combined into a classic Log-Normal Shadowing model in the FFZ. Extensive experiments in almond orchards show that FLog reduces the link quality estimation error by 42.7% and improves gateway coverage estimation accuracy by 70.3%, compared with a widely used propagation model.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel foveated pre-rendering solution based on edge VR, which can further decrease latency by reducing the rendering workload and transmission data. We investigate the inherent connection between head and gaze movements in VR and present a multi-task learning model, FoANet, to jointly predict users’ head and gaze movements.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of networked devices and the surging demand for ubiquitous intelligence have given rise to the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). However, the utilization of high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and numerous radio frequency chains significantly raises power consumption. This paper explores a cost-effective solution using ternary ADCs (T-ADCs) in massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems for low-power AIoT and specifically addresses channel sensing challenges. The channel is first estimated through a pilot-aided scheme and refined using a joint-pilot-and-data (JPD) approach. To assess the performance limits of this two-threshold ADC system, the analysis includes its hardware-ideal counterpart, the parallel one-bit ADCs (PO-ADCs) and a realistic scenario where noise variance is unknown at the receiver is considered. Analytical findings indicate that the JPD scheme effectively mitigates performance degradation in channel estimation due to coarse quantization effects under mild conditions, without necessitating additional pilot overhead. For deterministic and random channels, we propose modified expectation maximization (EM) and variational inference EM estimators, respectively. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimators in terms of mean square error and symbol error rate, which showcases the feasibility of implementing T-ADCs and the associated JPD scheme for greener AIoT smart sensing.",

However, in real-world indoor environments, very few LoS signals are usable for accurate localization. This paper presents Bifrost , a novel hardware-software co-design to cope with this practical problem. The core idea of Bifrost is to reinvent WiFi signals to provide sufficient LoS signals. Specifically, we present a low-cost plug-in design of leaky wave antenna (LWA) that can generate orthogonal polarized signals: On one hand, LWA disperses signals of different frequencies to different angles, thus providing AoA information for the localized target. On the other hand, the target further leverages the antenna polarization mismatch to distinguish AoAs from different LWAs. Besides, fine-grained information in CSI is exploited to mitigate multipath and noise. Besides, a dedicated Kalman filter is proposed to facilitate the cooperation of Bifrost and SpotFi, a state-of-the-art approach, to enhance the availability and accuracy of SpotFi. The evaluation results show that the median localization error of Bifrost is 0.81m, 52.35% less than that of SpotFi. When combined with Bifrost to work in realistic settings, SpotFi can reduce the localization error by 33.54%.",

Compared with the existing ZigBee backscatter, EchScatter does not need to control the carrier, ensuring the universality of the transmitter. EchScatter has realized chip-level modulation of productive ambient ZigBee backscatter for the first time. It is capable of transmitting more tag bits simultaneously, thus increasing the throughput of the system. We first design 16 different 32-chip phase modulation sequences to realize the translation of any two ZigBee symbols. Therefore, our system can transmit four tag bits through one symbol. After that, we use an average energy detection-based synchronization method to make sure the synchronization error of the EchScatter meets the requirements of chip-level modulation. We prototyped EchScatter using an off-the-shelf FPGA and commodity ZigBee transceivers. Through extensive experiments and field studies, we show that EchScatter can work universally on commodity ZigBee transceivers. In line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios, EchScatter is able to achieve 247 kbps and 245 kbps throughput at a signal strength of around -60 dBm, respectively. The throughput of EchScatter is 32 times higher than that of FreeRider. We believe it will have more pervasive applications.",

We present several localized topology control strategies in which every wireless sensor maintains logical communication links to only a selected small subset of its physical neighbors using information of sensors within its local neighborhood in a heterogeneous network environment. We prove that the global logical network topologies formed by these locally selected links are sparse and/or power efficient and our methods are communication efficient. Here a structure is power efficient if the total power consumption of the least cost path connecting any two nodes in it is no more than a small constant factor of that in the original heterogeneous communication network. By utilizing the wireless broadcast channel capability, and assuming that a message sent by a sensor node will be received by all sensors within its transmission region with at most a constant number of transmissions, we prove that all our methods use at most O(n) total messages, where each message has O (log n ) bits.

    "abstract": "Recent research in sensor networks highlights the low-power mode operation of sensor networks. In wireless sensor networks, network lifetime can be extended by organizing sensors into mutually exclusive subsets and alternatively activating each subset. Coverage breach occurs when a subset fails to cover all the targets. In bandwidth-constrained sensor networks, coverage breach is more likely to happen because when active sensors periodically send data to the base station, contention for channel access must be considered. Channel bandwidth imposes a limit on the cardinality of each subset. To make efficient use of both energy and bandwidth with minimum coverage breach requires optimal arrangement of sensor nodes. This article addresses three coverage breach problems related to the low-power operation of wireless sensor networks where channel bandwidth is limited. The three coverage breach problems are formulated using integer linear programming models. A greedy approximation algorithm and a heuristic based on the LP-relaxation method are proposed. Effects of changing different network resources on sensor network coverage are studied through simulations. One consistent result is that when the number of sensors increases, network lifetime can be improved without loss of network coverage only if there is no bandwidth constraint; with bandwidth constraints, network lifetime may be improved further at the cost of coverage breach.",

    "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks, multiple flows from data collecting sensors to an aggregating sink could traverse paths that are largely interference coupled. These interference effects manifest themselves as congestion, and cause the flows to experience high packet loss and arbitrary packet delays. This is particularly problematic in event-based sensor networks (such as those in disaster recovery missions) where some flows are of greater importance than others and require a higher fidelity in terms of packet delivery and timeliness. In this paper we present COMUT (COngestion control for MUlti-class Traffic), a distributed cluster-based mechanism for supporting multiple classes of traffic in sensor networks. COMUT is based on the self-organization of the network into clusters , each of which autonomously and proactively monitors congestion within its localized scope. The clusters then exchange appropriate information to facilitate system wide rate control where, each data source, depending on the relative importance of its data flow and the experienced congestion en route the sink, is coerced into controlling its rate. Our simulation results demonstrate that (i) our techniques are highly effective in dealing with multiple, interfering flows and in achieving high delivery ratios and low delays compared to traditional approaches, (ii) operate successfully over multiple underlying routing protocols, (iii) provide higher throughput to higher importance flows, (iv) are responsive to failures and, finally, (v) achieve substantial energy savings due to the considerable reduction in packet drops via the effective regulation of the network load.",

An adversary armed with knowledge of the network deployment, routing algorithms, and the base-station (data sink) location can infer the temporal patterns of interesting events by merely monitoring the arrival of packets at the sink, thereby allowing the adversary to remotely track the spatio-temporal evolution of a sensed event. In this paper we introduce the problem of temporal privacy for delay-tolerant sensor networks, and propose adaptive buffering at intermediate nodes on the source-sink routing path to obfuscate temporal information from the adversary. We first present the effect of buffering on temporal privacy using an information-theoretic formulation, and then examine the effect that delaying packets has on buffer occupancy. We observe that temporal privacy and efficient buffer utilization are contrary objectives, and then present an adaptive buffering strategy that effectively manages these tradeoffs. Finally, we evaluate our privacy enhancement strategies using simulations, where privacy is quantified in terms of the adversary's mean square error.",

Anisotropic characteristics result from various factors such as the geographic shape of the region (nonconvex region), different node densities, irregular radio patterns, and anisotropic terrain conditions. In order to characterize anisotropic features, we devise a linear mapping method that projects one embedding space built upon proximity measures into geographic distance space by using the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) pseudo-inverse technique. This transformation retains as much topological information as possible and reduces the effect of measurement noise on the estimates of geographic distances. We show via simulation that the proposed localization method outperforms DV-hop, DV-distance, and MDS-MAP, and makes robust and accurate estimates of sensor locations in both isotropic and anisotropic sensor networks.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being used to monitor various parameters in a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. In many instances, environmental scientists are interested in collecting raw data using long-running queries injected into a WSN for analyzing at a later stage, rather than injecting snap-shot queries containing data-reducing operators (e.g., MIN, MAX, AVG) that aggregate data. Collection of raw data poses a challenge to WSNs as very large amounts of data need to be transported through the network. This not only leads to high levels of energy consumption and thus diminished network lifetime but also results in poor data quality as much of the data may be lost due to the limited bandwidth of present-day sensor nodes. We alleviate this problem by allowing certain nodes in the network to aggregate data by taking advantage of spatial and temporal correlations of various physical parameters and thus eliminating the transmission of redundant data. In this article we present a distributed scheduling algorithm that decides when a particular node should perform this novel type of aggregation. The scheduling algorithm autonomously reassigns schedules when changes in network topology, due to failing or newly added nodes, are detected. Such changes in topology are detected using cross-layer information from the underlying MAC layer. We first present the theoretical performance bounds of our algorithm. We then present simulation results, which indicate a reduction in message transmissions of up to 85% and an increase in network lifetime of up to 92% when compared to collecting raw data. Our algorithm is also capable of completely eliminating dropped messages caused by buffer overflow.",

We observe, based on testbed experiments, that a substantial percentage of links are asymmetric, many are even unidirectional. We also find that the reliability of synchronous acknowledgments is considerably higher than that of asynchronous messages. Thus the norm of estimating link quality bidirectionally via asynchronous beacons underestimates the link reliability of asymmetric links. This leads us to investigate how to exploit asymmetric links in order to improve network functions such as convergecast routing in sensor networks via one-way link estimation. We propose a new one-way link metric ETF (for the expected number of transmissions over forward links ) and present a local procedure for its estimation. We use ETF to identify reliable forward links, and we use dynamic retransmission thresholding for error control. Via experiments on testbeds of CC1000 radios and CC2420 radios (an IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio), we quantify the performance improvement in ETF as compared with ETX. We also study the performance improvement of ETF over ETX when no special mechanism is employed to discover asymmetric links or to control retransmissions.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we formalize the concept of tracking in a sensor network and develop a quantitative theory of trackability of weak models that investigates the rate of growth of the number of consistent tracks given a temporal sequence of observations made by the sensor network. The phenomenon being tracked is modelled by a nondeterministic finite automaton (a weak model) and the sensor network is modelled by an observer capable of detecting events related, typically ambiguously, to the states of the underlying automaton. Formally, an input string of symbols (the sensor network observations) that is presented to a nondeterministic finite automaton, M , (the weak model) determines a set of state sequences (the tracks or hypotheses) that are capable of generating the input string. We study the growth of the size of this candidate set of tracks as a function of the length of the input string. One key result is that for a given automaton and sensor coverage, the worst-case rate of growth is either polynomial or exponential in the number of observations, indicating a kind of phase transition in tracking accuracy. These results have applications to various tracking problems of recent interest involving tracking phenomena using noisy observations of hidden states such as: sensor networks, computer network security, autonomic computing and dynamic social network analysis.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the fundamental performance limits of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is of paramount importance to understand their behavior under the worst-case conditions and to make the appropriate design choices. This is particular relevant for time-sensitive WSN applications, where the timing behavior of the network protocols (message transmission must respect deadlines) impacts on the correct operation of these applications. In that direction this article contributes with a methodology based on Network Calculus, which enables quick and efficient worst-case dimensioning of static or even dynamically changing cluster-tree WSNs where the data sink can either be static or mobile. We propose closed-form recurrent expressions for computing the worst-case end-to-end delays, buffering and bandwidth requirements across any source-destination path in a cluster-tree WSN. We show how to apply our methodology to the case of IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee cluster-tree WSNs. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and analyze the accuracy of our methodology through a comprehensive experimental study using commercially available technology, namely TelosB motes running TinyOS.",

Our main result is that, by monitoring the status of just O (1/ε) nodes in the network, the base station can detect whenever an ε- cut occurs. Furthermore, this detection comes with a deterministic guarantee that every reported cut has size at least ε n /2.

One of the critical issues for enabling collaborative processing in WSNs is how to schedule tasks in a systematic way, including assigning tasks to sensor nodes, and determining their execution and communication sequence. Since WSN nodes are very resource constrained, mainly regarding their energy supply, one major concern when scheduling tasks in such environments is to minimize and balance the energy consumption, so that the system operational lifetime is maximized. We propose a heuristic-based three-phase algorithm (TPTS) for allocating tasks to multiple clusters in hierarchical WSNs that aims at finding a scheduling scheme that minimizes the overall energy consumption and balances the workload of the system while meeting the application's deadline. The performance of the proposed algorithm and the effect of several parameters on its behavior were evaluated by simulations, with promising results. The experimental results show that the time and energy performance of TPTS are close to the time and energy of benchmarks in most cases, while load balance is always provided.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are typically composed of low-cost sensors that are deeply integrated in physical environments. As a result, the sensing performance of a wireless sensor network is inevitably undermined by biases in imperfect sensor hardware and the noises in data measurements. Although a variety of calibration methods have been proposed to address these issues, they often adopt the device-level approach that becomes intractable for moderate-to large-scale networks. In this article, we propose a two-tier system-level calibration approach for a class of sensor networks that employ data fusion to improve the sensing performance. In the first tier of our calibration approach, each sensor learns its local sensing model from noisy measurements using an online algorithm and only transmits a few model parameters. In the second tier, sensors' local sensing models are then calibrated to a common system sensing model. Our approach fairly distributes computation overhead among sensors and significantly reduces the communication overhead of calibration compared with the device-level approach. Based on this approach, we develop an optimal model calibration scheme that maximizes the target detection probability of a sensor network under bounded false alarm rate. Our approach is evaluated by both experiments on a testbed of TelosB motes and extensive simulations based on synthetic datasets as well as data traces collected in a real vehicle detection experiment. The results demonstrate that our system-level calibration approach can significantly boost the detection performance of sensor networks in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios.",

    "abstract": "To offer flexible quality of service to several classes of applications, the medium access control (MAC) protocol of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks (WSNs) combines the advantages of a random access with contention with a time division multiple access (TDMA) without contention. Understanding reliability, delay, and throughput is essential to characterizing the fundamental limitations of the MAC and optimizing its parameters. Nevertheless, there is not yet a clear investigation of the achievable performance of hybrid MAC. In this article, an analytical framework for modeling the behavior of the hybrid MAC protocol of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is proposed. The main challenge for an accurate analysis is the coexistence of the stochastic behavior of the random access and the deterministic behavior of the TDMA scheme. The analysis is done in three steps. First, the contention access scheme of the IEEE 802.15.4 exponential back-off process is modeled through an extended Markov chain that takes into account channel, retry limits, acknowledgements, unsaturated traffic, and superframe period. Second, the behavior of the TDMA access scheme is modeled by another Markov chain. Finally, the two chains are coupled to obtain a complete model of the hybrid MAC. By using this model, the network performance in terms of reliability, average packet delay, average queuing delay, and throughput is evaluated through both theoretical analysis and experiments. The protocol has been implemented and evaluated on a testbed with off-the-shelf wireless sensor devices to demonstrate the utility of the analysis in a practical setup. It is established that the probability density function of the number of received packets per superframe follows a Poisson distribution. It is determined under which conditions the guaranteed time slot allocation mechanism of IEEE 802.15.4 is stable. It is shown that the mutual effect between throughput of the random access and the TDMA scheme for a fixed superframe length is critical to maximizing the overall throughput of the hybrid MAC. In high traffic load, the throughput of the random access mechanism dominates over TDMA due to the constrained use of TDMA in the standard. Furthermore, it is shown that the effect of imperfect channels and carrier sensing on system performance heavily depends on the traffic load and limited range of the protocol parameters. Finally, it is argued that the traffic generation model established in this article may be used to design an activation timer mechanism in a modified version of the CSMA/CA algorithm that guarantees a stable network performance.",

In this article, we provide an exposition of our efforts to build a low-bandwidth wireless camera network platform, called CITRIC, and its applications in smart camera networks. The platform integrates a camera, a microphone, a frequency-scalable (up to 624 MHz) CPU, 16 MB FLASH, and 64 MB RAM onto a single device. The device then connects with a standard sensor network mote to form a wireless camera mote. With reasonably low power consumption and extensive algorithmic libraries running on a decent operating system that is easy to program, CITRIC is ideal for research and applications in distributed image and video processing. Its capabilities of in-network image processing also reduce communication requirements, which has been high in other existing camera networks with centralized processing. Furthermore, the mote easily integrates with other low-bandwidth sensor networks via the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. To justify the utility of CITRIC, we present several representative applications. In particular, concrete research results will be demonstrated in two areas, namely, distributed coverage hole identification and distributed object recognition.",

We study the coverage of a line interval with a set of wireless sensors with adjustable coverage ranges. Each coverage range of a sensor is an interval centered at that sensor whose length is decided by the power the sensor chooses. The objective is to find a range assignment with the minimum cost. There are two variants of the optimization problem. In the discrete variant, each sensor can only choose from a finite set of powers, whereas in the continuous variant, each sensor can choose power from a given interval. For the discrete variant of the problem, a polynomial-time exact algorithm is designed. For the continuous variant of the problem, NP-hardness of the problem is proved and followed by an ILP formulation. Then, constant-approximation algorithms are designed when the cost for all sensors is proportional to r κ for some constant κ ≥ 1, where r is the covering radius corresponding to the chosen power. Specifically, if κ = 1, we give a 1.25-approximation algorithm and a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme; if κ &gt; 1, we give a 2-approximation algorithm. We also show that the approximation analyses are tight.",

These patterns are optimal under most combinations of communication and sensing ranges. We also introduce with detailed analysis several fundamental theorems and conjectures.

This device heterogeneity is explicitly addressed by modeling the coverage problem through Voronoi-Laguerre diagrams that, differently from Voronoi diagrams, allow for correctly identifying each sensor coverage region depending on the sensor current radius and the radii of its neighboring nodes. SARA executes quickly with guaranteed termination and, given the currently available nodes, it always guarantees maximum coverage. By means of extensive simulations, we show that SARA obtains remarkable improvements with respect to previous solutions, ensuring, in networks with heterogeneous nodes, longer network lifetime and wider coverage.",

A common method employed for this purpose is duty-cycled operation, which extends battery lifetime yet incurs several types of energy wastes and challenges. A promising alternative to duty-cycled operation is the use of wake-up radio (WuR), where the main microcontroller unit (MCU) and transceiver, that is, the two most energy-consuming elements, are kept in energy-saving mode until a special signal from another node is received by an attached, secondary, ultra-low power receiver. Next, this so-called wake-up receiver generates an interrupt to activate the receiver node's MCU and, consequently, the main radio. This article presents a complete wake-up radio design that targets simplicity in design for the monetary cost and flexibility concerns, along with a good operation range and very low power consumption. Both the transmitter (WuTx) and the receiver (WuRx) designs are presented with the accompanying physical experiments for several design alternatives. Detailed analysis of the end system is provided in terms of both operational distance (more than 10 m) and current consumption (less than 1 μA). As a reference, a commercial WuR system is analyzed and compared to the presented system by expressing the trade-offs and advantages of both systems.",

As a complementary solution to detecting nodes with functional faults, this article, proposes FIND, a novel method to detect nodes with data faults that neither assumes a particular sensing model nor requires costly event injections. After the nodes in a network detect a natural event, FIND ranks the nodes based on their sensing readings as well as their physical distances from the event. FIND works for systems where the measured signal attenuates with distance. A node is considered faulty if there is a significant mismatch between the sensor data rank and the distance rank. Theoretically, we show that average ranking difference is a provable indicator of possible data faults. FIND is extensively evaluated in simulations and two test bed experiments with up to 25 MicaZ nodes. Evaluation shows that FIND has a less than 5% miss detection rate and false alarm rate in most noisy environments.",

We propose a novel localized algorithm, named Back-Tracking Deployment (BTD). To construct a full coverage solution over the ROI, mobile robots (carriers) carry static sensors as payloads and drop them at the visited empty vertices of a virtual square, triangular, or hexagonal grid. A single robot will move in a predefined order of directional preference until a dead end is reached. Then it back-tracks to the nearest sensor adjacent to an empty vertex (an “entrance” to an unexplored/uncovered area) and resumes regular forward movement and sensor dropping from there. To save movement steps, the back-tracking is carried out along a locally identified shortcut. We extend the algorithm to support multiple robots that move independently and asynchronously. Once a robot reaches a dead end, it will back-track, giving preference to its own path. Otherwise, it will take over the back-track path of another robot by consulting with neighboring sensors. We prove that BTD terminates within finite time and produces full coverage when no (sensor or robot) failures occur. We also describe an approach to tolerate failures and an approach to balance workload among robots. We then evaluate BTD in comparison with the only competing algorithms SLD [Chang et al. 2009a] and LRV [Batalin and Sukhatme 2004] through simulation. In a specific failure-free scenario, SLD covers only 40--50% of the ROI, whereas BTD covers it in full. BTD involves significantly (80%) less robot moves and messages than LRV.",

    "abstract": "Tracking persons with multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view instead of with one camera leads to more robust decisions. However, operating multiple cameras instead of one requires more processing power and communication bandwidth, which are limited resources in practical networks. When the fields of view of different cameras overlap, not all cameras are equally needed for localizing a tracking target. When only a selected set of cameras do processing and transmit data to track the target, a substantial saving of resources is achieved. The recent introduction of smart cameras with on-board image processing and communication hardware makes such a distributed implementation of tracking feasible. We present a novel framework for selecting cameras to track people in a distributed smart camera network that is based on generalized information-theory. By quantifying the contribution of one or more cameras to the tracking task, the limited network resources can be allocated appropriately, such that the best possible tracking performance is achieved. With the proposed method, we dynamically assign a subset of all available cameras to each target and track it in difficult circumstances of occlusions and limited fields of view with the same accuracy as when using all cameras.",

    "abstract": "Duty cycling improves energy efficiency but limits throughput and introduces significant end-to-end delay in wireless sensor networks. In this article, we present a traffic-adaptive synchronous MAC protocol (TAS-MAC), which is a high-throughput, low-delay MAC protocol tailored for low power consumption. It achieves high throughput by adapting time division multiple access (TDMA) to a novel traffic-adaptive allocation mechanism that assigns time slots only to nodes located on active routes. TAS-MAC reduces the end-to-end delay by notifying all nodes on active routes of incoming traffic in advance. These nodes will claim time slots for data transmission and forward a packet through multiple hops in a cycle. The desirable traffic-adaptive feature is achieved by decomposing traffic notification and data-transmission scheduling into two phases, specializing their duties and improving their efficiency, respectively. Simulation results and experiments on TelosB motes demonstrate that the two-phase design significantly improves the throughput of current synchronous MAC protocols and achieves the similar low delay of slot-stealing-assisted TDMA with much lower power consumption.",

Multicamera video summarization seeks to make this task more tractable by generating a reduced set of output summary videos that concisely capture important portions of the input set. We present a system that approaches summarization at the level of detected activity motifs and shortens the input videos by compacting the representation of individual activities. Additionally, redundancy is removed across camera views by omitting from the summary activity occurrences that can be predicted by other occurrences. The system also detects anomalous events within a unified framework and can highlight them in the summary. Our contributions are a method for selecting useful parts of an activity to present to a viewer using activity motifs and a novel framework to score the importance of activity occurrences and allow transfer of importance between temporally related activities without solving the correspondence problem.

To achieve the full potential of such drones, it is necessary to develop new enhanced formulations of both common and emerging sensing scenarios. Namely, several fundamental challenges in visual sensing are yet to be solved including (1) fitting sizable targets in camera frames; (2) positioning cameras at effective viewpoints matching target poses; and (3) accounting for occlusion by elements in the environment, including other targets. In this article, we introduce Argus, an autonomous system that utilizes drones to collect target information incrementally through a two-tier architecture. To tackle the stated challenges, Argus employs a novel geometric model that captures both target shapes and coverage constraints. Recognizing drones as the scarcest resource, Argus aims to minimize the number of drones required to cover a set of targets. We prove this problem is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate, before deriving a best-possible approximation algorithm along with a competitive sampling heuristic which runs up to 100× faster according to large-scale simulations. To test Argus in action, we demonstrate and analyze its performance on a prototype implementation. Finally, we present a number of extensions to accommodate more application requirements and highlight some open problems.",

We propose a novel contour-based gesture model that converts human gestures to contours in 3D space and then recognizes the contours as characters. Different from 2D contours, the 3D contours may have the problems such as contour distortion caused by different viewing angles, contour difference caused by different writing directions, and the contour distribution across different planes. To address the above problem, we introduce Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to detect the principal/writing plane in 3D space, and then tune the projected 2D contour in the principal plane through reversing, rotating, and normalizing operations, to make the 2D contour in right orientation and normalized size under a uniform view. After that, we propose both an online approach, AC-Vec, and an offline approach, AC-CNN, for character recognition. The experimental results show that AC-Vec achieves an accuracy of 91.6% and AC-CNN achieves an accuracy of 94.3% for gesture/character recognition, both outperforming the existing approaches.",

Many researchers are engaged in developing innovative design paradigms to address security issues by developing trust management systems. In WSN, trust is important for the establishment of cooperation among the sensor nodes. The article presents a sociopsychological model for detecting fraudulent nodes in WSN.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel concurrent ranging technique for distance estimation with ultra-wideband (UWB) radios. Conventional schemes assume that the necessary packet exchanges occur in isolation to avoid collisions. Concurrent ranging relies on the overlapping of replies from nearby responders to the same ranging request issued by an initiator node. As UWB transmissions rely on short pulses, the individual times of arrival can be discriminated by examining the channel impulse response (CIR) of the initiator transceiver. By ranging against N responders with a single , concurrent exchange, our technique drastically abates network overhead, enabling higher ranging frequency with lower latency and energy consumption w.r.t. conventional schemes. Concurrent ranging can be implemented with a strawman approach requiring minimal changes to standard schemes. Nevertheless, we empirically show that this limits the attainable accuracy, reliability, and therefore applicability. We identify the main challenges in realizing concurrent ranging without dedicated hardware and tackle them by contributing several techniques, used in synergy in our prototype based on the popular DW1000 transceiver. Our evaluation, with static targets and a mobile robot, confirms that concurrent ranging reliably achieves decimeter-level distance and position accuracy, comparable to conventional schemes but at a fraction of the network and energy cost.",

However, realizing such complex computation on resource-constrained wireless sensors is inefficient and even impossible on some devices. In this work, we introduce a new AKA scheme with PFS for WSNs without using any public key cryptographic primitive. To achieve PFS, we rely on a new dynamic one-time authentication credential that is regularly updated in each session. In particular, each value of the authentication credential is wisely associated with at most one session key that enables us to fulfill the security goal of PFS. Furthermore, the proposed scheme enables the principals to identify whether they have been impersonated previously. We highlight that our scheme can be very efficiently implemented on sensors since only hash function and XOR operation are required.",

    "abstract": "With the remarkable proliferation of smart mobile devices, mobile crowdsensing has emerged as a compelling paradigm to collect and share sensor data from surrounding environment. In many application scenarios, due to unavailable wireless network or expensive data transfer cost, it is desirable to offload crowdsensing data traffic on opportunistic device-to-device (D2D) networks. However, coupling between mobile crowdsensing and D2D networks, it raises new technical challenges caused by intermittent routing and indeterminate settings. Considering the operations of data sensing, relaying, aggregating, and uploading simultaneously, in this article, we study collaborative mobile crowdsensing in opportunistic D2D networks. Toward the concerns of sensing data quality, network performance and incentive budget, Minimum-Delay-Maximum-Coverage (MDMC) problem and Minimum-Overhead-Maximum-Coverage (MOMC) problem are formalized to optimally search a complete set of crowdsensing task execution schemes over user, temporal, and spatial three dimensions. By exploiting mobility traces of users, we propose an unified graph-based problem representation framework and transform MDMC and MOMC problems to a connection routing searching problem on weighted directed graphs. Greedy-based recursive optimization approaches are proposed to address the two problems with a divide-and-conquer mode. Empirical evaluation on both real-world and synthetic datasets validates the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches.",

To schedule a mobile charger to move along a predesigned trajectory to charge devices, most existing studies assume that the precise location information of devices is already known. Unfortunately, this assumption does not always hold in real mobile application, because the activities of the vast majority of mobile devices carried by mobile agents appear dynamic and random. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how to wirelessly charge mobile devices with non-deterministic mobility. We aim to provide effective charging service to them, subject to the energy capacity of the mobile charger. We formalize the effective charging problem as a charging reward maximization problem ( CRMP ), where the amount of reward obtained by charging a device is inversely proportional to the residual lifetime of the device. Then, we prove that CRMP is NP-hard. To derive an effective charging heuristic, an algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning ( RL ) is proposed. The evaluation results show that the RL-based charging algorithm achieves excellent charging effectiveness. We further interpret the learned heuristic to gain deep and valuable insights into the design options.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advancement of industrial internet of things (IoT) technology has changed the supply chain network to an open system to meet the high demand for individualized products and provide better customer experiences. However the open-system supply chain has forced many small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) to adopt vertical integration by being divided into smaller companies with a distinctive business for each SME but a central alliance to produce a range of products and gain competencies. Therefore, existing models do not guarantee the protection of data privacy of individual SMEs. Moreover, especially for the IoT environment, collecting data in a secure way and revealing valuable knowledge in an IoT network is difficult. How to share data in a secure framework is of paramount importance in the internet of behavior field. In this article, a privacy-preserving data-mining framework is proposed for joint-venture industrial collaborative activities by combining federated learning and a “pre-large concept” of data-mining techniques. The novelty of the proposed approach is that, while mining high-utility itemsets (HUIs) from multiple datasets, it does not require direct data sharing. In the proposed method, the federated-learning framework can learn from aggregated learning parameters without scanning all data from different sets. The pre-large concept in this approach reduces the amount of scanning into different datasets. Thus, the approach makes it possible to train federated learning more quickly while protecting the privacy of individual data owners. The approach has been tested on real industrial datasets in a collaborative environment. Extensive experimental results show that the approach achieves high accuracy compared with conventional data-mining techniques while preserving the privacy of datasets.",

We design a set of novel algorithms to extract multiple drowsiness-related indicators covering major categories of human factors. In particular, we demonstrate that commodity PPG sensors can be utilized to detect yawning behavior; it contributes as an important indicator for drowsiness detection. The core of FDWatch is based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. It considers different indicators as evidence describing the state of the driver from different angles. To make the extracted indicators applicable to Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, we employ backpropagation neural networks to obtain the basic probability assignment. Moreover, we propose a similarity-distance-based method to handle evidence conflicts. Extensive experiments with real-road driving data show that FDWatch can accurately detect driver drowsiness with a missing alarm rate of 3.57% and a false alarm rate of 3.68%.",

    "abstract": "Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has become a powerful sensing paradigm that allows requesters to outsource sensing tasks to a crowd of mobile users. Aware of the paramount importance of incentivizing participation for MCS, researchers have proposed various incentive mechanisms. Most mechanisms assume that the MCS platform can collect sufficient budget to recruit users, and hence only focus on incentivizing users. In this work, we consider MCS systems where the budget of a single task is insufficient for user recruitment. Commonly, a task requester with a simple task (e.g., inquiring a photo of a restaurant) only provides a small budget, while a user wants to earn a larger reward for his effort (e.g., traveling a long distance to take a photo). To address this disparity issue, we propose novel task-bundling-based two-stage incentive mechanisms to incentivize both requesters and users. Specifically, tasks are first clustered as bundles, where the budgets in one bundle are collected through a random partition method. Then, a double auction is conducted, which sorts budgets and bids to maximize matching. Through theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms satisfy computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget balance, truthfulness, and constant competitiveness.",

In this paper we present our “opportunistic” interpretation, which advances the traditional DT concept and provides a valid support for enabling next-generation solutions in dynamic, distributed and large scale scenarios as smart cities. Indeed, by collecting simple data from the environment and by opportunistically elaborating them through AI techniques directly at the network edge (also referred to as Edge Intelligence), a digital version of a physical object can be built from the bottom up as well as dynamically manipulated and operated in a data-driven manner, thus enabling prompt responses to external stimuli and effective command actuation. To demonstrate the viability of our Opportunistic Digital Twin (ODT) a real use case focused on a traffic prediction task has been incrementally developed and presented, showing improved inference performance and reduced network latency, bandwidth and power consumption.",

In this article, we propose MNP, a multihop reprogramming service designed for sensor networks. One of the problems in reprogramming is the issue of message collision. To reduce the problem of collision, we propose a sender selection algorithm that attempts to guarantee that in a given neighborhood there is at most one source transmitting the program at a time. Furthermore, our sender selection is greedy in that it tries to select the sender that is expected to have the most impact. We use pipelining to enable fast data propagation. MNP is energy efficient because it reduces the active radio time of a sensor node by putting the node into “sleep” state when its neighbors are transmitting a segment that is not of interest. We call this type of sleep contention sleep. To further reduce the energy consumption, we add noreq sleep, where sensor node goes to sleep if none of its neighbors is interested in receiving the segment it is advertising. We also introduce an optional init sleep to reduce the energy consumption in the initial phase of reprogramming. Finally, we investigate the performance of MNP in different network settings.",

In this article, we examine the performance of such a sensor network for tracking multiple targets. We begin with geometric arguments that address the problem of counting the number of distinct targets, given a snapshot of the sensor readings. We provide necessary and sufficient criteria for an accurate target count in a one-dimensional setting, and provide a greedy algorithm that determines the minimum number of targets that is consistent with the sensor readings. While these combinatorial arguments bring out the difficulty of target counting based on sensor readings at a given time, they leave open the possibility of accurate counting and tracking by exploiting the evolution of the sensor readings over time. To this end, we develop a particle filtering algorithm based on a cost function that penalizes changes in velocity. An extensive set of simulations, as well as experiments with passive infrared sensors, are reported. We conclude that, despite the combinatorial complexity of target counting, probabilistic approaches based on fairly generic models of trajectories yield respectable tracking performance.",

The specific application on which we illustrate our mechanism is that of GlacsWeb. This is a deployed system that uses battery-powered sensors to collect environmental data related to glaciers which it transmits back to a base station so that it can be made available world-wide to researchers. In this context, we first develop a sensing protocol in which each sensor locally adjusts its sensing rate based on the value of the data it believes it will observe. The sensors employ a Bayesian linear model to decide their sampling rate and exploit the properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence to place an appropriate value on the data. Then, we detail a communication protocol that finds optimal routes for relaying this data back to the base station based on the cost of communicating it (derived from the opportunity cost of using the battery power for relaying data). Finally, we empirically evaluate our protocol by examining the impact on efficiency of a static network topology, a dynamic network topology, the size of the network, the degree of dynamism of the environment, and the mobility of the nodes. In so doing, we demonstrate that the efficiency gains of our new protocol, over the currently implemented method over a 6 month period, are 78%, 133%, 100%, and 93%, respectively. Furthermore, we show that our system performs at 65%, 70%, 63%, and 70% of the theoretical optimal, respectively, despite being a distributed protocol that operates with incomplete knowledge of the environment.",

This simulation provides sufficient accuracy to guide specific design choices in a large design space.

With our simulation suite, micro-solar power systems can be designed in a systematic fashion. Putting the model and empirical vehicle together, the design choices in each component of a micro-solar power system are studied to reach a deployable candidate. The deployment is evaluated by analyzing the effects of different solar profiles across the network. The analysis from the deployment can be used to refine the next system-design iteration.",

    "abstract": "Data aggregation is necessary for extending the network lifetime of wireless sensor nodes with limited processing and power capabilities, since energy expended in transmitting a single data bit would be at least several orders of magnitude higher when compared to that needed for a 32-bit computation. Therefore, in this article, a novel nonlinear adaptive pulse coded modulation-based compression (NADPCMC) scheme is proposed for data aggregation in a wireless sensor network (WSN). The NADPCMC comprises of two estimators—one at the source or transmitter and the second one at the destination node. The estimator at the source node approximates the data value for each sample. The difference between the data sample and its estimate is quantized and transmitted to the next hop node instead of the actual data sample, thus reducing the amount of data transmission and rending energy savings. A similar estimator at the next hop node or base station reconstructs the original data. It is demonstrated that repeated application of the NADPCMC scheme along the route in a WSN results in data aggregation. Satisfactory performance of the proposed scheme in terms of distortion, compression ratio, and energy efficiency and in the presence of estimation and quantization errors for data aggregation is demonstrated using the Lyapunov approach. Then the performance of the proposed scheme is contrasted with the available compression schemes in an NS-2 environment through several benchmarking datasets. Simulation and hardware results demonstrate that almost 50% energy savings with low distortion levels below 5% and low overhead are observed when compared to no compression. Iteratively applying the proposed compression scheme at the cluster head nodes along the routes over the network yields an additional improvement of 20% in energy savings per aggregation with an overall distortion below 8%.",

An obvious solution is to duty cycle the GPS module, which prolongs the device lifetime at the cost of increased position uncertainty while the GPS is off. This article addresses the trade-off between energy consumption and localization performance in a mobile sensor network application. The focus is on augmenting GPS location with more energy-efficient location sensors to bound position estimate uncertainty while GPS is off. Empirical GPS and radio contact data from a large-scale animal tracking deployment is used to model node mobility, radio performance, and GPS. Because GPS takes a considerable, and variable, time after powering up before it delivers a good position measurement, we model the GPS behavior through empirical measurements of two GPS modules. These models are then used to explore duty cycling strategies for maintaining position uncertainty within specified bounds. We then explore the benefits of using short-range radio contact logging alongside GPS as an energy-inexpensive means of lowering uncertainty while the GPS is off, and we propose strategies that use RSSI ranging and GPS back-offs to further reduce energy consumption. Results show that our combined strategies can cut node energy consumption by one third while still meeting application-specific positioning criteria.",

In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), provenance is critical for many different purposes, including assessing the trustworthiness of data acquired and forwarded by sensors, supporting situation awareness, and detecting early signs of attacks. However, a major drawback in provenance for WSNs is its size. It is thus critical to develop efficient techniques for provenance encoding. A major issue of previously proposed provenance encoding techniques is that the size of the provenance either expands too fast with increases in the number of packet transmission hops or is very sensitive to the WSN’s topology, i.e., the size of the provenance expands drastically with changes in the WSN’s topology. In this article, we propose a novel provenance encoding technique based on dynamic Bayesian network and overlapped arithmetic coding scheme, which addresses such an issue.

Lexicographic max-min (LM) rate allocation is a good solution but is nontrivial for multihop WSNs, as both fairness and sensing rates have to be optimized through the exploration of all possible forwarding routes in the network. All current optimal approaches to this problem are centralized and offline, suffering from low scalability and large computational complexity—typically solving O( N 2 ) linear programming problems for N -node WSNs. This article presents the first optimal distributed solution to this problem with much lower complexity. We apply it to solar-powered wireless sensor networks (SP-WSNs) to achieve both LM optimality and sustainable operation. Based on realistic models of both time-varying solar power and photovoltaic-battery hardware, we propose an optimization framework that integrates a local power management algorithm with a global distributed LM rate allocation scheme. The optimality, convergence, and efficiency of our approaches are formally proven. We also evaluate our algorithms via experiments on both solar-powered MICAz motes and extensive simulations using real solar energy data and practical power parameter settings. The results verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate how our approach outperforms both the state-of-the-art centralized optimal and distributed heuristic solutions.",

It offers an efficient framework to tackle the challenge of limited resources in large-scale sensor networks. Currently, existing works only studied the theoretical foundation of how to decide the deployment density of sensors to ensure the desired degree of trap coverage. However, practical issues, such as how to efficiently schedule sensor node to guarantee trap coverage under an arbitrary deployment, are still left untouched. In this article, we formally formulate the Minimum Weight Trap Cover Problem and prove it is an NP-hard problem. To solve the problem, we introduce a bounded approximation algorithm, called Trap Cover Optimization (TCO) to schedule the activation of sensors while satisfying specified trap coverage requirement. We design Localized Trap Coverage Protocol as the localized implementation of TCO. The performance of Minimum Weight Trap Coverage we find is proved to be at most O (ρ) times of the optimal solution, where ρ is the density of sensor nodes in the region.

While TSCH outperforms single-channel communications, cross-technology interference on the license-free ISM bands may affect the performance of TSCH-based WSNs. For applications such as in-vehicle networks for which interference is dynamic over time, it leads to non-guaranteed reliability of the communications over time. This article proposes an Enhanced version of the TSCH protocol together with a Distributed Channel Sensing technique (ETSCH+DCS) that dynamically detects good quality channels to be used for communication. The quality of channels is extracted using a combination of a central and a distributed channel-quality estimation technique. The central technique uses Non-Intrusive Channel-quality Estimation (NICE) technique that proactively performs energy detections in the idle part of each timeslot at the coordinator of the network. NICE enables ETSCH to follow dynamic interference, while it does not reduce throughput of the network. The distributed channel quality estimation technique is executed by all the nodes in the network, based on their communication history, to detect interference sources that are hidden from the coordinator. We did two sets of lab experiments with controlled interferers and a number of simulations using real-world interference datasets to evaluate ETSCH. Experimental and simulation results show that ETSCH improves reliability of network communications, compared to basic TSCH and the state-of-the-art solution. In some experimental scenarios NICE itself has been able to increase the average packet reception ratio by 22% and shorten the length of burst packet losses by half, compared to the plain TSCH protocol. Further experiments show that DCS can reduce the effect of hidden interference (which is not detectable by NICE) on the packet reception ratio of the affected links by 50%.",

    "abstract": "Body Area Networks (BANs) are becoming increasingly popular and have shown great potential in real-time monitoring of the human body. With the promise of being cost-effective and unobtrusive and facilitating continuous monitoring, BANs have attracted a wide range of monitoring applications, including medical and healthcare, sports, and rehabilitation systems. Most of these applications are real time and life critical and require a strict guarantee of Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of timeliness, reliability, and so on. Recently, there has been a number of proposals describing diverse approaches or frameworks to achieve QoS in BANs (i.e., for different layers or tiers and different protocols). This survey put these individual efforts into perspective and presents a more holistic view of the area. In this regard, this article identifies a set of QoS requirements for BAN applications and shows how these requirements are linked in a three-tier BAN system and presents a comprehensive review of the existing proposals against those requirements. In addition, open research issues, challenges, and future research directions in achieving these QoS in BANs are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Industrial applications and cyber-physical systems rely on real-time wireless networks to deliver data in a timely and reliable manner. However, existing solutions provide these guarantees only for stationary nodes. In this article, we present REWIMO, a solution for real-time and reliable communications in mobile networks. REWIMO has a two-tier architecture composed of (i) infrastructure nodes and (ii) mobile nodes that associate with infrastructure nodes as they move. REWIMO employs an on-join bandwidth reservation approach and benefits from a set of techniques to efficiently reserve bandwidth for each mobile node at the time of its admission and over its potential data forwarding paths. To ensure association of mobile nodes with infrastructure nodes over high-quality links, REWIMO uses the two-phase scheduling technique to coordinate neighbor discovery with data transmission. To mitigate the overhead of handling network dynamics, REWIMO employs an additive scheduling algorithm, which is capable of additive bandwidth reservation without modifying existing schedules. Compared to the algorithms used by static real-time wireless networks, the techniques and the algorithms employed by REWIMO result in a significant increase in real-time capacity, enhanced reliability, and considerably faster handling of network dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Access to large amounts of real-world data has long been a barrier to the development and evaluation of analytics applications for the built environment. Open datasets exist, but they are limited in their span (how much data is available) and context (what kind of data is available and how it is described). Evaluation of such analytics is also limited by how the analytics themselves are implemented, often using hard-coded names of building components, points and locations, or unique input data formats. To advance the methodology for how such analytics are implemented and evaluated, we present Mortar: an open testbed for portable building analytics, currently spanning 90 buildings and containing over 9.1 billion data points. All buildings in the testbed are described using Brick, a recently developed metadata schema, providing rich functional descriptions of building assets and subsystems. We also propose a simple architecture for writing portable analytics applications that are robust to the diversity of buildings and can configure themselves based on context. We demonstrate the utility of Mortar by implementing 11 applications from the literature.",

    "abstract": "Occupant identification proves crucial in many smart home applications such as automated home control and activity recognition. Previous solutions are limited in terms of deployment costs, identification accuracy, or usability. We propose SenseTribute , a novel occupant identification solution that makes use of existing and prevalent on-object sensors that are originally designed to monitor the status of objects to which they are attached. SenseTribute extracts richer information content from such on-object sensors and analyzes the data to accurately identify the person interacting with the objects. This approach is based on the physical phenomenon that different occupants interact with objects in different ways. Moreover, SenseTribute may not rely on users’ true identities, so the approach works even without labeled training data. However, resolution of information from a single on-object sensor may not be sufficient to differentiate occupants, which may lead to errors in identification. To overcome this problem, SenseTribute operates over a sequence of events within a user activity, leveraging recent work on activity segmentation. We evaluate SenseTribute using real-world experiments by deploying sensors on five distinct objects in a kitchen and inviting participants to interact with the objects. We demonstrate that SenseTribute can correctly identify occupants in 96% of trials without labeled training data, while per-sensor identification yields only 74% accuracy even with training data.",

    "abstract": "We explore the advantages of using Erasure Codes (ECs) in a very challenging sensor networking scenario, namely, monitoring and tracking bats in the wild. The mobile bat nodes collect contact information that needs to be transmitted to stationary base stations whenever they are in communication range. We are particularly interested in improving the overall communication reliability of the wireless communication. The mobile nodes are capable of storing a few 100kB of data and to exchange contact information in aggregated form. Due to the continuous flight of the bats and the forest environment, the wireless channel quality varies quickly and, thus, the communication is in general assumed to be highly unreliable. Given the very strict energy constraints of the mobile node and the inherently asymmetric channels, conventional techniques such as full data replication or Automatic Repeat Request to improve the communication reliability are prohibitive. In this work, we investigate the tradeoff between reliability achieved and the cost in form of additional transmissions, that is, the additional energy costs. Our energy measurements on a real platform combined with larger-scale simulation of the wireless communication clearly indicate the advantages of using ECs in our scenario. The results are also applicable in other configurations when unreliable communication channels meet tight energy budgets.",

Conventional designs of indoor navigation systems depend on either infrastructures or indoor floor maps. This article presents CloudNavi, a ubiquitous indoor navigation solution, which relies on the point clouds acquired by the 3D camera embedded in a mobile device. Particularly, CloudNavi first efficiently infers the walking trace of each user from captured point clouds and inertial data. Many shared walking traces and associated point clouds are combined to generate the point cloud traces, which are then used to generate a 3D path-map. Accordingly, CloudNavi can accurately estimate the location of a user by fusing point clouds and inertial data using a particle filter algorithm and then guiding the user to its destination from its current location. Extensive experiments are conducted on office building and shopping mall datasets. Experimental results indicate that CloudNavi exhibits outstanding navigation performance in both office buildings and shopping malls and obtains around 34% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art method.",

A WSN needs to be not only energy efficient but also secure. Various attacks may make data aggregation unsecure. We investigate the reliable and secure end-to-end data aggregation problem considering selective forwarding attacks and modification attacks in homogeneous WSNs, and propose two data aggregation approaches. Our approaches, namely Sign-Share and Sham-Share, use secret sharing and signatures to allow aggregators to aggregate the data without understanding the contents of messages and the base station to verify the aggregated data and retrieve the raw data from the aggregated data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lightweight en-routing malicious node detection in concealed data aggregation. We have performed an extensive simulation to compare our approaches and the two state-of-the-art approaches PIP and RCDA-HOMO. The simulation results show that both Sign-Share and Sham-Share consume a reasonable amount of time in processing and aggregating the data. The simulation results show that our first approach achieved an average network lifetime of 102.33% over PIP and average aggregation energy consumption of 74.93%. In addition, it achieved an average aggregation processing time and sensor data processing time of 95.4% and 90.34% over PIP and 98.7% and 92.07% over RCDA-HOMO, respectively, and it achieved an average network delay of 71.95% over PIP.

We show through actual design, implementation, and experiments that a multihop wireless network can achieve better throughput and routing stability when transmission power and routing topology are “jointly and adaptively” controlled. Our experiments show that the predominant “fixed and uniform” transmission power strategy with “link quality and hop distance”–based routing topology construction (i.e., RPL) loses significant bandwidth due to hidden terminal and load imbalance problems. We design an adaptive and distributed control mechanism for transmission power and routing topology, named PC-RPL , on top of the standard RPL routing protocol for hidden terminal mitigation and load balancing. We implement PC-RPL on real embedded devices and evaluate its performance on a 49-node multihop testbed. PC-RPL reduces total end-to-end packet losses by approximately sevenfold without increasing hop distance compared to RPL with the highest transmission power, resulting in 17% improvement in aggregate bandwidth and 64% improvement for the worst-case node by successfully alleviating both hidden terminal and load imbalance problems.",

The increasing availability of servers that can tolerate higher temperatures and RH due to the regulatory bodies’ prompts to raise DC temperature setpoints sheds light upon the feasibility of air free-cooled DCs in the tropics. However, due to the complex psychrometric dynamics, operating the air free-cooled DC in the tropics generally requires adaptive control of supply air condition to maintain the computing performance and reliability of the servers. This article studies the problem of controlling the supply air temperature and RH in a free-cooled tropical DC below certain thresholds. To achieve the goal, we formulate the control problem as Markov decision processes and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the control policy that minimizes the cooling energy while satisfying the requirements on the supply air temperature and RH. We also develop a constrained DRL solution for performance improvements. Extensive evaluation based on real data traces collected from an air free-cooled testbed and comparisons among the unconstrained and constrained DRL approaches as well as two other baseline approaches show the superior performance of our proposed solutions.",

Specifically, there exists a disparity between the low payment a requester would like to make and the high reward a user would like to receive. In this work, we address this issue by designing a group-buying-based online incentive mechanism, which contains two stages: In Stage I, a price learning algorithm is designed to select winning tasks for each group of sensing tasks and obtain a competitive total budget for recruiting users. In Stage II, an online auction is conducted between group agents and online users before a given recruitment deadline.

However, with the expanding scale of networking, the failure of some nodes in the network severely affects the communication capacity of IoT applications. Therefore, researchers pay attention to improving communication capacity caused by network failures for applications that require high quality of services (QoS). Furthermore, the robustness of network topology is an important metric to measure the network communication capacity and the ability to resist the cyber-attacks induced by some failed nodes. While some algorithms have been proposed to enhance the robustness of IoT topologies, they are characterized by large computation overhead, and lacking a lightweight topology optimization model. To address this problem, we first propose a novel robustness optimization using evolution learning (ROEL) with a neural network. ROEL dynamically optimizes the IoT topology and intelligently prospects the robust degree in the process of evolutionary optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that ROEL can represent the evolutionary process of IoT topologies, and the prediction accuracy of network robustness is satisfactory with a small error ratio. Our algorithm has a better tolerance capacity in terms of resistance to random attacks and malicious attacks compared with other algorithms.",

In particular, we are interested in assigning the sensing radius r and communication radius R to minimize the time required and the energy consumption of transportation cost for sensors to provide the desired k 1 -coverage with k 2 -connectivity.

However, due to the rapid development of sensor technology in recent years, a sensor is allowed to have multiple sensing capabilities, that is, it can generate and collect different types of data. Because different types of data have different meanings and required aggregation functions, only the data that belong to the same type are allowed to be aggregated. In addition, due to the interference of the environment or noise, the links in the WSNs are often not bidirectional. This motivates us to study the problem of using minimum latency scheduling to aggregate and report data to the sink without data collision in multiple-data-type WSNs having unidirectional links, which is shown to be NP-hard in the article.

The proposed method generates a binary sample, which is used to compute a test statistic that is further used against two thresholds to decide among three alternatives. The performance of the suggested method is examined using an IEEE standard test system. The results illustrated the acceptable performance of the proposed methodology in detection of DIAs.

    "abstract": "The agriculture is the backbone of economic system, and it plays an essential part in the survival of a nation’s prosperity. In addition to providing raw materials and food, it also offers numerous employment opportunities. Consequently, agriculture necessitates modern technology to increase productivity. In these circumstances, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are used to detect climatic parameters like light, humidity, carbon dioxide, acidity, soil moisture, and temperature in an agricultural field. However, the research that is being done at the moment is unable to circumvent the issue that safety and effectiveness cannot coexist. Several studies employ time-consuming cryptographic security structures, whereas the majority of lightweight systems are designed without reviewing certain security aspects like resistance to ephemeral secret leakage (ESL) attacks, perfect forward secrecy, and so on. According to our opinion, this issue may be overcome through the use of lightweight cryptographic primitives, paying particular attention to protocol weaknesses, and keeping in mind the ever-changing security needs of individuals. We present an extensive lightweight three-factor authentication protocol with diverse security criteria, along with the adaptive privacy preservation, that is suited for user-friendly situation in the WSN enviroment. This is accomplished by removing all extraneous cryptographic structures. It has been illustrated that proposed protocol is much better in terms of the privacy and security aspects via the usage of security aspects, proof of the real-or-random (ROR) model, protocols of internet security, and applications that are subjected to experimental validation utilizing automated validation. and comparison with other protocols’ security aspects. The performance analysis shows how superior our proposed protocol is to other competing protocols in terms of communication and computational overheads, with respective efficiencies of 53% and 39%. Moreover, using the ROR model reveals that this study has benefits in performance compared with other competing research.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm, which differs from traditional distributed learning in two main aspects: the systems heterogeneity, meaning that clients participating in training have significant differences in systems performance including CPU frequency, dataset size, and transmission power, and the statistical heterogeneity, indicating that the data distribution among clients exhibits Non-Independent Identical Distribution. Therefore, the random selection of clients will significantly reduce the training efficiency of FL. In this article, we propose a client selection mechanism considering both systems and statistical heterogeneity, which aims to improve the time-to-accuracy performance by trading off the impact of systems performance differences and data distribution differences among the clients on training efficiency. First, client selection is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem that jointly optimizes systems and statistical performance. Then, we generalize it to a submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraint, and propose the Iterative Greedy with Partial Enumeration (IGPE) algorithm to greedily select the suitable clients. Then, the approximation ratio of IGPE is analyzed theoretically. Extensive experiments verify that the time-to-accuracy performance of the IGPE algorithm outperforms other compared algorithms in a variety of heterogeneous environments.",

However, applying machine learning algorithms to sensing devices presents substantial challenges due to resource constraints and privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution allowing for training models in a distributed manner while preserving data privacy on client devices. We contribute SAFI , a semi-asynchronous FL approach based on clustering to achieve a novel in-cluster synchronous and out-cluster asynchronous FL training mode. Specifically, we propose a three-tier architecture to enable IoT data processing on edge devices and design a clustering selection module to effectively group heterogeneous edge devices based on their processing capacities. The performance of SAFI has been extensively evaluated through experiments conducted on a real-world testbed. As the heterogeneity of edge devices increases, SAFI surpasses the baselines in terms of the convergence time, achieving a speedup of approximately × 3 when the heterogeneity ratio is 7:1. Moreover, SAFI demonstrates favorable performance in non-independent and identically distributed settings and requires lower communication cost compared to FedAsync. Notably, SAFI is the first Java-implemented FL approach and holds significant promise to serve as an efficient FL algorithm in IoT environments.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a remarkable proliferation of applications in smart cities. Crowd analysis is a crucial subject, and it incorporates two subtasks in smart city systems, i.e. , crowd counting and crowd localization. Nevertheless, the presence of adverse intrinsic factors, i.e. , scale variation and background noise severely degrades the performance of counting and localization. Although great efforts have been made on separate research on counting and localization, few works are capable of performing both tasks at the same time. To this aim, the scale attentive aggregation network (SA 2 Net) is proposed to solve the problems of scale variation and background noise in crowd counting and localization tasks synchronously. Specifically, the SA 2 Net has two vital modules, namely multiscale feature aggregator (MFA) module and background noise suppressor (BNS) module. The MFA module is designed in a four-pathway structure, and it aggregates the multiscale feature so as to facilitate the correlation between different scales. The BNS module utilizes the contextual information between the input keys matrix and self-attention matrix to suppress the background noise. Furthermore, a global consistency loss combined with the Euclidean loss is utilized to optimize the network in counting and localization tasks. Extensive experimental results prove that the SA 2 Net outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors both subjectively and objectively.",

However, parallel DCML frameworks require resource-constrained devices to update the entire Deep Neural Network (DNN) models and are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks. Concurrently, the serial DCML frameworks suffer from training efficiency problems due to their serial training nature. In this paper, we propose a Model Pruning-enabled Federated Split Learning framework (MP-FSL) to reduce resource consumption with a secure and efficient training scheme. Specifically, MP-FSL compresses DNN models by adaptive channel pruning and splits each compressed model into two parts that are assigned to the client and the server. Meanwhile, MP-FSL adopts a novel aggregation algorithm to aggregate the pruned heterogeneous models. We implement MP-FSL with a real FL platform to evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that MP-FSL outperforms the state-of-the-art frameworks in model accuracy by up to 1.35%, while concurrently reducing storage and computational resource consumption by up to 32.2% and 26.73%, respectively. These results demonstrate that MP-FSL is a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by DCML, with superior performance in both reduced resource consumption and enhanced model performance.",

Since the sensors themselves are important and critical objects in the network, a natural question is whether they need certain level of protection, so as to resist the attacks targeting on them directly. If this is necessary, then who should provide this protection, and how it can be done? We refer to the above problem as self-protection , as we believe the sensors themselves are the best (and often the only) candidates to provide such protection. In this article, we for the first time present a formal study on the self-protection problems in wireless sensor networks. We show that, if we simply focus on enhancing the quality of field or object covering, the sensors might not necessarily be self-protected, which in turn makes the system extremely vulnerable. We then investigate different forms of self-protections, and show that the problems are generally NP-complete. We develop efficient approximation algorithms for centrally controlled sensors. We further extend the algorithms to fully distributed implementation, and introduce a smart sleep-scheduling algorithm that minimizes the energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "Achieving energy efficiency to prolong the network lifetime is an important design criterion for wireless sensor networks. In this article, we propose a novel approach that exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless medium for energy conservation in spatially correlated wireless sensor networks. Since wireless transmission is inherently broadcast, when one sensor node transmits, other nodes in its coverage area can receive the transmitted data. When data collected by different sensors are correlated, each sensor can utilize the data it overhears from other sensors to compress its own data and conserve energy in its own transmissions. We apply this idea to a class of cluster-based wireless sensor networks in which each sensing node transmits collected data directly to its cluster head using time division multiple access (TDMA). We formulate the problem in which sensors in each cluster collaborate their transmitting, receiving, and compressing activities to optimize their lifetimes. We show that this lifetime optimization problem can be solved by a sequence of linear programming problems. We also propose a heuristic scheme which has low complexity and achieves near optimal performance. Important characteristics of wireless sensor networks such as node startup cost and packet loss due to transmission errors are also considered. Numerical results show that by exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium, our control schemes achieve significant improvement in the sensors' lifetimes.",

This sensor model is often trained offline, incurring a large amount of calibration effort. In this article, we address the problem using a goal-based segmentation approach, in which we automatically segment the low-level user traces that are obtained cheaply by collecting the signal sequences as a user moves in wireless environments. From the traces we discover primitive signal segments that can be used for building a probabilistic activity model to recognize goals directly. A major advantage of our algorithm is that it can reduce a significant amount of human effort in calibrating the sensor data while still achieving comparable recognition accuracy. We present our theoretical framework for activity recognition, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach using the data collected in an indoor wireless environment.",

In many such applications, the environmental data are continuously sensed, and data collection by a server is only performed occasionally. Hence, the sensor nodes have to temporarily store the data, and provide easy and on-hand access for the most updated data when the server approaches. Given the expensive server-to-sensor communications, the large amount of sensors and the limited storage space at each tiny sensor, continuous data collection becomes a challenging problem. In this article, we present partial network coding (PNC) as a generic tool for these applications. PNC generalizes the existing network coding (NC) paradigm, an elegant solution for ubiquitous data distribution and collection. Yet PNC allows efficient storage replacement for continuous data, which is a deficiency of the conventional NC. We prove that the performance of PNC is quite close to NC, except for a sub-linear overhead on storage and communications. We then address a set of practical concerns toward PNC-based continuous data collection in sensor networks. Its feasibility and superiority are further demonstrated through simulation results.",

The issues underlying this question relate to the fidelity of query results and lifetime of the network. To maximize both, we propose a novel technique called asynchronous in-network prediction incorporating two computationally efficient methods for in-network prediction of partial aggregate values. These values are propagated via a tree whose construction is cognizant of (a) the coherency requirements associated with the queries, (b) the remaining energy at the sensors, and (c) the communication and message processing delays. Finally, we exploit in-network filtering and in-network aggregation to reduce the energy consumption of the nodes in the network. Experimental results over real world data support our claim that, for aggregate queries with associated coherency requirements, a prediction-based, asynchronous scheme provides higher quality results for a longer amount of time than a synchronous scheme. Also, whereas aggregate dissemination techniques proposed so far for sensor networks appear to have to trade-off quality of data for energy efficiency, we demonstrate that this is not always necessary.",

We study both point-based and area-based methods that employ received signal strength for localization, and propose several performance metrics that quantify the estimator's precision, bias, and error, including Hölder metrics, which quantify the variability in position space for a given variability in signal strength space. We then conduct a trace-driven evaluation of a set of representative algorithms, where we measured their performance as we applied attacks on real data from two different buildings. We found the median error degraded gracefully, with a linear response as a function of the attack strength. We also found that area-based algorithms experienced a decrease and a spatial-shift in the returned area under attack, implying that precision increases though bias is introduced for these schemes. Additionally, we observed similar values for the average Hölder metric across most of the algorithms, thereby providing strong experimental evidence that nearly all the algorithms have similar average responses to signal strength attacks with the exception of the Bayesian Networks algorithm.",

The periodic PoI sensor schedule happens in two broad contexts. In the case of static sensors, a sensor monitoring a PoI may be periodically turned off to conserve energy, thereby extending the lifetime of the monitoring until the sensor can be recharged or replaced. In the case of mobile sensors, a sensor may move between the PoIs in a repeating visit schedule. In this case, the PoIs may vary in importance, and the scheduling objective is to distribute the sensor's coverage time in proportion to the importance levels of the PoIs.

Once moved, the tag uses inertial sensor-based dead reckoning to estimate position changes, but to reduce integration errors, the relative position is reset whenever the sensors indicate the vehicle has stopped. The sequence of movements, stops, and turns are logged in compact form and eventually transferred to a server using a cellular modem after both sufficient time has passed (to avoid detection) and RF power is detectable (hinting cellular access may be available). Eventually, the trajectory data are sent to a server which attempts to match a path to the observations. The algorithm uses a Hidden Markov Model of city streets and Viterbi decoding to estimate the most likely path. The proposed design leverages low-power radios and inertial sensors, is immune to intransit cloaking, and supports post hoc path reconstruction.

For lossless data gathering scenarios, on the other hand, the sampling rate is lowered without sacrificing critical knowledge required for signal reconstruction. As lower sampling rates lead to smaller energy consumption for processing and transmitting the collected sensory data, the proposed asynchronous sampling strategies are capable of achieving a better trade-off between the lifetime of the network and the quality of collected information.

In this article, we consider the anchor-free localization problem in sensor networks that report possibly noisy range information and angular information about the relative order of each sensor's neighbors. Previously proposed techniques seem to successfully reconstruct the original positions of the nodes for relatively small networks with nodes distributed in simple regions. However, these techniques do not scale well with network size and yield poor results with nonconvex or nonsimple underlying topology. Moreover, the distributed nature of the problem makes some of the centralized techniques inapplicable in distributed settings. To address these problems we describe a multiscale dead-reckoning (MSDR) algorithm that scales well for large networks, can reconstruct complex underlying topologies, and is resilient to noise. The MSDR algorithm takes its roots from classic force-directed graph layout computation techniques. These techniques are augmented with a multiscale extension to handle the scalability issue and with a dead-reckoning extension to overcome the problems arising with nonsimple topologies. Furthermore, we show that the distributed version of the MSDR algorithm performs as well as, if not better than, its centralized counterpart, as shown by the quality of the layout, measured in terms of the accuracy of the computed pairwise distances between sensors in the network.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks can often be viewed in terms of a uniform deployment of a large number of nodes in a region of Euclidean space. Following deployment, the nodes self-organize into a mesh topology with a key aspect being self-localization . Having obtained a mesh topology in a dense, homogeneous deployment, a frequently used approximation is to take the hop distance between nodes to be proportional to the Euclidean distance between them. In this work, we analyze this approximation through two complementary analyses. We assume that the mesh topology is a random geometric graph on the nodes; and that some nodes are designated as anchors with known locations. First, we obtain high probability bounds on the Euclidean distances of all nodes that are h hops away from a fixed anchor node. In the second analysis, we provide a heuristic argument that leads to a direct approximation for the density function of the Euclidean distance between two nodes that are separated by a hop distance h . This approximation is shown, through simulation, to very closely match the true density function. Localization algorithms that draw upon the preceding analyses are then proposed and shown to perform better than some of the well-known algorithms present in the literature. Belief-propagation-based message-passing is then used to further enhance the performance of the proposed localization algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first usage of message-passing for hop-count-based self-localization.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a sensor network approach to tracking a single object in the presence of static and moving occluders using a network of cameras. To conserve communication bandwidth and energy, we combine a task-driven approach with camera subset selection. In the task-driven approach, each camera first performs simple local processing to detect the horizontal position of the object in the image. This information is then sent to a cluster head to track the object. We assume the locations of the static occluders to be known, but only prior statistics on the positions of the moving occluders are available. A noisy perspective camera measurement model is introduced, where occlusions are captured through occlusion indicator functions. An auxiliary particle filter that incorporates the occluder information is used to track the object. The camera subset selection algorithm uses the minimum mean square error of the best linear estimate of the object position as a metric, and tracking is performed using only the selected subset of cameras. Using simulations and preselected subsets of cameras, we investigate (i) the dependency of the tracker performance on the accuracy of the moving occluder priors, (ii) the trade-off between the number of cameras and the occluder prior accuracy required to achieve a prescribed tracker performance, and (iii) the importance of having occluder priors to the tracker performance as the number of occluders increases. We find that computing moving occluder priors may not be worthwhile, unless it can be obtained cheaply and to high accuracy. We also investigate the effect of dynamically selecting the subset of camera nodes used in tracking on the tracking performance. We show through simulations that a greedy selection algorithm performs close to the brute-force method and outperforms other heuristics, and the performance achieved by greedily selecting a small fraction of the cameras is close to that of using all the cameras.",

Although solutions for WSNs with battery-operated nodes have been proposed for this problem, no attention has been given to networks whose nodes have energy-harvesting capabilities and are powered in part by uncontrollable environmental sources, which impose quite a different energy model. In this article we address this problem by providing both an analytical model and a distributed heuristic, called EN-MASSE, specifically tailored for energy-harvesting mission-centric WSNs. To assess the performance of our proposed solution we have interfaced TelosB nodes with solar cells and performed extensive experiments to derive models and traces of solar energy acquisition. We use such real-life traces in our simulations. A comparative performance evaluation between EN-MASSE and other schemes previously proposed in the literature has shown that our solution significantly outperforms existing energy-harvesting-unaware mission assignment schemes. Moreover, using our analytical model as a benchmark, we also show that the profit earned by EN-MASSE is close to the optimum. Finally, we have implemented our proposed solution in TinyOS and experimentally validated its performance, showing the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "A novel energy-balanced task-scheduling method is proposed that extends the lifespan of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for collaborative target tracking using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm. It is shown that the tracking accuracy is approximately proportional to the number of active sensor nodes participating in collaborative tracking. Excessive sensor nodes thus may be put to sleep mode to conserve energy provided there are a sufficient number of active sensor nodes. It is then shown that the lifespan of a WSN is dictated by the distribution of residue energy of sensor nodes. Specifically, we have shown that an energy-balanced WSN is likely to maximize its lifespan. As such, at each step of the tracking task, the head node must judiciously select active nodes from all sensors within the sensing range to minimize residue energy variations (energy balanced) while achieving desired tracking accuracy. This is formulated as a subset selection problem, which is shown to have a complexity that is NP-hard. Several energy-balanced scheduling for tracking (EBaST) heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve this problem with polynomial execution complexities. Extensive simulations have been conducted to compare EBaST against some state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms. It is observed that EBaST is more capable of significantly extending the WSNs lifespan than competing algorithms while delivering comparable or better tracking accuracy.",

Second, the similarity preserving method within R3 (R3sim) optimizes the binary code format for achieving a large similarity with a small metadata overhead.

The UAV therefore acts as a information-seeking data mule, not only providing connectivity, but also making Bayesian inferences from the data gathered in order to guide its future actions.

Since the delay bounds of real-time flows are extremely important, the end-to-end delay bound for a single flow is derived based on the Network Calculus theory.

In our previous work (Jia et al. 2017a), we presented a privacy-preserving data publishing framework (referred to as PAD hereinafter), which can guarantee k-anonymity while achieving better data utility than traditional anonymization techniques. PAD learns the information of interest to data users or features from their interactions with the data publishing system and then customizes data publishing processes to the intended use of data. However, our previous work is only applicable to the case where the desired features are linear in the original data record. In this article, we extend PAD to nonlinear features.

In this article, we propose and evaluate a new approach for secret key extraction where multiple sensors collaborate in exchanging probe packets and collecting channel measurements. Essentially, measurements from multiple channels have a substantially higher differential entropy compared to the measurements from a single channel, thereby resulting in more randomness in the information source for key extraction, and this in turn produces stronger secret keys. We also explore the fundamental trade-off between the quadratic increase in the number of measurements of the channels due to multiple nodes per group versus a linear reduction in the sampling rate and a linear increase in the time gap between bidirectional measurements. To experimentally evaluate collaborative secret key extraction in wireless sensor networks, we first build a simple yet flexible testbed with multiple TelosB sensor nodes. Next, we perform large-scale experiments with different configurations of collaboration. Our experiments show that in comparison to the 1 × 1 configuration, collaboration among sensor nodes significantly increases the secret bit extraction per second, per probe, as well as per millijoule of transmission energy. In addition, we show that the collaborating nodes can improve the performance further when they exploit both space and frequency diversities.",

However, this flexibility comes with stricter legal regulations such as maximum radio activity time per 1-hour period. Under such constraints it is difficult to provide service guarantees, which is quite paradoxical when devices are deployed for surveillance systems. The approach we propose allows devices to go “exceptionally” beyond the activity time limitation by borrowing time from other devices. The mechanism is not intended to be used on a regular basis, where a device is commissioned to always report data at a rate that makes it consuming more than the allowed duty-cycle limitation, but to offer a “last chance” solution for providing better surveillance service guarantees while globally satisfying duty-cycle regulations. The proposition has been implemented on our long-range image sensor platform, and preliminary experiments show that it can maintain the system’s consistency and keep the number of control messages small while being capable of handling sleep-wakeup behavior and dynamic insertion of new devices. Although initially targeted for image sensors, the proposition can also be deployed to increase the quality of service of traditional sensors by guaranteeing that important messages can be sent despite the duty-cycle regulation limit.",

In particular, the area division algorithm is not only fully distributed but also provably achieves an approximation ratio of (1 − ϵ). Further, we conduct extensive simulations and build a field testbed to verify our theoretical findings. Our simulation results show that the approximation ratios of the proposed algorithms hold; the Primal-Dual and area division algorithms have comparable performance of the optimal results and outperform baseline algorithms obviously.",

To our best knowledge, this is the first piece of work using geomagnetism for smartphone localization without the need of pedometer or user walking model. Magil is applicable to any open or complex indoor environment. In the offline phase, Magil collects and stores geomagnetic fingerprints while surveyors walk indoors. In the online phase, it employs a fast algorithm to match the geomagnetic variation of the target with the stored fingerprints. Given closely matched segments, Magil constructs user trajectory efficiently with a modified shortest path formulation by selecting and connecting these matched segments.

Unfortunately, performance of current network protocols can vary significantly because of various interferences and environmental changes. Current protocols estimate link quality based on the reception of probe packets over a short time period. This method is neither efficient nor accurate enough to capture the dramatic variations of link quality. Therefore, we propose a link metric called competence that characterizes links over a longer period of time. We combine competence with current short-term estimations in routing algorithm designs. To further improve network performance, we have designed a distributed route maintenance framework based on feedback control solutions. This framework allows every link along an end-to-end (E2E) path to adjust its link protocol parameters, such as transmission power and number of retransmissions, to ensure specified E2E reliability and latency under dynamic link qualities. Our solutions are evaluated in both extensive simulations and real system experiments. In real system evaluations with 48 T-Motes, our overall solution improves E2E packet delivery ratio over existing solutions by up to 40% while reducing transmission energy consumption by up to 22%. Importantly, our solution also achieves more stable and better transient performance than current approaches.",

    "abstract": "We present a robust, dynamic scheme for the automatic self-deployment and relocation of mobile sensor nodes (e.g., unmanned ground vehicles, robots) around areas where phenomena take place. Our scheme aims (i) to sense environmental contextual parameters and accurately capture the spatiotemporal evolution of a certain phenomenon (e.g., fire, air contamination) and (ii) to fully automate the deployment process by letting nodes relocate, self-organize (and self-reorganize), and optimally cover the focus area. Our intention is to “opportunistically” modify the previous placement of nodes to attain high-quality phenomenon monitoring. The required intelligence is fully distributed within the mobile sensor network so the deployment algorithm is executed incrementally by different nodes. The presented algorithm adopts the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, which yields very promising results as reported in the article (performance assessment). Our findings show that the proposed algorithm captures a certain phenomenon with very high accuracy while maintaining the networkwide energy expenditure at low levels. Random occurrences of similar phenomena put stress upon the algorithm which manages to react promptly and efficiently manage the available sensing resources in the broader setting.",

    "abstract": "Resource constraints, unattended operating environments, and communication phenomena make Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) susceptible to operational failures and security attacks. However, applications often impose stringent requirements on data reliability and service availability, due to the deployment of sensor networks in various critical infrastructures. Given the failure- and attack-prone nature of sensor networks, enabling sensor networks to continuously provide their services as well as to effectively recover from attacks is a crucial requirement. We present Kinesis, a security incident response system designed to keep WSNs functional despite anomalies or attacks and to recover from attacks without significant interruption. Kinesis is quick and effective in responding to incidents, distributed in nature, dynamic in selecting response actions based on the context, and lightweight in terms of response policy specification, communication, and energy overhead. A per-node single timer-based distributed strategy to select the most effective response executor in a neighborhood makes the system simple and scalable, while achieving load balancing and redundant action optimization. We implement Kinesis in TinyOS and measure its performance for various application and network layer incidents. Extensive TOSSIM simulations and testbed experiments show that Kinesis successfully counteracts anomalies/attacks and behaves consistently under various attack scenarios and rates.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Harmonium , a novel ultra wideband (UWB) RF localization architecture that achieves decimeter-scale accuracy indoors. Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates. Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive, lightweight, and FCC-compliant UWB transmitter or tag , fixed infrastructure anchors with known locations, and centralized processing that calculates the tag’s position. Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that rejects narrowband interferers and extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of traditional UWB approaches. In a complex indoor environment, 90% of position estimates obtained with Harmonium exhibit less than 31 cm of error with an average of 9 cm of inter-sample noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e., through-wall), 90% of position error is less than 42 cm. The tag draws 75 mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9 mJ per location fix at the 19 Hz update rate. Tags weigh 3 g and cost $4.50 USD at modest volumes. Furthermore, VLSI-based design concepts are identified for a simple, low-power realization of the Harmonium tag to offer a roadmap for the realization of Harmonium concepts in future integrated systems. Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors, devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture systems.",

    "abstract": "Due to limited energy supply of Internet of Things (Zhao et al. 2018) (IoT) devices, asynchronous duty cycle radio management is widely adopted to save energy. Since the sleep schedules of nodes are unsynchronized, a sender has to repeatedly send frames to coordinate with its receiver or keep sleeping until the receiver’s wake-up time will come according to receiver’s sleep-wake schedule. In such contexts, opportunistic forwarding, which takes the earliest forwarding opportunity instead of a deterministic forwarder, shows great advantage in utilizing channel resource for duty-cycled IoT networks. The multiple forwarding choices with temporal and spatial diversity increase the chance of collision tolerance in opportunistic forwarding, potentially enhancing the overall performance of duty-cycled multi-hop networks. However, since the current channel contention mechanisms mainly focus on collision avoidance, it is too conservative to exploit concurrency. To address this problem, in this article, we propose COF to fully exploit the potential Concurrency for Opportunistic Forwarding in duty-cycled IoT networks. COF achieves concurrent transmission by: (i) measuring conditional link quality under the interference of on-going transmissions, and then (ii) further modeling the benefit of potential concurrency opportunities. According to the expected benefit of concurrency, COF decides whether or not to transmit in concurrent way. COF also adopts concurrency flag and signal features to avoid data collision caused by disordered concurrent transmissions and enhance the accuracy of conditional link quality estimation. COF can be easily integrated into the conventional unsynchronized and duty-cycled protocols. We have implemented COF and evaluated its performance on a 40-node testbed. The results show that COF can effectively exploit potential concurrency in opportunistic forwarding and COF outperforms the state-of-art protocols under diverse traffic load and network density.",

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of smart devices, children can be easily exposed to violent or adult-only content on the Internet. Without any precaution, the premature and unsupervised use of smart devices can be harmful to both children and their parents. Thus, it is critical to employ parent patrol mechanisms such that children are restricted to child-friendly content only. A successful parent patrol strategy has to be user friendly and privacy aware. The apps that require explicit actions from parents are not effective because a parent may forget to enable them, and the ones that use built-in cameras or microphones to detect child users may impose privacy violations. In this article, we propose iCare, a system that can identify child users automatically and seamlessly when users operate smartphones. In particular, iCare investigates the intrinsic differences of screen-touch patterns between child and adult users from the aspect of physiological maturity. We discover that one’s touch behaviors are related to his or her age. Thus, iCare records the touch behaviors and extracts hand geometry, finger dexterity, and hand stability features that capture the age information. We conduct experiments on 100 people including 62 children (3 to 17 years old) and 38 adults (18 to 59 years old). Results show that iCare can achieve 96.6% accuracy for child identification using only a single swipe on the screen, and the accuracy becomes 98.3% with three consecutive swipes.",

PCube leverages the reception diversities of multiple receiving antennas of a gateway and scales the concurrent transmissions of a large number of LoRa nodes, even exceeding the number of receiving antennas at a gateway.

Results demonstrate that PCube can substantially outperform state-of-the-art works in terms of aggregated throughput by 4.9× and the number of concurrent nodes by up to 5×.

In this article, we propose Akte-Liquid, which leverages the speaker on smartphones to transmit acoustic signals, and the microphone on smartphones to receive reflected signals to identify liquid types and analyze the liquid concentration. Our work arises from the acoustic intrinsic impedance property of liquids, in that different liquids have different intrinsic impedance, causing reflected acoustic signals of liquids to differ. Then, we discover that the amplitude-frequency feature of reflected signals may be utilized to represent the liquid feature. With this insight, we propose new mechanisms to eliminate the interference caused by hardware and multi-path propagation effects to extract the liquid features. In addition, we design a new Siamese network-based structure with a specific training sample selection mechanism to reconstruct the extracted feature to container-irrelevant features. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that Akte-Liquid is able to distinguish 20 types of liquids at a higher accuracy, and to identify food additives and measure protein concentration in the artificial urine with a 92.3% accuracy under 1 mg/100 mL as well.",

However, the service offloading from health monitoring units (HMUs) to edge servers generates additional energy consumption. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI), which has developed rapidly in recent years, has proved effective in some resource allocation applications. Taking both energy consumption and delay into account, we propose an energy-aware service offloading algorithm under an end-edge-cloud collaborative IoMT system with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-critic (A3C), named ECAC. Technically, ECAC uses the structural similarity between the natural distributed IoMT system and A3C, whose parameters are asynchronously updated. Besides, due to the typical delay-sensitivity mechanism and time-energy correction, ECAC can adjust dynamically to the diverse service types and system requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of ECAC for IoMT is proved on real data.",

We use a charging pile to recharge UAVs. The problem is scheduling UAVs to cover the barrier, and, for any scheduling strategy, estimating the minimum number of UAVs needed to cover the barrier forever. We propose breaking the barrier into subsegments so that each subsegment can be monitored by a single UAV. We then analyze two scheduling strategies, where the first one is simple to implement and the second one requires fewer UAVs. The first strategy divides UAVs into groups with each group covering a subsegment. For this strategy, we derive a closed-form formula for the minimum number of UAVs. In the case of insufficient UAVs, we give a recursive function to compute the exact coverage time and give a dynamic-programming algorithm to allocate UAVs to subsegments to maximize the overall coverage time. The second strategy schedules all UAVs dynamically. We prove a lower and an upper bound on the minimum number of UAVs. We implement a prototype system to verify the proposed coverage model and perform simulations to investigate the performance.",

In this article, we investigate the k -coverage problem in planar (or two-dimensional) WSNs, where each point in a field of interest (FoI) is covered by at least k sensors simultaneously, where k ≥ 1. Our contribution is four-fold: First, we determine the optimal planar convex tile that maximizes the usage of the sensors’ sensing range. Then, we propose a few sensor placement strategies based on the degree of coverage k using a hexagonal tiling-based approach. In addition, we compute the sensor density (i.e., number of sensors per unit area) for each of the above sensor placement strategies. Second, we propose a generalized one using irregular hexagons, which are denoted by IRH(r/n) , where r stands for the radius of the sensors’ sensing range and n ≥ 2 is a natural number. Also, we derive the corresponding sensor density. Moreover, we prove that IRH(r/n) are capable of tiling the Euclidean plane using a mathematical induction proof. Third, we compute the relationship between the sensing range r of the sensors and their communication range R for the above sensor placement strategies.

While remote monitoring of some parameters (heart rate) is approaching clinical levels of precision, others remain challenging (blood pressure). We investigated the feasibility of estimating blood pressure (BP) via pulse transit time (PTT) in a novel remote single-site manner, using a modified RGB camera. A narrow-band triple band-pass filter allowed us to measure the PTT between different skin layers, harvesting information from green and near-infrared wavelengths. The filter minimizes the inter-channel influence and band overlap, however, some overlap remains within the filter bands. We further resolve this using a color-channel model and a novel channel-separation method. Using the proposed setup and algorithm, we obtained multi-wavelength (MW) PTTs in an experiment inducing BP changes to 9 subjects. The results showed good absolute Pearson’s correlation coefficient between both MW PTT and systolic BP (R = 0.61, p = 0.08) as well as diastolic BP (R = 0.54, p = 0.05), pointing to feasibility of the proposed novel remote MW BP estimation via PTT.

    "abstract": "Handwritten signature verification has become one of the most important document authentication methods that are widely used in the financial, legal, and administrative sectors. Compared with offline methods based on static signature images, online handwritten signature verification methods are more reliable because of the temporary dynamic information (e.g., signing velocity, writing force, stroke order) that alleviates the risk of being forged. However, most existing online handwritten signature verification solutions are reliant on specific signing devices (e.g., customized pens or writing pads) and require extensive data collection during the registration phase, resulting in poor adaptability and applicability for new users. In this article, we propose mmSign, a millimeter wave (mmWave)–based online handwritten signature verification system, which enables accurate sensing of the user’s hand movements when signing through the superior sensing capability of mmWave. mmSign extracts the time-velocity feature maps from the captured mmWave signals by the carefully designed signal processing algorithms and then exploits a transformer-based verification model for signature verification. In addition, a novel meta-learning strategy with proposed task generation and data augmentation methods is introduced in mmSign to teach the verification model to learn effectively with limited samples, allowing our model to quickly adapt to new users. Extensive experiments show that mmSign is a robust, efficient, and secure handwritten signature verification system, achieving 84.07%, 87.31%, 91.12%, and 96.54% verification accuracy when 1, 3, 5, and 10 labeled signatures are available, respectively, while being resistant to common forgery attacks.",

One of the most promising techniques to mitigate inter-cell interference is beamforming, however, how to coordinate the beamformers in a multicell dynamic network to reach a global optimum is an extremely challenging problem. In this paper, we consider analog beamforming with low-resolution phase shifters, and propose a distributed learning and multicell coordination based energy efficient beamforming approach for multiple-input and single-output (MISO) small cell system. The goal is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the whole system by jointly optimizing the beamformer and transmit power. We perform extensive simulations in both static and dynamic scenarios, and validate the performance of the proposed approach by comparing with baseline and existing schemes.

    "abstract": "Deep learning–based video analytics demands high network bandwidth to ferry the large volume of data when deployed on the cloud. When incorporated at the edge side, only lightweight deep neural network (DNN) models are affordable due to computational constraint. In this article, a cloud–edge collaborative architecture is proposed combining edge-based inference with cloud-assisted continuous learning. Lightweight DNN models are maintained at the edge servers and continuously retrained with a more comprehensive model on the cloud to achieve high video analytics performance while reducing the amount of data transmitted between edge servers and the cloud. The proposed design faces the challenge of constraints of both computation resources at the edge servers and network bandwidth of the edge–cloud links. An accuracy gradient-based resource allocation algorithm is proposed to allocate the limited computation and network resources across different video streams to achieve the maximum overall performance. A prototype system is implemented and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with up to 28.6% absolute mean average precision gain compared with alternative designs.",

However, to date, the extent to which physical layer properties affect the performance of CT has not yet been investigated in detail. This article fills this gap and provides an extensive study on the impact of the physical layer on CT-based solutions using IEEE 802.15.4 and BLE 5. We first highlight through simulation how the impact of errors induced by relative carrier frequency offsets on the performance of CT highly depends on the choice of the underlying physical layer. We then confirm these observations experimentally on real hardware and with varying environmental conditions through an analysis of the bit error distribution across received packets, unveiling possible techniques to effectively handle these errors. We further study the performance of CT-based data collection and dissemination protocols in the presence of RF interference on a large-scale testbed, deriving insights on how the employed physical layer affects their dependability.",

    "abstract": "Application-layer distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks incapacitate systems by using up their resources, causing service interruptions, financial losses, and more. Consequently, advanced deep-learning techniques are used to detect and mitigate these attacks in cloud infrastructures. However, in mobile edge computing (MEC), it becomes economically impractical to equip each node with defensive resources, as these resources may largely remain unused in edge devices. Furthermore, current methods are mainly concentrated on improving the accuracy of DDoS attack detection and saving CPU resources, neglecting the effective allocation of computational power for benign tasks under DDoS attacks. To address these issues, this paper introduces SecEG, a secure and efficient strategy against DDoS attacks for MEC that integrates container-based task isolation with lightweight online anomaly detection on edge nodes. More specifically, a new model is proposed to analyze resource contention dynamics between DDoS attacks and benign tasks. Subsequently, by employing periodic packet sampling and real-time attack intensity predicting, an autoencoder-based method is proposed to detect DDoS attacks. We leverage an efficient scheduling method to optimize the edge resource allocation and the service quality for benign users during DDoS attacks. When executed in the real-world edge environment, our experimental findings validate the efficacy of the proposed SecEG strategy. Compared to conventional methods, the service rate of benign requests increases by 23% under intense DDoS attacks, and the CPU resource is saved up to 35%.",

This paper presents an original approach for monitoring Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) through Internet of Things (IoT) that involves the integration of multiple sensors placed across the distribution network to accurately measure water flow. To enhance energy efficiency for green monitoring and communication process, we harness the power of graph theory and graph signal processing to represent in a tunable and accurate way the water flow and simultaneously minimize the number of IoT sensors communicating those measurements. We propose a graph model where water flow is represented as signal on graph and we introduce an algorithm, named GraphSmart, designed to reconstruct the graph signal when certain measurements are unknown or missing. Our framework is applied on a synthetic realistic environment within the context of LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), an infrastructure and protocol designed for ultra-low-power IoT devices. Our findings show that GraphSmart significantly reduces energy consumption while ensuring precise flow estimation. Our research demonstrates high potential for energy-efficient and accurate water flow monitoring, paving the way to improve the management of WDSs and enabling water operators to address water scarcity challenges.",

    "abstract": "Immersive systems, which offer immersive interactive experiences by tightly coupling the real and virtual worlds, encompassing Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), have undergone rapid development in recent years. The inherent latency issue of immersive systems poses considerable challenges for AR/VR applications that are highly sensitive to delay. To address this challenge, we propose utilizing edge collaboration as an efficient means to schedule AR/VR requests, owing to the inherent ability of edge nodes to seamlessly coordinate within the same geographical region and optimally allocate request resources to minimize latency. However, when it comes to edge nodes across different regions, a significant hurdle emerges. These nodes often lack real-time knowledge about cached resources across other regions, making cross-regional edge collaboration for AR/VR request scheduling an extremely challenging problem. We formally define and prove the NP-hardness of this problem. To tackle this complexity, we introduce a Federated Digital Twin Model Construction (FedDT), which establishes a global digital twin network connecting different edge nodes. This network simulates and reflects the resource status and availability of each edge node in real time. Subsequently, we devise an extended Dijkstra algorithm to determine the shortest path between AR/VR requests and edge nodes, taking into account current network conditions to optimize service delay. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that compared with baseline methods, our proposed solution consistently achieves an average delay reduction of 36.78% across various scenarios, effectively demonstrating its superior performance.",

Instead of organizing objects a priori, it allows humans to search for and locate them as needed. Designed for the following objectives: (i) human-centric operation, (ii) privacy, and (iii) efficient searching of any tagged object, MAX provides location information in a form natural to humans, that is, with reference to identifiable landmarks (such as, “on the dining table”) rather than precise coordinates. In the system, all physical objects—from documents to clothing—can be tagged, users then locate objects using an intuitive search interface. To make searching efficient, MAX adopts a hierarchical architecture consisting of tags (bound to objects), substations (bound to landmarks), and base-stations (bound to localities). Tags can be marked as either public or private, with private tags searchable only by the owner. MAX also provides for privacy of physical spaces. It requires minimal initial configuration, and is robust to reconfiguration of the physical space. We also present a methodology to design energy-optimal and delay-optimal query protocols for a variety of device choices, this optimizes system performance, and affords insight into the appropriate actions for various scenarios. We have implemented a simple prototype of MAX, demonstrating the feasibility of the system for human-centric search over several locations across a wide area. We contend that a MAX-like search system will enable sharing (e.g., books on a college campus) and trading (e.g., buying and selling used books) of physical resources, and will be the engine for a host of new applications.",

In this article, we present a wireless sensor network protocol, Trail, that supports distance-sensitive tracking of mobile objects for in-network subscribers upon demand. Trail achieves a find time that is linear in the distance from a subscriber to an object, via a distributed data structure that is updated only locally when the object moves. Notably, Trail does not partition the network into a hierarchy of clusters and clusterheads, and as a result Trail has lower maintenance costs, is more locally fault tolerant, and it better utilizes the network in terms of load balancing and minimizing the size of the data structure needed for tracking. Moreover, Trail is reliable and energy efficient, despite the network dynamics that are typical of wireless sensor networks. Trail can be refined by tuning certain parameters, thereby yielding a family of protocols that are suited for different application settings such as rate of queries, rate of updates, and network size. We evaluate the performance of Trail by analysis, simulations in a 90 × 90 sensor network, and experiments on 105 Mica2 nodes in the context of a pursuer-evader control application.",

    "abstract": "Broadcast authentication is an important functionality in sensor networks. Energy constraints on sensor nodes and the real-time nature of the broadcasts render many of the existing solutions impractical: previous works focusing primarily on symmetric key schemes have difficulties in achieving real-time authentication. Public Key Cryptography (PKC), however, can satisfy the real-time requirements, and recent trends indicate that public key is becoming feasible for sensor networks. However, PKC operations are still expensive computations. It is impractical to use PKC in the conventional ways for broadcast authentication in sensor networks. To reduce costs, we propose ShortPK , an efficient Short-term Public Key broadcast authentication scheme. The basic idea is to use short-length public/private keys, but limit their lifetime to only a short period of time. To cover a long period of time, we need to use many public/private key pairs; distributing these public keys to sensors is a challenging problem. We describe a progressive key distribution scheme that is secure, efficient, and packet-loss resilient. We compare our scheme with the traditional 160-bit ECC public key schemes, and show that our scheme can achieve a significant improvement on energy consumption.",

Such severe constraints have led scholars to suggest wired centralized monitoring solutions, which have only recently been complemented with wireless technologies. This article suggests a hybrid wireless-wired monitoring system combining the advantages of wireless and wired technologies within a distributed high-frequency-sampling framework. The suggested architecture satisfies the mentioned constraints, thanks to an ad-hoc design of the hardware, the availability of efficient energy management policies, and up-to-date harvesting mechanisms. At the same time, the architecture supports adaptation capabilities by relying on the remote reprogrammability of key application parameters.

    "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks, a critical system service is the localization service that determines the locations of geographically distributed sensor nodes. The raw data used by this service are the distance measurements between neighboring nodes and the position knowledge of anchor nodes. However, these raw data may contain outliers that strongly deviate from their true values, which include both the outlier distances and the outlier anchors. These outliers can severely degrade the accuracy of the localization service. Therefore, we need a robust localization algorithm that can reject these outliers. Previous studies in this field mainly focus on enhancing multilateration with outlier rejection ability, since multilateration is a primitive operation used by localization service. But patch merging, a powerful operation for increasing the percentage of localizable nodes in sparse networks, is almost neglected. We thus propose a robust patch merging operation that can reject outliers for both multilateration and patch merging. Based on this operation, we further propose a robust network localization algorithm called RobustLoc . This algorithm makes two major contributions. (1) RobustLoc can achieve a high percentage of localizable nodes in both dense and sparse networks. In contrast, previous methods based on robust multilateration almost always fail in sparse networks with average degrees between 5 and 7. Our experiments show that RobustLoc can localize about 90% of nodes in a sparse network with 5.5 degrees. (2) As far as we know, RobustLoc is the first to uncover the differences between outlier distances and outlier anchors. Our simulations show that RobustLoc can reject colluding outlier anchors reliably in both convex and concave networks.",

Many papers have proposed methods for improving the network reliability of WSNs. However, real WSN deployments show that sensor data-faults are very common. Several server-side data reliability techniques have been proposed to detect these faults and impute missing or erroneous data. Typically, these techniques reduce the lifetime of the network due to redundant data transmission, increase latency, and are computation and storage intensive. Herein, we propose Packet-Level Attestation (PLA), a novel framework for sensor data reliability assessment. It exploits the spatial correlation of data sensed at nearby sensors. The method does not incur additional transmission of control message between source and sink; instead, a verifier node sends a validation certificate as part of the regular data packet. PLA was implemented in TinyOS on TelosB motes and its performances was assessed. Simulations were performed to determine its scalability. It incurs only an overhead of 1.45% in terms of packets transmitted. Fault detection precision of the framework varied from 100% to 99.48%. Comparisons with existing methods for data reliability analysis showed a significant reduction in data transmission, prolonging the network lifetime.",

In this work, we develop a generalized NUM model to consider three key new features observed in mission-centric WSN environments: i) the definition of the utility of an individual mission (receiver) as a joint function of data from multiple sensor sources; ii) the consumption of each sender's (sensor) data by multiple missions; and iii) the multicast-tree-based dissemination of each sensor's data flow, using link-layer broadcasts to exploit the “wireless broadcast advantage” in data forwarding. We show how a price-based, distributed protocol (WSN-NUM) can ensure optimal and proportionally fair rate allocation across multiple missions, without requiring any coordination among missions or sensors. We also discuss techniques to improve the speed of convergence of the protocol, which is essential in an environment as dynamic as the WSN. Further, we analyze the impact of various network and protocol parameters on the bandwidth utilization of the network, using a discrete-event simulation of a stationary wireless network. Finally, we corroborate our simulation-based performance results of the WSN-NUM protocol with an implementation of an 802.11b network.",

    "abstract": "The use of topological features, more specifically, the importance of an element related to its structural position, is a subject widely studied in the literature. For instance, the theory of complex networks provides centrality measures that have been applied to a large variety of fields (e.g., social sciences and biology). In this work, we propose a new topological measure, the Sink Betweenness (SBet), which stems from the theory of complex networks but is adapted to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to capture relevant information for this kind of network. We also provide a distributed algorithm to calculate it, and show its applicability to two different scenarios. The first one is focused on data fusion applications for event-driven WSNs, where we devise a tree-based data collection algorithm that takes advantage of node centrality to improve the data fusion efficiency. The second scenario is focused on energy balancing problems, more specifically in a problem called energy hole , where nodes closer to the sink are more likely to relay a larger number of packets than those that are further. This phenomenon is strongly related to the topology induced by the deployment of nodes along the sensor field, and it can be effectively captured by the SBet metric. Thus, we devise a data collection algorithm that is able to distribute the relay task more evenly. Simulation results show that the SBet metric can be satisfactorily used in both scenarios. We compare the proposed approach with some of the most efficient available data fusion algorithms, and show that the proposed algorithm generates consistently good-quality data collection infrastructures which require significantly smaller overhead. The use of SBet allows to alleviate the energy-hole effects by evenly balancing the relay load, and thus increasing the network lifetime. These two applications illustrate how the topology awareness can be used to improve different network functions in a WSN.",

    "abstract": "We address the energy-efficient data redistribution problem in data-intensive sensor networks (DISNs). In a DISN, a large volume of data gets generated, which is first stored in the network and is later collected for further analysis when the next uploading opportunity arises. The key concern in DISNs is to be able to redistribute the data from data-generating nodes into the network under limited storage and energy constraints at the sensor nodes. We formulate the data redistribution problem where the objective is to minimize the total energy consumption during this process while guaranteeing full utilization of the distributed storage capacity in the DISNs. We show that the problem is APX-hard for arbitrary data sizes; therefore, a polynomial time approximation algorithm is unlikely. For unit data sizes, we show that the problem is equivalent to the minimum cost flow problem, which can be solved optimally. However, the optimal solution's centralized nature makes it unsuitable for large-scale distributed sensor networks. Thus, we design a distributed algorithm for the data redistribution problem which performs very close to the optimal, and compare its performance with various intuitive heuristics. The distributed algorithm relies on potential function-based computations, incurs limited message and computational overhead at both the sensor nodes and data generator nodes, and is easily implementable in a distributed manner. We analytically study the convergence and performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its near-optimal performance and scalability under various network scenarios. In addition, we implement the distributed algorithm in TinyOS, evaluate it using TOSSIM simulator, and show that it outperforms EnviroStore, the only existing scheme for data redistribution in sensor networks, in both solution quality and message overhead. Finally, we extend the proposed algorithm to avoid disproportionate energy consumption at different sensor nodes without compromising the solution quality.",

    "abstract": "A problem is introduced in which a moving body (robot, human, animal, vehicle, and so on) travels among obstacles and binary detection beams that connect between obstacles or barriers. Each beam can be viewed as a virtual sensor that may have many possible alternative implementations. The task is to determine the possible body paths based only on sensor observations that each simply report that a beam crossing occurred. This is a basic filtering problem encountered in many settings, under a variety of sensing modalities. Filtering methods are presented that reconstruct the set of possible paths at three levels of resolution: (1) the possible sequences of regions (bounded by beams and obstacles) visited, (2) equivalence classes of homo-topic paths, and (3) the possible numbers of times the path winds around obstacles. In the simplest case, all beams are disjoint, distinguishable, and directed. More complex cases are then considered, allowing for any amount of beams overlapping, indistinguishability, and lack of directional information. The method was implemented in simulation. An inexpensive, low-energy, easily deployable architecture was also created which implements the beam model and validates the methods of the article with experiments.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the collective action of participating smartphone users, mobile crowdsensing allows data collection at a scale and pace that was once impossible. The biggest challenge to overcome in mobile crowdsensing is that participants may exhibit malicious or unreliable behavior, thus compromising the accuracy of the data collection process. Therefore, it becomes imperative to design algorithms to accurately classify between reliable and unreliable sensing reports. To address this crucial issue, we propose a novel Framework for optimizing Information Reliability in Smartphone-based participaTory sensing (FIRST) that leverages mobile trusted participants (MTPs) to securely assess the reliability of sensing reports. FIRST models and solves the challenging problem of determining before deployment the minimum number of MTPs to be used to achieve desired classification accuracy. After a rigorous mathematical study of its performance, we extensively evaluate FIRST through an implementation in iOS and Android of a room occupancy monitoring system and through simulations with real-world mobility traces. Experimental results demonstrate that FIRST reduces significantly the impact of three security attacks (i.e., corruption, on/off, and collusion) by achieving a classification accuracy of almost 80% in the considered scenarios. Finally, we discuss our ongoing research efforts to test the performance of FIRST as part of the National Map Corps project.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that periodically putting nodes into sleep can effectively save energy in wireless sensor networks at the cost of increased communication delays. However, most existing work mainly focuses on the static sleep scheduling, which cannot guarantee the desired delay when the network conditions change dynamically. In many applications with user-specified end-to-end delay requirements, the duty cycle of every node should be tuned individually at runtime based on the network conditions to achieve the desired end-to-end delay guarantees and energy efficiency. In this article, we propose DutyCon, a control theory-based dynamic duty-cycle control approach. DutyCon decomposes the end-to-end delay guarantee problem into a set of single-hop delay guarantee problems along each data flow in the network. We then formulate the single-hop delay guarantee problem as a dynamic feedback control problem and design the controller rigorously, based on feedback control theory, for analytic assurance of control accuracy and system stability. DutyCon also features a queuing delay adaptation scheme that adapts the duty cycle of each node to unpredictable incoming packet rates, as well as a novel energy-balancing approach that extends the network lifetime by dynamically adjusting the delay requirement allocated to each hop. Our empirical results on a hardware testbed demonstrate that DutyCon can effectively achieve the desired trade-off between end-to-end delay and energy conservation. Extensive simulation results also show that DutyCon outperforms two baseline sleep scheduling protocols by having more energy savings while meeting the end-to-end delay requirements.",

    "abstract": "Energy conservation is essential in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) because of limited energy in nodes' batteries. Collaborative beamforming uses multiple transmitters to form antenna arrays; the electromagnetic waves from these antenna arrays can create constructive interferences at the receiver and increase the transmission distance. Each transmitter can use lower power and save energy, since the energy consumption is spread over multiple transmitters. Each beamforming transmission requires multiple collaborative transmitters. Repetitively using the same transmitters will deplete their energy and create coverage holes in the sensing area. To prevent holes, energy should be balanced by using different transmitters. This article investigates the factors that can affect the energy consumption and network lifetime when using beamforming. We present an algorithm for selecting the transmitters in order to prolong the network lifetime. Compared with an existing beamforming transmitters scheduling algorithm, our algorithm doubles the network lifetime. When compared with direct transmission or multihop transmissions towards a receiver far away from the sensing area, our approach can increase the network's lifetime substantially.",

We first investigate multichannel realities in WSNs through intensive empirical experiments with Micaz motes. Our study shows that current multichannel protocols are not suitable for WSNs because of the small number of available channels and unavoidable time errors found in real networks. With these observations, we propose a novel tree-based, multichannel scheme for data collection applications, which allocates channels to disjoint trees and exploits parallel transmissions among trees. In order to minimize interference within trees, we define a new channel assignment problem that is proven NP-complete. Then, we propose a greedy channel allocation algorithm that outperforms other schemes in dense networks with a small number of channels. We implement our protocol, called the Tree-based, Multichannel Protocol (TMCP), in a real testbed. To adjust to networks with link quality heterogeneity, an extension of TMCP is also proposed. Through both simulation and real experiments, we show that TMCP can significantly improve network throughput and reduce packet losses. More important, evaluation results show that TMCP better accommodates multichannel realities found in WSNs than other multichannel protocols.",

The main focus is on estimates produced by considering the mobile device readings at a random instant in time. We compare stratified sampling with different stratification weights to sampling without stratification as well as an appropriately modified version of systematic sampling. Our main result is that stratification with weights proportional to stratum areas can produce significantly smaller bias for a moderate number of strata and gets arbitrarily close to the true area average as the number of mobiles increases. The performance of the methods is evaluated for an application scenario where we estimate the mean area temperature in a linear region that exhibits the so-called Urban Heat Island effect, with mobile users moving in the region according to the Random Waypoint Model.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained real-time metering is a fundamental service of wireless energy auditing networks, where metering data is transmitted from embedded wireless power meters to gateways for centralized processing, storage, and forwarding. Due to limited meter capability and wireless bandwidth, the increasing sampling rates and network scales needed to support new energy auditing applications pose significant challenges to metering data fidelity and secrecy . This article exploits the compression and encryption properties of compressive sensing (CS) to design a jo&lt;underline&gt;i&lt;/underline&gt;nt data &lt;underline&gt;c&lt;/underline&gt;ompression and &lt;underline&gt;e&lt;/underline&gt;ncryption (JICE) approach that addresses these two challenges simultaneously. Compared with a conventional signal processing pipeline that compresses and encrypts data sequentially, JICE reduces computation and space complexities due to its simple design. It thus leaves more processor time and available buffer space for handling lossy wireless transmissions. Moreover, JICE features an adaptive reconfiguration mechanism that selects the signal representation basis of CS at runtime among several candidate bases to achieve the best fidelity of the recovered data at the gateways. This mechanism enables JICE to adapt to changing power consumption patterns. On a smart plug platform, we implemented JICE and several baseline approaches including downsampling, lossless compression, and the pipeline approach. Extensive testbed experiments show that JICE achieves higher data delivery ratios and lower recovery distortions under a range of realistic settings. In particular, at a meter sampling rate of 8 Hz, JICE increases the number of meters supported by a gateway by 50%, compared with the commonly used pipeline approach, while keeping a signal distortion rate lower than 5%.",

    "abstract": "The MAC standard amendment IEEE 802.15.4e is designed to meet the requirements of industrial and critical applications. In particular, the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode divides time into periodic, equally sized, slotframes composed of transmission timeslots. Then, it combines time slotted access with multichannel and channel hopping capabilities, providing large network capacity, high reliability, and predictable latency while ensuring energy efficiency. Since every network node considers the same timeslots at each slotframe and selects physical channels according to a periodic function, TSCH produces a steady channel utilization pattern. This can be exploited by a selective jammer to entirely thwart communications of a victim node in a way that is stealthy, effective, and extremely energy efficient. This article shows how a selective jamming attack can be successfully performed even though TSCH uses the IEEE 802.15.4e security services. Furthermore, we propose DISH, a countermeasure which randomly permutes the timeslot and channel utilization patterns at every slotframe in a consistent and completely distributed way without requiring any additional message exchange. We have implemented DISH for the Contiki OS and tested its effectiveness on TelosB sensor nodes. Quantitative analysis for different network configurations shows that DISH effectively contrasts selective jamming with negligible performance penalty.",

The Dominating Set (DS) is a key method to maintain the coverage of traditional WSNs, and it can be also adopted in the RF-based battery-free sensor networks. However, considering the specific features of RF-based battery-free sensor networks, the DS construction is totally different from that in traditional WSNs. Thus, the problem of constructing DS in a battery-free sensor network is deeply investigated in this article. The NP-Hardness of such problem is proved. Four approximation algorithms are proposed to deal with the snapshot and continuous DS construction requirements, respectively. The approximation ratios of these four algorithms have been analyzed, and the theoretical results show that all these four algorithms are effective. Furthermore, the electromagnetic interference problem in the RF-based battery-free sensor network is considered and defined. An approximated algorithm is proposed to solve such problem. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

One important challenge is that network holes may arbitrarily increase the routing path length. Fortunately, recent studies have shown that constant path stretch is achievable using nonlocal information. The constant stretch, however, is possible at the cost of high communication and storage overhead: a source node must complete a “path-setup” process prior to data transmission by exchanging a message with a destination node using a default geographic routing (e.g., GPSR). In this article, we propose the first geographic routing protocol (LVGR) that provably achieves worst-case stretch of Θ (D/γ) (where D is the diameter of the network and γ is the communication range of nodes) with low communication and storage overhead . LVGR represents a hole as a convex hull, the internal structure of which is represented as a local visibility graph . Based on the convex hulls and local visibility graphs, LVGR generates paths with guaranteed stretch. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we prove the worst-case stretch of LVGR and demonstrate that LVGR reduces communication overhead by up to 97% and storage overhead by up to 60%, compared with the state of the art.",

Physical-level models that calculate the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for every incoming bit are too slow to be used for large-scale or long-term networking experiments, and link-level models such as those currently used by the NS2 simulator do not accurately predict protocol performance.

We confirm the validity of CAMA through comparison with the empirical traces of the experiments conducted by various numbers of CC1000 and CC2420-based nodes in different scenarios. Our results indicate that CAMA can accurately predict the packet reception, corruption, and collision detection rates of real radios, while existing models currently used by the NS2 simulator produce substantial prediction error.",

We estimate such a probability by a thorough study and signal-level simulations of the UWB physical layer. We test SPEM both in a simulated environment and in a real indoor environment using real UWB transceivers.

In applications where the MSs are humans, animals, or transportation systems, the mobility of the MSs is often uncontrollable and could also be random and unpredictable. This implies the necessity of algorithms tailored to handle uncertainty on the MS mobility. In this article, we define the lifetime optimization of a WSN in the presence of uncontrollable sink mobility and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. After defining an ideal scheme (called Oracle ) which provably maximizes network lifetime, we present a novel Swarm-Intelligence-based Sensor Selection Algorithm (SISSA), which optimizes network lifetime and meets predefined QoS constraints. Then we mathematically analyze SISSA and derive analytical bounds on energy consumption, number of messages exchanged, and convergence time. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated on practical experimental setups, and its performances are compared to that by the optimal Oracle scheme, as well as with the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and TDMA schemes. Results conclude that SISSA provides on the average the 56% of the lifetime provided by Oracle and outperforms IEEE 802.15.4 and TDMA in terms of yielded network lifetime.",

    "abstract": "The emerging energy-harvesting technology enables charging sensor batteries with renewable energy sources, which has been effectively integrated into Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs). Due to the limited energy-harvesting capacities of tiny sensors, the captured energy remains scarce and differs greatly among nodes, which makes the data aggregation scheduling problem more challenging than that in energy-abundant WSNs. In this article, we investigate the Minimum Latency Aggregation Scheduling (MLAS) problem in EH-WSNs. First, we identify a new kind of collision in EH-WSNs, named as energy-collision, and design several special structures to avoid it during data aggregation. To reduce the latency, we try to choose the parent adaptively according to nodes’ transmission tasks and energy-harvesting ability, under the consideration of collisions avoidance. By considering transmitting time, residual energy, and energy-collision, three scheduling algorithms are proposed under protocol interference model. Under physical interference model, several approximate algorithms are also designed by taking account of the interference from the nodes several hops away. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of latency.",

    "abstract": "Edge computing (EC) is a promising paradigm for providing ultra-low latency experience for IoT applications at the network edge, through pre-caching required services in fixed edge nodes. However, the supply-demand mismatch can arise while meeting the peak period of some specific service requests. The mismatch between capacity provision and user demands can be fatal to the delay-sensitive user requests of emerging IoT applications and will be further exacerbated due to the long service provisioning cycle. To tackle this problem, we propose the mobile-assisted edge computing framework to improve the QoS of fixed edge nodes by exploiting mobile edge nodes. Furthermore, we devise a CRI (Credible, Reciprocal, and Incentive) auction mechanism to stimulate mobile edge nodes to participate in the services for user requests. The advantages of our mobile-assisted edge computing framework include higher task completion rate, profit maximization, and computational efficiency. Meanwhile, the theoretical analysis and experimental results guarantee the desirable economic properties of our CRI auction mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Mobile Augmented Reality (AR), which overlays digital content on the real-world scenes surrounding a user, is bringing immersive interactive experiences where the real and virtual worlds are tightly coupled. To enable seamless and precise AR experiences, an image recognition system that can accurately recognize the object in the camera view with low system latency is required. However, due to the pervasiveness and severity of image distortions, an effective and robust image recognition solution for “in the wild” mobile AR is still elusive. In this article, we present CollabAR, an edge-assisted system that provides distortion-tolerant image recognition for mobile AR with imperceptible system latency . CollabAR incorporates both distortion-tolerant and collaborative image recognition modules in its design. The former enables distortion-adaptive image recognition to improve the robustness against image distortions, while the latter exploits the spatial-temporal correlation among mobile AR users to improve recognition accuracy. Moreover, as it is difficult to collect a large-scale image distortion dataset, we propose a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network-based data augmentation method to synthesize realistic image distortion. Our evaluation demonstrates that CollabAR achieves over 85% recognition accuracy for “in the wild” images with severe distortions, while reducing the end-to-end system latency to as low as 18.2 ms.",

Considering such devices, e.g., surveillance cameras or AR/VR gadgets, are resource constrained, although there has been significant work in creating lightweight deep neural networks (DNNs) for such clients, none of these can adapt to changing runtime conditions, e.g., changes in resource availability on the device, the content characteristics, or requirements from the user. In this article, we introduce ApproxNet, a video object classification system for embedded or mobile clients. It enables novel dynamic approximation techniques to achieve desired inference latency and accuracy trade-off under changing runtime conditions. It achieves this by enabling two approximation knobs within a single DNN model rather than creating and maintaining an ensemble of models, e.g., MCDNN [MobiSys-16]. We show that ApproxNet can adapt seamlessly at runtime to these changes, provides low and stable latency for the image and video frame classification problems, and shows the improvement in accuracy and latency over ResNet [CVPR-16], MCDNN [MobiSys-16], MobileNets [Google-17], NestDNN [MobiCom-18], and MSDNet [ICLR-18].",

However, today’s radio-based solutions fail to locate the target in millimeter-level due to their limited bandwidth and sampling rate, which constrains their applications in high-accuracy demand scenarios. We find an opportunity to break the bottleneck of existing radio-based localization systems by reconstructing the accurate signal spectral peak from the discrete samples, without changing either the bandwidth or the sampling rate of the radio hardware. This study proposes milliLoc , a millimeter-level radio-based localization system. We first derive a spectral peak reconstruction algorithm to reduce the ranging error from the previous centimeter-level to millimeter-level. Then, we improve the AoA measurement accuracy by leveraging the signal amplitude information. To ensure the practicality of milliLoc , we further extend our system to handle multi-target situations. We fully implement milliLoc on a commercial mmWave radar. Experiments show that milliLoc achieves a median ranging accuracy of 5.5 mm and decreases the AoA measurement error by 31.2% compared with the baseline. Our system fulfills the accuracy requirements of most application scenarios and can be easily integrated with other existing solutions, shedding light on high-accuracy location-based applications.",

Traditional image encryption uses the snowflake effect to protect the privacy, but this can compromise the usability of directly browsing images captured by nodes in VSNs. Recently, thumbnail-preserving encryption (TPE) has been proposed to balance image usability and privacy. However, the Markov chain’s limited connectivity and high time cost, which result in low efficiency, may preclude its application in VSNs. Motivated by this, we propose a novel TPE scheme to protect the image collected in VSNs’ privacy efficiently. We first deeply study the bijective relationship between the three-pixel group and its rank, and then propose a new number method for both, based on which we design the efficient rank mapping. Subsequently, an efficient thumbnail-preserving image encryption via three-pixel rank mapping (E-TPE) is designed, achieving NR security and enhancing the Markov chain’s connectivity. The experiments demonstrate the scheme’s efficiency; that is, it is currently the quickest ideal-TPE scheme with NR security, and a good balance is achieved between usability and privacy.",

Each sensor node is rechargeable, and can hold up to K quanta of energy. When the recharge and/or discharge processes in the network are random, the problem of optimal sensor activation is a complex stochastic decision question. For the case of identical sensor coverages, we show the existence of a simple threshold policy which is asymptotically optimal with respect to the energy bucket size K , that is, the performance of this threshold policy approaches the optimal performance as K becomes large. We also show that the performance of the optimal threshold policy is robust to the degree of spatial correlation in the discharge and/or recharge processes. We then extend this approach to a general sensor network where coverage areas of different sensors could have complete, partial or no overlap with each other. We demonstrate through simulations that a local information based threshold policy, with an appropriately chosen threshold, achieves a performance which is very close to the global optimum.",

    "abstract": "Mobile sinks are needed in many sensor network applications for efficient data collection, data querying, localized sensor reprogramming, identifying, and revoking compromised sensors, and other network maintenance. Employing mobile sinks however raises a new security challenge: if a mobile sink is given too many privileges, it will become very attractive for attack and compromise. Using a compromised mobile sink, an adversary may easily bring down or even take over the sensor network. Thus, security mechanisms that can tolerate mobile sink compromises are essential. In this article, based on the principle of least privilege , we first propose an efficient scheme to restrict the privilege of a mobile sink without impeding its ability to carry out any authorized operations for an assigned task. In addition, we present an extension to allow conditional trajectory change due to unexpected events. To further reduce the possible damage caused by a compromised mobile sink, we propose efficient message forwarding schemes for deleting the privilege assigned to a compromised mobile sink immediately after its compromise has been detected. Through detailed analysis, simulation, and real implementation, we show that our schemes are secure and efficient, and are highly practical for sensor networks consisting of the current generation of sensors.",

The problem of data forwarding is complicated by the severe energy constraints of sensors in WSNs. In this work, we propose and analyze a data forwarding scheme, termed Multihop/Direct Forwarding (MDF), for WSNs where sensor nodes forward data traffic toward a common data sink. In the MDF scheme, a node splits outgoing traffic into at most two branches: one is sent to a node that is h units away; the other is sent directly to the data sink. The value of h is chosen to minimize the overall energy consumption of the network. The direct transmission is employed to balance the energy consumption of nodes at different locations and to avoid the so-called hot spot problem in data forwarding. In order to calculate its traffic splitting ratio, a node only needs to know the distance toward the common data sink and that of the farthest node. Our analytical and simulation results show that the MDF scheme performs close to, in terms of energy efficiency and network lifetime, the optimum data forwarding rules, which are more complex and computation intensive.",

Sensors' locations are assumed to be known at the sink node, up to a certain position error. We then take the mean square error (MSE) of the reconstructed field as performance metric, and evaluate the effect of both uniform and quasi-equally spaced sensor layouts on the quality of the reconstructed field. We define a parameter that provides a measure of the regularity of the sensors deployment, and, through asymptotic analysis, we derive the MSE in the case of different sensor spatial distributions.

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that network coding has great potential to improve network performance in wireless communication. The performance of network coding in real-world scenarios, however, varies dramatically. It is reported that network coding brings negligible improvements but extra coding overhead in some scenarios. In this article, for the first time, we analyze the impact of link correlation on network coding and quantify the coding benefits. We propose correlated coding, which encodes packets only when performance improvement is achieved. Correlated coding uses only one-hop information, which makes it work in a fully distributed manner and introduces minimal communication overhead. The highlight of the design is its broad applicability and effectiveness. We implement the design with four broadcast protocols and three unicast protocols, and we evaluate them extensively on one 802.11 testbed and three 802.15.4 testbeds. The experimental results show that (i) more coding operations do not lead to fewer transmissions, and (ii) compared to existing network coding protocols, the number of transmissions is reduced with lower coding overhead.",

    "abstract": "When a person is walking the RF signal strength of an on-body communication link may exhibit significant fluctuation with peak-to-peak amplitudes beyond 20 dB. Instantaneous signal strength may be noisy, but the smoothed signal typically exhibits a period that matches the person's stride period. We present an opportunistic packet scheduler that extracts a set of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) samples from application traffic and utilizes an accelerometer to monitor the person's gait cycle. Packets are scheduled based on previous RSSI peaks and the current offset within the gait cycle. We formulate the task of finding a nonoverlapping packet schedule among the different body area network (BAN) devices as a linear programming problem and present an efficient way of solving it with the simplex method. Our experimental evaluation shows that outdoors BAN links with PRR (ratio of correctly received to transmitted packets) values between 50% and 90% can typically be turned into reliable links with PRR values well above 90%. Indoors the improvements are smaller, but still significant at low transmission power. The main price is an increase in packet delivery latency. The energy consumed by the devices is marginal, but the coordinator spends more energy due to signal processing.",

Of particular concern is the problem of selecting a common transmission range for all of the sensor nodes, the resource replication level (or time-to-live counter), and the active/sleep schedule of nodes while satisfying connectivity and quality-of-service constraints. To this end, we first formulate a general, mixed-integer programming model that selects the optimal operating parameters in each period of a finite planning horizon. Subsequently, we examine in detail specific connectivity and quality-of-service constraints that can be considered within this framework. Due to the complexity of the model, we formulate an alternative linearized version that can be solved more efficiently. Additionally, we devise a simple algorithm to solve a special case of the problem when alive nodes are always active. Computational results indicate that the maximum attainable lifetime can be significantly improved by adjusting the key operating parameters as sensor nodes fail over time due to energy depletion.",

    "abstract": "Separation of Control and Data Planes (SCDP) is a desirable paradigm for low-power multi-hop wireless sensor networks requiring high network performance and manageability. Existing SCDP networks generally adopt an in-band control plane scheme in that the control-plane messages are delivered by their data-plane networks. The physical coupling of the two planes may lead to undesirable consequences. Recently, multi-radio platforms (e.g., TI CC1350 and OpenMote B) are increasingly available, which make the physical separation of the control and data planes possible. To advance the network architecture design, we propose to leverage on the long-range communication capability of the Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) radios to form one-hop out-of-band control planes. LoRaWAN, an open, inexpensive, and ISM band based LPWAN radio, is chosen to prototype our out-of-band control plane called LoRaCP. Several characteristics of LoRaWAN such as downlink-uplink asymmetry and primitive ALOHA media access control need to be dealt with to achieve high reliability and efficiency. To address these challenges, a TDMA-based multi-channel transmission control is designed, which features an urgent channel and negative acknowledgment. On a testbed of 16 nodes, LoRaCP is applied to physically separate the control-plane network of the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) from its Zigbee-based data-plane network. Extensive experiments show that LoRaCP increases CTP’s packet delivery ratio from 65% to 80% in the presence of external interference, while consuming a per-node average radio power of 2.97mW only.",

    "abstract": "Energy harvesting is a promising solution for reducing network maintenance and the overhead of replacing chemical batteries in sensor networks. In this article, problems related to controlling an active wireless sensor network comprised of nodes powered by both rechargeable batteries and solar energy are investigated. The objective of this control is to maximize the network's Quality of Coverage (QoC), defined as the minimum number of targets that can be covered by the network over a 24-hour period. Assuming a time-varying solar profile, the underlying problem is to optimally control the sensing range of each sensor so as to maximize the QoC. The problem is further constrained by requiring all active sensors to report any sensed data to a centralized base station, making connectivity a key factor in sensor management. Implicit in the solution is the allocation of solar energy during the day to sensing tasks and recharging of the battery so that a minimum coverage is guaranteed at all times. The problem turns out to be a nonlinear optimal control problem of high complexity. By exploiting the particular structure of the problem, we present a novel method for determining near-optimal sensing radii and routing paths as a series of quasiconvex (unimodal) optimization problems. The runtime of the proposed solution is 60X less than the standard optimal control method based on dynamic programming, while the worst-case error is less than 8%. The proposed method is scalable to large networks consisting of hundreds of sensors and targets. Several insights in the design of energy-harvesting networks are provided.",

    "abstract": "The energy consumption of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) correlates with the voltage level at which the nodes are powered—a lowered voltage leads to a prolonged lifetime of nodes and networks. Operating nodes at voltage levels below the recommendation—so-called undervolting—saves energy but is accompanied by an increased risk of failures. In this article, we show that a WSN can still work reliably, even if the voltage recommendations are violated. We show that there is a correlation between temperature and error-proneness at the same voltage level and that ideal voltage levels depend on environmental conditions. Especially in outdoor deployments, temperatures fluctuate often and heavily. Additionally, we show that these ideal voltage levels are different for each individual node. To deal with these individual variations and varying temperatures, we present a supervised learning strategy that is able to keep the nodes in uncritical states even if environmental conditions are constantly and heavily changing while saving as much energy as possible by constantly adapting the voltage level of these nodes to an individually ideal level. All measurements were performed on sensor node prototypes that are also presented in this article. In detailed evaluations, it is shown (i) that a single node will never run in the same unsafe state twice, (ii) that only five known bias points are needed to predict nearly all temperature dependencies for an individual node, and, thus, (iii) that a system of undervolted nodes can be as reliable as a conventionally powered network while prolonging the lifetime by more than 40%.",

Environmental energy sources vary widely and are often difficult both to predict and to reproduce in the lab during testing. These variations are also behavior dependent—a factor that leaves application engineers unable to make even simple comparisons between algorithms or hardware configurations, using traditional testing approaches. In this article, we describe the design and evaluation of Ekho, an emulator capable of recording energy harvesting conditions and accurately recreating those conditions in the lab. This makes it possible to conduct realistic and repeatable experiments involving energy harvesting devices. Ekho is a general-purpose, mobile tool that supports a wide range of harvesting technologies. We demonstrate, using a working prototype, that Ekho is capable of reproducing solar, Radio Frequency (RF), and kinetic energy harvesting environments accurately and consistently. Our results show that Ekho can recreate harvesting-dependent program behaviors by emulating energy harvesting conditions accurately to within 77.4μA for solar and 15.0μA for kinetic environments, and can emulate RF energy harvesting conditions consistently.",

However, collecting such measurements from every node in the network, although providing high accuracy and resolution of the phenomena of interest, may easily cause sensors’ battery depletion. In this article, we show that measurement correlation can be successfully exploited to reduce the amount of data collected in the network without significantly sacrificing the monitoring accuracy. In particular, we propose an online adaptive measurement technique with which a subset of nodes are dynamically chosen as monitors while the measurements of the remaining nodes are estimated using the computed correlations. We propose an estimation framework based on jointly Gaussian distributed random variables, and we formulate an optimization problem to select the monitors under a total cost constraint. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and propose three efficient heuristics. We also develop statistical approaches that automatically switch between learning and estimation phases to take into account the variability occurring in real networks. Simulations carried out on real-world traces show that our approach outperforms previous solutions based on compressed sensing, and it can be successfully applied to the real application of solar irradiance prediction of photovoltaics systems.",

A fundamental problem of mobile crowdsourcing is: When both tasks and crowd workers appear in the platforms dynamically, how to assign an appropriate set of tasks to each worker. Most existing studies focus on efficient assignment algorithms based on bipartite graph matching. However, they overlook an important fact that crowd workers might be unreliable. Thus, their task assignment schemes cannot ensure the overall quality. In this article, we investigate the Quality-aware Online Task Assignment (QAOTA) problem in mobile crowdsourcing. We propose a probabilistic model to measure the quality of tasks and a hitchhiking model to characterize workers’ behavior patterns. We model task assignment as a quality maximization problem and derive a polynomial-time online assignment algorithm. Through rigorous analysis, we prove that the proposed algorithm approximates the offline optimal solution with a competitive ratio of 10/7.

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are commonly deployed in dynamic environments where events, such as moving sensor nodes and changing external interference, impact the performance, or Quality of Service (QoS), of the network. QoS is expressed by the values of multiple, possibly conflicting, network quality metrics, such as network lifetime and maximum latency of communicating a packet to the sink. Sufficient QoS should be provided by the WSN to ensure that the end-user can successfully use the WSN to perform its application. We propose a distributed reconfiguration approach that actively maintains a sufficient level of QoS at runtime for a heterogeneous WSN in a dynamic environment. Every node uses a feedback control strategy to resolve any difference between the current and required QoS of the network by adapting controllable parameters of the protocol stack. Example parameters are the transmission power and maximum number of packet retransmissions. Nodes collaborate such that, with the combined adaptations, the required network QoS is achieved. The behavior of the reconfiguration approach and the tradeoffs involved are analyzed in detail. With the use of simulations and experiments with actual deployments, we show that our approach allows a better optimization of QoS objectives while constraints are met; for example, it achieves the same packet loss with a significantly longer lifetime, compared to current (re-)configuration approaches.",

This article considers a synchronization-free approach to timestamping LoRaWAN uplink data based on signal arrival time at the gateway, which well matches LoRaWAN’s one-hop star topology and releases bandwidth from transmitting timestamps and synchronizing end devices’ clocks at all times. However, we show that this approach is susceptible to a frame delay attack consisting of malicious frame collision and delayed replay. Real experiments show that the attack can affect the end devices in large areas up to about 50,000, m 2 . In a broader sense, the attack threatens any system functions requiring timely deliveries of LoRaWAN frames. To address this threat, we propose a LoRaTS gateway design that integrates a commodity LoRaWAN gateway and a low-power software-defined radio receiver to track the inherent frequency biases of the end devices. Based on an analytic model of LoRa’s chirp spread spectrum modulation, we develop signal processing algorithms to estimate the frequency biases with high accuracy beyond that achieved by LoRa’s default demodulation. The accurate frequency bias tracking capability enables the detection of the attack that introduces additional frequency biases. We also investigate and implement a more crafty attack that uses advanced radio apparatuses to eliminate the frequency biases. To address this crafty attack, we propose a pseudorandom interval hopping scheme to enhance our frequency bias tracking approach.

Meanwhile, most IoT applications usually impose Service Function Chain (SFC) enforcement on their data transmission, where each data packet from its source gateway of an IoT device to the destination (a cloudlet) of the IoT application must pass through each Virtual Network Function (VNF) in the SFC in an MEC network. However, little attention has been paid on such a service provisioning of multi-source IoT applications in an MEC network with SFC enforcement. In this article, we study service provisioning in an MEC network for multi-source IoT applications with SFC requirements and aiming at minimizing the cost of such service provisioning, where each IoT application has multiple data streams from different sources to be uploaded to a location (cloudlet) in the MEC network for aggregation, processing, and storage purposes. To this end, we first formulate two novel optimization problems: the cost minimization problem of service provisioning for a single multi-source IoT application, and the service provisioning problem for a set of multi-source IoT applications, respectively, and show that both problems are NP-hard. Second, we propose a service provisioning framework in the MEC network for multi-source IoT applications that consists of uploading stream data from multiple sources of the IoT application to the MEC network, data stream aggregation and routing through the VNF instance placement and sharing, and workload balancing among cloudlets. Third, we devise an efficient algorithm for the cost minimization problem built upon the proposed service provisioning framework, and further extend the solution for the service provisioning problem of a set of multi-source IoT applications. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are promising.",

We present the InPhase system for ranging and localization applications. It employs narrowband 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 radio transceivers to acquire the radio channel’s phase response. In comparison, most other systems employ time-of-flight schemes with Ultra Wideband transceivers. Our software can be used with existing wireless sensor network hardware, providing ranging and localization for existing devices at no extra cost. The introduced Complex-valued Distance Estimation algorithm evaluates the phase response to compute the distance between two radio devices. We achieve high ranging accuracy and precision with a mean absolute error of 0.149 m and a standard deviation of 0.104 m. We show that our algorithm is resilient against noise and burst errors from the phase-data acquisition. Further, we present a localization algorithm based on a particle filter implementation. It achieves a mean absolute error of 0.95 m in a realistic 3D live tracking scenario.",

The communication properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves in underwater resources like mud, water, oil, and other materials, as well as major variations between propagation in air, make classification of the underground wireless channel difficult. From the transmission of data, the channels modelling is involved to remove the noise and reduce the energy.

    "abstract": "With the advent of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), outsourcing network functions (NFs) to the MEC is becoming popular among network service providers (NSPs), since it brings the scalability and flexibility for NF deployment and maintenance. Each user’s request will go through a service function chain (SFC), which consists of several virtual network functions (VNFs, software substitutions for traditional hardware-based middleboxes) in a specific order, and then get a response. Unlike conventional hardware-based middleboxes, VNFs are not very reliable due to potential software faults and host malfunctions. Thus, a sensible way is to add redundancy for the primary VNFs of an SFC to enhance its availability. Nevertheless, which MEC node to place each VNF, and how many backup instances are enough to ensure the availability requirement of each SFC? These issues have not yet been resolved. In this article, we present the availability-aware provision of SFC (APoS) in the MEC environment with the primary goal of maximizing the number of served requests while meeting the requirements and reliability expectations of SFCs. For the APoS, we have primarily addressed the following two fundamental challenges: (i) First, how to efficiently map these primary and backup VNFs to meet the availability requirements of SFCs? At this point, we formulate it as an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) under the limitation of each MEC node’s resources. This issue is NP-hard, and a novel binary N-back search method is proposed to derive the optimal solution for the primary and backup VNFs mapping; (ii) Second, how can we reduce the latency for users to access their desired SFCs? Then, we investigate how to minimize the average delay for all requests in each time slot. To solve this problem, we design an online service switching (OSS) method, which jointly considers the queuing delay, communication delay, and switching delay. It achieves the optimal solution with a theoretical guarantee. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods with real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that, compared with the benchmarks, our practices can achieve approximately 20% request acceptance gain and up to 30% delay reduction, on average.",

The sensor data are mostly complex time series, such as traffic, electricity, and gas emission data. Accurate time series prediction can greatly help reduce energy consumption and gas emission. It is difficult to make accurate time series prediction because there are complex correlations among time series and the data have local and global nonlinear dependencies. To overcome the difficulties, we first analyze state-of-the-art works of time series prediction. Then we propose a new framework for Time series prediction evaluation for Energy conServation and emission reduction in Smart cities, called TESS. TESS is used to compare the latest time series prediction models based on six publicly available datasets and three simulation datasets. Based on the theoretical analysis and the experiment result, we get some interesting ideas: time series in smart cities often have obvious periodicity and scale changes, and need to be collected over the long term; skip-connection is helpful for learning long-term features of time series; the recurrent layer is good at predicting time series with obvious periodicity; and linear regression may be more appropriate for predicting time series with scale changes.",

However, CPS faces a great number of information security challenges (e.g., attacks) due to the integration of CPS as well as the human behaviors and interactions. Therefore, accurate and real-time attack detection and identification are essential to ensure information security and reliability of CPS. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated learning method that accurately detects an attack of a CPS system and then identifies the attack type in real time. Specifically, we consider a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) model that only relies on the data from the normal state for training to achieve a real-time and effective detection of a CPS system state (i.e., normal or under-attack). If the system is detected to be under-attack, we then develop a Pairwise Self-supervised Long Short-Term Memory (PSLSTM) approach to identify the attack type, which aims to accurately distinguish the known attack types and discover unknown new attacks. Lastly, experimental results show the proposed method achieves promising performances compared with conventional and state-of-the-art learning-based benchmarks.",

These mobile devices storing user sensitive and private information, therefore, need rigorous user authentication mechanisms. In this article, we present SearchAuth, a novel continuous authentication system on smartphones exploiting a neural architecture search (NAS) to find an optimal network architecture and an auto augmentation search (AAS) to more effectively train the optimal network along with the best data augmentation policies, by leveraging the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer on smartphones to capture users’ behavioral patterns. Specifically, SearchAuth consists of three stages, i.e., the offline stage, registration stage, and authentication stage. In the offline stage, we utilize the NAS on sensor data of the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to find an optimal network architecture based on the designed search space. With the optimal network architecture, namely, NAS-based model, the AAS automatically optimizes the augmentation of the input data for more effectively training the model that is for feature extraction. In the registration stage, we use the trained NAS-based model to learn and extract deep features from the legitimate user’s data, and train the LOF classifier with 55 features selected by the PCA. In the authentication stage, with the well-trained NAS-based model and LOF classifier, SearchAuth identifies the current user as a legitimate user or an impostor when the user starts operating a smartphone. Based on our dataset, we evaluate the performance of the proposed SearchAuth, and the experimental results demonstrate that SearchAuth surpasses the representative authentication schemes by achieving the best accuracy of 93.95%, F1-score of 94.30%, and EER of 5.30% on the LOF classifier with dataset size of 100.",

Meanwhile, mobile applications are becoming more complex, consisting of multiple dependent tasks, modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). When a request arrives, typically in an online manner with a deadline specified, we need to configure the servers and assign the dependent tasks for efficient processing. This work jointly considers the problem of dependent task placement and scheduling with on-demand function configuration on edge servers, aiming to meet as many deadlines as possible. For a single request, when the configuration on each edge server is fixed, we derive FixDoc to find the optimal task placement and scheduling. When the on-demand function configuration is allowed, we propose GenDoc , a novel approximation algorithm, and analyze its additive error from the optimal theoretically. For multiple requests, we derive OnDoc , an online algorithm easy to deploy in practice. Our extensive experiments show that GenDoc outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in processing 86.14% of these unique applications, and reduces their average completion time by at least 24%. The number of deadlines that OnDoc can satisfy is at least 1.9× that of the baselines.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the fast penetration of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) systems into our daily life, the security and privacy issues of the VR/AR applications have been attracting considerable attention. Most VR/AR systems adopt head-mounted devices (i.e., smart headsets) to interact with users and the devices usually store the users’ private data. Hence, authentication schemes are desired for the head-mounted devices. Traditional knowledge-based authentication schemes for general personal devices have been proved vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attacks, especially considering the headsets may block the sight of the users. Although the robustness of the knowledge-based authentication can be improved by designing complicated secret codes in virtual space, this approach induces a compromise of usability. Another choice is to leverage the users’ biometrics; however, it either relies on highly advanced equipments which may not always be available in commercial headsets or introduce heavy cognitive load to users. In this paper, we propose a vibration-based authentication scheme, VibHead, for smart headsets. Since the propagation of vibration signals through human heads presents unique patterns for different individuals, VibHead employs a CNN-based model to classify registered legitimate users based the features extracted from the vibration signals. We also design a two-step authentication scheme where the above user classifiers are utilized to distinguish the legitimate user from illegitimate ones. We implement VibHead on a Microsoft HoloLens equipped with a linear motor and an IMU sensor which are commonly used in off-the-shelf personal smart devices. According to the results of our extensive experiments, with short vibration signals (≤ 1s ), VibHead has an outstanding authentication accuracy; both FAR and FRR are around 5%.",

While capable of achieving accurate identification in a single domain (i.e., training and testing in the same consistent WiFi environment), it would become extremely tough when WiFi environments change significantly. As such, domain adversarial neural networks-based approaches have been proposed to handle such diversities across domains, yet often found to share the same limitation in practice: the imbalance between high-capacity of feature extractors and data insufficiency of source domains. This article proposes i-Sample, an intermediate sample generation-based framework, striving to tackle this issue for WiFi-based HAR. i-Sample is mainly designed as two-stage training, where four data augmentation operations are proposed to train a coarse domain-invariant feature extractor in the first stage. In the second stage, we leverage the gradients of classification error to generate intermediate samples to refine the classifiers together with original samples, making i-Sample also capable to be integrated into most domain adversarial adaptation methods without neural network modification. We have implemented a prototype system to evaluate i-Sample, which shows that i-Sample can effectively augment the performance of nowadays mainstream domain adversarial adaptation models for WiFi-based HAR, especially when source domain data is insufficient.",

Three key issues are addressed: camera direction selection, location selection, and moving object monitoring. There are three steps to maximize coverage of moving targets. The first step involves proposing the Maximum Group Set Coverage (MGSC) algorithm, which selects the camera sensor direction for traditional target coverage. In the second step, a composed target merged from a set of fixed directional targets represents multiple views of a moving object. Building upon the MGSC algorithm, the Maximum Group Set Coverage with Composed Targets (MGSC-CT) algorithm is presented to determine camera sensor directions that cover subsets of fixed directional targets. Additionally, a constraint on the number of cameras is imposed for camera location selection, leading to the study of the Maximum Group Set Coverage with Size Constraint (MGSC-SC) algorithm. Each of these steps formulates a problem on group set coverage and provides an algorithmic solution. Furthermore, improved versions of MGSC-CT and MGSC-SC are developed to enhance the coverage speed.

Easy accessibility of networks and nodes and almost no physical protection against corruptions raise high security challenges. Protection against attacks aiming to falsify the aggregated result is considered to be of prime importance. In this article we design the first general framework for secure information aggregation in WSNs focusing on scenarios where aggregation is performed by one of its nodes.

However, developing embedded communication systems that satisfy specific application requirements is a challenge due to the many tradeoffs imposed by different choices of underlying protocols and their parameters. Furthermore, evaluating the correctness and performance of the design and implementation before deploying it is a nontrivial task due to the complexity of the resulting system. This article presents the design and implementation of RaPTEX, a rapid prototyping tool for embedded communication systems, especially well suited for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), consisting of three major subsystems: a toolbox, an analytical performance estimation framework, and an emulation environment. We use a hierarchical approach in the design of the toolbox to facilitate the composition of the network stack. For fast exploration of the tradeoff space at design time, we build an analytical performance estimation model for energy consumption, delay, and throughput. For realistic performance evaluation, we design and implement a hybrid, accurate, yet scalable, emulation environment. Through three use cases, we study the tradeoff space for different protocols and topologies, and highlight the benefits of using RaPTEX for designing and evaluating embedded communication systems for WSNs.",

    "abstract": "Coverage estimation is one of the fundamental problems in sensor networks. Coverage estimation in visual sensor networks (VSNs) is more challenging than in conventional 1-D (omnidirectional) scalar sensor networks (SSNs) because of the directional sensing nature of cameras and the existence of visual occlusion in crowded environments. This article represents a first attempt toward a closed-form solution for the visual coverage estimation problem in the presence of occlusions. We investigate a new target detection model, referred to as the certainty-based target detection (as compared to the traditional uncertainty-based target detection ) to facilitate the formulation of the visual coverage problem. We then derive the closed-form solution for the estimation of the visual coverage probability based on this new target detection model that takes visual occlusions into account. According to the coverage estimation model, we further propose an estimate of the minimum sensor density that suffices to ensure a visual K-coverage in a crowded sensing field. Simulation is conducted which shows extreme consistency with results from theoretical formulation, especially when the boundary effect is considered. Thus, the closed-form solution for visual coverage estimation is effective when applied to real scenarios, such as efficient sensor deployment and optimal sleep scheduling.",

We considered a receiver-initiated MAC method for WSNs in which the sender waits for a beacon signal from the receiver before starting to transmit. Since each sender receives beacon signals from several nodes, the data are routed on multiple paths in a data collection network. In this context, we propose an optimization framework for minimizing the energy waste of the most power-hungry node of the network. To this aim, we first derive an analytic model that predicts nodes' energy consumption. Then, we use the model to derive a distributed optimization technique.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture evolution using a wireless network of in-situ underground sensors. To reduce cost and prolong lifetime, it is highly desirable to rely on fewer measurements and estimate with higher accuracy the original signal (the temporal evolution of soil moisture). In this article, we explore the use of results from the theory of sparse sampling, including Compressive Sensing (CS) and Matrix Completion (MC), in this application context. We first consider the problem of reconstructing the soil moisture process at a single location using CS. Our physical constraint leads to very sparse measurement matrices, which makes finding a suitable representation basis very challenging: it needs to make the underlying signal sufficiently sparse while at the same time being sufficiently incoherent with the measurement matrix, two common preconditions for CS techniques to work well. We construct a representation basis by exploiting unique features of soil moisture evolution and show that this basis attains a very good tradeoff between its ability to sparsify the signal and its incoherence with measurement matrices that are consistent with our physical constraints. We next consider the problem of jointly reconstructing soil moisture processes at multiple locations, assuming sparse measurements can be taken at each location. We show that the spatial soil moisture process enjoys a low-rank property, a priority for MC. Accordingly, we introduce a spatiotemporal measurement matrix and apply the MC framework to reconstruct the soil moisture field. Extensive numerical evaluation is performed on both real, high-resolution soil moisture data and simulated data and through comparison with a closed-loop scheduling approach. Our results demonstrate that, for a single location, a uniform measurement scheduling followed by CS recovery results in a very nice tradeoff between estimation accuracy, sampling rate, flexibility, and feasibility in implementation. When multiple locations are available, our results show that joint reconstruction using MC in general produces better estimation accuracy than using a single location alone, but it requires the use of independent and random measurement schedules across locations. We also show that these sparse sampling techniques can be augmented so as to be robust against sporadic data outliers/corruption caused by, for example, intermittent sensor faults.",

    "abstract": "We explore the use of cooperative multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications to prolong the lifetime of a wireless sensor network (WSN). Single-antenna sensor nodes are clustered into virtual antenna arrays that can act as virtual MIMO (VMIMO) nodes. We design a distributed cooperative clustering protocol (CCP), which exploits VMIMO's diversity gain by optimally selecting the cooperating nodes (CNs) within each cluster and balancing their energy consumption. The problem of optimal CN selection at the transmit and receive clusters is formulated as a nonlinear binary program. Aiming at minimizing the imbalance in the residual energy at various nodes, we decompose this problem into two subproblems: finding the optimal number of CNs (ONC) in a cluster and the CN assignment problem. For the ONC problem, we first analyze the energy efficiency of two widely used VMIMO methods: distributed Space Time Block Code (DSTBC) and distributed Vertical-Bell Laboratories-Layered-Space-Time (DVBLAST). Our analysis provides an upper bound on the optimal number of CN nodes, which greatly reduces the computational complexity of the ONC problem. The second subproblem is addressed by assigning CNs based on the residual battery energy. To make CCP scalable to large WSNs, we propose a multihop energy-balanced routing mechanism for clustered WSNs (C-EBR) with a novel cost metric. Finally, we derive sufficient conditions on the intra- and intercluster ranges, under which CCP guarantees connectivity of the intercluster topology. Extensive simulations show that the proposed approach dramatically improves the network lifetime.",

Our framework sheds new light into the design of pragmatic schemes for the control of energy-harvesting sensor networks and permits to gauge the impact of key sensor network parameters, such as the battery capacity, the harvester size, the information transmission rate, and the radio duty cycle. We analyze the robustness of the obtained energy management policies in the cases where the nodes have differing energy inflow statistics and where topology changes may occur, devising effective heuristics.

    "abstract": "A conventional wireless sensor network node consists of a number of components: microprocessor, memory, sensor, and radio. Advances in nanotechnology have enabled the miniaturization of these components, thus enabling wireless nanoscale sensor networks (WNSN). Due to their small size, WNSN nodes are expected to be powered by harvesting energy from the environment. Unfortunately, there is a mismatch in the energy that can be harvested and the energy required to power all the aforementioned components in a WNSN node. In this article, we propose a simplified sensor node architecture for event detection. We call our architecture Sensorless Event MONitoring in self-powered WNSNs (SEMON). A SEMON node consists of only an energy harvester and a radio with minimal processing capacity. We assume that each event to be monitored will generate a different amount of energy, and we can therefore use this amount of energy as the signature of an event. When an event occurs, a SEMON node harvests the energy released by the event and turns it into a radio pulse with an amplitude proportional to the harvested energy. A remote station is used to decode the amplitude of the pulse to recognize the event that has occurred. We propose two methods for the remote station to decode the events that have occurred. The first method is based on thresholds. The second method makes use of an event model that gives the probability that a sequence of events will occur. This enables us to formulate the decoding problem using Hidden Markov Models. We study the decoding performance of both methods. Finally, we provide a case study on using the SEMON architecture to monitor the chemical reactions inside a reactor.",

Because link qualities are not predictable prior to deployment, current deterministic solutions to unreliable links, such as increasing network density or transmission power, require overprovisioning of network resources and do not always improve reliability. We propose a new dual-radio network architecture to improve communication reliability in wireless sensor networks. Specifically, we show that radio transceivers operating at well-separated frequencies and spatially separated antennas offer robust communication, high link diversity, and better interference mitigation. We derive the optimal parameters for the dual-transceiver setup from frequency and space diversity in theory. We observe that frequency diversity holds the most benefits as long as the antennas are sufficiently separated to prevent coupling. Our experiments on an indoor/outdoor testbed confirm the theoretical predictions and show that radio diversity can significantly improve end-to-end delivery rates and network stability at only a small increase in energy cost over a single radio. Simulation experiments further validate the improvements in multiple topology configurations, but also reveal that the benefits of radio diversity are coupled to the number of available routing paths to the destination.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are often deployed in large numbers, over a large geographical region, in order to monitor the phenomena of interest. Sensors used in the sensor networks often suffer from random or systematic errors such as drift and bias. Even if they are calibrated at the time of deployment, they tend to drift as time progresses. Consequently, the progressive manual calibration of such a large-scale sensor network becomes impossible in practice. In this article, we address this challenge by proposing a collaborative framework to automatically detect and correct the drift in order to keep the data collected from these networks reliable. We propose a novel scheme that uses geospatial estimation-based interpolation techniques on measurements from neighboring sensors to collaboratively predict the value of phenomenon being observed. The predicted values are then used iteratively to correct the sensor drift by means of a Kalman filter. Our scheme can be implemented in a centralized as well as distributed manner to detect and correct the drift generated in the sensors. For centralized implementation of our scheme, we compare several kriging- and nonkriging-based geospatial estimation techniques in combination with the Kalman filter, and show the superiority of the kriging-based methods in detecting and correcting the drift. To demonstrate the applicability of our distributed approach on a real world application scenario, we implement our algorithm on a network consisting of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) hardware. We further evaluate single as well as multiple drifting sensor scenarios to show the effectiveness of our algorithm for detecting and correcting drift. Further, we address the issue of high power usage for data transmission among neighboring nodes leading to low network lifetime for the distributed approach by proposing two power saving schemes. Moreover, we compare our algorithm with a blind calibration scheme in the literature and demonstrate its superiority in detecting both linear and nonlinear drifts.",

We consider mixed WSNs that consist of sparse static sensor deployments and mobile sensors that move continuously to monitor uncovered (vacant) areas in the sensor field. Mobile sensors move autonomously and cooperatively by executing a path planning algorithm. Using a simplified scenario, the article derives the optimal path strategy for a single mobile sensor to search two nonconnected uncovered regions with the minimum average detection delay or with the maximum dynamic coverage. The resulting optimal strategy confirms that it is better to search areas that are less likely to hide a target but are located closer to the mobile node, rather than heading toward the most likely area. Based on the insights gained from the simplified scenario and the theory of coverage processes, the article proposes a surrogate method to approximate the best searching neighborhood radius (a design parameter of the path planning algorithm) that optimizes the dynamic coverage and event detection time capabilities of mixed WSN deployments. Extensive simulation results indicate that this approach can achieve very good results, both for a single and for multiple collaborating mobile sensors.",

The recent revolution in big data and Internet-of-Things (IoT) provides unprecedented benefits including optimizing yield, minimizing environmental impact, and reducing cost. However, the mass collection of farm data in IoT applications raises serious concerns about potential privacy leakage that may harm the farmers’ welfare. In this work, we propose a novel scalable and private geo-distance evaluation system, called SPRIDE, to allow application servers to provide geographic-based services by computing the distances among sensors and farms privately. The servers determine the distances without learning any additional information about their locations. The key idea of SPRIDE is to perform efficient distance measurement and distance comparison on encrypted locations over a sphere by leveraging a homomorphic cryptosystem. To serve a large user base, we further propose SPRIDE+ with novel and practical performance enhancements based on pre-computation of cryptographic elements. Through extensive experiments using real-world datasets, we show SPRIDE+ achieves private distance evaluation on a large network of farms, attaining 3+ times runtime performance improvement over existing techniques. We further show SPRIDE+ can run on resource-constrained mobile devices, which offers a practical solution for privacy-preserving precision agriculture IoT applications.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based visual sensing has achieved attractive accuracy but is shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Specifically, once the attackers obtain the deep model, they can construct adversarial examples to mislead the model to yield wrong classification results. Deployable adversarial examples such as small stickers pasted on the road signs and lanes have been shown effective in misleading advanced driver-assistance systems. Most existing countermeasures against adversarial examples build their security on the attackers’ ignorance of the defense mechanisms. Thus, they fall short of following Kerckhoffs’s principle and can be subverted once the attackers know the details of the defense. This article applies the strategy of moving target defense (MTD) to generate multiple new deep models after system deployment that will collaboratively detect and thwart adversarial examples. Our MTD design is based on the adversarial examples’ minor transferability across different models. The post-deployment of dynamically generated models significantly increase the bar of successful attacks. We also apply serial data fusion with early stopping to reduce the inference time by a factor of up to 5, as well as exploit hardware inference accelerators’ characteristics to strike better tradeoffs between inference time and power consumption. Evaluation based on three datasets including a road sign dataset and two GPU-equipped embedded computing boards shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in counteracting the attack.",

Existing works on network classification are limited by their application-centric nature, thus overlooking the key criterion for real-time IoT applications, namely, Quality of Service ( QoS ). In this article, we focus on augmenting SDN controllers’ decision-making capacity and Underwater Sensor Networks with machine learning algorithms to achieve real-time, QoS-aware, network traffic classification. Three classifiers, namely, Feed-forward Neural Network, Naïve Bayes, and Logistics Regression have been employed with a novel Artificial Neural Network and Particle Swarm Optimization hybridization scheme by carrying first- and second-order stability analysis for performance improvement of these classifiers. In short, the proposed framework exploits optimization algorithms and semi-supervised machine learning ( ML ) for precise traffic classification while keeping communication overhead between controller and switches minimal. Results obtained from real-life datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed scheme.",

However, in this model, the problem of secure data transmission has not been solved. In this model, data is transmitted and forwarded in multiple messaging systems, and existing security schemes cannot achieve end-to-end security in a multi-hop, broadcast transmission model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new security scheme based on proxy re-encryption and broadcast encryption techniques. Moreover, the performance and security of the scheme are further enhanced by using online-offline techniques and a trusted execution environment when integrating the scheme with edge collaboration. Finally, this paper proves the security of the scheme in theory, compares the functionality of the scheme, analyzes the theoretical performance of the scheme, and finally measures the actual performance of the scheme in the edge collaboration system.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks have enabled smart infrastructures and novel applications. With the recent roll-out of Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) cellular radio technology, wireless sensors can be widely deployed for data collection in cities around the world. However, empirical evidence regarding the coverage and connectivity of NB-IoT in dense urban areas is limited. This article presents an empirical study that focuses on evaluating the coverage and connectivity of NB-IoT in a dense urban environment. We have designed an NB-IoT sensor node and deployed over 100 of them in high-rise apartment buildings in Hong Kong. These sensor nodes utilize a commercial NB-IoT network to collect high-resolution water flow data for machine learning model training and provide timely feedback to users. We collect and analyze the empirical NB-IoT signal measurements from the sensor nodes deployed in various challenging outdoor and indoor environments for over three months. These empirical measurements reveal correlations between NB-IoT connectivity and sensor installation environments. We also observe that inter-cell interference, as a result of coverage by multiple neighboring NB-IoT cells in a dense urban environment, is a source of connectivity degradation. We discuss potential issues that IoT application designers and system integrators might encounter in practical NB-IoT devices deployment, and we propose a transmission decision algorithm based on signal measurements for mitigating energy wasted due to transmission failures. Finally, we demonstrate the results and the benefits of using high-resolution water flow data collected by our purpose-built NB-IoT sensor nodes for studying the patterns of domestic water consumption in Hong Kong.",

It has been widely used in industries such as the energy industry, chemical engineering, self-driving, and so on. While transporting important messages, MQTT specification recommends the use of TLS protocol. However, the computation cost of TLS is too heavy. Since topics in a broker are stored with a hierarchical structure, in this manuscript, we propose a novel data protection protocol for MQTT from hierarchical ID-based encryption. Our protocol adopts the intrinsic hierarchical structures of MQTT, and achieves constant-size keys, i.e., independent of the depth in hierarchical structures. Besides, the formal security model for the proposed protocol have been defined in the manuscript. The proposed protocol have been formally proven chosen-plaintext secure under the ℓ-wBDHI assumption.",

    "abstract": "Smart agriculture which integrates the agriculture with Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted attention since it contributes to increase the productivity and quality of crops, reduce energy consumption and facilitate the farmers. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are two most commonly deployed devices that are used for enabling the smart agriculture. In this paper, we design a collaborative WSN-UAV system, wherein different clusters of sensor nodes form different sensor-based virtual antenna arrays (SVAAs) to transmit the collected data towards different receiver UAVs via adopting collaborative beamforming (CB), then the receiver UAVs will take the collected data back to the ground control station (GCS). We formulate a transmission rate and battery energy bi-objective optimization problem (TRBEBOP) to simultaneously maximize the total transmission rate of the sensor-based CB clusters and the total remaining battery energy of the selected sensor nodes, by selecting appropriate sensor nodes in each cluster that can form a predominant SVAA, determining suitable receiver UAVs and optimizing the excitation current weights of the selected sensor nodes. To handle the formulated TRBEBOP that is demonstrated to be non-convex and NP-hard, an enhanced non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (ENSGA-II) with several specific designs is presented. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed ENSGA-II for solving the formulated TRBEBOP. Moreover, compared with other benchmark algorithms, the superiority of the proposed ENSGA-II is demonstrated. In addition, the impacts of several fortuitous circumstances on the system are estimated, and the results illustrate the robustness of the proposed scheme. Finally, the discussion about several mechanisms to deal with the interference induced by the sidelobe levels and the impact of UAV movement on receiving rate are provided.",

In this article, we study a fundamental issue of W ireless ch A rger placement w I th obs T acles (WAIT), that is, how to place wireless chargers by comprehensively considering these parameters of obstacles, such that the overall charging utility is maximized. To tackle the WAIT problem, we first build a practical charging model with obstacles by introducing shadow fading, and conduct experiments to verify its correctness. Then, we design a piecewise constant function to approximate the nonlinear charging power. Afterwards, we develop a Dominating Coverage Set extraction algorithm to reduce the continuous solution space to a limited number. Finally, we prove the WAIT problem is a maximizing monotone submodular function problem, and propose a 1-1/e-ε approximation algorithm to address it. Extensive simulations and field experiments show that our scheme outperforms comparison algorithms by at least 20.6% in charging utility improvement.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where multiple worker devices collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server, while keeping the training data local. However, owing to the lack of supervision on worker devices, FL is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks where the worker devices controlled by an adversary arbitrarily generate poisoned local models and send to FL server, ultimately degrading the utility (e.g., model accuracy) of the global model. Most of existing Byzantine-robust algorithms, however, cannot well react to the threatening Byzantine attacks when the ratio of compromised worker devices (i.e., Byzantine ratio) is over 0.5 and worker devices’ local training datasets are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID). We propose a novel Byzantine-robust Fed erated Learning under Super vision (FedSuper), which can maintain robustness against Byzantine attacks even in the threatening scenario with a very high Byzantine ratio (0.9 in our experiments) and the largest level of non-IID data (1.0 in our experiments) when the state-of-the-art Byzantine attacks are conducted. The main idea of FedSuper is that the FL server supervises worker devices via injecting a shadow dataset into their local training processes. Moreover, according to the local models’ accuracies or losses on the shadow dataset, we design a Local Model Filter to remove poisoned local models and output an optimal global model. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the superior performance of FedSuper, compared to five latest Byzantine-robust FL algorithms and two baselines, in defending against two state-of-the-art Byzantine attacks with high Byzantine ratios and high levels of non-IID data.",

However, we find that the temperature of the RF front end in smartphones can significantly impact the RF features, including the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and statistical RF features. The unstable RF features caused by temperature changes can negatively affect the performance of state-of-the-art RFFI approaches. To this end, we propose the RF-TESI solution for smartphone identification under temperature variation. First, we construct a dataset by extracting temperature and RF features. In the dataset, the extracted temperature values constitute a set of temperature values and each registered temperature value corresponds to a group of RF features. Next, we evaluate the distinctiveness of RF features across smartphones to select the most suitable RF fingerprint. Then, we train multiple random forest models, each tagged with a registered temperature. In addition, because there are still many temperatures out of the temperature set, we design an RF fingerprint estimation method to estimate RF fingerprints at unregistered temperatures. Finally, the experiments show RF-TESI demonstrates satisfactory performance under different scenarios, taking into account variations in temperature, time and position. Besides, our proposed approach is better than all state-of-the-art approaches in smartphone identification.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of smart devices spurs the development of emerging indoor localization technologies for supporting diverse personalized applications at home. Given marked drawbacks of popular chirp signal-based approaches, we aim at developing a novel device-free localization system via the continuous wave of the inaudible frequency. To achieve this goal, solutions are developed for fine-grained analyses, able to precisely locate moving human traces in the room-scale environment. In particular, a smart speaker is controlled to emit continuous waves at inaudible 20kHz , with a co-located microphone array to record their Doppler reflections for localization. We first develop solutions to remove potential noises and then propose a novel idea by slicing signals into a set of narrowband signals, each of which is likely to include at most one body segment’s reflection. Different from previous studies, which take original signals themselves as the baseband, our solutions employ the Doppler frequency of a narrowband signal to estimate the velocity first and apply it to get the accurate baseband frequency, which permits a precise phase measurement after I-Q (i.e., in-phase and quadrature) decomposition. A signal model is then developed, able to formulate the phase with body segment’s velocity, range, and angle. We next develop novel solutions to estimate the motion state in each narrowband signal, cluster the motion states for different body segments corresponding to the same person, and locate the moving traces while mitigating multi-path effects. Our system is implemented with commodity devices in room environments for performance evaluation. The experimental results exhibit that our system can conduct effective localization for up to three persons in a room, with the average errors of 7.49 cm for a single person, with 24.06 cm for two persons, with 51.15 cm for three persons.",

Additionally, given the fixed time and monetary costs for the participants, they typically only perform a subset of tasks.

Current truth discovery methods struggle to adapt to datasets with varying sparsity, especially when dealing with sparse datasets.

Batteryless devices that operate entirely on harvested energy often experience frequent, unpredictable power outages and have trouble keeping time accurately. Consequently, effective communication using today’s low-power wireless network standards and protocols becomes difficult, particularly because existing standards are usually designed to support reliably powered devices with predictable node availability and accurate timekeeping capabilities for connection and congestion management. In this article, we present Greentooth, a robust and energy-efficient wireless communication protocol for intermittently powered sensor networks. It enables reliable communication between a receiver and multiple batteryless sensors using Time Division Multiple Access–style scheduling and low-power wake-up radios for synchronization. Greentooth employs lightweight and energy-efficient connections that are resilient to transient power outages, while significantly improving network reliability, throughput, and energy efficiency of both the battery-free sensor nodes and the receiver—which could be untethered and energy constrained. We evaluate Greentooth using a custom-built batteryless sensor prototype on synthetic and real-world energy traces recorded from different locations in a garden across different times of the day. Results show that Greentooth achieves 73% and 283% more throughput compared to Asynchronous Wake-up on Demand MAC and Receiver-Initiated Consecutive Packet Transmission Wake-up Radios, respectively, under intermittent ambient solar energy and over 2× longer receiver lifetime.",

The nets help in reducing pest damage, but they also constrain the drone’s flight path, making it longer and more complex. To address this issue, we model the orchard as an aisle-graph, a regular data structure that represents consecutive aisles where trees are arranged in straight lines. The drone flies close to the trees and takes pictures at specific positions for monitoring the presence of bugs, but its energy is limited, so it can only visit a subset of positions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the Single-drone Orienteering Aisle-graph Problem (SOAP), a variant of the orienteering problem, where likely infested locations are prioritized by assigning them a larger profit. Additionally, the drone’s movements have a cost in terms of energy, and the objective is to plan a drone’s route in the most profitable locations under a given drone’s battery. We show that SOAP can be optimally solved in polynomial time, but for larger orchards/instances, we propose faster approximation and heuristic algorithms.

To provide seamless interactions between the cyber world and the real world, Digital twins (DTs) of objects (IoT devices) are key enablers for real time monitoring, behaviour simulations, and predictive decisions on objects. Compared to centralized cloud computing, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been envisioning as a promising paradigm for low latency IoT applications. Accelerating the usage of DTs in MEC networks will bring unprecedented benefits to diverse services, through the co-evolution between physical objects and their virtual DTs, and DT-assisted service provisioning has attracted increasing attention recently. In this article, we consider novel DT placement and migration problems in an MEC network with the mobility assumption of objects and users, by jointly considering the freshness of DT data and the service cost of users requesting for DT data. To this end, we first propose an algorithm for the DT placement problem with the aim to minimize the sum of the DT update cost of objects and the total service cost of users requesting for DT data, through efficient DT placements and resource allocation to process user requests. We then devise an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for a special case of the DT placement problem when each user requests the DT data of only one object. Meanwhile, considering the mobility of users and objects, we devise an online, two-layer scheduling algorithm for DT migrations to further reduce the total service cost of users within a given finite time horizon. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are promising.",

This article describes a novel approach to multi-sensor hybrid coupled cooperative localization network (HCCNet) system that combines multiple types of sensors including camera, ultra-wideband (UWB), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) to address this challenge. The camera and IMU can automatically determine the position of UAV based on the perception of surrounding environments and their own measurement data. The UWB node and the UWB wireless sensor network (WSN) in indoor environments jointly determine the global position of UAV, and the proposed dynamic random sample consensus (D-RANSAC) algorithm can optimize UWB localization accuracy. To fully exploit UWB localization results, we provide an HCCNet system which combines the local pose estimator of visual inertial odometry (VIO) system with global constraints from UWB localization results. Experimental results show that the proposed D-RANSAC algorithm can achieve better accuracy than other UWB-based algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed HCCNet method is verified by a mobile robot in real world and some simulation experiments in indoor environments.",

However, classic FL methods are susceptible to model poisoning attacks and Byzantine failures. Despite several defense methods proposed to mitigate such concerns, it is challenging to balance adverse effects while allowing that each credible node contributes to the learning process. To this end, a Fair and Robust FL method is proposed for defense against model poisoning attack from malicious nodes, namely FRFL. FRFL can learn a high-quality model even if some nodes are malicious. In particular, we first classify each participant into three categories: training node, validation node, and blockchain node. Among these, blockchain nodes replace the central server in classic FL methods while enabling secure aggregation. Then, a fairness-aware role rotation method is proposed to periodically alter the sets of training and validation nodes in order to utilize the valuable information included in local datasets of credible nodes. Finally, a decentralized and adaptive aggregation mechanism cooperating with blockchain nodes is designed to detect and discard malicious nodes and produce a high-quality model. The results show the effectiveness of FRFL in enhancing model performance while defending against malicious nodes.",

This is primarily due to the limited availability of ground infrastructure that is bulky to deploy and expensive to rent. This article explores the opportunity in leveraging the extensive terrestrial LoRa infrastructure as a solution. However, the limited bandwidth and large amount of Doppler on CubeSats precludes these LoRa links to communicate rich satellite Earth images—instead, the CubeSats can at best send short messages. This article details our experience in designing LoRa-based satellite ground infrastructure that requires software-only modifications to receive packets from LoRa-enabled CubeSats recently launched by our team. We present Vista, a communication system that adapts encoding onboard the CubeSat and decoding configuration on commercial LoRa ground stations to allow images to be communicated. We perform a detailed evaluation of Vista by leveraging wireless channel measurements from a recent CubeSat (2021), and show that Vista can achieve 55.55% lower latency in retrieving data with 12.02 dB improvement in packet retrieval in the presence of terrestrial interference. We then evaluate Vista on a case study on land-use classification over images transmitted over the CubeSat link to further demonstrate a 4.56 dB improvement in image PSNR and 1.38× increase in classification accuracy over baseline approaches.",

    "abstract": "The respiration state during overnight sleep is an important indicator of human health. However, existing contactless solutions for sleep respiration monitoring either perform in controlled environments and have low usability in practical scenarios or only provide coarse-grained respiration rates, being unable to accurately detect abnormal events in patients. In this article, we propose Respnea, a non-intrusive sleep respiration monitoring system using an ultra-wideband device. Particularly, we propose a profiling algorithm, which can locate the sleep positions in non-controlled environments and identify different subject states. Further, we construct a deep learning model that adopts a multi-head self-attention mechanism and learns the patterns implicit in the respiration signals to distinguish sleep respiration events at a granularity of seconds. To improve the generalization of the model, we propose a contrastive learning strategy to learn a robust representation of the respiration signals. We deploy our system in hospital and home scenarios and conduct experiments on data from healthy subjects and patients with sleep disorders. The experimental results show that Respnea achieves high temporal coverage and low errors (a median error of 0.27 bpm) in respiration rate estimation and reaches an accuracy of 94.44% on diagnosing the severity of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is an emerging application paradigm of edge computing in smart cities. On the one hand, it enables efficient, private, and secure processing of sensitive data. On the other hand, it alleviates the burden of centralized data processing for the smart city. However, in real-world scenarios, performance degradation caused by domain adaptation has become a bottleneck that limits the widespread application of federated learning. Most existing approaches tackle the issue by designing novel local learning approaches to transfer knowledge among different domains while ignoring the optimization for global model aggregation. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages the label-free adversarial learning technique to evaluate the representations learned by the different domains under the global model. With the constraints of the federated setting, we minimize the discrepancy by aligning each distribution to the global distribution. Additionally, we have developed a fast detector to enhance the quality of the generated images. Through extensive experiments on image classification tasks, we have demonstrated promising results and shown that our approach can serve as a robust plugin for other local optimizers in Federated Learning.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) leveraging millimeter wave (mmWave) communication for bandwidth-demanding applications is considered in this paper. Despite the large bandwidth, the delivery of delay-sensitive information collected by sensors may still face significant latency due to the vulnerability to intermittent link blockage. Hence, the guarantee of low age of information (AoI) in mmWave WSNs is not straightforward. In this paper, the wireless sensing and dynamic programming techniques are jointly exploited to relieve the above issue. The former tracks the human blockers and predicts the chance of link blockage; the latter optimizes the transmission of multiple sensors based on the prediction. Particularly, the long-term optimization of sampling, uplink time and power allocation policies in a sensor network can be formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with discounted cost, where the state transition probabilities can be predicted via wireless sensing. A novel low-complexity solution framework, namely COSMO, with a guaranteed performance in the worst case, is proposed. Simulations show that compared with heuristic benchmarks, benefiting from the prediction of the link blockage, COSMO can significantly suppress the average system cost, which consists of both AoI and energy consumption.",

In this article, we propose a novel methodology for trading energy versus latency in sensor database systems. We propose a new protocol that carefully schedules message transmissions so as to avoid collisions at the MAC layer. Since all nodes adhere to the schedule, their radios can be off most of the time and only wake up during well-defined time intervals. We show how routing protocols can be optimized to interact symbiotically with scheduling decisions, resulting in significant energy savings at the cost of higher latency.

Almost all previous spanner constructions for ad hoc networks assumed that all nodes in the network have the same transmission range. This allowed a succinct representation of the network as a unit disk graph, serving as the basis for the construction. In contrast, when nodes have variable transmission range, the ad hoc network must be modeled by a general disk graph. Whereas unit disk graphs are undirected, general disk graphs are directed. This complicates the construction of a spanner for the network, since currently there are no efficient constructions of low-stretch spanners for general directed graphs. Nevertheless, in this article it is shown that the class of disk graphs enjoys (efficiently constructible) spanners of quality similar to that of unit disk graph spanners. Moreover, it is shown that the new construction can be performed in a localized fashion. Our results use only simple packing arguments, hence all algorithms work for every metric space of constant doubling dimension.",

As more and more sensors fail, certain desired properties such as barrier coverage will diminish and eventually fall below a desired level. In such a case, the network will have to be repaired. It is therefore desirable to have mechanisms to monitor network properties. In this article, we are interested in measuring the quality of barrier coverage, which is known to be an appropriate model of coverage for movement detection applications such as intrusion detection. In the literature, researchers only consider whether or not a sensor network provides barrier coverage. This is equivalent to measuring its quality as either 0 or 1. We believe quality of barrier coverage is not binary and propose a metric for measuring it. If the measured quality is short of a desired value, we further identify all local regions that need to be repaired. The identified regions are minimal in the sense that if one of them is not repaired then the resulting network will still be short of quality. We also discuss how to actually repair a region.",

It can be reduced through Low-Power Listening (LPL) techniques in which a node is allowed to sleep for a significant amount of time. In contrast to conventional fixed sleep time policies, we introduce a novel dynamic sleep time control approach that further reduces control packet energy waste by utilizing known data traffic statistics. We propose two distinct approaches to dynamically compute the sleep time, depending on the objectives and constraints of the network. The first approach provides a dynamic sleep time policy that guarantees a specified average delay at the sender node resulting from packets waiting for the end of a sleep interval at the receiver. The second approach determines the optimal policy that minimizes total energy consumed. In the case where data traffic statistics are unknown, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm to estimate them online and develop corresponding sleep time computation algorithms. Simulation results are included to illustrate the use of dynamic sleep time control and to demonstrate how it dominates fixed sleep time methods. An implementation of our approach on a commercial sensor node supports the computational feasibility of the proposed approach.",

In this scheme, the cameras and the sensors are equipped with controllable light sources (either visible or infrared), which are used for signaling. Each camera node can then determine automatically the bearing to all of the nodes that are visible from its vantage point. By fusing these measurements with the measurements obtained from onboard accelerometers, the camera nodes are able to determine the relative positions and orientations of other nodes in the network. The method uses angular measurements derived from images, rather than range measurements derived from time-of-flight or signal attenuation. The scheme can be implemented relatively easily with commonly available components, and it scales well since the localization calculations exploit the sparse structure of the system of measurements. Additionally, the method provides estimates of camera orientation which cannot be determined solely from range measurements. The localization technology could serve as a basic capability on which higher-level applications could be built. The method could also be used to automatically survey the locations of sensors of interest, to implement distributed surveillance systems, or to analyze the structure of a scene, based on images obtained from multiple registered vantage points. It also provides a mechanism for integrating the imagery obtained from the cameras with the measurements obtained from distributed sensors.",

We follow a hybrid hardware-software approach for acoustic ranging or radio interferometry to acquire internode distance measurements, and a resilient self-localization algorithm to compute the node location estimates. The acoustic ranging method improves on previous work, extending the practical measurement range up to 35 m in grassy outdoor environments, achieving a distance-invariant median measurement error of about 1% (33 cm). The localization algorithm is based on least-squares scaling with soft constraints. Empirical evaluation using ranging results obtained from sensor network field experiments and simulations confirms that our approach is more resilient than multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithms against large-magnitude ranging errors and sparse range measurements: conditions that are common in large-scale outdoor sensor network deployments.",

On the other hand, wireless sensors are usually battery powered, and thus it is very important to save energy in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this article, we propose (1) Sleeping Multipath Routing, which can trade off reliability and network lifetime by dynamically activating an optimal number of paths to support the application's reliability requirement and putting the rest of the sensors to sleep, and (2) an adaptive sensor sleeping solution, which includes Sleeping Multipath Routing, a duty-cycled MAC protocol, and cross-layer coordination to further prolong the network lifetime by putting sensors to sleep at both the routing and the MAC layers. Our proposed Sleeping Multipath Routing and adaptive sensor sleeping solution can be implemented on any multipath routing protocol that discovers multiple disjoint paths between two nodes, and any duty-cycled MAC protocol that has fixed cycle length. We show an example of implementing our adaptive sensor sleeping solution using Directed Diffusion and S-MAC. Simulation results show that our proposed adaptive sensor sleeping solution outperforms single-layer sensor sleeping with a longer network lifetime with required reliability support. Moreover, our proposed adaptive sensor sleeping solution can significantly prolong the network lifetime when the application's reliability requirement varies over time, or when the number of alive nodes in the network changes over time.",

A novel scheme is proposed that uses dithered quantization and channel compensation to ensure that each sensor's local estimate received by the CH is unbiased. The CH fuses these unbiased local estimates into a global one, using a best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve much smaller mean square error (MSE) than two other common schemes, while using the same amount of energy. The sensitivity of the proposed scheme to errors in estimates of the crossover probability of the BSC channel is studied by both analysis and simulation.

    "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks, different applications feature different requirements in terms of such performance metrics as sensing coverage and data reporting latency. In most applications, it is usually sufficient to provide a Desired Sensing Coverage (DSC) lower than full coverage at any instance with the guarantee that the whole area will eventually be covered within a specified delay bound. Due to the fact that these applications are also expected to run for longer periods of time and at the same time battery recharging and replacement are costly, energy consumption in wireless sensor networks should be minimized while achieving the application goals. In this article, we propose a novel framework for application-specific data gathering which exploits a trade-off between coverage and latency, thereby minimizing energy consumption and extending the network lifetime. The proposed energy-efficient, constant-time, randomized scheme, called Coverage-Adaptive raNdom SEnsor sElection (CANSEE), selects a subset of k sensors to report at each round so as to fulfill the application-specific requirement of desired sensing coverage and bounded latency, instead of always guaranteeing full coverage and minimum latency. We present a probabilistic model to estimate: (i) the connectivity of those selected k sensors and the number of additional sensors needed to guarantee connectivity; (ii) a lower bound on k in each round; and (iii) the probability of almost surely having k data reporters using the Chernoff bound. The immediate event detection capability achieved by the proposed CANSEE scheme is also analyzed to compare the performance of our framework with other data gathering schemes that allow 100% coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework leads to a significant conservation of energy (and thus extended network lifetime) with a small trade-off between coverage and data reporting latency, yet providing the required data reporting capability.",

We call this phenomenon thermal inertia . Thus, if we arrange subsequent meetings in the same room rather than in a room that has not been used for some time, we can take advantage of such undissipated cool or heated air and conserve energy. Though many existing energy conservation solutions for buildings can intelligently turn off facilities when people are absent, we believe that understanding thermal inertia can lead system designs to go beyond on-and-off-based solutions to a wider realm. We propose a framework for exploring thermal inertia in room management. Our framework contains two components. (1) The energy-temperature correlation model captures the relation between indoor temperature change and energy consumption. (2) The energy-aware scheduling algorithms: given information for the relation between energy and temperature change, energy-aware scheduling algorithms arrange meetings not only based on common restrictions, such as meeting time and room capacity requirement, but also energy consumptions. We identify the interface between these components so further works towards same on direction can make efforts on individual components. We develop a system to verify our framework. First, it has a wireless sensor network to collect indoor, outdoor temperature and electricity expenses of the heating or air-conditioning devices. Second, we build an energy-temperature correlation model for the energy expenses and the corresponding room temperature. Third, we develop room scheduling algorithms. In detail, we first extend the current sensor hardware so that it can record the electricity expenses in re-heating or re-cooling a room. As the sensor network needs to work unattendedly, we develop a hardware board for long-range communications so that the Imote2 can send data to a remote server without a computer relay close by. An efficient two-tiered sensor network is developed with our extended Imote2 and TelosB sensors. We apply laws of thermodynamics and build a correlation model of the energy needed to re-cool a room to a target temperature. Such model requires parameter calibration and uses the data collected from the sensor network for model refinement. Armed with the energy-temperature correlation model, we develop an optimal algorithm for a specified case, and we further develop two fast heuristics for different practical scenarios. Our demo system is validated with real deployment of a sensor network for data collection and thermodynamics model calibration. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with synthetic room and meeting configurations, as well as real class schedules and classroom topologies of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, academic calendar year of Spring 2011. We observe 20% energy savings as compared with the current schedules.",

    "abstract": "Efficient medium access control (MAC) is desirable for underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). However, designing an efficient underwater MAC protocol is challenging due to the long propagation delay of the underwater acoustic channel and spatial-temporal uncertainty. In this article, we propose a novel Traffic-Adaptive Receiver-Synchronized underwater MAC protocol, TARS, for throughput maximization. We divide time into equal-sized slots, each the size of one packet transmission time plus a guard time to cope with network dynamics. We adjust the packet transmission phase in a slot, determined by the sender-receiver distance, to align packet receptions for collision reduction. Both the sound propagation speed variation and the node mobility are considered in setting the transmission phase and slot size. We employ a queue-aware utility-optimization framework to determine the optimal transmission strategies dynamically, taking into account both the interference and data queue status. Extensive simulation results show that compared to the existing representative protocols, TARS achieves better performance with higher network throughput and lower packet delay (e.g., about 13%−146% higher in throughput and 13%−21% lower in delay than others in a mobile ad hoc network), as well as robustness under network mobility. Thus, TARS is highly suitable for mobile and traffic-varying UWSNs.",

The varentropy-related term allows us to control the rate of convergence of our update rule, which also reuses some of the most recent observations of each agent to speed up convergence. Under mild technical conditions, we show that the belief of each agent concentrates on the optimal hypothesis set, and we derive a bound for the convergence rate. Furthermore, to overcome the performance degradation due to misinforming agents, who use a corrupted likelihood functions in their belief updates, we propose to use multiple social networks that update their beliefs independently and a convex combination mechanism among the beliefs of all the networks.

Yet, node placement is typically determined in-field via effort-demanding trial-and-error procedures, because existing approaches over-simplify the radio environment; this especially holds for forests, the focus of this article, where trees greatly affect communication. We present LaPS (&lt;underline&gt;L&lt;/underline&gt;iDAR-assisted &lt;underline&gt;P&lt;/underline&gt;lacement for wireless &lt;underline&gt;S&lt;/underline&gt;ensor networks), an approach exploiting remote sensing to identify the best node placement automatically and prior to deployment . Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquired for the target forest are automatically processed to estimate its properties (e.g., tree position and diameter) that, once incorporated into a specialized path loss model, enable per-link estimates of the radio signal attenuation induced by trees. Finally, a genetic algorithm explores placement options by evolving toward a (sub-)optimal solution while satisfying the user’s spatial and network requirements, whose formulation is very flexible and broadly applicable. Our experiments, focused on a real forest, confirm that LaPS yields topologies of significantly higher quality w.r.t. approaches using a regular placement or a standard path loss model. Further, the ability to quickly explore the impact that changes in user requirements have on topology is invaluable to improve the operation of WSNs and reduce the effort of their in-field deployment.",

Based on the observed mobility patterns of smartphone users, sensor data should be preforwarded to the nodes that are visited more frequently with the aim of improving network throughput. In this article, we construct a formal network model and an associated theoretical optimization problem to maximize the throughput subject to energy constraints of sensor nodes. Since a centralized controller is not available in opportunistic data collection, data pre-forwarding (DPF) must operate as a distributed mechanism in which each node decides when and where to forward data based on local information. Hence, we develop a simple distributed DPF mechanism with two heuristic algorithms, implement this proposal in Contiki-OS, and evaluate it thoroughly. We demonstrate empirically, in simulations, that our approach is close to the optimal solution obtained by a centralized algorithm. We also demonstrate that this approach performs well in scenarios based on real mobility traces of smartphone users. Finally, we evaluate our proposal on a small laboratory testbed, demonstrating that the distributed DPF mechanism with heuristic algorithms performs as predicted by simulations, and thus that it is a viable technique for opportunistic data collection through smartphones.",

To tolerate potential sensor faults, a voting mechanism is adopted and a threshold value needs to be specified which is the key to the realization of the distributed solution. Analytical study is conducted to derive the lower and upper bounds for the threshold such that the probability of faulty sensors negatively impacts the localization performance is less than a small value. Second, we focus on the detection and correction of one type of sensor faults, error in camera orientation. We construct a generative image model in each camera based on the detected target location to estimate camera's orientation, detect inaccuracies in camera orientations and correct them before they cascade. Based on results obtained from both simulation and real experiments, we show that the proposed method is effective in localization accuracy as well as fault detection and correction performance.",

A passive wake-up radio is powered by the electromagnetic waves transmitted by a wake-up transmitter rather than a battery on the sensor node. However, this method of powering the wake-up radio results in a short wake-up range, which limits the performance of a passive wake-up radio sensor network. In this article, we describe our design of a passive wake-up radio sensor node—REACH 2 -Mote—using a high-efficiency, energy-harvesting module and a very low power wake-up circuit to achieve an extended wake-up range. We implemented REACH 2 -Mote in hardware and performed field tests to characterize its performance. The experimental results show that REACH 2 -Mote can achieve a wake-up range of 44 feet. We also modeled REACH 2 -Mote and evaluated its performance through simulations, comparing its performance to that of another passive wake-up radio approach, an active wake-up radio approach, and a conventional duty cycling approach.

    "abstract": "Optimizing energy consumption and end-to-end (e2e) packet delay in energy-constrained, delay-sensitive wireless sensor networks is a conflicting multiobjective optimization problem. We investigate the problem from a game theory perspective, where the two optimization objectives are considered as game players. The cost model of each player is mapped through a generalized optimization framework onto protocol-specific MAC parameters. From the optimization framework, a game is first defined by the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) to assure energy consumption and e2e delay balancing. Secondy, the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (KSBS) is used to find an equal proportion of gain between players. Both methods offer a bargaining solution to the duty-cycle MAC protocol under different axioms. As a result, given the two performance requirements (i.e., the maximum latency tolerated by the application and the initial energy budget of nodes), the proposed framework allows to set tunable system parameters to reach a fair equilibrium point that dually minimizes the system latency and energy consumption. For illustration, this formulation is applied to six state-of-the-art wireless sensor network (WSN) MAC protocols: B-MAC, X-MAC, RI-MAC, SMAC, DMAC, and LMAC. The article shows the effectiveness and scalability of such a framework in optimizing protocol parameters that achieve a fair energy-delay performance trade-off under the application requirements.",

Standard performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end latency, overhead and average routing table size are identified for the comparison.

Since sensor networks are typically used for data collection, multihop routing protocols are designed to find routes optimal in upward directions. As sensor networks become widely applied to diverse applications, efficient downward traffic delivery also becomes important. To achieve this, we consider an asymmetric transmission power-based network (APN), where a power-supplied gateway uses high-power radios to cover the entire network via single-hop transmission, whereas common nodes use low-power transmissions. For effective APN operations, we propose a single-hop downlink protocol (SHDP) that consists of direct downlink transmission, local acknowledgment, neighbor forwarding, and contention resolution among the destination’s neighbors. We evaluate SHDP through mathematical analysis, simulations, and testbed experiments. Our proposal outperforms other competitive multihop routing protocols. Specifically, SHDP shows high packet delivery performance and lowers the duty cycle greatly while reducing the packet transmission overhead by &gt;50%.",

Although water systems may be affected by a large variety of contaminants, only a few sensors can be practically deployed. Thus, many types of contaminants are sensed via “proxy sensing,” which may not be 100% reliable. The main problems addressed are (a) adaptation of the network to the available energy to maximize leak/contamination detection and (b) minimal artificial water circulation or leakage to improve detectability during periods of almost zero natural water flow. The article shows, through extensive simulations, that the proposed approach can drastically reduce the leakage/contamination reporting time (from 3.5h up to ∼6min), and the adaptation can reduce this circulation by ∼33% and yet enhance the collected/transmitted data by 30%.",

    "abstract": "Since ancient Greece, handshaking has been commonly practiced between two people as a friendly gesture to express trust and respect, or form a mutual agreement. In this article, we show that such physical contact can be used to bootstrap secure cyber contact between the smart devices worn by users. The key observation is that during handshaking, although belonged to two different users, the two hands involved in the shaking events are often rigidly connected, and therefore exhibit very similar motion patterns. We propose a novel key generation system, which harvests motion data during user handshaking from the wrist-worn smart devices such as smartwatches or fitness bands, and exploits the matching motion patterns to generate symmetric keys on both parties. The generated keys can be then used to establish a secure communication channel for exchanging data between devices. This provides a much more natural and user-friendly alternative for many applications, e.g., exchanging/sharing contact details, friending on social networks, or even making payments, since it doesn’t involve extra bespoke hardware, nor require the users to perform pre-defined gestures. We implement the proposed key generation system on off-the-shelf smartwatches, and extensive evaluation shows that it can reliably generate 128-bit symmetric keys just after around 1s of handshaking (with success rate &gt;99%), and is resilient to different types of attacks including impersonate mimicking attacks, impersonate passive attacks, or eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, for real-time impersonate mimicking attacks, in our experiments, the Equal Error Rate (EER) is only 1.6% on average. We also show that the proposed key generation system can be extremely lightweight and is able to run in-situ on the resource-constrained smartwatches without incurring excessive resource consumption.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a tool for uncovering bugs due to interactive complexity in networked sensing applications. Such bugs are not localized to one component that is faulty, but rather result from complex and unexpected interactions between multiple often individually nonfaulty components. Moreover, the manifestations of these bugs are often not repeatable, making them particularly hard to find, as the particular sequence of events that invokes the bug may not be easy to reconstruct. Because of the distributed nature of failure scenarios, our tool looks for sequences of events that may be responsible for faulty behavior, as opposed to localized bugs such as a bad pointer in a module. We identified several challenges in applying discriminative sequence mining for root cause analysis when the system fails to perform as expected and presented our solutions to those challenges. We also present two alternative schemes, namely, two-stage mining and the progressive discriminative sequence mining to address the scalability challenge. An extensible framework is developed where a front-end collects runtime data logs of the system being debugged and an offline back-end uses frequent discriminative pattern mining to uncover likely causes of failure. We provided several case studies where we applied our tool successfully to troubleshoot the cause of the problem. We uncovered a kernel-level race condition bug in the LiteOS operating system and a protocol design bug in the directed diffusion protocol. We also presented a case study of debugging a multichannel MAC protocol that was found to exhibit corner cases of poor performance (worse than single-channel MAC). The tool helped to uncover event sequences that lead to a highly degraded mode of operation. Fixing the problem significantly improved the performance of the protocol. We also evaluated the extensions presented in this article. Finally, we provided a detailed analysis of tool overhead in terms of memory requirements and impact on the running application.",

    "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks, packet losses are often an indicator of possible undergoing attacks. Therefore, security solutions aiming at providing comprehensive protection must include functions for packet-loss detection. Determining the actual cause of these losses is crucial to a quick and automated reaction to the attack, be it a simple reporting of the attack or a more sophisticated action such as packet rerouting and retransmission. Packet losses in wireless sensor networks can be caused by either attacks affecting the nodes or attacks focused on the wireless links. The efficacy of the response to such attacks is highly dependent on an accurate identification of the actual attack cause. Therefore, approaches to correctly identifying the cause of packet losses are needed. The work presented in this article addresses this problem by designing and implementing a fine-grained analysis (FGA) tool that investigates packet-loss events and reports their most likely cause. Our FGA tool profiles the wireless links between the nodes, as well as their neighborhood, by leveraging resident parameters, such as RSSI and LQI, available within every received packet. The design of the system is fully distributed and event-driven, and its low overhead makes it suitable for resource-constrained entities such as wireless motes. We have validated our approach through real-world experiments, showing that our FGA tool is effective in differentiating between the various attacks that may affect nodes and links.",

Additionally, we design a meta-algorithm that can choose which online algorithm to implement at each point in time, depending on the recent behavior of the system environment. The practical performances of the proposed algorithms are corroborated in trace-driven numerical simulations of data collection of shared bikes.

    "abstract": "Indoor localization has gained increasing attention in the era of the Internet of Things. Among various technologies, WiFi fingerprint-based localization has become a mainstream solution. However, RSS fingerprints suffer from critical drawbacks of spatial ambiguity and temporal instability that root in multipath effects and environmental dynamics, which degrade the performance of these systems and therefore impede their wide deployment in the real world. Pioneering works overcome these limitations at the costs of ubiquity as they mostly resort to additional information or extra user constraints. In this article, we present the design and implementation of ViViPlus, an indoor localization system purely based on WiFi fingerprints, which jointly mitigates spatial ambiguity and temporal instability and derives reliable performance without impairing the ubiquity. The key idea is to embrace the spatial awareness of RSS values in a novel form of RSS Spatial Gradient (RSG) matrix for enhanced WiFi fingerprints. We devise techniques for the representation, construction, and localization of the proposed fingerprint form and integrate them all in a practical system. Extensive experiments across 7 months in different environments demonstrate that ViViPlus significantly improves the accuracy in localization scenarios by about 30% to 50% compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Considering the lack of monitoring method for in-car environment, where there is high risk of spreading infectious diseases, we propose a smartphone-based system, named SymListener, to detect respiratory symptoms in driving environment. By continuously recording acoustic data through a built-in microphone, SymListener can detect the sounds of cough, sneeze, and sniffle. We design a modified ABSE-based method to remove the strong and changeable driving noises while saving energy of the smartphone. An LSTM network is adopted to classify the three types of symptoms according to the carefully designed acoustic features. We implement SymListener on different Android devices and evaluate its performance in real driving environment. The evaluation results show that SymListener can reliably detect target respiratory symptoms with an average accuracy of 92.19% and an average precision of 90.91%.",

    "abstract": "The source localization is a process to determine the location of a signal source based on measurements from sensor nodes or receivers that are spatially distributed in the area around the source. Localizing intruders and mobile users are some of the utilizations of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based source localization problem. However, sensor faults and channel noise are the important issues that degrade the source localization performances of the systems. In this paper, we significantly study and improve our recent results; the representative fault tolerant hitting set and feature selection approaches for localizing a source in a decentralized WSN using the faulty sensor nodes and channel noise. First, we propose a technique to place some active sensor nodes in the sleep state such that the source localization performances of the hitting set and feature selection approaches do not significantly degrade. The proposed technique takes advantage of spatial correlations among sensor nodes, where nearby sensor nodes provide same decisions to the fusion center with a high probability. We observe that the performance gap for the results with and without sleeping sensor nodes decreases by increasing total sensor nodes. In addition, we improve our recent results by proposing a technique based on spatial correlations among sensor nodes to minimize the impact of channels’ noises, especially for a higher fault probability of sensor nodes.

Computer vision-based solutions face challenges like bad lighting conditions and line-of-sight constraints. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of RFID tags in supply chains offers an opportunity to enhance current reconstruction methods. In this paper, we propose TagRecon, a fine-grained multi-object 3D reconstruction scheme utilizing well-deployed RFIDs. Specifically, TagRecon transforms the task of reconstruction into a problem of estimating 3D bounding boxes for tagged packages. By placing dual anchor tags on each target package, TagRecon enables accurate inference of the package’s translation and rotation using RFID-based localization and orientation sensing. Our scheme introduces a novel method to estimate rotations and translations for tagged packages, utilizing the known geometric relationship of anchor tags. Besides, to achieve simultaneous reconstruction of multiple packages, we manage to match tags from various packages through the correlation between anchor tag pairs. As far as we know, this is the first RFID-based solution that can simultaneously realize 3D translation and rotation estimation of multiple objects to a fine granularity. Experiments validate TagRecon achieves a 28.0 cm translation error and 6.8°, 6.0°, and 7.5° rotation errors for roll, pitch, and yaw angles on average.",

As a promising solution, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) tackles this problem by offloading computational tasks from mobile devices to edge servers. However, existing offloading schemes suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, they lack built-in measures to prevent deadline misses. For safety-critical applications, including autonomous driving, a deadline miss could result in catastrophic consequences. Second, existing schemes typically update offloading policies periodically. Namely, a policy based on the current system state is generated for a time window consisting of multiple timeslots. Since system states could change from one timeslot to the next one, the generated policy might not work well during the entire window. In this paper, we propose a novel offloading scheme for safety-critical applications, Constrained Reinforcement Learning based Offloading (CRLO). With CRLO, a safety layer is added to the learning-based policy generator, which effectively eliminates deadline misses. Furthermore, a long-sequence forecasting model, Informer, is utilized to predict temporally-dependent system states, which helps to generate appropriate offloading policies. Our experimental results indicate that CRLO outperforms existing schemes in terms of deadline satisfaction and task completion time.",

The proposed enhanced resampling reconstruction method reduces spatial redundancy by downsampling before transmission and upsampling afterward, aided by a pre-calculated residual map to minimizing quality loss. To reduce angular redundancy while preserving perceptual quality, we designed a LF angular attention estimation network employing specifically designed angular attention kernels to guide differential transmission within the angular domain.

However, the recent IoT camera hacking and local data leakage call for anonymized data at the sensing stage. Also, continuous and pervasive monitoring without blind spots in complicated indoor spaces requires a scalable and economic system. This paper presents Mosaic , a vision-based end-to-end action recognition framework that (i) intrinsically achieves data anonymity from the sensing stage and (ii) battery-free operation for blind spot-free continuous monitoring. Mosaic leverages an extremely low resolution (eLR) Near-Infrared (NIR) image sensor with 6 × 10 pixels for video anonymity and an RFID-compliant fully-passive tag with four solar cells for real-time eLR video streaming under as low as 30 lux (e.g., deep in the shelf without direct light). This is accompanied by a lightweight action recognition neural network for real-time inference (18.4 ms on Intel(R) Core i7-8700). Mosaic achieves an average of 98% accuracy on 10 action classes, hitting the balance between data anonymity and high-precision action recognition.

Existing sensor-based continuous authentication systems ensure the security of mobile devices to some extent, but most have drawbacks, such as lacking end-to-end structure or requiring data from both legitimate users and imposters for training. In this paper, we present RPWAEAuth, a sensor-based continuous Authentication system using Reconstruction Probability in the Wasserstein AutoEncoder. RPWAEAuth implicitly collects user behavior patterns from the built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer of mobile devices. The Wasserstein autoencoder maps the sensor data into a continuous latent space close to a prior distribution and reconstructs them using reconstruction probability for better authentication. In the registration stage, RPWAEAuth collects and preprocesses the sensor data from a legitimate user for RPWAE training. In the authentication stage, when a user interacts with the device, RPWAEAuth collects and preprocesses the sensor data, and then feeds them into the trained RPWAE to generate a reconstruction probability. This probability is then compared with a predefined threshold for user authentication. We evaluate the performance of RPWAEAuth on our dataset in terms of the effectiveness of RPWAEAuth, impact of sensor numbers, effectiveness of reconstruction probability, authentication time, resilience to mimic attacks, comparison with different AEs, and comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that RPWAEAuth achieves superior authentication performance compared to other methods, with an accuracy of 99.34% and an EER of 0.66% on 69 unseen users.",

However, the emergence of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) introduces unique requirements for assessing information freshness, rendering the traditional AoI definition inadequate. This is because the traditional AoI metric operates under the presumption that each data packet bears equal significance. In contrast, AIoT systems must prioritize the transmission of event summaries from smart IoT devices. To promptly capture events as they occur at the sources, we propose a novel information freshness metric called Age of Event (AoE). Subsequently, we thoroughly investigate the problem of AoE-minimizing transmission scheduling. This issue presents a formidable challenge because the event occurrence pattern can be unpredictable, and more crucially, the base station only becomes aware of these occurrences post-transmission. In response, we formulate algorithms and conduct a theoretical analysis applicable to scenarios characterized by complete, zero, or partial knowledge of event occurrences. Evaluations performed on a real traffic event dataset reveal that even in the absence of complete knowledge, our algorithms exhibit competitive performance when compared against the clairvoyant benchmark and markedly outperform AoI baselines.",

To this end, we propose a Privacy-Preserving and Reputation Calibration based Quality-aware Data Collection (PPRC-QDC) scheme. In the PPRC-QDC scheme, a two-tier truth discovery is proposed to acquire high-quality data. More importantly, a privacy-preserving method is proposed to recognize the users’ reputations by comparing the weights with the trusted users rather than the data to effectively identify the honest users. Finally, theoretical analysis confirms our PPRC-QDC has stronger privacy preservation and robustness capability. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that under privacy preservation, our PPRC-QDC scheme recognizes users’ reputations with an accuracy of 91.5%, and improves the quality of data collection by 11.0%-12.1%.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of underwater wireless communication, vast oceanic expanses often demand large-scale deployment of Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs). UWSNs rely on acoustic communication channels, presenting distinct challenges like prolonged propagation delays, restricted bandwidth, and dynamic topologies. Furthermore, the far-reaching and multi-path nature of acoustic signals results in significant hidden terminal problems and ubiquitous interference between neighboring nodes. Therefore, an efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial for optimizing UWSN performance. This paper proposes IC-MAC, a MAC protocol tailored for UWSNs to avoid collisions and improve network performance. IC-MAC employs distributed clustering to group sensor nodes and the cluster head degree is defined for each node, which is a coefficient that accentuates nodes characterized by a higher incidence of collision associations. To identify interfering nodes and construct an interference-free graph, an interference identification algorithm is proposed. In addition, a heuristic graph coloring technique, guided by particle swarm optimization (PSO), allocates time slots efficiently to achieve collision-free transmission scheduling and enhanced spatial reuse. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the IC-MAC protocol in enhancing throughput, reducing delay, and improving packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency. This is achieved through efficient spatial resource utilization and robust management of collisions and interference, specifically tailored for underwater acoustic channels, outperforming existing MAC protocols.",

However, ensuring secure and efficient transmission of data from IoT devices has become a key technological focus in current research on the development of industrial IoT. Attribute encryption technology is an effective encryption technique that ensures data security; meanwhile, proxy re-encryption technology allows proxies to encrypt original ciphertext into new ciphertext without accessing any plaintext information. The combination of these two technologies enables secure transmission of data among users with different attributes. However, the high computational overhead remains a significant factor limiting the development of this solution. IoT data needs to be shared not only among different units within the same domain but also across units in different domains. Securing shared data has emerged as a pivotal area of focus in contemporary research. In this paper, we propose an improved fine-grained proxy re-encryption scheme for cross-attribute domains, which not only facilitates simple cross-domain data sharing but also enhances encryption efficiency.

    "abstract": "Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on IoT devices for model serving is a promising solution for intelligent applications with high real-time requirements and bandwidth sensitivity. To cope with the prohibitive computation and storage overheads of modern DNNs, great efforts have been devoted to the model compression technique. Most existing model compression approaches focus on minimizing the model size and maximizing the average accuracy on all the inference tasks. However, real-world IoT tasks have various service-level objectives (SLOs). Models compressed by existing methods struggle to simultaneously meet SLOs in multiple dimensions, such as latency and accuracy. In this work, we study model compression with a joint consideration of SLOs awareness and task adaptation. Through our extensive experience with model compression across various IoT tasks, we observe that the importance of individual channels in contributing to accuracy is heavily influenced by task-specific data distribution. Therefore, we design a channel Shapley algorithm to estimate the importance of individual channels in DNNs and propose a deep reinforcement learning-based controller to incorporate SLOs into the compression objective. Integrating these designs, we propose and prototype ChannelZip, the first SLO-aware channel compression framework. Extensive evaluations on real IoT model serving systems show the effectiveness in task adaptation of ChannelZip. ChannelZip outperforms strong model compression baselines by 3.77% accuracy and achieves a 69% average parameter compression ratio. Real-world deployment on different IoT devices shows that ChannelZip meets all task SLOs and achieves up to 2.32 × inference speedup.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized federated learning emerged to eliminate the reliance on the central server and address the single point of failure and the network bottleneck in centralized federated learning. However, existing works on decentralized federated learning suffer from the following three challenges. First, the transmission of model parameters between devices results in significant bandwidth consumption and network congestion. Second, the decentralized architecture involves numerous devices, which increases the risk of poisoned behavior. Third, the data heterogeneity of devices seriously affects the model accuracy. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research that can effectively address all the challenges above. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme of D ecentralized federated learning towards C ommunication E fficiency, R obustness, and P ersonalization (i.e., D-CERP). We aim to customize personalized models for each client with lower communication and computation overhead, which can also defend against Byzantine attacks in the decentralized scenario. Specifically, we employ local sparse training with a personalized mask to better fit the heterogeneous data for each client and reduce both on-device computation overhead and cross-device communication overhead. Besides, we apply a trusted neighbor selection scheme based on multi-armed bandit by assigning rewards to high-quality submissions of each communication round, thereby improving the Byzantine robustness. In our experiments, we utilize two data partitioning methods to simulate the heterogeneity of clients in the decentralized setting and conduct exhaustive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to several state-of-the-art baselines, D-CERP achieves comparable personalization with a lower overhead in non-adversarial settings and provides additionally superior Byzantine robustness in adversarial settings.",

However, the precision of rainfall data is compromised by the limited spatial resolution of the rain gauges and the significant variability of hyperlocal rainfall, resulting in substantial water waste. To improve irrigation efficiency, we developed a cost-effective irrigation system, dubbed ERIC, which employs machine learning models to estimate rainfall from commodity doorbell camera footage and optimizes irrigation schedules without human intervention. Specifically, we: a) designed novel visual and audio features with lightweight neural network models to robustly infer rainfall from the camera at the edge, preserving user privacy; b) built a complete end-to-end irrigation system on Raspberry Pi 4, costing only $75. We deployed the system to five locations (collecting more than 750 hours of video) with diverse environmental backgrounds and varying camera placements. Our realistic evaluation validates that ERIC achieves state-of-the-art rainfall estimation performance (∼ 5mm/day), saving 9,112 gallons/month of water, translating to $28.56/month in utility savings.

To prevent these traffic analytics (TA)-based inference attacks, smart home owners are considering deploying virtual private networks (VPNs) to safeguard their smart speakers. In this work, we design a new machine learning-powered attack framework—VoiceAttack that could still accurately fingerprint voice commands on VPN-encrypted voice speaker network traffic. We evaluate VoiceAttack under 5 different real-world settings using Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Our results show that VoiceAttack could correctly infer voice command sentences with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.68 in a closed-world setting and infer voice command categories with an MCC of 0.84 in an open-world setting by eavesdropping VPN-encrypted network traffic data. This presents a significant risk to user privacy and security, as it suggests that external on-path attackers could still potentially intercept and decipher users’ voice commands despite the VPN encryption. We then further examine the sensitivity of voice speaker commands to VoiceAttack. We find that 134 voice speaker commands are highly vulnerable to VoiceAttack. We also present a defense approach—VoiceDefense, which could inject inject appropriate traffic “noise” into voice speaker traffic. And our evaluation results show that VoiceDefense could effectively mitigate VoiceAttack on Amazon Echo and Google Home.",

This study presents a novel methodology for improving the efficacy of signature aggregation in a scenario involving doctors and patients while mitigating concerns about location privacy. Though there have been prior proposals for signature aggregation schemes, the proposed approach seeks to optimize the aggregation process within the considered scenario, thereby improving performance and reducing computational and communication burden. In addition, the proposed scheme integrates a resilient mechanism that safeguards the doctor’s location privacy by utilizing the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Advanced cryptographic algorithms and location-anonymization techniques are employed in the proposed method to safeguard the confidentiality of the doctors’ location. The security of the proposed scheme is formally analyzed using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and formally verified using the automated software validation tool, known as the Scyther tool, and an informal analysis of various security attributes confirms the security robustness of the proposed scheme. The efficacy is evaluated in comparison to analogous works utilizing the Cygwin software. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has lower communication costs as compared to existing competing schemes. Moreover, the serving ratio in the proposed scheme is high even if the number of patients is low for doctors.",

    "abstract": "Online Building Load Forecasting (BLF) is a scheme that designs a model update strategy to continuously update the deployed machine learning (ML)-based BLF model, ensuring its adaptation to changes in data distribution. Numerous online BLF schemes have been proposed recently. However, updates may prove ineffective, leading to a degradation in accuracy or even performance inferior to that of models without updates. A primary cause of this issue is the inadequate preparation of the data used for model updates (referred to as the updating set ). Most existing online BLF schemes rely on historical data for model updates, which may fail to capture the characteristics of future data distributions. Preparing a suitable updating set is a challenging and often ad hoc task. In this paper, we propose the use of automated data augmentation (AutoDA) , a reinforcement learning-based data augmentation (DA) framework, to automatically search for optimal DA policies for generating synthetic data. We introduce AugPlug and demonstrate its capability to generate effective updating sets. A distinctive advantage of its plug-and-play compatibility enables seamless integration into various BLF schemes. Extensive experiments conducted on four published online BLF schemes, involving hundreds of buildings, demonstrate that AugPlug improves the performance of online BLF by 29.37%.",

Wireless-based methods, favored for their non-invasive nature and ease of deployment, are becoming more common. However, existing works, which typically depend on the user’s position, often perform poorly in varied writing positions. Additionally, they do not incorporate user identity information, which could lead to security vulnerabilities by failing to reject unauthorized users. To address these issues, this paper introduces RF-Eye , a system that enables contactless, position-independent handwriting recognition and user identification without prior training. Its innovative approach uses each Radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag as a unique viewpoint for observing hand movements and employs pairs of tags to track directional changes. Specifically, building upon the signal transmission model and the Fresnel Zone, we propose a novel feature, DCG , to capture changes in gesture direction and confirm its consistency across different positions. Based on DCG , we develop unique patterns for common handwriting symbols that enhance our recognition algorithm. Moreover, to strengthen the system security, we link these patterns with distinct handwriting styles through the extraction of finer-grained features, thus preventing the misuse of the system by unauthorized users. Extensive experiments demonstrate RF-Eye ’s efficacy, which achieves recognition accuracies of 93.5%, 95.2%, and 95.8% for 26 lowercase letters, 10 digits, and 10 graphic symbols, respectively, and identifying unauthorized users with 98.6% accuracy.",

Currently, such failures are typically detected using either : (a) heavily engineered data-driven, statistical approaches that can have high false positive rates due to unseen data patterns or (b) expensive, unscalable methods that use additional hardware such as video cameras or a golden reference sensor.

    "abstract": "In response to the escalating prevalence of inference attacks on network traffic, traffic shaping emerges as a highly effective strategy to curb the leakage of user privacy information. Although many traffic shaping mechanisms have been proposed, their privacy-preserving performance has mostly been evaluated empirically or by focusing solely on inter-event traffic shaping methods, thereby neglecting intra-event information. In this work, we develop a general framework considering intra-event characteristics for quantifying privacy leakage. The proposed evaluation framework provides quantitative assessments of privacy risks and can guide the design and improvement of traffic-shaping mechanisms. Our theoretical results identify the limitation of existing approaches, namely, the absence of a flexible trade-off between privacy-preserving effectiveness and cost. This trade-off is critical for IoT applications, as devices are highly heterogeneous in terms of resources (i.e., bandwidth) and need to meet service-level objectives (e.g., latency). To achieve this design goal, we model the trade-off problem as multi-armed bandits and propose an online traffic-shaping algorithm named DPShaping. DPShaping has a proven privacy-preserving guarantee and supports flexible trade-offs between effectiveness and communication cost. We compare our approach with three representative algorithms. Experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art schemes, DPShaping achieves lower attack accuracy (only 16.8%) and reduces bandwidth and delay.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a general solution for point set matching that effectively addresses the challenges of low-overlap, sparse, or featureless point set matching (LSFPM). Unlike previous methods that mainly rely on feature or neighborhood similarity that often fail under such difficult conditions, this work proposes a Geometry-based Point Matching (GPM) method. GPM first introduces two geometric concepts: the “Structural Element” (SE) and the “Superstructural Element” (SSE), both of which are constructed based on local geometric structures. The SSE is an enhanced version of the SE. A descriptor for the SE, called the SE Descriptor (SED), is designed to encode the SE and facilitate an efficient geometry-based similarity metric. We demonstrate that the cosine similarity of SEDs is invariant to scale and rotation. Subsequently, a SE Matching Maximization (SEMM) problem is formulated to identify a size-penalized SSE set that maximizes the sum of similarities. This problem is efficiently solved using the proposed SEMM-MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) algorithm. The matched SSEs then vote on corresponding point matches, generating high-confidence one-to-one matches, low-confidence one-to-one matches and one-to-many matches. Finally, the InferMatch algorithm is proposed to jointly assess low-confidence one-to-one point set matching while simultaneously distinguishing one-to-many point set matching. The GPM approach can also complement other feature-based and motion-based methods. It has been extensively validated on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its versatility in addressing various point set matching problems, and is not limited to the LSFPM problem. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including SPair-71k, UAVDT, VisDrone2021-MOT, and SparseMatch, further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of GPM. The proposed approach significantly improves matching performance under challenging conditions and effectively addresses key limitations of existing point set matching methods.",

    "abstract": "Vital sign detection, based on Channel State Information (CSI) from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices, has become a popular research area. Previous works in this field mainly focus on respiration, while heartbeat sensing has not been well studied yet, because its signal is very weak and overwhelmed by hardware noises and the respiration signal. Different from existing research that exploits directional antenna, the proposed WiCG ( Wi Fi C ardio G ram) system uses common antennas, and not only accurately senses heartbeat rate but also provides the heartbeat signal for further analysis in complex real-life home scenes. Specifically, we first propose an effective denoising solution for Wi-Fi CSI by exploiting its spatial structure, which exhibits strong correlation among the In-phase/Quadrature components. Leveraging this characteristic with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) achieves effective reduction of ambient noise in both the amplitude and phase of the CSI. Then, we introduce a heartbeat enhancement scheme that utilizes the periodicity of the heartbeat signal. By applying Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), the complex effects of residual noise and respiratory interference are effectively mitigated. Extensive experiments have proven that WiCG can effectively sense the heartbeat rate. In a real deployment environment, the average detection error can be reduced to 0.28 bpm, close to current commercial heartbeat sensors.",

    "abstract": "The localization of sensor networks involves determining the spatial coordinates of each sensor in a deployed network. This task is accomplished by utilizing noisy distance measurements between neighboring sensors and a limited number of anchor sensors, which are sensors with known approximate locations. In this study, we present a unified maximum-likelihood formulation to address the sensor network localization problem. Our formulation incorporates anchor uncertainty by employing a truncated normal multivariate distribution. This unified approach generalizes previous formulations as it is applicable to various network architectures and noise levels, and various anchor certainty or uncertainty scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel algorithm that is simple, fast, fully distributed, and parallel. This algorithm converges to critical points of the non-convex, non-smooth, and constrained unified maximum-likelihood formulation. Notably, the algorithm is suitable for both centralized and distributed network architectures, making it well-suited for very large-scale networks comprising even thousands of sensors.",

    "abstract": "RFID-based gesture recognition has gained considerable attention in recent years due to the cost-effectiveness of RFID tags and their advantages in preserving visual privacy, providing convenience to users. Existing RFID-based gesture recognition systems typically require users to collect a large amount of training data for each gesture class, and once a new class is introduced, the entire recognition model needs to be retrained. This greatly limits their scalability for new gestures. In this article, we propose FewSense, a practical RFID sensing system that achieves accurate gesture recognition with a small number of training samples. To provide sufficient training samples for FewSense, we introduce a virtual sample generation method to achieve data augmentation. Based on the augmented training data, FewSense enables few-shot gesture recognition. With the introduction of a fine-tuning mechanism, FewSense can easily adapt to changing gesture classes. Real-world experiments demonstrate that even with only seven training samples, FewSense achieves 90% recognition accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clusters are widely used in spectrum reconnaissance, where spectrum samples are transmitted back to the sink through flying ad hoc network (FANET). High sampling frequencies are required, but result in a large amount of data not being transmitted over the wireless network, affecting throughput and reliability of the network. The problem boils down to what a good sampling frequency is and how to find it. There is an unknown dynamic sampling frequency threshold, beyond which high packet loss occurs. Prior work focused on achieving higher frequencies through FANET optimization but neglected methods to find this threshold and achieve a maximum value. We propose an adaptive protocol based on binary search. With limited bandwidth and consistent sampling frequency, the protocol dynamically adjusts sampling frequencies in a phased manner at the application layer to maximize the sampling frequency that the network can handle. In addition to spectrum reconnaissance, this protocol can be extended to other applications with consistent sampling frequencies. We have constructed an application based on the EXata simulation platform to analyze the performance of the protocol in delay, stability, reliability, and search times.

However, their low-power nature makes them vulnerable to cross-technology interference (CTI) from other wireless technologies sharing the same unlicensed frequency bands. Existing solutions address this issue through signal analysis and coding techniques. Despite these efforts, the research on CTI mitigation needs to go one step further - to design a systematic framework for enhanced interference resilience. This paper proposes SLoRa+, a systematic framework that integrates symbol recovery with soft decoding to achieve synergic interference resilience for LoRa. SLoRa+’s symbol recovery employs a two-stage analysis to recover corrupted LoRa symbols at a low cost. It also estimates the confidence of the recovered symbols by considering the characteristics of both LoRa and CTI. This confidence information is then utilized in soft decoding to improve error correction capabilities. Supported by theoretical analysis and real testbed evaluations, including commercial LoRa nodes and USRP B210, our experiments under different settings, i.e., various CTI sources and frequency bands, demonstrate SLoRa+’s effectiveness. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, SLoRa+ enhances CTI protection capability by 1.6 × with only 1% of the computation cost.",

However, challenges such as low spectrum utilization due to massive sensor deployment, signal degradation from high-speed mobility, and computational resource allocation issues hinder the real-time and secure operation of intelligent vehicles. Therefore, we propose a resource allocation optimization method for VEC based on Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) and Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) technologies. Specifically, OTFS is leveraged to multiplex roadside unit (RSU) radar resources, improving spectrum efficiency. We develop comprehensive models for communication, vehicle mobility, sensing, delay, energy consumption, and formulate a delay-minimization resource allocation problem. The problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process and solved with an improved Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, which incorporates prioritized experience sampling and dynamic parameter update to accelerate training and enhance agent-environment interaction. Extensive simulations are conducted in a VEC environment, where the proposed algorithm is compared with DDQN, MADDPG, and MRL-DDPG.

    "abstract": "Early detection of myocardial infarction (MI) is essential for alleviating symptoms and improving daily activity performance. Researchers typically employ continuous segments of heartbeat signals (20-30 seconds), such as ECG signals, for MI detection, as MI often induces changes in heartbeat patterns. Current MI detection methods, like wearable sensors, may induce discomfort from prolonged wear, and Radio Frequency (RF) based approaches might fail to extract fine-grained heartbeat signals during vigorous movement. This paper presents a reliable and motion-robust MI detection method based on RF signals. By developing a series of advanced signal processing algorithms, MI-Ra can capture fine-grained heartbeat signals during various daily activities. Our design is inspired by the fact that RF reflections caused by heartbeat signals are mixed with other motion-induced reflections in a nonlinear manner. We utilize the Taylor series expansion method to extract the linear component of these mixed non-linear signals and propose a novel Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) method, named IQ-TransGAN, to separate the heartbeat signal. To enhance MI detection reliability, MI-Ra employs a multi-periodicity modeling method to extract refined signal representations from recovered heartbeat signals. We have recruited 50 volunteers with MI from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan, China, and 50 volunteers without MI, for comprehensive evaluations. The results demonstrate that MI-Ra achieves an average MI detection accuracy of 95.2% when user is quasi-stationary. Even during user non-stationary conditions, MI-Ra maintains an average detection accuracy of 90.5%. MI-Ra shows promise in paving way for smart home healthcare.",

However, these vehicles often encounter small and occluded objects, leading to fewer available features and requirement of high positioning accuracy.

Initially, we employ pre-trained 3D and 2D object detection models to generate 3D and 2D bounding boxes. Subsequently, a fusion strategy grounded in the rotation intersection ratio, merges two kinds of bounding boxes. To capture information from small objects, we develop a grouping-splitting residual network enhanced with coordinate attention, facilitating the extraction of more detailed information. Experimental results on KITTI dataset reveal that our method achieves a 90.46% accuracy for hard samples in Bird’s eye view. Compared with the advanced multi-modal 3D object detection performance, such as CLOCs, HMFI and PointPainting, our accuracy in hard samples has improved by 1.1%, 1.84% and 3.75%.",

    "abstract": "Careful parametrization of networking protocols is crucial to maximize the performance of low-power wireless systems and ensure that stringent application requirements can be met. This is a non-trivial task involving thorough characterization on testbeds and requiring expert knowledge. Unfortunately, the community still lacks a tool to facilitate parameter exploration while minimizing the necessary experimentation time on testbeds. Such a tool would be invaluable, as exhaustive parameter searches can be time-prohibitive or unfeasible given limited testbed availability, whereas non-exhaustive unguided searches rarely deliver satisfactory results. In this paper, we present APEX, a framework enabling an automated and informed parameter exploration for low-power wireless protocols and allowing convergence to the best parameter set within a limited number of testbed trials. We design APEX using Gaussian processes to effectively handle noisy experimental data and estimate the optimality of a parameter combination. After developing a prototype of APEX, we demonstrate its effectiveness by parametrizing two IEEE 802.15.4 protocols across a wide range of application requirements. Our results show that APEX can return the best parameter set with up to 10.6x, 4.5x, 4.3x and 3.25x less testbed trials than traditional solutions based on exhaustive search, greedy approaches, support vector regression and reinforcement learning, respectively.",

Most existing solutions rely on regularly sampled GPS points, which capture data only from participating vehicles. In this work, we exploit traffic camera observation data for city-wide vehicle trajectory recovery. Nevertheless, there are two major challenges. First, traffic cameras are sparsely deployed at road intersections, resulting in uneven vehicle observations and irregular sampling intervals. Second, substantial uncertainty arises when reconstructing trajectories between distant consecutive observations. To address the above challenges, we propose TR-ODE , a novel encoder-decoder framework based on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for continuous-time trajectory recovery. Specifically, TR-ODE employs customized GRU-ODE-Bayes to evolve hidden states between observations and update the current hidden state to incorporate the incoming observations. By incorporating a multi-task learning block, TrajRec , our method integrates road embeddings and self-attention scores to assist in simultaneous predictions on road segments and moving ratios for trajectory recovery. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world datasets demonstrate that TR-ODE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in vehicle trajectory recovery from irregular observations, reducing MAE and RMSE by up to 17.11% and 14.47%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of the deployment settings of sensor networks is naturally inherited from the diversity of geographical features of the embedded environment, and greatly influences network design. Many sensor network protocols in the literature implicitly assume that sensor nodes are deployed inside a simple geometric region, without considering possible obstacles and holes in the deployment environment. When the real deployment setting deviates from that, we often observe degraded performance. Thus, it is highly desirable to have a generic approach to handle sensor fields with complex shapes. In this article, we propose a segmentation algorithm that partitions an irregular sensor field into nicely shaped pieces such that algorithms and protocols that assume a nice sensor field can be applied inside each piece. Across the segments, problem dependent structures specify how the segments and data collected in these segments are integrated. Our segmentation algorithm does not require any extra knowledge (e.g., sensor locations) and only uses network connectivity information. This unified spatial-partitioning approach makes the protocol design become flexible and independent of deployment specifics. Existing protocols are still reusable with segmentation, and the development of new topology-adaptive protocols becomes much easier. We verified the correctness of the algorithm on various topologies and evaluated the performance improvements by integrating shape segmentation with several fundamental problems in network design.",

Such applications involve resource-limited embedded sensor nodes that have small size and low power requirements. Based on the need for extended network lifetimes in WSNs in terms of energy use, the energy efficiency of computation and communication operations in the sensor nodes becomes critical. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications typically require intensive data processing operations and as a result are difficult to implement directly in resource-limited WSNs. In this article, we present a novel design methodology for modeling and implementing computationally intensive DSP applications applied to wireless sensor networks. This methodology explores efficient modeling techniques for DSP applications, including data sensing and processing; derives formulations of Energy-Driven Partitioning (EDP) for distributing such applications across wireless sensor networks; and develops efficient heuristic algorithms for finding partitioning results that maximize the network lifetime. To address such an energy-driven partitioning problem, this article provides a new way of aggregating data and reducing communication traffic among nodes based on application analysis. By considering low data token delivery points and the distribution of computation in the application, our approach finds energy-efficient trade-offs between data communication and computation.",

    "abstract": "Let consider a set of anonymous moving objects to be tracked in a binary sensor network. This article studies the problem of associating deterministically a track revealed by the sensor network with the trajectory of an unique anonymous object, namely the multiple object tracking and identification (MOTI) problem. In our model, the network is represented by a sparse connected graph where each vertex represents a binary sensor and there is an edge between two sensors if an object can pass from one sensed region to another one without activating any other sensor. The difficulty of MOTI lies in the fact that the trajectories of two or more objects can be so close that the corresponding tracks on the sensor network can no longer be distinguished (track merging), thus confusing the deterministic association between an object trajectory and a track. The article presents several results. We first show that MOTI cannot be solved on a general graph of ideal binary sensors even by an omniscient external observer if all the objects can freely move on the graph. Then we describe restrictions that can be imposed a priori either on the graph, on the object movements, or on both, to make the MOTI problem always solvable. In the absence of an omniscient observer, we show how our results can lead to the definition of distributed algorithms that are able to detect when the system is in a state where MOTI becomes unsolvable.",

    "abstract": "Broadcast is an efficient communication channel on wireless sensor networks. Through authentic broadcast, deployed sensors can perform legitimate actions issued by a base station. According to previous literature, a complete solution for authentic broadcast is digital signature based on asymmetric cryptography. However, asymmetric cryptography utilizes expensive operations, which result in computational bottlenecks. Among these cryptosystems, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) seems to be the most efficient and the most popular choice. Unfortunately, signature verification in ECC is not efficient enough. In this article, we propose an authentic broadcast scheme based on RSA. Unlike conventional approaches, the proposed scheme adopts short moduli to enhance performance. Meanwhile, the weakness of short moduli can be fixed with rekeying strategies. To minimize the rekeying overhead, a Multi-Modulus RSA generation algorithm, which can reduce communication overhead by 50%, is proposed. We implemented the proposed scheme on MICAz. On 512-bit moduli, each verification spends at most 0.077 seconds, which is highly competitive with other public-key cryptosystems.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) appeal to a wide range of applications that involve the monitoring of various physical phenomena. However, WSNs are subject to many threats. In particular, lack of pervasive tamper-resistant hardware results in sensors being easy targets for compromise. Having compromised a sensor, the adversary learns all the sensor secrets, allowing it to later encrypt/decrypt or authenticate messages on behalf of that sensor. This threat is particularly relevant in the novel unattended wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) scenario. UWSNs operate without constant supervision by a trusted sink. UWSN's unattended nature and increased exposure to attacks prompts the need for special techniques geared towards regaining security after being compromised. In this article, we investigate cooperative self-healing in UWSNs and propose various techniques to allow unattended sensors to recover security after compromise. Our techniques provide seamless healing rates even against a very agile and powerful adversary. The effectiveness and viability of our proposed techniques are assessed by thorough analysis and supported by simulation results. Finally, we introduce some real-world issues affecting UWSN deployment and provide some solutions for them as well as a few open problems calling for further investigation.",

The majority of these results have not been extended for small or moderate values of n ; whereas in many practical networks, n is not very large. In this article, we consider finite (small-scale) wireless sensor networks. We first show that previous asymptotic results provide poor approximations for such networks. We provide a set of differences between small-scale and large-scale analysis and propose a methodology for analysis of finite sensor networks. Furthermore, we consider two models for such networks: unreliable sensor grids and sensor networks with random node deployment. We provide easily computable expressions for bounds on the coverage and connectivity of these networks. With validation from simulations, we show that the derived analytic expressions give very good estimates of such quantities for finite sensor networks. Our investigation confirms the fact that small-scale networks possess unique characteristics different from their large-scale counterparts, necessitating the development of a new framework for their analysis and design.",

    "abstract": "Securing a sensor network poses a variety of problems. Of those, an important one is of providing privacy to the event-detecting sensor node and integrity to the data gathered by the node. Compromised source privacy can inadvertently leak event location. Safeguarding the privacy of the source node is important, as sensor networks hold critical roles in military application, tracking endangered species, etc. Existing techniques in sensor networks use either random walk path or generate fake event packets to make it hard for an adversary to trace back to the source, since encryption alone may not help prevent a traffic analysis attack. In this work, without using traditional overhead-intensive methods, we present a scheme for hiding source information using cryptographic techniques incurring lower overhead. The packet is modified en route by dynamically selected nodes to make it difficult for a malicious entity to trace back the packet to a source node and also to prevent packet spoofing. This is important because the adversary model considers a super-local eavesdropper having the ability to compromise sensor nodes. Additionally, we provide a method for the base station to recover corrupted packets and identify the location of the compromised node. We analyze the ability of our proposed scheme to withstand different attacks and demonstrate its efficiency in terms of overhead and functionality when compared to existing work.",

Our work is motivated by the observation that capture effect can improve the reliability of synchronous transmission. We experimentally study the effect of physical layer capture and identify guidelines in which it can be exploited to enhance reliability. Based on these observations, we propose Syncast, a data dissemination protocol that improves over Glossy by exploiting capture effect over multichannels. The evaluation shows that Syncast provides a robust, reliable, and scalable data dissemination of large packets with lower end-to-end delay and up to 92% reduced radio-on-time.",

Anomaly detection can identify severe threats to WSN applications, provided that there is a sufficient amount of genuine information. This article presents a novel method to calculate an assurance measure for the network by estimating the maximum number of malicious measurements that can be tolerated. In previous work, the resilience of anomaly detection to malicious measurements has been tested only against arbitrary attacks, which are not necessarily sophisticated. The novel method presented here is based on an optimization algorithm, which maximizes the attack’s chance of staying undetected while causing damage to the application, thus seeking the worst-case scenario for the anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm is tested on a wildfire monitoring WSN to estimate the benefits of anomaly detection on the system’s resilience. The algorithm also returns the measurements that the attacker needs to synthesize, which are studied to highlight the weak spots of anomaly detection. Finally, this article presents a novel methodology that takes in input the degree of resilience required and automatically designs the deployment that satisfies such a requirement.",

Clock synchronization protocols based on network message exchanges, though widely used in current network systems, are susceptible to delay attacks against the packet transmission. This vulnerability cannot be solved by conventional security measures, such as encryption, and remains an open problem. This article proposes to use the sine voltage waveform of a utility power grid to synchronize network nodes connected to the same grid. Our experiments demonstrate that minute fluctuations of the voltage’s cycle length encode fine-grained global time information in Singapore’s utility grid. Based on this key result, we develop a clock synchronization approach that achieves good accuracy and is provably secure against packet-delay attacks. Implementation results show that our approach achieves an average synchronization error of 0.1 ms between two network nodes that are deployed in office and residential buildings 10 km apart. When the proposed system is deployed within the same floor of an office building, the error reduces to 10 μs. When there are heavy industrial loads close to one of the two nodes 10 km apart, the system can still maintain subsecond accuracy. Moreover, when the two nodes are deployed within the same building floor with industrial loads nearby, the average synchronization error is 34 μ",

However, since the EMR signal is often weak and noisy, extracting the ENF is challenging, especially on resource-limited sensor platforms. We design an efficient EMR conditioning algorithm and evaluate the time accuracy of EMR natural timestamps on two representative classes of IoT platforms—a high-end single-board computer with a customized EMR antenna and a low-end mote with a normal conductor wire acting as EMR antenna. Extensive measurements at six sites in a city, which are away from each other for up to 24km, show that the high-end and low-end nodes achieve median time errors of about 50ms and 150ms, respectively.

In this article, we construct monetary-based incentive mechanisms to motivate users to preprocess the collected raw data for the crowdsourcer. For two common crowdsensing scenarios, we propose two system models, which are the single-task-multiple-participants (STMP) model and the multiple-tasks-multiple-participants (MTMP) model. In the STMP model, we design an incentive mechanism based on game theory and prove that there is a Nash equilibrium.

Furthermore, the utility maximization problems of the crowdsourcer and users are simultaneously considered in our incentive mechanisms.

A majority of network design is network centric and focuses primarily on network performance, for example, efficient sensing and reliable data delivery. Although several tools have been developed to assist debugging and fault diagnosis, it is yet to systematically examine the underlying heavy burden that users face throughout the lifetime of WSNs. In this article, we propose a general Multimode user-CentriC (MC 2 ) framework that can, with simple user inputs, adjust itself to assist user operation and thus reduce the users' burden at various stages. In particular, we have identified utilities that are essential at each stage and grouped them into modes . In each mode, only the corresponding utilities will be loaded, and modes can be easily switched using the customized MC 2 sensor platform. As such, we reduce the runtime interference between various utilities and simplify their development as well as their debugging. We validated our MC 2 software and the sensor platform in a long-lived microclimate monitoring system deployed at a wildland heritage site, Mogao Grottoes. In our current system, 241 sensor nodes have been deployed in 57 caves, and the network has been running for over five years. Our experimental validation shows that the MC 2 framework shortens the time for network deployment and maintenance, and makes network maintenance doable by field experts (in our case, historians).",

To substantiate, we consider the application of data gathering from a set of machines that communicate directly to an aggregator. Since the aggregator has limited radio resources, the problem arises as to how the resource can be effectively utilized for supporting such an application. We investigate “data-centric” resource allocation that aims to maximize information entropy of data collected through selecting the subset of machines to transmit, determining the amount of resources to allocate, and scheduling the sequence of transmissions. We present two instantiations of the problems when machines can perform distributed source coding or dependent source coding based on the data overheard from neighboring machines and then propose algorithms for solving the joint optimization problems. Evaluation results show that compared to conventional “machine-centric” resource allocation that aims to maximize the aggregate data rates or number of supported machines, “data-centric” resource allocation exhibits significant performance gain in terms of the quality of data that can be collected for the given amount of radio resources.",

We achieve this by using commonly available mobile devices such as smartphones. At least one mobile device takes images that overlap with a fixed camera's view and records the GPS position and 3D orientation of the device when an image is captured. These sensor measurements (including the image, GPS position, and device orientation) are fused in order to calibrate the fixed camera. This article derives a novel maximum likelihood estimation formulation for finding the most probable location and orientation of a fixed camera.

The proposed DSC scheme has a salient feature: with a minimum buffer size 2 in each sensor node, by querying any m −1 sensor nodes, the mBS can reconstruct the m latest data segments with high probability, where m is the number of latest data segments in a time interval t in which n ( t ) ( m ≤ n ( t )) data segments are generated. The necessary storage space in each sensor node can be adjusted by changing the number of sensor nodes queried by the mBS. Furthermore, the transmission cost for data submission to the mBS can be reduced with some additional storage space in each sensor node. The comprehensive performance evaluation has been conducted through computer simulation. It is shown that the proposed DSC scheme outperforms the existing scheme significantly.",

In this context, we provide a novel utility function, which gives reduced benefit to players with higher transmission power, and a subsequent reduction in radio interference to other coexisting BANs. Considering the purpose of inter-BAN interference mitigation, PDR is expressed as a compressed exponential function of inverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio, so it is essentially a function of transmit powers of all coexisting BANs. It is shown that a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE) exists, and hence there is a subgame-perfect equilibrium, considering best response at each stage independent of history. In addition, the NE is conjectured to be the socially optimal solution according to all possible action profiles. Realistic and extensive on- and inter-body channel models are employed.

SURF first utilizes the hop-count distance function to construct the iso-contour in discrete settings, and then it uses the concept of the Reeb graph and the maximum cut set to divide the network into different regions. Finally, it conducts a novel serial traversal scheme, enabling the traversal within and between regions. To the best of our knowledge, SURF is the first high genus 3D surface WSN targeted and pure connectivity-based solution for linearizing the networks. It is fully distributed and highly scalable, requiring a nearly constant storage and communication cost per node in the network. To incorporate adaptive density of the constructed space filling curve, we also design a second algorithm, called SURF + , which makes use of parameterized spiral-like curves to cover the 3D surface and thus can yield a multiresolution SFC adapting to different requirements on travel budget or fusion delay. The application combining both algorithms for in-network data storage and retrieval in high genus 3D surface WSNs is also presented. Extensive simulations on several representative networks demonstrate that both algorithms work well on high genus 3D surface WSNs.",

    "abstract": "Data sharing among multiple sampling tasks significantly reduces energy consumption and communication cost in low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Conventional proposals have already scheduled the discrete point sampling tasks to decrease the amount of sampled data. However, less effort has been expended for applications that generate continuous interval sampling tasks. Moreover, most pioneering work limits its view to schedule sampling intervals of tasks on a single sensor node and neglects the process of task allocation in WSNs. Therefore, the gained efforts in prior work cannot benefit a large-scale WSN because the performance of a scheduling method is sensitive to the strategy of task allocation. Broadening the scope to an entire network, this article is the first work to maximize data sharing among continuous interval sampling tasks by jointly optimizing task allocation and scheduling of sampling intervals in WSNs. First, we formalize the joint optimization problem and prove it NP-hard. Second, we present the COMBINE operation, which is the crucial ingredient of our solution. COMBINE is a 2-factor approximate algorithm for maximizing data sharing among overlapping tasks. Furthermore, our heuristic named CATS is proposed. CATS is 2-factor approximate algorithm for jointly allocating tasks and scheduling sampling intervals so as to maximize data sharing in the entire network. Extensive empirical study is conducted on a testbed of 50 sensor nodes to evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. In addition, the scalability of our methods is verified by utilizing TOSSIM, a widely used simulation tool. The experimental results indicate that our methods successfully reduce the volume of sampled data and decrease energy consumption significantly.",

    "abstract": "As Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems become more ubiquitous in our daily lives, it necessitates the capability to measure the trustworthiness of the aggregate data from such systems to make fair decisions. However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance attitude of the concerned application. In addition, there exist varying levels of uncertainty associated with an evidence upon which a trust model is built. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms require some provisions to adapt to different risk attitudes and uncertainties. In this article, we propose a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that quantifies the trustworthiness of the collected data from IoT devices in the presence of adversaries who try to manipulate the data. In our proposed method, we consider an imperfect anomaly monitoring mechanism that tracks the transmitted data from each device and classifies the outcome (trustworthiness of data) as not compromised, compromised, or undecided . These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian inference model with three parameters. These parameters are then used for calculating a utility value via prospect theory to evaluate the reliability of the aggregate data at an IoT hub. In addition, to take into account different risk attitudes, we propose two types of fusion rule at IoT hub—optimistic and conservative. Furthermore, we put forward asymmetric weighted moving average scheme to measure the trustworthiness of aggregate data in presence of On-Off attacks. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulation experiments for both uniform and On-Off attacks. We show how trust scores vary under a variety of system factors like attack magnitude and inaccurate detection. In addition, we measure the trustworthiness of the aggregate data using the well-known expected utility theory and compare the results with that obtained by prospect theory. The simulation results reveal that prospect theory quantifies trustworthiness of the aggregate data better than expected utility theory.",

In this article, we present Pair-Navi, an infrastructure-free indoor navigation system that circumvents all these requirements by reusing a previous traveler’s (i.e., leader) trace experience to navigate future users (i.e., followers) in a Peer-to-Peer mode. Our system leverages the advances of visual simultaneous localization and mapping ( SLAM ) on commercial smartphones. Visual SLAM systems, however, are vulnerable to environmental dynamics in the precision and robustness and involve intensive computation that prohibits real-time applications. To combat environmental changes, we propose to cull non-rigid contexts and keep only the static and rigid contents in use. To enable real-time navigation on mobiles, we decouple and reorganize the highly coupled SLAM modules for leaders and followers. We implement Pair-Navi on commodity smartphones and validate its performance in three diverse buildings and two standard datasets (TUM and KITTI). Our results show that Pair-Navi achieves an immediate navigation success rate of 98.6%, which maintains as 83.4% even after 2 weeks since the leaders’ traces were collected, outperforming the state-of-the-art solutions by &gt;50%.

This article presents the design and implementation of Samba—an aquatic surveillance robot that integrates an off-the-shelf Android smartphone and a robotic fish to monitor harmful aquatic processes such as oil spills and harmful algal blooms. Using the built-in camera of the smartphone, Samba can detect spatially dispersed aquatic processes in dynamic and complex environment. To reduce the excessive false alarms caused by the nonwater area (e.g., trees on the shore), Samba segments the captured images and performs target detection in the identified water area only. However, a major challenge in the design of Samba is the high energy consumption resulted from continuous image segmentation. We propose a novel approach that leverages the power-efficient inertial sensors on smartphones to assist image processing. In particular, based on the learned mapping models between inertial and visual features, Samba uses real-time inertial sensor readings to estimate the visual features that guide image segmentation, significantly reducing the energy consumption and computation overhead. Samba also features a set of lightweight and robust computer vision algorithms, which detect harmful aquatic processes based on their distinctive color features. Last, Samba employs a feedback-based rotation control algorithm to adapt to spatiotemporal development of the target aquatic process. We have implemented a Samba prototype and evaluated it through extensive field experiments, lab experiments, and trace-driven simulations. The results show that Samba can achieve a 94% detection rate, a 5% false alarm rate, and a lifetime up to nearly 2 months.",

However, existing works for generating unrestricted adversary examples are quite inefficient and cannot achieve a high success rate. In this article, we explore an end-to-end and effective solution for unrestricted adversary example generation. To stabilize the training process and make our generative model converge to satisfactory results, we design a novel decoupled two-step efficient generative model (EGM), which contains a conditional reference generator and a conditional adversarial transformer. The former is responsible for generating reference samples from noises and source classes. The latter is responsible for converting the reference sample into adversarial examples corresponding to target classes. To improve the success rate, we design a new strategy, augmentation of adversarial labels to produce dynamic target labels and enhance the exploration ability of EGM. Such a strategy can be also applied to existing attacks to improve their attack success rates, which is of independent interest. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed model and demonstrate the necessity of decoupling the generation process in EGM. Experimental results show our EGM is much faster and achieves a higher success rate than the state-of-the-art attacks.",

Existing methods, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are suffering from two major drawbacks: sensitivity to environmental dynamics and over-dependence on certain activities. Thus, the challenge of solving such issues is how to validate human identities under different environments, even with different activities. Toward this goal, in this article, we develop WiTL, a transfer learning–based contactless authentication system, which works by simultaneously detecting unique human features and removing the environment dynamics contained in the signal data under different environments. To correctly detect human features (i.e., human heights used in this article), we design a Height EStimation (HES) algorithm based on Angle of Arrival (AoA). Furthermore, a transfer learning technology combined with the Residual Network (ResNet) and the adversarial network is devised to extract activity features and learn environmental independent representations. Finally, experiments through multi-activities and under multi-scenes are conducted to validate the performance of WiTL. Compared with the state-of-the-art contactless authentication systems, WiTL achieves a great accuracy over 93% and 97% in multi-scenes and multi-activities identity recognition, respectively.",

However, these cameras are usually equipped with heterogeneous and turbulent networks, making the real-time smooth playback of traffic monitoring videos with high quality a grand challenge. In this article, we propose a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning-based approach, namely, sRC-C (smart bitRate Control with a Continuous action space) , to enhance the quality of real-time traffic monitoring by adjusting the video bitrate adaptively. Distinguished from the existing bitrate adjusting approaches, sRC-C can overcome the bias incurred by deterministic discretization of candidate bitrates by adjusting the video bitrate with more fine-grained control from a continuous action space, thus significantly improving the Quality-of-Service (QoS). With carefully designed state space and neural network model, sRC-C can be implemented on cameras with scarce resources to support real-time live video streaming with low inference time. Extensive experiments show that sRC-C can reduce the frame loss counts and hold time by 24% and 15.5%, respectively, even with comparable bandwidth utilization. Meanwhile, compared to the-state-of-art approaches, sRC-C can improve the QoS by 30.4%.",

The integration of 5G and IoT technologies promote high availability, resilience, and reliability of the network infrastructures. IoT deployment optimization is the core issue of 5G IoT. Traditionally, IoT node deployment methods mostly used disk coverage model or probabilistic detection coverage model, which only utilizes the sensing capability of a single IoT node, which results in higher deployment costs. In this article, we study the network resilience of coverage estimation error and solve the coverage problem of resilient deployment of smart nodes in 5G IoT. The coverage formulation in the deployment optimization method is defined based on the confident information coverage (CIC). In order to obtain the optimal deployment with a given coverage quality and with a given budget, the mixed-integer linear programming models (CICILP-COST) and (CICILP-ERROR) are proposed based on the CIC model. After analyzing the model complexity, the proposed models are solved by the variable relaxation algorithm (CICVR-COST) and dichotomous search algorithm (CICDS-ERROR), respectively.

To solve this issue, we propose an effective scheduling algorithm for Impedance Matching–enhanced PDL optimization in MIMO MRC-WPT systems (called IMeP ), which integrates the transmitter scheduling together with the impedance matching techniques, i.e., adjusting TX coils for tuning TX-RX/TX-TX coupling and grouping RXs to separate strongly coupled RX pairs. We formulate this as a joint optimization problem and decouple it into three sub-problems, i.e., current scheduling, coil adjustment, and RX grouping. We then solve them through alternating direction method of multipliers–based, randomized beamforming–based, and graph clique cover–based algorithms, respectively. Extensive experiments are performed on a prototype testbed, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.

Our contributions include the mathematical formulation of this task mapping problem as mixed-integer programming that balances node energy consumption, enhancing data reliability, under real-time and energy constraints.

    "abstract": "Drones have drawn considerable attention as the agents in wireless data collection for agricultural applications, by virtue of their three-dimensional mobility and dominant line-of-sight communication channels. Existing works mainly exploit dedicated drones via deployment and maintenance, which is insufficient regarding resource and cost-efficiency. In contrast, leveraging existing delivery drones for the data collection on their way of delivery, called delivery drones’ piggybacking , is a promising solution. For achieving such cost-efficiency, drone scheduling inevitably stands in front, but the delivery missions involved have escalated it to a wholly different and unexplored problem. As an attempt, we first survey 514 delivery workers and conduct field experiments; noticeably, the collection cost, which mostly comes from the energy consumption of drones’ piggybacking, is determined by the decisions on package-route scheduling and data collection time distribution . Based on such findings, we build a new model that jointly optimizes these two decisions to maximize data collection amount, subject to the collection budget and delivery constraints. Further model analysis finds it a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming problem, which is NP-hard. The major challenge stems from interdependence entangling the two decisions. For this point, we propose Delta , a \\(\\frac{1}{9+\\delta } \\) -approximation delivery drone scheduling algorithm. The key idea is to devise an approximate collection time distribution scheme leveraging energy slicing, which transforms the complex problem with two interdependent variables into a submodular function maximization problem only with one variable . The theoretical proofs and extensive evaluations verify the effectiveness and the near-optimal performance of Delta .",

    "abstract": "Recently, wireless sensing techniques have been widely used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Unlike traditional device-based sensing, wireless sensing is contactless, pervasive, low cost, and non-invasive, making it highly suitable for relevant IoT applications. However, most existing methods are highly dependent on high-quality datasets, and the minority class will not achieve a satisfactory performance when suffering from a class imbalance problem. In this article, we propose a time–frequency semantic generative adversarial network framework (i.e., TFSemantic) to address the imbalanced classification problem in human activity recognition using radio frequency (RF) signals. Specifically, the TFSemantic framework can learn semantic features from the minority classes and then generate high-quality signals to restore data balance. It includes a data pre-processing module, a semantic extraction module, a semantic distribution module, and a data augmenter module. In the data pre-processing module, we process four different RF datasets (i.e., WiFi, RFID, UWB, and mmWave). We also develop Fourier semantic feature convolution and attention semantic feature embedding methods for the semantic extraction module. A discrete wavelet transform is utilized for reconstructed RF samples in the semantic distribution module. In data augmenter module, we design an associated loss function to achieve effective adversarial training. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed TFSemantic framework using different RF datasets, which outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Coverage and connectivity are the major performance metrics that reflect the quality of service provided by heterogeneous planar wireless sensor networks (PWSNs) monitoring a planar field of interest (PFoI), where the deployed sensors may not necessarily have the same capabilities in terms of their sensing range, communication range, and maximum battery power capacity. Precisely, coverage is considered as the main functionality of PWSNs, which is meaningful only when connectivity is guaranteed. Therefore, it is important that both coverage and connectivity be jointly considered in the deployment of heterogeneous PWSNs. In order to account for joint coverage and connectivity, we propose to solve the problem of connected k -coverage in heterogeneous PWSNs, where every point in a PFoI is covered by at least k sensors simultaneously, while all the deployed sensors are mutually connected, either directly or indirectly, with k &gt; 1. While most existing studies of this problem focus on homogeneous sensors, which have the same above-mentioned capabilities ( i.e. , initial energy, sensing range, and communication range), our study in this paper considers heterogeneous ones. More specifically, we propose a hierarchical (or multi-tier) deployment of heterogeneous sensors in a square FoI, which is divided into concentric square bands with the same width difference to achieve k -coverage of this PFoI. Based on this multi-tier sensor deployment and the slicing of a square FoI into square bands for k -coverage, we establish the necessary relationship for connectivity among the sensors located in adjacent bands. Finally, we propose our heterogeneous k -coverage protocol and validate our theoretical analysis using simulation results. We find that the deployment of heterogeneous sensors helps achieve much better results compared to those obtained using homogeneous sensors. Furthermore, our proposed protocol outperforms an existing connected k -coverage protocol for heterogeneous PWSNs with respect to various performance metrics.",

To move beyond these limitations, we present EfficientGaze, a resource-efficient framework for gaze representation learning. We introduce the frequency-domain gaze estimation, which exploits the feature extraction capability and the spectral compaction property of discrete cosine transform to substantially reduce the computational cost of gaze estimation systems for both calibration and inference. Moreover, to overcome the data labeling hurdle, we design a novel multi-task gaze-aware contrastive learning framework to learn gaze representations that are generic across subjects in an unsupervised manner. Our evaluation on two gaze estimation datasets demonstrates that EfficientGaze achieves comparable gaze estimation performance to existing supervised learning-based approaches, while enabling up to 6.80 times and 1.67 times speedup in system calibration and gaze estimation, respectively.",

While several countermeasures have been proposed to detect the occurrence of the inaudible attack passively, accurately locating the attack source in 3D free space remains an unresolved challenge. Arrow is designed to bridge this gap by attempting to detect the occurrence of inaudible attacks and determine their localization simultaneously. Instead of relying on dedicated hardware components, Arrow is implemented with the microphone array widely deployed on COTS(Commercial Off-The-Shelf) smart speakers. Throughout the spatial information captured by the microphone array, Arrow establishes a spatial mapping model and derives orientation-related features to pinpoint the location of the attack source. Furthermore, to improve the robustness against co-channel interference, Arrow adopt carefully-modulated ultrasonic waveforms to achieve noise-robust attack detection. Through the above technical mechanism, Arrow can significantly improve the security level of voice assistants on smart speakers with nearly zero deployment cost. We implement a prototype of Arrow and conduct comprehensive performance evaluation. The results show Arrow can achieve 2.5° and 7° error in DoA estimation for horizontal and vertical angles, respectively.",

However, in complex urban environments, existing routing protocols face challenges such as severe attenuation of wireless signals, inefficiency of the three-handshake mechanism, and low reusability of multi-hop links, These issues drastically affect the performance of routing protocols. To address these problems, this paper develops an edge intelligence-enabled routing protocol (EIRP), integrating link optimization and packet routing. The proposed EIRP consists of three key components. Firstly, we propose a traffic awareness-based multi-hop link construction scheme to construct and maintain links among interactions according to traffic conditions. The primary goal of this scheme is to establish stable links before message transmission to improve its efficiency. Secondly, we design a multi-hop link scheduling scheme to enhance data transmission performance and improve the utility of the constructed multi-hop links. Thirdly, we propose a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based packet routing scheme, leveraging individual rewards to address the sparse rewards challenge. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed EIRP. The results demonstrate that EIRP significantly improves the packet delivery rate and ensures low communication delay in various urban scenarios.",

By quantifying the sensing and communication performance of RSUs, we construct a user association and resource allocation model with the optimisation objective of maximising the average sensing performance and communication performance of the system.

    "abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), substantial research efforts have been devoted to extending the sensing capability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. State-of-the-art approaches either demand sophisticated hardware redesign or are constrained to specific sensing capability, leading to increased costs and limited scalability. In this paper, we present the design of a generic sensor tag (GS-Tag) based on RF switches and COTS RFID system for transmission of generic sensor data. RF switches are connected in parallel with the RFID chip, and the GS-Tag modulates the sensor data by controlling the RF switches. Specifically, with the RF switches turned on, the tag’s chip is short-circuited, rendering it unreadable; conversely, turning off the RF switches makes the tag readable. The reader demodulates the data through the compatible electronic product code (EPC) protocol. A subtle dual RF switch scheme is adopted to extend the communication range. In addition to the battery-powered solution, we integrate an RF energy-harvesting module, develop a high-efficiency energy management circuit, and design an efficient task scheduling strategy to enable the GS-Tag to operate in a battery-free mode. We implement a prototype of GS-Tag with COTS RFID devices. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our designed GS-Tag can achieve an average packet reception rate (PRR) exceeding 99%, exhibits robustness to environmental disturbance, and facilitates coexistence of six GS-Tags with an average PRR of over 91%. Due to the dual RF switch scheme, the communication range of GS-Tag extends to 12 m. Besides, GS-Tag has an extremely low power consumption of just 3.98 μ W. A practical application is developed to accurately monitor temperature and ambient light intensity in an office environment while maintaining low power consumption. Our designed GS-Tag presents a cost-effective and compatible solution for expanding the sensing capabilities of COTS RFID system.",

It gradually distributes a firmware image to EH LoRa sensors in an energy-neutral manner according to their future energy availability predicted using embedded machine learning models. Consequently, the need for additional firmware distributions caused by unsuccessful firmware image reconstructions is reduced. Through one-hop neighbor discovery, on-demand relay, flexible energy query, and coverage assessment mechanisms, FioRa+ ensures that all EH LoRa sensors can receive data fragments from the server at the scheduled time using high data rates. Equipped with a relay scheduling algorithm, it circumvents the collision of data fragments relayed by EH LoRa sensors using identical data rates.

Initially, we revisit existing solutions and empirically observe the presence of sharp minima in trained long-tailed WiFi-based HAR models. Consequently, we propose a novel method called Class Region Flattening ( CRF ) to identify class-conditional flat minima. This approach effectively mitigates bias caused by the long-tailed distribution and enhances generalization capabilities in the face of changing circumstances.

To address this, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed to supplement spectrum resources temporarily. This paper proposes a UAV-assisted Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) system, integrating UAVs to enhance RSU capabilities in congested scenarios. Traditional spectrum sensing techniques, however, struggle to autonomously monitor vehicular movements and maintain stable spectrum performance. To overcome this, we introduce radar sensing devices into the RSUs to improve perception accuracy and consistency. The integration of radar sensors, while beneficial, creates additional competition for limited system resources. We, therefore, formulate the resource allocation problem considering computation delay, communication rate, and perception data, constrained by spectrum resources, offloading decisions, and time-slot allocations. The problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and we propose an Improved Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (IMAPPO) algorithm to optimize resource allocation under these constraints.

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating the velocity (including speed and direction) of moving targets has recently attracted widespread attention in augmented reality, security monitoring and sports health. In particular, the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS)-based velocity estimation schemes using WiFi devices have shown great potential and have been widely studied. However, previous Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based and path-parameter-based arts have inherent limitations in DFS estimation and, worse still, ignore the nonlinear measurement errors caused by the relative orientation between the moving target and the WiFi transceiver. The above limitations make it difficult to meet the requirements for fine-grained velocity estimation in practical applications. To cope with these limitations, in this paper, we propose a learning-based velocity estimation framework, named freeDoppler , to achieve fine-grained, multi-target and orientation-independent velocity estimation. Specifically, we construct a WiFi-based Velocity Estimation Network (VEN), which leverages continuous complex-valued Channel State Information (CSI) sequences as input, to fully learn the inherent information of the Doppler effect and accurately predict velocity series. In addition, we adopt the electric field scattering model of Maxwell’s equations to construct a physics-informed CSI Generation Model (CGM), thereby generating large-scale and high-quality simulated CSI samples to improve the generalization of the VEN model. Throughout extensive real-world experiments, freeDoppler can achieve median errors of 7.98 cm/s for speed estimation, 28° for direction estimation and 35 cm for human tracking in one or two moving targets, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.",

First, the time-indexed storage problem is formally defined and two formulations are presented seeking to optimize generic utility functions that are derived from concerns about energy, bandwidth usage, and storage balancing. We present and analyze decentralized protocols to solve these formulations and prove the optimality of some of our solutions. Secondly, maintenance and use of simple overlays among rendezvous point nodes in order to enable fault-tolerant and efficient time-indexed queries are discussed. Finally, simulation results are presented to quantify performance characteristics of the protocols, and we find that our proposed scheme has low query overhead that scales with system size and density while exhibiting very good load-balancing and fault-tolerance properties.

    "abstract": "The efficient management of scarce network resources, including energy and bandwidth, represents a central challenge for wireless sensor networks. The current trend in resource management relies on the introduction of control mechanisms, such as control message exchanges, node-specific addressing, and storage of partial network state information. These mechanisms typically incur communication and processing overhead that does not scale well for larger or denser networks. Instead of introducing control mechanisms for network resource management, this article proposes and evaluates a Directed Broadcast with Overhearing (DBO) approach for sensor networks that combines directed broadcast at the network layer with CSMA and packet overhearing at the MAC layer. Through avoidance of control messaging and exchange of network state information, DBO trades off limited packet duplication overhead for control messaging overhead. This article introduces an analytical model that provides the basis for DBO evaluation and for analysis of the approach's transient packet retransmissions, route convergence, and energy consumption in the average and worst cases. We also present the model implementation details and the simulation experiments that explore the suitability of DBO for networks of different sizes with three different radio models that vary the width of grey regions, and we compare DBO's energy consumption against conventional unicast beacon-based and snooping-based routing protocols. The results indicate that that DBO's route convergence requires an average of five hops for ideal radio reception, seven hops for narrow grey regions, and twelve hops for wide grey regions. These results confirm that DBO shifts energy consumption from critical nodes near the base station to nodes near the source. The overall energy consumption of limited packet duplication overhead with DBO compared to unicast routing shrinks for medium- to large-size networks, rendering it more favorable than conventional communication approaches for large and dense sensor networks.",

At each sensor node u , we compute O (log n ) aggregates about exponentially enlarging neighborhoods centered at u . The i th aggregate is the aggregated data from nodes approximately within 2 i hops of u . We present a scheme, named the hierarchical spatial gossip algorithm , to extract and construct these aggregates, for all sensors simultaneously, with a total communication cost of O ( n polylog n ). The hierarchical gossip algorithm adopts atomic communication steps with each node choosing to exchange information with a node distance d away with probability ∼ 1/ d 3 . The attractiveness of the algorithm can be attributed to its simplicity, low communication cost, distributed nature, and robustness to node failures and link failures. We show in addition that computing multiresolution aggregates precisely (i.e., each aggregate uses all and only the nodes within 2 i hops) requires a communication cost of Ω( n √ n ), which does not scale well with network size. An approximate range in aggregate computation like that introduced by the gossip mechanism is therefore necessary in a scalable efficient algorithm. Besides the natural applications of multiresolution data summaries in data validation and information mining, we also demonstrate the application of the precomputed multiresolution data summaries in answering range queries efficiently.",

    "abstract": "As many radio chips used in today’s sensor mote hardware can work at different frequencies, several multichannel communication protocols have recently been proposed to improve network throughput and reduce packet loss for wireless sensor networks. However, existing work cannot utilize multiple channels to provide explicit guarantees for application-specified end-to-end communication delays, which are critical to many real-time applications such as surveillance and disaster response. In this article, we propose MCRT, a multichannel real-time communication protocol that features a flow-based channel allocation strategy. Because of the small number of orthogonal channels available in current mote hardware, MCRT allocates channels to network partitions formed based on many-to-one data flows. To achieve bounded end-to-end communication delay for every data flow, the channel allocation problem has been formulated as a constrained optimization problem and proven to be NP-complete. We then present the design of MCRT, which includes a channel allocation algorithm and a real-time packet forwarding strategy. Extensive simulation results based on a realistic radio model and empirical results on a real hardware testbed of Tmote nodes both demonstrate that MCRT can effectively utilize multiple channels to reduce the number of deadlines missed in end-to-end communications. Our results also show that MCRT outperforms a state-of-the-art real-time protocol and two baseline multichannel communication schemes.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, variety of sensors including inexpensive, low-precision sensors with sufficient computing and communication capabilities are increasingly deployed for monitoring large geographical areas. One of the problems with the use of inexpensive sensors is that they often suffer from random or systematic errors such as drift. The sensor drift is the result of slow changes that occur in the measurement driven by aging, loss of calibration, and changes in the phenomena being monitored over a time period. These drifting sensors need to be calibrated automatically for continuous and reliable monitoring. Existing methods for drift detection and correction do not consider the measurement errors or uncertainties present in those inexpensive low-precision sensors, hence, resulting in unreliable drift estimates. In this article, we propose a novel framework to automatically detect and correct the drifts by employing Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) and Kalman filtering (KF) techniques. The BME method is a spatiotemporal estimation method that incorporates the measurement errors of low-precision sensors as interval quantities along with the high-precision sensor measurements in their computations. Our scheme can be implemented in a centralized as well as in a distributed manner to detect and correct the drift generated in the sensors. For the centralized scheme, we compare several Kriging-based estimation techniques in combination with KF, and show the superiority of our proposed BME-based method in detecting and correcting the drift. We also propose a multivariate BME framework for drift detection, in which multiple features can be used to improve the drift estimates. To demonstrate the applicability of our distributed approach on a real-world application scenario, we implemented our algorithm on each wireless sensor node in order to perform in-network drift detection. The evaluation on real IoT datasets gathered from an indoor and an outdoor deployments reveal the superiority of our method in correctly identifying and correcting the drifts that develop in the sensors, in real time, compared to the existing approaches in the literature.",

We propose a new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation.

Specifically, ECT can dynamically change the nodes’ priorities and reduce the delivery delay from high-priority nodes under unreliable links. The key idea of ECT is to leverage the concurrent transmission of important data and raw data from ZigBee nodes to the WiFi access point. We extensively evaluate ECT under different network settings, and results show that our ECT’s packet delivery delay is more than 29 times lower than the current state-of-the-art solution.",

Since each sensor platform is typically equipped with limited main memory and sensor data, as well as the fact that queries are temporal, existing flash index or file systems for general portable devices are not suitable for sensor networks. We propose Time-Log Tree (TL-Tree), a novel unbalanced and cascaded structure, that takes advantage of available flash capacity while making use of the time-series property as a primary feature for optimizing both memory and energy constraints. Extensive experiments show TL-Tree's ability to utilize both flash capacity and temporal locality to support sensor data processing. Compared to other schemes, it achieves much better access and energy savings for different kinds of random and temporal range queries. In addition, TL-Tree can also be easily extended to support value-based queries. We have developed a hardware board that includes a raw 128MB NAND flash chip on MicaZ mote. We have also implemented a flash driver and the TL-Tree to demonstrate the practicality of this idea.",

The capacity in our analysis is the end-to-end per-node throughput. We analyze the typical traffic pattern for sensor networks, where traffics are destined to or originated from the sink. The main results of our analysis are summarized as follows. (1) The network capacity is O (1/ N ) for both omni and directional antennas, where N is the number of sensor nodes in the network. (2) In the case of line deployment, the capacity ratio of directional antennas over omni antennas is bounded by (2 q +3)/(2 q -1), where q is the ratio of the interference radius to the transmission radius. (3) In the case of two-dimensional deployment, the capacity for using directional antennas is O (1/θ) for m = 2, and O (lg m /θ 2 lg(1/θ)) for m &gt; 2, where m is the number of radios (antennas) on each node and θ is the beamwidth of antennas. (4) When there are n &gt; 1 sinks, the capacity has a non-monotonic relationship with the transmission radius. The optimal transmission radius depends on the ratio of n/q .

We propose to address this problem using a divide and conquer approach: the network is divided into convex pieces by a distributed convex partitioning protocol, using connectivity information only. A convex network partition exhibits some desirable properties that allow traditional algorithms to work to their full advantage. Based on this, we can achieve relatively high performance for an algorithm by combining algorithmic actions within individual partitions. We consider two important applications: virtual-coordinate-based geographic routing and connectivity-based localization. The former benefits from convex partition's friendliness to network embedding, which is crucial to generating accurate virtual coordinates for the nodes, while the latter leverages the fact that shortest paths are largely straight for node pairs within a convex partition. Experimental results show that the convex partition approach can significantly improve the performance of both applications in comparison with state-of-the-art solutions.",

While prior work often targets low-end sensor networks, this article introduces a novel diagnostic tool, called the telediagnostic powertracer, geared for remote high-end sensing systems. Leveraging special properties of high-end systems, this in situ troubleshooting tool uses external power measurements to determine the internal health condition of an unresponsive node and the most likely cause of its failure. We develop our own low-cost power meter with low-bandwidth radio, propose both passive and active sampling schemes to measure the power consumption of the host node, and then report the measurements to a base station, hence allowing remote (i.e., tele-) diagnosis. The tool was deployed and tested in a remote solar-powered sensing system for acoustic and visual environmental monitoring. It was shown to successfully distinguish between several categories of failures that cause unresponsive behavior including energy depletion, antenna damage, radio disconnection, system crashes, and anomalous reboots. It was also able to determine the internal health conditions of an unresponsive node, such as the presence or absence of sensing and data storage activities (for each of multiple applications). The article explores the feasibility of building such a remote diagnostic tool from the standpoint of economy, scale, and diagnostic accuracy. The main novelty lies in its use of power consumption as a side channel, which has more availability than other I/O ports, to diagnose sensing system failures.",

This makes the design of a suitable model that combines the different dynamics at different time scales a nontrivial problem. We propose a novel multilevel approach, the M&amp;M model, involving hidden Markov models (HMMs) and mixtures of multivariate Bernoullis (MMBs) for modeling the long and short time-scale behavior of wireless links from 802.15.4 test beds. We characterize the synthetic traces generated from our model of the wireless link in terms of the mean and variance of the packet reception rates from the data traces, comparison of distributions of run lengths, and conditional packet delivery functions of successive packet receptions (1's) and losses (0's). Our results show that when compared to the closest-fit pattern matching model in TOSSIM, the proposed modeling approach is able to mimic the behavior of the data traces quite closely, with differences in packet reception rates of the empirical and simulated traces of less than 1.9%; on average and 6.6% in the worst case. Moreover, the simulated links from our proposed approach were able to account for long runs of 1's and 0's as observed in empirical data traces.",

    "abstract": "We consider the energy efficiency of collecting sparse data in wireless sensor networks using compressive sensing (CS). We use a sparse random matrix as the sensing matrix, which we call Sparse Random Sampling (SRS). In SRS, only a randomly selected subset of nodes, called the source nodes, are required to report data to the sink. Given the source nodes, we intend to construct a data gathering tree such that (1) it is rooted at the sink and spans every source node and (2) the minimum residual energy of the tree nodes after the data collection is maximized. We first show that this problem is NP-complete and then develop a polynomial time algorithm to approximately solve the problem. We greedily construct a sequence of data gathering trees over multiple rounds and propose a polynomial-time algorithm to collect linearly combined measurements at each round. We show that the proposed algorithm is provably near-optimal. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm excels not only in increasing the minimum residual energy, but also in extending the network lifetime.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of ever-more-capable mobile devices, especially smartphones, brings forth participatory sensing to collect and interpret information. It can achieve unprecedented quantity of data. However, it is arduous to guarantee quality of data because everyone can contribute data without scrutinization. It is an important issue in quality-oriented participatory sensing. Our idea to address this issue is motivating participants to contribute accurate data for improving data quality directly. In this article, we propose a reputation-based incentive mechanism, RIM, to realize the idea. More specifically, we identify the participants who collect the accurate data and regard them as the reputable ones. Then, the reputable participants are granted a higher chance to obtain rewards so that other people will try to follow such users and become reputable as well. Namely, RIM can encourage and steer users to collect accurate data in the long term. We analyze our incentive mechanism by formalization and premise implications. For a feasibility study of participatory sensing and verification of the implications, we implement and deploy a participatory sensing application focusing on monitoring environmental noise in a specific location as a case study and conduct a simulation based on the case study to further evaluate the proposed incentive mechanism. The results from the case study and the simulation present that RIM can remarkably increase the quality of collected data in participatory sensing while corroborating our theoretical implications.",

Energy denial-of-service (DoS) attack where a remote attacker exhausts the victim’s battery via networking remains a critical challenge for the device availability. While prior literature proposes mitigation- and detection-based solutions, we propose to eliminate the vulnerability entirely by offloading the power requirements to the entity who makes the networking requests. To do so, we build communication channels using wireless charging signals (as opposed to the traditional radio-frequency signals), so that the communication and the power transfer are simultaneous and inseparable, and use the channels to build power-positive networking (PPN). PPN also offloads the computation-based costs to the requester, enabling authentication and other tasks considered too power-hungry for battery-operated devices. In this article, we study the energy DoS attack impacts on off-the-shelf embedded system platforms (Raspberry Pi and the ESP 8266 system-on-chip (SoC) module), present PPN, implement and build a Qi-charging-technology-compatible prototype, and use the prototype for evaluations and analyses. Our prototype, built on the hardware already available for wireless charging, effectively defends against energy DoS and supports simultaneous power and data transfer.",

Since Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) MAC eliminates the collision occurrence and seeks the minimization of the number of time-slots assigned to each node, the energy consumption of the nodes is reduced. Furthermore, with the proper allocation of the time-slots to the nodes, the transmission delay can be significantly reduced. In this article, we propose TDMA scheduling algorithm for Cluster-tree topology WSNs that meets the timeliness and the energy demands. The algorithm adopts an elegant approach that expresses the timing constraints of the data transmissions as an integer multiple of the length of the schedule period. Moreover, since the distributed algorithm is well-suited to the scarce resources of the WSNs, we focus on the distributed methods that allow each cluster to come up with its allocated time-slots. The algorithm is based on graph theory, such as distributed shortest path, distributed topological ordering, and distributed graph coloring algorithms. The efficiency of the algorithm, regarding the elapsed time to construct the schedule and the energy consumption, is evaluated over benchmark instances up to several thousands of nodes.",

These systems often encounter the heterogeneity and randomness of ambient energy. Meanwhile, the energy storage unit, such as the battery or capacitor, has the inherent property of imperfect charge efficiency λ (λ ≤ 1), which is usually low when the power of the ambient energy is weak or variable. These features bring new challenges in using the harvested energy efficiently. This article calls it the stochastic duty cycling problem and studies it under three cases—offline, online, and correlated stochastic duty cycling—to maximize utilization efficiency. We design an offline algorithm 1 for the offline case with optimal performance. An approximation algorithm with the ratio 1 − e −γ is designed for the online case. By adding initial negotiation among devices, we present a correlated algorithm and prove its approximation ratio theoretically. Experiment evaluation on our real energy harvesting platform shows that the offline algorithm performs over the other two algorithms. The correlated algorithm may not perform over the online one under the impacts of the three metrics: heterogeneity, charge efficiency, and energy harvesting probability.",

Due to the burgeoning growth in Internet applications, multiple application queries can exhibit overlapping in their functional requirements, such as the region of interest, sensing attributes, and sensing time duration. This overlapping results in redundant sensing tasks generation leading to the increased overall network traffic and energy consumption. Existing approaches operate on data sharing among various tasks to minimize the upstream traffic. However, no existing work attempts to prevent the redundant task generation to reduce the downstream traffic. Moreover, the allocation of suitable sensor nodes to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the queries is still an open issue. This article proposes an end-to-end query processing framework (named, QueryPM) that first, calculates the functional requirements similarity among queries to prevent the redundant task generation. Then, it takes the QoS and functional requirements into account while allocating the tasks on the sensor nodes. Extensive simulations on the proposed approach show that downstream traffic, upstream traffic, and energy consumption reduced to 60%, 20--40%, and 40%, respectively, as compared to state-of-the-art mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) badly harms the transmission reliability for low-power networks such as ZigBee at 2.4-GHz band. Though promising, channel hopping still faces challenges because the increasingly dense deployment of CTI leaves very few available channels. Selecting a good channel with the least overhead is crucial but challenging. Most of the existing works are heuristic methods that choose a channel far from the current one to avoid adjacent channels that may be correlatively interfered by CTI with a wider bandwidth such as WiFi. However, we observe that the correlated channels influenced by the same CTI source do not necessarily have the same channel qualities and even the opposite state, due to the uneven spectrum power density of CTI. Such channel opportunities are unexplored and wasted. In this article, we propose CoHop, a quantitative correlation-based channel hopping method for low-power wireless networks. We establish a quantitative model that describes the correlation of channel qualities to capture channel opportunities and calculate channel quality without probing, to reduce probing overhead. The probing sequence is optimized based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and the prediction-based probing algorithm. We implement CoHop on TinyOS and evaluate its performance in various environments. The experimental results show that CoHop can increase the Packet Reception Ratio by 80%, compared with existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting human poses given a sequence of historical pose frames has several important applications, especially in the domain of smart home safety. Recently, computer vision-based human pose forecasting has made a breakthrough using deep learning technology. However, to implement a practical system deployed on an IoT edge environment, there are still two issues to be addressed. First, existing methods on pose forecasting fail to model the coherent structural information of connected human joints and thus cannot achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy, especially for long-term predictions. Second, a general and static pre-trained prediction model may not perform well in the deployment environment due to the visual domain shift problem. In this article, we propose a hybrid cloud-edge system called GPFS to solve those issues. Specifically, we first introduce a novel graph convolutional neural network (GCN)-based sequence-to-sequence learning method, which enhances the sequence encoder by using a graph to represent both the spatial and temporal connections of the human joints in the input frames. The GCN improves the forecasting accuracy by capturing the motion pattern of each joint as well as the correlations among different human joints over time. Second, to address the domain shift issue and protect data privacy, we extend the system to perform online learning on the IoT edge to adapt the cloud trained general model with online collected on-site domain data. Extensive evaluation on Human 3.6M and Penn Action datasets demonstrates the superiority of our proposed system.",

The phenomena detection and tracking should not be limited to some traditional applications such as oil spills and gas clouds but also be utilized to more accurately observe other types of phenomena such as walking motion of people. This wider range of applications requires more reliable, in-situ techniques that can accurately adapt to the dynamics of phenomena. Unfortunately, existing works which only focus on simple and well-defined shapes of phenomena are no longer sufficient. In this article, we present a new class of applications together with several distributed algorithms to detect and track phenomena clouds, regardless of their shapes and movement direction. We first propose a distributed algorithm for in-situ detection and tracking of phenomena clouds in a sensor space. We next provide a mathematical model to optimize the energy consumption, on which we further propose a localized algorithm to minimize the resource utilization. Our proposed approaches not only ensure low processing and networking overhead at the centralized query processor but also minimize the number of sensors which are actively involved in the detection and tracking processes. We validate our approach using both real-life smart home applications and simulation experiments, which confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. We also show that our algorithms result in significant reduction in resource usage and power consumption as compared to contemporary stream-based approaches.",

Event detection systems are also challenged to provide a generic system that efficiently adapts to environmental dynamics and works easily with a range of applications, machine learning approaches, and sensor modalities. Consequently, we propose Watchdog, a modality-agnostic event detection framework that clusters the right sensors to meet user-specified detection accuracy during runtime while significantly reducing energy consumption. Watchdog can use different machine learning techniques to learn the sensing capability of a heterogeneous sensor deployment and meet accuracy requirements. To address environmental dynamics and ensure energy savings, Watchdog wakes up and puts to sleep sensors as needed to meet user-specified accuracy.

To find a stronger result, we define a new vertex-based random connection model that is of independent interest. Following a proof technique of Penrose [1991], we prove that when the density of the nodes approaches infinity, then a finite component of size greater than 1 exists with probability 0 in this model. We use this result to obtain an optimal condition on node transmission radius that is both necessary and sufficient to achieve connectivity and is hence optimal . The optimality of such a radius is also tested via simulation for two specific duty-cycle schemes, called the contiguous and the random selection duty-cycle schemes. Finally, we design a minimum-radius duty-cycling scheme that achieves connectivity with a transmission radius arbitrarily close to the one required in random geometric graphs. The overhead in this case is that we have to spend some time computing the schedule.",

    "abstract": "Most existing work on coverage, connectivity, and geographic forwarding considers a two-dimensional (2D) space, where the sensors are deployed in a 2D field. However, there are several cases where the 2D assumption is not valid for the design of those types of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), such as underwater sensor deployment and sensors deployed on the trees of different heights in a forest. In this article, we investigate the problem of k -coverage in three-dimensional (3D) WSNs, where each point in a 3D field is covered by at least k sensors simultaneously. Moreover, it is commonly assumed in most of the work on the problem of geographic forwarding in WSNs that all the sensors are always on (or active) during the network operational lifetime, and, particularly, during data forwarding. However, this type of design is neither practical nor efficient for the sensors whose energy is crucial and limited. Therefore, we consider geographic forwarding in 3D duty-cycled k -covered WSNs, where the sensors can switch between on and off states (i.e., duty-cycled sensors) to save energy. First, we provide a rigorous analysis of the k -coverage problem in 3D WSNs using Helly's Theorem and the Reuleaux tetrahedron model, and compute the sensor spatial density to k -cover a 3D field. Second, based on this analysis, we compute a lower bound and an upper bound on the number of overlapping Reuleaux tetrahedra that are necessary to fill a 3D convex shape, such as the sensing sphere of a sensor. Third, using these results, we present a localized (i.e., based on local information of one-hop neighbors), pseudo-distributed (i.e., not fully distributed) protocol to achieve k -coverage of a 3D field with a reduced number of active sensors, while ensuring connectivity between them. Fourth, we discuss our composite geographic forwarding protocol for 3D duty-cycled k -covered WSNs using a combination of deterministic and opportunistic schemes to forward sensed data towards the sink. We will study the problem of 3D space filling (or space covering) in the context of the above-mentioned problems in 3D WSNs. Fifth, we relax two widely used assumptions, namely sensor homogeneity and sensing range convexity, to generalize our k -coverage protocol in 3D space. Last, we show several simulation results of our framework for joint k -cov erage and com posite geographic for warding in 3D duty-cycled WSNs, called 3D- k Cov-ComFor .

    "abstract": "As an emerging mobility-on-demand service, bike-sharing system (BSS) has spread all over the world by providing a flexible, cost-efficient, and environment-friendly transportation mode for citizens. Demand-supply unbalance is one of the main challenges in BSS because of the inefficiency of the existing bike repositioning strategy, which reallocates bikes according to a pre-defined periodic schedule without considering the highly dynamic user demands. While reinforcement learning has been used in some repositioning problems for mitigating demand-supply unbalance, there are significant barriers when extending it to BSS due to the dimension curse of action space resulting from the dynamic number of workers and bikes in the city. In this paper, we study these barriers and address them by proposing a novel bike repositioning system, namely BikeBrain, which consists of a demand prediction model and a spatio-temporal bike repositioning algorithm. Specifically, to obtain accurate and real-time usage demand for efficient bike repositioning, we first present a prediction model ST-NetPre, which directly predicts user demand considering the highly dynamic spatio-temporal characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a spatio-temporal cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning method (ST-CBR) for learning the worker-based bike repositioning strategy in which each worker in BSS is considered an agent. Especially, ST-CBR adopts the centralized learning and decentralized execution way to achieve effective cooperation among large-scale dynamic agents based on Mean Field Reinforcement Learning (MFRL), while avoiding the huge dimension of action space. For dynamic action space, ST-CBR utilizes a SoftMax selector to select the specific action. Meanwhile, for the benefits and costs of agents’ operation, an efficient reward function is designed to seek an optimal control policy considering both immediate and future rewards. Extensive experiments are conducted based on large-scale real-world datasets, and the results have shown significant improvements of our proposed method over several state-of-the-art baselines on the demand-supply gap and operation cost measures.",

    "abstract": "Visual target detection based on deep learning with high computing power devices has been successful, but the performance in intelligent agriculture with edge devices has not been prominent. Specifically, the existing model architecture and optimization methods are not well-suited to low-power edge devices, the agricultural tasks such as weed detection require high accuracy, short inference latency, and low cost. Although there are automated tuning methods available, the search space is extremely large, using existing models for compression and optimization greatly wastes tuning resources. In this article, we propose a lightweight PAM-FOG net based on weed distribution and projection mapping. More significantly, we propose a novel model compression optimization method to fit our model. Compared with other models, PAM-FOG net runs on smart weeding robots supported by edge devices, and achieves superior accuracy and high frame rate. We effectively balance model size, performance and inference speed, reducing the original model size by nearly 50%, power consumption by 26%, and improving the frame rate by 40%. It shows the effectiveness of our model architecture and optimization method, which provides a reference for the future development of deep learning in intelligent agriculture.",

However, Android users oftentimes suffer from app crashes, which directly disrupt user experience and could lead to data loss. Till now, the community have limited understanding of their prevalence, characteristics, and root causes. In this article, we make an in-depth study of the crash events regarding ten very popular apps of different genres, based on fine-grained system-level traces crowd-sourced from 93 million Android devices. We find that app crashes occur prevalently on the various hardware models studied, and better hardware does not seem to essentially relieve the problem. Most importantly, we unravel multi-fold root causes of app crashes, and pinpoint that the most crashes stem from the subtle yet crucial inconsistency between app developers’ supposed memory/process management model and Android’s actual implementations. We design practical approaches to addressing the inconsistency; after large-scale deployment, they reduce 40.4% of the app crashes with negligible system overhead. In addition, we summarize important lessons learned from this study, and have released our measurement code/data to the community.",

However, floating LoRa networks suffer from serious performance degradation due to the polarization loss caused by the swaying antenna. Existing methods that only control the transmission starting from the aligned attitude have limited improvement due to the ignorance of aligned period length. In this article, we propose PolarScheduler , a dynamic transmission control method for floating LoRa networks. PolarScheduler actively controls transmission configurations to match polarization aligned periods. We propose a V-zone model to capture diverse aligned periods under different configurations. We also design a low-cost model establishment method and an efficient optimal configuration searching algorithm to make full use of aligned periods. To deal with packet collisions in a multiple-node environment, we further propose an Attitude-aware Slot-allocation MAC protocol, which avoids both packet collisions and polarization loss. We implement PolarScheduler on commercial LoRa platforms and evaluate its performance in a deployed network. Extensive experiments show that PolarScheduler can improve the packet delivery rate and throughput by up to 20.0% and 15.7%, compared to the state-of-the-art method.",

To solve this problem, we propose FedUSL (Federated Unified Space Learning), a federated annotation method for multimodal sensing data in the driving fatigue detection scenario, which has the innate ability to exploit more than four multimodal data simultaneously for correlations and complementary with low complexity. To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, we first collect the multimodal data (aka, camera, physiological sensor) through simulated fatigue driving. The data is then preprocessed and features are extracted to form a usable multimodal dataset. Based on the dataset, we analyze the performance of the proposed method.

Notably, extant research mainly employs methods such as deep learning and reinforcement learning to make resource allocation decisions, without adequately accounting for the ramifications of high-speed mobility of vehicles and the dynamic nature of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) on the decision-making process. This paper endeavours to tackle the aforementioned issue through the introduction of a novel concept, namely, a digital twin-assisted IoV. Among them, the digital twin of IoV offers training data for computational offloading and content caching decisions, which allows edge servers to directly interact with the dynamic environment while capturing its dynamic changes in real-time. Through this collaborative endeavour, edge intelligent servers can promptly respond to vehicular requests and return results. We transform the dynamic edge computing problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), and then solve it with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm. Simulation experiments demonstrate the adaptability of our proposed approach in the dynamic environment while successfully enhancing the Quality of Service, that is, decreasing total delay and energy consumption.",

We solve this by developing a CSS-specific LLR extractor. Second, we improve LDPC decoding efficiency by using symbol-level information to fine-tune LLRs of error-prone bits. Finally, to minimize the decoding latency caused by the computationally heavy Soft Belief Propagation (SBP) algorithm typically used in LDPC decoding, we apply graph neural networks to accelerate the process. Our results show that LLDPC extends default LoRa’s lifetime by 86.7% and reduces SBP algorithm decoding latency by 58.09×.",

Subtly combining the self-supervised feature mapping module and the DRL-based decision-making module, the proposed PATO addresses both privacy protection and task offloading challenges. Furthermore, PATO is designed as a general solution for task offloading problems and exhibits good transfer ability.",

    "abstract": "For mobile robotic networks in industrial scenarios, reliable and energy-efficient communications are crucial yet challenging. Fortunately, collaborative beamforming (CB) emerges as a promising solution, which can increase the transmission gain and reduce the transmit power of robots by constructing a mobile robot-enabled virtual antenna array (MRVAA). The performance of CB is tightly related to robot positions, necessitating proper robot selection. However, robot selection may expose the network to the risk of unbalanced energy distribution, reducing network lifetime. Additionally, the mobility and variable numbers of robots require flexible and scalable robot selection algorithms. To tackle these challenges, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to reduce the maximum sidelobe level (MSLL) of MRVAA while minimizing the standard deviation of the network energy distribution (SDNED) by selecting robots for CB. Then, based on distributed multi-agent learning (MARL), we propose an effective and scalable robot selection algorithm with energy considered (RoSE) to solve the problem, where difference-rewards function (DRF) and policy sharing are designed for enhancing convergence rate and policy stability. Simulation results show that the RoSE has the scalability to positions and numbers of robots. Furthermore, RoSE surpasses existing selection algorithms in network lifetime and time efficiency, while still maintaining comparable MSLL.",

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one of the most popular wireless protocols to implement IoT applications because of its energy efficiency and low-cost properties. However, the development of BLE applications is time-consuming and exhausting. Users are required to write programs for both sides of a BLE connection using complicated low-level APIs. Moreover, it needs much expertise for developers to set appropriate parameters in accordance to different application requirements, especially when there exist multiple concurrent BLE connections. To address these problems, we propose BLEdge , an edge-centric programming approach for BLE applications with multi-connection optimization. First, we propose a wireless bus abstraction for BLE programming. With this, users can write BLE applications in an edge-centric way, as if the BLE-connected peripherals are physically attached to the edge node. Second, we advocate an optimization approach for BLE connection parameters. This optimization approach considers the time slot collision problem under multi-connection scenario. We conduct extensive experiments with nRF52840DK platform. Experiment results show that BLEdge can reduce 62.50% to 90.55% LOC (Lines of Code) when developing BLE applications.

Furthermore, to tackle the joint optimization problem of content caching and bandwidth allocation, we propose I-MADDPG, an improved multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. It determines the next continuous action based on the reward value at the current moment and the average reward value in the iteration period as reference parameters.

Under Markovian assumptions on the sleeping schedules and the channel conditions, we obtain the expected energy consumption of transmitting a packet on any path to the gateway. We also provide an upper (Chernoff) bound and a tight large deviations asymptotic for the latency probability on each path. To capture the trade-off between energy consumption and latency probability, we formulate the problem of choosing a path to minimize a weighted sum of the expected energy consumption and the exponent of the latency probability. We provide two algorithms to solve this problem: a centralized stochastic global optimization algorithm, and a distributed algorithm based on simulated annealing.

Current CCA implementations cannot determine the device type occupying the media, leaving nodes unable to differentiate between WSN traffic and interference. However, this would be valuable as MAC protocols benefit from reacting differently depending on the channel occupier. In this article, we describe a method called Power Differentiating Clear Channel Assessment (P-DCCA). Transmitters vary the output power of the radio while the packet is being sent. Receivers are able to identify signals with this characteristic, enabling a Differentiating Clear Channel Assessment (DCCA) check to reveal if the medium is currently occupied by WSN traffic or other interference. We present an implementation and thorough evaluation of Power P-DCCA. Using ContikiMAC as an example, we describe how P-DCCA can be integrated within MAC protocols. We show via large-scale testbed experiments and deployments that P-DCCA enabled networks have a significant improved performance. For example, we show that a P-DCCA enabled network can improve Packet Reception Rate (PRR) by up to a factor of 10 while reducing energy usage by more than 80% under heavy interference.",

However, sensor networks are now envisioned for applications that require higher-end devices, such as smart cameras, smart phones, and laptops. The power dissipated by such devices is much larger than low-end sensors and can create thermal emergencies in sensor hardware even in calm environments. In this article, we present unique management opportunities for distributed estimation tasks in sensor networks consisting of high-end devices prone to thermal issues. We attempt to balance both thermal- and performance-related constraints by examining trade-offs between sensor sampling rate, number of sensors, node temperature, and state estimation error. Initially, we devise a scheduling algorithm which can achieve a desired real-time performance constraint while maintaining a thermal limit on temperature assuming identical nodes in the network. Then, we extend the concept to a network consisting of heterogeneous sensor nodes. Analytical results and simulation experiments are done for state estimation with a Kalman filter for simplicity, but our main contributions should easily extend to any form of estimation with measurable error. Results show that our policies can successfully balance the trade-offs between thermal- and performance-related constraints. Note that our analyses, schemes, and results are less applicable to low-end sensors whose operation does not cause high node temperature. This work is most suited for high-performance sensors and upper-tier sensors which experience greater workloads.",

    "abstract": "Positioning disk-shaped sensors to optimize certain coverage parameters is a fundamental problem in ad hoc sensor networks. The hexagon lattice arrangement is known to be optimally efficient in the plane, even though 20.9% of the area is unnecessarily covered twice, however, the arrangement is very rigid—any movement of a sensor from its designated grid position (due to, e.g., placement error or obstacle avoidance) leaves some region uncovered, as would the failure of any one sensor. In this article, we consider how to arrange sensors in order to guarantee multiple coverage, that is, k -coverage for some value k &gt; 1. A naive approach is to superimpose multiple hexagon lattices, but for robustness reasons, we may wish to space sensors evenly apart. We present two arrangement methods for k -coverage: (1) optimizing a Riesz energy function in order to evenly distribute nodes, and (2) simply shrinking the hexagon lattice and making it denser. The first method often approximates the second, and so we focus on the latter. We show that a density increase tantamount to k copies of the lattice can yield k ′-coverage, for k ′ &gt; k (e.g., k = 11, k ′ = 12 and k = 21, k ′ = 24), by exploiting the double-coverage regions. Our examples' savings provably converge in the limit to the ≈ 20.9% maximum. We also provide analogous results for the square lattice and its ≈ 57% inefficiency (e.g., k = 3, k ′ = 4 and k =5, k ′ = 7) and show that for multi-coverage for some values of k ′, the square lattice can actually be more efficient than the hexagon lattice. We also explore other benefits of shrinking the lattice: Doing so allows all sensors to move about their intended positions independently while nonetheless guaranteeing full coverage and can also allow us to tolerate probabilistic sensor failure when providing 1-coverage or k -coverage. We conclude by construing the shrinking factor as a budget to be divided among these three benefits.",

    "abstract": "Coverage is one of the fundamental concepts in the design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the sense that the monitoring quality of a phenomenon depends on the quality of service provided by the sensors in terms of how well a field of interest is covered. It enables the sensors to detect any event that may occur in the field, thus, meeting the application-specific requirements. Several applications require k - coverage , where each point in the field is covered by at least k sensors, which helps increase data availability to ensure better data reliability. Achieving k -coverage of a field of interest becomes a more challenging issue in sparsely deployed WSNs. Though the problem of coverage in WSNs has been well studied in the literature, only little research efforts have been devoted to the case of sparsely deployed WSNs. Thus, in this article, we investigate the problem of k -coverage in sparse WSNs using static and mobile sensors, which do not necessarily have the same communication range, sensing range, and energy supply. Precisely, we propose an optimized, generalized framework for k -coverage in sparsely deployed WSNs, called k -SCHEMES, which exploits sensor heterogeneity and mobility. First, we characterize k -coverage using heterogeneous sensors based on Helly 's Theorem. Second, we introduce our energy-efficient four-tier architecture to achieve mobile k -coverage of a region of interest in a field. Third, on top of this architecture, we suggest two data-gathering protocols, called direct data-gathering and forwarding chain-based data-gathering, using the concept of mobile proxy sink. We found that the second data-gathering protocol outperforms the first one. For energy-efficient forwarding, we compute the minimum transmission distance between any pair of consecutive mobile proxy sinks forming the forwarding chain as well as the corresponding optimum number of mobile proxy sinks in this chain. We corroborate our analysis with several simulation results.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and evaluating the performance of large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a challenging problem. The traditional method for representing the global state of a system as a cross product of the states of individual nodes in the system results in a state space whose size is exponential in the number of nodes. We propose an alternative way of representing the global state of a system: namely, as a probability mass function (pmf) which represents the fraction of nodes in different states. A pmf corresponds to a point in a Euclidean space of possible pmf values, and the evolution of the state of a system is represented by trajectories in this Euclidean space. We propose a novel performance evaluation method that examines all pmf trajectories in a dense Euclidean space by exploring only finite relevant portions of the space. We call our method Euclidean model checking . Euclidean model checking is useful both in the design phase—where it can help determine system parameters based on a specification—and in the evaluation phase—where it can help verify performance properties of a system. We illustrate the utility of Euclidean model checking by using it to design a time difference of arrival (TDoA) distance measurement protocol and to evaluate the protocol's implementation on a 90-node WSN. To facilitate such performance evaluations, we provide a Markov model estimation method based on applying a standard statistical estimation technique to samples resulting from the execution of a system.",

    "abstract": "We consider a small extent sensor network for event detection, in which nodes periodically take samples and then contend over a random access network to transmit their measurement packets to the fusion center. We consider two procedures at the fusion center for processing the measurements. The Bayesian setting, is assumed, that is, the fusion center has a prior distribution on the change time. In the first procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion center is network--oblivious and makes a decision only when a complete vector of measurements taken at a sampling instant is available. In the second procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion center is network--aware and processes measurements as they arrive, but in a time-causal order. In this case, the decision statistic depends on the network delays, whereas in the network--oblivious case, the decision statistic does not. This yields a Bayesian change-detection problem with a trade-off between the random network delay and the decision delay that is, a higher sampling rate reduces the decision delay but increases the random access delay. Under periodic sampling, in the network--oblivious case, the structure of the optimal stopping rule is the same as that without the network, and the optimal change detection delay decouples into the network delay and the optimal decision delay without the network. In the network--aware case, the optimal stopping problem is analyzed as a partially observable Markov decision process, in which the states of the queues and delays in the network need to be maintained. A sufficient decision statistic is the network state and the posterior probability of change having occurred, given the measurements received and the state of the network. The optimal regimes are studied using simulation.",

Examples of DTNs include interplanetary networks, battlefield networks, smart highways, remote sensing, and animal-movement outposts. There exist a number of mobility models describing the operation of various DTNs. One common characteristic that all mobility models share is the distribution of contact time and inter-contact time between nodes. Predicting an end-to-end delay in networks with disruptive links is more complicated than predicting the delay in connected networks. Disruptive patterns and underlying routing algorithms play a major role in an end-to-end delay modeling. In this article, we introduce a new model that can be used to estimate the end-to-end delay in networks with intermittent links. The model incorporates the two non-deterministic delay distributions, namely link intermittency and tandem queuing delay distributions. The model is based on an open queuing system with exponentially distributed link intermittency. The model gives a close approximation of the average end-to-end delay and the delay variance in closed forms. Simulation results on various networks and under different traffic conditions confirm the accuracy of the model within the conventional bounds of statistical significance.",

However, these cannot be the only component of a net-load balancing framework for smart grids with high PV penetration. These grids sometimes exhibit supply surplus, causing overvoltages. Currently, these are mitigated using voltage manipulation techniques such as Volt-Var Optimizations, which are computationally expensive, thereby increasing the complexity of grid operations. Taking advantage of recent technological developments that enable rapid selective connection of PV modules of an installation to the grid, we develop a unified net-load balancing framework that performs both load and solar curtailment. We show that when the available curtailment values are discrete, this problem is NP-hard and we develop bounded approximation algorithms. Our algorithms produce fast solutions, given the tight timing constraints required for grid operation, while ensuring that practical constraints such as fairness, network capacity limits, and so forth are satisfied. We also develop an online algorithm that performs net-load balancing using only data available for the current interval. Using both theoretical analysis and practical evaluations, we show that our net-load balancing algorithms provide solutions that are close to optimal in a small amount of time.",

In practice, the bikes are often parked in close proximity to buildings, where GPS accuracy suffers, making bike search a challenging task. This article proposes a novel approach to addressing this problem. Inspired by multi-antenna systems, our method tries to collect GPS signals from multiple distributed bikes, by organizing a group of bikes into a network, called a BikeGPS network. Formed by pedestrian users who opportunistically measure inter-bike distance via radio sensing and step tracking, the generated network permits one to map all the nodes’ satellite range measurements into a single lead node ’s view. By considering both signal and geometry properties of satellite raw measurements, and using an asynchronous coarse time navigation algorithm, the lead node can accurately derive the locations of all the network nodes. Experiments in real-world scenarios show that BikeGPS significantly improves the localization performance, in terms of both accuracy and solution availability, compared with the naive GPS approach and a high-level cooperative localization method.",

The interaction between the two nodes is modeled as an asymmetric Bayesian game where the victim has incomplete information about the attacker. We show how to derive the optimal Bayesian strategies for both the defender and the attacker, which may then serve as guidelines to develop and gauge efficient heuristics that are less computationally expensive than the optimal strategies. For example, we propose a neural-network-based learning method that allows the node to effectively defend itself from the jamming with a significantly reduced computational load.

A major challenge of ILM is automatic appliance identification, in which the system is able to determine automatically a label of the active appliance connected to the smart device. Existing ILM techniques depend on labels input by end-users and are usually under the supervised learning scheme. However, in reality, end-users labeling is laboriously rendering insufficient training data to fit the supervised learning models. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) method that leverages rich signals from the unlabeled dataset and jointly learns the classification loss for the labeled dataset and the consistency training loss for unlabeled dataset. The samples fit into consistency learning are generated by a transformation that is built upon weighted versions of DTW Barycenter Averaging algorithm. The work is inspired by two recent advanced works in SSL in computer vision and combines the advantages of the two. We evaluate our method on the dataset collected from our developed Internet-of-Things based energy monitoring system in a smart home environment. We also examine the method’s performances on 10 benchmark datasets. As a result, the proposed method outperforms other methods on our smart appliance datasets and most of the benchmarks datasets, while it shows competitive results on the rest datasets.",

However, the limited power supply and the restricted computation capability make it challenging to conduct seamless sensing and continuous inference tasks on resource-constrained devices. How to conduct energy-efficient sensing and perform rich-sensor inference tasks on IoT devices is crucial for the success of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose a novel energy-efficient collaborative sensing framework to optimize the energy consumption of IoT devices. Specifically, we explore the latent correlations among heterogeneous sensors via an attention mechanism in temporal convolutional network to quantify the dependency among sensors, and characterize the heterogeneous sensors in terms of energy consumption to categorize them into low-power sensors and energy-intensive sensors . Finally, to decrease the sampling frequency of energy-intensive sensors , we propose a multi-task learning strategy to predict the statuses of energy-intensive sensors based on the low-power sensors . To evaluate the performance of the proposed collaborative sensing framework, we develop a mobile application to collect concurrent heterogeneous data streams from all sensors embedded in Huawei Mate 8. The experimental results show that latent correlation learning is greatly helpful to understand the latent correlations among heterogeneous streams, and it is feasible to predict the statuses of energy-intensive sensors by low-power sensors with high accuracy and fast convergence. In terms of energy consumption, the proposed collaborative sensing framework is able to preserve the energy consumption of IoT devices by nearly 50% for continuous data acquisition tasks.",

Although LPWMNs work satisfactorily most of the time thanks to decades of research, they are often complex, inelastic to change, and difficult to manage once the networks are deployed. Moreover, the deliveries of control commands, especially those carrying urgent information such as emergency alarms, suffer long delay, since the messages must go through the hop-by-hop transport. Recent studies show that adding low-power wide-area network radios such as LoRa onto the LPWMN devices (e.g., ZigBee) effectively overcomes the limitation. However, users have shown a marked reluctance to embrace the new heterogeneous communication approach because of the cost of hardware modification. In this article, we introduce LoRaBee, a novel LoRa to ZigBee cross-technology communication (CTC) approach, which leverages the energy emission in the Sub-1 GHz bands as the carrier to deliver information. Although LoRa and ZigBee adopt distinct modulation techniques, LoRaBee sends information from LoRa to ZigBee by putting specific bytes in the payload of legitimate LoRa packets. The bytes are selected such that the corresponding LoRa chirps can be recognized by the ZigBee devices through sampling the received signal strength. Experimental results show that our LoRaBee provides reliable CTC communication from LoRa to ZigBee with the throughput of up to 281.61 bps in the Sub-1 GHz bands.",

There are many possible ways to implement BEKPSs, and we propose a framework for describing and analysing them. In their paper “From Key Predistribution to Key Redistribution,” Cichoń et al. [2010] propose a scheme for “redistributing” keys to a wireless sensor network using a broadcast channel after an initial key predistribution. We classify this as a BEKPS and analyse it in that context. We provide simpler proofs of some results from their paper, give a precise analysis of the resilience of their scheme, and discuss possible modifications. We then study two scenarios where BEKPSs may be particularly desirable and propose a suitable family of BEKPSs for each case.

Such correct behavior is typically expressed by global invariants over the state of different sensors or actuators. Nevertheless, to leverage the computing capabilities of WSN nodes, the application intelligence needs to reside inside the network. The task of ensuring that the monitored processes behave safely thus becomes inherently distributed, and hence more complex. In this article we present DICE, a system enabling WSN-based distributed monitoring of global invariants. A DICE invariant is expressed by predicates defined over the state of multiple WSN nodes, such as the expected state of actuators based on given sensed environmental conditions. Our modular design allows two alternative protocols for detecting invariant violations: both perform in-network aggregation but with different degrees of decentralization, therefore supporting scenarios with different network and data dynamics. We characterize and compare the two protocols using large-scale simulations and a real-world testbed. Our results indicate that invariant violations are detected in a timely and energy-efficient manner.

The system is scalable because it requires a very small communication bandwidth and only light-weight processing on a “fusion center” which produces final tracking results. The fusion center can thus be cheap and can be duplicated to increase reliability. In the proposed decentralized system all low level video processing is performed on smart cameras. The smart cameras transmit a compact high-level description of moving people to the fusion center, which fuses this data using a Bayesian approach. A second contribution in our system is that the camera-based processing takes feedback from the fusion center about the most recent locations and motion states of tracked people into account. Based on this feedback and background subtraction results, the smart cameras generate a best hypothesis for each person. We evaluate the performance (in terms of precision and accuracy) of the tracker in indoor and meeting scenarios where individuals are often occluded by other people and/or furniture. Experimental results are presented based on the tracking of up to 4 people in a meeting room of 9 m by 5 m using 6 cameras. In about two hours of data, our method has only 0.3 losses per minute and can typically measure the position with an accuracy of 21 cm. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods and show that our system performs at least as good as other methods. However, our system is capable to run in real-time and therefore produces instantaneous results.",

    "abstract": "Node mobility is a key feature of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in many sensory applications, such as healthcare. The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol should properly support the mobility in the network. In particular, mobility is complicated for contention-free protocols like Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). An efficient access to the shared medium is scheduled based on the node's local neighborhood. This neighborhood may vary over time due to node movement or other dynamics. In scenarios including body-area networking, for instance, some clusters of nodes move together, creating further challenges but also opportunities. This article presents a MAC protocol, MCMAC, that provides efficient support for cluster mobility in TDMA-based MAC protocols in WSNs. The proposed protocol exploits a hybrid contention-free and contention-based communication approach to support cluster mobility. This relieves the protocol from rescheduling demand due to frequent node movements. Moreover, we propose a listening scheduling mechanism to avoid idle listening to mobile nodes that leads to a considerable energy saving for sensor nodes. The protocol is validated by performing several experiments in a real-world large-scale deployment including several mobile clusters. The protocol is also evaluated by extensive simulation of networks with various scales and configurations.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for dynamic composition of communication services that is well suited for facilitating research and prototyping on real experimental infrastructures of remotely configurable embedded devices. By using the concept of composability, our framework supports modular component development for various networking functions, thereby promoting code reuse. The framework consists of four components: the physical testbed, the module library, the declarative language, and the workbench. Its reference implementation, ProtoStack, developed using semantic web technologies, supports remote experimentation on sensor platform-based infrastructure and is thus well suited also for experimenters who do not possess their own physical experimentation infrastructure. We illustrate how ProtoStack supports research in service-oriented networks and cognitive networking. The cost of increased flexibility and prototyping speed of the protocol stack is paid in terms of increased memory footprint, processing speed, and energy consumption. Compared to the most related noncomposable approach, the CRime library used by ProtoStack has a 16--17% larger footprint, takes 2.4 times longer to execute an open-send-recv-close sequence, and consumes 1.6% more power in doing so. Even though with ProtoStack more resources are consumed by the node, the tradeoff in terms of prototyping speed pays off.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the joint application of compressive sensing (CS) and network coding (NC) to the problem of energy-efficient data gathering in wireless sensor networks. We consider the problem of optimally constructing forwarding trees to carry compressed data to projection nodes. Each compressed dataset refers to a weighted aggregation (or sum) of sensed measurements from network sensors collected at one projection node. Projection nodes then forward their received compressed data to the sink, which subsequently recovers the original measurements. This aggregation technique, based on CS, is shown to reduce significantly the number of transmissions in the network. We observe that the presence of multiple forwarding trees gives rise to many-to-many communication patterns in sensor networks that, in turn, can be exploited to perform NC on the compressed data being forwarded on these trees. Such a technique will further reduce the number of transmissions required to gather the measurements, resulting in a better network-wide energy efficiency. This article addresses the problem of NC--aware construction of forwarding/aggregation trees. We present a mathematical model to optimally construct such forwarding trees, which encourage NC operations on the compressed data. Owing to its complexity, we further develop algorithmic methods (both centralized and distributed) for solving the problem and analyze their complexities. We show that our algorithmic methods are scalable and accurate, with worst-case optimality gap not exceeding 3.96% in the studied scenarios. We also show that, when bothNC and compressive data gathering are considered jointly, performance gains (reduction in number of transmissions) of up to 30% may be attained. Finally, we show that the proposed methods distribute the workload of data gathering throughout the network nodes uniformly, resulting in extended network life times.",

    "abstract": "Two-tiered wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs) have been proposed to enhance network capabilities, where a set of resource-rich mobile nodes (termed actors ) form a connected backbone to relay sensing data from static sensors to the sink and sometimes are requested by sensors to perform a particular action. Such a two-tiered WSAN facilitates scalability and can efficiently reduce the energy consumption incurred by conventional hop-by-hop relaying via only sensors. However, relocating actors to achieve both connectivity and load balance is a challenge, especially when there is no location information of the nodes. Connectivity ensures that the actors are connected, whereas load balance ensures that actors collect and originate a similar amount of sensory data from the sensors. In this article, we formulate the Connected and Balanced Mobile Actor Relocation (CBMAR) optimization problem to address both connectivity and load balance and prove that the problem is NP-hard. We thus propose a dual-mode distributed actor relocation protocol that does not rely on any location information of nodes to relocate actors. The idea is to locally form virtual Voronoi cells of actors (termed covering cells ) based on the lower-tiered topology, where each actor locally recruits its own sensor members to form its own covering cell. By maintaining the covering cell, each actor locally relocates itself toward a sensor along the lower-tiered topology. Extensive simulation results show that the protocol can achieve both objectives of connectivity and load balance with low moving and communication overheads.",

Emotional biases could lead to incorrect segmentation of patient-authorized texts, and labeling emotional data is time-consuming.

    "abstract": "Charging processes are the key to promoting electric taxis and improving their operational efficiency due to frequent charging activities and long charging time. Nevertheless, optimizing charging resource allocation in real time is extremely challenging because of uneven charging demand/supply distributions, heuristic-based charging behaviors of drivers, and city-scale of the fleets. The existing solutions have utilized real-time contextual information for charging recommendation, but they do not consider the much-richer fleet information, leading to the suboptimal individual-based charging recommendation. In this paper, we design a data-driven fleet-oriented charging recommendation system for charging resource allocation called ForETaxi for electric taxis , which aims to minimize the overall charging overhead for the entire fleet, instead of individual vehicles. ForETaxi considers not only current charging requests but also possible charging requests of other nearby electric taxis in the near future by inferring their status in real time. More importantly, we implement ForETaxi with multiple types of sensor data from the Chinese Shenzhen city including GPS data, and taxi transaction data from more than 13,000 electric taxis, combined with road network data and charging station data. The data-driven evaluation results show that compared to the state-of-the-art individual-based recommendation methods, our fleet-oriented ForETaxi outperforms them by 16% in the total charging time reduction and 82% in the queuing time reduction.",

The current IoV, however, faces three main issues: (1) existing frameworks fail to build a complete data management system, (2) received messages in an untrusted environment are challenging to assess for credibility, and (3) the centralized ways to store data are causing severe security and efficiency problems. Blockchain-enabled IoV (BIoV) provides an opportunity for addressing these issues. This paper proposes a trusted paradigm of data management based on a vehicle–road–cloud architecture. A few-shot learning model, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) sampling is designed to evaluate whether the uploading message is malicious. This paper also proposes the novel group-weighted-decay Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm, an improved version of PBFT to store data, and provides a comprehensive review of its viability and data management procedures. By employing the joint gwd-PBFT and Proof of Trust (PoT) consensus, the method mitigates the issue of excessive incentives.

However, the uncertainty of wireless channel state and data volume of offloading tasks, as well as the data security privacy of offloading tasks, bring serious challenges to computation offloading in MEC. In this article, we consider a time-varying MEC scenario and formalize the delay and energy consumption during the computation offloading process as a joint optimization problem.

Different from traditional methods, we improve the federated learning (FL) algorithm and propose a thoughtful cloud-edge-client FL task prediction mechanism based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory. Each participating MD trains the model locally without uploading data to the server, and periodically aggregates the model in the edge and in the cloud. The algorithm both eliminates the need to solve complex optimization problems and ensures user privacy security.

To achieve high efficiency, WPT and sensors both adopt directional antennas. Most previous works about directional charging optimize overall charging efficiency, but neglect energy scheduling on nodes for optimizing tasks. This disadvantage may cause a serious imbalance between the energy supply and task loads. This article takes both aspects into consideration. To achieve an overall performance improvement, we jointly schedule rotatable chargers and allocate tasks to nodes in a WSN powered by directional chargers. As far as we know, this is the first work to propose the Task-oriented Energy Scheduling (TOES) problem, i.e., given a set of rotatable directional chargers and some wireless rechargeable sensor nodes, scheduling chargers and nodes to maximize the total utility gained from a set of tasks. We prove the NP-Hardness of TOES. Then we design a 4-approximation algorithm for TOES by jointly solving two subproblems of the original one. We further extend this problem to the windowed task model and propose a \\(\\frac{4}{1-\\gamma }\\) approximation algorithm for it, where γ is the proportion of the rotating period.

In this paper, we propose a novel attack to mitigate query-based fingerprinting methods based on data augmentation methods. We propose a randomized transformation on input samples to significantly mislead the fingerprint samples’ prediction and compromise the IP verification. Then, our attack can keep the model utility with an acceptable accuracy drop in the data-free scenario (i.e. without any samples) or achieve much higher precision in the data-limited scenario (i.e. with a small number of samples with the same distribution). An intensive evaluation of three well-known model structures and three well-known datasets shows that our attack can effectively mitigate five query-based DNN fingerprinting methods in top-tier conferences.",

Taking a semi-supervised cross-modal learning framework with a hybrid loss function as the core, AutoDLAR transfers rich visual information to automatically label WiFi signals for WiFi-based HAR. Specifically, we devise a lightweight and multi-view WiFi sensing model with a parallel feature embedding method to accurately identify activities and accelerate recognition speed. Then, we exploit the video data to fine-tune a well-established visual HAR model, generating effective pseudo-labels for guiding the WiFi model’s training. We also build a synchronized Video-WiFi dataset with seven types of human activities under different scenarios to enable training and validating the semi-supervised HAR system. Extensive experiments on our collected activity dataset and the emotion recognition benchmark demonstrate that AutoDLAR attains an average accuracy of over 95.89% without manual labeling and only spends the inference time of 3.35 ms, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

In smart farm applications, how to quickly locate and search some specified items (e.g., animals) is a critical problem, for which tag searching can be used to solve the problem. While there are some works on tag searching, they are designed for static objects and cannot meet the time efficiency requirements where the searched animals’ movement brings challenges. In this paper, we propose SHIR, an efficient tag-searching protocol based on historical information reasoning, which can be applied in scenarios containing mobile tags that cannot be well handles in existing tag search protocols. By continuously counting the difference between the predicted reply signal and the actual signal received from tags for multiple rounds, SHIR avoids the waste of time slots and achieves high time efficiency. Furthermore, it can infer unverified tag status through historical information to speed up the search process. We further propose the Enhanced SHIR (ESHIR) protocol by filtering out the interference tags in the query area to avoid wasting time verifying interference tags. Compared with previous probabilistic approaches, SHIR gets accurate search results with no false positives. Extensive experimental results show that our best protocol can improve the time efficiency by up to 42% compared with the the-state-of-art solution.",

To address this gap, this article proposes to automatically establish relationships between IoT devices and their vulnerabilities in the wild. Specifically, we construct a deep neural network (DNN) to extract semantic information from IoT packets and generate fine-grained fingerprints of IoT devices. This enables us to annotate IoT devices in cyberspace, including their device type, vendor, and product information. We collect vulnerability reports from various security sources and extract IoT device information from these reports to automatically match vulnerabilities with the fingerprints of IoT devices. We implemented a prototype system and conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that our DNN model achieved a 98% precision rate and a 95% recall rate in IoT device fingerprinting. Furthermore, we collected and analyzed over 13,063 IoT-related vulnerability reports and our method automatically built 5,458 connections between IoT device fingerprints and their vulnerabilities. These findings shed light on the ongoing threat of cyber-attacks on IoT systems as both IoT devices and disclosed vulnerabilities are targets for malicious attackers.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the design and implementation of a novel intrusion detection system, called EchoSensor, which leverages speakers and microphones in smart home devices to capture human gait patterns for individual identification. EchoSensor harnesses the speaker to send inaudible acoustic signals (around 20 kHz) and utilizes the microphone to capture the reflected signals. As the reflected signals have unique variations in the Doppler shift respective to the gaits of different people, EchoSensor is able to profile human gait patterns from the generated spectrograms. To mine the gait information, we first propose a two-stage interference cancellation scheme to remove the background noise and environmental interference, followed by a new method to detect the starting point of walking and estimate the gait cycle time. We then perform the fine-grained analysis of the spectrograms to extract a series of features. In the end, machine learning is employed to construct an identifier for individual recognition. We implement the EchoSensor system and deploy it under different household environments to conduct intrusion detection tasks. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that EchoSensor can achieve the averaged Intruder Gait Detection Rate (IDR) and True Family Member Gait Detection Rate (TFR) of 92.7% and 91.9%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Among numerous indoor localization systems, WiFi fingerprint-based localization has been one of the most attractive solutions, which is known to be free of extra infrastructure and specialized hardware. To push forward this approach for wide deployment, three crucial goals on high deployment ubiquity, high localization accuracy, and low maintenance cost are desirable. However, due to severe challenges about signal variation, device heterogeneity, and database degradation root in environmental dynamics, pioneer works usually make a trade-off among them. In this paper, we propose iToLoc, a deep learning based localization system that achieves all three goals simultaneously. Once trained, iToLoc will provide accurate localization service for everyone using different devices and under diverse network conditions, and automatically update itself to maintain reliable performance anytime. iToLoc is purely based on WiFi fingerprints without relying on specific infrastructures. The core components of iToLoc are a domain adversarial neural network and a co-training based semi-supervised learning framework. Extensive experiments across 7 months with 8 different devices demonstrate that iToLoc achieves remarkable performance with an accuracy of 1.92m and &gt; 95% localization success rate. Even 7 months after the original fingerprint database was established, the rate still maintains &gt; 90%, which significantly outperforms previous works.",

    "abstract": "Local differential privacy (LDP) is a promising privacy model for distributed data collection. It has been widely deployed in real-world systems (e.g. Chrome, iOS, macOS). In LDP-based mechanisms, an aggregator collects private values perturbed by each user and then analyses these values to estimate their statistics, such as frequency and mean. Most existing works focus on simple scalar value types, such as boolean and categorical values. However, with the emergence of smart sensors and Internet of Things, high-dimensional data are gaining increasing popularity. In many cases where more than one type of sensor data are collected simultaneously, correlations exist between various attributes of such data, e.g. temperature and luminance. To ensure LDP for high-dimensional data, existing solutions either partition the privacy budget ϵ among these correlated attributes or adopt sampling, both of which dilute the density of useful information and thus result in poor data utility. In this paper, we propose a relaxed LDP model, namely, univariate dominance local differential privacy (UDLDP), for high-dimensional data. We quantify the correlations between attributes and present a correlation-bounded perturbation (CBP) mechanism that optimizes the partitioning of privacy budget on each correlated attribute. Furthermore, we extend CBP to support sampling, which is a common bandwidth reduction technique in sensor networks and Internet of Things. We derive the best allocation strategy of sampling probabilities among attributes in terms of data utility, which leads to the correlation-bounded perturbation mechanism with sampling (CBPS). Finally, we discuss how to collect and leverage the correlation from real-time data stream with a by-round algorithm to enhance the utility. The performance of the proposed mechanisms is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art LDP mechanisms on real-world and synthetic datasets.",

However, they do not optimize the balance between throughput and spectrum occupancy, both of which serve as pivotal parameters in concurrent transmissions. Moreover, these works also introduce complex components on tag thereby increasing both power consumption and deployment costs. In this article, we propose Spray , a tag-lightweight system to achieve high throughput and narrow-band occupancy with low power. The key idea is to incorporate an agile channel allocating and scheduling mechanism into the backscatter network. This approach allows for efficient spectrum utilization and concurrency without the need for energy-intensive components. To optimize throughput in the presence of the challenge of harmonic interference, we introduce a novel algorithm that determines the channels with an optimal combination of central frequencies and bandwidths. Additionally, we propose a fair scheduling strategy to ensure equitable transmission opportunities for all tags. We prototype the Spray tag using commercial off-the-shelf components and implement the excitation and receiver with software-defined radio platform. Our evaluation shows that the system supports 30 parallel tags transmitting in the bandwidth of 600 kHz and the throughput can reach more than 280 kbps.",

For 1D systems we use representations of sensor sequences on graphs to derive limits on the number of object locations that can be monitored by a given sensor population and sequence length. For 2D systems we show that in certain circumstances the ratio of the number of unique sensor sequences to the number of unique object paths is exponential in the sequence length and we argue that the probability of unique identification is high for sufficiently large sequences.

The MLDA problem is concerned with maximizing the system lifetime T so that we can perform T rounds of data gathering with in-network aggregation, given the initial available energy of the sensors. The M 2 EDA problem is concerned with minimizing the maximum energy consumed by any one sensor when performing T rounds of data gathering with in-network aggregation, for a given T . We provide an effective algorithm for finding an everywhere sparse integral solution to the M 2 EDA problem which is within a factor of α = 1+ 4 n / T of the optimum, where n is the number of nodes. A solution is everywhere sparse if the number of communication links for any subset X of nodes is O ( X ), in our case at most 4| X |. Since often T = ω( n ), we obtain the first everywhere sparse, asymptotically optimal integral solutions to the M 2 EDA problem. Everywhere sparse solutions are desirable since then almost all sensors have small number of incident communication links and small overhead for maintaining state. We also show that the MLDA and M 2 EDA problems are essentially equivalent, in the sense that we can obtain an optimal fractional solution to an instance of the MLDA problem by scaling an optimal fractional solution to a suitable instance of the M 2 EDA problem. As a result, our algorithm is effective at finding everywhere sparse, asymptotically optimal, integral solutions to the MLDA problem, when the initial available energy of the sensors is sufficient for supporting optimal system lifetime which is ω( n ).",

Consequently, redundant sensor nodes that are not currently needed in the covering task can be powered off to conserve energy. These sensors can take over the covering task later to prolong network lifetime. The coverage problem, concerns picking up a set of working sensors that collectively meet the coverage requirements. The problem is complicated by the possibility that targets may have different coverage requirements while sensor nodes may have different amounts of energy. This article proposes a game-theoretic approach to the coverage problem, where each sensor autonomously decides its state with a simple rule based on local information. We give rigorous proofs to show stability, correctness, and efficiency of the proposed game. Implementation variants of the game consider specific issues, such as game convergence time and different amounts of sensor energy.

For the k -coverage contour evaluation problem, a nonuniform-grid-based approach is proposed. We prove that the computation cost of our approach is at most the square root of existing solutions. Based on our k -coverage contour evaluation scheme, a greedy k -coverage rate deployment scheme ( k -CRD) is proposed, which is shown to be an order faster than existing studies for k -coverage rate deployment. The k -CRD can incorporate two different heuristics to further reduce its running time.

    "abstract": "As a typical cyber-physical system (CPS), smart water distribution networks require monitoring of underground water pipes with high sample rates for precise data analysis and water network control. Due to poor underground wireless channel quality and long-range communication requirements, high transmission power is typically adopted to communicate high-speed sensor data streams, posing challenges for long-term sustainable monitoring. In this article, we develop the first sustainable water sensing system, exploiting energy harvesting opportunities from water flows. Our system does this by scheduling the transmission of a subset of the data streams, whereas other correlated streams are estimated using autoregressive models based on the sound-velocity propagation of pressure signals inside water networks. To compute the optimal scheduling policy, we formalize a stochastic optimization problem to maximize the estimation reliability while ensuring the system’s sustainable operation under dynamic conditions. We develop data transmission scheduling (DTS), an asymptotically optimal scheme, and FAST-DTS, a lightweight online algorithm that can adapt to arbitrary energy and correlation dynamics. Using more than 170 days of real data from our smart water system deployment and conducting in vitro experiments to our small-scale testbed, our evaluation demonstrates that Fast-DTS significantly outperforms three alternatives, considering data reliability, energy utilization, and sustainable operation.",

Intelligent self-adaptation data behavior control is then proposed, of which the main idea is to make sensor nodes (SNs) process data intelligently. In the proposed data behavior control, the temporal compression behavior is achieved through variable-cycle transmission and the multivariate spatial compression behavior is motivated by compressed sensing (CS) theory. The multivariate spatial-temporal compression composed of the above two compression behaviors can adjust itself through data comment behaviors including the large-cycle error self-correction behavior based on the node credibility and the large-cycle event self-adaptation behavior based on the information granularity. The data behavior control presented has been validated by the experiments in the Shanghai metro tunnel.

    "abstract": "F lux is a platform for dynamically reconfigurable crowd-sensing using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, programmed under a notion of region-based sensing. Each region is defined by a set of physical constraints that determine the sensing scope, e.g., based on device position or other environmental variables, plus a set of periodic tasks that perform the actual sensing. The resulting behavior is inherently dynamic: as a device’s state changes, e.g., moves in space, it enters and/or leaves different regions, thereby changing the set of active tasks; moreover, regions can be added, deleted, and reprogrammed on-the-fly. F lux makes use of a domain-specific language for sensing tasks that is compiled into abstract bytecode, later executed by a low-footprint virtual machine within a device, guaranteeing runtime safety by construction. For region/task dissemination, F lux employs a broker that holds a changeable region configuration plus gateways that mirror the configuration throughout different network access points to which devices connect. Sensing data is streamed by devices to gateways and then back to the broker. Live or archived data streams are in turn fed by the broker to data-processing clients, which interface with the broker using a publish/subscribe API. We conducted two case-study experiments illustrating F lux : a single-region deployment to monitor WiFi signal quality, and a multi-region deployment to monitor noise, temperature, and places-of-interest based on device movement.",

    "abstract": "Smart and connected communities (SCCs) are emerging as a novel paradigm that allows the community residents to be connected with surrounding environments through smart technologies. However, there remain important challenges to fully exploit the potential of SCCs in improving societal well-being and prosperity. In particular, there is a need for designing green communication systems that are also capable of providing high quality of service (QoS) to distribute and collect information to and from SCCs. However, simultaneously satisfying both of these criteria is difficult due to varying demands posed by heterogeneous sensing modalities, lack of dedicated infrastructure in rural/sub-urban areas, and certain sustainability constraints. While low-power short-range technologies often fail to achieve high QoS, using 3G or 4G technologies (LTE, LTE-A, GSM) for SCCs will eventually face spectrum scarcity and cross technology interference. In recent times, Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been proposed as a solution to overcome policy constraints and improve spectrum scarcity by spectrum sharing. In this article, we show that harnessing DSA in the context of SCCs can also achieve notable benefits in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture for designing sustainable SCCs using a small-scale DSA-enabled overlay network that improves end-to-end energy efficiency of the network while guaranteeing QoS. We also propose a dynamic spectrum band selection approach that intelligently matches any message requirement to a suitable band type by exploiting distinct electro-magnetic characteristics of various bands. Since data generated in SCCs are typically valuable only when delivered within a certain hard (or soft ) deadline, we formulate a linear optimization problem for determining the most energy-efficient path that ensures a delivery time within the hard deadline. After proving that such a problem is NP-Hard, we propose an exact pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm to solve it followed by a polynomial time greedy heuristic. Additionally, we formulate a non-linear optimization problem to find the optimal path when the message delivery time is defined as a soft deadline and extend our greedy heuristic to handle soft deadlines. Compared to the homogeneous band access approaches that opportunistically access free channels within a given spectrum band, our extensive simulation study shows that the proposed dynamic multi-band selection approach significantly improves the achievable energy efficiency while meeting various hard and soft deadlines.",

It represents buildings as directed labeled graphs using the RDF data model. Using the SPARQL query language, building-agnostic applications query a Brick graph to discover the set of resources and relationships they require to operate. Latency-sensitive applications, such as user interfaces, demand response, and model-predictive control, require fast queries—conventionally less than 100ms. We benchmark a set of popular open source and commercial SPARQL databases against three real Brick models using seven application queries and find that none of them meet this performance target. This lack of performance can be attributed to design decisions that optimize for queries over large graphs consisting of billions of triples but give poor spatial locality and join performance on the small dense graphs typical of Brick. We present the design and evaluation of HodDB, a RDF/SPARQL database for Brick built over a node-based index structure. HodDB performs Brick queries 3--700× faster than leading SPARQL databases and consistently meets the 100ms threshold, enabling the portability of important latency-sensitive building applications.

In our previous work, a high-speed and flexible real-time wireless communication protocol called RT-WiFi was designed to support a wide range of CPSs, and we presented an implementation with a single access point (AP). To serve the CPS applications with communication nodes geographically distributed over a large area, multicluster RT-WiFi networks with multiple APs need to be deployed. Although effective scheduling algorithms have been designed to schedule tasks in RT-WiFi networks with a single AP, uncoordinated packet transmissions from multicluster RT-WiFi networks may suffer from cochannel interferences that cause performance degradation. The multicluster RT-WiFi network management problem is to resolve the cochannel interference through channel assignment for clusters and through phasing assignment for communication tasks. In this article, we first derive a conjunctive normal form encoding of the problem and design a TScheduler that searches feasible solutions through the SAT solver. A novel LRTree Scheduler is further designed to solve the problem in chain graphs while keeping the number of used channels small and the network management overhead low. A testbed of the multicluster RT-WiFi network is deployed to validate the design of the multicluster RT-WiFi network and evaluate the performance of the proposed scheduling algorithms compared to the contention-based methods in regular WiFi networks. Performance of these scheduling algorithms in large-scale networks is further evaluated through extensive simulations on both static and dynamic multicluster RT-WiFi networks.",

They pack an impressive set of features but suffer from a slowdown of one to two orders of magnitude compared to optimised native code, reducing throughput and increasing power consumption. Compiling bytecode to native code to improve performance has been studied extensively for larger devices, but the restricted resources on sensor nodes mean most modern techniques cannot be applied. Simply replacing bytecode instructions with predefined sequences of native instructions is known to improve performance but produces code several times larger than the optimised C equivalent, limiting the size of programmes that can fit onto a device. This article identifies the major sources of overhead resulting from this basic approach and presents optimisations to remove most of the remaining performance overhead, and over half the size overhead, reducing them to 67% and 77%, respectively. While this increases the size of the VM, the break-even point at which this fixed cost is compensated for by the smaller code it generates, is well within the range of memory available on a sensor device, allowing us to both improve performance and load more code on a device.",

    "abstract": "Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) has been a foundational receiver component in serial communications. Yet this component is known to add significant design complexity to the receiver and to consume significant resources in area and power. In the resource-limited world of constrained IoT nodes, the need of including CDR in the communication link is being re-assessed and new techniques for achieving reliable serial transmission without CDR have been emerging. These new techniques are distinguished by their use of transition edges rather than bit times for coding and detection. This article presents the design, implementation, and testing of a novel CDR-less transmission protocol that achieves significant improvements in data rate, reliability, packet security, and power efficiency with respect to state-of-the-art CDR-less techniques. The new protocol further tolerates significant jitters and clock discrepancies between transmitter and receiver. An FPGA and an ASIC (65 nm technology) implementation of the protocol have shown it to consume around 19μ W of power at a clock rate of 25 MHz, and to have a small footprint with a gate count of approximately 2,098 gates. In particular, the new protocol reduces area by more than 87% and power by more than 78% in comparison with CDR-based serial bit transfer protocols. Furthermore, the new protocol is shown to be versatile in its applications to available communication media, including wired, wireless, infrared, and human-body channels, under a variety of digital modulation schemes.",

    "abstract": "Many IoT applications have the requirements of conducting complex IoT events processing (e.g., speech recognition) that are hardly supported by low-end IoT devices due to limited resources. Most existing approaches enable complex IoT event processing on low-end IoT devices by statically allocating tasks to the edge or the cloud. In this article, we present Queec, a QoE-aware edge computing system for complex IoT event processing under dynamic workloads. With Queec, the complex IoT event processing tasks that are relatively computation-intensive for low-end IoT devices can be transparently offloaded to nearby edge nodes at runtime. We formulate the problem of scheduling multi-user tasks to multiple edge nodes as an optimization problem, which minimizes the overall offloading latency of all tasks while avoiding the overloading problem. We implement Queec on low-end IoT devices, edge nodes, and the cloud. We conduct extensive evaluations, and the results show that Queec reduces 56.98% of the offloading latency on average compared with the state-of-the-art under dynamic workloads, while incurring acceptable overhead.",

    "abstract": "Data centers have become a critical computing infrastructure in the era of cloud computing. Temperature monitoring and forecasting are essential for preventing server shutdowns because of overheating and improving a data center’s energy efficiency. This article presents a novel cyber-physical approach for temperature forecasting in data centers, one that integrates Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, in situ wireless sensing, and real-time data-driven prediction. To ensure forecasting fidelity, we leverage the realistic physical thermodynamic models of CFD to generate transient temperature distribution and calibrate it using sensor feedback. Both simulated temperature distribution and sensor measurements are then used to train a real-time prediction algorithm. As a result, our approach reduces not only the computational complexity of online temperature modeling and prediction, but also the number of deployed sensors, which enables a portable, noninvasive thermal monitoring solution that does not rely on the infrastructure of a monitored data center. We extensively evaluated the proposed system on a rack of 15 servers and a testbed of five racks and 229 servers in a small-scale production data center. Our results show that our system can predict the temperature evolution of servers with highly dynamic workloads at an average error of 0.52○C, within a duration up to 10 minutes. Moreover, our approach can reduce the required number of sensors by 67% while maintaining desirable prediction fidelity.",

    "abstract": "The provision of accurate and reliable localization and tracking information for a target moving inside a binary Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is quite challenging, especially when sensor failures due to hardware and/or software malfunctions or adversary attacks are considered. Most tracking algorithms assume fault-free scenarios and exploit all binary sensor observations, thus their accuracy may degrade when faults are present in the field. Spatiotemporal information available while the target is traversing the sensor field can be used not only for tracking the target, but also for detecting certain types of faults that appear highly correlated both in time and space. Our main contribution is ftTRACK, a target tracking architecture that is resilient to sensor faults and consists of three main components, namely the sensor health-state estimator, a fault-tolerant localization algorithm, and a location smoothing component. The key idea in the ftTRACK architecture lies in the sensor health-state estimator that leverages spatiotemporal information from previous estimation steps to intelligently choose which sensors to employ in the localization and tracking tasks. Simulation results indicate that ftTRACK maintains a high level of tracking accuracy, even when a large number of sensors fail.",

The system features a user interface similar to Google Search that allows users to type text queries on their activities (e.g., “Where did I buy books?”) and receive textual answers based on their GPS signals. iDiary uses novel algorithms for semantic compression and trajectory clustering of massive GPS signals in parallel to compute the critical locations of a user. We encode these problems as follows. The k-segment mean is a k -piecewise linear function that minimizes the regression distance to the signal. The ( k,m )- segment mean has an additional constraint that the projection of the k segments on R d consists of only m ≤ k segments. A coreset for this problem is a smart compression of the input signal that allows computation of a (1+ε)-approximation to its k -segment or ( k,m )-segment mean in O ( n log n ) time for arbitrary constants ε, k , and m . We use coresets to obtain a parallel algorithm that scans the signal in one pass, using space and update time per point that is polynomial in log n . Using an external database, we then map these locations to textual descriptions and activities so that we can apply text mining techniques on the resulting data (e.g., LSA or transportation mode recognition). We provide experimental results for both the system and algorithms and compare them to existing commercial and academic state of the art. This is the first GPS system that enables text-searchable activities from GPS data.",

When using active cameras to capture events distributed throughout a large area, human control becomes impractical and unreliable. This has led to the development of automated approaches for online camera control. We introduce a new automated camera control approach that consists of a stochastic performance metric and a constrained optimization method . The metric quantifies the uncertainty in the state of multiple points on each target. It uses state-space methods with stochastic models of target dynamics and camera measurements. It can account for occlusions, accommodate requirements specific to the algorithms used to process the images, and incorporate other factors that can affect their results. The optimization explores the space of camera configurations over time under constraints associated with the cameras, the predicted target trajectories, and the image processing algorithms. The approach can be applied to conventional surveillance tasks (e.g., tracking or face recognition), as well as tasks employing more complex computer vision methods (e.g., markerless motion capture or 3D reconstruction).",

In this article, the coexistence of BANs is experimentally performed. A relay-assisted cooperative communications scheme is implemented in a real IEEE 802.15.4-based BAN system with a beacon-enabled mode and guaranteed time slot (GTS) scheduling. As far as we know, it is the first experimental work that enables real-time investigation of the effectiveness of cooperative communications in BANs for co-channel radio interference mitigation. First- and second-order statistics, including outage probability, level crossing rate (LCR), and average fade/nonfade duration, are calculated from the measured effective channel gains of the device-to-coordinator links across all superframes. Empirical results demonstrate significant advantages of using two-hop relay-assisted communications over traditional star topology BAN. Advantages include a maximum of a 10dB increase in channel gain threshold at an outage probability of 10%, which corresponds to a guideline for a 10% maximum packet error rate as specified in the IEEE BAN standard; a reduction in the level crossing rate by a factor of 5 at a channel gain threshold of − 100dB; and an average nonfade duration prolonged by a factor of 5 at the same threshold.",

Localizability detection under the traditional Non-Linear Localization (NLL) schema has been well explored, whereas localizability under the emerging Barycentric coordinate-based Linear Localization (BLL) schema has not been well investigated. Non-awareness of the node localizability in BLL may cause theoretically localizable nodes to converge to wrong locations because their locations are impacted by the wrong locations of the unlocalizable nodes through the iterative location propagation. In this article, the deficiency of existing localizability theories and algorithms in BLL is firstly investigated and then a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for BLL node localizability detection are proposed. Based on these two conditions, an efficient Iterative Maximum Flow (IMF) algorithm is designed to identify BLL localizable nodes, and only localizable nodes are selected to enable a Localizability Aware Barycentric Linear Localization (LABLL) algorithm, which can guarantee the locations of the localizable nodes converging correctly. The proposed IMF and LABLL algorithms are validated by both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Behavior is the recent trend in the Internet of Things (IoT), which analyzes the behaviour of individuals using huge amounts of data collected from their activities. The behavioural data collection process from an individual to a data center in the network layer of the IoT is addressed by the Routing Protocol for Low-powered Lossy Networks (RPL) downward routing policy. A hybrid mode of operation in RPL is designed to minimize the limitations of standard modes of operations in the downward routing of RPL. The existing hybrid modes use the common parameters, such as routing table capacity, energy level, and hop-count for making storing mode decisions at each node. However, none of these works have utilized the deciding parameters, such as number of Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) children, rank, and transmission traffic density for this purpose. In this article, we propose two hybrid MOPs for RPL focusing on the aspect of efficient downward communication for the Internet of Behaviors. The first version decides the mode of each node based on the rank and number of DODAG children of the node. In addition, the proposed Mode of Operation (MOP) has the provision to balance the task of a storing node that is currently running on low power and computational resources by a handover mechanism among the ancestors. The second version of the hybrid MOP utilizes the upward and downward transmission traffic probabilities together with 170 rule or 1D cellular automata to decide the operating mode of a node. The analysis on the upper bound on communication shows that both proposed works have communication overhead nearly equal to the storing mode. The experimental results also infer that the proposed adaptive MOP have lower communication overhead compared with standard storing modes and existing schemes ARPL, MERPL, and HIMOPD.",

However, most charging scheduling schemes in rechargeable wireless sensor networks (WSNs) focus on sensing tasks instead of charging utility, which leaves a considerably high performance gap in the optimal result. Moreover, the charging scheduling is usually non-flexible, in which a full or nothing charging policy suffers from relatively low charging coverage as well as low efficiency. In this article, we focus on how to efficiently improve charging utility when introducing charging-oriented sensor placement and flexible scheduling policy. We formulate a general maximization optimization problem under a general routing constraint, which generates great difficulty. We utilize area partition and charging discretization methods to transform into the scope of maximizing a submodular function problem. Thus, a constant approximation algorithm is delivered to construct a near optimal charging tour. We analyze the performance loss from the discretization to guarantee that the output of the proposed algorithm has more than (1-ɛ)(1-1/ e )/4 of the optimal solution, where ɛ is an arbitrarily small positive parameter (0 &lt; ɛ &lt; 1).

Nowadays, the chest X-ray (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT) are a more effective imaging technique for diagnosing lung related problems. Deep learning has been more mature in the field of supervised learning, but other areas of machine learning have just started, especially for the areas of unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Deep learning has very good performance in speech recognition and image recognition. Using deep learning approaches to diagnose COVID-19 can achieve better cures and treatments.

In addition, the performance evaluation adopted the confused matrix to evaluate the results of these models. To sum up, the CBAM can improve the accuracy of all deep learning models to achieve better performance in contrast to that without this architecture.

Efficiently answering a user's questions requires identifying the correct set of nodes that can answer the question and enabling coordination between them. In this article, we propose a query domain abstraction that allows an application to dynamically specify the nodes best suited to answering a particular query. Selecting the ideal set of heterogeneous sensors entails answering two fundamental questions— how are the selected sensors related to one another, and where should the resulting sensor coalition be located. We introduce two abstractions, the proximity function and the reference function , to precisely specify each of these concerns within a query. All nodes in the query domain must satisfy any provided proximity function, a user-defined function that constrains the relative relationship among the group of nodes (e.g., based on a property of the network or physical environment or on logical properties of the nodes). The selected set of nodes must also satisfy any provided reference function, a mechanism to scope the location of the query domain to a specified area of interest (e.g., within a certain distance from a specified reference point). In this article, we model these abstractions and present a set of protocols that accomplish this task with varying degrees of correctness. We evaluate their performance through simulation and highlight the tradeoffs between protocol overhead and correctness.",

In such a scenario, the network essentially acts as a distributed sampling system. However, unlike in the event detection case, the notion of sensing range is largely meaningless for sampling-interpolation applications. As a result, existing techniques to exploit sensing redundancy in event detection settings, which rely on the existence of such sensing range, become unusable. Instead, this article presents a new method to exploit redundancy for the sampling class of applications by selecting a suitable set of sensors to act as sampling points. Through online estimation of process characteristics, sufficiently accurate interpolation can be achieved. We illustrate an algorithm to obtain multiple disjoint sets and demonstrate significant reductions in the number of active sensors for a wide range of synthetic sensor data.",

    "abstract": "Providing field coverage is a key task in many sensor network applications. With unevenly distributed static sensors, quality coverage with acceptable network lifetime is often difficult to achieve. Fortunately, recent advances on embedded and robotic systems make mobile sensors possible, and we suggest that a small set of mobile sensors can be leveraged toward a cost-effective solution for field coverage. There are, however, a series of fundamental questions to be answered in such a hybrid network of static and mobile sensors: (1) Given the expected coverage quality and system lifetime, how many mobile sensors should be deployed? (2) What are the necessary coverage contributions from each type of sensors? (3) What working and moving patterns should the sensors adopt to achieve the desired coverage contributions? In this article, we offer an analytical study on these problems, and the results lead to a practical system design. Specifically, we present an optimal algorithm for calculating the contributions from different types of sensors, which fully exploits the potentials of the mobile sensors and maximizes the network lifetime. We then present a random walk model for the mobile sensors. The model is distributed with very low control overhead. Its parameters can be fine-tuned to match the moving capability of different mobile sensors and the demands from a broad spectrum of applications. A node collaboration scheme is then introduced to further enhance the system performance. We demonstrate through analysis and simulation that, in our mobile assisted design, a small set of mobile sensors can effectively address the uneven distribution of the static sensors and significantly improve the coverage quality.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical routing has often been mentioned as an appealing point-to-point routing technique for wireless sensor networks (sensornets). While there is a volume of analytical and high-level simulation results demonstrating its merits, there has been little work evaluating it in actual sensornet settings. This article bridges the gap between theory and practice. Having analyzed a number of proposed hierarchical routing protocols, we have developed a framework that captures the common characteristics of the protocols and identifies design points at which the protocols differ. We use a sensornet implementation of the framework in TOSSIM and on a 60-node testbed to study various trade-offs that hierarchical routing introduces, as well as to compare the performance of hierarchical routing with the performance of other routing techniques, namely shortest-path routing, compact routing, and beacon vector routing. The results show that hierarchical routing is a compelling routing technique also in practice. In particular, despite only logarithmic routing state, it can offer small routing stretch: an average of ∼ 1.25 and a 99th percentile of 2. It can also be robust, minimizing the maintenance traffic or the latency of reacting to changes in the network. Moreover, the trade-offs offered by hierarchical routing are attractive for many sensornet applications when compared to the other routing techniques. For example, in terms of routing state, hierarchical routing can offer scalability at least an order of magnitude better than compact routing, and at the same time, in terms of routing stretch, its performance is within 10--15% of that of compact routing; in addition, this performance can further be tuned to a particular application. Finally, we also identify a number of practical issues and limitations of which we believe sensornet developers adopting hierarchical routing should be aware.",

    "abstract": "Mobile sensor networks (MSNs) have been widely deployed to provide a ubiquitous solution to real-time monitoring applications such as traffic data collection in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), ocean data collection in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs), and biodata collection in wireless body area networks (WBANs). One major issue for designing MSNs is the energy-validity trade-off, that is, the trade-off between the energy efficiency for mobile sensors (MSs) and the validity of sensing reports. In this article, we propose a novel mechanism, Energy-Efficient Distributedly Controlled Reporting (E 2 DCR), to mitigate the energy consumption for MSs in real-time monitoring applications while keeping the sensing report valid. In this mechanism, we design dynamic sleeping adjustment (DSA) algorithms to adjust an MS's sleeping period using a heuristic method to reduce energy consumption. We provide analytical models to evaluate the performance of E 2 DCR in terms of the power savings and report validity. It has been shown that with E 2 DCR, MSs can report with less energy consumption while satisfying delay constraints for real-time monitoring applications.",

As the PipeProbe capsule traverses the pipelines, it gathers and transmits pressure and angular velocity readings. Through spatiotemporal analysis of these sensor readings, the proposed algorithm locates all turning points in the pipelines and maps their 3D spatial topology.

    "abstract": "The inherent many-to-one flow of traffic in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) produces a skewed distribution of energy consumption rates, leading to the early demise of those sensors that are critical to the ability of surviving nodes to communicate their measurements to the base station. Numerous previous approaches aimed at balancing the consumption of energy in wireless networks are either too complex or do not address problems unique to the flow of traffic in WSNs. In this article, we propose the use of a dynamic programming algorithm (DPA), an operational, low-complexity algorithm, used in conjunction with four different route discovery algorithms. We perform complexity analysis, statistical evaluation of changes in power consumption rates effected, and verify spatial redistribution of energy consumption of sensors in the network. Our results on multihop networks of 100 randomly placed nodes show that, on average, the two best performing variants of DPA yield a reduction of up to 28% and 36% in power consumption rate variance at the cost of raising average power consumption by 15% and 21%, respectively. Computational complexities of DPA variants range from O ( N 3 ) to O ( N 4 ), which is significantly lower than linear search of the solution space of O ( N ! N i ). Analysis by diffusion plots shows that DPA reduces power consumption of sensors that experience the highest power consumption under the shortest path routes.",

Several existing systems achieve this goal by exploiting appliances’ power usage signatures identified in labor-intensive in situ training processes. Recent work shows that autonomous power usage monitoring can be achieved by supplementing a smart meter with distributed sensors that detect the working states of appliances. However, sensors must be carefully installed for each appliance, resulting in a high installation cost. This article presents Supero —the first ad hoc sensor system that can monitor appliance power usage without supervised training. By exploiting multisensor fusion and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, Supero can classify the appliance events of interest and autonomously associate measured power usage with the respective appliances. Our extensive evaluation in five real homes shows that Supero can estimate the energy consumption with errors less than 7.5%. Moreover, nonprofessional users can quickly deploy Supero with considerable flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Due to the portability of smart phones, more and more people tend to take photos with smart phones. However, energy-saving continues to be a thorny problem, since photographing is a rather power hungry function. To extend the battery life of phones while taking photos, we propose a context-aware energy-saving scheme called “SenSave.” SenSave senses the user’s activities during photographing and adopts suitable energy-saving strategies accordingly. SenSave works based on the observation that a lot of energy during photographing is wasted in preparations before shooting. By leveraging the low power-consuming embedded sensors, such as accelerometer and gyroscope, we can recognize the user’s activities and reduce unnecessary energy consumption. Besides, by maintaining an activity state machine, SenSave can determine the user’s activity progressively and improve the recognition accuracy. Experiment results show that SenSave can recognize the user’s activities with an average accuracy of 95.5% and reduce the energy consumption during photographing by 30.0%, when compared to the approach by frequently turning ON/OFF the camera or screen. Additionally, we enhance “SenSave” by introducing an extended Markov chain to predict the next activity state and adopt the energy-saving strategy in advance. Then, we can reduce the energy consumption during photographing by 36.1%.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, manufacturers want to send the data of their products to the cloud so that they can conduct analysis and improve their operation, maintenance, and services. Manufacturers are looking for a self-contained solution. This is because their products are deployed in a large number of different buildings, and it is neither feasible for a vendor to negotiate with each building to use the building’s network (e.g., WiFi) nor practical to establish its own network infrastructure. The vendor can rent a dedicated channel from an ISP to act as a thing-to-cloud communication (TCC) link for each of its IoT devices. The readily available choices, e.g., 3G, is over costly for most IoT devices. ISPs are developing cheaper choices for TCC links, yet we expect that the number of choices for TCC links will be small as compared to hundreds or thousands of requirements on different costs and data rates from IoT applications. We address this issue by proposing a communication sharing architecture sTube+, sharing tube . The objective of sTube+ is to organize a greater number of IoT devices, with heterogeneous data communication and cost requirements, to efficiently share fewer choices of TCC links and transmit their data to the cloud. We take a design of centralized price optimization and distributed network control. More specifically, we architect a layered architecture for data delivery, develop algorithms to optimize the overall monetary cost, and prototype a fully functioning system of sTube+. We evaluate sTube+ by both experiments and simulations. In addition, we develop a case study on smart maintenance of chillers and pumps, using sTube+ as the underlying network architecture.",

    "abstract": "Emerging countries predominantly rely on room-level air conditioning units (window ACs, space heaters, ceiling fans) for thermal comfort. These distributed units have manual, decentralized control leading to suboptimal energy usage for two reasons: excessive setpoints by individuals and inability to interleave different conditioning units for energy savings. We propose a novel inverted HVAC approach: cheaply retrofitting these distributed units with “on-off” control and providing centralized control augmented with room and environmental sensors. Our binary control approach exploits an understanding of device consumption characteristics and factors this into the control algorithms to reduce consumption. We implement this approach as H awadaar in a prototype 180ft 2 room to evaluate its efficacy over a 7-month period experiencing both hot and cold climates. Through a post analysis, we show that our on-off algorithms are not far from a theoretically optimal approach based on a priori information that precisely knows the optimal control points to minimize consumption. We collect enough evidence to plausibly scale our empirical evaluation, demonstrating countrywide benefits: with just 20% market penetration, H awadaar can save up to 6% of electricity per capita in residential and commercial sectors—resulting in a substantial countrywide impact.",

    "abstract": "As the scale and density of data centers continue to grow, cost-effective data center management (DCM) is becoming a significant challenge for enterprises hosting large-scale online and cloud services. Machines need to be monitored, and the scale of operations mandates an automated management with high reliability and real-time performance. The limitations of today’s typical DCM network are many-fold. Primarily, it is a fixed wired network, and hence scaling it for a large number of servers increases its cost. In addition, with server densities increasing over recent years, this network also has to be cabled correctly and the management of this network parallels the complexity of managing a data network, since it needs to be networked with multiple switches and routers. In this article, we propose a wireless sensor network as a cost-effective networking solution for DCM while satisfying the reliability and latency performance requirements of DCM. We have developed CapNet, a real-time wireless sensor network for power capping, a time-critical DCM function for power management in a cluster of servers. CapNet employs an efficient event-driven protocol that triggers data collection only on the detection of a potential power capping event. We deploy and evaluate CapNet in a data center. Using server power traces, our experimental results on a cluster of 480 servers inside the data center show that CapNet can meet the real-time requirements of power capping. CapNet demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of wireless sensor networks for time-critical DCM applications.",

Our technique makes joint use of two light-weight analytic methods—Iterative Edge Mining(IEM) and Cooperative Activity Sequence-based Map Matching(CASMM). IEM is a decision-tree classifier that uses acceleration data to estimate the activity state. The sequence of activities generated by IEM is analyzed by the CASMM method for identifying the location. The CASMM method uses cooperation between devices to improve accuracy of classification and then performs map matching to identify the location. We evaluate the performance of our approach for activity recognition and localization of animals. The evaluation is performed using real-world acceleration data of cows collected during a pilot study at a Dairygold-sponsored farm in Kilworth, Ireland. The analysis shows that our approach can achieve a localization accuracy of up to 99%. In addition, we exploit the location-awareness of devices and present an event-driven communication approach to transmit data from the IoT devices to the cloud. The delay-tolerant communication facilitates context-aware sensing and significantly improves energy profile of the devices. Furthermore, an array-based implementation of IEM is discussed, and resource assessment is performed to verify its suitability for device-based implementation.",

All these works use a charging model with the linear superposition, which may not be the most accurate. We apply a nonlinear superposition model, and we consider the Fast Charging Scheduling problem (FCS): Given multiple chargers and a group of sensors, how can the chargers be optimally scheduled over the time dimension so that the total charging time is minimized and each sensor has at least energy E ? We prove that FCS is NP-complete and propose a 2-approximation algorithm to solve it in one-dimensional (1D) line. In a 2D plane, we first consider a special case of FCS, where the initial phases of all chargers are the same, and propose an algorithm to solve it, which has a bound. Then we propose an algorithm to solve FCS in a general 2D plane. Unlike other algorithms, our algorithm does not need to calculate the combined energy of every possible combination of chargers in advance, which greatly reduces the complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the performance of our algorithm performs almost as good as the optimal algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion on urban roadways is a serious problem requiring novel ways to detect and mitigate it. Determining the routes that lead to the traffic congestion segment is also vital in devising mitigation strategies. Further, crowdsourcing this information allows for use of these strategies quickly and in places where infrastructure is not available. In this work, we present an unconventional method, using the barometer sensor of mobile phones to (a) detect road traffic congestion and (b) estimate the paths that lead to the congested road segment. We make the observation that roads are not completely flat and very often, altitude varies along the road. The barometer sensor chips are sensitive enough to measure these variations and consume very little energy of the mobile phone, compared to other sensors such as the GPS or accelerometer. We devise a feature set to map the rate of change of this altitude as the user moves into activities characterized as “still” and “motion,” which are further used by the traffic congestion detection algorithm (RoadSphygmo) to classify the group of users as being in “moving,” “congestion,” or “stuck” states. To estimate the paths that lead to the congested road segment, we compare the user’s barometer sensor readings with a pre-stored road signature of barometer values using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We show that by using correlation of barometer sensor values, we can determine if users are in the same vehicle. We crowdsource this information from multiple mobile phones and use majority voting technique to improve the accuracy of traffic congestion detection and path estimation. We find a significant increase in the accuracies using crowdsourced information as compared to individual mobile phones. Further, we show that we can use barometer sensor for other applications such as bus occupancy, boarding/deboarding of a vehicle, and so on. The validation of the state determined by RoadSphygmo is done by comparing it with average GPS speed calculated during the same time period. The path estimation is validated over different intersections and considering various cases of commuter travel. The results obtained are promising and show that the traffic state determination and the estimation of the path taken by the commuter can achieve high accuracy.",

However, it becomes more difficult to strike the balance between a driver’s profit and a passenger’s quality of service (QoS). In this article, we propose QA-Share, a QoS-aware taxi-sharing system, by addressing two important challenges. First, QA-Share maximizes driver profit and user experience at the same time. Second, QA-Share optimizes these two metrics by dynamically adapting its schedule as new requests arrive. To address these two challenges, we formulated the optimization problem using integer linear programming and derived the optimal solution under a small system scale. Moreover, we also designed a heuristic algorithm to deal with the situation where more passenger requests for taxi service come at the same time. We evaluate our approach with a real-world dataset in a Chinese city—Zhenjiang—that contains the GPS traces recorded by more than 3,000 taxis during a period of 3 months. The results show that both QoS and profit increase by 38% compared to the current schemes. Moreover, as the first study that has conducted simulations with real traces with a population of 3 million and 3,000 taxis, we prove that taxi-sharing is a viable approach in a medium-size city.",

    "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has engendered a new paradigm of integrated sensing and actuation systems for intelligent monitoring and control of smart homes and buildings. One viable manifestation is that of IoT-empowered smart lighting systems, which rely on the interplay between smart light bulbs (equipped with controllable LED devices and wireless connectivity) and mobile sensors (possibly embedded in users’ wearable devices such as smart watches, spectacles, and gadgets) to provide automated illuminance control functions tailored to users’ preferences (e.g., of brightness, color intensity, or color temperature). Typically, practical deployment of these systems precludes the adoption of sophisticated but costly location-aware sensors capable of accurately mapping out the details of a dynamic operational environment. Instead, cheap oblivious mobile sensors are often utilized, which are plagued with uncertainty in their relative locations to sensors and light bulbs. The imposed volatility, in turn, impedes the design of effective smart lighting systems for uncertain indoor environments with multiple sensors and light bulbs. With this in view, the present article sheds light on the adaptive control algorithms and modeling of such systems. First, a general model formulation of an oblivious multisensor illuminance control problem is proposed, yielding a robust framework agnostic to a dynamic surrounding environment and time-varying background light sources. Under this model, we devise efficient algorithms inducing continuous adaptive lighting control that minimizes energy consumption of light bulbs while meeting users’ preferences. The algorithms are then studied under extensive empirical evaluations in a proof-of-concept smart lighting testbed featuring LIFX programmable bulbs and smartphones (deployed as light sensing units). Lastly, we conclude by discussing the potential improvements in hardware development and highlighting promising directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "Understanding customer mobility patterns to commercial districts is crucial for urban planning, facility management, and business strategies. Trade areas are a widely applied measure to quantify where the visitors are from. Traditional trade area analysis is limited to small-scale or store-level studies, because information such as visits to competitor commercial entities and place of residence is collected by labour-intensive questionnaires or heavily biased location-based social media data. In this article, we propose CellTradeMap, a novel district-level trade area analysis framework using mobile flow records (MFRs), a type of fine-grained cellular network data. We show that compared to traditional cellular data and social network check-in data, MFRs can model customer mobility patterns comprehensively at urban scale. CellTradeMap extracts robust location information from the irregularly sampled, noisy MFRs, adapts the generic trade area analysis framework to incorporate cellular data, and enhances the original trade area model with cellular-based features. We evaluate CellTradeMap on two large-scale cellular network datasets covering 3.5 million and 1.8 million mobile phone users in two metropolis in China, respectively. Experimental results show that the trade areas extracted by CellTradeMap are aligned with domain knowledge and CellTradeMap can model trade areas with a high predictive accuracy.",

    "abstract": "An unprecedented rate of growth in the number of vehicles has resulted in acute road congestion problems worldwide, especially in many developing countries. In this article, we present Road-RFSense, a practical RF sensing--based road traffic estimation system for developing regions. Our first contribution is a new mechanism to sense road occupancy, based on variation in RF link characteristics, when line of sight between a transmitter-receiver pair is obstructed. We design algorithms to classify traffic states into two classes, free-flow versus congested, at timescales of 20 seconds with greater than 90% accuracy. We also present a traffic queue length measurement system, where a network of RF sensors can correlate the traffic state classification decisions of individual sensors and detect traffic queue length in real time. Deployment of our system on a Mumbai road gives correct estimates, validated against 9 hours of image-based ground truth. Our third contribution is a large-scale data-driven study, in collaboration with city traffic authorities, to answer questions regarding road-specific classification model training. Finally, we explore multilevel classification into seven different traffic states using a larger set of RF-based features and careful choice of classification algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are often deployed to sample the desired environmental attributes and deliver the acquired samples to a central station, termed as the sink, for processing as needed by the application. Many applications stipulate high granularity and data accuracy that results in high data volumes. However, sensor nodes are battery powered, and sending the requested large amounts of data rapidly depletes their energy. Fortunately, environmental attributes (e.g., temperature, pressure) often exhibit spatial and temporal correlations. Moreover, a large class of applications such as scientific analysis and simulations tolerate high latency for sensor data collection. Hence, we exploit the spatiotemporal correlation of sensor readings while benefiting from possible data delivery latency tolerance to minimize the amount of data to be transported to the sink. Accordingly, we develop a fully distributed adaptive hybrid compression scheme that exploits both spatial and temporal data redundancies and fuses both temporal and spatial compression for maximal data compression with accuracy guarantees. We present two main contributions: (i) an adaptive modeling technique that allows frugal and maximized temporal compression on resource-constraint sensor nodes by exploiting the data collection latency, and (ii) a novel model-based hierarchical clustering technique that allows for maximized spatial compression resulting into a hybrid compression scheme. Compared to the existing spatiotemporal compression approaches, our approach is fully decentralized and the proposed clustering scheme is based on sensor data models rather than instantaneous sensor data values, which allows merging nearby nodes with similar models into large clusters over a longer period of time rather than specific time instances. The analysis for computation and message overheads, the analysis for theoretical compressibility, and simulations using real-world data demonstrate that our proposed scheme can provide significant communication/energy savings without sacrificing the accuracy of collected data.",

Here we study the computation of the range of overall values consistent with the data and provide several results. Posed as a linear programming problem, this leads to questions associated with the geometry of the sensor regions, specifically the arrangement of their nonempty intersections. We define a computational tool called the fusion polytope , based on the geometry of the sensing regions. Its properties are explored, and in particular, a topological necessary and sufficient condition for this to be in the positive orthant, a property that considerably simplifies calculations, is provided.

To mitigate this, we in this article propose a framework named AQuaMoHo that can annotate data obtained from a low-cost thermo-hygrometer (as the sole physical sensing device) with the AQI labels, with the help of additional publicly crawled Spatio-temporal information of that locality. At its core, AQuaMoHo exploits the temporal patterns from a set of readily available spatial features using an LSTM-based model and further enhances the overall quality of the annotation using temporal attention. From a thorough study of two different cities, we observe that AQuaMoHo can significantly help annotate the air quality data on a personal scale.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the flourish of the internet of things incurs a great demand for progressive technologies to prolong the lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks. Exploiting a fleet of Mobile Chargers (MCs) to replenish the energy-critical sensor nodes provides a new dimension to maintain long-term network operations, but may suffer from high charging delay due to MC’s limited mobility. Most existing studies focus on the reduction of server-oriented delay, i.e., the overall time taken by MCs (servers) to carry out sensor charging and travel inside the sensing field. However, these solutions may not be robust enough as some energy-critical sensor nodes will run out of the stored energy before the charger’s arrival. In this article, we address this challenge by reducing the client-oriented delay—referred to as the wait-for delay —which is defined as the “arrival times” at the to-be-charged sensor nodes (clients). To this end, we first formulate a novel wait-for charging delay minimization problem under the multi-node energy charging scheme. We then prove the NP-hardness of the proposed problem. Inspired by empirical observations, we devise an efficient approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the problem. We have evaluated the proposed algorithm using real-life system settings. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm certainly performs better than the existing benchmarks; it could reduce the wait-for delay by up to 87.4 percent.",

One effective scheme known as DNN partition further improves the speed of the inference by partitioning the DNN to a mobile device and its connected edge server to jointly process the inference. However, one of the challenges is how to maintain the service during handovers to avoid interruptions. Inspired by the recently developed early exit technique, where the DNN inference can be accelerated by leaving at an earlier exit point, we propose eDeepSave, a promising solution to save a large portion of video frames that cannot be handled during handovers. eDeepSave comprises three subschemes: (1) save the partially completed frames that are affected when the handover begins. (2) determine which frames we should save during a handover to maximize the number of saved frames. (3) repartition the last arriving frame before the end of the handover with a provable performance bound so that the frames after the handover can be processed without experiencing congestion. We build up a real-world prototype for the field experiments and extensive simulations, showing that eDeepSave can save up to 100% of the affected frames during handover.",

    "abstract": "As sensor-based networks become more prevalent, scaling to unmanageable numbers or deployed in difficult to reach areas, real-time failure localisation is becoming essential for continued operation. Network tomography, a system and application-independent approach, has been successful in localising complex failures (i.e., observable by end-to-end global analysis) in traditional networks. Applying network tomography to wireless sensor networks (WSNs), however, is challenging. First, WSN topology changes due to environmental interactions (e.g., interference). Additionally, the selection of devices for running network monitoring processes (monitors) is an NP-hard problem. Monitors observe end-to-end in-network properties to identify failures, with their placement impacting the number of identifiable failures. Since monitoring consumes more in-node resources, it is essential to minimise their number while maintaining network tomography’s effectiveness. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art solutions solve this optimisation problem using time-consuming greedy heuristics. In this article, we propose two solutions for efficiently applying Network Tomography in WSNs: a graph compression scheme, enabling faster monitor placement by reducing the number of edges in the network, and an adaptive monitor placement algorithm for recovering the monitor placement given topology changes. The experiments show that our solution is at least 1,000× faster than the state-of-the-art approaches and efficiently copes with topology variations in large-scale WSNs.",

The need for multiple sensors and constant monitoring leads these systems to be power hungry and expensive with short operating lifetimes.

This, in turn, directly influences the wireless communication and local processing power consumption. We exploit intrinsic space and temporal correlations between sensor data while considering both user and system contextual behavior. Our goal is to select a small subset of sensors that accurately capture and/or predict all possible signals of a fully instrumented wearable sensing system. Our approach leverages novel modeling, partitioning, and behavioral optimization, which consists of signal characterization, segmentation and time shifting, mutual signal prediction, and a simultaneous minimization composed of subset sensor selection and opportunistic sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on an insole instrumented with 99 pressure sensors placed in each shoe, which cover the bottom of the entire foot, resulting in energy reduction of 72% to 97% for error rates of 5% to 17.5%.",

Our work is set in the context of those wireless sensor network applications which collect and transfer bulk data. We present PIP (Packets in Pipe), a MAC primitive for use by the transport module to achieve high throughput. PIP has a unique set of features: (a) it is a multihop connection-oriented primitive, (b) it is TDMA based, (c) it uses multiple radio channels, and (d) it is centrally controlled. This represents a significant shift from prior MAC protocols for bulk data transfer. PIP has several desirable properties: (a) its throughput degrades only slightly with increasing number of hops, (b) it is robust to variable wireless error rates, (c) it performs well even without any flow control, and (d) requires only small queue sizes to operate well. We substantiate these properties with a prototype implementation of PIP on the Tmote-Sky CC2420-based platform. PIP achieves about eleven times better throughput than the state-of-the-art prior work, over a network depth of 24 hops. We also show that PIP can be interagted with duty cycling, and that PIP can support streaming data from/to flash at little overhead.",

Grayspace operations are particularly interesting when other unlicensed bands are overcrowded, for example, due to high-volume WiFi operations. We simulate the operational characteristics of the recent IEEE 802.15.4m standard for low-rate wireless personal area networks to evaluate the performance degradation of an incumbent Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial (DVB-T) system if a secondary network of low-power low-rate devices are co-deployed in the same frequency bands. Our results show that short sensor messages will not disrupt the DVB-T service due to the existing error-correction capabilities. Furthermore, if sufficient separation distances to primary transmitters are maintained, transmit powers are sufficient to achieve reasonable connectivity levels of the secondary network. In order to obtain realistic figures on the predicted feasibility of grayspace sensor networks, we study the deployment constraints of a hypothetical secondary network co-located with the TV broadcasting network of Germany. Our analysis shows that if we aim to support a minimum sensor-sensor distance, no universal coverage can be maintained in this country. While our quantitative results are specific to Germany, we deem them indicative for the expected results also in other potential deployments. We found that while a secondary wireless sensor network in TVGS is technically possible, the necessary constraints on operational parameters and service levels for TVGS co-existence will significantly limit its practical viability.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of clock synchronization in a wireless setting where processors must minimize the number of times their radios are used to save energy. Energy efficiency is a central goal in wireless networks, especially if energy resources are severely limited, as occurs in sensor and ad hoc networks, and in many other settings. The problem of clock synchronization is fundamental and intensively studied in the field of distributed algorithms. In the current setting, the problem is to synchronize clocks of m processors that wake up in arbitrary time points, such that the maximum difference between wake-up times is bounded by a positive integer n . (Time intervals are appropriately discretized to allow communication of all processors that are awake in the same discrete time unit.) Currently, the best-known results for synchronization for single-hop networks of m processors is a randomized algorithm due to Bradonjic et al. [2009] of O (√ n / m ⋅ poly - log ( n )) radio use times per processor, and a lower bound of Ω (√ n / m ). The main open question left in their work is to close the poly-log gap between the upper and the lower bound, and to derandomize their probabilistic construction and eliminate error probability. This is exactly what we do in this article. That is, we show a deterministic algorithm with radio use of Θ (√ n / m ), which exactly matches the lower bound proven in Bradonjic et al. [2009] to a small multiplicative constant. Therefore, our algorithm is optimal in terms of energy efficiency and completely resolves a long sequence of works in this area [Bradonjic et al. 2009; Moscribroda et al. 2006; McGlynn and Borbash 2001; Polastre et al. 2004]. Moreover, our algorithm is optimal in terms of running time as well. To achieve these results, we devise a novel adaptive technique that determines the times when devices power their radios on and off. This technique may be of independent interest. In addition, we prove several lower bounds on the energy efficiency of algorithms for multihop networks. Specifically, we show that any algorithm for multihop networks must have radio use of Ω (√ n ) per processor. Our lower bounds hold even for specific kinds of networks, such as networks modeled by unit disk graphs and highly connected graphs. Our results imply that the simple deterministic algorithm devised for two-processor networks in Bradonjic et al. [2009] with efficiency O (√ n ) can be used in multihop networks, and it is the most efficient solution in terms of energy use.",

Among special smart critical infrastructure failures, the sleeping cell failure is hard to address since no alarm is generally triggered. Sleeping cells can remain undetected for a long time and can severely affect the quality of service/quality of experience to users. To enhance the resiliency of the SBSs in sleeping cells, we design a mobile edge-cloud computing system and propose a semi-supervised learning-based framework to dynamically detect the sleeping cells. Particularly, we consider two indicators, recovery proportion and recovery speed, to measure the resiliency of the SBSs. Moreover, in the proposed scheme, experts’ optimization experience and each period’s detection results can be utilized to iteratively improve the performance. Then we adopt a dataset from real-world networks for performance evaluation. Trace-driven evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing sleeping cell detection schemes, and can also reduce the communication and runtime costs and enhance the resiliency of the SBSs.",

However, prior solutions such as X-ray diffraction and WiFi-based detection are not suitable for this purpose. X-ray-based methods usually require manual analysis or image processing algorithms with high complexity, while WiFi-based solutions may fail to detect complex structures due to the significant error of the RF-signal features. In this article, we propose RF-Detector, a low-cost RFID solution for performing three-dimensional (3D) structure detection of items contained in the packages, including the item orientations and relative locations. We thoroughly investigate a brand-new sensing model for RFID-based 3D structure detection, i.e., revolving scanning. We propose not only the fundamental revolving model but also a novel calibration method for the undesired deployments. We have implemented a prototype system to evaluate the performance of RF-Detector. Extensive evaluations in real settings show the effectiveness of RF-Detector, achieving very high accuracy of the internal 3D structure detection.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) is an essential technology for modern intelligent sensor network and interactive multimedia applications, having problems with user data privacy when training on a central cloud. While Federated Learning (FL) motivates to preserve user privacy, it also causes new problems of lower user terminal usability and training efficiency, which caused substantial energy consumption. This article proposes a novel energy-efficient and privacy-aware decomposition framework to improve user-side FL efficiency under pre-defined privacy requirements with the assistance of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Software Decomposition. It takes the propagation of each neural layer as the migrating unit and considers the tradeoff relationship between privacy and efficiency. We also propose an online scheduling algorithm to optimize the framework’s training performance. Furthermore, we summarize eight privacy-sensitive information classes on which existing privacy attacks base and design configurable privacy preservation mechanisms for each class. Simulations and experiments prove the effectiveness of our framework and algorithm in FL efficiency improvement and the effects of different privacy constraints on the overall training efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Gait rehabilitation is a common method of postoperative recovery after the user sustains an injury or disability. However, traditional gait rehabilitations are usually performed under the supervision of rehabilitation specialists, which implies that the patients cannot receive adequate gait assessment anytime and anywhere. In this article, we propose GaitTracker, a novel system to remotely and continuously perform gait monitoring and analysis by three-dimensional (3D) skeletal tracking in a wearable approach. Specifically, this system consists of four Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), which are attached on the shanks and thighs of the human body. According to the measurements from these IMUs, we can obtain the motion signals of lower limbs during gait rehabilitation. By adaptively synchronizing coordinate systems of different IMUs and building the geometric model of lower limbs, the exact gait movements can be reconstructed, and gait parameters can be extracted without any prior knowledge. GaitTracker offers three key features: (1) a unified 3D skeletal model to depict the precise gait movement and parameters in 3D space, (2) a coordinate system synchronization scheme to perform space synchronization over all the IMU sensors, and (3) an automatic estimation method for the user-specific geometric parameters. In this way, GaitTracker is able to accurately perform 3D skeletal tracking of lower limbs for gait analysis, such as evaluating the gait symmetry and the gait parameters including the swing/stance time. We implemented GaitTracker and evaluated its performance in real applications. The experimental results show that, the average error for skeleton angle estimation, joint displacement estimation, and gait parameter estimation are 3∘, 2.3%, and 3%, respectively, outperforming the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining fine-grained spatial information is of practical importance in Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-based systems for enabling multi-object identification. However, as high-precision positioning remains impractical in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)-RFID systems, researchers propose to combine computer vision (CV) with RFID and turn the positioning problem into a matching problem. Promising though it seems, current methods fuse CV and RFID through converting traces of tagged objects extracted from videos by CV into phase sequences for matching, which is a dimension-reduced procedure causing loss of spatial resolution. Consequently, they fail in harsh conditions like small tag intervals and low reading rates. To address the limitation, we propose TagFocus to achieve fine-grained multi-object identification with visual aids in RFID systems. The key observation is that traces generated through different methods shall be compatible if they are of one identical object. Accordingly, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model is trained to generate a simulated trace for each candidate tag-object pair. And the trace of the right pair shall best match the observed trace directly extracted by CV. A prototype of TagFocus is implemented and extensively assessed in lab environments. Experimental results show that our system maintains a matching accuracy of over 91% in harsh conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art schemes by 27%.",

In this article, we investigate a novel deep-reinforcement-learning-based spectrum-sharing paradigm, termed Intelligent Overlapping, that explores partially overlapping channels for concurrent spectrum access in LoRaWAN. Our key insight is to leverage the coding redundancy to expand the available spectrum without complicated data processing algorithms. In particular, we learn the extra coding redundancy from the data on the non-overlapping spectrum via a deep-Q-learning network, and we apply such redundancy to recover the data on the overlapping spectrum. In the Media Access Control layer, we predict the channel condition and strategically learn and assign the appropriate overlapping portion to the concurrent access end devices. In the Physical layer, we harness interleaving to randomize the mutual interference to ensure that all the data remains decodable. Simulation results demonstrate that Intelligent Overlapping greatly improves the spectrum efficiency with a fast convergence rate compared to the conventional DSM mechanisms.",

We consider the temporal dependency of the driving data for individual drivers and the spatial correlation among different drivers. Second, to incorporate the peer dependency of drivers in local regions, we develop a geographical partitioning algorithm to partition a city into several sub-regions to do the driving anomaly detection. Specifically, we extend the vehicle-vehicle dependency to road-road dependency and formulate the geographical partitioning problem into an optimization problem. The objective of the optimization problem is to maximize the dependency of roads within each sub-region and minimize the dependency of roads between any two different sub-regions. Finally, we train a specific driving anomaly detection model for each sub-region and perform in-situ updating of these models by incremental training.

On the other hand, users are divided into active users and passive users according to the historical movement law of sensing users. Secondly, the participant selection in the first stage is carried out. According to the similarity of feature space between the source task and the target task, part of the user resources of the source task are migrated to the target subtask with a similar distribution of its feature space. As a result, the target task can select participants efficiently and accurately. Finally, the participant selection in the second stage is carried out.

Existing collision decoding methods cannot effectively deal with the adjacent collisions that occur when the collided symbols are adjacent in the frequency spectrum. The decoding features relied on by the existing methods will be corrupted by adjacent collisions. To address these issues, we propose Paralign , which is the first LoRa collision decoder supporting decoding LoRa collisions with confusing symbols via parallel alignment. The key enabling technology behind Paralign is tha there is no spectrum leakage with periodic truncation of a chirp. Paralign leverages the precise spectrum obtained by aligning the de-chirped periodic signals from each packet in parallel for spectrum filtering and power filtering. To aggregate correlation peaks in different windows of the same symbol, Paralign matches the peaks of multiple interfering windows to the interested window based on the time offset between collided packets. Moreover, a periodic truncation method is proposed to address the multiple candidate peak problem caused by side lobes of confusing symbols. We evaluate Paralign using USRP N210 in a 20-node network. Experimental results demonstrate that Paralign can significantly improve network throughput, which is over 1.46× higher than state-of-the-art methods.",

We propose a mathematical model to describe the energy efficiency of such networks and observe that traditional sleep interval setting strategies, for example, operating sensor nodes with an identical sleep interval, or intuitive control heuristics, for example, greedily increasing sleep intervals of sensor nodes with high energy consumption rates, hardly perform well in practice. There is an urgent need to develop an efficient sleep interval control strategy for achieving fair and high energy efficiency. To this end, we theoretically formulate the Sleep Interval Control (SIC) problem and find out that it is a convex optimization problem. By utilizing the convex property, we decompose the original problem and propose a distributed algorithm, called GDSIC. In GDSIC, sensor nodes can tune sleep intervals through a local information exchange such that the maximum energy consumption rate of the network approaches to be minimized. The algorithm is self-adjustable to the traffic load variance and is able to serve as a unified framework for a variety of asynchronous duty-cycling MAC protocols. We implement our approach in a prototype system and test its feasibility and applicability on a 50-node testbed.

Cloud and sensor technology is widely deployed in a several real-time applications, especially in agriculture. The transformation of data obtained from large sensor networks into a valuable knowledge and assests for applications can effectively leverage the techniques like Cloud Computing (CC). In CC, scheduling the workflow is the major concern that focuses on comprehensive execution of workflows without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS). But workflow scheduling augmented with resource allocation is extremely challenging task because of its inherent computational intensity, task dependencies, and heterogeneous cloud resources. In this article, a novel Optimum Energy and Resource Aware Workflow Scheduling (OERES) scheme that is motivated by popular Fuzzy Membership Mutation Elephant Herding Optimization (FMMEHO) algorithm is proposed, that aims to schedule the task workflow to Virtual Machines (VMs) that are involved in computation. This also concentrates on dynamically deploying and un-deploying the VMs pertaining to the task requirements. The FMMEHO algorithm is a popular nature inspired technique, which is rooted on herding patterns of the giant mammals, the elephants. This algorithm employs a clan operator that updates the location and distance of elephants depending resource and energy usage of each clan in the context of matriarch elephant. The proposed OERES schema elevates the resource utilization and simultaneously mitigates the energy usage without compromising the dependency and deadline constraints. This work uses the famous Cloud Sim simulator to simulate the underlying cloud environment to investigate the effectiveness of proposed model. The efficacy of the scheduling methods is examined based on important parameters like mean Resource Utilization (RU), Energy utilization or Consumption/ Task (ECT), Total Energy Consumption (TEC), Makespan and Execution Time per Task (ETT). The results very well portray the effectiveness of proposed OERES algorithm against already existing methods.",

By attaching these sensors to an off-the-shelf casual jacket, we developed a smart loose-fitting sensing garment that enables posture recognition using a deep learning model, domain-adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks–Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM). This deep learning model overcame the noise and variation due to the complex interaction between loose-fitting garments and human body. Considering that users’ labeled data are usually not available in the training stage, an additional domain discriminator path on the conventional CNN-LSTM model has been introduced to further improve the adaptability. To evaluate the potential of this loose-fitting smart garment, three case studies were conducted under realistic conditions: recognitions of human activities, stationary postures with random hand movements and slouch.

    "abstract": "Due to their large bandwidth and impressive data speed, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radios are expected to play a key role in the 5G and beyond (e.g., 6G) communication networks. Yet, to release mmWave’s true power, the highly directional mmWave beams need to be aligned perfectly. Most existing beam alignment methods adopt an exhaustive or semi-exhaustive space scanning, which introduces up to seconds of delays. To eliminate the need for complex space scanning, this article presents an Ultra-wideband (UWB)-assisted mmWave communication framework, which leverages the co-located UWB antennas to estimate the best angles for mmWave beam alignment. One major challenge of applying this idea in the real world is the barrier of limited antenna numbers. Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices are usually equipped with only a small number of UWB antennas, which are not enough for the existing algorithms to provide an accurate angle estimation. To solve this challenge, we design a novel Multi-Frequency MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MF-MUSIC) algorithm, which extends the classic MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm to the frequency domain and overcomes the antenna limitation barrier in the spatial domain. Extensive real-world experiments and numerical simulations illustrate the advantage of the proposed MF-MUSIC algorithm. MF-MUSIC uses only three antennas to achieve an accurate angle estimation, which is a mere 0.15° (or a relative difference of 3.6%) different from the state-of-the-art 16-antenna-based angle estimation method.",

This article presents efficient algorithms to partition MRRCs and MGRCs and develops an open-sourced toolbox, GPART, for these algorithms to be conveniently used by the society. We firstly propose conditions and an efficient algorithm to merge the over-constrained regions to form the maximal redundant rigid components (MRRC). The detected MRRCs are proved to be maximal and all the MRRCs are guaranteed to be detected. The time to merge the over-constrained regions is linear to the number of nodes in the over-constrained components. To detect MGRCs, the critical problem is to decompose 3-connected components in each MRRC. We exploit SPQR-tree based method and design a local optimization algorithm, called MGRC_acce to prune the unnecessary decomposition operations so that the SPQR-tree functions can be called much less number of times. We prove the MGRCs can be detected inside MRRCs using at most O(mn ) time. Then a GPART toolbox is developed and extensively tested in graphs of different densities. We show the proposed MRRC and MGRC detection algorithms are valid and MGRC_acce greatly outperforms the direct SPQR-tree based decomposition algorithm.

However, the literature still lacks a holistic review of adversarial games in AML. In this paper, we extend the scope of previous surveys and provide a thorough overview of existing game theoretical approaches in AML for adaptively defending against adversarial attacks. For evaluating these approaches, we propose a set of metrics to discuss their merits and drawbacks.

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in 5G networks is designed to support time-critical applications such as industrial control systems (ICSs), where user equipment (UEs) communicate with a base station (BS) with very high reliability and low latency. Most of these communications in ICSs are periodic and associated with hard deadlines. To provide a reliable service while satisfying the hard deadlines, the BS usually reserves slots and frequencies and precomputes the schedule for such UEs. The same schedule repeats over time, which makes the slots and frequencies predictable. However, an attacker can exploit this aspect and launch timing attacks disrupting specific communication, thereby, undermining the safety of the system. To mitigate such attacks, we present an online strategy that randomizes the scheduled slots and frequencies over time without violating the flow deadlines. We use Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure the randomness in the schedules generated by our strategy with reference to a hypothetical truly random strategy. We perform security analysis of our proposed strategy using Prediction Probability to measure the predictability in the slots of the generated schedules. We evaluate the performance of our strategy against a state-of-the-art baseline, and show that our strategy performs better than the baseline across all parameter settings.",

    "abstract": "Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), extensively utilized for connecting billions of IoT devices, encounter wireless interference challenges in unlicensed frequency bands. Cutting-edge research suggests employing Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) sequences for error detection to mitigate interference-related issues. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this method significantly declines under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Additionally, long-range communication often results in low SNR received signals, sometimes even below the noise floor. Targeting this fundamental issue, this article proposes the LPWAN packet technique, broadly applicable across diverse scenarios through edge–cloud collaboration. On the edge side, we propose an innovative architecture that fully exploits spatial distribution and interference independence in the field. Rather than utilizing resource-intensive RSSI-based error detection, we leverage a lightweight coding scheme for error detection at the Long Range (LoRa) edge, forwarding correct frames to the cloud. On the cloud side, packet recovery is achieved utilizing group-weighted voting. We design and implement ECRLoRa with commercially available devices (SemTech’s SX1278 and SX1302 LoRa chipsets) and assess its performance in low SNR environments. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates that our approach attains a Packet Recovery Ratio of 96% with low SNR (i.e., below −10 dB), resulting in 1.8× throughput, 7.5× faster recovery time, and 4.92× average accuracy compared to state-of-the-art cloud-optimized application layer solutions.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm offers extended coverage and is a vital solution for many applications. A key issue in UAV swarm control is to cover all targets while maintaining connectivity among UAVs, referred to as a multi-target coverage problem. With existing dynamic routing protocols, the flying ad hoc network suffers outdated and incorrect route information due to frequent topology changes. This might lead to failures of time-critical tasks. One mitigation solution is to keep the physical topology unchanged, thus maintaining a fixed communication topology and enabling static routing. However, keeping physical topology unchanged may sacrifice the coverage. In this article, we propose to maintain a fixed communication topology among UAVs, which allows certain changes in physical topology, so that to maximize the coverage. We develop a distributed motion planning algorithm for the online multi-target coverage problem with the constraint of keeping communication topology intact. As the communication topology needs to be timely updated when UAVs leave or arrive at the swarm, we further design a topology-management protocol. Experimental results from the ns-3 simulator show that under our algorithms, UAV swarms of different sizes achieve significantly improved delay and loss ratio, efficient coverage, and rapid topology update.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the emerging development of single-antenna wireless respiration detection that can be integrated into IoT devices with a single transceiver chain. However, existing single-antenna-based solutions are all limited by the short sensing range within 2-4 m due to noise interference, which makes them difficult to be adopted in most room-scale scenarios. To deal with this dilemma, we propose a room-scale, noise-resistance, and accurate respiration monitoring system, named Wi-Cyclops , 1 which captures CSI changes induced by respiratory movements only via one antenna on commercial WiFi devices. To push the limits of effective sensing distance, we innovatively supply a new perspective to review the CSI samples along the sub-carrier dimension. From this dimension, we find that the interrelationship between sub-carriers with different timestamps still shows a high correlation even though the SNR decreases. Based on that, we analyze the noise characteristics along the sub-carrier dimension and correspondingly design a series of denoising schemes. Specifically, we carefully design a PCA-based denoising method to filter out ambient noises. After that, considering the low distribution densities of the AGC-induced noise, we then remove it by optimizing the DBSCAN denoising method with the K-Means-based adaptive radius search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can work effectively in three typical family scenarios. Wi-Cyclops can achieve 98% accuracy even when the person is 7 m away from the transceiver pair. Compared with the start-of-art single-antenna-based approaches in real scenarios, Wi-Cyclops can improve the sensing range from 3 m to 7 m, which can meet the requirements of room-scale respiration monitoring. Additionally, to show the high compatibility with smart home devices, Wi-Cyclops is deployed on seven commercial IoT devices and still achieves a low average absolute error with 0.41 bpm.",

The design is therefore effective in dealing with low signal-to-noise ratio and uncertain reflected signals from the UAV.

    "abstract": "As the next-generation battery substitute for IoT system, energy harvesting (EH) technology revolutionizes the IoT industry with environmental friendliness, ubiquitous accessibility, and sustainability, which enables various self-sustaining IoT applications. However, due to the weak and intermittent nature of EH power, the performance of EH-powered IoT systems as well as its collaborative routing mechanism can severely deteriorate, rendering unpleasant data package loss during each power failure. Such a phenomenon makes conventional routing policies and energy allocation strategies impractical. Given the complexity of the problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be one of the most promising and applicable methods to address this challenge. Nevertheless, although the energy allocation and routing policy are jointly optimized by the RL method, due to the energy restriction of EH devices, the inappropriate configuration of multi-hop network topology severely degrades the data collection performance. Therefore, this article first conducts a thorough mathematical discussion and develops the topology design and validation algorithm under energy harvesting scenarios. Then, this article develops DeepIoTRouting , a distributed and scalable deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to address the routing and energy allocation jointly for the energy harvesting powered distributed IoT system. The experimental results show that with topology optimization, DeepIoTRouting achieves at least 38.71% improvement on the amount of data delivery to sink in a 20-device IoT network, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Each SonicDoor is instrumented with ultrasonic ping sensors, one on top sensing height and two on the sides of the door sensing width of the person walking through the door. SonicDoor detects a walking event and analyzes it to infer whether the Walker is using a phone, holding a handbag, or wearing a backpack. It extracts a set of features from the walking event and corrects them using a set of transformation functions to mitigate the bias. We deployed five SonicDoors in a real building for two months and collected data consisting of over 9,000 walking events spanning over 170 people.

    "abstract": "Due to the random and dynamic energy-harvesting process, it is challenging to conduct optimal rate control in Energy-Harvesting Communication Systems (EHCSs). Existing works mainly focus on two cases: (1) the traffic load is infinite (as long as there is energy, there is data to transmit), in which the objective is to optimize the rate control policy subject to the dynamic energy arrivals, thus maximizing the average system throughput; and (2) the traffic load is finite, in which the objective is to optimize the rate control policy, thus minimizing the time by which all packets are delivered. In this work, we focus on the optimal rate control of EHCSs from another important and practical perspective, where the data and energy arrivals are both random. Given any deadline of T , our goal is to maximize the total throughput in [0, T ]. Specifically, two scenarios are considered: (1) energy is ready before the transmission; and (2) energy arrives randomly during the transmission. In both scenarios, we assume that the data arrive randomly during the transmission. For the first scenario, we develop a novel Stepwise Searching Algorithm (SSA) based on the cumulative curve methodology, which is shown to achieve the optimal solution and the complexity grows only linearly with the problem size. In addition, the SSA can provide a simple and appealing graphical visualization of approximating the optimal solution. For the second scenario, we provide a simplified case study that can be solved by the SSA with low computation overhead and demonstrate the difficulties in solving the general setting, which initiates a first step toward the full understanding of the scenario when energy arrives randomly during the transmission.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) have been widely used in various civilian applications, most of which involve only a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In the near future, more and more UAS applications will be facilitated by the cooperation of multiple UAVs. In such applications, it is desirable to utilize a general control platform for cooperative UAVs. However, existing open-source control platforms cannot fulfill such a demand because (1) they only support the leader-follower mode, which limits the design options for fleet control, (2) existing platforms can support only certain type of UAVs and thus lack compatibility, and (3) these platforms cannot accurately simulate a flight mission, which may cause a big gap between simulation and real-world flight. To address these issues, we propose a general control and monitoring platform for cooperative UAS, namely, CoUAS , which provides a set of core cooperation services of UAVs, including synchronization, connectivity management, path planning, energy simulation, and so on. To verify the applicability of CoUAS, we design and develop a prototype in which an embedded path planning service is provided to complete any task with the minimum flying time while considering the network connectivity and coverage. Experimental results by both simulation and field test demonstrate that the proposed system is viable.",

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology has been widely used in missing tag identification to reduce the economic loss caused by theft. Although many advanced works have been proposed, they cannot work properly in an open RFID system with unexpected tags. That is because the unexpected tags may reply to the reader when it is the missing tags’ turn, such that the replies are mistakenly treated as the missing tags’, leading to failure to detect the missing tags. To solve the problem, this article proposes an order-based missing tag identification protocol (OMTI) that efficiently identifies all missing tags even with the presence of unexpected tags. The key of OMTI is that we dynamically assign each tag an exclusive slot rather than use random hashes in traditional design. Namely, OMTI off-line serializes all known tags in advance by assigning each of them a unique and continuous slot, on-line identifies missing tags by checking tags’ responses in each slot, and dynamically updates the slot assignment to ensure the high efficiency of the next execution. Besides, we enhance OMTI to make it embrace newly added tags and spread to the multi-reader case from the single one. The simulation results demonstrate that OMTI can significantly reduce the identification time compared to the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Pervasiveness of wireless networks drives the heterogeneity and density of devices in a vast diversity of environments. To achieve high reliability and low energy consumption while enabling pervasiveness is inherently a resource allocation problem. In low-rate wireless personal area networks, multi-frequency time-division multiple access methods are identified as compelling solutions to resource allocation via scheduling transmissions in time and frequency. This work presents the TREE (TRaffic-aware Energy Efficient) algorithm, an adaptive and distributed scheduling algorithm, designed to provide high reliability in terms of packet reception ratio while optimizing the energy consumption of each device. This algorithm schedules communications according to the packets in the queue and short-memory performance. Decisions are made locally, and low-interference scheduling emerges at the network level. TREE is an adaptive threshold-based model that allocates more network resources (e.g., timeslots) when the communication queue size crosses a threshold and frees resources if the resource was underutilized. Implemented over IEEE-802.15.4-TSCH and extensively tested in simulation and on real deployments up to 81 devices, the algorithm is compared to MSF, Alice, and Orchestra, the state of the art in time-slotted channel hopping scheduling. Results highlight a high reliability regarding packet reception ratio and a lower energy consumption compared to the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring disturbances and malicious attacks can lead to faults in synchronizing the clocks of two network nodes. In this article, we investigate the fundamental resilience bounds of network clock synchronization for a system of N nodes against the peer-to-peer synchronization faults. Our analysis is based on practical synchronization algorithms with time complexity down to O ( N 3 ) that attempt to correct the faults by checking the consistency among the following three types of data: (1) the estimated faults, (2) the estimated clock offsets among the nodes, and (3) the measured clock offsets from the potentially faulty peer-to-peer synchronization sessions. Our analysis gives the following three major results. First, the maximum number of faults that can be corrected by the algorithms has a tight bound of ⌊ N /2 ⌋ − 1 when every node pair performs a synchronization session. Second, by converting the fault resilience problem to a graph-theoretic edge connectivity problem and applying Menger’s theorem, we develop an algorithm to compute the tight bound when not every node pair performs a synchronization session. Third, the number of synchronization sessions to achieve the capability of correcting any K faults has a lower bound of ⌈ N (2 K +1) / 2 ⌉ ; we also develop an algorithm to schedule the synchronization sessions to approach the lower bound. The above results provide basic understanding and useful guidelines to the design of resilient clock synchronization systems. For instance, our results suggest that, the four-node network achieves the highest degree of resilience that is defined as the ratio of the maximum number of correctable faults to the number of synchronization sessions. Therefore, by organizing a large-scale clock synchronization system into a hierarchy of multiple tiers with each consisting of four-node synchronization groups, we can achieve satisfactory and understood resilience against faults with reduced synchronization sessions.",

Many efficient CTC protocols have been proposed to demonstrate its promise in IoT applications. However, the applications built upon CTC will be significantly impaired when CTC suffers from malicious attacks such as jamming or sniffing. In this article, we implement a reactive jamming system, JamCloak, that can attack most existing CTC protocols. To this end, we first propose a taxonomy of the existing CTC protocols. Then based on the taxonomy, we extract essential features to train a CTC detection model, and estimate the parameters that can efficiently jam CTC links. Experimental results show that JamCloak consistently achieves 94.7% of classification accuracy on average in both Line-of-Sight and Non-Line-of-Sight scenarios. We also apply JamCloak to attack three existing CTC protocols: WiZig, Esense and EMF. Results show that JamCloak can significantly reduce PDR (packet delivery ratio) by 80.8% on average in practical environments. In the meantime, JamCloak’s jamming gain is more than 1.78× higher than the existing reactive jammer. In addition, we propose a practical countermeasure against reactive jamming attacks over CTC links like JamCloak. Results show that our approach significantly improves the jamming detection accuracy by 91.2% on average than the existing approach, and effectively decreases the reduction in packet delivery ratio to 1.7%.",

We claim that IoT devices need detailed descriptions of their behaviour to achieve secure default configurations, sufficient security configurability, and self-configurability.

Then, we describe how devices interact within S×C4IoT and how our framework manages the dynamic evolution that naturally result from IoT devices life-cycles. Furthermore, we show that S×C4IoT can allow legacy S×C-noncompliant devices to participate with an S×C network, we illustrate two different integration approaches, and we show how they fit into S×C4IoT. Last, we implement the framework as a proof-of-concept.

While the CTC links are complex and dynamic, how to estimate the quality of a CTC link remains an open and challenging problem. Through our observation and study, we find that none of the existing approaches can be applied to estimate the link quality of CTC. Built upon the physical-level emulation, transmission over a CTC link is jointly affected by two factors: the emulation error and the channel distortion. Furthermore, the channel distortion can be modeled and observed through the signal strength and the noise strength. We, in this article, propose a new link metric called C-LQI and a joint link model that simultaneously takes into account the emulation error and the channel distortion in the In-phase and Quadrature ( IQ ) domain. We accurately describe the superimposed impact on the received signal. We further design a lightweight link estimation approach including two different methods to estimate C-LQI and in turn the packet reception rate ( PRR ) over the CTC link. We implement C-LQI and compare it with two representative link estimation approaches. The results demonstrate that C-LQI reduces the relative estimation error by 49.8% and 51.5% compared with s-PRR and EWMA, respectively.",

Acoustic communication is best suited for underwater communication, with much lower attenuation than RF, but acoustic propagation is five orders-of-magnitude slower than RF, so propagation times stretch to hundreds of milliseconds. Low-power wakeup tones are present in new underwater acoustic modems, and when added to applications and MAC protocols they reduce energy consumption wasted on idle listening. Unfortunately, underwater acoustic tones suffer from self-multipath —echoes unique to the latency that can completely defeat their protocol advantages. We introduce Self-Reflection Tone Learning (SRTL), a novel approach where nodes use Bayesian techniques to address interference by learning to discriminate self-reflections from noise and independent communication. We present detailed experiments using an acoustic modem in controlled and uncontrolled, in-air and underwater environments. These experiments demonstrate that SRTL's knowledge corresponds to physical-world predictions, that it can cope with underwater noise and reasonable levels of artificial noise, and that it can track a changing multipath environment. Simulations confirm that these real-world experiments generalize over a wide range of conditions.",

    "abstract": "False data filtering schemes are designed to filter out false data injected by malicious sensors; they keep the network immune to bogus event reports. Theoretic understanding of false data filtering schemes and guidelines to further improve their designs are still lacking. This article first presents an information-theoretic model of false data filtering schemes. From the information-theoretic view, we define the scheme's filtering capacity C F i as the uncertainty-reduction ratio of the target input variable, given the output. This metric not only performs better than existing metrics but also implies that only by optimizing the false negative rate and false positive rate simultaneously, can we promote a scheme's overall performance. Based on the investigation from the modeling efforts, we propose HiFi , a hybrid authentication-based false data filtering scheme. HiFi leverages the benefits of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography and achieves a high filtering capacity, as well as low computation and communication overhead. Performance analysis demonstrates that our proposed metric is rational and useful, and that HiFi is effective and energy efficient.",

Furthermore, security issues are also becoming key features due to their impact on system behavior. As a consequence, new design frameworks are required to enable developers to model and address security risks from the very beginning of the WSN design process, while optimizing system performance. For this purpose, this article presents a design framework for modeling and simulating WSNs under external attacks. In this framework, the WSN is specified by using UML/MARTE models, from which automatic code generation enables fast, host-compiled simulation. The resulting information enables early detection of weaknesses in WSN designs and simplifies further exploration of design solutions. Minor modifications in the UML models are sufficient to automatically simulate and evaluate each design alternative in an iterative way. As a result, designers can develop more secure and optimized WSN systems with reduced design times and effort.",

To achieve this, new and intelligent wireless spectrum allocation strategies are required not only to avoid interference, but also to make best-use of the limited available spectrum. This article presents a new spectrum allocation scheme referred to as Smart Channel Assignment (SCA), which maximizes the resource usage and transmission speed by deploying a partially-orthogonal channel assignment scheme between coexisting WBANs as well as offering a convenient tradeoff among spectral reuse efficiency, transmission rate, and outage. Detailed analytical studies verify that the proposed SCA strategy is robust to variations in channel conditions, increase in sensor node-density within each WBAN, and an increase in number of coexisting WBANs.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been used for many long-term monitoring applications with the strip topology that is ubiquitous in the real-world deployment, such as pipeline monitoring, water quality monitoring, vehicle monitoring, and Great Wall monitoring. The efficiency of routing strategy has been playing a key role in serving such monitoring applications. In this article, we first present a robust geographic opportunistic routing (GOR) approach—LIght Propagation Selection (LIPS)—that can provide a short path with low energy consumption, communication overhead, and packet loss. To overcome the complication caused by the multi-turning point structure, we propose the virtual Plane mirror (VPM) algorithm, inspired by the light propagation, which is to map the strip topology into the straight one logically. We then select partial neighbors as the candidates to avoid blindly involving all next-hop neighbors and ensure the data transmission along the correct direction. Two implementation problems of VPM—transmission spread angle and the communication range—are thoroughly analyzed based on the percolation theory. Based on the preceding candidate selection algorithms, we propose a GOR algorithm in the strip topology network. By theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, we illustrate the validity and higher transmission performance of LIPS in strip WSNs. In addition, we have proved that the length of the path in LIPS is two times the length of the shortest path via geometrical analysis. Simulation results show that the transmission success rate of our approach is 26.37% higher than the state-of-the-art approach, and the communication overhead and energy consumption rate are 33.11% and 40.23% lower, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the requirement of heterogeneity in the Internet of Things, we initiate the joint study of capacity and energy efficiency scaling laws in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, and so on. The whole network is composed of n nodes scattered in a square region with side length L = n α , and there are m = n ν home points { c j } j=1 m , where a generic home point c j generates q j nodes independently according to a stationary and rotationally invariant kernel k ( c j , ⋅). Among the n nodes, we schedule n s independent multicast sessions each consisting of k − 1 destination nodes and one source node. According to the heterogeneity of nodes’ distribution, we classify the network into two regimes: a cluster-dense regime and a cluster-sparse regime. For the cluster-dense regime, we construct single layer highway system using percolation theory and then build the multicast spanning tree for each multicast session. This scheme yields the Ω( n ½+(α − ½)γ / n s √ k ) per-session multicast capacity. For the cluster-sparse regime, we partition the whole network plane into several layers and construct nested highway systems. The similar multicast spanning tree yields the Ω( n ½−(1− ν)γ/2 / n s √ k ) per-session multicast capacity, where γ is the power attenuation factor. Interestingly, we find that the bottleneck of multicast capacity attributes to the network region with largest node density, which provides a guideline for the deployment of sensor nodes in large-scale sensor networks. We further analyze the upper bound of multicast capacity and the per-session multicast energy efficiency. Using both synthetic networks and real-world networks (i.e., Greenorbs), we evaluate the asymptotic capacity and energy efficiency and find that the theoretical scaling laws are gracefully supported by the simulation results. To our best knowledge, this is the first work verifying the scaling laws using real-world large-scale sensor network data.",

However, single radio technology can hardly deliver optimal performance across all critical quality of service (QoS) dimensions under the typically varying environmental conditions or under varying distance between communicating nodes. Using a single wireless technology therefore falls short of meeting the demands of varying workloads or changing environmental conditions. Instead of pursuing a one-radio-fits-all approach, we design ARTPoS , an Adaptive Radio and Transmission Power Selection system, which makes available at runtime multiple wireless technologies (e.g., WiFi and ZigBee) and selects the radio(s) and transmission power(s) most suitable for the current conditions and requirements. The principal components of ARTPoS include new empirical models of power consumption and packet reception ratio (the latter can also be refined online) and online optimization schemes. We have implemented our system and evaluate it on the physical testbed consisting of our new embedded platforms with heterogeneous radios. Experimental results show that ARTPoS can significantly reduce the power consumption, while maintaining desired link reliability, compared to standard baselines.",

A crucial problem is to maximize the profit of the platform, i.e., the charge of a sensing task minus the payments to participants that execute the task. In this article, we improve the profit via the data reconstruction method, which brings new challenges, because it is hard to predict the reconstruction quality due to the dynamic features and mobility of participants. In particular, two Profit-driven Online Participant Selection (POPS) problems under different situations are studied in our work: (1) for S-POPS, the sensing cost of the different parts within the target area is the Same. Two mechanisms are designed to tackle this problem, including the ProSC and ProSC+. An exponential-based quality estimation method and a repetitive cross-validation algorithm are combined in the former mechanism, and the spatial distribution of selected participants are further discussed in the latter mechanism; (2) for V-POPS, the sensing cost of different parts within the target area is Various, which makes it the NP-hard problem. A heuristic mechanism called ProSCx is proposed to solve this problem, where the searching space is narrowed and both the participant quantity and distribution are optimized in each slot. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations based on the real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed mechanisms are more effective and efficient than baselines, selecting the participants with a larger profit for the platform.",

This is likely because our tools lag behind the rest of the computing field. As a remedy, we present a new framework that enables modern unit testing techniques in sensornets. Although the framework takes a holistic approach to unit testing, its novelty lies mainly in two aspects. First, to boost test development, it introduces embedded mock modules that automatically abstract out dependencies of tested code. Second, to automate test assessment, it provides embedded code coverage tools that identify untested control flow paths in the code. We demonstrate that in sensornets these features pose unique problems, solving which requires dedicated support from the compiler and operating system. However, the solutions have the potential to offer substantial benefits. In particular, they reduce the unit test development effort by a few factors compared to existing solutions. At the same time, they facilitate obtaining full code coverage, compared to merely 57--72% that can be achieved with integration tests. They also allow for intercepting and reporting many classes of runtime failures, thereby simplifying the diagnosis of software flaws.

    "abstract": "Broadcast is a critical communication primitive in wireless sensor networks. The multihop nature of sensor networks makes it necessary for sensor nodes to forward broadcast messages so that the messages can reach an entire network. Authentication of broadcast messages is an important but challenging problem in sensor networks. Public key cryptography (PKC) has been used recently to address this problem. However, PKC-based authentication techniques are susceptible to bogus packet insertion attacks in which attackers keep broadcasting bogus messages and force resource-constrained sensor nodes to forward such messages. Moreover, because it takes time to do signature verifications, it is impractical for each node to authenticate every received message before forwarding it. In this article, we propose a dynamic window scheme to thwart the aforementioned bogus packet insertion attacks which permits sensor nodes to efficiently broadcast messages. Within this scheme, a sensor node has the ability to determine whether or not to verify an incoming message before forwarding the message. We further study the property of this dynamic window scheme and investigate the best strategy for thwarting bogus packet insertion attacks. We propose three strategies for finding the optimal parameters by an improved additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) window updating function so that the proposed dynamic window scheme can achieve the best overall performance with respect to the authentication and forwarding times of messages. Numerical validations show that our proposed scheme performs very well in terms of energy saving and broadcast delays based on three different metrics, including average authentication delays, the percentage of nodes receiving fake messages, and the percentage of nodes forwarding fake messages.",

    "abstract": "Energy efficiency dominates practically every aspect of the design of a wireless sensor network and duty cycling is an important tool for achieving high energy efficiencies. Duty cycling for wireless camera networks meant for tracking objects is made complex by the nodes having to anticipate the arrival of the objects in their field-of-view. The consequences of an object arriving in the view-region of a camera when it is sleeping need no elaboration. Our work presents a predictive framework to provide nodes with an ability to anticipate the arrival of objects in the field-of-view of their cameras. Our predictive framework differs from others in that the nodes whose duty cycles are increased are at least one step removed from the immediate neighborhood of the nodes where the objects are currently visible. By eliminating the need for the currently busiest nodes to also be in charge of informing their nonbusy immediate neighbors to get ready for object arrival, we end up with a more robust strategy for updating the duty cycle at the nodes where the objects are highly likely to appear soon. The proposed scheme works by using an existing MAC header bit that is already in the 802.15.4 protocol and, in that sense, our anticipatory approach for notifying the nodes about the current state of the object location entails no additional expenditure of energy.

In the scheme, each pair of communicating nodes shares pairwise symmetric keys and changes them at every transmission using a set of hashing functions. This article examines security aspects of the protocol. The most important issue is to ensure that it is infeasible for an adversary to restrict exhaustive key search to a subset of the keyspace. This desirable property holds if, after a small number of random key transitions, the distribution of keys among the nodes is close to uniform. The article provides a rigorous mathematical analysis of the distribution of keys and supplements it with experimental results. The problem is reduced to the question of determining mixing time and the stationary distribution of a random walk on a random digraph. It is shown that with probability close to 1, the mixing time is of small order and the fluctuations of the distribution are limited. This ensures the ongoing security of the protocol by making the communications forward secure and protecting against node compromise.",

    "abstract": "In traditional routing, the routing tables store shortest paths to all other destinations and have size linear in the size of the network, which is not scalable for resource-constrained networks such as wireless sensor networks. In this article we show that by storing selectively a much smaller set of routing paths in the routing tables one can get low-stretch, compact routing schemes. Our routing scheme includes an approximate distance oracle with which one can obtain approximate shortest path length estimates to destinations. This distance oracle can be obtained, for example, by a landmark-based scheme, or in case of sensor networks, from the geographic distance between node locations. With an approximate distance oracle one can attempt greedy routing by forwarding to the neighbor whose estimate is closer to the destination. But there is no guarantee of delivery nor of the routing path length. We augment the distance oracle by storing, for each node u , routing paths to O (log 2 n ) strategically selected nodes that serve as intermediate destinations. These nodes are selected with probability proportional to 1/ r ρ , where r is the distance to u and ρ is a suitable constant for the network. Then we derive a set of sufficient conditions to select the next step at each stage of routing, such that these conditions can be verified locally and guarantee 1+ε stretch routing on any metric. These conditions serve as the “greedy routing” or local decision rule. On graphs of bounded growth, our scheme guarantees 1+ε stretch routing with high probability, with an average routing table size of O (√n log 2 n ). This scheme is favorable for its simplicity, generality, and blindness to any global state. It demonstrates that global routing properties could emerge from purely distributed and uncoordinated routing table design.",

    "abstract": "In geographical forwarding of packets in a large wireless sensor network (WSN) with sleep-wake cycling nodes, we are interested in the local decision problem faced by a node that has “custody” of a packet and has to choose one among a set of next-hop relay nodes to forward the packet toward the sink. Each relay is associated with a “reward” that summarizes the benefit of forwarding the packet through that relay. We seek a solution to this local problem, the idea being that such a solution, if adopted by every node, could provide a reasonable heuristic for the end-to-end forwarding problem. Toward this end, we propose a local &lt;i&gt;relay selection problem&lt;/i&gt; consisting of a forwarding node and a collection of relay nodes, with the relays waking up sequentially at random times. At each relay wake-up instant, the forwarder can choose to &lt;i&gt;probe&lt;/i&gt; a relay to learn its reward value, based on which the forwarder can then decide whether to &lt;i&gt;stop&lt;/i&gt; (and forward its packet to the chosen relay) or to &lt;i&gt;continue&lt;/i&gt; to wait for further relays to wake up. The forwarder’s objective is to select a relay so as to minimize a combination of waiting delay, reward, and probing cost. The local decision problem can be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem studied in the operations research literature. We formulate the local problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and characterize the solution in terms of &lt;i&gt;stopping sets&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;probing sets&lt;/i&gt;. We provide results illustrating the structure of the stopping sets, namely, the (lower bound) threshold and the stage independence properties. Regarding the probing sets, we make an interesting conjecture that these sets are characterized by upper bounds. Through simulation experiments, we provide valuable insights into the performance of the optimal local forwarding and its use as an end-to-end forwarding heuristic.",

    "abstract": "The rapid popularization of mobile devices makes it more convenient and cost-efficient to collect synchronized WiFi received signal strength (RSS) and inertial measurement unit sequences by crowdsensing. The transition model has proven to be a promising unsupervised localization approach that captures the transition relationship between the change of RSS signal space and the change of physical space, alleviating the need of extra knowledge for creating radio map. However, it faces two essential challenges in real-world deployments. First, model coverage affects its locating performance, because a specific transition model only represents its local space. Second, the instability of RSS leads to a conflicting relationship between changes of two spaces because of the complex environment and the heterogeneous type of devices. To address these challenges, we propose Lightgbm-CTMM, a novel unsupervised localization framework. First, a clustering method is adopted to capture the expected relationship to ensure robust coverage. Second, direction filter is employed to guarantee that the change in signal space corresponds to the change in physical space. The feasibility and effectiveness of Lightgbm-CTMM are evaluated by extensive experiments, and the locating performance of Lightgbm-CTMM is better than that of conventional approaches. Moreover, Lightgbm-CTMM reduces the work on quality assessment of trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Telecommunications systems with Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) structure using Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation (OFDM) have great potential for efficient application to a network of Internet of Things (IoT) at a high data rate. When the IoT network is among the underwater sensory devices known as the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), the electromagnetic wave cannot play the role of baseband signal due to rapid fall-off inside the water. Thus, acoustic OFDM is a reliable replacement for conventional OFDM inside the water. A blind structure for MIMO acoustic OFDM using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) brings even further advantages in data rate and energy consumption by avoiding the required pilot and preamble data. This research work presents a blind MIMO Acoustic OFDM blind transceiver for IoUT based on Probabilistic Stone’s Blind Source Separation (PS-BSS). The proposed technique has multiple times lower complexity compared to the ICA-based technique while maintaining a comparable efficiency. As observed in the results carried out with 100 Monte Carlo runs of transmission of random data bits over a highly sparse channel that is the common case of an underwater environment, the proposed PS-BSS-based technique dominates the ICA-based one, and as the sparseness of the channel decreases, its efficiency is comparable to the ICA-based technique. Thus, in the case of a highly sparse channel, the proposed technique is superior in both aspects of efficiency and complexity, while over lower sparseness, due to its comparative efficiency, it can be hired as an optimum technique fulfilling a fair tradeoff between efficiency and complexity.",

We define the algorithm, describe the simulation testbed, and present performance evaluation in several scenarios, including real-life topologies of IoT networks.

Travel times of certain road segments explicitly reflect the traffic conditions of those sections. Effective TTP of road segments is instrumental in route planning, traffic control, and traffic management. However, the accuracy of TTP is greatly affected by the intricate topological structure of traffic network and the dynamics of traffic flow over time. This paper develops a TTP method based on the spatial-feature-based hierarchical clustering (SFHC) and deep multi-input gated recurrent unit (DMGRU) . The proposed two-stage method is capable of capturing the spatial-temporal features of traffic network. Specifically, the SFHC divides the road segments into several clusters having similar traffic features, and then the clustered data is fed into the DMGRU for TTP. Our experiments conducted on the practical dataset demonstrate that the designed prediction method can achieve the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.3109% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.5658, which outperform various combinations of baseline clustering algorithms and prediction models.",

However, R2B communication is not suitable for large-scale backscatter networks, since R2B cannot support parallel and long-range communication between the gateway and hundreds of R2B devices. In this article, we present Chipnet, a network that supports hundreds of long-range and concurrent connections between the gateway and multiple processor-free devices. The high-level design of Chipnet includes a parallel frequency-division uplink mechanism that can work on processor-free devices and a processor-free MAC layer protocol that supports gateway to broadcast downlink data and individually manage each processor-free device. This design addresses practical issues facing the processor-free device architecture, such as synchronizing hundreds of processor-free devices, assigning unique channel frequencies to every device, and realizing power-efficient processor-free signal conversion. The results demonstrate that a Chipnet network can achieve a task throughput of 2,400 tasks/s with a latency of 72.23 ms. Compared with the R2B network, Chipnet achieves 3×–5× improvements in network coverage range and two orders of magnitude improvement in both network throughput and network latency.",

    "abstract": "Long communication range and low energy consumption are the two most important design goals of Low-power Wide-area Networks (LPWANs); however, many prior works have revealed that the performance of LPWAN in practical scenarios is not satisfactory. Although there are PHY-layer and link-layer approaches proposed to improve the performance of LPWAN, they either rely heavily on the hardware modifications or suffer from low data recovery capability, especially with bursty packet loss patterns. In this article, we propose a practical system, eLoRa, for COTS devices. eLoRa utilizes rateless codes and joint decoding with multiple gateways to extend the communication range and lifetime of LoRaWAN. To further improve the performance of LoRaWAN, eLoRa optimizes parameters of the PHY-layer (e.g., spreading factor) and the link layer (e.g, block length). We implement eLoRa on COTS LoRa devices and conduct extensive experiments on an outdoor testbed to evaluate the effectiveness of eLoRa. Results show that eLoRa can effectively improve the communication range of DaRe and LoRaWAN by 43.2% and 55.7% with a packet reception ratio higher than 60%, and increase the expected lifetime of DaRe and LoRaWAN by 18.3% and 46.6%.",

Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy and the traditional wisdom often hosts these computation-intensive models in powerful cloud centers. However, the cloud-only approaches put significant computational pressure on cloud servers and increase the latency in heavy-load scenarios. Moreover, existing work often adopts RNN structures to model behaviors that suffer from low processing speed for under-utilization of parallel devices such as GPUs. In this work, we propose an efficient internet behavior-based recommendation framework with edge-cloud collaboration on deep CNNs (CoRec) to improve both the accuracy and speed for mobile recommendation. A novel convolutional interest network (CIN) improves the accuracy by modeling the long- and short-term interests and accelerates the prediction through parallel-friendly convolutions. To further improve the serving throughput and latency, a novel device-cloud collaboration strategy reduces workloads by pre-computing and caching long-term interests in the cloud offline and real-time computation of short-term interests in devices. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CoRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and has achieved at least an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput compared to cloud-only RNN-based approaches for long behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed rapid adoption of low-power Wireless Sensor-Actuator Networks (WSANs) in process industries. To meet the critical demand for reliable and real-time communication in harsh industrial environments, the industrial WSAN standards make a set of specific design choices, such as employing the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) technique. Such design choices distinguish industrial WSANs from traditional Wireless Sensor Networks, which were designed for best-effort services. Recently, there has been increasing interest in developing new methods to enable autonomous transmission scheduling for industrial WSANs that run TSCH and the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). Our study shows that the current approaches fail to consider the traffic loads of different devices when assigning time slots and channels, which significantly compromises network performance when facing high data rates. In this article, we introduce a novel Autonomous Traffic-Aware transmission scheduling method for industrial WSANs. The device that runs ATRIA can detect its traffic load based on its local routing information and then schedule its transmissions accordingly without the need to exchange information with neighboring devices. Experimental results show that ATRIA provides significantly higher end-to-end network reliability and lower end-to-end latency without introducing additional overhead compared with a state-of-the-art baseline.",

However, even though the camera’s traffic is encrypted, attackers can still infer what the residents are doing at home. Although this security loophole has been reported, it does not attract much attention from the public, as it requires the attacker to be in close proximity to the camera and have some prior knowledge about the victims. Due to these requirements, the attacker has a low chance of success in the real world. In this article, we argue that the capability of attackers has been greatly underestimated. First, the attacker can leverage the characteristics of video transport protocols to recover the metadata of missing packets. Second, the attacker can build the inference model using the public datasets and adapt the model to the real traffic. Thus, the attacker can launch the attack at a distance from the camera, without prior knowledge about the victim. We also implement this attack scenario and verify that the attacker can infer the victims’ activities at a distance as large as 40 m without any knowledge about the victim, neither personal nor environmental.",

    "abstract": "The rising demand for utilizing fine-grained data in deep-learning (DL) based intelligent systems presents challenges for the collection and transmission abilities of real-world devices. Deep compressive sensing, which employs deep learning algorithms to compress signals at the sensing stage and reconstruct them with high quality at the receiving stage, provides a state-of-the-art solution for the problem of large-scale fine-grained data. However, recent works have proven that fatal security flaws exist in current deep learning methods and such instability is universal for DL-based image reconstruction methods. In this article, we assess the security risks introduced by deep compressive sensing in the widely used computer vision system in the face of adversarial example attacks and poisoning attacks. To implement the security inspection in an unbiased and complete manner, we develop a comprehensive methodology and a set of evaluation metrics to manage all potential combinations of attack methods, datasets (application scenarios), categories of deep compressive sensing models, and image classifiers. The results demonstrate that deep compressive sensing models unknown to adversaries can protect the computer vision system from adversarial example attacks and poisoning attacks, whereas the ones exposed to adversaries can cause the system to become more vulnerable.",

    "abstract": "Optical wireless communication (OWC) shows great potential due to its broad spectrum and the exceptional intensity switching speed of LEDs. Under poor conditions, most OWC systems switch from complex and more error prone high-order modulation schemes to more robust On-Off Keying (OOK) modulation defined in the IEEE OWC standard. This paper presents LiFOD, a high-speed indoor OOK-based OWC system with fine-grained dimming support. While ensuring fine-grained dimming, LiFOD remarkably achieves robust communication at up to 400 Kbps at a distance of 6 meters. This is the first time that the data rate has improved via OWC dimming in comparison to the previous approaches that consider trading off dimming and communication. LiFOD makes two key technical contributions. First, LiFOD utilizes Compensation Symbols (CS) as a reliable side-channel to represent bit patterns dynamically and improve throughput. We firstly design greedy-based bit pattern mining. Then we propose 2D feature enhancement via YOLO model for real-time bit pattern mining. Second, LiFOD synchronously redesigns optical symbols and CS relocation schemes for fine-grained dimming and robust decoding. Experiments on low-cost Beaglebone prototypes with commercial LED lamps and the photodiode (PD) demonstrate that LiFOD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art system with 2.1× throughput on the SIGCOMM17 data-trace.",

    "abstract": "Predicting future traffic conditions from urban sensor data is crucial for smart city applications. Recent traffic forecasting methods are derived from Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks (STGCNs). Despite their remarkable achievements, these spatio-temporal models have mainly been evaluated on small-scale datasets. In light of the rapid growth of the Internet of Things and urbanization, cities are witnessing an increased deployment of sensors, resulting in the collection of extensive sensor data to provide more accurate insights into citywide traffic dynamics. Spatio-temporal graph modeling on large-scale traffic data is challenging due to the memory constraint of the computing device. For traffic forecasting, subgraph sampling from road networks onto multiple devices is feasible. Many GCN sampling methods have been proposed recently. However, combining these with STGCNs degrades performance. This is primarily due to prediction biases introduced by each sampled subgraph, which analyze traffic states from a regional perspective. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a parallel STGCN framework called PaSTG. PaSTG divides the road network into regions, each processed by an individual STGCN in a device. To mitigate regional biases, Aggregation Blocks in PaSTG merge spatial-temporal features from each STBlock. This collaboration enhances traffic forecasting. Furthermore, PaSTG implements pipeline parallelism and employs a graph partition algorithm for optimized pipeline efficiency. We evaluate PaSTG on various STGCNs using three traffic datasets on multiple GPUs. Results demonstrate that our parallel approach applies widely to diverse STGCN models, surpassing existing GCN samplers by up to 57.4% in prediction accuracy. Additionally, the parallel framework achieves speedups of up to 2.87x and 4.70x in training and inference compared to GCN samplers.",

    "abstract": "Accurate localization is one of the basic requirements for smart cities and smart factories. In wireless cellular network localization, the straight-line propagation of electromagnetic waves between base stations and users is called line-of-sight (LOS) wireless propagation. In some cases, electromagnetic wave signals cannot propagate in a straight line due to obstruction by buildings or trees, and these scenarios are usually called non-LOS (NLOS) wireless propagation. Traditional localization algorithms such as TDOA, AOA, etc. , are based on LOS channels, which are no longer applicable in environments where NLOS propagation is dominant, and in most scenarios, the number of base stations with LOS channels containing users is often small, resulting in traditional localization algorithms being unable to satisfy the accuracy demand of high-precision localization. In addition, some nonideal factors may be included in the actual system, all of which can lead to localization accuracy degradation. Therefore, the approach developed in this paper uses knowledge graph and graph neural network (GNN) technology to model communication data as knowledge graphs, and it adopts the knowledge graph inference technique based on a heterogeneous graph attention mechanism to infer unknown data representations in complex scenarios based on the known data and the relationships between the data to achieve high-precision localization in scenarios with LOS/NLOS channel coexistence. We experimentally demonstrate a spatial 2D localization accuracy level of approximately 10 meters on multiple datasets and find that our proposed algorithm has higher accuracy and stronger robustness than the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

Configuring an industrial WSAN to meet the application-specified quality of service (QoS) requirements is a complex process, which involves theoretical computation, simulation, and field testing, among other tasks. Since industrial wireless networks become increasingly hierarchical, heterogeneous, and complex, many research efforts have been made to apply wireless simulations and advanced machine learning techniques for network configuration. Unfortunately, our study shows that the network configuration model generated by the state-of-the-art method decays quickly over time. To address this issue, we develop a ME ta-learning based R untime A daptation (MERA) method that efficiently adapts network configuration models for industrial WSANs at runtime. Under MERA, the parameters of the network configuration model are explicitly trained such that a small number of optimization steps with only a few new measurements will produce good generalization performance after the network condition changes. We also develop a data sampling method to reduce the measurements required by MERA at runtime without sacrificing its performance. Experimental results show that MERA achieves higher prediction accuracy with less physical measurements, less computation time, and longer adaptation intervals compared to a state-of-the-art baseline.",

However, existing BS-based approaches totally neglect the inherent interaction effect between BS factor, video bitrate and environment context. Their combined impact on user’s visual perception in mobile scenario, leading to inharmonious between energy consumption and user’s quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose PEO , a novel user- P erception-based video E xperience O ptimization for energy-constrained mobile video streaming, by jointly considering the inherent connection between a device’s state of motion, video quality and the resulting user-perceived quality. Specifically, by capturing the motion of the on-the-run device, PEO first infers the optimal bitrate and BS factor, therefore avoiding bitrate-inefficiency for energy saving while guaranteeing the user-perceived QoE. On that basis, we formulate the device motion-aware and user perception-aware video streaming as an optimization problem where we present an optimal algorithm to maximize the object function and adapt to user preference, and thus propose an online bitrate selection algorithm. Our evaluation (based on trace analysis and user study) shows that, compared with state-of-the-art techniques, PEO can raise the perceived quality by 23.8%-41.3% and save up to 25.2% energy consumption.",

In light of this, we propose a self-supervised framework with contrastive learning for robust EEG-based emotion recognition, which can effectively leverage both readily available unlabeled EEG signals and labeled ones to learn highly discriminative EEG features. Firstly, we construct a specific pretext task according to the sequential non-stationarity of emotional EEG signals for contrastive learning, which aims at extracting pseudo-label information from all EEG data. Meanwhile, we propose a novel negative segment selection algorithm to reduce the noise of unlabeled data during the contrastive learning process. Secondly, to mitigate the overfitting issue induced by a small number of labeled samples during learning, we originate a loss function with label smoothing regularization that can guide the model to learn generalizable features. Extensive experiments over three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model on EEG-based emotion recognition task.

We developed an amplitude stabilization algorithm which uses envelope detection to reduce the impact of high-frequency movement on the signal, and uses dynamic threshold output to lower the BER in backscatter demodulation. Our method reduces the BER by 0.3757 compared to the regular demodulation method, resulting in a final BER of 0.07.

The attitude angle estimation’s mean error is under 7 degrees. The system’s accuracy in detecting the target object’s trajectory is as high as 99%, and it can still decode with a bit error rate of no more than 0.034 at a speed of 166 cm/s.

Event camera, a new vision sensor, holds the potential to enable drones to overcome the above challenging scenarios if fused into the image-based SLAM. Unfortunately, the computational demands of event-image fusion SLAM have grown manifold compared to image-based SLAM.

This scheme can be widely deployed on most appliances in home environments. We propose a novel two-stage locating approach based on acoustic sensing to capture the signal variation of the user’s face and separate the face region echoes from multipath interferences in the distance dimension. To obtain distinguishable facial features, we design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based feature extractor. In addition, the acoustic signal is highly susceptible to different changes in practical authentication. To overcome it, we utilize a transfer learning technique with little training overhead to enable SoundFace resilient to various authentication changes. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SoundFace achieves an average true authentication rate of over 96.2% and an equal error rate of 4.2%, and it is robust to various real-world settings.",

We find that this problem can be resolved by learning the classifier across multiple time-scales. We propose a multi-scale, cascaded recurrent neural network architecture, MSC-RNN, composed of an efficient multi-instance learning (MIL) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for clutter discrimination at a lower tier and a more complex RNN classifier for source classification at the upper tier. By controlling the invocation of the upper RNN with the help of the lower tier conditionally, MSC-RNN achieves an overall accuracy of 0.972. Our approach holistically improves the accuracy and per-class recalls over machine learning models suitable for radar inferencing.

    "abstract": "Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) is a popular distributed problem-solving paradigm that harnesses the power of mobile workers (e.g., smartphone users) to perform location-based tasks (e.g., checking product placement or taking landmark photos). Typically, a worker needs to travel physically to the target location to finish the assigned task. Hence, the worker’s familiarity level on the target location directly influences the completion quality of the task. In addition, from the perspective of the SC server, it is desirable to finish all tasks with a low recruitment cost. Combining these issues, we propose a Bi-Objective Task Planning (BOTP) problem in SC, where the server makes a task assignment and schedule for the workers to jointly optimize the workers’ familiarity levels on the locations of assigned tasks and the total cost of worker recruitment. The BOTP problem is proved to be NP-hard and thus intractable. To solve this challenging problem, we propose two algorithms: a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on the constraint method and a heuristic algorithm based on the multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm. The extensive evaluations on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Location information is of essential importance in sensor networks deployed for generating location-specific event reports. When such networks operate in hostile environments, it becomes imperative to guarantee the correctness of event location claims. In this article we address the problem of assessing location claims of untrusted (potentially compromised) nodes. The mechanisms introduced here prevent a compromised node from generating illicit event reports for locations other than its own. This is important because by compromising “easy target” sensors (say, sensors on the perimeter of the field that's easier to access), the adversary should not be able to impact data flows associated with other (“premium target”) regions of the network. To achieve this goal, in a process we call location certification , data routed through the network is “tagged” by participating nodes with “belief” ratings, collaboratively assessing the probability that the claimed source location is indeed correct. The effectiveness of our solution relies on the joint knowledge of participating nodes to assess the truthfulness of claimed locations. By collaboratively generating and propagating a set of “belief” ratings with transmitted data and event reports, the network allows authorized parties (e.g., final data sinks) to evaluate a metric of trust for the claimed location of such reports. Belief ratings are derived from a data model of observed past routing activity. The solution is shown to feature a strong ability to detect false location claims and compromised nodes. For example, incorrect claims as small as 2 hops (from the actual location) are detected with over 90% accuracy. Finally, these new location certification mechanisms can be deployed in tandem with traditional secure localization, yet do not require it, and, in a sense, can serve to minimize the need thereof.",

    "abstract": "Most work in sensor networks tries to maximize network lifetime. However, for many applications the required lifetime is known in advance. Therefore, application quality should rather be maximized for that given time. Levels , the approach presented in this article, is a programming abstraction for energy-aware sensor network applications that helps to meet such a user-defined lifetime goal by deactivating optional functionality. With this programming abstraction, the application developer defines so-called energy levels . Functionality in energy levels is deactivated if the required lifetime cannot be met otherwise. The runtime system uses data about the energy consumption of different levels to compute an optimal level assignment that maximizes each node's quality for the time remaining. As described in this paper, Levels includes a completely distributed coordination algorithm that balances energy level assignments and keeps the application quality of the network roughly constant over time. In this approach, each node computes its schedule based on those of its neighbors. As the evaluation shows, applications using Levels can accurately meet given lifetime goals with only small fluctuations in application quality. In addition, the runtime overhead both for computation and for communication is negligible.",

The algorithm is compared qualitatively and quantitatively to multiple previous approaches. Various models and network settings are considered in extensive simulations.

    "abstract": "Sensor networks have particularly important applications in challenging environments. However, those challenging environments also pose significant challenges to network sustainability and reliability. In such environments, the network often becomes disruptive and even unavailable during downtime. This results in undesired loss of valuable spatial-temporal sensor data. Data persistence can be achieved by using in-situ encoding and caching of data through distributed mechanisms. However, the existing methods in the literature are mainly based on network random walks, which not only incur significant communication overhead, but also are prone to network or node failures. In this article, we present ECPC , a distributed E rasure C oding with randomized P ower C ontrol protocol for preserving data in disruptive sensor networks. ECPC only requires each sensor node to perform several rounds of broadcast in its neighborhood at some randomly chosen radio transmission power levels, and thus it incurs low communication overhead. We proved that ECPC achieves the expected code degree distribution and pseudo-global randomness of erasure coding principles. We have also evaluated the performance of ECPC by comparing it with several key related approaches in the literature (such as EDFC and RCDS). The performance comparisons validate that our proposed ECPC protocol can reach higher data reliability under varying node failure probabilities. In addition, ECPC protocol is also shown to be scalable with different network sizes.",

To date, discovery schemes trade a long latency for energy efficiency and require a collaborative duty cycle pattern, and thus they are not suitable for interactive mobile applications where a user is unable to configure others’ devices. In this article, we propose Acc , which serves as an on-demand generic discovery accelerating middleware for many deterministic neighbor discovery schemes. Acc leverages the discovery capabilities of neighbor devices, supporting both direct and indirect neighbor discoveries. Further, we present a proactive online rendezvous maintenance mechanism, which is used to reduce delays for the detection of leaving of neighbors. Our evaluations show that Acc -assisted discovery schemes reduce latency by up to 51.8% compared to schemes consuming the same amount of energy. More importantly, to prove the real-world value of Acc , we further present and evaluate a Crowd-Alert application where Acc is employed by taxi drivers to accelerate selection of a direction with fewer competing taxis and more potential passengers, based on a 280GB dataset of more than 14,000 taxis in Shenzhen, the most crowded city in China.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are characterized by localized interactions , that is, protocols are often based on message exchanges within a node’s direct radio range. We recognize that for these protocols to work effectively, nodes must have consistent information about their shared neighborhoods. Different types of faults, however, can affect this information, severely impacting a protocol’s performance. We factor this problem out of existing WSN protocols and argue that a notion of neighborhood view consistency (NVC) can be embedded within existing designs to improve their performance. To this end, we study the problem from both a theoretical and a system perspective. We prove that the problem cannot be solved in an asynchronous system using any of Chandra and Toueg’s failure detectors. Because of this, we introduce a new software device called pseudocrash failure detector (PCD), study its properties, and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for solving NVC with PCDs. We prove that, in the presence of transient faults, NVC is impossible to solve with any PCDs, thus define two weaker specifications of the problem. We develop a global algorithm that satisfies both specifications in the presence of unidirectional links, and a localized algorithm that solves the weakest specification in networks of bidirectional links. We implement the latter atop two different WSN operating systems, integrate our implementations with four different WSN protocols, and run extensive micro-benchmarks and full-stack experiments on a real 90-node WSN testbed. Our results show that the performance significantly improves for NVC-equipped protocols; for example, the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) halves energy consumption with higher data delivery.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic source localization has many important applications. Convex relaxation provides a viable approach of obtaining good estimates very efficiently. There are two popular convex relaxation methods using either semi-definite programming (SDP) or second-order cone programming (SOCP). However, the performances of the methods have not been studied properly in the literature and there is no comparison in terms of accuracy and performance. The aims of this article are twofold. First of all, we study and compare several convex relaxation methods. We demonstrate, by numerical examples, that most of the convex relaxation methods cannot localize the source exactly, even in the performance limit when the time difference of arrival (TDOA) information is exact. In addressing this problem, we propose a novel mixed SDP-SOCP relaxation model and study the characteristics of the optimal solutions and its localizable region. Furthermore, an error correction scheme for the proposed SDP-SOCP model is developed so that exact localization can be achieved in the performance limit. Experimental data have been collected in a room with two different array configurations to demonstrate our proposed approach.",

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based mobile edge computing systems is widely used in Ag-IoT due to the low cost, fast movement and ease of operation of UAVs. Nevertheless, sensors in agriculture may be under a tall and dense crop canopy or under the soil where they have difficulty harvesting a steady of energy and have too worse a channel condition to transmit more data. This paper considers a UAV-Sensor Collaboration Wireless Network (USCWN) in which each UAV carries a computation module and a wireless power transfer module to provide service and energy to sensors. Then, we propose an online resource management framework with two sub-algorithms to maximize the network throughput of USCWN. The first is the sensor fuzzy selection algorithm, which determines which UAV the sensor transmits data to, considering the different resource properties between sensors and UAVs without prior knowledge. The other is a semi-distributed dynamic resource allocation algorithm in which the sensors compete with UAV’s energy, computation, and communication resources in a stochastic game. The UAV acts as a game manager to manage sensor resources. The stochastic game is solved using Lyapunov optimization, which yields a coarse correlated equilibrium that is better than the nash equilibrium. Performance evaluation shows that our proposed framework has a higher network throughput than other agricultural works and maintains stable sensor energy.",

One key contribution is to model the inherent correlation between millimeter-wave and audio signals.

Additionally, we elaborate on two novel modules for multi-modal fusion embedded into the neural network, leading to accurate speech recognition. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of Wavoice under adverse conditions—that is, the character recognition error rate below 1% in a range of 7 m. In terms of robustness and accuracy, Wavoice considerably outperforms existing audio-only speech recognition methods with lower character error and word error rates.",

    "abstract": "This article studies time-sensitive multicast in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with link uncertainty, where information from the source needs to be delivered to multiple receivers within an imposed delay constraint. Prior art on static WSNs minimizes the multicast delay via the construction of a multicast tree that approximates the Steiner tree in length, which, however, may be invalidated by the time-varying network topology of WSNs with uncertain link states. Moreover, for multicast in WSNs with link uncertainty, the possible link failure necessitates a suitable measurement of the uncertain communication distance and calls for the performance guarantee in both delay and delivery ratio. In this work, by modeling a WSN as a random graph with each link associated with a transmission probability, we propose FlowerCast, an efficient multicast scheme, to jointly minimize the expected multicast delay and to maximize the expected delivery ratio of multicast under delay constraint. The core of FlowerCast is to quantify the uncertain communication distance by the expected transmission delay of a time-varying path, based on which a delay-optimal multicast tree is constructed in accordance with the directionality of delay. Candidate paths with a high expected delivery ratio and low expected delay are then selected in a distributed manner to conditionally connect adjacent multicast members and thus transform the multicast tree into a multicast flower. Despite the NP-hardness of optimal candidate paths’ addition, the transformation with the highest expected delivery ratio of multicast under delay constraint can be guaranteed through a pseudo-polynomial time derandomization-based greedy approach. We further demonstrate the time and energy efficiency of FlowerCast through asymptotic analysis. To make full use of the possible overlapping links in a multicast flower, a hybrid routing strategy is presented to wisely switch between sequential routing and synchronous routing for extra enhancement of the multicast performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets verify the superiority of FlowerCast and hybrid routing over baselines and indicate their wide applicability to practical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Ranging-based localization is a fundamental problem in the Internet of Things and unmanned aerial vehicle networks. However, the nodes’ limited-ranging scope and users’ broad coverage purpose inevitably cause network sparsity or subnetwork sparsity. The performances of existing localization algorithms are extremely unsatisfactory in sparse networks. A crucial way to deal with the sparsity is to exploit the hidden knowledge provided by the unmeasured edges, which inspires this work to propose a hypothesis-based Joint Edge Inference and Localization algorithm called InferLoc . InferLoc mines the Unmeasured but Inferable Edges (UIEs). Each UIE is an unmeasured edge, but it is restricted through other edges in the network to be inside a rigid component, so it has only a limited number of possible lengths. We propose an efficient method to detect UIEs and geometric approaches to infer possible lengths for UIEs in 2D and 3D networks. The inferred possible lengths of UIEs are then treated as multiple hypotheses to determine the node locations and the lengths of UIEs simultaneously through a joint graph optimization process. In the joint graph optimization model, to make the 0/1 decision variables for hypotheses selection differentiable, differentiable functions are proposed to relax the 0/1 selections, and rounding is applied to select the final length after the optimization converges. We also prove the condition when a UIE can contribute to sparse localization. Extensive experiments show remarkably better accuracy and efficiency performances of InferLoc than the state-of-the-art network localization algorithms. In particular, it reduces the localization errors by more than 90% and speeds up the convergence time more than 100 times than that of the widely used G2O-based methods in sparse networks.",

    "abstract": "Object segmentation aims to perfectly identify objects embedded in the surrounding environment and has a wide range of applications. Most previous methods of object segmentation only use RGB images and ignore geometric information from disparity images. Making full use of heterogeneous data from different devices has proved to be a very effective strategy for improving segmentation performance. The key challenge of the multimodal fusion-based object segmentation task lies in the learning, transformation, and fusion of multimodal information. In this article, we focus on the transformation of disparity images and the fusion of multimodal features. We develop a multimodal fusion object segmentation framework, termed the Hybrid Fusion Segmentation Network (HFSNet). Specifically, HFSNet contains three key components, i.e., disparity convolutional sparse coding (DCSC), asymmetric dense projection feature aggregation (ADPFA), and multimodal feature fusion (MFF). The DCSC is designed based on convolutional sparse coding. It not only has better interpretability but also preserves the key geometric information of the object. ADPFA is designed to enhance texture and geometric information to fully exploit nonadjacent features. MFF is used to perform multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments show that our HFSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on two challenging datasets.",

    "abstract": "Connectivity restoration is essential for ensuring continuous operation in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, existing works lack enough network robustness when suffering from the secondary external damages. In this paper, we propose a novel connectivity restoration scheme to address this problem. This scheme comprises three connectivity mechanisms regarding relay segment selection in different regions. The first one is a data traffic decentralization mechanism, which establishes more transmission paths near the sink for reliability improvement and traffic load balancing. The second one is a segment shape selection mechanism, in which the segments with high-reliability preferably become the relay segments for greater network robustness. The third one is a traffic load transfer mechanism, in which data traffic is transferred from a high-load segment to a low-load segment for balancing energy depletion of the network. The distinctive characteristics of this work are twofold: different regions perform diverse connectivity restoration approaches according to the demand diversity of different regions, and traffic load can be balanced from upstream regions rather than only from downstream regions. Extensive simulation experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed scheme in terms of connection cost, network robustness, load balance degree, and network longevity.",

    "abstract": "The growing popularity of contact-free smart sensing has contributed to the development of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). The contact-free sensory data has great potential to mine and analyze the hidden information for AIoT-enabled applications. However, due to the limited storage resource of contact-free smart sensing devices, data is naturally stored in the cloud, which is at risk of privacy leakage. Cloud storage is generally considered insecure. On one hand, the openness of the cloud environment makes the data easy to be attacked, and the complex AIoT environment also makes the data transmission process vulnerable to the third party. On the other hand, the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is untrusted. In this article, to ensure the security of data from contact-free smart sensing devices, a Cloud-Edge-End cooperative storage scheme is proposed, which takes full advantage of the differences in the cloud, edge, and end. Firstly, the processed sensory data is stored separately in the three layers by utilizing well-designed data partitioning strategy. This scheme can increase the difficulty of privacy leakage in the transmission process and avoid internal and external attacks. Besides, the contact-free sensory data is highly time-dependent. Therefore, combined with the Cloud-Edge-End cooperation model, this article proposes a delta-based data update method and extends it into a hybrid update mode to improve the synchronization efficiency. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed cooperative storage method can resist various security threats in bad situations and outperform other update methods in synchronization efficiency, significantly reducing the synchronization overhead in AIoT.",

We use the model-agnostic meta-learning framework to adapt the anonymization model trained via federated learning to each user’s data distribution. We evaluate Blinder under different settings and show that it provides end-to-end privacy protection on two IMU datasets at the cost of increasing privacy loss by up to 4.00% and decreasing data utility by up to 4.24%, compared to the state-of-the-art anonymization model trained on centralized data. We also showcase Blinder’s ability to anonymize the radio frequency sensing modality. Our experiments confirm that Blinder can obscure multiple private attributes at once, and has sufficiently low power consumption and computational overhead for it to be deployed on edge devices and smartphones to perform real-time anonymization of sensor data.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative edge caching enables edge servers to jointly utilize their cache to store popular contents, thus drastically reducing the latency of content acquisition. One fundamental problem of cooperative caching is how to coordinate the cache replacement decisions at edge servers to meet users’ dynamic requirements and avoid caching redundant contents. Online deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising way to solve this problem by learning a cooperative cache replacement policy using continuous interactions (trial and error) with the environment. However, the sampling process of the interactions is usually expensive and time-consuming, thus hindering the practical deployment of online DRL-based methods. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Delay-awarE Cooperative cache replacement method based on Offline deep Reinforcement learning (DECOR), which can exploit the existing data at the mobile edge to train an effective policy while avoiding expensive data sampling in the environment. A specific convolutional neural network is also developed to improve the training efficiency and cache performance. Experimental results show that DECOR can learn a superior offline policy from a static dataset compared to an advanced online DRL-based method. Moreover, the learned offline policy outperforms the behavior policy used to collect the dataset by up to 35.9%.",

Recent CVS providers use different machine learning techniques to improve their services (regarded as tasks) based on the uploaded video. However, uploading data to the CVS providers may cause severe privacy issues. Existing works that remove privacy information could not achieve a high tradeoff between data usability and privacy, because the importance of information varies with the task. In addition, it is challenging to design a real-time privacy protection mechanism, especially in resource-constrained smart cameras. In this work, we design a task-driven and efficient video privacy protection mechanism for a better tradeoff between privacy and data usability. We use Class Activation Mapping to protect privacy while preserving data usability. To improve the efficiency, we utilize the motion vector and residual matrix produced during video codec. Our work outperforms the region of interest–based methods in data protection while preserving data usability.

Such multi-user AR systems should be able to detect the human keypoints and estimate device poses (for identifying different users) in the meantime. However, due to the stringent low latency requirements and the intensive computation of the preceding two capabilities, previous research only enables either of the two capabilities for mobile devices even with the aid of the edge server. Integrating the two capabilities is promising but non-trivial in terms of latency, accuracy, and matching. To fill this gap, we propose DiTing to achieve real-time ID-aware multi-device visual interaction for multi-user AR applications, which contains three key innovations: Shared On-device Tracking to merge the similar computation for optimized latency, Tightly Coupled Dual Pipeline to enhance the accuracy of each task through mutual assistance, and Body Affinity Particle Filter to precisely match device poses with human bodies. We implement DiTing on four types of mobile AR devices and develop a multi-user AR game as a case study. Extensive experiments show that DiTing can provide high-quality human keypoint detection and pose estimation in real time (30fps) for ID-aware multi-device interaction and outperform the state-of-the-art baseline approaches.",

Consequently, assessing muscle activation is important for both excelling in exercise, athletics, and professional sports in general. Existing techniques for assessing muscle activation, such as electromyography, are invasive, requiring needles inserted directly into the muscle or electrodes that have considerable placement requirements (shaving, gels, etc.). This makes them unsuitable for active environments. In addition, factors such as body motion noise that results from the high-impact movements encountered in active sports environments easily corrupt sensor data. This compounds the unsuitability of these systems in the sports and exercise arena. As a result, such systems have been explored mostly in clinical rather than sports-based scenarios. We present MyoVibe, a system for sensing and determining muscle activation in high-mobility, high-impact exercise scenarios. MyoVibe senses and interprets multiple muscle vibration signals obtained from a wearable network of accelerometers to determine muscle activation. By utilizing a diverse feature set combined with the simple yet effective motion artifact mitigation technique, MyoVibe can reduce inertial sensor noise in these high-mobility exercises.

There are two desired features of the algorithm: energy-efficiency and resilience. If the target is traveling through a high node density area, then an optimal sensor selection approach is employed that maximizes a joint cost function of remaining energy and geometric diversity around the targets position. This provides energy-efficiency and increases the network lifetime while preventing redundant nodes from tracking the target. On the other hand, if the target is traveling through a low node density area or in a coverage gap (e.g., formed by node failures or non-uniform node deployment), then a potential game is played amongst the surrounding nodes to optimally expand their sensing ranges via minimizing energy consumption and maximizing target coverage. This provides resilience, that is the self-healing capability to track the target in the presence of low node densities and coverage gaps. The algorithm is comparatively evaluated against existing approaches through Monte Carlo simulations which demonstrate its superiority in terms of tracking performance, network-resilience and network-lifetime.",

In this article, the energy-efficient dual-codebook based backscatter communications (DBBC) is proposed, which adopts two prefix codebooks shared by the sender and the receiver over a backscatter communication link. With the DBBC, the sender backscatters codewords from which the receiver decodes the original data.

Mapping a prefix codebook into a binary tree and performing pruning and expanding operation (PEO) on binary trees, we obtain the solution to the optimization problem, which includes the two energy-efficient codebooks and the other two key parameters for the DBBC.

However, existing work relies only on a small number of orthogonal channels, resulting in degraded performance when a large number of data flows need to be transmitted on different channels. In this article, we conduct empirical studies to investigate interferences among overlapping channels. Our results show that overlapping channels can also be utilized for improved real-time performance if the node transmission power is carefully configured. In order to minimize the overall transmission power consumption of a network with multiple data flows under end-to-end delay constraints, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to configure the transmission power level of every node and assign overlapping channels to different data flows. Since the optimization problem has an exponential computational complexity, we then present a heuristic algorithm designed based on simulated annealing to find a suboptimal solution. Our extensive empirical results on a 33-mote testbed demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better real-time performance and less power consumption than two baselines, including a scheme using only orthogonal channels.",

    "abstract": "Indoor proximity verification has become an increasingly useful primitive for the scenarios where access is granted to the previously unknown users when they enter a given area (e.g., a hotel room). Existing solutions either rely on homogeneous sensing modalities shared by two parties or require additional human interactions. In this article, we propose a context-based indoor proximity verification scheme, called SenCS, to enable real-time autonomous access for mobile devices, utilizing the available heterogeneous sensors at the user side and at the room side. The intuition is that only when the user is within a room can sensors from both sides observe the same events in the room. Yet such a solution is challenging, because the events may not provide enough entropy within the required time and the heterogeneity in sensing modalities may not always agree on the sensed events. To overcome the challenges, we exploit the time intervals between successively human actions to create heterogeneous contextual fingerprints (HCF) at a millisecond level. By comparing the contextual similarity between the HCF s from both the room and user sides, SenCS accomplishes the indoor proximity verification. Through proof-of-concept implementation and evaluations on 30 participants, SenCS achieves an accuracy of 99.77% and an equal error rate (EER) of 0.23% across various hardware configurations.",

The state of the art on CTC employs physical-level emulation. Due to the protocol incompatibility and the hardware restriction, there are intrinsic emulation errors between the emulated signals and the legitimate signals. Unresolved emulation errors hurt the reliability of CTC and the achievable throughput, but how to improve the reliability of CTC remains a challenging problem. Taking the CTC from WiFi to BLE as an example, this work first presents a comprehensive understanding of the emulation errors. We then propose WEB, a practical CTC approach that can be implemented with commercial devices. The core design of WEB is split encoding: based on the probabilistic distribution of emulation errors, the WiFi sender manipulates its payload to maximize the successful decoding rate at the BLE receiver. We implement WEB and evaluate its performance with extensive experiments. Compared to two existing approaches, WEBee and WIDE, WEB reduces the SER (Symbol Error Rate) by 54.6% and 42.2%, respectively. For the first time in the community, WEB achieves practically effective CTC from WiFi to BLE, with an average throughput of 522.2 Kbps.",

The main motivation is to address the yet poorly understood size variation-induced effect on power-aware buffering schemes. Our theoretical analysis elucidates the fundamental differences between the fixed-size and fixed-interval buffering schemes in the presence of data size variation. It shows that data size variation has detrimental effects on the power expenditure of the fixed-size buffering in general, and reveals that the size variation induced effects can be either mitigated by a positive skewness or promoted by a negative skewness in size distribution. By contrast, the fixed-interval buffering scheme has an obvious advantage of being eminently immune to the data-size variation. Hence the fixed-interval buffering scheme is a risk-averse strategy for its robustness in a variety of operational environments. In addition, based on the fixed-interval buffering scheme, we establish the power consumption relationship between child nodes and parent node in a static data collection tree, and give an in-depth analysis of the impact of child bandwidth distribution on parent's power consumption. This study is of practical significance: it sheds new light on the relationship among power consumption of buffering schemes, power parameters of radio module and memory bank, data arrival rate and data size variation, thereby providing well-informed guidance in determining an optimal buffer size (interval) to maximize the operational lifespan of sensor networks.",

    "abstract": "Virtual Coordinate System (VCS)-based routing provides a practical, efficient, and scalable means for point-to-point routing in wireless sensor networks. Several VCS-based routing protocols have been proposed in the last few years, all assuming that nodes behave correctly. However, many applications require deploying sensor networks in adversarial environments, making VCS-based routing protocols vulnerable to numerous attacks. In this article, we study the security of VCS-based routing protocols, with a focus on the unique component of VCS-based routing protocols, the virtual coordinate system. We first identify the security requirements of a correctly functioning VCS-based routing protocol and a set of novel attacks that can result in the violation of each of the identified requirements. The attacks target the underlying virtual coordinate system and can be mounted with low resources. However, they are epidemic in nature and are highly destructive to system performance. We then propose lightweight defense mechanisms designed specifically for resource-constrained sensor networks against each of the identified attacks. The proposed techniques require only local information on sensor nodes and take into account the unreliable nature of wireless links and network churn. Finally, we evaluate experimentally the impact of the attacks and the effectiveness of our defense mechanisms using a well-known VCS-based routing protocol, BVR. Our experiments show that the proposed techniques successfully mitigate all the identified attacks under a realistic link model and even at a high level of network churn.",

Hence, optimizing the charging schedule of MC is essential to maximize the network lifetime in WRSNs. The existing works only target the local optimization of network lifetime limited to MC’s subsequent charging round. The network lifetime has been normally reflected in a different metric that is not directly related to the final charging round period. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address the global maximization of network lifetime in WRSNs, which optimizes not only the subsequent charging round but all charging rounds over the entire network lifetime. Another uniqueness is the joint consideration of both the charging path and charging time optimization problems. As a solution, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA)-based global optimization scheme that considers all the possible charging rounds. The GA has a novel mutation operation that mutates gene sizes for representing charging schedules with a varying number of charging rounds. The experiment results show that our algorithm can extend the network lifetime by 35.1 times on average and 38.6 times in the best case compared to existing ones.",

However, establishing an IoT from scratch can be monetarily expensive, and leasing the existing sub-networks confronts the potentially dishonest behavior of service providers. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework of leasing edge IoT networks and analyze the influence of sub-network owners’ dishonest behavior on the network. We model the interaction between the edge user and the owners of sub-networks by a Stackelberg game with a unique equilibrium, jointly analyzing the pricing and data collection mechanisms. The Primal-dual Decomposition algorithm and its theoretical analyses are provided for the corresponding strategies of the edge user and sub-network owners. Evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in the leasing model can save data collection cost up to 53% compared with existing data collection strategies, and illustrate the difference in network performance compared with the game without dishonest owners.",

To achieve this goal, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), regarded as the critical component of the 6G system, will be widely deployed in large-scale non-urban areas such as mountain villages, forests, and oceans. To ensure the high efficiency and stability of WSNs without the support of ground facilities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to provide assistance for WSNs. Nevertheless, considering the limitations of both the mobility and communication capability of UAVs, the diversified communication demands pose huge challenges for UAV-aided WSNs in large-scale application scenarios, such as how to schedule the SNs served in each time slot, how to optimize their working parameters, and how to plan the UAV trajectory. Therefore, a joint user scheduling, power configuration, and trajectory planning strategy is proposed in this article, which is formulated as an optimization problem suffering from non-convexity and complication. The successive optimization scheme is adopted here to efficiently solve this problem, which divides the original problem into three sub-problems and solves them iteratively.

Recent proposals to improve the user–item interaction experience rely on special hardware, such as a smartphone-based RFID scanner. This work presents a promising approach to allowing each user to interact with a tagged item using only one passive tag, which is named the Tag Mutual Identification Interface (TagMii). TagMii requires a user to put one’s user tag in physical proximity with an item tag to express certain interactions between the user and item. The key idea behind TagMii is to utilize two experimental observations: (1) inductive coupling for detecting interaction events, and (2) channel similarity for determining the actual interacting tags. We implement TagMii using commodity off-the-shelf RFID devices and conduct experiments in complex environments with rich multipath, mobility, wireless signals, electrical devices, and magnetic fields. The results show that TagMii provides accurate mutual identification.

    "abstract": "In the agricultural sector, identifying plant diseases is crucial as they hamper the plant's robustness and health, which play a vital role in agricultural productivity. Early detection allows farmers to take proper measurements and save crops from complete failure. Biosensor applications in agricultural production and plant monitoring improve the yield through definitive recommendations and improved practices. Fluorescence-based assays, colorimetric biosensors, and surface plasmon resonance-based biosensors are the most commonly used for plant pathogen detection. Plant disease detection is a prime biosensor application for preventing seasonal and cultural defects in raising crops. The sensor data analysis ensures reliable processing for distinguishable features for identifying the disease, wherein discrete information is handled with error. This article introduces a Preemptive Classification using Discrete Data (PC-DD) technique to resolve this issue. This technique requires partial series through probabilistic data substitution to improve the analysis rate. In the analysis process, the classification is performed using random forest based on two combinations: series, difference, and probability. This probability is based on identical data observed through series probability classification in the previous iteration. The unidentical data is classified under difference that is used for individual classification. This process is progressive until the detection is performed, wherein the alterations are adaptable for different biosensor input data. Therefore, the proposed technique's performance is validated using the metrics detection accuracy, analysis ratio, analysis time, classifications, and difference factor.",

The study required that temperatures be measured along a 3 km study reach, across the channel, and into off-channel areas. To capture diel and seasonal fluctuations, sensors were sampled quarter-hourly for the full duration of the six-month juvenile salmon winter residency. This sampling duration required that nodes minimize power-use. We adopted event-based software on MSP430 micro-controllers with 433 MHz radio and minimized the networking duty-cycle. To address link failures, we included network storage. As the network lacked real-time clocks, data were timestamped at the destination. This, coupled with the storage, yielded timestamp inaccuracies, which we re-aligned using a novel algorithm. We collected over six months of temperature data from 35 sensors across seven nodes. Of the packets collected, we identified 21% as being incorrectly timestamped and were able to re-align 41% of these incorrectly timestamped packets. We collected temperature data through major floods, and the network uploaded data until the flood destroyed the sensors. The network met an important need in ecological sampling with ultra-low power (multi-year battery life) and low-throughput.",

In our solution, we use the extreme propagation technique and probabilistic counters. It allows us to find the approximation of the average of a set of measurements done by sensor network with arbitrary precision, controlled by two parameters.

It not only reduces the deployment and management cost of sensors but can also guarantee accurate and fault-tolerant data coverage for long-term use. We evaluate BuildSense using sensor measurements from two rammed-earth houses that were custom-designed for a challenging hot-arid climate so almost no artificial heating or cooling is required. We demonstrate that BuildSense can significantly reduce the cost of permanent physical sensors while still achieving fit-for-purpose accuracy, fault-tolerance, and stability. Overall, we were able to reduce the cost of a building sensor network by 60% to 80% by replacing physical sensors with virtual ones while still maintaining accuracy of ≤1.0°C and fault-tolerance of two or more predictors per virtual sensor.",

    "abstract": "By using a large number of antenna (sensor) elements at the receivers, massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) offers many benefits for 5G communication systems, such as a huge spectral efficiency gain, significant reduction of latency, and robustness to interference. However, to get these benefits of massive MIMO, accuracy of the channel state information obtained at the transmitter is required. This article proposes a approach for blind joint channel/symbols estimation in 3-D millimeter wave massive MIMO systems based on tensor factorization. More specifically, we suggest a direction-of-arrival (DOA)-based channel estimation method, which provides the best performance in terms of error bound for channel estimation. We show that the massive MIMO signals can be expressed as a third-order (3-D) tensor model, where the matrices of channel (2-D DOA) and symbols can be viewed as two independent factor matrices. Such a hybrid tensorial modeling enables a blind joint estimation of 2-D DOA/symbols. To learn the tensor model, we develop two least squares--based algorithms. The first one is delta bilinear alternating least squares (DBALS) algorithm that exploits the increment values between two iterations of the factor matrices to provide the initializations for such matrices. This avoids the slow convergence caused by random initializations for factor matrices found in the traditional least squares algorithms. The other one is Vandermonde constrained DBALS that takes into account the potential Vandermonde nature structure of the DOA matrix in the DBALS algorithm. This provides the estimation for the DOA matrix and gives a better uniqueness results for the use of tensor model. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by means of simulation results, and a comparison is made with the recent approaches. Besides a blind joint 2-D DOA/symbols estimation, our approach offers a better performance due to avoiding the random initializations and taking in the Vandermonde structure of DOA matrix.",

    "abstract": "Modern protocols for wireless sensor networks efficiently support multi-hop upward traffic from many sensors to a collection point, a key functionality enabling monitoring applications. However, the ever-evolving scenarios involving low-power wireless devices increasingly require support also for downward traffic, e.g., enabling a controller to issue actuation commands based on the monitored data. The IETF Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is among the few tackling both traffic patterns. Unfortunately, its support for downward traffic is significantly unreliable and inefficient compared to its upward counterpart. We tackle this problem by extending RPL with mechanisms inspired by opposed, yet complementary, principles. At one extreme, we retain the route-based operation of RPL and devise techniques allowed by the standard but commonly neglected by popular implementations. At the other extreme, we rely on flooding as the main networking primitive. Inspired by these principles, we define three base mechanisms, integrate them in a popular RPL implementation, analyze their individual and combined performance, and elicit the resulting tradeoffs in scalability, reliability, and energy consumption. The evaluation relies on simulation, using both real-world topologies from a smart city scenario and synthetic grid ones, as well as on testbed experiments validating our findings from simulation. Results show that the combination of all three mechanisms into a novel protocol, T-RPL (i) yields high reliability, close to the one of flooding, (ii) with a low energy consumption, similar to route-based approaches, and (iii) improves remarkably the scalability of RPL with respect to downward traffic.",

    "abstract": "Battery lifetime is one of the main challenges that impedes the deployment of energy-constrained wireless networks, such as unattended Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. To prolong battery lifetime, the duty-cycle mode is utilized in many IoT systems, especially in environment monitoring Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN). In duty-cycle mode, devices transmit packets during the active phase, which lasts for a short time, and sleeps the rest of the time. Prior research mainly focuses on energy efficiency in the active phase; energy consumption during the sleep phase, however, is always ignored, as it is assumed to have little margin to be optimized. In this work, we reveal that sleep phase can become a significant battery consumer due to the misconfiguration of General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins of micro-controllers. We propose OPCIO, which incorporates a genetic algorithm to obtain energy-efficient GPIO configurations automatically to squeeze the energy waste during the sleep phase. We prototype OPCIO on off-the-shelf devices and evaluate it on two ARM devices. Experiment results show that OPCIO can effectively find multiple low-power configurations that prolong the lifespans up to 10×.",

To address the inherent defects of false readings of RFID, we present RF-AMOC, a tag movement identification system that leverages the signal variation patterns between the opposite antennas and the tag to accurately determine whether someone takes the sensitive carrier out of the room or just the normal carrier usage activity in the room. Particularly, we focus on two kinds of signal variation modes: Direct side models, where the RSSI is sensed by one antenna on the tag side, and obstruction side models, where the RSSI is sensed by the other antenna that was obstructed by the person. Then, Pearson Coefficient and crest comparison algorithms are adopted to match the theoretical and actual RF-signal curves on the two sides, respectively. Additionally, a starting point acquisition method is proposed to extract the meaningful time period. A prototype of RF-AMOC is realized in two different environments with various persons, and the results validate that it is superior in terms of sensitivity and specificity with strong robustness.",

    "abstract": "Data aggregation based on machine learning (ML), in mobile edge computing, allows participants to send ephemeral parameter updates of local ML on their private data instead of the exact data to the untrusted aggregator. However, it still enables the untrusted aggregator to reconstruct participants’ private data, although parameter updates contain significantly less information than the private data. Existing work either incurs extremely high overhead or ignores malicious participants dropping out. The latest research deals with the dropouts with desirable cost, but it is vulnerable to malformed message attacks. To this end, we focus on the data aggregation based on ML in a practical setting where malicious participants may send malformed parameter updates to perturb the total parameter updates learned by the aggregator. Moreover, malicious participants may drop out and collude with other participants or the untrusted aggregator. In such a scenario, we propose a scheme named DAML , which to the best of our knowledge is the first attempt toward verifying participants’ submissions in data aggregation based on ML. The main idea is to validate participants’ submissions via SSVP, a novel secret-shared verification protocol, and then aggregate participants’ parameter updates using SDA, a secure data aggregation protocol. Simulation results demonstrate that DAML can protect participants’ data privacy with preferable overhead.",

The GLT distinguishes between a set of probability density function (pdf) families constructed using a custom pdf interpolation technique. The GLT is compared with the simple Likelihood Test (LT). We also adapt one prevalent supervised learning approach, Multiple Support Vector Machines (MSVMs), and compare it with our probabilistic methods. Due to the highly variant measurements from the wireless sensor nodes, and these methods' different adaptability to multiple observations, our analysis and experimental results suggest that GLT is more accurate and suitable for formation detection. The formation detection problem has interesting applications in posture detection with Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), which is extremely useful in health monitoring and rehabilitation.

In particular, we are interested in asymmetric power assignments so that the induced communication graph holds good distance and energy stretch factors simultaneously. In addition, we consider the following optimization objectives: low total energy consumption, low interference level, low hopdiameter, and high network lifetime. Two node deployment scenarios are studied: random and deterministic. For n random nodes distributed uniformly and independently in a unit square, we present several power assignments with varying construction-time complexities. The results are based on various geometric properties of random points and shortest path tree constructions. Due to the probabilistic nature of this scenario, the probability of our results converges to one as the number of network nodes, n , increases. For the deterministic case, we present two power assignments with nontrivial bounds. These are established in addition to shortcut edges that satisfy desired threshold stretch. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for spanner construction in wireless ad-hoc networks with provable bounds for both energy and distance metrics simultaneously. Our power assignments, in addition, try optimizing additional network properties, such as network lifetime, interference, and hop diameter.",

In this article, we propose a comprehensive approach to managed software evolution. Our approach has the following key features: (i) it supports divergent evolution of the WSAN's software, such that different nodes can evolve along different lines (e.g., to meet the needs of different stakeholders, or to address localized adaptations) and (ii) it supports both instructed and autonomous evolution such that nodes can be instructed to change their software configuration or can evolve their own configuration (e.g., to manage rapidly-changing environmental conditions where remote micromanagement would be infeasible due to the high latency of the WSAN environment). We present the four intra-WSAN protocols that comprise our solution, along with an accompanying server-side infrastructure, and evaluate our approach at scale.",

    "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a space filling curve (SFC) refers to a path passing through all nodes in the network, with each node visited at least once. By enforcing a linear order of the sensor nodes through an SFC, many applications in WSNs concerning serial operations on both sensor nodes and sensor data can be performed, with examples including serial data fusion and path planning of mobile nodes. Although a few studies have made efforts to find such SFCs in WSNs, they primarily target 2D planar or 3D surface settings and cannot be directly applied to 3D volumetric WSNs due to considerably more complex geometric features and topology shapes that the 3D volumetric settings introduce. This article presents BLOW-UP, a distributed, scalable, and connectivity-based algorithm to construct an SFC for a 3D volumetric WSN (or alternatively to linearize the 3D volumetric network). The main idea of BLOW-UP is to decompose the given 3D volumetric network into a series of connected and closed layers, and the nodes are traversed layer by layer, incrementally from the innermost to the outermost, yielding an SFC covering the entire network, provably at least once and at most a constant number of times. To the best of our knowledge, BLOW-UP is the first algorithm that realizes linearization in 3D volumetric WSNs. It does not require advance knowledge of location or distance information. It is also scalable with a nearly constant per-node storage cost and message cost. Extensive simulations under various networks demonstrate its effectiveness on nodes’ covered times, coverage rate, and covering speed.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in smartphone processing power have opened the possibilities for them to act as the processing component of software-defined radios (SDRs). For low-power sensor network systems using various communication protocols, this means that smartphones, when equipped with an SDR, can be their system management end-devices, (potentially) without the need for external communication modules. Nevertheless, the high processor and energy usage overhead of SDRs remains a major technical barrier that blocks the practical adoption of smartphone-based SDRs. In this work, we show that implementation flexibility at the software can relax this overhead. Specifically, we show, using an implementation of the low-power listening (LPL) Medium Access Control (MAC), that software improvements have the potential to significantly reduce the operational overhead of SDRs. Moreover, we show that implementing packet reception filters can help further reduce the performance overhead without sacrificing application-level message exchange qualities. Empirical results with a smartphone-based SDR suggest that by combining LPL with packet reception filters, the processing and energy overhead can be reduced by two to three orders of magnitude. We not only see this as a chance to practically realize smartphones as a wireless sensing system controller but also believe that the experiences with practical smartphone-based SDRs can provide guidelines for future wireless protocol and low-power radio designs that are suitable for mobile computing environments.",

A key challenge in such networks is to provide predictable performance and adaptability in response to link quality variations. We address this challenge by developing RECeiver ORiented Policies (Recorp), which leverages the stability of IIoT workloads by combining offline policy synthesis and run-time adaptation. Compared to schedules that service a single flow in a slot, Recorp policies share slots among multiple flows by assigning a coordinator and a list of flows that may be serviced in the same slot. At run-time, the coordinator will execute one of the flows depending on which flows the coordinator has already received. A salient feature of Recorp is that it provides predictable performance: a policy meets the end-to-end reliability and deadline of flows when the link quality exceeds a user-specified threshold.

    "abstract": "The geomagnetic field has been wildly advocated as an effective signal for fingerprint-based indoor localization due to its omnipresence and local distinctive features. Prior survey-based approaches to collect magnetic fingerprints often required surveyors to walk at constant speeds or rely on a meticulously calibrated pedometer (step counter) or manual training. This is inconvenient, error-prone, and not highly deployable in practice. To overcome that, we propose Maficon, a novel and efficient pedometer-free approach for geo ma gnetic fi ngerprint database con struction. In Maficon, a surveyor simply walks at casual (arbitrary) speed along the survey path to collect geomagnetic signals. By correlating the features of geomagnetic signals and accelerometer readings (user motions), Maficon adopts a self-learning approach and formulates a quadratic programming to accurately estimate the walking speed in each signal segment and label these segments with their physical locations. To the best of our knowledge, Maficon is the first piece of work on pedometer-free magnetic fingerprinting with casual walking speed. Extensive experiments show that Maficon significantly reduces walking speed estimation error (by more than 20%) and hence fingerprint error (by 35% in general) as compared with traditional and state-of-the-art schemes.",

    "abstract": "IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless sensor-actuator networks have been widely adopted by process industries in recent years because of their significant role in improving industrial efficiency and reducing operating costs. Today, industrial wireless sensor-actuator networks are becoming tremendously larger and more complex than before. However, a large, complex mesh network is hard to manage and inelastic to change once the network is deployed. In addition, flooding-based time synchronization and information dissemination introduce significant communication overhead to the network. More importantly, the deliveries of urgent and critical information such as emergency alarms suffer long delays, because those messages must go through the hop-by-hop transport. A promising solution to overcome those limitations is to enable the direct messaging from a long-range radio to an IEEE 802.15.4 radio. Then messages can be delivered to all field devices in a single-hop fashion. This article presents our study on enabling the cross-technology communication from LoRa to ZigBee using the energy emission of the LoRa radio as the carrier to deliver information. Experimental results show that our cross-technology communication approach provides reliable communication from LoRa to ZigBee with the throughput of up to 576.80 bps and the bit error rate of up to 5.23% in the 2.4 GHz band.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of smart devices, device authentication has received much attention. One popular method for device authentication is to utilize internally measured device fingerprints, such as device ID, software or hardware-based characteristics. In this article, we propose DeMiCPU , a stimulation-response-based device fingerprinting technique that relies on externally measured information, i.e., magnetic induction (MI) signals emitted from the CPU module that consists of the CPU chip and its affiliated power-supply circuits. The key insight of DeMiCPU is that hardware discrepancies essentially exist among CPU modules and thus the corresponding MI signals make promising device fingerprints, which are difficult to be modified or mimicked. We design a stimulation and a discrepancy extraction scheme and evaluate them with 90 mobile devices, including 70 laptops (among which 30 are of totally identical CPU and operating system) and 20 smartphones. The results show that DeMiCPU can achieve 99.7% precision and recall on average, and 99.8% precision and recall for the 30 identical devices, with a fingerprinting time of 0.6~s. The performance can be further improved to 99.9% with multi-round fingerprinting. In addition, we implement a prototype of DeMiCPU docker, which can effectively reduce the requirement of test points and enlarge the fingerprinting area.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the need for impromptu or as-you-go deployment of wireless sensor networks in some situations, we study the problem of optimal sequential deployment of wireless sensors and relays along a line (e.g., a forest trail) of unknown length. Starting from the sink node (e.g., a base station), a ”deployment agent„ walks along the line, stops at equally spaced points (”potential„ relay locations), placing relays at some of these points, until he reaches a location at which the source node (i.e., the sensor) needs to be placed, the objective being to create a multihop wireless relay network between the source and the sink. The deployment agent decides whether to place a relay or not at each of the potential locations, depending upon the link quality measurements to the previously placed relays. In this article, we seek to design efficient deployment algorithms for this class of problems, to achieve the objective of 2-connectivity in the deployed network. We ensure multi-connectivity by allowing each node to communicate with more than one neighbouring node. By proposing a network cost objective that is additive over the deployed relays, we formulate the relay placement problem as a Markov decision process. We provide structural results for the optimal policy and evaluate the performance of the optimal policy via numerical exploration. Computation of such an optimal deployment policy requires a statistical model for radio propagation; we extract this model from the raw data collected via measurements in a forestlike environment. To validate the results obtained from the numerical study, we provide an experimental study of algorithms for 2-connected network deployment.",

    "abstract": "Determining the location of a mobile user is central to several crowd-sensing applications. Using a Global Positioning System is not only power-hungry, but also unavailable in many locations. While there has been work on cellular-based localization, we consider an unexplored opportunity to improve location accuracy by combining cellular information across multiple mobile devices located near each other. For instance, this opportunity may arise in the context of public transport units having multiple travelers. Based on theoretical analysis and an extensive experimental study on several public transportation routes in two cities, we show that combining cellular information across nearby phones considerably improves location accuracy. Combining information across phones is especially useful when a phone has to use another phone’s fingerprint database, in a fingerprinting-based localization scheme. Both the median and 90 percentile errors reduce significantly. The location accuracy also improves irrespective of whether we combine information across phones connected to the same or different cellular operators. Sharing information across phones can raise privacy concerns. To address this, we have developed an id-free broadcast mechanism, using audio as a medium, to share information among mobile phones. We show that such communication can work effectively on smartphones, even in real-life, noisy-road conditions.",

Despite recent developments in irrigation control and sprinkler technology, state-of-the-art irrigation systems do nothing to compensate for areas of turf with heterogeneous water needs. In this work, we overcome the physical limitations of the traditional irrigation system with the development of a sprinkler node that can sense the local soil moisture, communicate wirelessly, and actuate its own sprinkler based on a centrally computed schedule. A model is then developed to compute moisture movement from runoff, absorption, and diffusion. Integrated with an optimization framework, optimal valve scheduling can be found for each sprinkler node in the space. In a turf area covering over 10,000ft 2 , two separate deployments with four weeks of fine-grained data collection show that DICTUM can reduce water consumption by 23.4% over traditional campus scheduling, and by 12.3% over state-of-the-art evapotranspiration systems while substantially improving conditions for plant health. In addition to environmental, social, and health benefits, DICTUM is shown to return its investment in 16 to 18 months based on water consumption alone.",

    "abstract": "This article presents Whisper, a fast and reliable protocol to flood small amounts of data into a multi-hop network. Whisper makes use of synchronous transmissions, a technique first introduced by the Glossy flooding protocol. In contrast to Glossy, Whisper does not let the radio switch from receive to transmit mode between messages. Instead, it makes nodes continuously transmit identical copies of the message and eliminates the gaps between subsequent transmissions. To this end, Whisper embeds the message to be flooded into a signaling packet that is composed of multiple packlets —where a packlet is a portion of the message payload that mimics the structure of an actual packet. A node must intercept only one of the packlets to detect that there is an ongoing transmission and that it should start forwarding the message. This allows Whisper to speed up the propagation of the flood and, thus, to reduce the overall radio-on time of the nodes. Our evaluation on the FlockLab testbed shows that Whisper achieves comparable reliability but 2× lower radio-on time than Glossy. We further show that by embedding Whisper in an existing data collection application, we can more than double the lifetime of the network.",

    "abstract": "Today's sensor network implementations often comprise various types of nodes connected with different types of networks. These and various other aspects influence the delay of transmitting data and therefore of out-of-order data occurrences. This turns into a crucial problem in time-sensitive applications where data must be processed promptly and decisions must be reliable. In this paper, we were researching dynamic buffer sizing algorithms for multiple, distributed and independent sources, which reorder event streams, thus enabling subsequent time-sensitive applications to work correctly. To be able to evaluate such algorithms, we had to record datasets first. Five novel dynamic buffer sizing algorithms were implemented and compared to state-of-the-art approaches in this domain. The evaluation has shown that the use of a dynamic time-out buffering method is preferable over a static buffer. The higher the variation of the network or other influences in the environment, the more necessary it becomes to use an algorithm which dynamically adapts its buffer size. These algorithms are universally applicable, easy to integrate in existing architectures, and particularly interesting for time-sensitive applications. Dynamic time-out buffering is still a trade-off between reaction time and out-of-order event compensation.",

We show, using a judicious combination of projective geometry, neural networks, and crowd-sourced annotations from human workers, that it is possible to, for example, localize 95% of the cameras in our test data set to within 12 m using a single image taken from the camera. This performance is an order of magnitude better than PoseNet, a state-of-the-art neural network that needs significantly more information than our approach, and can only estimate position and orientation (and not other properties).

To meet this critical need, we design and build AviSense, an SDR-based real-time , versatile system for monitoring aviation bands. AviSense detects and characterizes signal activities to enable practical and effective anomaly detection. We identify and tackle the challenges posed by a diverse set of critical aviation bands and technologies.

Billions of RFID tags have been deployed to locate daily objects such as equipment, pharmaceuticals, vehicles, and so on. Unlike previous solutions that focus on localizing tagged objects in the world coordinate system in reference to reader antennas, this work exploits a system, called RFCamera, that can identify and locate RFID-tagged objects in images with pixel dimensions. Our core insight is that an image is a visual AoA profile in terms of lights, which is resulted from the pinhole camera model. Similarly, we generate an RF image derived from the AoA profile of a tag using the same pinhole model as the camera. Consequently, the locations of visual entities corresponding to tagged objects are highlighted by comparing two types of images. To this end, we customized a camera system equipped with a pair of rotatable reader antennas. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that RFCamera enables a mean error of 5.7∘ and 2.9∘ at azimuth and elevation angle estimation, respectively. It can locate a visual entity with a mean error of 51 pixels (i.e., ≈1.3 cm at 96 dpi) in a 640× 480 image.",

    "abstract": "The broadcast nature of wireless media makes WLANs easily attacked by rogue Access Points (APs) . Rogue AP attacks can potentially cause severe privacy leakage and financial loss. Hardware fingerprinting is the state-of-the-art technology to detect rogue APs since an attacker would find it difficult to set up a rogue AP with specific hardware fingerprints. However, existing hardware fingerprints not only depend on the AP but also depend on the client, significantly limiting their application scenarios. In this work, we investigate two novel client-agnostic fingerprints, which can be extracted using commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices, to detect rogue APs. One is the power amplifier non-linearity fingerprint and the other is the frame interval distribution fingerprint . These two fingerprints remain consistent over time and space for the same AP but vary across different APs even with the same brand, model, and firmware. We use the fingerprint similarity between the candidate AP and the authorized AP for device authentication in typical indoor environments. We have also proposed a threshold-improved authentication scheme to improve the robustness of our system in dynamic environments. Our schemes can be implemented without modifying the infrastructural APs and can work well with new clients without rebuilding the fingerprint database. We evaluate our scheme in both in-lab and field scenarios, by analyzing 18 million WiFi packets. Results show that our scheme achieves an overall 96.55% positive detection rate and a 4.31% false alarm rate. Moreover, the threshold-improved authentication scheme can further reduce the false alarm rate by 13.0%-44.8% for dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved great and broad breakthroughs in many real-world applications. In particular, the task of training the network parameters has been masterly handled by back-propagation learning. However, the pursuit on optimal network structures remains largely an art of trial and error. This prompts some urgency to explore an architecture engineering process, collectively known as Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In general, NAS is a design software system for automating the search of effective neural architecture. This article proposes an X-learning NAS (XNAS) to automatically train a network’s structure and parameters. Our theoretical footing is built upon the subspace and correlation analyses between the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The design strategy hinges upon the underlying principle that the network should be coerced to learn how to structurally improvethe input/output correlation successively (i.e., layer by layer). It embraces both Progressive NAS (PNAS) and Regressive NAS (RNAS). For unsupervised RNAS, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a classic tool for subspace analyses. By further incorporating teacher’s guidance, PCA can be extended to Regression Component Analysis (RCA) to facilitate supervised NAS design. This allows the machine to extract components most critical to the targeted learning objective. We shall further extend the subspace analysis from multi-layer perceptrons to convolutional neural networks, via introduction of Convolutional-PCA (CPCA) or, more simply, Deep-PCA (DPCA). The supervised variant of DPCA will be named Deep-RCA (DRCA). The subspace analyses allow us to compute optimal eigenvectors (respectively, eigen-filters) and principal components (respectively, eigen-channels) for optimal NAS design of multi-layer perceptrons (respectively, convolutional neural networks). Based on the theoretical analysis, an X-learning paradigm is developed to jointly learn the structure and parameters of learning models. The objective is to reduce the network complexity while retaining (and sometimes improving) the performance. With carefully pre-selected baseline models, X-learning has shown great successes in numerous classification-type and/or regression-type applications. We have applied X-learning to the ImageNet datasets for classification and DIV2K for image enhancements. By applying X-learning to two types of baseline models, MobileNet and ResNet, both the low-power and high-performance application categories can be supported. Our simulations confirm that X-learning is by and large very competitive relative to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

To address this problem, existing transfer learning techniques require substantial target-domain data and incur high post-deployment overhead. Differently, we propose to exploit the first principle governing the domain shift to reduce the demand for target-domain data. Specifically, our proposed approach called PhyAug uses the first principle fitted with few labeled or unlabeled data pairs collected by the source sensor and the target sensor to transform the existing source-domain training data into the augmented target-domain data for calibrating the deep neural networks. In two audio sensing case studies of keyword spotting and automatic speech recognition, PhyAug recovers the recognition accuracy losses due to microphones’ characteristic variations by 37% to 72% with 5-second unlabeled data collected from the target microphones. In a case study of acoustics-based room recognition, PhyAug recovers the recognition accuracy loss caused by smartphone microphone variation by 33% to 80%. In the last case study of fisheye image recognition, PhyAug reduces the image recognition error due to the camera-induced distortions by 72%.",

In this article, we propose a device-free fall detection system, namely G-Fall, based on floor vibration collected by geophone sensors. We first decompose the falling mode and characterize it with time-dependent floor vibration features. By leveraging Hidden Markov Model (HMM), our system is able to detect the fall event precisely and achieve user-independent detection. It requires no training from the elderly but only an HMM template learned in advance through a small number of training samples. To reduce the false alarm rate, we propose a novel reconfirmation mechanism using Energy-of-Arrival (EoA) positioning to assist in detecting the human fall. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 24 human subjects. On average, G-Fall achieves a 95.74% detection precision on the anti-static floor and 97.36% on the concrete floor. Furthermore, with the assistance of EoA, the false alarm rate is reduced to nearly 0%.",

The collected data are always including sensitive information (sensitive data, users/devices/applications behaviors, etc.), which can be exchanged over the IoT to third-party for storing, processing, and sharing with associated applications. It is important to protect data privacy from compromising using consistently privacy preserving techniques. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving solution for both structured data and unstructured data by using data anonymization techniques, which are able to enhance privacy associated with IoT services, applications, and users/device behavior.

    "abstract": "Industrial cognitive radio sensor networks (ICRSNs) extend channel resources by occupying the vacant licensed channels in the absence of licensed users. In ICRSNs, industrial devices should switch to a common available channel to set up a communication link. However, channel switching leads to severe energy consumption. As the energy resources of battery-powered industrial devices are limited, it is crucial to carefully allocate channels to prolong the network lifetime of multi-hop ICRSNs. This paper is the first work that studies the channel allocation problem to optimize the network lifetime by considering the channel-switching (CS) energy consumption and the time-critical requirements of industrial applications. The problem is formulated to maximize the minimum residual energy at each round of data transmission, which is linearized as integer linear programming. As the channel allocation results will affect the residual energy at subsequent rounds, we propose a switching distance-optimized channel allocation (SDOCA) scheme that shortens the CS distances to improve the residual energy of each device. Moreover, we analyze the characteristics of SDOCA, i.e., convergent CS distance and guaranteed end-to-end delay. Extensive simulation results show that SDOCA can adaptively allocate channels according to the end-to-end delay requirement and significantly prolong the network lifetime.",

    "abstract": "With the broadening of the radio spectrum to higher frequency bands, wireless links are more prone to blockages by nomadic obstacles. However, existing routing schemes mostly follow the network-oriented design principle, which makes it difficult to react quickly to sudden obstruction. This article proposes PAR, a novel physical-assisted routing scheme for the Internet of Things. PAR takes a physical-oriented viewpoint attempting to mitigate unexpected link blockages by leveraging sensor observations of obstacles at individual nodes. It analyzes the signatures of sensor measurements to directly estimate the positions and sizes of obstacles and to proactively infer remedial routing decisions even before the transmission failure occurs. During the network deployment time, PAR lets each node learn and calibrate the geographic distribution of neighbors with respect to its sensor measurements by exchanging the sensor observations of a mobile guidance obstacle. During the runtime, an obstacle bypassing algorithm is then developed to find the shortest detour routes by comparing the local sensor measurements with the calibrated positions of neighbors to immediately resume data forwarding. We evaluate the efficacy of PAR using simulation and a real-world testbed. It is observed that PAR significantly improves the success rate while reducing redundant hops and routing control overhead.",

    "abstract": "The conventional approach for collecting data in sensor networks is the combination of automatic repeat-request techniques with a collection tree scheme in which all routes end up in the sink node. A high number of acknowledgments and retransmissions is the main drawback of this scheme. Erasure-correcting codes, in particular Fountain codes, can be employed to reduce the number of retransmissions. In the collection tree scheme, it is common for multiple routes to share a bottleneck. In such scenarios, to reach the optimal network throughput, it is necessary to combine the Fountain codes and Network Coding (NC) technique. Y-networks can be considered as an abstraction to this scenario. This article proposes a new algorithm, namely, Adaptive Distributed LT code (ADLT), for combining LT codes with NC in Y-networks. The ADLT algorithm enables belief propagation decoding by employing a novel technique called degree distribution updating, to preserve Robust Soliton degree distribution at destination. Unlike previously proposed algorithms in the literature, the ADLT algorithm has the flexibility to handle any number of sources with different block sizes and transmission rates, where sources perform standard LT coding. Simulation results confirm that the performance of the ADLT algorithm is close to that of standard LT code.",

    "abstract": "As wireless networks become more pervasive, the amount of the wireless data is rapidly increasing. One of the biggest challenges of wide adoption of distributed data storage is how to store these data securely. In this work, we study the frequency-based attack, a type of attack that is different from previously well-studied ones, that exploits additional adversary knowledge of domain values and/or their exact/approximate frequencies to crack the encrypted data. To cope with frequency-based attacks, the straightforward 1-to-1 substitution encryption functions are not sufficient. We propose a data encryption strategy based on 1-to- n substitution via dividing and emulating techniques to defend against the frequency-based attack, while enabling efficient query evaluation over encrypted data. We further develop two frameworks, incremental collection and clustered collection, which are used to defend against the global frequency-based attack when the knowledge of the global frequency in the network is not available. Built upon our basic encryption schemes, we derive two mechanisms, direct emulating and dual encryption, to handle updates on the data storage for energy-constrained sensor nodes and wireless devices. Our preliminary experiments with sensor nodes and extensive simulation results show that our data encryption strategy can achieve high security guarantee with low overhead.",

In contrast with recent works that hide bits in inaudible frequency bands, SoundSticker embeds hidden bits in the audible sounds, making them more reliably survive audio codecs and bandpass filtering, while achieving a higher data rate and remaining imperceptible to a listener. The key observation behind SoundSticker is that the human ear is less sensitive to the audio phase changes than the frequency and amplitude changes, which leaves us an opportunity to alter the phase of an audio clip to convey hidden information. We take advantage of this opportunity and build an OFDM-based physical layer. To make this PHY-layer design work for a variety of end devices with heterogeneous computation resources, SoundSticker addresses multiple technical challenges including perceivable waveform artifacts caused by the phase-based modulation, bit rate adaptation without channel sounding and real-time preamble detection. Our prototype on both smartphones and ESP32 platforms demonstrates SoundSticker’s superior performance against the state of the arts, while preserving excellent sound quality and remaining unaffected by common audio codecs like MP3 and AAC.

    "abstract": "On-demand delivery has become an increasingly popular urban service in recent years as it facilitates citizens’ daily lives significantly. In the fulfillment cycle, the order preparation time estimation is extremely important and can be used for many applications, such as improving order dispatching and fulfillment time estimation. Existing work is generally based on high-cost physical devices or large-scale labeled training data, which are not feasible in on-demand delivery services. We solve this problem based on already collected different kinds of data from the on-demand delivery platform, e.g., the courier’s reported arrival time to the merchant. Our intuition is that the couriers’ reported time implicitly reflects the order preparation time, which leads to a challenge: complicated correlations between the couriers’ reported arrival time and the order preparation time. To solve this challenge, we design an order preparation time inference framework OPTI, which first constructs a self-supervised classification task based on the couriers’ reported arrival time to infer the coarse-grained order preparation time and then exploits semi-supervised learning to transfer the coarse-grained time to fine-grained time inference. Experimental results show that OPTI can improve the accuracy of inference by 5% to 17% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of Internet-of-Things–enabled sensors, it is important to have effective methods to query the sensors. For example, in a dense network of battery-driven temperature sensors, it is often possible to query (sample) only a subset of the sensors at any given time, since the values of the non-sampled sensors can be estimated from the sampled values. If we can divide the set of sensors into disjoint so-called representative sampling subsets, in which each represents all the other sensors sufficiently well, then we can alternate between the sampling subsets and, thus, increase the battery life significantly of the sensor network. In this article, we formulate the problem of finding representative sampling subsets as a graph problem on a so-called sensor graph with the sensors as nodes. Our proposed solution, SubGraphSample, consists of two phases. In Phase-I, we create edges in the similarity graph based on the similarities between the time-series of sensor values, analyzing six different techniques based on proven time-series similarity metrics. In Phase-II, we propose six different sampling techniques to find the maximum number of representative sampling subsets. Finally, we propose AutoSubGraphSample, which auto-selects the best technique for Phase-I and Phase-II for a given dataset. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that AutoSubGraphSample can yield significant battery-life improvements within realistic error bounds.",

Most existing ultrasound-based gesture recognition tasks rely on a large amount of manually labeled samples to learn task-specific representations via end-to-end training. However, they cannot exploit unlabeled continuous gesture signals that are easy to collect. Inspired by recent self-supervised learning techniques, UltraCLR aims to autonomously learn a ubiquitous gesture signal representation that can benefit all tasks from low-cost unlabeled signals. We use the STFT heatmap as a secondary input and leverage the contrastive learning framework to improve the high-quality Channel Impulsive Response heatmap input representations. The learned representations can better represent the spatial-position information and intermediate states of gesture movement. With the representation learned by UltraCLR, we can greatly reduce the complexity of downstream gesture recognition tasks so that they can be completed using a simple classifier trained with a small training set and a lower computational cost. Our experimental results show that UltraCLR outperforms state-of-the-art gesture recognition systems with only a few labeled samples and achieves more than 85% reduction in computational complexity and over 9× improvement in inference speed.",

Autonomously adjusting the position of sensors for optimal coverage and monitoring of regions of interest (e.g., oil spill zones, chemical contamination areas) in real time is a significant challenge. To this end, this article proposes a hunting-style underwater sensor deployment based on the level set method. This method uses a gateway-like role to calculate the boundary and other parameters of the interest region based on an energy function used for positioning sensors. Subsequently, the sensors use these parameters as the basis to complete their migration toward the boundary of the interest region. This sensor migration can gradually evolve into a hunting deployment for the interest region. This article also proposes two novel performance evaluation metrics–structural similarity and network energy balance–to evaluate the comprehensive performance of the proposed hunting-style deployment of underwater sensors.

    "abstract": "With the easy access to mobile networks and the proliferation of video applications, video traffic is occupying a great portion of the network traffic, which poses a new challenge of how to alleviate the heavy backhaul traffic and ensure the high quality of experience for video services. As a promising solution towards addressing this challenge, video caching in edge networks has recently received significant attention, which mostly considers the video popularity and the user preference for the video. However, few studies consider the user behavior and the user preference for different parts of the video that indeed have an essential impact on caching efficiency. Hence, this article proposes a new caching and resource scheduling scheme for adaptive bitrate videos by incorporating these fine-grained factors. We first model the video service problem as a nonlinear integer programming problem, which can be divided into a cache placement problem and an online resource scheduling problem. Then, we design efficient algorithms based on several techniques, including greedy strategy, relaxation, and rounding, to solve the two problems. Extensive experimental results based on two real-world datasets show that the proposed solution achieves superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art caching approaches.",

    "abstract": "We aim to preserve a large amount of data generated inside base station-less sensor networks (BSNs) while considering that sensor nodes are selfish. BSNs refer to emerging sensing applications deployed in challenging and inhospitable environments (e.g., underwater exploration); as such, there do not exist data-collecting base stations in the BSN to collect the data. Consequently, the generated data has to be stored inside the BSN before uploading opportunities become available. Our goal is to preserve the data inside the BSN with minimum energy cost by incentivizing the storage- and energy-constrained sensor nodes to participate in the data preservation process. We refer to the problem as DPP: d ata p reservation p roblem in the BSN. Previous research assumes that all the sensor nodes are cooperative and that sensors have infinite battery power and design a minimum-cost flow-based data preservation solution. However, in a distributed setting and under different control, the resource-constrained sensor nodes could behave selfishly only to conserve their resources and maximize their benefit. In this article, we first solve DPP by designing an integer linear programming (ILP)-based optimal solution without considering selfishness. We then establish a game-theoretical framework that achieves provably truthful and optimal data preservation in BSNs. For a special case of DPP wherein nodes are not energy-constrained, referred to as DPP-W, we design a data preservation game DPG-1 that integrates algorithmic mechanism design (AMD) and a more efficient minimum cost flow-based data preservation solution. We show that DPG-1 yields dominant strategies for sensor nodes and delivers truthful and optimal data preservation. For the general case of DPP (wherein nodes are energy-constrained), however, DPG-1 fails to achieve truthful and optimal data preservation. Utilizing packet-level flow observation of sensor node behaviors computed by minimum cost flow and ILP, we uncover the cause of the failure of the DPG-1. It is due to the packet dropping by the selfish nodes that manipulate the AMD technique. We then design a data preservation game DPG-2 for DPP that traces and punishes manipulative nodes in the BSN. We show that DPG-2 delivers dominant strategies for truth-telling nodes and achieves provably optimal data preservation with cheat-proof guarantees. Via extensive simulations under different network parameters and dynamics, we show that our games achieve system-wide data preservation solutions with optimal energy cost while enforcing truth-telling of sensor nodes about their private cost types. One salient feature of our work is its integrated game theory and network flows approach. With the observation of flow level sensor node behaviors provided by the network flows, our proposed games can synthesize “microscopic” (i.e., selfish and local) behaviors of sensor nodes and yield targeted “macroscopic” (i.e., optimal and global) network performance of data preservation in the BSN.",

Recently, solar cells have also been used as sensors for context awareness sensing due to their sensitivity to varying lighting conditions. In this article, we are the first to use solar cells for symmetric key generation. To generate symmetric keys, we take advantage of photovoltage measurements generated from solar cells equipped with a pair of IoT devices. Symmetric keys are essential for pairing IoT devices and further securing wireless communication. Despite the sensitivity to varying lighting conditions, challenges still remain for the use of solar cells for key generation, such as time unsynchronisation and noisy measurements. To solve these challenges, we design a novel key generation framework, SolarKey, which includes the starting point detection and a compressed sensing-based two-tier key reconciliation method. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed key generation method in various environments, which shows the proposed method can improve the key matching rate by up to 25%. We also conduct security analysis and the randomness test, which shows that SolarKey is resilient to common attacks such as the eavesdropping attack and the imitating attack and sufficiently random.",

Nevertheless, face images taken in nighttime urban environments often suffer from low brightness, small sizes, and low resolution, which pose significant challenges for accurate face feature recognition. To address this issue, we propose the Low-light Small-target Face Enhancement (LSFE) method, a collaborative learning-based image brightness enhancement approach specifically designed for small-target faces in low-light environments. LSFE employs a multilevel feature stratification module to acquire detailed face image features at different levels, revealing hidden facial image information within the dark. In addition, we design a network combining collaborative learning and self-attention mechanisms, which effectively captures long-distance pixel dependencies in low-brightness face images and enhances their brightness in a stepwise manner. The enhanced feature maps are then fused through a branch fusion module. Experimental results demonstrate that LSFE can more effectively enhance the luminance of small-target face images in low-light scenes while retaining more visual information, compared to other existing methods.",

A lot of works have been done to optimize the Relay Node Placement (RNP), which determines the underlying topology of IWSNs and hence impacts the network performance. However, existing RNP algorithms use a fixed communication radius to compute the deployment result at once offline, while ignoring that the radio environment may vary drastically across different locations, also known as radio irregularity. To address this limitation, we propose a Voronoi diagram and Q-learning based RNP (VQRNP) method in this article. Instead of using a fixed communication radius, VQRNP employs the Q-learning algorithm to dynamically update the radio environment of measured areas, uses a Voronoi diagram based method to estimate the radio environment of unmeasured areas, and proposes a coverage extension location selection algorithm to place RNs so as to extend the coverage of the deployed network based on the results estimated by Voronoi diagram based Graph Generating (VGG). In this way, the VQRPN method can adapt itself well to the variation of radio environment and largely speed up the deployment process. Extensive simulations verify that VQRNP significantly outperforms existing RNP algorithms in terms of reliability.",

However, this performance is obtained under controlled scenarios where cardiac signals maintain a relatively uniform pattern, facilitating the identification process. In this work, we analyze cardiac signals collected in more realistic (uncontrolled) scenarios and show that their high signal variability makes them harder to obtain stable and distinct features. When faced with these irregular signals, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reduces its performance significantly. To solve these problems, we propose the CardioID framework 1 with two novel properties. First, we design an adaptive method that achieves stable and distinct features by tailoring the filtering process according to each user’s heart rate. Second, we show that users can have multiple cardiac morphologies, offering us a bigger pool of cardiac signals compared to the SOTA. Considering three uncontrolled datasets, our evaluation shows two main insights. First, while using a PPG sensor with healthy individuals, the SOTA’s balanced accuracy (BAC) reduces from 90–95% to 75–80%, while our method maintains a BAC above 90%. Second, under more challenging conditions (using smartphone cameras or monitoring unhealthy individuals), the SOTA’s BAC reduces to values between 65–75%, and our method increases the BAC to values between 75–85%.",

Unlike traditional techniques for identifying people, the Wi-Fi-based technique is unconstrained by illumination conditions and such that it eliminates the need for dense, specialized sensors and wearable devices. Although deep learning-based sensing models are conducive to the development of Wi-Fi-based identification, the latter technique relies on a large amount of data and requires a long training time, where this limits the scope of its use for identifying people. In this study, we propose a Wi-Fi sensing model called Wave-CapNet for human identification. We use data processing to eliminate errors in the raw data so that the model can extract the characteristics in channel state information (CSI). We also design a dedicated adaptive wavelet neural network to extract representative features from Wi-Fi signals with only a few epochs of training and a small number of parameters. Experiments show that it can identify human gait with an average accuracy of 99%. Moreover, it can achieve an average accuracy of 95% by using only 10% of the data and fewer than five epochs and outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of deep learning, recent research on intelligent and interactive mobile applications (e.g., health monitoring, speech recognition) has attracted extensive attention. And these applications necessitate the mobile edge computing scheme, i.e., offloading partial computation from mobile devices to edge devices for inference acceleration and transmission load reduction. The current practices have relied on collaborative DNN partition and offloading to satisfy the predefined latency requirements, which is intractable to adapt to the dynamic deployment context at runtime. AdaMEC, a context-adaptive and dynamically combinable DNN deployment framework, is proposed to meet these requirements for mobile edge computing, which consists of three novel techniques. First, once-for-all DNN pre-partition divides DNN at the primitive operator level and stores partitioned modules into executable files, defined as pre-partitioned DNN atoms. Second, context-adaptive DNN atom combination and offloading introduces a graph-based decision algorithm to quickly search the suitable combination of atoms and adaptively make the offloading plan under dynamic deployment contexts. Third, runtime latency predictor provides timely latency feedback for DNN deployment considering both DNN configurations and dynamic contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaMEC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of latency reduction by up to 62.14% and average memory saving by 55.21%.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning is an emerging paradigm that provides privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple participants for model training without sharing private data. The participants with heterogeneous devices and networking resources decelerate the training and aggregation. The dataset of the participant also possesses a high level of variability, which means the characteristics of the dataset change over time. Moreover, it is a prerequisite to preserve the personalized characteristics of the local dataset on each participant device to achieve better performance. This article proposes a model personalization-based federated learning approach in the presence of variability in the local datasets. The approach involves participants with heterogeneous devices and networking resources. The central server initiates the approach and constructs a base model that executes on most participants. The approach simultaneously learns the personalized model and handles the variability in the datasets. We propose a knowledge distillation-based early-halting approach for devices where the base model does not fit directly. The early halting speeds up the training of the model. We also propose an aperiodic global update approach that helps participants to share their updated parameters aperiodically with server. Finally, we perform a real-world study to evaluate the performance of the approach and compare with state-of-the-art techniques.",

Sensors are a key source of information for smart transportation, and their data commonly includes complicated traffic scene information. Urban traffic scheduling and efficiency can be significantly increased by deploying data from smart sensors to forecast traffic flows. Despite the fact that some related works have focused on the prediction task of traffic flows, they have not completely mined the traffic spatiotemporal information present in smart sensor data. We offer a novel graph spatio-temporal attention algorithm (GSAA) for traffic prediction in this paper. To completely exploit the geographical and temporal correlations among complicated roadways for traffic forecast, the algorithm combines a spatiotemporal attention mechanism with a graph neural network.To take full advantage of how much effect various hyperparameters provide, deep reinforcement learning is used to obtain the optimal hyperparameters while the predictive model is trained. Experimental results on real-world public datasets show that the algorithm proposed in this paper achieves performance improvements of about 5.47% and 13.10% over the MAE (mean absolute error) than the best baseline strategies for short-term and long-term traffic forecasting, respectively.",

The key challenge in using a mobile observer is that it remains within range of any sensor for a limited period, and inability to transfer data in this period causes data loss. This prompts us to choose the fraction of nodes successful in communicating data as our performance constraint as we try to minimize network power. First, we establish that the process of data collection by a mobile observer is analogous to a queue. The queuing-based data collection model is then used as a design tool to identify the combination of system parameters that satisfies the performance metric with minimum power. Second, we derive a sufficient condition on node placement for zero data loss in a mobile observer network. As our third contribution, we demonstrate that in a dense network, the data collection analysis is much simpler, which allows us to obtain closed expressions for the network power. Power comparisons with static observer networks show that power reduction by multiple orders of magnitude is typical. The scenarios chosen for power comparisons also provide guidelines on the choice of path, if such a choice is available. As an example, a disc shaped network is analyzed and among the set of concentric circular paths, the best path is identified.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose, LeaD , a new vibration-based communication protocol to Lea rn the unique patterns of vibration to D ecode the short messages transmitted to smart IoT devices. Unlike the existing vibration-based communication protocols that decode the short messages symbol-wise, either in binary or multi-ary, the message recipient in LeaD receives vibration signals corresponding to bits-groups. Each group consists of multiple symbols sent in a burst and the receiver decodes the group of symbols as a whole via machine learning-based approach. The fundamental behind LeaD is different combinations of symbols (1 s or 0 s) in a group will produce unique and reproducible patterns of vibration. Therefore, decoding in vibration-based communication can be modeled as a pattern classification problem. We design and implement a number of different machine learning models as the core engine of the decoding algorithm of LeaD to learn and recognize the vibration patterns. Through the intensive evaluations on large amount of datasets collected, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model achieves the highest accuracy of decoding (i.e., lowest error rate), which is up to 97% at relatively high bits rate of 40 bits/s. While its competing vibration-based communication protocols can only achieve transmission rate of 10 bits/s and 20 bits/s with similar decoding accuracy. Furthermore, we evaluate its performance under different challenging practical settings and the results show that LeaD with CNN engine is robust to poses, distances (within valid range), and types of devices, therefore, a CNN model can be generally trained beforehand and widely applicable for different IoT devices under different circumstances. Finally, we implement LeaD on both off-the-shelf smartphone and smart watch to measure the detailed resources consumption on smart devices. The computation time and energy consumption of its different components show that LeaD is lightweight and can run in situ on low-cost smart IoT devices, e.g., smartwatches, without accumulated delay and introduces only marginal system overhead.",

    "abstract": "To maintain productivity and alertness, individuals must be thermally comfortable in the space they occupy (whether it is a cubicle, a room, a car, etc.). However, it is often difficult to non-intrusively assess an occupant’s “thermal comfort,” and hence most HVAC engineers adopt fixed temperature settings to “err on the safe side.” These set temperatures can be too hot or too cold for individuals wearing different clothing, and as a result lead to feelings of discomfort as well as wastage of energy. Since humans dress to target a comfortable thermal sensation, it is reasonable to assume that clothing is an important measure of current thermal sensation. To this end, we develop SiCILIA, a platform that extracts physical and personal variables of an occupant’s thermal environment to infer the amount of clothing insulation without human intervention. The proposed inference algorithm builds upon theories of body heat transfer and is corroborated by empirical data. SiCILIA was tested in a vehicle with a passenger-controlled HVAC system. Experimental results show that the algorithm is capable of accurately predicting an occupant’s thermal insulation with a mean prediction error of 0.07clo.",

    "abstract": "Urban traffic sensing has been investigated extensively by different real-time sensing approaches due to important applications such as navigation and emergency services. Basically, the existing traffic sensing approaches can be classified into two categories by sensing natures, i.e., explicit and implicit sensing. In this article, we design a measurement framework called EXIMIUS for a large-scale data-driven study to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of two sensing approaches by using two particular systems for traffic sensing as concrete examples. In our investigation, we utilize TB-level data from two systems: (i) GPS data from five thousand vehicles, (ii) signaling data from three million cellphone users, from the Chinese city Hefei. Our study adopts a widely used concept called crowdedness level to rigorously explore the impacts of contexts on traffic conditions including population density, region functions, road categories, rush hours, holidays, weather, and so on, based on various context data. We quantify the strengths and weaknesses of these two sensing approaches in different scenarios and then we explore the possibility of unifying two sensing approaches for better performance by using a truth discovery-based data fusion scheme. Our results provide a few valuable insights for urban sensing based on explicit and implicit data from transportation and telecommunication domains.",

    "abstract": "Smartphone localization is essential to a wide spectrum of applications in the era of mobile computing. The ubiquity of smartphone mobile cameras and surveillance ambient cameras holds promise for offering sub-meter accuracy localization services thanks to the maturity of computer vision techniques. In general, ambient-camera-based solutions are able to localize pedestrians in video frames at fine-grained, but the tracking performance under dynamic environments remains unreliable. On the contrary, mobile-camera-based solutions are capable of continuously tracking pedestrians; however, they usually involve constructing a large volume of image database, a labor-intensive overhead for practical deployment. We observe an opportunity of integrating these two most promising approaches to overcome above limitations and revisit the problem of smartphone localization with a fresh perspective. However, fusing mobile-camera-based and ambient-camera-based systems is non-trivial due to disparity of camera in terms of perspectives, parameters and incorrespondence of localization results. In this article, we propose iMAC, an integrated mobile cameras and ambient cameras based localization system that achieves sub-meter accuracy and enhanced robustness with zero-human start-up effort. The key innovation of iMAC is a well-designed fusing frame to eliminate disparity of cameras including a construction of projection map function to automatically calibrate ambient cameras, an instant crowd fingerprints model to describe user motion patterns, and a confidence-aware matching algorithm to associate results from two sub-systems. We fully implement iMAC on commodity smartphones and validate its performance in five different scenarios. The results show that iMAC achieves a remarkable localization accuracy of 0.68 m, outperforming the state-of-the-art systems by &gt;75%.",

    "abstract": "This article narrows the gap between physical sensing systems that measure physical signals and social sensing systems that measure information signals by (i) defining a novel algorithm for extracting information signals (building on results from text embedding) and (ii) showing that it increases the accuracy of truth discovery—the separation of true information from false/manipulated one. The work is applied in the context of separating true and false facts on social media, such as Twitter and Reddit, where users post predominantly short microblogs. The new algorithm decides how to aggregate the signal across words in the microblog for purposes of clustering the miscroblogs in the latent information signal space, where it is easier to separate true and false posts. Although previous literature extensively studied the problem of short text embedding/representation, this article improves previous work in three important respects: (1) Our work constitutes unsupervised truth discovery, requiring no labeled input or prior training. (2) We propose a new distance metric for efficient short text similarity estimation, we call Semantic Subset Matching , that improves our ability to meaningfully cluster microblog posts in the latent information signal space. (3) We introduce an iterative framework that jointly improves miscroblog clustering and truth discovery. The evaluation shows that the approach improves the accuracy of truth-discovery by 6.3%, 2.5%, and 3.8% (constituting a 38.9%, 14.2%, and 18.7% reduction in error, respectively) in three real Twitter data traces.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of intermittent grid-tied solar capacity is making the job of balancing electricity’s real-time supply and demand increasingly challenging. Recent work proposes mechanisms for actively controlling solar power in the grid at individual sites by enabling software to cap it as a fraction of its time-varying maximum output. However, while enforcing an equal fraction of each solar site’s time-varying maximum output results in “fair” short-term contributions of solar power across all sites, it does not result in “fair” long-term contributions of solar energy. Enforcing fair long-term energy access is important when controlling distributed solar capacity, since limits on solar output impact the compensation users receive for net metering and the battery capacity required to store excess solar energy. This discrepancy arises from fundamental differences in enforcing “fair” access to the grid to contribute solar energy, compared to analogous fair sharing in networks and processors. To address the problem, we first present both a centralized and distributed algorithm to enable control of distributed solar capacity that enforces fair grid energy access. We then present multiple policies that show how utilities can leverage this new distributed rate-limiting mechanism to reduce variations in grid demand from intermittent solar generation.",

However, most of the proposed algorithms cannot be used for on-demand deployment because of the unavailable preset fingerprints (prior landmark or context information) in their assumption. Another issue is that those algorithms with models built in an interference-free environment cannot work in interference-rich environments. To address those issues, we propose a localizing and tracking algorithm called Enhanced Field Division (EFD), which dynamically divides the field into areas with unique signatures and tracks the target without any fingerprints. We also implemented a proof-of-concept localization platform to demonstrate the tracking accuracy and the algorithm performance in practical, interference-rich environments.",

    "abstract": "The big data phenomenon has gained much attention in the wireless communications field. Addressing big data is a challenging and time-demanding task that requires a large computational infrastructure to ensure successful data processing and analysis. In such a context, data compression helps to reduce the amount of data required to represent redundant information while reliably preserving the original content as much as possible. We here consider Compressed Sensing (CS) theory for extracting critical information and representing it with substantially reduced measurements of the original data. For CS application, it is, however, required to design a convenient sparsifying basis or transform. In this work, a large amount of bi-dimensional (2D) correlated signals are considered for compression. The envisaged application is that of data collection in large scale Wireless Sensor Networks. We show that, using CS, it is possible to recover a large amount of data from the collection of a reduced number of sensors readings. In this way, CS use makes it possible to recover large data sets with acceptable accuracy as well as reduced global scale cost. For sparsifying basis search, in addition to conventional sparsity-inducing methods, we propose a new transformation based on Linear Prediction Coding (LPC) that effectively exploits correlation between neighboring data. The steps of data aggregation using CS include sparse compression basis design and then decomposition matrix construction and recovery algorithm application. Comparisons to the case of one-dimensional (1D) reading and to conventional 2D compression methods show the benefit from the better exploitation of the correlation by herein envisaged 2D processing. Simulation results on both synthetic and real WSN data demonstrate that the proposed LPC approach with 2D scenario realizes significant reconstruction performance enhancement compared to former conventional transformations.",

In this work, we present a robust objects classification and 6D object pose estimation strategy by dual fusion of image and point cloud data. Instead of solely relying on 3D proposals or mature 2D object detectors, our model deeply integrates 2D and 3D information of heterogeneous data sources by a robustness dual fusion network and an attention-based nonlinear fusion function Attn-fun(.), achieving efficiency as well as high accuracy classification for even missed some data sources. Then, our method is also able to precisely estimate the transformation matrix between two input objects by minimizing the feature difference to achieve 6D object pose estimation, even under strong noise or with outliers. We deploy our proposed method not only to ModelNet40 datasets but also to a real fusion vision rotating platform for tracking objects in outer space based on the estimated pose.",

The latter, although inaudible, falls short in throughput due to the available (near) ultrasonic bandwidth. In this article, we achieve both high speed and inaudibility for acoustic communication by utilizing the nonlinearity effect on microphones. We theoretically prove the maximum throughput of inaudible acoustic communication by modulating an audible signal onto an ultrasonic band. Then, we design and implement UltraComm , which utilizes a specially designed OFDM scheme. The scheme takes into account the characteristics of the nonlinear speaker-to-microphone channel, aiming to mitigate the effects of signal distortion.

For satisfying the smart requirements of CPSS design, a cloud-edge collaborative CPSS framework is first proposed in this paper. Then Coupled-Hidden-Markov-Model (CHMM) and tensor algebra are used to improve existing activity prediction methods for providing CPSS with more intelligent decision support. There are three key features (timing, periodicity and correlation) implied in CPSS data from multi-edge, which affects the accuracy of activity prediction. Thus, these features are synthetically integrated into improved Tensor-based CHMMs (T-CHMMs) to enhance the prediction accuracy. Based on the multi-edge CPSS data, three Tensor-based Viterbi Algorithms (TVA) are correspondingly proposed to solve the prediction problem for T-CHMMs. Compared with traditional matrix-based methods, the proposed TVA could more accurately compute the optimal hidden state sequences under given observation sequences. Finally, the comprehensive performances of proposed models and algorithms are validated on three open datasets by self-comparison and other-comparison. The experimental results show that the proposed methods is superior to the compared three classical methods in terms of F1 measure, average precision and average recall.",

But a global view of energy awareness that considers these factors and looks at various tradeoffs is essential. To this end, we present results from our detailed empirical study of battery charge-discharge characteristics and the impact of altitude and lighting on edge inference accuracy. Our energy models, derived from these observations, predict energy usage while performing various manoeuvres with an error of 5.6%, a 2.5X improvement over the state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Despite considerable technological advances for smart cities, they still face problems such as instability of cloud server connection, insecurity during data transmission, and slight deficiencies in TCP/IP network architecture. To address such issues, we propose a data-driven intelligence approach to security decisions under Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture for edge computing, taking into consideration factors that impact device entry in smart cities, such as device performance, load, Bluetooth signal strength, and scan frequency. Despite existing techniques for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)-based on entropy weights methods are improved and applied, there exist unstable decision results. Due to this, we propose a technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)-based on utility function and entropy weights, named UETOPSIS, where the corresponding utility function is applied according to the influence of each attribute on the decision, ensuring the stability of the ranking of decision results. We rely on an entropy-based weights mechanism to select a suitable master controller for the design of the multi-control protocol in the smart city system, and utilize a utility function to calculate the attribute values and then combine the normalized attribute values of utility numbers, starting by analyzing the main work of the controllers. Lastly, a prototype is developed for performance evaluation purposes. Experimental evaluation and analysis show that the proposed work has better authenticity and reliability than existing works and can reduce the workload of edge computing devices when forwarding data, with stability 24.7% higher than TOPSIS, significantly improving the performance and stability of system fault tolerance and reliability in smart cities, as the second-ranked controller can efficiently take over the work when a central controller fails or damaged.",

This flexibility allows for extended sensor inactivity periods without compromising data accuracy. TG-SPRED addresses the complexities of event-based sensing—a domain that has been somewhat overlooked in existing literature—by recognizing and leveraging the inherent temporal and spatial correlations among events. It combines the strengths of Gated Recurrent Units and Graph Convolutional Networks to analyze temporal data and spatial relationships within the sensor network graph, where connections are defined by sensor proximities. An adversarial training mechanism, featuring a critic network employing the Wasserstein distance for performance measurement, further refines the predictive accuracy. Comparative analysis against six leading solutions using four critical metrics—F-score, energy consumption, network lifetime, and computational efficiency—showcases our approach’s superior performance in both accuracy and energy efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The smart city is an increasingly popular concept when it comes to urban development. In a smart city, numerous sensor services are generated by IoT sensors in a distributed manner, requiring proper management and effective interaction to guarantee the connectivity of different regions. However, the sensitive nature of sensor data raises concerns over joining public cloud centers or edge servers, despite assurances of their reliability from providers. Local deployment and maintenance of sensor services may cause these service providers to become ”data isolated islands”, hindering the construction process of smart city. This paper proposes a distributed trustworthy sensor service network architecture named DTSSN to support the building of a fully distributed sensor service network. The proposed network architecture operates through the collaboration of two core devices, the sensor service switch and router, to effectively enable the registration, discovery, invocation, transaction, and monitoring of cross-region sensor services. Then, a lightweight trustworthy transaction mechanism based on blockchain is proposed to realize SLA-based automatic service transaction while reducing potential risks in the service network. Comparative analysis and simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the DTSSN architecture in terms of scalability, availability, and trustworthiness, underscoring its potential in advancing smart city development and governance.",

    "abstract": "With the help of 5G network, edge intelligence (EI) can not only provide distributed, low-latency, and high-reliable intelligent services, but also enable intelligent maintenance and management of smart city. However, the constantly changing available computing resources of end devices and edge servers cannot continuously guarantee the performance of intelligent inference. In order to guarantee the sustainability of intelligent services in smart city, we propose the Adaptive Model Selection and Partition Mechanism (AMSPM) in 5G smart city where EI provides services, which mainly consists of Adaptive Model Selection (AMS) and Adaptive Model Partition (AMP). In AMSPM, the model selection and partition of deep neural network (DNN) are formulated as an optimization problem. Firstly, we propose a recursive-based algorithm named AMS based on the computing resources of edge devices to derive an appropriate DNN model that satisfies the latency demand of intelligent services. Then, we adaptively partition the selected DNN model according to the computing resources of edge devices. The experimental results demonstrate that, when compared with state-of-the-art model selection and partition mechanisms, AMSPM not only reduces latency but also enhances computing resource utilization.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic motion tracking is rapidly evolving with various applications. However, existing approaches still have some limitations. Tracking based on single-frequency continuous wave (CW) faces cumulative errors in tracking and limited accuracy in tracking the absolute location of the target. Tracking based on frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) faces errors introduced by the Doppler and multipath effects. To overcome these limitations, we propose FusionTrack, a novel device-free motion-tracking approach that leverages the fusion of CW and FMCW signals. We eliminate the absolute tracking errors of FMCW-based tracking by compensating for Doppler frequency offsets with the results of CW-based relative tracking. Furthermore, we address the static multipath with down-sampling and filtering and mitigate the dynamic multipath with chirp aggregation. We employ a Kalman filter-based fusion of relative and absolute tracking to enhance accuracy further. We implement FusionTrack on Android smartphones for real-time tracking and perform extensive experiments. The results show that FusionTrack achieves real-time 1D tracking with an accuracy of 1.5 mm, which is 46% better than the existing approaches and extends the 1D tracking range to 2.2 m, which is 3.1× of the existing approaches. FusionTrack also achieves a 2D tracking accuracy of 4.5 mm.",

Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of AD play a vital role in slowing disease progression. However, existing detection methods for cognitive impairment cannot consistently screen the stage of AD. To tackle this challenge, we propose an AD detection system, Ubi-AD, which combines the features of multiple biomarkers to realize passive and accurate AD detection. Unlike existing work, Ubi-AD can passively recognize the AD digital biomarkers during daily smartwatch usage without interfering with the user. At the user end, Ubi-AD first extracts the non-speech sounds (pause words, such as em, ah), which contain no privacy-sensitive content. Then, Ubi-AD recognizes the user’s walking activity, dining activity, and sleep activity from daily activities. Ubi-AD analyzes these data from smartwatch and predicts the AD stages using a multi-modal fusion neural network at the cloud end. We evaluate our model on a collected dataset from 45 volunteers. As a result, Ubi-AD can reach a detection accuracy of 93.4%, which means that Ubi-AD can provide multiple effective biomarkers for ubiquitous and passive detection in daily life.",

    "abstract": "Spatial crowdsourcing leverages the widespread use of mobile devices to outsource tasks to a crowd of users based on their geographical location. Despite its growing popularity, current crowdsourcing systems often suffer from a lack of transparency, centralization, and other security issues. Blockchain technology has revolutionized this sector with its potential for decentralization, security, and transparency. However, existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing systems often overlook efficient task assignment mechanisms and expose users to potential losses due to the obligatory deposit payments to smart contracts, which might be vulnerable or untrustworthy. This article proposes EDF-Crowd, an E fficient and D eposit- F ree blockchain-based spatial crowdsoucing framework, to address these challenges. EDF-Crowd introduces an efficient, customizable task assignment mechanism based on smart contracts, operating periodically and batch-wise. We also design a fair compensation mechanism to compensate users for the extra overhead caused by invoking certain smart contracts. More importantly, we propose a series of linkage protocols. By linking users’ back-and-forth actions, EDF-Crowd can regulate user behavior without requiring users to deposit. The versatility of EDF-Crowd also allows its application to generic crowdsourcing systems with minimal modifications. We implement EDF-Crowd based on the EOS blockchain. Extensive evaluations show that EDF-Crowd achieves high task assignment efficiency and low cost.",

    "abstract": "Passive human tracking using Wi-Fi has been researched broadly in the past decade. Besides straightforward anchor point localization, velocity is another vital sign adopted by the existing approaches to infer user trajectory. However, state-of-the-art Wi-Fi velocity estimation relies on Doppler-Frequency-Shift (DFS), which suffers from the inevitable signal noise incurring unbounded velocity errors, further degrading the tracking accuracy. In this article, we present WiVelo, which explores new spatial-temporal signal correlation features observed from different antennas to achieve accurate velocity estimation. First, we use subcarrier shift distribution (SSD) extracted from channel state information (CSI) to define two correlation features for direction and speed estimation, separately. Then, we design a mesh model calculated by the antennas’ locations to enable a fine-grained velocity estimation with bounded direction error. Finally, with the continuously estimated velocity, we develop an end-to-end trajectory recovery algorithm to mitigate velocity outliers with the property of walking velocity continuity. We implement WiVelo on commodity Wi-Fi hardware and extensively evaluate its tracking accuracy in various environments. The experimental results show our median and 90-percentile tracking errors are 0.47 m and 1.06 m, which are half and a quarter of state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Breakthroughs in Wireless Energy Transfer technologies have revitalized Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks. However, how to schedule mobile chargers rationally has been quite a tricky problem. Most of the current work does not consider the variability of scenarios and how many mobile chargers should be scheduled as the most appropriate for each dispatch. At the same time, the focus of most work on the mobile charger scheduling problem has always been on reducing the number of dead nodes, and the most critical metric of network performance, packet arrival rate, is relatively neglected. In this article, we develop a DRL-based Partial Charging algorithm. Based on the number and urgency of charging requests, we classify charging requests into four scenarios. And for each scenario, we design a corresponding request allocation algorithm. Then, a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm is employed to train a decision model using environmental information to select which request allocation algorithm is optimal for the current scenario. After the allocation of charging requests is confirmed, to improve the Quality of Service, i.e., the packet arrival rate of the entire network, a partial charging scheduling algorithm is designed to maximize the total charging duration of nodes in the ideal state while ensuring that all charging requests are completed. In addition, we analyze the traffic information of the nodes and use the Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine the importance of the nodes to compensate for the inaccurate estimation of the node’s remaining lifetime in realistic scenarios. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms regarding the number of alive nodes and packet arrival rate.",

Although some aggregation algorithms can enhance the robustness of FL against malicious clients, our work demonstrates that existing stealthy poisoning attacks can still bypass these defense methods. In this work, we propose a robust aggregation mechanism, called Parts and All ( PnA ), to protect the global model of FL by filtering out malicious local model updates throughout the detection of poisoning attacks at layers of local model updates. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three representative datasets.

EVs need to be charged, but the number of charging piles in a Charging Station (CS) is limited, and charging is usually more time-consuming than fueling. According to this scenario, we propose a secure and efficient charging scheduling system based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-blockchain and double-auction mechanism. In a smart area, it attempts to assign EVs to the available CSs in the light of their submitted charging requests and status information. First, we design a lightweight charging scheduling framework that integrates DAG-blockchain and modern cryptography technology to ensure security and scalability during performing scheduling and completing tradings. In this process, a constrained multi-item double-auction problem is formulated because of the limited charging resources in a CS, which motivates EVs and CSs in this area to participate in the market based on their preferences and statuses. Due to this constraint, our problem is more complicated and harder to achieve truthfulness as well as system efficiency compared to the existing double-auction model. To adapt to it, we propose two algorithms, namely, Truthful Mechanism for Charging (TMC) and Efficient Mechanism for Charging (EMC), to determine an assignment between EVs and CSs and pricing strategies. Then, both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.",

However, considering DNN is typically computational-intensive and resource-hungry, conventional placement approaches ignore the influence of multi-dimensional resource requirements (processor, memory, etc.), which may degrade the real-time performance. Moreover, with the increasing scale of geo-distributed edge servers, centralized decision-making is still challenging to find the optimal strategies effectively.

Heavy measurement tasks may compete limited resources with communication tasks and significantly degrade overall network performance.

To address this challenge in wireless sensor networks, our core insight is to use power as a new dimension for interference graph estimation (IGE) such that IGE can be done simultaneously with the communication tasks using the same frequency-time resources. We propose to marry power-domain IGE with concurrent flooding to achieve simultaneous measurement and communication in BLE networks, where the power linearity prerequisite for power-domain IGE holds naturally true in concurrent flooding. With extensive experiments, we conclude the necessary conditions for the power linearity to hold and analyze several nonlinearity issues of power related to hardware imperfections. We design and implement network protocols and power control algorithms for IGE in multi-hop BLE networks and conduct experiments to show that the marriage is mutually beneficial for both IGE and concurrent flooding.

To realize this potential, a well-designed vehicle scheduling scheme is essential for deploying the recruited drivers efficiently. Nevertheless, existing works fail to consider the marginal effect among drivers’ collections. Different from them, this article introduces a, to the best of our knowledge, new multiple-vehicle scheduling problem that jointly optimizes task allocation and vehicle trajectory planning to maximize the overall collection utility by accounting for the marginal effect in drivers’ data collections. However, solving this problem is non-trivial due to its involvement with multiple coupled NP-hard problems. To this end, we propose MeSched, a marginal effect-aware multiple-vehicle scheduling scheme designed for road data collection. Specifically, we first present a greedy-based auxiliary graph construction method to disentangle the initial problem into multiple independent single-vehicle scheduling subproblems. Furthermore, we build an approximate surrogate function that transforms each subproblem into a tractable form involving only a single variable. The theoretical analysis proves that MeSched can achieve a 1-(1/ e ) ¼ -approximation ratio in polynomial time. Comprehensive evaluations based on a real-world trajectory dataset of 12,493 vehicles demonstrate that MeSched can significantly improve the collection utility by 104.5% on average compared with four baselines.",

Recently, a few wireless sensing systems have been proposed for material identification. In this paper, we introduce mm-CUR, A Novel Ubiquitous, Contact-free, and Location-aware Counterfeit Currency Detection in Bundles using a Millimeter-Wave Sensor. This system eliminates the need for individual note inspection and pinpoints the location of counterfeit notes within the bundle. We use Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensors to classify different counterfeit currency bundles on a tabletop setup. To extract informative features for currency detection from FMCW signals, we construct a Radio Frequency Snapshot (RFS) and build signal scalogram representations that capture the distinct patterns of currency received from different currency bundles. We refine the RFS by eliminating multi-path interference, and noise cancellation and apply high pass filters for mitigating the smearing effect with the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). To broaden the usage of mm-CUR, we built a transferable learning model that yields robust detection results in different scenarios. The classification results demonstrated that the proposed counterfeit currency detection system can detect counterfeit notes in 100-note bundles with an accuracy greater than 93%. Compared to the standard CNN and DNN methods, the proposed mm-CUR model showed superior performance in distinguishing each bundle data, even for a limited-size dataset.",

Particularly, at data feeding layer, we make use of two urban 60-day GPS traces involving respectively 37,801 and 17,517 vehicles, to extract the analytics samples. At mobility characterization layer, we conduct extensive data analytics on traffic mobility in terms of their distribution, correlation, and variation, to mine the crucial traffic mobility patterns for strategy customization. At cache deployment layer, we propose the K -order subgraph for each block to record the moving statistics within its K -order neighborhood, and transform the SDRM problem accordingly. Then, the R oute we I ght ba S ed gr E edy ( RISE ) algorithm is devised for the problem, which can deliver the deployment decisions. Extensive data-driven experiments are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of CoDe in terms of request hit ratio and caching resource utility.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent voice systems are widely utilized to control smart home applications, which raises significant privacy and security concerns. Recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, replay attacks, etc. However, these attacks rely on the victim’s voice data. In our work, we investigate a stealthy and command-independent attack that does not necessitate collecting victims’ voices. Our proposed attack, IUAC, misleads the voice system to go against the victim’s will, regardless of the commands delivered. Our core concept is to train highly robust attack commands through the construction of diverse data, rendering the user’s commands negligible. To achieve stealthy attacks, we leverage a high-frequency carrier to construct an inaudible universal adversarial command. Extensive experiments conducted with real-world datasets demonstrate that our attack system attains an average attack success rate of 96% while resisting environmental interference. Moreover, our attack success rate against real-world voice systems is 4.52 × higher than the state-of-the-art. Finally, we propose an effective defense mechanism and provide experimental tests to validate its efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Personalized federated learning (PFL) framework that targets individual models for optimization provides better privacy and flexibility for clients. However, in challenging intelligent sensing applications, the heterogeneous client’s data distributions make the aggregation of local models in the server unstable or even hard to converge. To deal with the performance degradation caused by the above problem, existing PFL methods focus more on how to fine-tune the global model but ignore the impact of the global model fusion algorithm on the results. In this paper, we propose a new explainable neural-aware decoupling fusion based PFL framework, p-FedADF , to address the above challenges. It contains two carefully designed modules. The local decoupling module deployed on the client, utilizes the architecture disentangle technique to decouple the feature extractors in the client’s local model into sub-network according to data categories. It obtains the inference process of feature extraction for different categories of data by training. The global aggregation module, deployed on the server, aligns the sub-networks positions for multiple clients and implements a fine-grained generic feature extractor aggregation. In addition, we provide a mask encoding scheme to reduce the communication overhead of transmitting the sub-network sets between the server and clients. Our p-FedADF obtains 1.6%, 0.2%, 2.3%, and 4.5% improvement on a real-world dataset and three benchmark datasets, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

    "abstract": "End-edge collaborative inference enhances computational efficiency by segmenting a deep neural network (DNN) model into two parts, executed across the end device and the edge node. However, existing collaborative inference strategies often involve transmitting original inputs from the end device to the edge node, resulting in significant risks of user detail leakage without requiring input reconstruction. Therefore, in this work, we present SecoInfer, a secure layer-level DNN end-edge collaborative inference framework. SecoInfer achieves joint optimization of data privacy and inference latency for DNN partition solutions that meet latency constraints, supported by three key designs. First, the privacy-aware DNN layer projection measurement quantifies the difficulty adversaries encounter in reconstructing the original input from the intermediate output of each layer. Then, the latency-privacy integrated structure modeling enables the direct calculation of the privacy measurement and inference latency for each partition solution from a list element or a directed acyclic graph (DAG) cut. Finally, the two-stage latency constraint adjustment scheme narrows down the search space of feasible partition solutions at the block level and fine-tunes the final one to meet the latency constraint based on layer depth. We prototype SecoInfer, utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4B as the end device and a server with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU as the edge node. Experimental results demonstrate that under latency constraints of 20 ms, 33 ms, and 40 ms, SecoInfer reduces adversarial data reconstruction by 9.84%, 19.26%, and 25.18%, respectively, without any loss of task model accuracy. SecoInfer also enhances efficiency, reducing the time needed to determine optimal end-edge partition solutions on a Raspberry Pi 4B by 18.04%.",

    "abstract": "Visual Mobile Crowd-Sensing(VMCS) collects photos by leveraging camera embedded in mobile users’ phones. There are two important issues in VMCS: determining whether photos collected by mobile users meet the requirements or not and designing an appropriate mechanism to attract mobile users to provide photos that meet the requirements. In this paper, we address those two issues when VMCS is applied to emergency monitoring applications. We first model an emergency scene as a disk region and define a coverage angle metric that quantifies the coverage ratio provided by each photo, and then formulate Maximize Coverage Angle under a Limited Budget(MCALB) problem. The goal of this paper is to recruit mobile users to provide panoramic view coverage for a disk while the total reward paid to participants does not exceed the budget. In our solution, we first propose a Coverage Angle Computation (CAC) algorithm to calculate the coverage angle of each uploaded photo. Then two incentive mechanisms: Guidance based Incentive Mechanism (GIM) and Coverage Prediction Incentive Mechanism (CPIM) are designed to encourage mobile users to upload photos with coverage angle that are not provided by other mobile users. Finally, we design a mobile app called I-share in android system to implement system. Meanwhile, we have recruited students to install I-share and simulated the information interaction between mobile users and server. We have conducted experiments by using I-share without/with embedded CAC algorithm to validate the efficiency of two incentive mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed incentive mechanisms effectively attract mobile users to provide panoramic view coverage of emergency scenes when the budget allows. Additionally, the CPIM outperforms the GIM, offering a higher coverage ratio with lower rewards.",

In this paper, we propose Fedeval, a novel multi-dimensional evaluation framework designed to defend against Lazybone attacks. Fedeval leverages a server-side base validation dataset and a base model to assess the quality and relevance of client contributions through gradient inversion, and it compares client-uploaded gradients with an honest baseline to detect training inconsistencies. By assigning adaptive importance scores based on client contributions, Fedeval enhances the robustness of FL by mitigating the impact of non-contributing participants. We also provide a theoretical analysis of Fedeval’s convergence properties and validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on four datasets and two attack scenarios. Our results demonstrate that Fedeval significantly accelerates convergence and improves accuracy by up to 13% compared to traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology, which can charge IoT devices over the air, has become a promising technology for IoT networks. In wireless-powered IoT networks, broadcasting is a fundamental networking service for disseminating messages to the whole network. To seek a fast and collision-free broadcast schedule, the problem of Minimum Latency Broadcast Scheduling (MLBS) has been well studied when nodes are energy-abundant. However, in wireless-powered networks, a node can only receive or transmit packets after it has harvested enough energy. In such networks, it is of great importance to exploit the divergent harvested energy to reduce the broadcast latency. Unfortunately, existing works always assume a predetermined tree and a fixed transmission power for broadcast scheduling, which greatly limits their performance. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the first work for the MLBS problem in wireless-powered networks without relying on predetermined trees. Firstly, the problem is formulated and proved to be NP-hard. Then, two structure-adaptive scheduling algorithms are proposed with a theoretical bound, which can intertwine the construction of broadcast tree with the computation of an energy-aware schedule simultaneously. Furthermore, a power-aware scheduling method is also proposed to take the structure of the broadcast tree, the adjustment of nodes’ transmission powers, and the interference during transmissions into account simultaneously. Additionally, the algorithm for the MLBS problem under the physical interference model is also studied. Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of latency.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of mobile devices, bel canto practitioners increasingly utilize smart devices as auxiliary tools for improving their singing skills. However, they frequently encounter timbre abnormalities during practice, which, if left unaddressed, can potentially harm their vocal organs. Existing singing assessment systems primarily focus on pitch and melody and lack real-time detection of bel canto timbre abnormalities. Moreover, the diverse vocal habits and timbre compositions among individuals present significant challenges in cross-user recognition of such abnormalities. To address these limitations, we propose TimbreSense, a novel bel canto timbre abnormality detection system. TimbreSense enables real-time detection of the five major timbre abnormalities commonly observed in bel canto singing. We introduce an effective feature extraction pipeline that captures the acoustic characteristics of bel canto singing. By applying temporal average pooling to the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrogram, we reduce redundancy while preserving essential frequency-domain information. Our system leverages a transformer model with self-attention mechanisms to extract correlation and semantic features of overtones in the frequency domain. Additionally, we employ a few-shot learning approach involving pre-training, meta-learning, and fine-tuning to enhance the system’s cross-domain recognition performance while minimizing user usage costs. Experimental results demonstrate the system’s strong cross-user domain recognition performance and real-time capabilities.",

The Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to transform the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic optimization problem, which remains NP-hard. Thus, an approximation algorithm following greedy approach is proposed to solve the deterministic optimization problem.

As such, we develop two SUM extensions with a substantially reduced number of parameters, making calibration practical. Our evaluation also demonstrates that, as a basis for supporting mobile applications in an intracity and hourly scale, the SUM is far superior to previous UMMs. In a case study, we also show that the performance of the resource allocation scheme in a cellular network substantially improves by using SUM, with a reduction in the packet loss probability of 3.19 times.",

In this work, we introduce OPTICS, a data-driven control strategy that self-improves over time, adapts to the local specific conditions and weather changes, and requires virtually no human input in both setup and maintenance providing a plug-and-play system that requires minimal pre-deployment efforts. In addition to substantial improvements in ease-of-use, we find across 4 weeks of large-scale irrigation system deployment that OPTICS improves system efficiency by 12.0% in comparison to industry best and 3.3% in comparison to academic state of the art.

    "abstract": "The global IoT market is experiencing a fast growth with a massive number of IoT/wearable devices deployed around us and even on our bodies. This trend incorporates more users to upload data frequently and timely to the APs. Previous work mainly focus on improving the up-link throughput. However, incorporating more users to transmit concurrently is actually more important than improving the throughout for each individual user, as the IoT devices may not require very high transmission rates but the number of devices is usually large. In the current state-of-the-arts (up-link MU-MIMO), the number of transmissions is either confined to no more than the number of antennas (node-degree-of-freedom, node-DoF) at an AP or clock synchronized with cables between APs to support more concurrent transmissions. However, synchronized APs still incur a very high collaboration overhead, prohibiting its real-life adoption. We thus propose novel schemes to remove the cable-synchronization constraint while still being able to support more concurrent users than the node-DoF limit, and at the same time minimize the collaboration overhead. In this paper, we design, implement, and experimentally evaluate OpenCarrier, the first distributed system to break the user limitation for up-link MU-MIMO networks with coordinated APs. Our experiments demonstrate that OpenCarrier is able to support up to five up-link high-throughput transmissions for MU-MIMO network with 2-antenna APs.",

Smart transit cards provide detailed tapping records of commuters, which enable us to infer their trajectories under both normal and disruptive circumstances. In this article, we study and predict the impact of disruptions on commuters and further evaluate the vulnerability of the rail system. Specifically, we define two metrics, stay ratio and travel delay, to quantify the impact, and we derive the predictor of each metric based on the inferred alternative route choices of commuters under disruptive circumstances. We demonstrate that the alternative route choices contribute to more similar feature distribution among different disruptions, which is crucial to tackling the main challenge of abnormal data scarcity and is beneficial for obtaining more reliable predictors for future disruptions. We evaluate our approach with a real-world transit card dataset. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Based on the predictors, we further analyse the vulnerability of the rail system. An evaluation with cross validation from taxi GPS trajectory data indicates its efficacy in discovering vulnerable rail stations as well as Origin-Destination pairs.",

    "abstract": "Generating maps of indoor environments beyond the line-of-sight finds applications in several areas such as planning, navigation, and security. While researchers have previously explored the use of RF signals to generate maps, prior work has two important limitations: (i) it requires moving the mapping setup along the entire lengths of the sides of the building, and (ii) it generates maps that are not fully connected, rather are scatter plots of locations from where some obstacles reflected the signals. Thus, prior approaches require human interpretation to locate the walls and determine how they merge. In this article, we address these limitations and propose RFMap, which generates fully connected maps, and does not require the measurement setup to be moved along the sides of the buildings. To generate the map, RFMap first transmits RF signals in many different directions and then measures the distances of different reflectors inside the building. Next, it identifies these reflectors and classifies them into various types based on the properties of the reflections. A key challenge is that RFMap does not receive reflections from all the directions due to the specular nature of the reflectors. Due to this, it only gets sparse data about the objects in the environment. To address this challenge, RFMap trains a deep generative adversarial network (GAN) to intelligently predict the missing information. At runtime, it feeds the locations and types of the detected reflectors to the trained GAN and generates complete and accurate map. We implemented RFMap using software defined radios and extensively evaluated it in several real-world environments. Our results show that RFMap generated the maps of all the buildings that we tested it on with high accuracy.",

However, AoA tracking systems are not yet used for Internet of Things (IoT) in the real world due to their unaffordable cost. Many efforts, such as a time-sharing array, emulated array, and sparse array, were recently made to cut the cost. This work introduces a log-spiral antenna belt ( LSAB ), a new novel sparse “planar array” that could estimate the AoA of an IoT device in 3D space by using a few antennas connected to a single timeshare channel. Unlike the conventional arrays, LSAB deploys antennas on a log-spiral-shaped belt in a non-linear manner, following the theory of minimum resolution redundancy newly discovered in this work. One physical 8 × 8 uniform planar array (UPA) and four logical sparse arrays, including LSAB , were prototyped to validate the theory and evaluate the performance of sparse arrays. The extensive benchmark demonstrates that the performance of LSAB was comparable to that of a UPA, with similar degree of resolution; and LSAB could provide over 40% performance improvement than existing sparse arrays. We also prototyped a second LSAB adapted to an RFID system for localizing RFID tags at centimeter-level accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is an emerging cellular communication technology designed for low-power wide-area applications. Cell selection determines the channel of user device and hence is an important issue in cellular networks. In this article, we make the first attempt to examine and optimize the cell selection in NB-IoT networks by field measurement. We conduct measurements at 30 different locations which involve five typical application scenarios of NB-IoT. Two kinds of NB-IoT modules and two network operators are also involved in the measurements. We find four potential issues on the cell selection of the User Equipment (UE) through the measurements. We propose an adaptive cell selection approach to optimize the cell selection of UE. The simulation test based on real-world measurement data shows that the cell selected by the adaptive approach can improve the coverage level and reduce the power consumption for UE.",

Specifically, it is designed for the scenario when smart devices do not have any pre-loaded secrets. Moreover, it can be implemented when smart devices have no access to the online trusted third party or the Network Time Protocol server. In our scheme, smart devices achieve synchronization by making use of ambient sounds. Then, they calculate and obtain the pairing distance and secure distance by applying a band-pass filter. Completing these operations, two smart devices can directly extract a communication key. We analyze the security of our scheme and evaluate the performance of it by implementing the scheme using a few off-the-shelf devices. The experimental results indicate that compared with related schemes, the bit generation rate of our scheme has significant improvement (increases at least 80%), and it can reach 312 bit/s.",

    "abstract": "Based on the Internet of Behavior (IoB), mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) to recruit users by analyzing behavioral patterns. MCS is widely used in numerous large-scale and complex monitoring services, but it cannot provide stable and high-quality services due to nondeterministic user mobility and behaviors, which has a vital impact on recruiting high-quality users. In this article, a stochastic semi-algebraic hybrid system (SSAHS) model is constructed to characterize the user mobility and behaviors of the MCS systems. Based on the definition of probabilistic path and task execution rate, a nondeterministic evaluation mechanism is proposed to measure nondeterministic user mobility and behaviors and to give the probability of the user completing the MCS task under the specified time bound and space conditions. The greater the probability is, the higher the quality of the user. Furthermore, a user recruitment scheme based on a nondeterministic evaluation mechanism (NUR) is developed. The NUR employs historical user data to predict user mobility and behaviors; high-quality users are recruited to quickly upload reliable sensing data. We conduct simulation experiments based on a real-world user trace dataset, Geolife.The results show that compared with competing recruitment strategies, NUR achieves a higher quality of service for the same MCS sensing tasks.",

    "abstract": "Wireless communication over long distances has become the bottleneck for battery-powered, large-scale deployments. Low-power protocols like Zigbee and Bluetooth Low Energy have limited communication range, whereas long-range communication strategies like cellular and satellite networks are power-hungry. Technologies that use narrow-band communication like LoRa, SigFox, and NB-IoT have low spectral efficiency, leading to scalability issues. The goal of this work is to develop a communication framework that is energy efficient, long-range, and scalable. We propose, design, and prototype WiChronos, a communication paradigm that encodes information in the time interval between two narrowband symbols to drastically reduce the energy consumption in a wide area network with large number of senders. We leverage the low data-rate and relaxed latency requirements of such applications to achieve the desired features identified above. We design and implement chirp spread spectrum transmitter and receiver using off-the-shelf components to send the narrowband symbols. Based on our prototype, WiChronos achieves an impressive 60% improvement in battery life compared to state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies in transmission of payloads less than 10 bytes at experimentally verified distances of over 4 km. We also show that more than 1,000 WiChronos senders can co-exist with less than 5% collision probability under low traffic conditions.",

Smart phones equipped proximity sensors can be used to enable contact tracing, however accuracy of detection and energy efficiency is a key challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an accurate energy-efficient contact tracing (AECT) algorithm that detects which users came in contact with an infected user by performing computations at the server-side. Additionally, the AECT algorithm uses the wireless scan method, which calculates proximity based on pseudo-range multilateration and makes relevant comparisons with the matching score (MS) method based on the computation of received signal strength indication (RSSI) metric. Simulation results demonstrate that the scan method (AECT) is highly accurate and outperforms the scan method, highlighting that real distance is a better metric in contact tracing than a proxy for distance such as RSSI. Lastly, simulation results also demonstrate that the scan method (AECT) is 16 times more energy-efficient than the baseline 1 Hz frequency method, and we recommend it as a method of choice for performing contact tracing against infectious diseases such as COVID-19.",

In the paper, we propose an optimization model of heterogeneous big data parallel computing based on a hybrid Multi Point Interface (MPI)/Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) and Sensor Networks. First, the processor characteristics of heterogeneous big data architecture is analyzed, the parallel tasks among processors are divided, collect the heterogeneous big data to be computed and cluster them, and use the processing results as the input items of the model. Then, a parallel load balancing mechanism is established to optimally divide the parallel computing load of heterogeneous big data, and a parallel computing optimization program is written by combining the hybrid programming mode of MPI and OpenMP and using the hybrid MPI/OpenMP, and finally, the parallel computing optimization of heterogeneous big data is realized by optimizing the parallel communication and determining the model parameters. The results show that the proposed model has a communication bandwidth of 510Mbps, a computational volume of 1.16GB, a model runtime of 24s, and an improved network bandwidth utilization of 93%, which can effectively reduce the communication overhead, and improve the efficiency of parallel computing and bandwidth sending and receiving information in sensor networks, and shorten the model running time.",

To motivate a large number of sensor nodes and solicit more up-to-date information from these nodes, the control center usually allocates rewards to nodes according to their proportional contributions. This induces intense competitions among nodes who try to gain high payoffs by carefully balancing the rewards and the costs. In this article, we propose a novel stochastic game model to formulate the competition among sensor nodes, which considers AoI as a metric used by the control center to quantify the contributions of nodes. We also take into account the uncertainty of channel quality, which affects the transmission success ratio of packets generated by nodes. Finally, we design an ϵ-Nash learning algorithm, which adopts the θ-greedy exploration strategy, to derive the ϵ-approximate Nash equilibrium such that nodes can maximize their long-term payoffs. Our substantive simulation results and analysis verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in bringing higher payoffs to nodes and more fresh information to the control center.",

    "abstract": "Today, In-Vehicle Wireless Sensor Networks (IVWSNs) are being used by car manufacturers because it saves time in the assembling process; saves costs in the harness and after-sales; and makes vehicles lighter, which helps lessen fuel consumption. There is no definition for wireless solution technology for IVWSNs, because each one has its own characteristics, and probably this is one of the reasons for its smooth usage in the automotive industry. A gap identified in wireless sensor networks for the automotive domain is that the related literature focuses only on ordinary cars with a star topology and few of them with mesh topology. This article aims to cover this gap by presenting an experimental study performed on verifying the new Bluetooth 5 technology working in a mesh topology applied to public transportation systems (buses). To perform this evaluation, a setup to emulate an IVWSN was deployed in a working city bus. Measuring the network metrics, the bus was placed in a variety of conditions during its trajectory to determine the influence of the passengers and the whole environment on the data transmission. The results suggest that Bluetooth 5 in a mesh topology is a promising candidate for IVWSNs because it shows the robustness of losing only 0.16% packets in the worst test, as well as its ability to cover a wider range compared to its previous version, indeed a better RSSI and jitter, with lower transmission power, compared to a star topology. The round trip time results can support the analysis for time-critical applications.",

However, graph data can be reconstructed by malicious adversaries to train machine learning models from graph embeddings. This paper studies to what extent an adversary (without the original graph data) can recover the original graph data from graph embeddings. To quantify the original graph information leakage from graph embeddings, we develop a deep neural network model InferNet that can be used by adversaries to infer the original graph information from an adversary-accessible graph embedding database. More specifically, we propose the data-free reversed knowledge distillation technique to support the InferNet training even if the original graph dataset is absent. To ensure the performance of InferNet, we design two cycle-consistency loss functions to have an interactive training of InferNet over three series of datasets. To further enhance the performance of InferNet, we provide a joint training algorithm that simultaneously trains the pseudo-sample generator and InferNet, which significantly reduces the storage space. We evaluate the performance of InferNet on three datasets, and the intensive experiments demonstrate that InferNet can infer the original graph information from the graph embedding dataset with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of IoT devices has penetrated our daily life while posing new challenges in user authentication. Today’s solutions, e.g., passwords, fingerprints, and FaceIDs, primarily rely on specialized sensors or user interfaces to collect user’s identification information, which may not universally exist on heterogeneous IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a novel user authentication method that exploits the Electromagnetic (EM) emanations radiated from IoT devices. Our design is motivated by the observation that human touches on the IoT device can lead to time-varying coupling between these two. Consequently, it impacts the device’s EM emanations that can be picked up by its inertial ADC (analog-to-digital converter) interfaces. We ask the user to tap on the device rhythmically following a self-determined melody, such that the human-coupled EM emanations vary accordingly. We thus extract the rhythm pattern as the user’s secure password named EM-Rhythm . To examine its effectiveness, EM-Rhythm is implemented on a wide range of IoT devices. We show that our scheme achieves authentication accuracy as high as 98.67% with less than three login attempts. Besides, it is robust against various types of attacks and maintains stable performances under various settings. EM-Rhythm also exhibits satisfactory usability in terms of memorability and time consumption.",

    "abstract": "There has been considerable interest in distributed source coding (DSC) in recent years, primarily due to its potential contributions to low-power sensor networks. However, two major obstacles pose an existential threat to practical deployment of such techniques: the exponential growth of decoding complexity with network size and coding rates and the critical requirement of resilience to bit errors and erasures, given the severe channel conditions in many wireless sensor network applications. This article proposes a novel, unified approach for large-scale, error/erasure-resilient DSC that incorporates an optimally designed, nearest neighbor classifier-based decoding framework, where the design explicitly controls performance versus decoding complexity. Motivated by the highly nonconvex nature of the cost function, we present a deterministic annealing-based optimization algorithm for the joint design of the system parameters, which further enhances the performance over the greedy iterative descent technique. Simulation results on both synthetic and real sensor network data provide strong evidence for performance gains compared to other state-of-the-art techniques and may open the door to practical deployment of DSC in large sensor networks. Moreover, the framework provides a principled way to naturally scale to large networks while constraining decoder complexity, thereby enabling performance gains that increase with network size.",

We take a deterministic approach to contention resolution to achieve bounded latency on data transmissions while reducing the overhead. In addition to simplicity and small footprint, our approach requires fewer message exchanges compared to the state of the art. We then present a lightweight hybrid protocol that is seamlessly integrated with the proposed contention-resolution scheme, one better suited for delay-sensitive applications with real-time constraints by providing determinism. Another feature of the proposed protocol is that it requires carrier-sensing hardware only on the base station but not on the sensor nodes. The average probing complexity of our protocol in a highly dynamic network is O ( n /log n ) per round, and experimental results show the proposed scheme to be scalable and highly adaptive to the contention level.",

Radio-Frequency (RF)-based approaches are not suitable for some indoor environments such as factory floors where heavy machinery can cause interference. We propose a low-cost and simple location management system using infrared (IR) leds and the Wii Remote Controller (WRC) which has an IR camera. The proposed solution is motivated by the need to find the location of a mobile robot used for data collection in a wireless sensor network. In the proposed schemes, the WRC is placed vertically on the mobile robot pointing upward and IR leds are placed irregularly on the ceiling. The mobile robot determines its position using the relative positions of the IR leds detected by the WRC. The WRC senses a few IR leds at a time, and they are differentiated using the irregularity among them. We analyze the problem theoretically and show that there exist limitations for covering large areas. We also discuss how to overcome these limitations. For small coverage areas, we provide optimal solutions using linear programming. The proposed scheme uses the resources efficiently and can cover a large area using a single WRC and multiple IR leds. We have simulation results including nonvertical placements of the WRC. The proposed scheme is easy to implement and requires minimal bandwidth for location management.",

We develop a scalable deterministic distributed algorithm for maintaining a Steiner tree of the agents so that group communication between them can be provided with the minimum total cost possible. The main idea is that our algorithm maintains a virtual tree of mobile agents that can be immediately converted to an actual Steiner tree at all times. Our algorithm achieves the Steiner tree with total length at most O (log k ) times the length of the optimal Steiner tree in the constant-doubling graph model. The total communication cost (the number of messages) to maintain the Steiner tree is only O (min{log n , log D }) times the optimal communication cost, where n and D , respectively, are the number of nodes and the diameter of the constant-doubling network. We also develop improved algorithms for the mobile k -center, sparse-aggregation, and distributed-matching problems. Experimental evaluation results show the benefits of our algorithms compared to previous algorithms. These four problems are NP-hard and, to the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the first near-optimal deterministic algorithms for maintaining approximate solutions to these important network problems with low maintenance costs in a distributed setting.",

    "abstract": "The use of directional antennas for wireless communications brings several benefits, such as increased communication range and reduced interference. One example of directional antennas are electronically switched directional (ESD) antennas that can easily be integrated into Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) due to their small size and low cost. However, current literature questions the benefits of using ESD antennas in WSNs due to the increased likelihood of hidden terminals and increased power consumption. This is mainly because earlier studies have used directionality for transmissions but not for reception. In this article, we introduce novel cross-layer optimizations to fully utilize the benefits of using directional antennas. We modify the Medium Access Control (MAC) , routing, and neighbor discovery mechanisms to support directional communication. We focus on convergecast investigating a large number of different network topologies. Our experimental results, both in simulation and with real nodes, show when the traffic is dense, networks with directional antennas can significantly outperform networks with omnidirectional ones in terms of packet delivery rate, energy consumption, and energy per received packet.",

The area phenomenon is modeled to consist of K spatially distributed point phenomena. The activated sensors collect data samples characterizing the parameters of the involved point phenomena. They compress observed data readings and transport them to a processing center. The center processes the received data to derive estimates of the point phenomena's parameters. Our sensing stochastic process models account for distance-dependent observation noise perturbations as well as noise correlations. At the processing center, sample mean calculations are used to derive the estimates of the underlying area phenomenon's parameters. We develop computationally efficient algorithms to determine the specific set of sensors for activation under capacity and energy resource constraints so that a sufficiently low reproduction distortion level is attained. We derive lower bounds on the realizable levels of the distortion measure. Using illustrative cases, we demonstrate one of our algorithms to yield distortion levels that are very close to the lower bound, while other lower-complexity schemes often yield distortion levels relatively close to the lower bound.",

Property information is obtained via distributed sensor observations, but will be corrupted when objects mix up with each other. The association between properties and objects then becomes ambiguous. We build a novel representation framework, exploiting an overcomplete Radon basis dictionary to model property uncertainty in such circumstances. By making use of the combinatorial structure of the basis design and sparse representations we can efficiently approximate the underlying probability distribution of the association between target properties and tracks, overcoming the exponential space that would otherwise be required. Based on the proposed theories, we design a fully distributed algorithm on wireless sensor networks. We conduct comparative simulations and the results validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "To tap into the gold mine of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices with unprecedented volume and value, there is an urgent need to efficiently and accurately label raw sensor data. To this end, we explore and leverage the hidden connections among the multimodal data collected by various sensing devices and propose to let different modal data complement and learn from each other. But it is challenging to align and fuse multimodal data without knowing their perception (and thus the correct labels). In this work, we propose MultiSense , a paradigm for automatically mining potential perception, cross-labelling each modal data, and then updating the learning models for recognizing human activity to achieve higher accuracy or even recognize new activities. We design innovative solutions for segmenting, aligning, and fusing multimodal data from different sensors, as well as model updating mechanism. We implement our framework and conduct comprehensive evaluations on a rich set of data. Our results demonstrate that MultiSense significantly improves the data usability and the power of the learning models. With nine diverse activities performed by users, our framework automatically labels multimodal sensing data generated by five different sensing mechanisms (video, smart watch, smartphone, audio, and wireless-channel) with an average accuracy 98.5%. Furthermore, it enables models of some modalities to learn unknown activities from other modalities and greatly improves the activity recognition ability.",

Traditional charging schemes are only suitable for static sensors, while the issue of charging mobile sensors is ignored. In this paper, we make the first attempt to serve mobile sensors in the sensor-cloud systems in a “chasing” way, where a mobile charger can chase mobile sensors to replenish them. We formalize the charging utility MAximization Problem for dynamic sensors with a mobile charger (MAP) and propose a ChaseCharge algorithm based on RNN to solve it. Theoretical analyses are presented to explore the features of the proposed scheme.

    "abstract": "Of all indoor localization techniques, vision-based localization emerges as a promising one, mainly due to the ubiquity of rich visual features. Visual landmarks, which present distinguishing textures, play a fundamental role in visual indoor localization. However, few researches focus on visual landmark labeling. Preliminary arts usually designate a surveyor to select and record visual landmarks, which is tedious and time-consuming. Furthermore, due to structural changes (e.g., renovation), the visual landmark database may be outdated, leading to degraded localization accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose VILL , a user-friendly, efficient, and accurate approach for visual landmark labeling. VILL asks a user to sweep the camera to take a video clip of his/her surroundings. In the construction stage, VILL identifies unlabeled visual landmarks from videos adaptively according to the graph-based visual correlation representation. Based on the spatial correlations with selected anchor landmarks, VILL estimates locations of unlabeled ones on the floorplan accurately. In the update stage, VILL formulates an alteration identification model based on the judgments from different users to identify altered landmarks accurately. Extensive experimental results in two different trial sites show that VILL reduces the site survey substantially (by at least 65.9%) and achieves comparable accuracy.",

Correctly and accurately estimating the real situation of the smart grid under false data injections attacks (FDIAs) gains an emerging concern nowadays. In response to this concern, this work proposes a distributed robust learning framework for the inference of the working situation under data integrity attacks. The proposed paradigm incorporates the technology median-of-means that enables identifying the correct state against various kinds of FDIAs that can efficiently prevent misleading during the decision-making process in control centers. Compared to existing defending methods, our method is entirely data-driven without training data, highly accurate and reliable for wide-spectrum FDIAs, and more importantly, capable of large-scale power electronic networks due to the distributed learning framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can provide efficient protection for PV systems from FDIAs.",

    "abstract": "In industrial production, the orientation of facility components can indicate whether the facility is on a regular operating track. For example, when a component gets loose, the orientation variation of the component would exceed the normal range. A common approach for orientation measurement is to attach an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the target device. However, the IMU requires additional power maintenance. This article presents LightGyro, a cheap and efficient batteryless scheme to measure the orientation, in which we attach a reflective film to the target device and use a camera to capture the light spot on the reflective film. The basic idea of LightGyro is to extract the light spots in the captured frame and use their pixel coordinates to infer the orientation. It is difficult to recognize a single light spot, because the spot lacks distinctive features. To solve the problem, we switch light sources on and off to regulate the appearance of light spots and utilize frame subtraction to extract light spots. The depth of field of light spot is lost in the process of camera projection, which is necessary for the orientation measurement. To address the issue, we propose a light array-based reflection model to extract the depth of field from the relative positions of multiple light spots. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize reflection to measure orientation. Experiment results show that the orientation error of LightGyro decreases with the increasing length of the reflection route and the orientation error can achieve less than 1 ˆ .",

    "abstract": "Retrieving similar trajectories aims to search for the trajectories that are close to a query trajectory in spatio-temporal domain from a large trajectory dataset. This is critical for a variety of applications, like transportation planning and mobility analysis. Unlike previous studies that perform similar trajectory retrieval on fine-grained GPS data or single cellular carrier, we investigate the feasibility of finding similar trajectories from cellular data of multiple carriers, which provide more comprehensive coverage of population and space. To handle the issues of spatial bias of cellular data from multiple carriers, coarse spatial granularity, and irregular sparse temporal sampling, we develop a holistic system cellSim . Specifically, to avoid the issue of spatial bias, we first propose a novel map matching approach, which transforms the cell tower sequences from multiple carriers to routes on a unified road map. Then, to address the issue of temporal sparse sampling, we generate multiple routes with different confidences to increase the probability of finding truly similar trajectories. Finally, a new trajectory similarity measure is developed for similar trajectory search by calculating the similarities between the irregularly-sampled trajectories. Extensive experiments on a large-scale cellular dataset from two carriers and real-world 1,701 km query trajectories reveal that cellSim provides state-of-the-art performance for similar trajectory retrieval.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth in the world population, developing agricultural technologies has been an urgent need. Sensor networks have been widely used to monitor and manage agricultural status. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are adopted for their high accuracy to enable the analysis of massive data collected through the sensor network. The datasets on the devices of agricultural applications usually need to be completed and bigger, which limits the performance of AI algorithms. Thus, researchers turn to Collaborative Learning (CL) to utilize the data on multiple devices to train a global model privately. However, current CL frameworks for agricultural applications suffer from three problems: data heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, and communication overhead. In this paper, we propose cloud-based Collaborative Agricultural Learning with Flexible model size and Adaptive batch number (CALFA) to improve the efficiency and applicability of the training process while maintaining its effectiveness. CALFA contains three modules. The Classification Pyramid allows the devices to use different sizes of models during training and enables the classification of different object sizes. Adaptive Aggregation modifies the aggregation weights to maintain the convergence speed and accuracy. Adaptive Adjustment modifies the training batch numbers to mitigate the communication overhead. The experimental results illustrate that CALFA outperforms other SOTA CL frameworks by reducing up to 75% communication overhead with nearly no accuracy loss. Also, CALFA enables training on more devices by reducing the model size.",

Specifically, we assign different attentions on sub-carriers, which are then compressed to reduce noise and information redundancy. Then, LiteWiSys integrates deep separable convolution and a channel shuffle mechanism into a multi-scale convolutional backbone structure. By feature channel split, two network branches are obtained and further trained with a joint loss function for dual tasks. We collect different datasets at multi-scenes and conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of LiteWiSys.

Recently, there has been an increased salinization problem of surface water in many regions of the world, making it necessary to timely monitor the salinity of surface water. Water salinity sensing could be challenging when it comes to surface water with complicated basin and tributaries, where existing methods fail to satisfy both efficiency and accuracy requirements. To address this problem, we propose a novel water salinity sensing system USalt, which leverages the high mobility of UAV and the contactless sensing ability of IR-UWB radar, and realizes fast and accurate water salinity sensing for surface water. Specifically, we design novel methods to eliminate the contamination in raw received radar signals and extract salinity-related features from radar signals. Furthermore, we adopt a neural network model ssNet to precisely estimate water salinity using the extracted features. To efficiently adapt ssNet to different environments, we customize meta learning and design a meta-learning framework mssNet. Extensive real-world experiments carried out by our UAV-based system illustrate that USalt can accurately sense the salinity of water with an MAE of 0.39 g/100 mL.",

MagEar outperforms some high-precision magnetometers in detecting magnetic fields at the nanotesla level. Even at a distance of 60 cm, it can recover high-quality audio with a 90% similarity to the original audio. Moreover, the MagEar prototype is portable and can be concealed within a headset housing. We have implemented MagEar as a proof-of-concept system and conducted multiple case studies on the eavesdropping of various speaker-embedded devices, including earphones. The recovered speech can be transcribed using automatic speech recognition techniques, even when obstructed by soundproof walls.

    "abstract": "Wireless energy transfer has recently emerged as a promising alternative to realize the vision of perpetual embedded sensing. However, this technology transforms the notion of energy from merely a node’s local commodity to, similarly to data, a deployment-wide shareable resource. The challenges of managing a shareable energy resource are much more complicated and radically different from the research of the past decade: Besides energy-efficient operation of individual devices, we also need to optimize networkwide energy distribution. To counteract these challenges, we propose an energy stack , a layered software model for energy management in future transiently powered embedded networks. An initial specification of the energy stack, which is based on the historically successful layered approach for data networking, consists of three layers: (i) the transfer layer, which deals with the physical transfer of energy; (ii) the scheduling layer, which optimizes energy distribution over a single hop; and (iii) the network layer, creates a global view of the energy in the network for optimizing its networkwide distribution. As a contribution, we define the interfacing APIs between these layers, delineate their responsibilities, identify corresponding challenges, and provide a first implementation of the energy stack. Our evaluation, using both experimental deployments and high-level simulations, establishes the feasibility of a layered solution to energy management under transient power.",

It can estimate the size of objects that could be large in size and not directly touchable by the user. Such a design will enable a rich set of applications that count on the size information of surrounding environments/objects. Aware purely utilizes the motion sensors on the device for object size measures. It can also integrate with the crowdsourcing feature for both performance improvement and result sharing. We propose a series of key techniques to address three major challenges in the Aware design: (1) user’s angle of line-of-sights to the object is used in the size measure but motion sensors track only the angle of arm’s waving, (2) motion sensors are noisy that require novel and effective data processing techniques, otherwise the errors could easily overwhelm the final result, and (3) in the crowdsourcing mode, Aware needs to identify vicinal objects of similar sizes and effectively fuse the measured sizes that correspond to the same object. We consolidate the above designs and implement Aware on Android platforms. Extensive experiments with four users show that Aware can achieve accurate measurement performance for the objects of various sizes in both indoor and outdoor environments.",

    "abstract": "For energy constraint wireless IoT nodes, their radios usually operate in duty cycle mode. With low maintenance and negotiation cost, asynchronous duty cycle radio management is widely adopted. To achieve fast network flooding is challenging in asynchronous duty cycle networks. Recently, concurrent flooding, which allows a set of nodes (called concurrent senders ) to immediately broadcast the received packet without any backoff, is a promising approach to improve the flooding speed. We observe that selecting either large or small number of concurrent senders cannot achieve the optimal flooding speed in different deployments. There is a tradeoff between the degradation of concurrent broadcast efficiency and the missing of early receiving chance. In this article, we propose COFlood (Concurrent Opportunistic Flooding), a practical and efficient concurrent flooding protocol in asynchronous duty cycle networks. First, COFlood constructs a concurrent flooding tree in distributed manner. The non-leaf nodes are selected as concurrent senders and they can cover the entire network while reserving the most capacity of concurrent broadcast for later added opportunistic concurrent senders. Moreover, we find that exploiting both early wake-up nodes and long lossy links can speed up the concurrent flooding tree-based network flooding by increasing the early receiving chances. Then, COFlood develops a lightweight method to select the nodes that meet the conditions of these two opportunities as opportunistic concurrent senders. We implement COFlood in TinyOS and evaluate it on two real testbeds. In comparison with state-of-the-art concurrent flooding protocol, completion time and energy consumption can be reduced by up to 35.3% and 26.6%.",

    "abstract": "Spectrum sensing has a very important role in the operation of cognitive radio network. A proper sensing and utilization improve the performance of cognitive radio network (CRN). Different methodologies were developed in past to improve the sensing and utilization performance in CRN. Parallel sensing is used as an optimal approach in spectrum sensing with reduced delay of operation but restraint with multiple requests for spectrum sensing. A random generation of sensing requests results in large time delay and interference in the network. To minimize the interference effect and requesting overhead, this paper presents a new approach of spectrum sensing by centralized monitoring of spectrum engagement of Primary User (PU). The proposed approach operates on a repository monitoring of channel engagement to control the request granting for spectrum sensing in PUs. In addition, the sharing of spectrum usage is controlled by monitoring the spectral efficiency and interference in the network. Simulation results obtained illustrates an enhancement in network throughput, spectrum sensing and spectrum utilization performance where an average network throughput is observed to improve by 80% for varying number of primary channels and varying load conditions. The spectrum sensing is improved by 70% in average for varying primary channels and load conditions and Ideal channel utilization for the proposed approach is observed to improve by 90%.",

    "abstract": "We investigate an understudied threat: networks of stealthy routers (S-Routers) , relaying messages to a hidden destination . The S-Routers relay communication along a path of multiple short-range, low-energy hops, to avoid remote localization by triangulation. Mobile devices called Interceptors can detect communication by an S-Router, but only when the Interceptor is next to the transmitting S-Router. We examine algorithms for a set of mobile Interceptors to find the destination of the communication relayed by the S-Routers. The algorithms are compared according to the number of communicating rounds before the destination is found, i.e., rounds in which data is transmitted from the source to the destination . We evaluate the algorithms analytically and using simulations, including against a parametric, optimized strategy for the S-Routers. Our main result is an Interceptors algorithm that bounds the expected number of communicating rounds by a term quasilinear in the number of S-Routers. For the case where S-Routers transmit at every round (“continuously”), we present an algorithm that improves this bound.",

    "abstract": "To build a secure wireless networking system, it is essential that the cryptographic key is known only to the two (or more) communicating parties. Existing key extraction schemes put the devices into physical proximity and utilize the common inherent randomness between the devices to agree on a secret key, but they often rely on specialized hardware (e.g., the specific wireless NIC model) and have low bit rates. In this article, we seek a key extraction approach that only leverages off-the-shelf mobile devices, while achieving significantly higher key generation efficiency. The core idea of our approach is to exploit the fast varying inaudible acoustic channel as the common random source for key generation and wireless parallel communication for exchanging reconciliation information to improve the key generation rate. We have carefully studied and validated the feasibility of our approach through both theoretical analysis and a variety of measurements. We implement our approach on different mobile devices and conduct extensive experiments in different real scenarios. The experiment results show that our approach achieves high efficiency and satisfactory robustness. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach improves the key generation rate by 38.46% and reduces the bit mismatch ratio by 42.34%.",
