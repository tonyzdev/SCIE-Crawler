We provide a complete solution to this subproblem by showing that there are precisely two limit varieties that satisfy this identity.

The set S is called gcd-closed if (x i ,x j ) ∈ S for 1≤ i, j≤ n. Hong in 2004 showed that if the set S is gcd-closed such that every element of S has at most two distinct prime factors, then the power LCM matrix on S is nonsingular. In this paper, we use Hong's method developed in his previous papers to consider the next case. We prove that if every element of an arbitrary gcd-closed set S is of the form pqr, or p 2 qr, or p 3 qr, where p, q and r are distinct primes, then except for the case e=1 and 270, 520 ∈ S, the power LCM matrix on S is nonsingular. We also show that if S is a gcd-closed set satisfying x i &lt; 180 for all 1≤ i≤ n, then the power LCM matrix on S is nonsingular. This proves that 180 is the least primitive singular number.

It is shown that whenever R ⊆ T are rings such that there exists a maximal subring V of T, which is integrally closed in T and U(R) ⊈ V, then R has a maximal subring. In particular, it is proved that if R is algebraic over ℤ and there exists a natural number n &gt; 1 with n ∈ U(R), then R has a maximal subring. It is shown that if R is an infinite direct product of certain fields, then the maximal ideals M for which R M (R/M) has maximal subrings are characterized. It is observed that if R is a ring, then either R has a maximal subring or it must be a Hilbert ring. In particular, every reduced ring R with |R|&gt;2 2 ℵ 0 or J(R) ≠ 0 has a maximal subring. Finally, the semi-local rings having maximal subrings are fully characterized.",

We also show that (as in the case of Gorenstein flat modules) every Gorenstein AC-flat module is a direct summand of a strongly Gorenstein AC-flat module. When R is such that the class of Gorenstein AC-flat modules is closed under extensions, the converse is also true.

In effect, we prove that this theorem follows from establishing a sequence of equalities between specific classes of R-modules. Actually, we tackle the following natural question: What notion emerges when iterating the very process applied to build the Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective modules from complete resolutions? In other words, given an exact sequence of Gorenstein injective R-modules G= ⋯ → G 1 → G 0 → G -1 → ⋯ such that the complex Hom R (H,G) is exact for each Gorenstein injective R-module H, is the module Im (G 0 → G -1 ) Gorenstein injective? We settle such a question in the affirmative and the dual result for the Gorenstein projective modules follows easily via a similar treatment to that used in this paper. As an application, we provide the Gorenstein versions of the change of rings theorems for injective modules over an arbitrary ring.",

Equivalently, R is a left AIP-ring if R modulo the left annihilator of any ideal is flat. This class of rings includes both right PP-rings and right p.q.-Baer rings (and hence the biregular rings) and is closed under direct products and forming upper triangular matrix rings. It is shown that, unlike the Baer or right PP conditions, the AIP property is inherited by polynomial extensions and has the advantage that it is a Morita invariant property. We also give a complete characterization of a class of AIP-rings which have a sheaf representation. Connections to related classes of rings are investigated and several examples and counterexamples are included to illustrate and delimit the theory.",

In [5], Huppert verified the conjecture for the simple alternating groups A n of degree up to 11. In this paper, we continue his work and verify the conjecture for the alternating groups of degrees 12 and 13.",

We show that the latter endomorphism maps other square-free polynomials to square-free polynomials as well. In connection with the above classification of invertible polynomial maps and the Jacobian Conjecture, we study irreducibility properties of several types of Keller maps, to each of which the Jacobian Conjecture can be reduced. Herewith, we generalize the result of Bakalarski that the components of cubic homogeneous Keller maps with a symmetric Jacobian matrix (over ℂ and hence any field of characteristic zero) are irreducible. Furthermore, we show that the Jacobian Conjecture can even be reduced to any of these types with the extra condition that each affinely linear combination of the components of the polynomial map is irreducible. This is somewhat similar to reducing the planar Jacobian Conjecture to the so-called (planar) weak Jacobian Conjecture by Kaliman.",

In this paper, we investigate the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of a finitely generated module over a differential difference algebra through a computational method: Gröbner-Shirshov basis method. We develop the Gröbner-Shirshov basis theory of differential difference algebras, and of finitely generated modules over differential difference algebras, respectively. Then, via Gröbner-Shirshov bases, we give algorithms for computing the Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions of cyclic modules and finitely generated modules over differential difference algebras.",

In particular, the coboundary bialgebra theory leads to the system of associative Yang–Baxter equations in compatible associative algebras, which is an analogue of the classical Yang–Baxter equation in a Lie algebra. Furthermore, the bialgebra can also be regarded as a “compatible version” of antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras, that is, a pair of antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras satisfying any linear combination of them is still an antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebra.",

    "abstract": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $ 1 \\neq 0$. We recall that a proper ideal $I$ of $R$ is called a semiprimary ideal of $R$ if whenever $a,b\\in R$ and $ab \\in I$, then $a\\in \\sqrt{I}$ or $b\\in \\sqrt{I}$. We say $I$ is a {\\it weakly semiprimary ideal} of $R$ if whenever $a,b\\in R$ and $0 \\not = ab \\in I$, then $a\\in \\sqrt{I}$ or $b\\in \\sqrt{I}$. In this paper, we introduce a new class of ideals that is closely related to the class of (weakly) semiprimary ideals. Let $I(R)$ be the set of all ideals of $R$ and let $\\delta: I(R) \\rightarrow I(R)$ be a function. Then $\\delta$ is called an expansion function of ideals of $R$ if whenever $L, I, J$ are ideals of $R$ with $J \\subseteq I$, then $L \\subseteq \\delta(L)$ and $\\delta(J) \\subseteq \\delta(I)$. Let $\\delta$ be an expansion function of ideals of $R$. Then a proper ideal $I$ of $R$ (i.e., $I \\not = R$) is called a ({\\it $\\delta$-semiprimary}) {\\it weakly $\\delta$-semiprimary} ideal of $R$ if ($ab \\in I$) $0 \\not = ab \\in I$ implies $a \\in \\delta(I)$ or $b \\in \\delta(I)$. For example, let $\\delta: I(R) \\rightarrow I(R)$ such that $\\delta(I) = \\sqrt{I}$. Then $\\delta$ is an expansion function of ideals of $R$ and hence a proper ideal $I$ of $R$ is a ($\\delta$-semiprimary) weakly $\\delta$-semiprimary ideal of $R$ if and only if $I$ is a (semiprimary) weakly semiprimary ideal of $R$. A number of results concerning weakly $\\delta$-semiprimary ideals and examples of weakly $\\delta$-semiprimary ideals are given.",

We prove a fundamental theorem which states that if A is a (left) upper B-periodic subset of a semigroup S, then under some conditions, it has a unique direct representation [Formula: see text], where B 1 =B ∪ {1} and B ⊆ 𝔅 ≤ S. Especially, we prove a unique direct representation for upper and lower T-periodic subsets, and classify all sub-semigroups of S containing a fixed element T to three classes. This classification gives us more interesting properties for the real semigroups. At last, we characterize upper and lower T-periodic subsets of semigroups and groups.",

In 2002 Carles Broto, Ran Levi and Bob Oliver formulate the existence and the uniqueness of the category ℒ sc in terms of the annulation of an obstruction 3 -cohomology element and of the vanishing of a 2-cohomology group, and they state a sufficient condition for the vanishing of these n-cohomology groups. Recently, Andrew Chermak has proved the existence and the uniqueness of ℒ sc via his objective partial groups, and Bob Oliver, following some of Chermak's methods, has also proved the vanishing of those n-cohomology groups for n &gt; 1, both applying the Classification of the finite simple groups. Here we give direct proofs of the existence and the uniqueness of ℒ sc ; moreover, in [11] we already show that ℒ sc can be completed in a suitable category ℒ extending ℱ and we also prove some functoriality of this correspondence.",

The links between these two algebraic concepts are presented, with the aim of reviving the old notion of an [Formula: see text]-group in the current research on algebraic hyperstructures.

    "abstract": "Let N be a homomorphically closed class of associative rings. Put N1 = N 1 = N and for ordinals α ≥ 2, define Nα, (Nα) to be the class of all associative rings R such that every non-zero homomorphic image of R contains a non-zero ideal (left ideal) in Nβ for some β < α. In this way we obtain a chain {Nα} ({Nα}), the union of which is equal to the lower radical class lN (lower left strong radical class lsN ) determined by N . The chain {Nα} is called Kurosh’s chain of N . In [11] Sulinski, Anderson and Divinsky studied the Kurosh’s chain in the universal class of associative rings. They described the classes Nα in terms of accessible subrings and proved that the chain stabilizes at the first limit ordinal ω. They asked whether, for each ordinal α ≤ ω, there exists a class N such that lN = Nα 6= Nβ for β < α. The question turned out to be very interesting and challenging. In [7], Heinicke answered it in the positive for α = ω. However, the problem for positive integers resisted effords of many authors for a long time. Various studies, except some general results, effected in solving the problem for small integers and determining when the chain stabilizes for some specific classes N . The general problem was finally solved in the positive by Beidar in [3]. After that, several new examples were found (see [1], [4], [9], [1! 0], [12]). All of them were not easy to handle and required quite complicated arguments. Developing some ideas of the mentioned papers (mainly those of [10]), we construct new general examples. The generality allows us to avoid particular calculations which, we hope, makes the arguments clearer and more visible. It also allows us to construct radicals which satisfy some extra properties.

They amount to a tower of differential and difference equations for the coefficients of these perturbed matrices. The equations of the hierarchy are conveniently formulated in so-called Lax equations for these perturbations. They possess a minimal realization for which it is shown that the relevant evolutions of the perturbation commute. These Lax equations are shown in a purely algebraic way to be equivalent with zero curvature equations for a collection of finite band matrices, that are the components of a formal connection form. One concludes with the linearization of the hierarchies and the notion of wave matrices at zero, which is the algebraic substitute for a basis of the horizontal sections of the formal connection corresponding to this connection form.",

Ono proved that there are infinitely many square-free integers d ≡ r (mod 24) such that rank [Formula: see text], using the theory of modular forms. In this paper, we use the class number of quadratic field and Pell equation to describe these square-free integers k such that E(k 3 )(ℚ) has rank zero.",

Our construction is a generalization to arbitrary dimension of the one recently given by Cristofori and Mulazzani in dimension three, and it is dual to the one given by Pezzana in the 1970s. In this context we establish some results concerning the topology of the represented manifolds: suspensions, fundamental groups, connected sums and moves between graphs representing the same manifold. Classification results of compact orientable 4-manifolds representable by graphs up to six vertices are obtained, together with some properties of the G-degree of 5-colored graphs relating this approach to tensor models theory.",

One can get the relative derived category [Formula: see text] of A-mod. For an F-self-orthogonal module T F , we discuss the relation between the relative quotient triangulated category [Formula: see text] and the relative stable category of the Frobenius category of T F -Cohen-Macaulay modules. In particular, for an F-Gorenstein algebra A and an F-tilting A-module T F , we get a triangle equivalence between [Formula: see text] and the relative stable category of T F -Cohen-Macaulay modules.

Then there is a natural embedding of End N (M N ) into End G (M G ). By taking H to be a p-subgroup of G, we can reformulate Green's theory on modular representation. A defect theory is defined on the endomorphism ring of any induced module and it is used to prove Green's correspondence and related results. This defect theory can unify some well known results in modular representation theory. By using generalized Schur's lemma, we can also give a method to determine the multiplicity of simple modules in any permutation module of symmetric groups. This makes it possible to prove various versions of Foulkes' conjecture in a uniform way.",

(2) Each annihilator ideal of irreducible [Formula: see text]-modules of maximal dimension is generated by the corresponding central character ideal in [Formula: see text]. (3) Each G-stable ideal in [Formula: see text] for [Formula: see text] contains nonzero fixed points under the action of G, where G is a connected reductive algebraic group. Additionally, the arguments on ideals help us to give an alternative description of the Azumaya locus in the Zassenhaus variety without using the normality of the Zassenhaus variety.",

But this refinement is formulated in terms of a vanishing alternating sum, without giving any possible refinement for the weights. In this note we show that, in the case of the p-solvable finite groups, the method developed in a previous paper can be suitably refined to provide, up to the choice of a polarization ω, a natural bijection — namely compatible with the action of the group of outer automorphisms of G — between the sets of absolutely irreducible characters of G and of G-conjugacy classes of suitable inductive weights, preserving blocks and defects.",

Here we come to the notion of weak equivalence of gradings: two gradings are weakly equivalent if there exists an isomorphism between the graded algebras that maps each graded component onto a graded component. Each group grading on an algebra can be weakly equivalent to G-gradings for many different groups G; however, it turns out that there is one distinguished group among them, called the universal group of the grading. In this paper we study categories and functors related to the notion of weak equivalence of gradings. In particular, we introduce an oplax 2-functor that assigns to each grading its support, and show that the universal grading group functor has neither left nor right adjoint.",

For this reason, there is interest in studying the semigroup or monoid properties of Hyp (τ) and its submonoids. One approach is to study the five relations known as Green's relations definable on any semigroup. In this paper, we consider the type τ = (n) with one n-ary operation symbol for n≥ 1, and the submonoid Reg (n) of regular hypersubstitutions. We characterize Green's relations on every subsemigroup of Reg (n); then using this characterization we describe which subsemigroups of Reg (n) are 𝒢-subsemigroups of Reg (n) defined by Levi.",

We show that this notion is also related to Yang-Baxter pairs and to matching pre-Lie algebras. We then modify the definition of matching Rota-Baxter systems by adding a curvature term, and make a connection with matching pre-Lie algebras and with compatible associative algebras. Furthermore, we study matching Rota-Baxter systems on a dendriform algebra and show how they induce matching quadri-algebra structures. Finally, we give a linear basis of free matching Rota-Baxter system by Gröbner-Shirshov bases methods.",

These attract a lot of interest in mathematics and physics since they can be identified with so-called BPS states. Another motivation is the work of Dimitrov et al. on the phases of stable representations of the generalized Kronecker quiver. One aim is to explain for general Euclidean and wild quivers the behavior of phases of stable representations well known in some examples. In addition, we study especially the behavior of preinjective, postprojective and regular indecomposable modules. We show that the existence of a stable representation with self-extensions implies the existence of infinitely many stables without self-extensions for rigid central charges. In this case the phases of the stable representations approach one or two limit points. In particular, the phases are not dense in two arcs. The category of representations of acyclic quivers is a special case of rigid Abelian categories which show this behavior for rigid central charges.",

Of these, only the lexicographic and bootlace orders yield residuated semigroups. With the lexicographic order, S x is orthodox and has a biggest idempotent. With the bootlace order, the maximal idempotents of S x are identified by specific locations in the sandwich matrix. In the orthodox case there is also a biggest idempotent and, for sandwich matrices of a given size, uniqueness up to ordered semigroup isomorphism is established.",

Usually we use the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) algorithm in the decoding process of Reed–Solomon codes. MLD algorithm relies on determining the error distance of received word. Dür, Guruswami, Wan, Li, Hong, Wu, Yue and Zhu et al. got some results on the error distance. For the Reed–Solomon code [Formula: see text], the received word [Formula: see text] is called an ordinary word of [Formula: see text] if the error distance [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text] being the Lagrange interpolation polynomial of [Formula: see text]. We introduce a new method of studying the ordinary words. In fact, we make use of the result obtained by Y.C. Xu and S.F. Hong on the decomposition of certain polynomials over the finite field to determine all the ordinary words of the standard Reed–Solomon codes over the finite field of [Formula: see text] elements. This completely answers an open problem raised by Li and Wan in [On the subset sum problem over finite fields, Finite Fields Appl. 14 (2008) 911–929].",

Using a Gröbner basis for this ideal, it is shown that the initial ideal of a generic pluri-circulant matrix is a stable monomial ideal when the matrix has two square blocks. By means of the Eliahou-Kervaire resolution for stable monomial ideals, the Betti numbers of this initial ideal is computed and it is proved that for some significant values of t, this ideal has the same Betti numbers as the corresponding transversal monomial ideal.

Thirty years ago, Tetsuro Okuyama already proved that in the class of p-solvable groups this conjecture holds. In this paper, for the p-solvable groups, on the one hand we exhibit a natural bijection — namely compatible with the action of the group of outer automorphisms of G — between the sets of isomorphism classes of simple kG-modules M and of G-conjugacy classes of weights (R,Y), up to the choice of a polarization. On the other hand, we determine the relationship between a multiplicity module of M and Y. In an Appendix, we show that the bijection defined by Gabriel Navarro for the groups of odd order coincides with our bijection for a particular choice of the polarization.",

It is based on the notion of a retraction and some system of mappings. A mapping extension of a given algebra is constructed as a counterimage algebra by a specially defined retraction. Varieties of algebras satisfying an identity φ(x) ≈ x for a term φ not being a variable (such as varieties of lattices, Boolean algebras, groups and rings) are especially interesting because for such a variety [Formula: see text], all mapping extensions by φ of algebras from [Formula: see text] form an equational class. In the last section, combinatorial properties of the mapping extension construction are considered.",

The interpretation in terms of homogeneous spaces of unitary groups is also discussed.",

Using [Formula: see text]-complete functors, we assign a new homological invariant to any finitely generated module over an arbitrary commutative noetherian local ring, that would generalize Auslander's delta invariant. We generalize the results about the δ-invariant to arbitrary rings and give a sufficient condition for the vanishing of this new invariant. We also introduce an analogue of the notion of the index of a Gorenstein local ring, introduced by Auslander, for arbitrary local rings and study its behavior under flat extensions of local rings. Finally, we study the connection between the index and Loewy length of a local ring and generalize the main result of [11] to arbitrary rings.",

In this paper, we first prove that for any ring R ∈ GAERS-1 and any ideal I of R, K 0 (R/I) is an archimedean ℓ-group, which is a natural generalization of [10, Theorem 5.3]. As applications, we establish explicit characterizations for the K 0 -simplicity of such rings in the sense of [3], and investigate the norm completeness of their K 0 -groups. Finally, we characterize the primitive idempotents in R by K 0 (R) with ordered structure, from which we can further determine completely the structure of K 0 (R).",

In this paper, enrichments in a monoidal category are generalized to arbitrary categories. These specialize to the classical enrichments when sets are regraded as discrete categories. We also generalize the definitions of PROs and PROPs as some generalized enrichments of categories. Then an operad in some monoidal category corresponds to a generalized PROP. Algebras of operads induce some special kind of monoidal functors. In the category of small categories, we construct several operads to define lax monoids and lax commutative monoids which are formal descriptions of natural associativity and commutativity. Using this identification, operads and their algebras can be studied by lax commutative monoids and morphisms between them.",

In this paper, we provide a practical method of constructing such a strong semilattice of mplicative semigroups.

A natural question is what kind of polynomials in E 4 (z) and Δ 24 (z) could be the theta series of positive definite even unimodular lattices. In this paper, we find two combinatorial identities on the theta series of the root lattices of the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras of type D 4n and the cosets in their integral duals, in terms of E 4 (z) and Δ 24 (z). Using these two identities, we prove that three families of weighted symmetric polynomials of two fixed families of polynomials of E 4 (z) and Δ 24 (z) are the theta series of certain positive definite even unimodular lattices, obtained by gluing finitely many copies of the root lattices of the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras of type D 2n . The results also show that the full permutation groups are the hidden symmetry of the theta series of certain unimodular lattices.",

We present a great source of examples of these morphisms proving that, under some assumption, a functor between small categories induces a morphism of this kind between the natural weak multiplier bialgebra structures carried by the linear spans of the arrow sets of the categories. We explore the notion of elements of group-like type in a weak multiplier bialgebra, proposing a definition in the line of the one by the aforementioned authors for weak bialgebras. We show a big number of its properties and provide more general versions of many results known in the context of weak bialgebras.

This means that [Formula: see text] has anticonformal automorphisms, but none of them is an involution. A Riemann surface is said to be plane if it can be described by a smooth plane model of some degree d ≥ 4 in [Formula: see text]. We characterize pseudo-real-plane Riemann surfaces [Formula: see text], whose conformal automorphism group Aut + ([Formula: see text]) is PGL 3 (ℂ)-conjugate to a finite non-trivial group that leaves invariant infinitely many points of [Formula: see text]. In particular, we show that such pseudo-real-plane Riemann surfaces exist only if Aut + ([Formula: see text]) is cyclic of even order n dividing the degree d. Explicit families of pseudo-real-plane Riemann surfaces are given for any degree d = 2pm with m &gt; 1 odd, p prime and n = d/p.",

Recently, some authors have been interested in relative homological dimensions defined by just exact sequences. In this paper, we contribute to the investigation of these relative homological dimensions. First we study the relation between these two kinds of relative homological dimensions and establish some transfer results under adjoint pairs. Then relative global dimensions are studied, which lead to nice characterizations of some properties of particular cases of self-orthogonal subcategories. At the end of this paper, relative derived functors are studied and generalizations of some known results of balance for relative homology are established.",

    "abstract": "For every simple graph [Formula: see text], a class of multiple clique cluster-whiskered graphs [Formula: see text] is introduced, and it is shown that all such graphs are vertex decomposable; thus, the independence simplicial complex [Formula: see text] is sequentially Cohen–Macaulay. The properties of the graphs [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] constructed by Cook and Nagel are studied, including the enumeration of facets of the complex [Formula: see text] and the calculation of Betti numbers of the cover ideal [Formula: see text]. We also prove that the complex[Formula: see text] is strongly shellable and pure for either a Boolean graph [Formula: see text] or the full clique-whiskered graph [Formula: see text] of [Formula: see text], which is obtained by adding a whisker to each vertex of [Formula: see text]. This implies that both the facet ideal [Formula: see text] and the cover ideal [Formula: see text] have linear quotients.",
