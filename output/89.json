    "abstract": "The distribution in angle and flux of gamma-ray bursts indicates that the majority of gamma-ray bursters are at cosmological distances, i.e., at z of about 1. The rate is then about 10 exp -8/yr in a galaxy like the Milky Way, i.e., orders of magnitude lower than the estimated rate for collisions between neutron stars in close binary systems. The energy per burst is about 10 exp 51 ergs, assuming isotropic emission. The events appear to be less energetic and more frequent if their emission is strongly beamed. Some tests for the distance scale are discussed: a correlation between the burst's strength and its spectrum; the absorption by the Galactic gas below about 2 keV; the X-ray tails caused by forward scattering by the Galactic dust; about 1 month recurrence of some bursts caused by gravitational lensing by foreground galaxies; and a search for gamma-ray bursts in M31. The bursts appear to be a manifestation of something exotic, but conventional compact objects can provide an explanation. The best possibility is offered by a decay of a bindary composed of a spinning-stellar-mass black-hole primary and a neutron or a strange-quark star secondary. In the final phase the secondary is tidally disrupted, forms an accretion disk, and up to 10 exp 54 ergs are released. A very small fraction of this energy powers the gamma-ray burst.",

    "abstract": "We present both the technical overview and main science drivers of the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (hereafter OGLE-IV). OGLE-IV is currently one of the largest sky variability surveys worldwide, targeting the densest stellar regions of the sky. The survey covers over 3000 square degrees in the sky and monitors regularly over a billion sources. \r\nThe main targets include the inner Galactic Bulge and the Magellanic System. Their photometry spans the range of $12<I<21$ mag and $13<I<21.7$ mag, respectively. Supplementary shallower Galaxy Variability Survey covers the extended Galactic bulge and 2/3 of the whole Galactic disk within the magnitude range of $10<I<19$ mag. All OGLE-IV surveys provide photometry with milli-magnitude accuracy at the bright end. The cadence of observations varies from 19-60 minutes in the inner Galactic bulge to 1-3 days in the remaining Galactic bulge fields, Magellanic System and the Galactic disk. \r\nOGLE-IV provides the astronomical community with a number of real time services. The Early Warning System (EWS) contains information on two thousand gravitational microlensing events being discovered in real time annually, the OGLE Transient Detection System (OTDS) delivers over 200 supernovae a year. We also provide the real time photometry of unpredictable variables such as optical counterparts to the X-ray sources and R CrB stars. \r\nHundreds of thousands new variable stars have already been discovered and classified by the OGLE survey. The number of new detections will be at least doubled during the current OGLE-IV phase. The survey was designed and optimized primarily to conduct the second generation microlensing survey for exoplanets. It has already contributed significantly to the increase of the discovery rate of microlensing exoplanets and free-floating planets.",

    "abstract": "We present a three-dimensional analysis of a sample of 22 859 type $ab$ RR Lyrae stars in the Magellanic System from the OGLE-IV Collection of RR Lyrae stars. The distance to each object was calculated based on its photometric metallicity and a theoretical relation between color, absolute magnitude and metallicity. The LMC RR Lyrae distribution is very regular and does not show any substructures. We demonstrate that the bar found in previous studies may be an overdensity caused by blending and crowding effects. The halo is asymmetrical with a higher stellar density in its north-eastern area, which is also located closer to us. Triaxial ellipsoids were fitted to surfaces of a constant number density. Ellipsoids farther from the LMC center are less elongated and slightly rotated toward the SMC. The inclination and position angle change significantly with the $a$ axis size. The median axis ratio is $1:1.23:1.45$. The RR Lyrae distribution in the SMC has a very regular, ellipsoidal shape and does not show any substructures or asymmetries. All triaxial ellipsoids fitted to surfaces of a constant number density have virtually the same shape (axis ratio) and are elongated along the line of sight. The median axis ratio is $1:1.10:2.13$. The inclination angle is very small and thus the position angle is not well defined. We present the distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Magellanic Bridge area, showing that the Magellanic Clouds' halos overlap. A comparison of the distributions of RR Lyrae stars and Classical Cepheids shows that the former are significantly more spread and distributed regularly, while the latter are very clumped and form several distinct substructures.",

    "abstract": "The March 5 1979 event was the strongest gamma-ray burst ever observed. Its location in the sky is known with an accuracy of about 10 arcsec, and it coincides with the N49 supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The main burst was followed by a soft tail with the periodic 8 s modulation, and 16 soft gamma events over the following few years. If the source is a magnetic neutron star with the 8 s rotation period and the age of about 10 exp 4 years as indicated by N49 then the field strength of about 5 x 10 exp 14 gauss is implied. The corresponding critical luminosity is about 10 exp 4 L(Edd), as the electron scattering opacity is suppressed by the strong magnetic field. This luminosity is consistent with the observed peak flux of the soft tail and the soft repeaters. The soft spectrum may be approximated with the photospheric emission at kT(eff) = 17 keV. The corresponding photospheric radius is about 14 km, compatible with a neutron star hypothesis. The total magnetic energy of the star is about 4 x 10 exp 46 erg, more than enough to power the March 5 event and all its repeaters.",

The system is quite nearby for a microlensing planet, DL=0.86±0.09 kpc. Indeed, it was the large lens-source relative πrel=1.0 mas (combined with the low mass M) that gave rise to the large, and thus well-measured, microlens parallax πE∝(πrel/M)1/2 that enabled these precise measurements. OGLE-2017-BLG-1434Lb is the eighth microlensing planet with planet-host mass ratio q<1×10-4.\r\n\r\n We apply a new planet-detection sensitivity method, which is a variant of V/Vmax, to seven of these eight planets to derive the mass-ratio function in this regime. We find dN/d lnq ∝ qp, with p=1.05+0.78-0.68, which confirms the turnover in the mass function found by Suzuki et al. relative to the power law of opposite sign n=-0.93±0.13 at higher mass ratios q≳2×10-4. We combine our result with that of Suzuki et al. to obtain p=0.73+0.42-0.34.",

It was found that the normal component of the non-gravitational force exceeds the transverse one and a model of the motion including A_1, A_2, A_3 better fits the observations than model neglecting A_3. Assuming asymmetry in g(r) with respect to the perihelion the large value of displacement \\tau was derived (about 34 days), and very small negative value of transverse component A_2 was obtained. The models of rotating non-spherical nucleus also suggest the large shift of light curve with respect to perihelion (\\tau greater than 30 days). The forced precession model of 67P with \\tau = 34 days gives a prolate spheroidal shape of the rotating nucleus with axial ratio R_b/R_a = 1.16, rotational period to equatorial radius P_{rot}/R_a = 4.6\\pm 1.4 hrs/km, and torque factor f_{tor}=3\\cdot 10^5 day/AU. The much larger \\tau = 54 days gives distinctly prolate shape of nucleus with axial ratio R_b/R_a = 1.71. The orientation of spin axis of the nucleus and its evolution are presented. The past and the future dynamical evolution of comet 67P is also widely discussed.",

    "abstract": "Microlensing events can be used to directly measure the masses of single field stars to a precision of $\\sim$1-10\\%. The majority of direct mass measurements for stellar and sub-stellar objects typically only come from observations of binary systems. Hence microlensing provides an important channel for direct mass measurements of single stars. The Gaia satellite has observed $\\sim$1.7 billion objects, and analysis of the second data release has recently yielded numerous event predictions for the next few decades. However, the Gaia catalog is incomplete for nearby very-low-mass objects such as brown dwarfs for which mass measurements are most crucial. We employ a catalog of very-low-mass objects from Pan-STARRS data release 1 (PDR1) as potential lens stars, and we use the objects from Gaia data release 2 (GDR2) as potential source stars. We then search for future microlensing events up to the year 2070. The Pan-STARRS1 objects are first cross-matched with GDR2 to remove any that are present in both catalogs. This leaves a sample of 1,718 possible lenses. We fit MIST isochrones to the Pan-STARRS1, AllWISE and 2MASS photometry to estimate their masses. We then compute their paths on the sky, along with the paths of the GDR2 source objects, until the year 2070, and search for potential microlensing events. Source-lens pairs that will produce a microlensing signal with an astrometric amplitude of greater than 0.131 mas, or a photometric amplitude of greater than 0.4 mmag, are retained.",

    "abstract": "The Resonant Switch (RS) model of twin high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed in neutron star binary systems, based on switch of the twin oscillations at a resonant point, has been applied to the atoll source 4U 1636-53 under assumption that the neutron star exterior can be approximated by the Kerr geometry. Strong restrictions of the neutron star parameters M (mass) and a (spin) arise due to fitting the frequency pairs admitted by the RS model to the observed data in the regions related to the resonant points. The most precise variants of the RS model are those combining the relativistic precession frequency relations with their modifications. Here, the neutron star mass and spin estimates given by the RS model are confronted with a variety of equations of state (EoS) governing structure of neutron stars in the framework of the Hartle-Thorne theory of rotating neutron stars applied for the observationally given rotation frequency f_rot~580 Hz (or alternatively f_rot~290 Hz) of the neutron star at 4U 1636-53. It is shown that only two variants of the RS model based on the Kerr approximation are compatible with two EoS applied in the Hartle-Thorne theory for f_rot~580 Hz, while no variant of the RS model is compatible for f_rot~290 Hz. The two compatible variants of the RS model are those giving the best fits of the observational data. However, a self-consistency test by fitting the observational data to the RS model with oscillation frequencies governed by the Hartle-Thorne geometry described by three spacetime parameters M, a and (quadrupole moment) q related by the two available EoS puts strong restrictions. The test admits only one variant of the RS model of twin HF QPOs for the Hartle-Thorne theory with the Gandolfi et al. (2010) EoS predicting the parameters of the neutron star $M \\sim 2.10 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, $a \\sim 0.208$, and $q/a^2 \\sim 1.77$.",

The eastern part of the LMC is closer to us and the plane fit to the whole LMC sample yields the inclination $i=24.2\\pm0.7$ deg and position angle ${\\rm P.A.}=151.4\\pm1.7$ deg. We redefined the LMC bar by extending it in the western direction and found no offset from the plane of the LMC contrary to previous studies. On the other hand, we found that the northern arm is offset from a plane by about $-0.5$ kpc, which was not observed before. The age distribution of the LMC Cepheids shows one maximum at about 100 Myr. \r\nWe demonstrate that the SMC has a non-planar structure and can be described as an extended ellipsoid. We identified two large ellipsoidal off-axis structures in the SMC. The northern one is located closer to us and is younger, while the south-western is farther and older. The age distribution of the SMC Cepheids is bimodal with one maximum at 110 Myr, and another one at 220 Myr. Younger stars are located in the closer part of this galaxy while older ones are more distant. \r\nWe classified nine Cepheids from our sample as Magellanic Bridge objects. These Cepheids show a large spread in three-dimensions although five of them form a connection between the Clouds. The closest one is closer than any of the LMC Cepheids, while the farthest one -- farther than any SMC Cepheid. All but one Cepheids in the Magellanic Bridge are younger than 300 Myr.

I evaluate the method and software on 380 GB of OGLE-II bulge microlensing data obtained in 1997--1999 observing seasons. The error distribution is Gaussian to better than 99% with the amplitude only 17% above the photon noise limit for faint stars. Over the entire range of the observed magnitudes the resulting scatter is improved by a factor of 2--3 compared to DoPhot photometry, currently a standard tool in microlensing searches. For testing purposes the photometry of ~4600 candidate variable stars and sample difference image data are provided for BUL_SC1 field. In the candidate selection process, very few assumptions have been made about the specific types of flux variations, which makes this data set well suited for general variability studies, including the development of the classification schemes.",

Comparing pulsation properties of detected objects we find that they constitute two groups with clearly distinct features. In this paper we analyze in detail small amplitude variable red giants (about 15400 and 3000 objects in the LMC and SMC, respectively). The vast majority of these objects are multi-periodic. At least 30% of them exhibit two modes closely spaced in the power spectrum, what likely indicates non-radial oscillations. About 50% exhibit additional so called Long Secondary Period. \r\nTo distinguish between AGB and RGB red giants we compare PL diagrams of multi-periodic red giants located above and below the tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). The giants above the TRGB form four parallel ridges in the PL diagram. Among much more numerous sample of giants below the TRGB we find objects located on the low luminosity extensions of these ridges, but most of the stars are located on the ridges slightly shifted in logP. We interpret the former as the second ascent AGB red giants and the latter as the first ascent RGB objects. Thus, we empirically show that the pulsating red giants fainter than the TRGB are a mixture of RGB and AGB giants. \r\nFinally, we compare the Petersen diagrams of the LMC, SMC and Galactic bulge variable red giants and find that they are basically identical indicating that the variable red giants in all these different stellar environments share similar pulsation properties.",

A basic element is the meridional plane, used for initial scanning, which contains one of the objects and is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the other. Our method also relies on an efficient tuning technique in order to zoom in on the MOID configuration, starting from the first approximation found by scanning. We work with high accuracy and take special care to avoid the risk of missing the MOID, which is inherent to our type of approach. We demonstrate that our method is both fast, reliable and flexible.

    "abstract": "[Abridged] We test the evolutionary model of cool close binaries on the observed properties of near contact binaries (NCBs). Those with a more massive component filling the Roche lobe are SD1 binaries whereas in SD2 binaries the Roche lobe filling component is less massive. Our evolutionary model assumes that, following the Roche lobe overflow by the more massive component (donor), mass transfer occurs until mass ratio reversal. A binary in an initial phase of mass transfer, before mass equalization, is identified with SD1 binary. We show that the transferred mass forms an equatorial bulge around the less massive component (accretor). Its presence slows down the mass transfer rate to the value determined by the thermal time scale of the accretor, once the bulge sticks out above the Roche lobe. It means, that in a binary with a (typical) mass ratio of 0.5 the SD1 phase lasts at least 10 times longer than resulting from the standard evolutionary computations neglecting this effect. This is why we observe so many SD1 binaries. Our explanation is in contradiction to predictions identifying the SD1 phase with a broken contact phase of the Thermal Relaxation Oscillations model. The continued mass transfer, past mass equalization, results in mass ratio reversed. SD2 binaries are identified with this phase. Our model predicts that the time scales of SD1 and SD2 phases are comparable to one another. Analysis of the observations of 22 SD1 binaries, 27 SD2 binaries and 110 contact binaries (CBs) shows that relative number of both types of NCBs favors similar time scales of both phases of mass transfer. Total masses, orbital angular momenta and orbital periods of SD1 and SD2 binaries are indistinguishable from each other whereas they differ substantially from the corresponding parameters of CBs. We conclude that the results of the analysis fully support the model presented in this paper.",

    "abstract": "The rather wide-spread belief that cosmological expansion of a flat 3D--space (with spatial curvature k=0) cannot be observationally distinguished from a kinematics of galaxies moving in a flat and non-expanding space is erroneous. We suggest that the error may have its source in a non relativistic intuition that imagines the Universe not as a spacetime but separates space from time and pictures the cosmological expansion as space evolving in time. The physical reality, however, is fundamentally different -- the expanding Universe is necessarily a curved spacetime. We show here that the fact that the spacetime is curved implies that the interpretation of the observed cosmological redshift as being due to the expansion of the cosmological 3D--space is observationally verifiable. Thus it is impossible to mimic the true cosmological redshift by a Doppler effect caused by motion of galaxies in a non-expanding 3D-space, flat or curved. We summarize our points in simple spacetime diagrams that illustrate a gedanken experiment distinguishing between expansion of space and pure kinematics. We also provide all relevant mathematics. None of the previously published discussions of the issue, including a recent popular Scientific American article, offered a similarly clear way out of the confusion.",

    "abstract": "The distance to the Galactic center inferred from OGLE RR Lyrae variables observed in the direction of the bulge is Ro=8.1+-0.6 kpc. An accurate determination of Ro is hindered by countless effects that include an ambiguous extinction law, a bias for smaller values of Ro because of a preferential sampling of variable stars toward the near side of the bulge owing to extinction, and an uncertainty in characterizing how a mean distance to the group of variable stars relates to Ro. A VI-based period-reddening relation for RR Lyrae variables is derived to map extinction throughout the bulge. The reddening inferred from RR Lyrae variables in the Galactic bulge, LMC, SMC, and IC 1613 match that established from OGLE red clump giants and classical Cepheids. RR Lyrae variables obey a period-colour (VI) relation that is relatively insensitive to metallicity. Edge-on and face-on illustrations of the Milky Way are constructed by mapping the bulge RR Lyrae variables in tandem with cataloged red clump giants, globular clusters, planetary nebulae, classical Cepheids, young open clusters, HII regions, and molecular clouds. The sample of RR Lyrae variables do not trace a prominent Galactic bar or triaxial bulge oriented at phi~25 degrees.",

This is a collection of 38257 RR Lyr stars detected over 182 square degrees monitored photometrically by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) in the most central regions of the Galactic bulge. The sample consists of 16804 variables found and published by the OGLE collaboration in 2011 and 21453 RR Lyr stars newly detected in the photometric databases of the fourth phase of the OGLE survey (OGLE-IV). 93% of the OGLE-IV variables were previously unknown. The total sample consists of 27258 RRab, 10825 RRc, and 174 RRd stars. We provide OGLE-IV I- and V-band light curves of the variables along with their basic parameters. \r\nAbout 300 RR Lyr stars in our collection are plausible members of 15 globular clusters. Among others, we found the first pulsating variables that may belong to the globular cluster Terzan 1 and the first RRd star in the globular cluster M54. Our survey also covers the center and outskirts of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy enabling studies of the spatial distribution of the old stellar population from this galaxy. \r\nA group of double-mode RR Lyr stars with period ratios around 0.740 form a stream in the sky that may be a relic of a cluster or a dwarf galaxy tidally disrupted by the Milky Way. Three of our RR Lyr stars experienced a pulsation mode switching from double-mode to single fundamental mode or vice versa. We also present the first known RRd stars with large-amplitude Blazhko effect.",

The search for microlensing events was performed using a database of about 4*10^9 photometric measurements of about 20.5 million stars from the Galactic bulge. The Catalog comprises 214 cases of microlensing events found in the fields covering about 11 square degrees on the sky and distributed in different parts of the Galactic bulge. The sample includes 20 binary microlensing events, 14 of them are caustic crossing. In one case a double star is likely lensed. We present distribution of the basic parameters of microlensing events and show preliminary rate of microlensing in different regions of the Galactic bulge. The latter reveals clear dependence on the Galactic coordinates. The dependence on 'l' indicates that the majority of lenses toward the Galactic bulge are located in the Galactic bar. Models of the Galactic bar seem to reasonably predict the observed spatial distribution of microlensing events in the Galactic bulge. All data presented in the Catalog and photometry of all events are available from the OGLE Internet archive.",

Based on the available data it is found that the possible range of the modulation frequencies, i.e, the possible maximum value of the modulation frequency depends on the pulsation frequency. Short period variables (P 0.6 d) always exhibit modulation with P_mod > 20 d. We interpret this tendency with the equality of the modulation period with the surface rotation period, because similar distribution of the rotational periods is expected if an upper limit of the total angular momentum of stars leaving the RGB exists. The distribution of the projected rotational velocities of red and blue horizontal branch stars at different temperatures shows a similar behaviour as v_rot derived for RR Lyrae stars from their modulation periods. This common behaviour gives reason to identify the modulation period with the rotational period of the modulated RR Lyrae stars.",

    "abstract": "The microlensing surveys, such as OGLE or MACHO, have led to the discovery of thousands of RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic Bulge and in the Magellanic Clouds, allowing for detailed investigation of these stars, specially the still mysterious Blazhko phenomenon. Higher incidence rate of Blazhko (BL) variables in the more metal-rich Galactic Bulge than in the LMC, suggests that occurance of Blazhko effect correlates with metallicity (Moskalik and Poretti 2003). To investigate this problem, we calibrate the photometric method of determining the metallicity of the RRab star (Kovacs and Zsoldos 1995) to the I-band and apply it to the OGLE Galactic Bulge and LMC data. In both systems, metallicities of non Blazhko and Blazhko variables are close to each other. The LMC Blazhko pulsators prefer slightly lower metallicities. The different metallicities of the Galactic Bulge and the LMC, can't explain the observed incidence rates. \r\nAs a by-product of our metallicity estimates, we investigate the luminosity-metallicity relation, finding a steep dependence of the luminosity on [Fe/H]",

X-ray spectra were fitted to our extensive grids of model atmosphere spectra to determine the effective temperature T_eff on the neutron star surface, logarithm of surface gravity log(g), and the gravitational redshift z simultaneously. We have chosen fitting by numerical model spectra plus broad Gaussian line, modified by interstellar absorption and the absorption on dust. We arbitrarily assumed either hydrogen-helium chemical composition of a model atmosphere, or H-He-Fe mixture in solar proportion. The statistically best values of log(g), and z subsequently were used to determine mass and radius of the neutron star. We obtained the best values of the parameters for the neutron star in X-ray burst source MXB 1728-34: mass either M=0.40 or 0.63 M_sol (for H-He or H-He-Fe models, respectively), radius R=4.6 or 5.3 km, log(g)=14.6 or 14.6 and the gravitational redshift z=0.14 or 0.22. All the above parameters have very wide 1-sigma confidence limits. Their values strongly support the equation of state for strange matter in MXB 1728-34.",

    "abstract": "For many years modeling of double-mode pulsation of classical pulsators was a challenging problem. Inclusion of turbulent convection into pulsation hydrocodes finally led to stable double-mode models. However, it was never analysed, which factor of turbulent convection is crucial. We show that the double-mode behaviour displayed in the computed models results from incorrect assumptions adopted in some of the pulsation hydrocodes, namely from the neglect of buoyant forces in convectively stable layers. This leads to significant turbulent energies and consequently to strong eddy-viscous damping in deep, convectively stable layers of the model. Resulting differential reduction of fundamental and first overtone amplitudes favours the occurrence of double-mode pulsation. Once buoyant forces in convectively stable regions are taken into account (as they should), no stable double-mode behaviour is found. The problem of modeling double-mode behaviour of classical pulsators remains open.",

In this paper we present the results of a simultaneous BV RI and Hα photometric monitoring, contemporaneous to medium-resolution spectroscopy of six T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region. We have characterized the Hα photometric system using synthetic templates and the contemporaneous spectra of the targets. We show that we can achieve a precision corresponding to 2–3 A in the Hα equivalent width, in typical observing conditions. The spectral analysis has allowed us to determine the basic stellar parameters and the values of quantities related to the accretion. In particular, we have measured a significant veiling only for the three targets with the strongest Hα emission (T Tau, FM Tau, and DG Tau). The broad-band photometric variations are found to be in the range 0.05–0.70 mag and are often paired to variations in the Hα intensity, which becomes stronger when the stellar continuum is weaker. In addition, we have mostly observed a redder V − I and a bluer B −V color as the stars become fainter. For most of the targets, the timescales of these variations seem to be longer than the rotation period. One exception is T Tau, for which the broad-band photometry varies with the rotation period. The most plausible interpretation of these photometric and Hα variations is that they are due to non-stationary mass accretion onto the stars, but rotational modulation can play a major role in some cases.",

This work extends and completes a thorough search for future microlensing events initiated by Bramich (2018) and Nielsen & Bramich (2018) using GDR2. The almanac includes 161 lenses that will cause at least two microlensing events each. A few highlights are presented and discussed, including: (i) an astrometric microlensing event with a peak amplitude of ~9.7 mas, (ii) an event that will probe the planetary system of a lens with three known planets, and (iii) an event (resolvable from space) where the blend of the lens and the minor source image will brighten by a detectable amount (~2 mmag) due to the appearance of the minor source image. All of the predicted microlensing events in the almanac will exhibit astrometric signals that are detectable by observing facilities with an angular resolution and astrometric precision similar to, or better than, that of the Hubble Space Telescope (e.g. NIRCam on the James Webb Space Telescope), although the events with the most extreme source-to-lens contrast ratios may be challenging. Ground-based telescopes of at least 1 m in diameter can be used to observe many of the events that are also expected to exhibit a photometric signal.",

The age and apparent distance modulus of V54 are estimated at 13.3 - 14.7 Gyr and $13.94\\pm0.05$ mag, respectively. This age is substantially larger than ages we have derived from the analysis of binary systems in 47 Tuc and M4. The secondary of V44 is so weak in the optical domain that only mass function and relative parameters are obtained for the components of this system. However, there is a good chance that the velocity curve of the secondary could be derived from near-IR spectra. As the primary of V44 is more evolved than that of V54, such data would impose much tighter limits on the age and distance of M55.",

It contains 138 such pairs (111 flare stars) of which 31 pairs have known orbital parameters. Along with parallax mainly (but not only) taken from SIMBAD, apparent and absolute magnitudes of each component, spectral types for all primaries and the vast majority of secondaries are given. On the basis of cataloged data, absolute brightness vs. spectral type and mass vs. spectral type relations for flare and non-flare stars are constructed. It is shown that flare and non-flare stars cannot be distinguished on the absolute brightness vs. spectral type plane. Comparison between photometric and dynamical masses suggests that photometric mass of flare stars can be estimated using the mass vs. absolute brightness relation of non-flare stars.",

Carbon depletion was unimportant in the 0.8 and 1.5 solar mass models. ln the 3 solar mass model the carbon to nitrogen ratio decreased to 1:200 within the main- sequence lifetime of that model. A large carbon depletion was also obtained in the models of 5, 7, and 10 solar masses. In the models of 15, 30, and 60 solar masses carbon depletion was unimportant. (IAA)",

The combination results in 836 eclipsing binaries that display coronal activity and is the largest sample of active binary stars assembled to date. By using the (V-I) colors of the ASAS eclipsing binary catalogue, we are able to determine the distances and thus bolometric luminosities for the majority of eclipsing binaries that display significant stellar activity. A typical value for the ratio of soft X-ray to bolometric luminosity is L_X/L_bol ~ a few x 10^-4, similar to the ratio of soft X-ray to bolometric flux F_X/F_bol in the most active regions of the Sun. Unlike rapidly rotating isolated late-type dwarfs -- stars with significant outer convection zones -- a tight correlation between Rossby number and activity of eclipsing binaries is absent. We find evidence for the saturation effect and marginal evidence for the so-called super-saturation phenomena. Our work shows that wide-field stellar variability searches can produce a high yield of binary stars with strong coronal activity. \r\nThe combined ASAS and RASS catalogue, as well as the results of this work are available for download in a form of a file.",

The distances to these objects are derived from the period-luminosity relation and estimates of the mass-loss rates made from the Ko-[12] colour. \r\nWe reclassify AS 245 as an S-type symbiotic, with a semi-regular cool component with a pulsation period of about one year. The periods of the large amplitude pulsations of SS73 38 (463 days), AS 210 (423 days) and H2-38 (395 days) are estimated for the first time, confirming that they are symbiotic Miras. \r\nA comparison of the symbiotic Miras with normal Miras of similar pulsation period shows that the symbiotic stars have on average higher values of Ko-[12].

While the distribution of ratios inferred from an occurrence of a single QPO seems to be consistent with a random walk, the distribution based on simultaneous detections of both peaks indicates a preference of ratios of small integers. Based on the public RXTE data we further investigate this issue for the source 4U 1636−53. Quality factors and rms amplitudes of both the QPOs nearly equal to the points where the frequencies are commensurable, and where the twin QPO detections cluster. We discuss a connection of the clustering with the varying properties of the two QPO modes. Assuming approximative relations for the observed correlations of the QPO properties, we attempt to reproduce the frequency and ratio distributions using a simple model of a random-walk evolution along the observed frequency-frequency correlation. We obtain results which are in qualitative agreement with the observed distributions.",

High quality BVI observations (120-360 epochs in the I-band and 15-40 in the BV-bands) were collected during the OGLE-II microlensing experiment. The I-band diagrams of the LMC show very small scatter, \\sigma=0.074 mag, indicating that Cepheid variables can potentially be a very good standard candle. We compare relations of fundamental mode Cepheids from the LMC and SMC and we do not find significant differences of slopes of the Period-Luminosity- Color and Period-Luminosity relations in these galaxies. For the first overtone Cepheids a small change of the slope of Period-Luminosity relation is possible. We determine the difference of distance moduli between the SMC and LMC with Cepheid relations and compare the result with difference obtained with other standard candles: RR Lyr and red clump stars. Results are very consistent and indicate that the values of zero points of the fundamental mode Cepheid relations are similar in these galaxies. The mean difference of distance moduli between the SMC and LMC is equal to \\mu_SMC-\\mu_LMC=0.51\\pm0.03 mag. We calibrate the Period-Luminosity-Color and Period-Luminosity relations for classical, fundamental mode Cepheids using the observed LMC relations and adopting the short LMC distance modulus, \\mu_LMC=18.22\\pm0.05 mag, resulting from the recent determination with eclipsing system HV2274, RR Lyr and red clump stars and consistent with observations of Cepheids in NGC4258 galaxy, to which precise geometric distance is known. Finally, we determine a constraint on the absolute magnitude of Cepheids by comparison of their mean V-band magnitude with that of RR Lyr stars in both Magellanic Clouds.",

    "abstract": "We have used photometric data on almost 91 000 fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars (type RRab) detected by the OGLE survey to investigate properties of old populations in the Milky Way. Based on their metallicity distributions, we demonstrate that the Galaxy is built from three distinct old components: halo, bulge, and disk. The distributions reach their maxima at approximately [Fe/H]_J95 = -1.2, -1.0, and -0.6 dex on the Jurcsik's metallicity scale, respectively. We find that, very likely, the entire halo is formed from infalling dwarf galaxies. It is evident that halo stars penetrate the inner regions of the Galactic bulge. We estimate that about one-third of all RR Lyr stars within the bulge area belong in fact to the halo population. The whole old bulge is dominated by two populations, A and B, represented by a double sequence in the period-amplitude (Bailey) diagram. The boundary in iron abundance between the halo and the disk population is at about [Fe/H]_J95 = -0.8 dex. Using Gaia DR2 for RRab stars in the disk area, we show that the observed dispersion of proper motions along the Galactic latitude decreases smoothly with the increasing metal content excluding a bump around [Fe/H]_J95 = -1.0 dex.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents 1.4-GHz radio continuum observations of 15 very extended radio galaxies. These sources are so large that most interferometers lose partly their structure and total flux density. Therefore, single-dish detections are required to fill in the central (u,v) gap of interferometric data and obtain reliable spectral index patterns across the structures, and thus also an integrated radio continuum spectrum. We have obtained such 1.4-GHz maps with the 100-m Effelsberg telescope and combined them with the corresponding maps available from the NVSS. The aggregated data allow us to produce high-quality images, which can be used to obtain physical parameters of the mapped sources. The combined images reveal in many cases extended low surface-brightness cocoons.",

Recently, two additional transiting sub-Earth planets have been postulated in the literature. We observed three transits of GJ 436 b over the course of 3 years using two-meter class telescopes, each with a photometric precision better than one millimagnitude. We studied system dynamics based on the existence of the additional planets. We redetermined system parameters, which were in agreement with those found in the literature. We refined the orbital period of GJ 436 b and found no evidence of transit timing variations. The orbital motion of the GJ 436 c planet candidate was found to be significantly affected by the planet b with variations in transit times at a level of 20 minutes. As the orbital period of the GJ 436 d planet candidate remains unknown, our numerical experiments rule out orbits in low-order resonances with GJ 436 b. The GJ 436 system with the hot Neptune and additional two Earth-like planets, if confirmed, would be an important laboratory for studies of formation and evolution of planetary systems.",

Among those, 512 candidate microlensing events were selected visually. We designed an automated procedure, which unambiguously selects up to 237 best events. Including 8 candidate events recovered by other means, a total of 520 light curves are presented in this work. \r\nIn addition to microlensing events, the larger sample contains certain types of transients, but is also strongly contaminated by artifacts. All 4424 light curves in the weakly filtered group are available electronically, with the intent of showing the gray zone between microlensing events and variable stars, as well as artifacts, to some extent inevitable in massive data reductions. We welcome suggestions for improving the selection process before the full analysis of complete 4 seasons of the OGLE-II bulge data. Selection criteria for binary events can also be investigated with our extended sample.",

    "abstract": "Main aim of this paper is the first light curve and apsidal motion analysis of thirteen eccentric eclipsing binaries and to reveal their basic physical properties. All of the systems were studied by method of period analysis of times of minima and the light curve analysis. Many new times of minima for all of the systems were derived and collected from the data obtained by the automatic, robotic or satellite telescopes. This allow us to study the apsidal motion in these systems in detail for the first time. From the light curve analysis the first rough estimations of the physical properties of these systems were done. The analyzed systems undergo an apsidal motion with the following periods in years: AR CMa (44 +/- 10), OZ Hya (117 +/- 53), V498 Mon (62 +/- 4), V521 Mon (217 +/- 37), V684 Mon (74.5 +/- 20), V730 Mon (39 +/- 12), GV Nor (197 +/- 67), NS Nor (516 +/- 230), TZ Pyx (157 +/- 37), V385 Sco (1926 +/- 980), V629 Sco (56 +/- 17), V881 Sco (131 +/- 48), V1082 Sco (186 +/- 280). Also 190 new minima times were derived and included. The period and light curve analyses were done, however a more detailed spectroscopic analysis is needed to confirm the physical parameters of the components with higher conclusiveness.",

Numerical examples show that for initial libration widths larger than about 60 arcd, the Trojan is ultimately driven out of the libration domain, becoming an ordinary asteroid, if Jupiter's transferred mass increases by a factor less than about two. Certain processes occurring in our solar system and in extrasolar planetary systems lead to a decrease of the Trojan's libration amplitude, while other processes lead to an increase, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Following the suggestion of Gould and Depoy (1998) we investigate the feasibility of studying the brightest microlensing events towards the Galactic bulge using a small aperture (~10 cm) telescope. We used one of the HAT telescopes to obtain 151 exposures spanning 88 nights in 2005 of an 8.4x8.4 square degree FOV centered on (l,b) = (2.85, -5.00). We reduced the data using image subtraction software. We find that such a search method can effectively contribute to monitoring bright microlensing events, as was advocated. Comparing this search method to the existing ones we find a dedicated bulge photometric survey of this nature would fulfill a significant niche at excellent performance and rather low cost. We obtain matches to 7 microlensing events listed in the 2005 OGLE archives. We find several other light curves whose fits closely resemble microlensing events. Unsurprisingly, many periodic variables and miscellaneous variables are also detected in our data, and we estimate approximately 50% of these are new discoveries. We conclude by briefly proposing Small Aperture Microlensing Survey, which would monitor the Galactic bulge around the clock to provide dense coverage of the highest magnification microlensing events.",

Based on three photometric campaigns launched in 2008 we obtained 5 light curves (3 in V, 1 in B and 1 in I), and derived an orbital period of 0.451780+-0.000001 d. We also obtained 20 VLT/UVES spectra, enabling accurate radial velocity measurements. The derived masses and radii of the components (m1 = 0.733 +-0.005 Msun and R1 = 0.72 +-0.01 Rsun; m2 = 0.662 +-0.005 Msun and R2 = 0.68 \\+-0.02 Rsun) are consistent with the empirical mass-radius relationship established recently for lower main sequence stars in binary systems; in particular we find that both stars are oversized compared to theoretical models. NGC2204-S892 is very active: both components show variable emission in Halpha and Hbeta and are heavily spotted, causing the light curve to show appreciable changes on a timescale of weeks. Our results add to the increasing evidence that the observed inflation of the radii of K and M stars is related to high levels of magnetic activity.",

The sample covers 75% of the sky and contains objects in the close neighbourhood of the Sun, within 4 kpc distance. Unlike in the previous analysis of the close field RRab, we see a clear manifestation of the Oosterhoff groups on the period - amplitude diagram. The relation for Oosterhoff I type variables becomes strongly flattened at large V amplitudes, which was not observed for globular cluster RR Lyrae. We calculate photometric metallicities using two available methods: one of Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996) and the other of Sandage (2004). We find significant discrepancies between results from both methods. Comparison with spectroscopic metallicities undoubtedly favors the method of Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996). In addition, we notice that RRab of Oosterhoff II type might follow a different metallicity-period-phase relation than Oosterhoff I type variables. The spatial distribution of Galactic field RRab does not show any metallicity gradients with distance from the Galactic Center in either of the Oosterhoff groups. However, both the older, metal poor Oosterhoff II variables and the metal rich Oosterhoff I RRab become more concentrated to the Galactic plane with increasing metal content.",

    "abstract": "A toy model of a disk undergoing steady state accretion onto a black hole is presented. The disk is in a hydrostatic equilibrium for all radii r > r_{in}, with the inner disk radius located between the marginally stable and marginally bound orbits: r_{ms} > r_{in} > r_{mb}. Matter flows from the disk through a narrow cusp at r_{ms} and falls freely into the black hole, carrying with it no thermal energy. At radii larger than r_{out} the disk is assumed to radiate away all locally generated heat, and therefore the disk is geometrically thin for r > r_{out}. We assume that no heat generated in the inner disk, with r_{out} > r > r_{in} can be radiated away, i.e. the disk is 100% advective, and it becomes geometrically thick in this range of radii. All enthalpy of the thick disk is used up to press the inner disk radius towards the marginally bound orbit, and to lower the efficiency of conversion of accreted mass into radiation generated only for r > r_{out}, by assumption. \r\nConservation laws of mass, angular momentum and energy make it possible to calculate the inner thick disk radius r_{in} for any specified value of its outer radius r_{out}. As the nature of disk viscosity is not known there is some freedom in choosing the shape of the thick disk, subject to several general conditions, which include the hydrostatic equilibrium everywhere for r > r_{in}. The main purpose of this toy model is to emphasize the effect the disk thickness has on lowering the energetic efficiency of a black hole accretion.",

The survey is based on deep ground-based images obtained with the MegaCam instrument on the CFHT telescope. We provide g'r'i' photometry for detected objects as well as estimates of the FWHM and ellipticity of their profiles. The sample includes 122 new, relatively bright, likely globular clusters. Follow-up observations of fainter candidates from our list may extend the faint-end of the observed luminosity function of globular clusters in M33 by up to 3 magnitudes. The catalog includes several cluster candidates located in the outskirts of the galaxy. These objects are promising targets for deep photometry with the HST. We present a color-magnitude diagram for one detected object, showing that it is an extended and low-surface-brightness old cluster located at an angular distance of 27' from the center of M33.",

Previous study revealed 19 such repeating event candidates among 4120 investigated microlensing light curves of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). The same study gave the probability ~ 0.0027 for a repeating event caused by a binary lens. We present the simulations of binary source lensing events and calculate the probability of observing a second brightening in the light curve. Applying to simulated light curves the same algorithm as was used in the analysis of real OGLE data, we find the probability ~ 0.0018 of observing a second brightening in a binary source lensing curve. The expected and measured numbers of repeating events are in agreement only if one postulates that all lenses and all sources are binary. Since the fraction of binaries is believed to be <= 50%, there seems to be a discrepancy.",

Light curve in this interval is dominated by a large amplitude around 0.8 mag modulation consisting two periods. Higher amplitude signal is characterized by period of 0.082159(4) days, which was increasing at the rate of dotP/Psh = 3.8(3)* 10^{-5}. Weaker and stable signal has period of 0.084176(21) days. Knowing the superhump period of BF Ara determined by Kato et al. (2003) and equal to 0.08797(1) days, the first modulation is interpreted as quiescent negative superhump arising from retrograde precesion of titled accretion disk and the latter one as an orbital period of the binary. The respective period excess and defect are epsilon_+ = 4.51% +/- 0.03% and epsilon_- = -2.44% +/- 0.02%. Thus BF Ara is yet another in-the-gap nova with mass ratio q of around 0.21.",

Robust variograms/structure functions have been computed for each time-series and only candidates showing a significant increasing variability over longer time scales were selected. \r\nSeveral light curves were identified as having probable artifacts and were therefore removed. Stars showing signs of periodicity or small trends in their light curves were also removed and we are left with mostly either Be stars (gamma Cas stars) or QSO candidates. \r\nWe present a list of 25 slowly varying objects for SMC and 155 for LMC, out of 15'000 and 53'000 variable objects respectively. Of these, about 15 objects for the SMC and 118 objects for the LMC are QSO candidates.",

The candidates have been selected by visual light curves inspection from the subsample of strong transient events; the same procedure gives 215 single lens candidates. Among the double lenses there are 12 cases interpreted as caustic crossing events. We compare the mass ratio and separation distributions obtained for binary lenses with the predictions based on stellar double systems observations. We take into account the selection bias, which causes over-representation of binary lenses of similar mass and separation close to the Einstein radius. There is no strong discrepancy between the expected and observed distributions of the mass ratio or the binary separations. We find two cases of binary lens candidates, SC20_1793 and SC20_3525, with extreme mass ratios, which may suggest presence of planets or brown dwarf companions. Unfortunately, neither case is very strong, as alternative solutions give fits to the data which are only unsubstantially worse. Binary lenses provide a modest contribution to overall optical depth to microlensing.",

The column density of Mg II, S II, Si II and Zn II is well correlated with the distance. However, the column density -- distance relation should be used with care for the estimation of the distance to OB stars. For stars with large $f(H_2)$ this relation can lead to a large overestimation of the distance. Hydrogen -- normalised column densities of Mg II, Si II and Ge II (our largest samples of data) drop with the interstellar reddening E(B-V) as expected for elements that are incorporated into dust grains. The Ge II abundance (GeII/H) is lower in dense molecular clouds. The abundances of all analysed elements are generally lower than their Solar System values.",

The 2D wavelet transforms for three bivariate distributions $(U,V)$, $(U,W)$, and $(V,W)$ were investigated. Though most of currently known (low-velocity) stellar moving groups are densely overlapped in these diagrams, our analysis allowed to detect and disentangle about twenty statistically significant 3D groups of stars with high velocities. Most of them appear new. We also discuss the issue of correct noise thresholding in the wavelet transform and highlight the importance of using a global rather than local statistic for that. Using of a local significance measure may lead to an overstated statistical confidence for individual patterns due to the effect of multiple testing.",

    "abstract": "Origins of giant planets on tight orbits, so called hot Jupiters, are a long-lasting question in the planetary formation and evolution theory. The answer seems to be hidden in architectures of those systems that remain only partially understood. Using multi-sector time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we searched for additional planets in the KELT-18, KELT-23, KELT-24, Qatar-8, WASP-62, WASP-100, WASP-119, and WASP-126 planetary systems using both the transit technique and transit timing method. Our homogenous analysis has eliminated the presence of transiting companions down to the terrestrial-size regime in the KELT-23 and WASP-62 systems, and down to mini-Neptunes or Neptunes in the remaining ones. Transit timing analysis has revealed no sign of either long-term trends or periodic perturbations for all the studied hot Jupiters, including the WASP-126 b for which deviations from a Keplerian model were claimed in the literature. The loneliness of the planets of the sample speaks in favour of the high-eccentricity migration mechanism that probably brought them to their tight orbits observed nowadays. As a byproduct of our study, the transit light curve parameters were redetermined with a substantial improvement of the precision for 6 systems. For KELT-24 b, a joint analysis allowed us to place a tighter constraint on its orbital eccentricity.",

We consider the effects of such accretion flow eclipses on the X-ray light curves of accretion powered pulsars, and present a set of X-ray light-curves measured by BATSE for A0535+262 for which this phenomenon is very likely to take place.",

An eclipsing binary with known distance and with photometric and double-line spectroscopic orbits determined can be used in the process of calibrating the relation between the stellar surface brightness and the color that is crucial for the method of the distance determination by means of eclipsing binaries. This list is being published in order to draw attention of observers using small telescopes to these bright, potentially useful and in the most cases poorly observed objects. The advantages of the eclipsing binary method of the distance determination are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We present the results of our search for variable stars in the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 7789. We have found 45 variable stars: 35 eclipsing binaries, five pulsating variables and five miscellaneous variables. Most of the eclipsing binaries show W UMa type of variability, with periods shorter than one day. Four systems exhibit unusual behavior: two, V4276 and V6698, are probably RS CVn stars, another, V3283, is a possible cataclysmic binary. The nature of the fourth binary, V2130, is unclear: the system exhibits assymetric maxima. Among the pulsating variables two, V3407C and V4805 are background RR Lyrae stars and one, V6736, is a delta Scuti variable which is a blue straggler belonging to the cluster. Some of the miscellaneous variables may have periods longer than the five day timespan of our observations. We also present a color-magnitude diagram for the NGC 7789 open cluster, fairly complete down to V ~ 20. The relatively large number of variables found in the comparison field (14 compared to 31 in the cluster field) implies that objects not associated physically with the cluster can account for a significant number of variables identified in the cluster field, as well as in other globular and open clusters observed on a dense background/foreground of disk stars.",

This relation serves as a test for the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole and as a method for estimating beta. We calculate the misalignment angle between the two vectors and compare it to the observed value for the PSCz survey. The latter value is near the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the angle; therefore, the nonlinear effects are unlikely to be responsible for the whole observed misalignment. We also study the relation between the amplitudes of the LG velocity and gravity vectors. In an Omega=1 Universe, the smoothed gravity of the LG turns out to be a biased low estimator of the LG (unsmoothed) velocity. In an Omega=0.3 Universe, the estimator is biased high. The discussed biases are, however, only a few per cent, thus the linear theory works to good accuracy. The gravity-based estimator of the LG velocity has also a scatter that limits the precision of the estimate of beta in the LG velocity-gravity comparisons. The random error of beta due to nonlinear effects amounts to several per cent.",

The slope of the reddening line obtained from our sample is in very good agreement with the earlier one derived with red clump stars and the one derived with RR~Lyr stars in the Galactic bulge. \r\nOur Population II Cepheids follow the same period--luminosity (P--L) relation indicating similar status of these objects. We compare the P--L relation of these stars with the relation of Population II Cepheid detected by the OGLE-II survey in the LMC.

The amplitudes of the fundamental mode are found to decrease significantly during superoutburst while those of the overtones remain practically constant. The phases of maxima of the fundamental mode {\\it increase} systematically during superoutburst while those of the overtones -- systematically {\\it decrease}. The combination of the two effects is responsible for the characteristic evolution of superhump light curves: the appearance and growth of the secondary humps and the spurious phase jumps in the (O-C) diagrams. Two intrepretations are possible. Either that instead of just one superhump period $P_{sh}$ there are four periods $P_k$ which resemble -- but are significantly different from -- the fundamental mode and the first three overtones of $P_{sh}$. Or -- more likely -- that those time-dependent phase shifts are genuine.",

By observing characteristic, rare deviations in the gravitational microlensing light curve one can discover that a lens is a star--planet system. In this paper we consider an opposite case where the lens is a single star and the source has a transiting planetary companion. We have studied the light curve of a source star with transiting companion magnified during microlensing event. Our model shows that in dense stellar fields, in which blending is significant, the light drop generated by transits is greater near the maximum of microlensing, which makes it easier to detect. We derive the probability for the detection of a planetary transit in a microlensed source to be of 2*10^(-6) for an individual microlensing event.",

Machine learning techniques are often applied in order to perform this task automatically.

We present a new method for automated artifact filtering based on hierarchical unsupervised classifier employing Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). The system accepts 97 % of real transients and removes 97.5 % of artifacts when tested on the OGLE-IV Transient Detection System. The improvement of the artifacts filtering allowed for single-frame based rapid detections of transients within OGLE-IV, which now alerts on transient discoveries in less than 15 minutes from the image acquisition.",

It is shown that, in almost all models, angular anisotropy as measured with either dipole or quadrupole moments is much stronger and should be much easier to detect than the radial nonuniformity of the source distribution as measured with V/V sub max test. Recent reports that V/V sub max is about 0.4 demonstrate that the 'edge' of GRBs distribution has been reached. Therefore, if the bursters are in the Galaxy, then their distribution in the sky should be very anisotropic, with a large dipole or quadrupole moment for halo or disk origin, respectively. Absence of strong anisotropy would indicate cosmological origin. Another possibility could be a very extended halo origin, with the core radius Rc greater than 17 kpc, the range of observations Dmax greater than 50 kpc, and a spherical density distribution, the set of conditions that would be very difficult to understand.",

    "abstract": "We present the results of a photometric variability survey in the young open cluster Stock 14 and the surrounding fields. In total, we detected 103 variable stars of which 88 are new discoveries. We confirm short-period, low-amplitude light variations in two eclipsing members of the cluster, HD 101838 and HD 101794. In addition, we find two new beta Cephei stars of which one, HD 101993, is also a member. The sample of pulsating cluster members is supplemented by one multimode slowly pulsating B-type star and several single-mode candidates of this type. The other pulsating stars in our sample are mostly field stars. In particular, we found fourteen delta Scuti stars including one gamma Dor/delta Sct hybrid pulsator. From our UBV photometry we derived new parameters of Stock 14: the mean reddening E(B-V) = 0.21 +/- 0.02 mag, the true distance modulus, 11.90 +/- 0.05 mag, and the age, 20 +/- 10 Myr. Finally, we use the new photometry to analyze changes of the 6.322-d orbital period of the bright eclipsing binary and the member of the cluster, V346 Cen. In addition to the known apsidal motion, we find that another effect, possibly light-time effect in a hierarchical system of a very long orbital period, affects these changes. The updated value of the period of apsidal motion for this system amounts to 306 +/- 4 yr. The open cluster Stock 14 was found to be a fairly good candidate for successful ensemble asteroseismology.",

Some physical characteristics (e.g. black hole mass, accretion rate, equipartition magnetic field, energy density and particle density of ambient medium) based on the optical and radio data are provided. We have also found that the quasar has a relatively large central black hole mass and a very small accretion rate in comparison with similar objects.",

Based on the systemic velocity, distance, and proper motion of V60 we conclude that the system is a member of the cluster and argue that its present state is a result of rapid but conservative mass exchange which the binary is still undergoing.

NZ Boo, HT Cas and PU UMa are added to the sample of high inclination dwarf novae showing -- during their superoutbursts -- modulation of the observed brightness of the disk with beat period. Simple model calculations confirm earlier hypothesis that this modulation is due to a non-axisymmetric structure of the outer parts of the disk, involving the azimuthal dependence of their geometrical thickness, rotating with the beat period. \r\nThe modulation amplitude $A_{mod}$ is found to decrease during superoutbursts. In particular, it is found that during two superoutbursts of OY Car the rate of decline of the superhump amplitude $dA_{SH}/dt$ was correlated with the rate of decline $dA_{mod}/dt$. This leads to a simple explanation for the decreasing amplitudes of superhumps: it is a consequence of the decreasing modulation amplitude.",

Here we present an investigation of the Galactic bulge, where we apply principal component abundance analysis (PCAA) - a principal component decomposition of relative abundances [X/Fe] to a sample of 35 microlensed bulge dwarf and subgiant stars, characterizing their distribution in the 12-dimensional space defined by their measured elemental abundances. The first principal component PC I, which suffices to describe the abundance patterns of most stars in the sample, shows a strong contribution from alpha-elements, reflecting the relative contributions of Type II and Type 1a supernovae. The second principal component PC2 is characterized by a Na-Ni correlation, the likely product of metallicity-dependent Type II supernova yields. The distribution in PC I is bimodal, showing that the bimodality previously found in the [Fe/H] values of these stars is robustly and independently recovered by looking at only their relative abundance patterns. The two metal-rich stars that are alpha-enhanced have outlier values of PC2 and PC3, respectively, further evidence that they have distinctive enrichment histories. Applying PCAA to a sample of local thin and thick disk dwarfs yields a nearly identical PC I. In PC I, the metal-rich and metal-poor bulge dwarfs track kinematically selected thin and thick disk dwarfs, respectively, suggesting broadly similar alpha-enrichment histories. However, the disk PC2 is dominated by a Y-Ba correlation, likely indicating a contribution of s-process enrichment from long-lived asymptotic giant branch stars that is absent from the bulge PC2 because of its rapid formation.

This shows that at high inclinations the superhump lIght source is {\\it partly} obscured by the disk edge and implies that it is located close to the disk surface but extends sufficiently high above that surface to avoid full obscuration. Superhump amplitudes in high inclination systems show modulation with beat phase ($\\phi_b$), interpreted as being due to azimuth-dependent obscuration effects in a non-axisymmetric disk. In addition they show modulation with $2\\phi_b$ which implies that the orientation of the superhump light source is correlated with the direction of the stream. \r\nThe dependence of superhump amplitudes on orbital inclination and their modulation with beat phase eliminate the tidal-resonance model for superhumps. Instead they support an alternative interpretation of superhumps as being due to periodically modulated dissipation of the kinetic energy of the stream. \r\nSuperhump amplitudes in permanent superhumpers are $ =0.12$, i.e. much smaller than the maximum amplitudes observed during superoutbursts.",

    "abstract": "We present photometric observations of the dwarf nova 1RXS J053234.9+624755. We performed a detailed analysis of the superoutburst that occurred in August 2009. We found the superhump period to be P_sh=0.057122(14)days. Based on the O-C diagram we conclude that P_sh increased during the plateau at the rate of dP_sh/dt=(9.24 +- 1.4) * 10^-5. Both the O-C analysis and evolution of the superhumps light curve favour the model in which superhumps originate in a variable source located in the vicinity of the hot spot. In addition, the evolution of the light curve suggests that the superhump light source approaches the disc plane as the superoutburst declines. Detailed analysis of the superoutburst plateau phase enabled us to detect a signal which we interpret as apsidal motion of the accretion disc. We detected additional modulations during the final stage of the superoutburst characterized by periods of 104s and 188s which we tentatively interpret as quasi periodic oscillations. Estimations of A_0 and A_n are in agreement with the dependence discovered by Smak (2010) between the amplitude of superhumps and the orbital inclination.",

Often, the observed periods may be explained in terms of simultaneous excitation of two or rarely three radial modes. However, a secondary variability at about 0.6 of the dominant period, detected in a number of the first overtone (1O) pulsators inhabiting the Magellanic Clouds, seems to require a different explanation. After reviewing a possibility of explaining this signal in terms of radial and nonradial modes, I find that only unstable modes that may reproduce the observed period ratio are f-modes of high angular degrees (l=42-50). I discuss in detail the driving effect behind the instability and show that it is not the familiar opacity mechanism. Finally, I emphasize the main difficulty of this explanation, which requires high intrinsic amplitudes implying large broadening of spectral line.",

We identify four detached eclipsing binaries and eight contact binaries. Accurate periods are found for all but two variables. Nineteen variables are proper-motion members of the cluster, and the remaining three are field stars. Five variables are optical counterparts of X-ray sources. For one of the variables unassociated with X-ray sources we report a flare lasting for about 90 min and reaching an amplitude of 0.11 mag in V. One of the new contact binaries has a record-low mass ratio q=0.06. Another four such systems show season-to season luminosity variations probably related to magnetic activity cycles, whose lengths are surprisingly similar to that of the solar cycle despite a huge difference in rotational periods. The location of contact binaries on the color-magnitude diagram of M4 strongly suggests that at least in globular clusters the principal factor enabling EW systems to form from close but detached binaries is stellar evolution. We identify 46 blue and yellow stragglers in M4 and discuss their properties. We also derive a map of the differential extinction in the central part of M4, and determine the reddening of a selected reference region, E(B-V)= 0.392 mag.",

    "abstract": "We present results of a search for objects with H-alpha excess, such as cataclysmic variables (CVs) and chromospherically active binaries (ABs), as counterparts to X-ray sources detected with Chandra satellite observatory in six Galactic globular clusters (GCs): M4, M28, M30, M71, M80, NGC 6752. Binary systems play a critical role in the evolution of GCs, serving as an internal energy source countering the tendency of GC cores to collapse. Theoretical studies predict dozens of CVs in the cores of some GCs (e.g., 130 for M28, 40 for M30). A number of such binaries is also expected outside the core radius. However, few CVs are known so far in GCs. Using subtraction technique applied to images taken with the 4.1-m SOAR telescope we have found 27 objects with H-alpha excess in the field of the observed clusters, of which nine are likely associated with the clusters. Four are candidate CVs, four candidate ABs, one could be either a CV or an AB. One H-alpha object seems to be a background galaxy, while other 17 detected objects are probably foreground or background stars.",

More than 45 000 stars in 24 Selected Fields covering 140 sq. degrees were monitored a few times a night resulting in the I-band catalog containing 10^7 individual measurements. Period search revealed 126 periodic variables brighter than 13 mag. Only 30 of them are known variables included in GCVS. The other 90 objects are newly detected variables - mainly eclipsing binaries (75%) and pulsating stars (17%). We estimate that completeness of the current catalogs of variable stars is smaller than 50% already for the stars brighter than 9 mag. The Catalog is accessible over the WWW: this http URL",

The light curve of u Her is found to be intrinsically variable, the variable light curve is rectified, and the adjusted light and color curves are plotted. A simultaneous solution to three adjusted OAO 2 light curves (at respective wavelengths of 3320, 1910, and 1550 A) is obtained by using the Roche model. The results indicate that the system is semidetached if the gravity darkening of the secondary is not significantly larger than expected. It is suggested that the primary is responsible for the variable light curve, that the monochromatic albedo of the secondary is very low at short wavelengths, and that the depth of primary eclipse is strongly dependent on the primary's limb darkening.",

    "abstract": "We present UBVI photometry for 8530 stars in Baade's Window obtained during the OGLE-II microlensing survey. Among these are over one thousand red clump giants. 1391 of them have photometry with errors smaller than 0.04, 0.06, 0.12, and 0.20 mag in the I, V, B and U-band, respectively. We constructed a map of interstellar reddening. The corrected colors of the red clump giants: (U-B)_0, (B-V)_0, and (V-I)_0 are very well correlated, indicating that a single parameter determines the observed spread of their values, reaching almost 2 mag in the (U-B)_0. It seems most likely that heavy element content is the dominant parameter, but it is possible that another parameter: the age (or mass) of a star moves it along the same trajectory in the color--color diagram as the metallicity. The current ambiguity can be resolved with spectral analysis, and our catalog may be useful as a finding list of red clump giants. We point out that these K giants are more suitable for a fair determination of the distribution of metallicity than brighter M giants. \r\nWe also present a compilation of UBVI data for 308 red clump giants near the Sun, for which Hipparcos parallaxes are more accurate than 10%. Spectral analysis of their metallicity may provide information about the local metallicity distribution as well as the extent to which mass (age) of these stars affects their colors. \r\nIt is remarkable that in spite of a number of problems, stellar models agree with observations at the 0.1-0.2 mag level, making red clump giants not only the best calibrated but also the best understood standard candle.",

    "abstract": "The eclipsing system OGLE-SMC-ECL-0277 was found to exhibit unusual photometric variability. Beside its eclipsing nature additional variations with the periodicity of about 1500 d are also seen. Variations of the eclipse depth during the time span of the observational data (mainly taken from the OGLE survey, partly our new ones) are the most pronounced. The complex behavior of all these changes makes this system absolutely unique, no such variability was ever detected and studied in other systems before. Hence, are there some new phenomena, new physics or an unknown effects playing a role? We tried to understand these variations using four different hypotheses (i.e. inclination change, spot evolution, and/or pulsation of one or both components) and comparing their results we discussed which of them is the most likely. Neither of the presented hypotheses is able to describe in detail the behavior of OGLE-SMC-ECL-0277. We also discuss a possibility that the variable can be a member of the so-called double periodic variables group.",

    "abstract": "We present results of a search for variable stars in the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 7044. We found 23 variable stars in the observed field. One star turned out to be of the delta Sct type with two pulsational modes excited. From the position in the color-magnitude diagram we conclude that this star is a member of the cluster. Moreover, we found 13 eclipsing systems, of which five are W UMa stars, one is a beta Lyr variable, six are beta Per binaries showing detached configuration, and the last one is another probable beta Per system. Using the period-luminosity-color relation for W UMa stars we established the membership of the contact binaries, finding four of them to be very probable cluster members. We estimated from these four stars an apparent distance modulus (m-M)_V of NGC 7044 to be 14.2 +/- 0.4 mag, which is smaller than previous determinations of this parameter. We were able to derive orbital period for only four beta Per systems. For the remaining ones we observed only two or three eclipses. Finally, nine stars we found to show irregular light changes. Most of them are red stars not belonging to the cluster. For the cluster core we determined a reddening map, which allowed us to construct a dereddened color-magnitude diagram of NGC 7044 with a narrow main-sequence. By fitting a theoretical isochrone to this diagram we derived E(V-I_C) = 0.92 mag, (m-M)_V = 14.45 mag and log(age/yr) = 9.2.",

Le rapport du flux au cours du maximum du sursaut, au flux d'Eddington est egal a 0,94 (+0,26; −0,20)",

They are non-radial pulsators, with typical periods of 10 to 30 min, and their probable descendants are the shorter-period GW Vir (PG 1159-035) pulsating white dwarfs whose PNe have presumably dispersed. The pulsating PNNs are promising candidates for asteroseismological study, although there are already indications that such analyses will be complicated by highly variable power spectra. We present preliminary results from two campaigns of global photometry on the pulsating nuclei of NGC 1501 and Sanduleak 3, and from ground- and space-based searches for radial-mode pulsations in PNNs and white dwarfs.",

Model fits to the light curves give parallaxes for the events 267 and 291, and relative source sizes for 170 and 267. Selfconsistency arguments provide extra limits on the models of the event 291. As a result we obtain likelihood estimate of the lens mass for the event 170, mass measurement based on angular size and parallax for 267, and narrow limits on mass in the case of 291. Brown dwarfs are most likely candidates for some of the lens components. The influence of the binary lens rotation and the Earth parallax may be important but hard to distinguish when modeling relatively short lasting binary lens events.",

    "abstract": "We present new photometric and spectroscopic observations and analyses for the eclipsing binary systems V1241 Tau and GQ Dra. Our photometric light and radial velocity curves analyses combining with the TESS light curves show that both are conventional semi-detached binary systems. Their absolute parameters are also derived. We present the $O-C$ analyses of the systems and we propose the most possible orbital period modulating mechanisms. Furthermore, Fourier analyses are applied to the photometric residual data of the systems to check for the pulsational behavior of the components. We conclude that the primary component of the system GQ Dra is a $\\delta$ Sct type pulsator with a dominant pulsation frequency of 18.58 d$^{-1}$ based on our $B$ filter residual light curve although it can not be justified by 30-minute cadence TESS data. No satisfactory evidence of pulsational behaviour for V1241 Tau was verified. Finally, the evolutionary tracks of the components of both systems are calculated, while their locations within evolutionary diagrams are compared with other Algol-type systems.",

In the middle stage of superoutburst the period was increasing with a rate of $\\dot P/P = (21\\pm12)\\times 10^{-5}$ and later was decreasing with a rate of $\\dot P/P = -(21\\pm8)\\times 10^{-5}$. \r\nAt the end of superoutburst and during first dozen days of quiescence the star was showing late superhumps with a mean period of Plate = 0.06926(2) days. This phenomenon was observed even 30 days after beginning of the superoutburst. \r\nIn quiescence the star shows quasi-periodic modulations with amplitude reaching 0.5 mag. The most common structure observed during this stage was sinusoidal wave characterized by a period of about 0.1 days. \r\nComparing KS UMa to other SU UMa stars we conclude that this group of dwarf novae shows decreasing superhump periods at the beginning and the end of superoutburst but increasing period in the middle phase.",

Two objects with periods longer than 1 day are preliminarily classified as either spotted variables of BY Dra type or ellipsoidal variables. The most unusual of the identified variables, M22_V11, has I_C=19.9 and is located far to the red of the main sequence in the cluster color-magnitude diagram. It shows variability with a period as short as P=0.066 days or alternatively with P=0.132 days. We propose that it may be an ellipsoidal variable harboring a degenerate component.",

We present a simple method of correcting for this kind of errors.",

None of the Cepheid from our sample of 378 stars stopped pulsating. Also none of them showed a large period change which could indicate mode switching. However for Cepheids with log P > 0.9 we found significant period changes, positive as well as negative. A comparison between the observed period changes and theoretical predictions shows moderate agreement with some models (Bono et al. 2000), and a very large disagreement with others (Alibert et al. 1999). The large differences between the models are likely caused by the very high sensitivity of stellar evolution during core helium burning phase to even small changes in the input physics, as discovered by Lauterborn, Refsdal and Weigert (1971).",

Additionally, we include in our analysis, when possible, photometric data of the distance indicators in the metal poor Carina dwarf galaxy for which photometry was also collected during the OGLE-II experiment. The analysis is largely differential, free from zero point and extinction uncertainties. The main conclusion is that the distance scales resulting from all four stellar distance indicators are fully consistent with each other. Therefore the distance scale problem is not a problem resulting from different distances yielded by distance indicators, but rather a problem of the proper zero point of this common distance scale. All four stellar distance indicators have to be treated as an ensemble, and any determination of the zero point for one of them must predict reasonable luminosities of the others. This puts strong constraints on many proposed calibrations of distance indicators. For example, very bright calibrations of Cepheids or RR Lyr can practically be ruled out. (Abridged).",

    "abstract": "(Abridged) We analyze the UBVI color-magnitude diagrams towards the Galactic bulge in a relatively low-reddening region of Baade's Window. The dereddened red giant branch is very wide [~1.0 mag in (U-B)_0 and ~0.4 mag in (B-V)_0 and (V-I)_0], indicating a significant dispersion of stellar metallicities, which by comparison with the theoretical isochrones and data for Galactic clusters we estimate to lie between approximately -0.7< [Fe/H] < +0.3. We also discuss the metallicity dependence of the red clump I-band brightness and we show that it is between 0.1-0.2 mag dex^{-1}. This agrees well with the previous empirical determinations and the models of stellar evolution. \r\nThe de-reddened (V-I)_0 color of the red clump in the observed bulge field is = 1.066, sigma_{(V-I)_0} = 0.14, i.e. 0.056 mag redder than the local stars with good parallaxes measured by Hipparcos. When we use our data to re-derive the red clump distance to the Galactic center, we obtain the Galactocentric distance modulus \\mu_{0,GC}=14.69 +- 0.1 mag (R_0=8.67 +- 0.4 kpc), with error dominated by the systematics of photometric calibration. We then discuss the systematics of the red clump method and how they affect the red clump distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. We argue that the value of distance modulus \\mu_{0,LMC}=18.24 +- 0.08 (44.5 +- 1.7 kpc), recently refined by Udalski, is currently the most secure and robust of all LMC distance estimates. This has the effect of increasing any LMC-tied Hubble constant by about 12%, including the recent determinations by the HST Key Project and Sandage et al. \r\nThe UBVI photometry is available through the anonymous ftp service.",

Of the 15 consistently detected events, 7 had significant shifts which we were able to measure with a fair degree of confidence. Those events with large shifts are also expected to be unresolved with a background ``blend'', and thus, we suggest that we have identified events in the OGLE-1 catalog which are strongly blended. Though we concentrate on the OGLE-1 database, and use the DoPHOT package in order to perform our analysis, we suggest that this shift is a generic effect, and should be observable in any crowded field.",

Our deep VLA observations at 5 GHz did not reveal a radio core brighter than 0.5 mJy/beam at this frequency. Thus a distance to the source is evaluated using photometric -- redshift estimates of the faint galaxies in the optical field. The equipartition magnetic field and energy density in the source is calculated and compared with corresponding parameters of other `giant' radio sources known, showing extremely low values of both physical parameters of the source investigated. On the other hand, the age of relativistic electrons, and the advance speed of the `hot spot' in the source are typical for much smaller and brighter 3CR sources.",

There is some controversy about the stability of their I-band absolute magnitude, but it does not seem to be serious. No controversy was anticipated about their colors, with metal rich giants expected to be redder and cooler than the metal poor giants. The purpose of this paper is to point out that no such correlation is apparent between [Fe/H] and effective temperature as determined with Washington CCD photometry for the giants in Baade's Window. No explanation is offered for this surprising result. It is also unknown why the galactic bulge red clump giants are redder than the clump giants near the Sun by 0.2 mag in the (V-I) color.",

It is found that the observed light curve is incompatible with previous solutions based on the Russell model, but a respectable fit to the observed light curve can be achieved by assuming von Zeipel gravity darkening provided the system is allowed to be in marginal contact, which involves an unrealistically large change in the mass ratio to obtain the appropriate eclipse depths and light ratio. The alternative possibilities are considered that the primary is tidally distorted more than expected for its relative radius and the observed mass ratio or that von Zeipel gravity darkening is not appropriate for O-type stars and photometric effects exist which magnify the effects of the primary's physical distortions in the light curve. A solution is favored in which the ratio of radii is near 0.75 and the primary is very highly gravity darkened relative to von Zeipel's law.",

The hot radiation source at the secondary star is immersed in the chromosphere of the K giant, and the slight enhancements of a few UV absorption lines at secondary minimum are used to estimate chromospheric column densities. The variability and flatness of the spectrum is evidence for considering the object a main-sequence star accreting mass by way of Roche-lobe overflow at the rate of 5 X 10 to the minus 7 solar masses/yr. Thus 5 Ceti may represent the elusive rapid stage of mass transfer in which matter is lost from the shrinking Roche lobe of the more massive star. The Fe II UV spectrum in interacting binaries is also discussed.",

The observed light curves are fit to theoretical Roche-model light curves using the computer program described by Eaton (1986).

The lower-than-expected darkening observed is attributed to a reduced common-radiative-envelope temperature gradient, probably a result of circulation related to energy transfer between the components of V566 Oph.",
