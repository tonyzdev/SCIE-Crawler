This scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR protocol. A comprehensive search of four online databases (ERIC, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) was conducted using the search term classroom AND (acoustic* OR noise OR reverb*) AND health. Peer-reviewed journal articles were included if they were written in English, included children in the primary school age range (i.e. 5–12 years), and included a measure of children’s physical health. Eight papers out of the 407 papers returned in the search met the criteria to be included in the review. The results were analysed according to the effect of traffic noise, aircraft noise, and internal classroom noise on children’s physical health. The results were somewhat mixed, but overall they suggest that noise may have a negative effect on children’s physical health by inducing a stress response that results in asthma, fatigue, and headaches. Future research avenues are proposed to better understand the relationship between classroom acoustic conditions and children’s physical health.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Classrooms are important learning spaces, however, the acoustic conditions in these spaces can often be suboptimal. The aim of this scoping review, which used the PRISMA-ScR protocol, was to understand what is known from the literature about the effect of classroom acoustic treatment on students’ listening, learning, and well-being. Thirteen papers from the database searches were deemed relevant for the review. Information on the years of publication of the papers, the population studied, the types of acoustic treatment used, the measures and methods used to assess the effect of acoustic treatment, and the outcomes of the papers was gathered. Seven of the 13 studies reported positive effects of classroom acoustic treatment on student’s speech perception, attention, and well-being. Five studies reported both positive effects and no effect depending on the measure, condition, or population. The remaining study reported a negative effect of classroom acoustic treatment on children’s speech perception and listening effort. These findings suggest that the effect of ceiling and/or wall absorbers/diffusers on sound and reverberation in the room can help students’ speech perception, attention, reading, and well-being, but they may also reduce the speech transmission index resulting in increased listening effort. The limitations of the reviewed studies and avenues for future research on the effect of acoustic treatment on a broader range of listening, learning, and well-being outcomes for students are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Obtaining adequate numeracy skills and listening comprehension skills at primary school are vital for children’s future success. However, classrooms are often noisy and reverberant which may interfere with learning these skills. Two scoping reviews were conducted to synthesise research assessing the effect of different classroom acoustic conditions on (1) children’s numeracy performance and (2) children’s listening comprehension and to identify areas for future research. The PRISMA-ScR protocol was used for these scoping reviews. A comprehensive search of four online databases was conducted in September 2021 using the search term classroom AND ( noise OR reverberation OR acoustics ) AND ( numeracy OR math* OR arithmetic ) for the first scoping review, and in May 2022 using the search term classroom AND ( acoustic* OR noise OR reverb* ) AND (\" listening comprehension\" OR \"auditory comprehension\" OR \"spoken language comprehension\" OR \"speech comprehension ”) for the second scoping review. The effect of the acoustic conditions on children’s numeracy was varied with most studies showing a negative or no effect of noise, but two showed a positive effect. Therefore, future research is needed to better understand the effect of different classroom acoustic conditions on children’s numeracy performance. For listening comprehension overall, signal-to-noise ratios below + 10 dB mostly had a negative effect on children’s listening comprehension compared to quiet conditions; however, variables such as the noise type, signal-to-noise ratio tested, the listening comprehension domain examined, the population studied, and the voice used for the stimuli affected this. Future research avenues to better understand these effects are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An alternating tone sequence may be perceptually integrated into one stream or segregated into two streams based on pitch and timbre differences between the tones ( sequential stream segregation ). However, the effect of the spectral dispersion of harmonic complex tones on sequential stream segregation has been largely unexplored. We introduced band tones that were harmonic complex tones divided into several frequency bands, in which frequency components in every other frequency band were removed. Here, we show that segregation was reported more often with fewer frequency bands and larger separation in fundamental frequency. Listeners generally responded to 2–8-band stimuli as segregated most of the time. However, the percentages of segregation responses for 16-band stimuli were generally dominated by fundamental frequency separations and whether the movements of fundamental frequencies and band-like spectral patterns were congruent or incongruent. The results suggest that the auditory system cannot organize rapidly alternating frequency component blocks spanning a wide frequency range into one stream.",

This investigation utilises semi-analytical, numerical, and experimental methods to investigate the physics of the noise generation mechanisms, generated noise levels and the psychoacoustic characteristics of this noise. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and semi-analytical models are employed to predict the periodic unsteady loading on the rotor blades, and the loading data are used to predict the radiated noise for rotor systems with different blade rake angles. Experimental measurements of the noise produced by a rotor system with no blade rake angle were used as a baseline case, and predictions were used to synthesise and auralise the sound produced by rotor systems with different rake angles for psychoacoustic analysis. The results show that increasing the blade rake angle generally reduces the amplitude of prominent interaction tones due to the reduction in the unsteady loading along the blade span caused by bound potential field interactions as the blade rake angle increases. This causes a reduction in the perceived tonal noise level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the progress made in the last decades in the field of machine condition monitoring, there are still cases where the current state of the art is not enough and new technologies and advanced analysis methods are required to prevent unexpected failures. One example is planetary gearboxes (PGs), which are one of the main components of mechanical transmission systems in heavy-duty machines such as off-highway trucks, electric rope shovels, helicopters and wind turbines. Although those machines are usually equipped with vibration and temperature sensors to detect faults in mechanical components, these technologies might not be able to perform well under certain circumstances. Therefore, the applied investigation on new monitoring technologies in the field of machine condition monitoring is a necessary step. Among those, in this review the acoustic emission technology will be addressed as a tool for fault diagnosis of gear faults in PG.",

    "abstract": "Anyone seeking to control the risks from vibration transmitted to the hands and arms may contemplate the use of anti-vibration gloves. To make an informed decision about any type of personal protective equipment, it is necessary to have performance data that allow the degree of protection to be estimated. The information provided with an anti-vibration glove may not be easy to understand without some background knowledge of how gloves are tested and does not provide any clear route for estimating likely protection. Some of the factors that influence the potential efficacy of an anti-vibration glove include how risks from hand-arm vibration exposure are assessed, how the standard test for a glove is carried out, the frequency range and direction of the vibration for which protection is sought, how much hand contact force or pressure is applied and the physical limitations due to glove material and construction. This paper reviews some of the background issues that are useful for potential purchasers of anti-vibration gloves. Ultimately, anti-vibration gloves cannot be relied on to provide sufficient and consistent protection to the wearer and before their use is contemplated all other available means of vibration control ought first to be implemented.",

Acoustic beamforming is used to inspect the turbulent boundary layer-trailing edge noise emissions from the unmodified and serrated trailing edges. Different freestream velocities and angles of attack are investigated. The serration permeability is prescribed by having slits cut into the solid surface of the serrations in two different configurations. The results indicate that a certain benefit in noise reduction is obtained from a mixed solid/slitted configuration, while a fully slitted configuration loses most of the noise reduction performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the post-COVID era, face masks have become a part of our daily lives. However, the effects of these masks on Mandarin speech production remain unclear. This study aimed to address this research gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation of the impact of surgical face masks on vowel production. Vowels produced in a continuous speech context were recorded for 61 native Mandarin-speaking adults, both with and without wearing a face mask. The acoustic parameters associated with three corner vowels / i /, / a /, and / u / in Mandarin were measured. Significant changes were observed in the acoustic parameters under the masked condition, including an increase in F0 and a decrease in both F1 and F2 of vowel / a /, as well as tVSA, F1RR, and F2RR. However, no significant changes were found in duration and FCR. The patterns exhibited similarities between male and female speakers. The observed differences in vowel production can be attributed to the acoustic and physical consequences of wearing face masks. These differences, which may indirectly lead to reduced speech intelligibility, highlight the necessity of adopting adaptive strategies when face masks are present in various communication settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This manuscript describes a range of technical deliberations undertaken by the authors during their work as members of the Australian Government’s Independent Scientific Committee on Wind Turbines. Central to these deliberations was the requirement upon the committee to improve understanding and monitoring of the potential impacts of sound from wind turbines (including low frequency and infrasound) on health and the environment. The paper examines existing wind turbine sound limits, possible perceptual and physiological effects of wind turbine noise, aspects of the effects of wind turbine sound on sleep health and quality of life, low-frequency noise limits, the concept of annoyance including alternative causes of it and the potential for it to be affected by low-frequency noise, the influence of amplitude modulation and tonality, sound measurement and analysis and management strategies. In so doing it provides an objective basis for harmonisation across Australia of provisions for siting and monitoring of wind turbines, which currently vary from state to state, contributing to contention and potential inequities between Australians, depending on their place of residence.",

This paper presents a prototype of impedance tube together with the software solution published under open-source license. The prototype is developed specifically for experimental design of Helmholtz resonators. For room acoustic purposes, these are difficult to sufficiently characterize by other methods because of their highly frequency dependent complex-valued pressure reflection factor resulting in large phase shifts happening upon reflection. The main benefits of the presented method are the movable rigid termination operated by a stepper motor and the use of open-source libraries as well as widely available hardware for the whole measurement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The flow recirculation effect on the noise measurement of a multi-rotor unmanned aircraft system (UAS) hovering in a closed anechoic chamber is experimentally characterized in this work. The measured acoustic spectrogram reveals that the recirculation forms around 30 s after the UAS’s take-off, manifested as prominent fluctuations in blade passage frequency and its harmonics. However, the instantaneous overall sound pressure level shows no obvious increase with the development of the recirculation. The result indicates that the recirculation effect does not significantly change the total acoustic energy but increases the uncertainties in the spectral distribution, which can be quantified by spectral entropy. The quantitative analysis of different noise components shows that the recirculation has a minimal effect on the tonal noise levels but slightly increases the broadband noise level out of the rotors’ plane. The results from parametric tests suggest that this broadband noise increment has a positive correlation with the UAS’s hover height but a negative correlation with the UAS’s gross mass. The comparison with existing studies highlights the difference in the recirculation effect on the noise of isolated rotor(s) and free-flying multi-rotor UAS in confined spaces.",

    "abstract": "It has been extensively communicated that Health Canada's Community Noise and Health Study (CNHS) did not find positive associations between wind turbine noise (WTN) levels and any of the evaluated health outcomes, beyond an increase in the prevalence of high annoyance toward several wind turbine features. The authors emphasize that this general conclusion remains bound by the study strengths and limitations. Following the publication of the CNHS findings, there has been interest among some individuals to present alternative interpretations of the results originally reported by Michaud et al. (J Acoust Soc Am 139(3):1443–1454, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1121/1.4942391 ). While recognizing the importance of independent scientific re-evaluation and/or reinterpretation, this commentary serves to clarify and, where necessary, correct some of the information put forward by others. One factor that has been re-evaluated by external stakeholders is the subsample of participants that comprise the lowest WTN category. In their reanalysis, they have eliminated this category, or introduced alternative comparative data. This paper identifies substantial issues associated with the re-evaluation put forth. To thoroughly address these issues and to avoid further confusion or misinterpretation, the authors of the CNHS provide a comparison between the CNHS health condition prevalence data and nationally representative health-based surveys conducted in Canada during the same calendar year. In addition, this paper responds to comments received to date on the CNHS, including the study's age range, the generalization of findings, the provision of raw data, and conclusions on the association between WTN level and health.",

    "abstract": "Machinery supplied within the European Economic Area must comply with the noise requirements of Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. Machine manufacturers must reduce noise to the lowest level achievable and provide noise emission data so people can use their products without risk from noise. Declared noise emissions should help purchasers and users identify low or lower noise machinery and provide information that can be used to develop a noise risk assessment. Purchasing quieter machinery is an effective way to avoid risk from occupational exposure to high noise. It also minimises the cost and effort needed to control any remaining noise risk. Effective selection of machinery, however, on the basis of the declared noise emissions is dependent on a number of factors including: (a) The availability of competing machinery with significantly different noise risk. (b) Manufacturers’ declared noise emissions that are indicative of actual noise risk. (c) Purchasers who understand the declared noise emissions and other information describing noise risk. A preliminary market surveillance exercise across Europe found that compliance with the noise requirements of the Machinery Directive is very poor; noise information provided in 80 % of machinery instructions did not comply. Investigations of a small number of harmonised noise test codes identified a range of problems that limit the usefulness of the declared noise emissions to rank the noise of competing machinery and identify real use noise risk. Insufficient support is in place to help purchasers who want to “buy quiet”. To buy quiet in today’s market purchasers need a high level of understanding of noise and noise control and must have a high degree of determination to achieve noise control in their workplace. Purchasers who successfully buy quiet seek out quieter machines and critically review the noise information supplied with them, which is often flawed. Such purchasers sometimes need to write, and check conformity with, their own specification for noise. It is likely purchasers would have more success in buying quiet if: (a) More manufacturers complied with the noise requirements of the Machinery Directive. (b) The standards supplementing the noise requirements of the Machinery Directive were more reliable. (c) The availability of quieter equipment was more widely publicised.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An apparent disconnect exist in workplaces regarding identification of occupational hearing loss (OHL) and implementation of specific strategies to prevent progression of OHL, evident through continued high incidence of OHL. This scoping review aimed to identify evidence regarding targeted intervention used by industry, specifically to prevent the progression of OHL for workers. The scoping review was undertaken using the PRISMA-ScR methodology. Search terms were based on three broad categories, hearing loss, workplace, and intervention. Initially 1309 articles were identified for screening and 1,207 studies not meeting the criteria were excluded. Full text reviews of 102 articles were completed and a further 93 studies excluded. The scoping review produced nine studies which were quantitatively analysed. All interventions focused primarily on lower order controls, specifically administrative and personal protective equipment. Eight studies focused on awareness training, health monitoring, mandating hearing protection device use and fit testing, and using personal attenuation ratings as a predictor to OHL. Only one study mentioned isolation of workers from noise sources, and this was an interview study with workplace managers, not a specific intervention at a workplace. The result of the review highlights the lack of published literature on targeted interventions for workers with OHL. There is insufficient evidence to inform effective, impactful change in practice to prevent the progression of OHL. It is recommended that a system of collecting and assessing specific interventions and controls for workers with OHL be developed to better inform industry on strategies that will provide adequate protection for these workers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to determine if self-complete at-home recordings could produce audio samples of sufficient quality for use in voice analysis software, and if audio samples of similar or sufficient quality could be extracted from audio-recorded naturalistic phone interviews. Data were obtained from 31 adults aged 18 years and over who smoked. The /a/ sound segment was manually isolated, and analysis functions were used to produce the following values: fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, noise ratio, formant 3, and formant 4. The /a/ sound segment was then manually isolated from audio recordings of naturalistic interviews previously conducted by phone. These were analysed in the same way and compared for quality against Evistr-recorded audio samples from the same participants. A third audio sample consisted of an Evistr or phone-recorded sustained phonation of the /a/ sound. Means and standard deviations were calculated for the target vocal parameters. Statistical comparisons for quality of sound segment were conducted for readings, interviews, and vowel phonation and for sound signals extracted via both recording methods. Self-recording by adults who smoked provided audio samples of sufficient quality for analysis of vocal features that have been associated with a clinical outcome. The values obtained for sustained phonation audio samples displayed the least perturbation and noise for the vocal parameters surveyed. Sound signals recorded with smartphones appeared to be affected by electronic interference but have potential for use in diagnostic tools for measuring vocal parameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The impedance tube method is commonly employed to measure the acoustical properties of materials, but commercial versions are prohibitively expensive for researchers lacking access to well-funded acoustical laboratories. A significant expense in traditional impedance tube setups is the pressure field microphones. This study explores the feasibility of using low-cost consumer-grade electret microphones, which are substantially cheaper than their pressure field counterparts. Our impedance tube design was validated and tested with high-cost pressure field microphones, contrasting it with electret microphones priced under one US dollar (USD). The findings reveal that the sound absorption coefficient can still be effectively and accurately measured using inexpensive microphones, subject to suitable signal conditioning and accurate microphone calibration. The trade-off is a slight loss of accuracy for the low-end frequency range of &lt; 250 Hz.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines and compares methods of separating tonal and broadband components of the noise generated by small rotors as commonly found on small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS). Time synchronous analysis (TSA) methods with varying averaging algorithms, such as ensemble averaging (EA), exponential weighted moving averaging (EWMA) and Kalman filter averaging (KFA), are compared against themselves and against a cross-correlation-based method. The decomposition methods are used on noise measurements of a small isolated rotor under static operation and edgewise flight conditions at 10 m/s in the UNSW anechoic wind tunnel (UAT). The best method for isolating tones is TSA-EWMA and for isolating the broadband spectrum of noise is the cross-correlation method, based on the spectral reconstruction of the experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Long-term exposure to hand-arm vibration (HAV) from powered machinery is known to be responsible for damage to the hand and arm. To protect workers, employers are required to apply appropriate measures to control vibration exposures. A key part of the process of effective assessment and control of vibration risks is the evaluation of vibration exposures. The vibration data required for exposure evaluation need to be suitable and sufficient to enable the appropriate actions to be taken. In Great Britain, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has provided tools designed to simplify exposure evaluation as part of employers’ risk assessments for vibration. These tools help to demystify the process and help employers move as quickly as possible from the evaluation of exposures to actively controlling risk. This paper discusses the tools provided by HSE designed to support the HAV risk assessment process. It reviews existing tools including the “rule of thumb”, which provides an initial indicator to likely risks, and the points system and calculator tool, which simplify the exposure calculation processes. The paper also introduces a table of indicative vibration magnitudes, which has been developed for a revision of HSE guidance to help employers to achieve initial estimates of likely vibration exposures. The objective of all these tools is to enable employers to get efficiently from risk assessment to making decisions about the requirements for vibration control and getting those controls implemented.",

These sounds may arise from impact action tools, weaponry, and explosive events. The risk is normally associated with the instantaneous peak sound pressure level. Reliable measurement of these high-peak sound pressure levels can be challenging, particularly when special low-sensitivity microphones or transducers are required. It is also important that the health and safety practitioner is aware of the limitations of their instrumentation and the limitations of various types of measurement and analysis when sound is impulsive. Included here are tips from the author’s practical experience of testing the performance of noise measurement instrumentation and hearing protection in impulsive noise, and notes of standard methods to estimate the attenuation provided by hearing protection.",

The aim of this study was to measure the unoccupied noise levels and reverberation times of all of the classrooms in a typical Australian university to assess acoustic accessibility with a view to planning for a more accessible campus. A total of 166 classrooms were measured and categorised into good, ok, and poor classrooms according to the Macquarie University (MQU) Design Guidelines Review Performance Standards. Regarding unoccupied noise levels, 52% of classrooms were within the recommended &lt; 35 dBA limit. Regarding reverberation times, 65% of classrooms were within the recommended 0.4–0.6 s limit. Finally, 40% of classrooms met both the noise level and reverberation time limit. The plans at the university to incorporate these findings to make the campus more acoustically accessible are discussed, as well as future research avenues so that all students and teachers can flourish.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Anthropogenic disturbance, including noise, is a major cause of biodiversity decline worldwide. Especially in anurans, the effect of noise pollution is known to have major consequences on their reproduction since acoustic communication is an essential part of this process. In this study, we tested the effect of three levels of traffic noise (55 dB, 65 dB, and 75 dB) corresponding to three different distances from the road (200, 100, and 50 m, respectively) on the Brazilian Mundo Novo treefrog ( Boana marginata ). The results of the playback experiments showed an effect on call type B. More specifically, there was a decrease in the advertisement call rate, a reduction in the number of pulses, and a lengthening of the interval between pulses, particularly at 65 dB. These findings suggest that at distances of up to 100 m, the masking effect significantly influences acoustic communication on the species. However, a 55 dB stimulus—equal to 200 m from the road edge—did not change the call in this species, suggesting a minimal distance to implement noise-inflicting infrastructures. We recommend that new studies adopt sampling methods from this distance to refine the threshold of the traffic noise effect.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic insulation has been a longstanding challenge, persisting into the 21st century despite theoretical advancements, notably in sectors like vehicular refinement. Structural density constraints have posed significant setbacks, driving the emergence of promising solutions such as metamaterials, particularly local resonance metamaterials, which have overcome prior limitations. These advancements have unveiled new possibilities, including membrane-type metamaterials and double-wall arrays, demonstrating encouraging results for acoustic insulation in lightweight structures. Concurrently, recent studies have explored numerical methods and analytical models to understand the behavior of vibroacoustic systems based on metamaterials. Despite promising advancements, further work is needed to develop analysis methods that comprehensively describe the behavior of these emerging noise control systems, particularly within the context of product development. Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) stands out as a crucial technique in refining vibracoustic requirements and specifications during development schemes, contributing significantly to enhancing the quality, performance, and reliability of the final product. In the realm of metamaterial mechanics, coupling loss factors quantify the efficiency of energy transfer between subsystems. Various methods have been proposed for wave propagation analysis in metamaterials, notably the Plane Wave Expansion (PWE) method and the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM), each presenting advantages and disadvantages with implications for industrial applications. To address this, researchers have sought models to establish transmission factors for metamaterials, balancing simplifications with precision in vibroacoustic response description. Notably, efforts have been made to describe coupling loss factors in metamaterials, yet challenges persist in addressing acoustic volume interaction. This work aims to present a method for calculating coupling loss factors in acoustic insulation systems based on metamaterials within double-wall arrays, using a Potential-Dissipative Transmission Model (PDTM) with concentrated parameters. The study concludes that integrating the PDTM with SEA achieves a remarkable level of numerical precision in analyzing membrane-type metamaterials within double-wall configurations, particularly at operational frequencies exceeding membrane resonance. While acknowledging potential alternatives, such as hybridizing the TMM with impedance characterization, the PDTM shows promising initial approximations. Further exploration is warranted, particularly in refining methodologies for industrial applications, emphasizing the scalability and robustness of PDTM-based models. Notably, the PDTM demonstrates remarkable sensitivity in estimating metamaterial resonance frequencies, although efficacy may reduce near cavity resonance perturbations. Careful consideration of analytical methodology selection, especially concerning critical frequency points, is advised.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Helmholtz equation has been used for modeling the sound pressure field under a harmonic load. Computing harmonic sound pressure fields by means of solving Helmholtz equation can quickly become unfeasible if one wants to study many different geometries for ranges of frequencies. We propose a machine learning approach, namely a feedforward dense neural network, for computing the average sound pressure over a frequency range. The data are generated with finite elements, by numerically computing the response of the average sound pressure, by an eigenmode decomposition of the pressure. We analyze the accuracy of the approximation and determine how much training data is needed in order to reach a certain accuracy in the predictions of the average pressure response.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultrasonic probes for high-temperature applications are provided with metallic wedges, which can withstand the contact with the high temperature of the inspected structure. The ultrasonic signal travels within the wedge and gets reflected from its boundaries, causing interference signals called “ghost echoes”. The current work presents an investigation of the additional damping effect provided by porous sintered metal plates applied onto the surface of the wedge. In particular, the study evaluates the effect of damping plate thickness on the interference signal level at different transmission frequencies. Damping plates made of sintered metal SIKA-R 15 AX were attached to a wedge prototype made of steel 1.4301. The study revealed, that the most effective thickness of damping plates in the selected frequency interval of 1 to 4 MHz is equal to 4 mm. The evaluation of the interference signal has shown that the application of such damping plates to the wedge surface contributes to an additional attenuation of an interference signal of 10 to 30 dB after 500 µs of signal propagation.",

The psychological factors related to the degree of disturbance, concentration, and stress, as measured by subjective evaluation, were compared with the degree of physiological stress, as measured using salivary alpha-amylase activity. The results indicated that human speech and chewing sounds caused similar levels of psychological stress while performing intellectual tasks; however, chewing sounds caused comparatively less physiological stress than did human speech sounds. These findings suggest that depending on the sound stimulus, psychological and physiological stress characteristics may not coincide.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An experimental study on the effect of the speech characteristics of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and speech rate on the intelligibility of announcements at railway stations was conducted using an artificial synthetic voice. Synthesized speech has recently been used in noisy environments both indoors and outdoors, but unlike its use in quiet environments, when the environment is noisy, the intelligibility of announcements may be reduced. For railway station announcements, while natural spoken voices are currently used for multilingual announcements and disaster response broadcasts, deep neural network synthesized voices, which use deep learning, have also been adopted. However, the effect of the acoustic characteristics such as the SNR and speech rate on the intelligibility of reproduced announcements in noisy public spaces such as railway stations has not yet been clarified from a practical viewpoint. In this paper, in order to determine the appropriate SNR and speech rate for synthetic voice announcements in railway stations, auditory impressions of announcements with varying SNR and speech rate were evaluated by participants using a five-point scale. Based on the evaluations, the appropriate conditions for the broadcast of synthetic voice announcements at the ticket gate and on the platform of a station are discussed.",
