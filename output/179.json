    "abstract": "Caudipteryx zoui is a small enigmatic theropod known from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of the People's Republic of China. From the time of its initial description, this taxon has stimulated a great deal of ongoing debate regarding the phylogenetic relationship between non-avialan theropods and birds (Avialae) because it preserves structures that have been uncontroversially accepted as feathers (albeit aerodynamically unsuitable for flight). However, it has also been proposed that both the relative proportions of the hind limb bones (when compared with overall leg length), and the position of the center of mass in Caudipteryx are more similar to those seen in extant cusorial birds than they are to other non-avialan theropod dinosaurs. This conclusion has been used to imply that Caudipteryx may not have been correctly interpreted as a feathered non-avialan theropod, but instead that this taxon represents some kind of flightless bird. We review the evidence for this claim at the level of both the included fossil specimen data, and in terms of the validity of the results presented. There is no reason-phylogenetic, morphometric or otherwise-to conclude that Caudipteryx is anything other than a small non-avialan theropod dinosaur.",

The phylogeny of Ordovician Conodontophorida from the Baltic region is reconstructed and homologization of elements of the natural assemblages is presented. A reconstruction of the apparatus of Spathognathodontidae indicates that it was a bilateral medial organ composed of 14 conodonts with dentides turned inwards. Attempts are made to homologize the tissue of conodonts Panderodontidac with enamel of dermal dentides of lower Ve,tebrata and the basal filling tissue with dentine. A common phenomenon in conodont evolution is the occurrence of morphological gradient within the apparatus. The evolutionary changes are introduced polarly, and successively spread from the most rapidly evolving element on the adjoining ones. Fifty six species and subspecies of Ordovician conodonts are illustrated and their synonymes given. Two new suborders, three genera, seven species and three temporal subspecies are proposed.

    "abstract": "We propose a phylogeny of all major groups of Mesozoic mammals based on phylogenetic analyses of 46 taxa and 275 osteological and dental characters, using parsimony methods (Swofford 2000). Mammalia sensu lato (Mammaliaformes of some authors) are monophyletic. Within mammals, Sinoconodon is the most primitive taxon. Sinoconodon, morganu− codontids, docodonts, and Hadrocodium lie outside the mammalian crown group (crown therians + Monotremata) and are, successively, more closely related to the crown group. Within the mammalian crown group, we recognize a funda− mental division into australosphenidan (Gondwana) and boreosphenidan (Laurasia) clades, possibly with vicariant geo− graphic distributions during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. We provide additional derived characters supporting these two ancient clades, and we present two evolutionary hypotheses as to how the molars of early monotremes could have evolved. We consider two alternative placements of allotherians (haramiyids + multituberculates). The first, supported by strict consensus of most parsimonious trees, suggests that multituberculates (but not other alllotherians) are closely re− lated to a clade including spalacotheriids + crown therians (Trechnotheria as redefined herein). Alternatively, allotherians can be placed outside the mammalian crown group by a constrained search that reflects the traditional emphasis on the uniqueness of the multituberculate dentition. Given our dataset, these alternative topologies differ in tree−length by only ~0.6% of the total tree length; statistical tests show that these positions do not differ significantly from one another. Simi− larly, there exist two alternative positions of eutriconodonts among Mesozoic mammals, contingent on the placement of other major mammalian clades. Of these, we tentatively favor recognition of a monophyletic Eutriconodonta, nested within the mammalian crown group. We suggest that the “obtuse−angle symmetrodonts” are paraphyletic, and that they lack reliable and unambiguous synapomorphies.",

This pa− per reviews the definitions and ascribed functions of gastroliths. According to the suggested definition, gastroliths are hard objects within the digestive tract of animals—without specification of the mechanisms that are responsible for their accumulation. To further improve definitions, the origin−based terms “bio−gastrolith”, “patho−gastrolith”, and “geo− gastrolith” are introduced. The term “exolith” is introduced for isolated clasts with a possible history as geo−gastroliths. Hypotheses about the function of stomach stones in fossil and extant taxa are reviewed, discussed and supplemented with new research. Trituration and mixing of foodstuff are the generally accepted functions of gastroliths in many vertebrates, including birds. In contrast, ballast provided by swallowed stones is considered to be of limited importance for buoyancy in aquatic animals. Other functional hypotheses include mineral supply and storage, stomach cleaning, maintenance of a beneficial microbial gut flora, destruction of parasites and alleviation of hunger. Accidental ingestion of sediment, either by being mistaken for prey, by being attached to it, during playing or due to pathological behaviour, is considered to be common. Different functions may overlap in various taxa.",

Sauroposeidon proteles is a large brachiosaurid sauropod recently described from the Antlers Formation (Aptian-Albian) of southeastern Oklahoma. Sauroposeidon represents the culmination of brachiosaurid trends toward lengthening and lightening the neck, and its cervical vertebrae are characterized by extensive pneumatic structures. The elaboration of vertebral air sacs during sauropod evolution produced a variety of internal structure types. We propose anew classification system for this array of vertebral characters, using computed tomography (CT) of pneumatic internal structures. Comparisons with birds suggest that the vertebrae of sauropods were pneumatized by a complex system of air sacs in the thorax and abdomen. The presence of a thoraco-abdominal air sac system in sauropods would dramatically affect current estimates of mass, food intake, and respiratory requirements. Sauroposeidon was one of the last sauropods in the Early Cretaceous of North America; sauropods disappeared from the continent by the early Cenomanian. The demise of sauropods in the Early Cretaceous of North America predates significant radiations of angiosperms, so the decline and extinction of this dinosaur group cannot be linked to changes in flora.",

    "abstract": "The contemporary “two-step model” of growth of the scleractinian skeleton is based mostly on transversely sectioned samples. According to this model, many skeletal elements e.g., septa are formed in two temporally distinct phases represented by (1) “centers of calcification” that are composed of homogenously distributed microcrystalline or/and organic components and serve as scaffolding for the further growth of (2) fibrous skeleton. Based on transverse and longitudinal sections and histochemical staining techniques, I demonstrate herein that in extant corals (i.e., Stephanocyathus, Flabellum, Desmophyllum, “Ceratotrochus”, Galaxea, Platygyra), the entire septal skeleton is composed of superimposed layers of mineral and organic-enriched phases. These may be interrupted in some directions of growth but in other directions there is continuity between “centers of calcification” and “fibers”, making any distinction between these two structures unclear. As an alternative to the “two-step model”, a “layered model” of skeletal growth is proposed, that explains the differences between “centers of calcification” and “fibers” in terms of differential growth dynamics between these regions. Instead of the traditional but inadequate “trabecular” and “centers of calcification” concepts, a distinction between deposits of the Rapid Accretion Front (dRAF; which in particular cases can be organized into Centers of Rapid Accretion (CRA), and Thickening Deposits (TD) is proposed. In the dRAF region, mineral components, ca. 50 nm in diameter, seem to match the size range of nodular structures recently interpreted as nascent CaCO3 crystals. Remarkable regularity of the mineral/organic phase alternations (microbanding) in the TD skeleton of zooxanthellate corals and lack of such regular microbanding in azooxanthellate coralla is a promising criterion for distinguishing these two ecological coral groups on a skeletal basis, and one that could be applicable to fossils.",

They are assigned to a new genus and species, Sinornithomimus dongi. The anatomy of the species is described. Comparative and phylogenetic studies of ornithomimosaurs prove that these skeletons represent a new taxon that is more derived than Archaeornithomimus and more basal than the clade of [(Anserimimus + Gallimimus) + [Struthiomimus + (Dromiceiomimus + Ornithomimus)]]. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that the struc− ture of the hand is similar to Archaeornithomimus and represents an intermediate condition between the primitive (Harpymimus) and the derived (Anserimimus, Gallimimus, Struthiomimus, Dromiceiomimus, and Ornithomimus) condi− tions. The monophyly of Ornithomimidae is supported by a single synapomorphy (arctometatarsalian condition) in this analysis, indicating that the family is not as strongly supported as previously suggested. The analysis also implies that the shape of the rhamphotheca in North American taxa may have been different from that in Asian taxa. Previous study suggests herbivorous habits of this dinosaur based on characteristics of the gastroliths. The skeletons of Sinornithomimus were col− lected from a single monospecific bonebed with a high ratio of juvenile individuals (11 of the 14), suggesting gregarious be− havior for protection from predators. The abundance of juveniles indicates high mortality of juveniles or a catastrophic mass mortality of a population with a high proportion of juveniles. An increase in the relative ratio of the tibia to femur through the ontogeny of Sinornithomimus suggests higher cursoriality in adult individuals than in juveniles.",

Our studies of such limestones from a sequence of Late Jurassic open marine sediments exposed in central Poland revealed them as products of in situ calcified mats of benthic coccoid cyanobacteria. Remains of the cyanobacteria are visible in scanning electron microscope (SEM) images as characteristic patterns closely resembling the common mucilage sheaths of modern entophysalidacean and/or pleurocapsalean cyanobacteria comparable to those we found producing micritic and peloidal microbialites in Lake Van, Turkey. We suggest, by analogy, that many subtidal micritic and peloidal limestones common in the marine sedimentary record might be products of similar in situ calcified cyanobacterial microbiota. Such an intensive calcification of marine cyanobacteria could have proceeded only in environments more than modern seawater supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate minerals. Advection of excess alkalinity, originating from deeper, anaerobic or dysaerobic zones to shallow water areas is proposed as the main factor enhancing colonization of extensive sea bottom areas by the alkaliphilic cyanobacteria and promoting their in vivo calcification.",

    "abstract": "A current paradigm accepts the presence of weakly biomineralized animals only, barely above a low metazoan grade of organization in the terminal Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran), and a later, early Cambrian burst of well skeletonized animals.Here we report new assemblages of primarily calcareous shelly fossils from upper Ediacaran (553-542 Ma) carbonates of Spain and Russia (Siberian Platform).The problematic organism Cloudina is found in the Yudoma Group of the southeastern Siberian Platform and different skeletal taxa have been discovered in the terminal Neoproterozoic of several provinces of Spain.New data on the morphology and microstructure of Ediacaran skeletal fossils Cloudina and Namacalathus indicate that the Neoproterozoic skeletal organisms were already reasonably advanced.In total, at least 15 skeletal metazoan genera are recorded worldwide within this interval.This number is comparable with that known for the basal early Cambrian.These data reveal that the terminal Neoproterozoic skeletal bloom was a real precursor of the Cambrian radiation.Cloudina , the oldest animal with a mineralised skeleton on the Siberian Platform, characterises the uppermost Ediacaran strata of the Ust'-Yudoma Formation.While in Siberia Cloudina co-occurs with small skeletal fossils of Cambrian aspect, in Spain Cloudina-bearing carbonates and other Ediacaran skeletal fossils alternate with strata containing rich trace fossil assemblages.These finds treated together provide a possibility to correlate transitional Neoproterozoic-lower Cambrian strata around the world.Such a correlation concurs with available isotope and radiometric data and indicates that typical Ediacaran shelly fossils have not crossed the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary.",

    "abstract": "Several hundred disarticulated dinosaur bones have been recovered from a large quarry at Wulaga (Heilongjiang Province, China), in the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Yuliangze Formation.The Wulaga quarry can be regarded as a monodominant bonebed: more than 80% of the bones belong to a new lambeosaurine hadrosaurid, Sahaliyania elunchunorum gen.et sp.nov.This taxon is characterised by long and slender paroccipital processes, a prominent lateral depression on the dorsal surface of the frontal, a quadratojugal notch that is displaced ventrally on the quadrate, and a prepubic blade that is asymmetrically expanded, with an important emphasis to the dorsal side.Phylogenetic analysis shows that Sahaliyania is a derived lambeosaurine that forms a monophyletic group with the corythosaur and parasauroloph clades.Nevertheless, the exact position of Sahaliyania within this clade cannot be resolved on the basis of the available material.Besides Sahaliyania, other isolated bones display a typical hadrosaurine morphology and are referred to Wulagasaurus dongi gen.et sp.nov., a new taxon characterised by the maxilla pierced by a single foramen below the jugal process, a very slender dentary not pierced by foramina, and by the deltopectoral crest (on the humerus) oriented cranially.Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Wulagasaurus is the most basal hadrosaurine known to date.Phylogeographic data suggests that the hadrosaurines, and thus all hadrosaurids, are of Asian origin, which implies a relatively long ghost lineage of approximately 13 million years for basal hadrosaurines in Asia.",

Their nasals are fused and vaulted, suggesting that these elements braced the cranium against high feeding forces. Exceptionally high strengths of maxillary teeth in Tyrannosaurus rex indicate that it could exert relatively greater feeding forces than other tyrannosaurids. Areas and second moments of area of the nasals, calculated from CT cross−sections, show higher nasal strengths for large tyrannosaurids than for Allosaurus fragilis. Cross−sectional geometry of theropod crania reveals high second moments of area in tyrannosaurids, with resulting high strengths in bending and torsion, when compared with the crania of similarly sized theropods. In tyrannosaurids trends of strength increase are positively allomeric and have similar allometric expo− nents, indicating correlated progression towards unusually high strengths of the feeding apparatus. Fused, arched nasals and broad crania of tyrannosaurids are consistent with deep bites that impacted bone and powerful lateral movements of the head for dismembering prey.",

In order to determine phylogenetic versus scaling factors influencing bone histology, S. geographicus is compared with related podocnemid Podocnemis erythrocephala, and with fossil and Recent pelomedusoides taxa Bothremys barberi, Taphrosphys sulcatus, “Foxemys cf.

Potential scaling effects on bone histology were further investigated by comparison to the Pleistocene giant tortoise Hesperotestudo (Caudochelys) crassiscutata and the Late Cretaceous marine protostegid turtle Archelon ischyros. A diploe structure of the shell with well developed external and internal cortices framing inte− rior cancellous bone is plesiomorphic for all sampled taxa. Similarly, the occurrence of growth marks in the shell ele− ments is interpreted as plesiomorphic, with the sampled neural elements providing the most extensive record of growth marks. The assignment of S. geographicus to the Podocnemidae was neither strengthened nor refuted by the bone his− tology. A reduced thickness of the internal cortex of the shell elements constitutes a potential synapomorphy of the Bothremydidae.

    "abstract": "Although living sloths (Xenarthra, Tardigrada) are represented by only two genera, their fossil relatives form a large and diverse group. The evolution of hypsodonty, the crown height of a tooth, has traditionally been viewed as a response to di− etary shifts toward abrasive vegetation. But recent work indicates that hypsodonty is also due to the higher prevalence of grit and dust in more open environments. The teeth of sloths are both high−crowned and open−rooted, or hypselodont, but distinctions between the selective factors acting to produce differing degrees of hypsodonty have not been rigorously con− sidered. A comparative analysis of hypsodonty was performed in eleven species of Pleistocene sloths. It suggests that dif− ferences in hypsodonty may be explained by dietary preferences, habitat and habits. Among mylodontids, morphologic and biomechanical analyses indicate that hypsodonty was unlikely to be due solely to feeding behavior, such as grazing. Some mylodontids (e.g., Scelidotherium leptocephalum, Lestodon armatus, Glossotherium robustum, Mylodon darwini) were capable diggers that likely dug for food, and ingestion of abrasive soil particles probably played a considerable role in shaping their dental characteristics. Increased hypsodonty over time in Paramylodon harlani, however, is apparently due to a change in habitat from closed to more open environments. Geographical distributions of the megatheriids Eremotherium and Megatherium indicate differing habitats as possible factors in hypsodonty differences. In summary, among Tardigrada hypsodonty is apparently affected by diet, habitat and habit. The absence of enamel must be responsi− ble for much of the hypsodonty observed in xenarthrans, which obscures the interpretation of contribution of each of the mentioned factors.",

The morphology of the hand a nd footprints suggest that the tracks and trackways were made by hadrosaurs, and the ichnites might represent the earliest record of these dinosaurs. Amblydactylus tracks were made in a wide variety of depositional environments, including the mud beneath several metres of water. Juveniles were gregarious and stayed together after hatching until they were large enough to join herds of more mature animals. Hadrosaur herds appear to have walked side by side, seldom crossing paths, although there was little structure to the herds when they were in the water and/or feeding. Calculation of the walking speeds indicate that the herbivores were generally slower than the carnivores.",

The SSF assemblage comprises disarticulated sclerites of chancelloriids, halkieriids, tommotiids, lapworthellids, palaeoscolecids, hyolithelminths, lingulate brachiopods, helcionelloid molluscs, hyoliths, and bradoriids. All 24 described species are common to Antarctica and Australia. Most are recorded here from Antarctica for the first time, including Shetlandia multiplicata gen. et sp. nov. and two new species Byronia? bifida and Hadimopanella staurata. The lithological and fossil contents of the boulders are almost identical with autochthonous assemblages from the Shackleton Limestone in the Argentina Range and Transantarctic Mountains. Cambrian outcrops around the Weddell Sea are a plausible source of the erratics. The fauna is closely similar to that from the uppermost Botomian Wilkawillina Limestone in the Flinders Ranges and Parara Limestone on Yorke Peninsula, and Toyonian Wirrealpa and Aroona Creek Limestones in the Flinders Ranges, as well as the Ramsay Limestone on Yorke Peninsula, all in the Arrowie and Stansbury Basins of South Australia. These very similar faunal and facies successions for Antarctica and Australia strongly support their common biotic and sedimentary evolution on the same margin of a greater Gondwana supercontinent throughout the Early Cambrian.",

Studies were based on material etched from the core of Mielnik on the Bug (Eastern Poland) deep boring, and partly on erratic boulders of Baltic origin. In Lower Ludlovian Neocucullograptinae n. subfam. were represented by Bohemograptus , which on the boundary with Upper Ludlovian acquired the capability to produce microfusellar tissue. Further evolution of Neocucullograptinae n. subfam. marked by appearance of specialized representatives of Upper Ludlovian Bohemograptus, Neolobograptus n. gen. and Neocucullograptus n. gen., was closely connected with the utilisation of this peridermal fabric. Last named forms constitute characteristic elements of graptolite fauna in the Siedlce Beds of the Polish Platformian Silurian, which enable subdivision of their lower member into 5 new graptolite zones. Occurrence of this fauna on other areas of Eastern and Central Europe is indicated. Nature of changes in graptolite fauna on the boundary of Lower and Upper Ludlovian is discussed, and the probable role of biotic factors in extinction of Graptoloidea is emphasized. Origin and tentative phylogeny of Neocucullograptinae n. subfam. are discussed and probable biological interpretation of observed changes suggested. Quantitative analysis of long-lasted Bohemograptus bohemicus (Barr.) lineage has been given, and on the base of available evidence, a discrimination of two temporal subspecies is substantiated. Eight representatives (species and subspecies) of the Neocucullograptinae n. subfam. are described in systematic part. Three species and one subspecies are new.

Here we pres− ent the results of a phylogenetic analysis using 195 characters scored for four outgroup and 13 maniraptoriform (ingroup) terminal taxa, including new data on oviraptorids. This analysis places Oviraptorosauria within Avialae, in a sister−group relationship with Confuciusornis. Archaeopteryx, Therizinosauria, Dromaeosauridae, and Ornithomimosauria are suc− cessively more distant outgroups to the Confuciusornis−oviraptorosaur clade.

The gradual transformation of uncoiled to coiled ammonoid conchs has essential functional consequences. The radical change in conch geometry during phylogeny but also in ontogeny of early ammonoids implies a shift of the aperture from an original roughly downward, via a downward oblique and an upward oblique to an upward orientation, presuming a neutrally buoyant condition of the ammonoid animal. Similar trends were reconstructed for the three main ammonoid lineages in the Middle Devonian, the agoniatitid, the anarcestid, and the tornoceratid lineages. This allowed an increase in manoeuvrability and in the maximum horizontal swimming speed.",

    "abstract": "Numerous paleontologists have noted wear facets on tyrannosaurid lateral teeth over the past century. While several workers have proposed explanations for these features, there remains to this day no consensus concerning their etiology. Here we report on an examination of wear surfaces on these teeth from the Upper Cretaceous (mid−Campanian) Judith River Group of southern Alberta, Canada. This study reveals two distinct types of wear features on the labial and lingual sides of tyrannosaurid lateral teeth: irregular “spalled” surfaces and wear facets. The irregular spalled surfaces typically extend to the apex of the tooth, which evidently reflects flaking of enamel resulting from forces produced during contact between tooth and food. These surfaces are often rounded, presumably from antemortem wear following spalling. Wear striations on these surfaces are oriented heterogeneously. The wear facets, in contrast, occur on only one side of the tooth and are typically elliptical in outline and evince parallel wear striations. Similar patterns of parallel wear striations in ex− tant mammals reflect tooth−tooth contact. We therefore propose that wear facets in tyrannosaurids were formed by re− peated tooth−tooth contact between the lingual side of maxillary teeth and labial side of dentary teeth. It remains unclear whether this contact was serendipitous or adaptive, though it appears to be unusual for reptiles, as we have found no evidence for wear facets in extant varanids and crocodilians.",

The analysis of cranial characters and comparison of postcranial features reveal that Tarbosaurus bataar is not the sister taxon of Tyrannosaurus rex (contra Holtz 2001).

Our results show that the two eutherian taxa grew relatively slowly with pe− riodic pauses in growth indicated by the presence of rest lines, while the multituberculates and Morganucodon had a faster rate of bone formation that suggests an overall rapid growth rate that slowed down later in ontogeny. Compari− sons of the early mammalian bone microstructure with that of non−mammalian cynodonts, extant monotremes, and placentals are also made, and significant differences in the rate of osteogenesis in the various groups are documented. Our findings suggest differences in the growth rate between the multituberculates and the Mesozoic eutherians, and moreover, both groups appear to have slower growth rates as compared to modern monotremes and placentals. Our re− sults further suggest that the determinate growth strategy typical of extant mammals evolved early in the evolution of the non−mammalian therapsids. We speculate that the sustained, uninterrupted bone formation among the multi− tuberculates may have been an adaptive attribute prior to the K−T event, but that the flexible growth strategy of the early eutherians was more advantageous thereafter.",

The Asturian tracks show a high degree of morphological similarity to other specimens previously described as possible turtle tracks.

    "abstract": "Newly recovered fossil proboscideans and embrithopods from Chilga, Ethiopia are described and evaluated taxonomi− cally. They are dated to ca. 28–27 Ma (late Oligocene), temporally intermediate between late Eocene–early Oligocene Afro−Arabian faunas dominated by archaic, endemic taxa, and replacement faunas of the early Miocene marked by a mas− sive influx of Eurasian migrants. The paucity of similar−aged sites in Afro−Arabia makes Chilga critical for delineating the initiation and sequence of this faunal turnover. While most of the genera present at Chilga persist from older Afro−Arabian localities, at higher elevation and farther inland than elsewhere, there are no Eurasian mammals in the fauna. However, the archaic endemics from Chilga differ morphometrically from their older congeners, and include a new embrithopod, Arsinoitherium giganteum sp. nov., and novel species of elephantiform proboscideans, Phiomia major sp. nov., aff. Palaeomastodon sp. nov. A, and aff. Palaeomastodon sp. nov. B. New, primitive deinotheres and gompho− theres also occur at Chilga, extending the fossil records of these proboscideans considerably back in time. The Chilga deinothere, Chilgatherium harrisi sp. nov., differs sufficiently from Prodeinotherium and Deinotherium to be placed in its own subfamily, Chilgatheriinae subfam. nov. The Chilga gomphothere is smaller than Miocene elephantoids, and is referred to cf. Gomphotherium sp. nov. Together, this evidence suggests that indigenous Afro−Arabian taxa had greater ecological versatility than previously suspected and continued to enjoy successful evolutionary trajectories into the late Paleogene. Thus, as they spread into Afro−Arabia, new immigrants from Eurasia may have encountered vibrant local mammalian communities. The demise of many endemic inhabitants followed and remains poorly understood.",

The material includes a distal left femur and an articulated right pes, including the astragalus, distal tarsals, and metatarsals I–IV. The material is referable to Sauropodomorpha and represents a non− eusauropod, sauropodomorph more derived than the most basal members of Sauropodomorpha (e.g., Saturnalia, Theco− dontosaurus, Efraasia, and Plateosaurus) based on a combination of plesiomorphic and derived character states. Several autapomorphies present in both the femur and metatarsus suggest that this material represents a distinct sauropodomorph taxon, herein named Glacialisaurus hammeri gen. et sp. nov. Some of the derived characters present in the Antarctic taxon suggest affinities with Coloradisaurus and Lufengosaurus (e.g., proximolateral flange on plantar surface of meta− tarsal II, well−developed facet on metatarsal II for articulation with medial distal tarsal, subtrapezoidal proximal surface of metatarsal III). Preliminary phylogenetic analyses suggest a close relationship between the new Antarctic taxon and Lufengosaurus from the Early Jurassic Lufeng Formation of China. However, the lack of robust support for the taxon’s phylogenetic position, and current debate in basal sauropodomorph phylogenetics limits phylogenetic and biogeographic inferences drawn from this analysis. The new taxon is important for establishing the Antarctic continent as part of the geo− graphic distribution of sauropodomorph dinosaurs in the Early Jurassic, and recently recovered material from the Hanson Formation that may represent a true sauropod, lends support to the notion that the earliest sauropods coexisted with their basal sauropodomorph relatives for an extended period of time.",

Bifurcation of the neural spines separated the paired supraspinal ligament into two sheets. A paired interspinal septum was attached to the cranial and caudal margins of the neural spines. The dorsal and the lateral portions of the cervical musculature must have been strongly segmented, whereas the laterocostal portion was divided with one myoseptum per vertebral segment. The hypaxial cervical muscle was most probably small and only poorly segmented. In Diplodocidae and Dicraeosauridae, the distribution of external pneumatic structures is similar, whereas only Diplodocidae possess intraosseous pneumatic struc− tures. Supravertebral pneumatic diverticula are reconstructed for both groups, which, together with dorsal ligaments filled the gap between the metapophyses of bifurcate neural spines. Comparisons between the vertebrae of juvenile and adult diplodocids strongly indicate that pneumatisation proceeded from the supramedullary diverticula into the neural arch and the neural spine. The regular branching pattern of the pneumatic cavities as well as the vertical I−beam construc− tion of the vertebral corpora is interpreted as a consequence of the biomechanical constraints of the vertebral corpora in diplodocids. These reconstructions form the ground for functional morphological considerations in Diplodocidae and Dicraeosauridae while addressing the possible mechanical consequences of pneumatic structures for the integrity of the support system of the neck.",

History of the Triassic land vertebrates comprises three successive global epoches referred to as proterosuchian, kannemeyeroid and dinosaur ones. The earliest and the middle epoches are typified by the regional faunal sequence of East Europe. The proterosuchian time spaas here the Neorhachitome and Parotosuchus faunas, the former being directly correlated with the Induan-Lower Olenekian, and the latter with the Upper Olenekian (Spathian). The Eryosuchus and Mastodonsaurus faunas of the kannemeyeroid epoch in East Europe are Middle Triassic in age and correspond to the Muschelkalk and Lettenkohle respectively. An evidence is brought for contemporaneity of the proterosuchian-kannemeyeroid biotic replacement in Laurasia and Gondwana. This implies the Middle Triassic age of the Cynognathus Zone of South Africa and its equivalents in South America.

The most abundant trace fossils are Gnathichnus pentax and Radulichnus inopinatus, produced by the grazing activity of echinoids and polyplacophorans upon algae and other microorganisms coating shell surfaces. Other bioerosion traces include polychaete dwellings (Caulostrepsis taeniola and Maeandropolydora sulcans), sponge boring systems (Entobia isp.), and rare bryozoan bor− ings (Pinaceocladichnus isp.), predation structures (Oichnus simplex and repaired durophagous scars), and foraminiferal fixation pits (Centrichnus cf. eccentricus). The trace fossil assemblage records short−term bioerosion in shellgrounds in a moderate energy setting as evinced by the dominance of epigenic or shallow endogenic structures produced in most cases by “instantaneous” behaviors. The assemblage can be assigned to the Gnathichnus ichnofacies, and it contrasts with that found in Pliocene rocky shores in the same geographic area, which are examples of the Entobia ichnofacies. The Gnathichnus ichnofacies is validated as an archetypal one and its recurrency demonstrated since the Jurassic. Entobia and Gnathichnus ichnofacies have to be used in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic as substitutes of the previously existing Trypanites ichnofacies, which is still valid in the Palaeozoic.",

Polonica, 38, 1-2, 3-47, 19&7. A collection of multituberculates consisting of 68 specimens (teeth or their fragments and jaw fragments) from the ?Aptian or Albian Khovboor Beds in the Gobi Desert is described. It contains four species: Eobaatar magnus gen. n., sp. n., and E. minor sp. n. (assigned to the Eobaataridae nov. in Taeniolabidoidea). Monobaatar mimicus gen. n., sp. n., (assigned to the family incertae sedis) and Arginbaatar dimitrievae Trofimov (assigned to the Arginbaataridae in ?Plagiaulacoidea). For E. magnus and A. dimltrtevae upper and lower elements are matched, E. minor is based on lower teeth, M. mimicus on upper teeth. Both the Eobaataridae and Arginbaataridae have five upper and three lower premolars. Eobaataridae has lower incisor with limited enamel band and P, parallel-sided with single basal cusp; it is in some respects intermediate between the Plagiaulacidae and Late Cretaceous Taeniolabidoidea. Arginbaataridae has lower incisor completely covered with enamel. It is highly specialized in the structure of P,, which is only partly covered with enamel and rotated during ontogeny; on the other hand, it retains primitive features: upper canine and double infraorbital foramen. Both the Eobaataridae and Arginbaataridae have gigantoprismatic enamel. If gigantoprismatic enamel made its appearance only once in multituberculate evlution, one should expect that both families share a common ancestor, which would be a plagiaulacid. Some Late Juramic and Early Cretaceous British and Late Jurassic North American multitubercuLates are figured for comparison. It is demonstrated that Ctenacodon has two infraorbital foramina. The systematic position of some Bolodon species is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The fossil turtle Kayentachelys aprix is known from Early Jurassic sediments of the Kayenta Formation, Arizona, USA. The detailed description of this taxon’s cranium offered in this paper demonstrates that this turtle presents a mixture of primitive and derived character states. Among others, the presence of an interpterygoid vacuity, a basipterygoid process, a prootic that is exposed in ventral view, and a foramen posterius canalis carotici interni that is formed entirely by the basisphenoid are generally considered primitive for turtles. On the other hand, the presence of an undivided apertura narium, a well developed cavum tympani, an incipient cavum postoticum, and an unpaired vomer are considered to be de− rived. Kayentachelys aprix has previously been hypothesized to be the oldest stem cryptodiran turtle because of the pres− ence of a flat, vertical plate on the processus pterygoideus externus, and the presence of a processus trochlearis oticum. However, the presence of these characters cannot be confirmed in the available specimens. Other putative stem− cryptodiran characters, such as the prefrontal−vomer contact and the presence of an epipterygoid, are herein corroborated as being symplesiomorphies, because they generally appear to be present in basal turtles.",

P. perotorum shares characters with each of the previously known species that are not present in the other, including very large nasal and supraorbital bosses that are nearly in contact and separated only by a narrow groove as in P. canadensis, and a rostral comb formed by the nasals and premaxillae as in P. lakustai. P. perotorum is the youngest centrosaurine known (70–69 Ma), and the locality that produced the taxon, the Kikak-Tegoseak Quarry, is close to the highest latitude for recovery of ceratopsid remains.",

About 3,000 specimens have been collected and 55 species and 5 subspecies of 36 genera described. A new family, Kielcephyllidae, two new subfamilies, Friedbergiinae and Guerichiphyllinae, 9 new genera, 36 new speoies and 5 subspecies have been erected. On the basis of a lithological analysis of beds, faunal assemblages and the preservation state of corallites, it has been concluded that in the Lower Famennian a shallow sea existed at Kadzielnia. It was temporarily connected with the open sea. The corals are mostly preserved there in a life-time place. At Zareby, there was a lagoon with the remains of plants but with a normal salinity of water. In the Upper Famennian of Galezice, the sea water was well aerated and connected with the open sea. Fossils are broken but not worn off and, therefo,re, they were not transported. At Kowala, the sea was probably calm, not deep and well aerated. Index species for the Lower and Upper Famennian have been determined among the coral fauna examined. The age of individual zones has been determined by conodonts and where such were lacking, climeniids or trilobites. The history of the research of Famennian corals, which in general occur rarely and in monotonous assemblages, has been presented. To settle their generic assignment, the ontogeny of corals has been studied and the results were a basis for changes introduced to the classification. A few phyla have been distinguished and their phylogenetic relationships discussed.",

In this contribution, we augment the holotype of Neuquensaurus australis with a partial sacrum that was preserved in articulation with one of the caudal vertebrae from its original description, but not recognised as such at the time. We document this field association via the presence of a broken piece of matrix on the sixth sacral vertebral centrum that has a snap-fit to matrix on the rim of the anterior condyle of the holotypic biconvex vertebra.

The graptolites were prepared by dissolving the limestone and marly matrix in hydrochloric acid. For detailed study the specimens were bleached. The stratigraphic position and significance of the fauna investigated are discussed. The main trend in the evolution of sicula consists in its simplification and is interpreted as due to foetalization. In contrast with sicula, the evolution of thecae displays progressive changes which primarily consist in the development of apertural apparatus, connected, in most lines, with the elaboration of its secondary asymmetry. The biological significance of this pattern of evolution of thecal characters. is discussed. The Cucullograptinae supply convincing evidence for the distal introduction of phylogenetic novelties which makes up a prevailing mode of evolutionary changes of astogeny in this group of moriograptids. Problems, related to the mechanisms of evolution and organization of graptolite colonies are discussed. Using the data, now available, tentative phylogenetic relationships within the group are established. An attempt is made to show some implications of these data in the problem of origin of the Cucullograptinae.

    "abstract": "Rebbachisaurids are a group of basal diplodocimorph sauropods that diversified in Gondwana at the end of the Early Cretaceous and the beginning of the Late Cretaceous.It is a group of great palaeobiogeographical interest, for it clearly illustrates various processes of dispersal throughout Gondwana and to Laurasia prior to the breakup of Africa and South America.However, the relationships within the group are still under discussion owing to the scarcity of cranial material that would help clarify them.In the present paper we describe the new rebbachisaurid Lavocatisaurus agrioensis gen.et sp.nov.from the Aptian-Albian (Lower Cretaceous) of Neuquén (Argentina).Remains have been recovered belonging to an adult specimen (holotype) and two immature specimens (paratypes).Taken together, almost all the bones of the taxon are represented, including most of the cranium.Lavocatisaurus agrioensis gen.et sp.nov. is the first rebbachisaurid from Argentina with an almost complete cranium, making it possible to recognize differences with respect to other rebbachisaurids, such as the highly derived Nigersaurus .Among its most notable characters are the presences of a large preantorbital fenestra and maxillary teeth that are significantly larger than those of the dentary.Our phylogenetic study places Lavocatisaurus amongst basal rebbachisaurids, as the sister lineage to Khebbashia (the clade formed by Limaysaurinae + Rebbachisaurinae).This position, which is somewhat more derived than that previously suggested for Comahuesaurus and Zapalasaurus (the Argentinean rebbachisaurids closest in geographical and geological terms), reaffirms the presence of different basal rebbachisaurid lineages in the Early Cretaceous of Patagonia.",

On the base of the investigated material the author agrees with the opinions postulating that in Brachythoraci there has occured the disappearance ot dentine and its substitution by osseous tissue. In the brachythoracids this process had taken place at a considerably earlier evolutionary stage than in the Crossopterygii and the Dipnoi and it had moreover progressed farther, having affected the jaw denticles too. The structure of the parasphenoid in genus Pachyosteus, problems relating to the position of the gill slit, and changes in the outline of bones during ontogeny are discussed and some cursory remarks on the systematics of Brachythoraci are given. The final chapter contains notes on the stratigraphic distribution and geographical range of the described crachythoracid forms.",

Several skeletal elements of Trirachodon were examined in order to document histological changes during ontogeny, as well as histovariability in the skeleton. The bone histology of all the elements consists of a moderately vascularized, periodically interrupted, fibro−lamellar bone tissue. This suggests that the overall growth of Trirachodon was probably rapid during the favourable season, but decreased or ceased during the unfavourable season. As the environment is thought to have been semi−arid with seasonal rainfall, it is possible that Trirachodon was sensitive to such environmental fluctuations. Some inter−elemental histovariability was noted where the number and prominence of growth rings varied. Limb bone cross−sectional geometry revealed a relatively thick bone wall and sup− ports earlier proposals that Trirachodon was fossorial.",

In phosphatized specimens the outer wall is often peeled off, exposing the ornamented middle wall. Some phosphatized specimens isolated from the rock matrix and specimens seen in thin sections of phosphorites show a partly preserved outer wall with spines, which can be compared to the thin-sectioned specimens from the chert beds. The small pits usually seen on the surface of the ornamented middle wall of phosphatized specimens correspond to the attachment spots of the spines in the outer wall. The presence of a spiny outer wall is a characteristic of Tianzhushania Yin and Li, 1978. Tianzhushania ornata (Xiao and Knoll, 2000) comb. nov. is here proposed as the valid name for the species. The proposed resting-egg nature of T. ornata, mainly based on the ornament type of the middle wall, cannot be excluded. The presence of a spiny outer wall, however, suggests that it is a pelagic rather than a benthic form.",

Losses were more severe during the Givetian (including the extinction of the suborder Davidsoniidina, and the reduction of the suborder Lissatrypidina to a single genus), but origination rates in the remaining suborder surviving into the Frasnian kept the group alive, though much reduced in biodiversity from the late Early and Middle Devonian. In the terminal phases of the late Palmatolepis rhenana and P . linguiformis zones at the end of the Frasnian, during which the last few Atrypidae declined, no new genera originated, and thus the Atrypida were extirpated. There is no evidence for an abrupt termination of all lineages at the F-F boundary, nor that the Atrypida were abundant at this time, since all groups were in decline and impoverished. Atrypida were well established in dysaerobic, muddy substrate, reef lagoonal and off-reef deeper water settings in the late Givetian and Frasnian, alongside a range of brachiopod orders which sailed through the F-F boundary: tropical shelf anoxia or hypoxia seems implausible as a cause for atrypid extinction. Glacial-interglacial climate cycles recorded in South America for the Late Devonian, and their synchronous global cooling effect in low latitudes, as well as loss of the reef habitat and shelf area reduction, remain as the most likely combined scenarios for the mass extinction events.",

The difference in the shape of the parietal between the population from Krasiejow and the type population of Metoposaurus diagnosticus enables the dis− crimination of two separate subspecies within Metoposaurus diagnosticus. For the specimens from the Late Carnian of Drawno Beds at Krasiejow, Poland and its lateral equivalents Lehrberg Beds at Stuttgart−Sonnenberg and Kieselsandstein at Fichtenberg, Germany, a new chronosubspecies Metoposaurus diagnosticus krasiejowensis is erected. The new sub− species differs from the older nominal subspecies M. diagnosticus diagnosticus in having a shorter and wider prepineal part of the parietal. If one accepts that the nominal subspecies is the ancestor of M. krasiejowensis the change in the shape of the parietal would be a reversal of the trend towards elongating postorbital part of the skull observed in ancestors of the metoposaurids. It seems that the skull development in ontogeny changed after the anterior shift of the orbits occurred in the phylogenetic history of the metoposaurids.

The close resemblance in morphology to the Lower Cretaceous Dsungaripterus allows identification of the specimen as the first and oldest record of dsungaripterids in Central Europe. Fur− thermore, it is the oldest certain record of a dsungaripterid pterosaur world wide. The biomechanical characteristics of the dsungaripterid long bone construction shows that it has less resistance against bending and torsion than in non−dsungari− pteroid pterosaurs, but has greater strength against compression and local buckling. This supports former suggestions that dsungaripterids inhabited continental areas that required an active way of life including frequent take−off and landing phases.

The adult animal is small, with a well-ossified skull having a characteristic pattern of pustulate sculpture on the roofing bones and an expanded angular flange on the lower jaw. Skin impressions show a pattern of fine granular dorsal scales, rhomboidal ventral scales, and elongate tail scales arranged in annulae. In many features, the skull resembles that of the living Xenosaurus and Shinisaurus, as well as Carusia from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia and China. Phylogenetic analysis using three different data sets provides some support for that interpretation. The postcranial skeleton is characterised by long hind limbs and short forelimbs, but the delicacy of the long pes and the slender claws suggest this animal may have been a climber rather than a facultative bipedal runner.",

Recently reported vascular imprints (valleculae) on the endocranial sur− faces of the braincase suggest that nonavian maniraptoriform theropods had brains that tightly fit the endocranium. Similar impressions of the intracranial vascular system are reported here in two ornithischian clades, Hadrosauridae and Pachy− cephalosauridae. These structures are more widespread in dinosaurs than previously thought, and suggest that the brain closely fit the endocranium in some regions of the forebrain through hindbrain in several distantly related dinosaur groups.",

The fauna is dominated by internal moulds of various molluscs and tubular problematica, but also includes hyolith opercula, echinoderm ossicles, and other calcareous small shelly fossils preserved by phosphatisation. Originally organophosphatic shells are comparatively rare, but are represented by brachiopods, hyolithelminths, and tommotiids. The fauna is similar to other late Early Cambrian faunas from slope and outer shelf settings along the eastern margin of Laurentia and may be of middle Dyeran age. The similarity of these faunas indicates that at least by the late Early Cambrian, a distinctive and laterally continuous outer shelf fauna had evolved. The Forteau Formation also shares elements with faunas from other Early Cambrian provinces, strengthening ties between Laurentia and Australia, China, and Europe during the late Early Cambrian. Two new taxa of problematic fossil organisms are described, the conical Clavitella curvata gen. et sp. nov. and the wedge-shaped Sphenopteron boomerang gen. et sp. nov.",

Over 180 isolated theropod teeth re− covered from that formation were studied in order to document theropod diversity in the Madagascar insular setting. Tooth morphology and characteristics of the Maevarano teeth were compared to those of known theropod teeth for identi− fication, including the Malagasy non−avian theropods Majungatholus atopus and Masiakasaurus knopfleri. Tooth and denticle morphologies permit the recognition of five tooth morphotypes: three morphotypes are referable to Majunga− tholus atopus based on variation in tooth morphology observed in teeth preserved in situ in the jaws of two specimens, and one morphotype is ascribable to Masiakasaurus knopfleri. Teeth pertaining to the fifth morphotype differ from other morphotypes in the size and orientation of the denticles, shape and orientation of blood grooves, and in general tooth mor− phology. Statistical analyses reveal that the fifth Maevarano tooth morphotype is similar to dromaeosaurid teeth, suggest− ing that a yet unknown theropod taxon inhabited Madagascar during the latest Cretaceous. This morphotype represents the first evidence of the possible presence of a dromaeosaurid in Madagascar and supports the theory that dromaeosaurids were present throughout Pangaea before the break−up of the supercontinent during the Late Jurassic and had colonized Madagascar before its separation from Africa during the Early Cretaceous.",

    "abstract": "The first unambiguous evidence of the presence of osteoderms in sauropod dinosaurs came from the discovery of Saltasaurus loricatus, a titanosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of Argentina.The dermal armor of Saltasaurus is composed of bony plates and small dermal ossicles.Here, we analyze the bone microstructure of these elements and provide information regarding its origin and development.The bony plates are composed almost entirely of reconstructed cancellous bone.Remains of primary bone consist of coarse bundles of mineralized collagenous fibers towards the external surface.Also, woven fibered bone tissue appears in the basal and lateral regions.Dermal ossicles lack secondary remodeling, and their matrix is formed by three orthogonal systems of collagenous fiber bundles.Growth lines are present in both bony plates and ossicles.Bone histology reveals that osteoderms mainly originated through direct mineralization (metaplasia) of the dermis, although other mechanisms are also involved (at least in the origin of dermal plates).The common features of development and integumental location of the osteoderms of Saltasaurus and other non-related vertebrates (e.g., lepidosaurs, crocodylomorphs) are linked to the intrinsic skeletogenic properties of the dermis.",

Large collections of paterinates from the lower Cambrian Wilkawillina, Ajax, and Wirrapowie limestones in the Arrowie Basin, South Australia have prompted redescription of the type species Askepasma toddense and the erection of a new species, Askepasma saproconcha sp. nov.

Askepasma toddense predominantly occurs in Abadiella huoi Zone equivalent strata (Unnamed Cambrian Series 2, Stage 3, middle-upper Atdabanian) in the upper part of the lower Wilkawillina, Wirrapowie, and Ajax limestones. The shell microstructure of Askepasma suggests a proximal stem group position within the Brachiopoda and similarities with tommotiid taxa provides further evidence that the ancestry of crown group brachiopods is firmly entrenched within the Tommotiida.",

    "abstract": "A description is given of the structure and evolution of Upper Silurian Linograptinae on the base of material etched by chemical treatment of core samples from deep-boring at Mielnik on Bug (eastern Poland) and from Baltic erratic boulders. Neodivers ograptus n. gen., represented by N. nilssoni and N. beklemishevi n. sp., belongs to an earlier evolutionary phase of this subfamily . Their rhabdosornes are characterized by bipolar growth of thecae, for a sicular cladium is produced in addition to the primary branch (procladium). Linograptus posthumus with multiramous rhabdosomes, comprising several sicular cladia, most probably descends from such forms. The origin and phylogenetic relations within the Linograptinae are discussed. The bipolar rhabdosomes of Diversograptus and Neodiversograptus n. gen. in which two branches develop from the sicula in result of normal astogeny, are distinguished from bipolar morphoses here described in Lobograptus scanicus parascanicus and Linograptus posthumus which are produced in result of regeneration of monograptid colonies that had been broken off. These rhabdosomes are deprived of the sicula at the point of divergence of two thecal series. There generative forms differ fundamentally in their biological significance from bipolar forms, produced through normal astogeny, and obviously they cannot be taxonomically ranked. An attempt is made to define the morphological laws that govern the processes of normal astogeny, of the regeneration of colonies and of the simultaneous growth of thecae on the various branches of one colony. Using the data now available on the astogeny and evolution of the Monograptidae, a tentative classification is given of the phylogenetic modifications of astogeny by distinguishing their successive stages. Several new terms and definitions are introduced relevant to details of structure and development of multiramous monograptids.",

    "abstract": "In some extant ectotherms, the third eye (or pineal eye) is a photosensitive organ located in the parietal foramen on the midline of the skull roof.The pineal eye sends information regarding exposure to sunlight to the pineal complex, a region of the brain devoted to the regulation of body temperature, reproductive synchrony, and biological rhythms.The parietal foramen is absent in mammals but present in most of the closest extinct relatives of mammals, the Therapsida.A broad ranging survey of the occurrence and size of the parietal foramen in different South African therapsid taxa demonstrates that through time the parietal foramen tends, in a convergent manner, to become smaller and is absent more frequently in eutherocephalians (Akidnognathiidae, Whaitsiidae, and Baurioidea) and non-mammaliaform eucynodonts.Among the latter, the Probainognathia, the lineage leading to mammaliaforms, are the only one to achieve the complete loss of the parietal foramen.These results suggest a gradual and convergent loss of the photoreceptive function of the pineal organ and degeneration of the third eye.Given the role of the pineal organ to achieve fine-tuned thermoregulation in ectotherms (i.e., \"cold-blooded\" vertebrates), the gradual loss of the parietal foramen through time in the Karoo stratigraphic succession may be correlated with the transition from a mesothermic metabolism to a high metabolic rate (endothermy) in mammalian ancestry.The appearance in the eye of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells replacing the photoreceptive role of the pineal eye could also have accompanied its loss.",

    "abstract": "The holotype specimen of the Late Triassic dinosauriform Caseosaurus crosbyensis is redescribed and evaluated phylogenetically for the first time, providing new anatomical information and data on the earliest dinosaurs and their evolution within the dinosauromorph lineage.Historically, Caseosaurus crosbyensis has been considered to represent an early saurischian dinosaur, and often a herrerasaur.More recent work on Triassic dinosaurs has cast doubt over its supposed dinosaurian affinities and uncertainty about particular features in the holotype and only known specimen has led to the species being regarded as a dinosauriform of indeterminate position.Here, we present a new diagnosis for Caseosaurus crosbyensis and refer additional material to the taxon-a partial right ilium from Snyder Quarry.Our comparisons and phylogenetic analyses suggest that Caseosaurus crosbyensis belongs in a clade with herrerasaurs and that this clade is the sister taxon of Dinosauria, rather than positioned within it.This result, along with other recent analyses of early dinosaurs, pulls apart what remains of the \"traditional\" group of dinosaurs collectively termed saurischians into a polyphyletic assemblage and implies that Dinosauria should be regarded as composed exclusively of Ornithoscelida (Ornithischia + Theropoda) and Sauropodomorpha.In addition, our analysis recovers the enigmatic European taxon Saltopus elginensis among herrerasaurs for the first time.This result suggests a greater body-size range for herrerasaurs than previously thought and provides further evidence for their presence in Europe during the Late Triassic.If this hypothesis is correct then this clade of herrerasaurs also represents the first clade of non-dinosaurian dinosauromorphs known to contain large-bodied carnivorous species.The results of our analyses also highlight the distinction between the clades Herrerasauridae and Herrerasauria, as they are currently defined, and necessitate a provisional revival of the latter until future works can better resolve the relationships among these important early taxa.",

    "abstract": "The pineal eye is a photoreceptive organ, sometimes called the “third eye”, housed within the parietal foramen of some ectothermic vertebrates (Eakin 1973; Quay 1979). It is amongst the most enigmatic organs, and accordingly, concerns relating to its origin and evolution have long fascinated palaeontologists (Eakin 1973; Roth and Roth 1980; Benoit et al. 2016). In dicynodont synapsids, a parietal foramen is almost always present, with a few noticeable exceptions that have, so far, eluded explanations (Benoit et al. 2016; Kammerer 2019). Kombuisia frerensis is one such exception. There are two recognised species of Kombuisia: K. frerensis, from South Africa, and K. antarctica, from Antarctica. The two species are virtually undistinguishable except for the absence of a parietal foramen in the former, whereas the latter retains a slit-like opening on the skull roof (Fröbisch et al. 2010). While describing K. frerensis, Hotton (1974) refrained from including the absence of a parietal foramen in the diagnosis of the species as very little was known about the intraspecific variability of this character. Intraspecific variation of the parietal foramen has since been documented in modern reptiles (e.g., Gundy and Wurst 1976; Roth and Roth 1980) and other synapsids (Benoit et al. 2016). As a result, the absence of a parietal foramen in K. frerensis has been treated with caution by subsequent authors (e.g., Kammerer 2019). In 2023, our research team found a new specimen referrable to K. frerensis: an almost undeformed skull with articulated lower jaw and associated postcrania (Fig. 1A). This new specimen confirms that the absence of a parietal foramen is diagnostic for K. frerensis. We here explore the physiological implications of this condition and propose that it may be the result of latitudinal gradient separating the two species of Kombuisia.",

Grasping spines of protoconodonts were originally built mainly of an organic substance. Their original composition was changed by secondary phosphatisation. The thickest layer of the protoconodont spines was originally constructed of organic fibrils, similar to those in the corresponding layer of chaetognaths. Recent molecu− lar investigations show that the chaetognath lineage separated in the early stage of metazoan radiation, which fits the pre− sented hypothesis.

Each immigration event usually changes the population variability of a local species (character displacement). Only a few lineages show their phyletic evolution within the studied area. Attempts to distinguish conodont species on the basis of platform element shape failed in some of the latest Frasnian palmatolepidids. Even at the apparatus−based generic level, certain ramiform elements of the apparatus appear much more diagnostic than the platforms. Correlative value of the late Frasnian palmatolepidids of unknown apparatus structure is thus questionable. The evolution of platform elements in Ancyrodella offers a more solid basis for age determination although their great population variability makes resolution rather low and requires the population approach.

Examination of Mesozoic lingulides has shown that they significantly differ from their Recent relatives Lingula and Glottidia in having longer lophophoral cavities, shorter ventral canals, better developed posterior adductor muscles, and less acute umbones. Morphological characters of the shell interior are needed to identify members of the Lingulidae, not solely external shell characteristics. The apparent evolutionary tendency towards a reduction of the volume of the lophophoral cavity contradics the traditional view that the 'living fossil' Lingula has survived without significant morphological change since the Paleozoic. Actually the today living lingulide genera probably arose in the early Cenozoic. A new inarticulate brachiopod genus, Lingularia is introduced, with three new species, Middle Triassic L.. siberica, Middle Jurassic L. sirnilis, and Cretaceous L. smirnovae .",

    "abstract": "Small shelly fossils are common in sediments of Early Cambrian age and include the earliest common representatives of metazoan animals with mineralized hard parts. The group includes fossils of very different morphology, composition and ultrastructure. They seem to represent skeletal remains of numerous animal groups, the biological affinities of which are largely unresolved. However, the wide geographic range of many forms has the potential to enhance biostratigraphic and palaeogeographic resolution in the Early Cambrian. The late Early Cambrian sequence of North-East Greenland has yielded an assemblage of more than 88 species of small shelly fossils, brachiopods and trilobites, indicative of a middle Dyeran age (Botoman equivalent). The recovered fossils include a number of species that are known from other Early Cambrian palaeocontinents, and particularly strong ties to late Early Cambrian faunas of Australia are documented. The many cosmopolitan taxa thus identified suggests a close juxtaposition of palaeocontinents at this time. The systematic affinity of many of these small shelly fossils is poorly understood, partly because of their fragmentary nature and poor preservation. However, new data from North-East Greenland improves our understanding of the function and biological affinity of certain taxa. Collections of the problematic fossil Mongolitubulus from North and North-East Greenland exhibit characters indicative of a defensive function as spines of bivalved arthropods, while species of the problematic genus Triplicatella represent the opercula of an unknown tubular shell, probably related to orthothecid hyoliths. The bivalved fossil Mickwitzia from North-East Greenland combines characters of linguliform brachiopods and sclerites of Micrina, a non-bivalved problematic form (halkieriid) from Australia. The combination suggests that Mickwitzia is a stem group brachiopod and strengthens arguments for a halkieriid ancestry of the brachiopod phylum.",

    "abstract": "The capybaras (Hydrochoeridae) are outstanding rodents for their large size and euhypsodont and multilaminated cheek teeth. Although today they are represented by a single species, it was generally thought that their past diversity was much higher, especially during the late Miocene–early Pliocene. Such diversity is here analyzed taking into account the ontogenetic variation of the p4–m3 in different populations. Numerous isolated teeth of different size found in the upper levels of the Puerto Madryn Formation (late Miocene, Peninsula Valdes, Argentina) were interpreted as members of an ontogenetic series of a new species here described, Cardiatherium patagonicum. They provided clues to evaluate onto− genetic variation and a new framework to analyze the family diversity. In this context, it is proposed that multiple species described from the Ituzaingo Formation (late Miocene, Entre Rios, Argentina) based on lower teeth, may actually repre− sent specimens of different stages of the ontogenetic trajectory of a single species. Likewise, we found that several nomi− nal taxa from other localities were based on juvenile specimens. According to these results, the diversity of the Hydrochoeridae during the late Miocene and early Pliocene was drastically reduced. The validity of the subfamily Cardiatheriinae is debated. Finally, it is suggested that the whole family should be revised taking into account the ontogenetic variation.",

Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 50 (3): 523–544. Collecting over the last twenty years in sand and gravel quarries near Yulafli in European Turkey has yielded a substantial fauna of large mammals. The most significant of these for biochronology are well−preserved remains of the ursid Indarctos arctoides, the suid Hippopotamodon antiquus, and several rhino genera. They point to a late Vallesian (MN 10−equivalent) age. Several other taxa, of longer chronological range, are in good agreement with this dating. The Proboscidea include, besides the Eastern Mediterranean Choerolophodon, the Deinotherium + Tetralophodon associa− tion, commonly found in Europe, and the rare “Mastodon” grandincisivus, here reported for the first time in the Vallesian. The age of Yulafli shows that the large size of some taxa, such as Deinotherium (size close to that of D. gigantissimum) and Dorcatherium, does not always track chronology. The Yulafli fauna is close in composition and ecology to other lo− calities in Turkish Thrace, and also shares several taxa unknown in Anatolia, especially Dorcatherium, with the North−Western European Province. It reflects a forested/humid landscape that extended in Vallesian times along the Aegean coast of Turkey, perhaps as far South as Crete, quite distinct from the open environments recorded at the same pe− riod in Greek Macedonia and Anatolia, and probably more like the central European one. Together with the establishment of a Tethys–Paratethys marine connection, this “Eastern Aegean Province” likely acted as an ecological barrier that hin− dered East−West migrations of open−country large mammals, such as bovids or long−limbed giraffes, and might have con− tributed to the differentiation of Ouranopithecus and Ankarapithecus.",

    "abstract": "The limb posture in early mammals is a matter of controversy. Kielan-Jaworowska and Gambaryan presented arguments for a sprawling posture in multituberculates, based mainly on three characters of the hind limbs (deep pelvis, mediolateral diameter of the tibia larger than the craniocaudal, and position of MtV, which fits the peroneal groove on the calcaneus and is not aligned with the axis of tuber calcanei). Here we present two more arguments for sprawling hind limbs in early mammals. One is the presence of an os calcaris, supporting the probably venomous spur in hind legs of docodontans, multituberculates, eutriconodontans, and 'symmetrodontans', similar to those of extant monotremes. We argue that early mammals (except for boreosphenidans) had sprawling limb posture and venomous spur; acquisition of the parasagittal stance was apparently characteristic only of boreosphenidans, in which the spur has not been found. The second argument is based on taphonomic evidence from lacustrine conditions (e.g., Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota), in which the mammalian skeletons, except for boreosphenidans (Sinodelphys and Eomaia), have been preserved compressed dorso-ventrally, suggesting sprawling stance. In similar conditions of the Eocene Messel Biota the skeletons of boreosphenidan mammals (except for bats and pangolins) are preserved lying on flanks, suggesting parasagittal stance. Sereno argued that forelimbs in multituberculates were parasagittal, based on the stated presence of a ventrally facing glenoid, a mobile shoulder joint, and an elbow joint with enhanced flexion-extension capability. However, these characters are not unequivocally indicative of parasagittalism. We demonstrate that the structure of the distal end of the multituberculate humerus is condylar, with no tendency for developing a trochlea. We reconstruct multituberculates and other early mammals with sprawling stance in resting position as plantigrade.",

The spectrum of Pleistocene wave exposure recorded ranged from prevailing heavy surf generated by oceanic swell to no significant wave turbuience. The regional variation of reef types in the Caribbean area during late Pleistocene high sea level stands corresponds to the Recent pattern thus giving evidence for a basically similar distribution of wave energy (and consequently of wind force and directions) as can be observed today.",

The sicula of the genus Idiotubus and the formation of the first bud are described for the first time. The names of a discophorous sicula for the siculae of sessile gra'ptolites, and of a nematophorous sicula for the siculae of free graptolites are introduced. The comparison of early development stages of sessile graptolites with corresponding stages of Rhabdopleura compacta Hincks reveals many similarities. The conditions of reproduction of sessile graptolites are examined. In the nematophorous siculae, the presence of a diaphragm is established on the boundary between the prosicula and the nema. The nema, which in principle is a tube, may be secondarily filled with an organic substance. It is presumed that a cord of soft tissue which in the animal's life time filled the canal of nema, might be homolo.:. gous to the stolon, formed in Rhabdopleura on a contractile stalk of the oozooid. Floating organs of various types might be developed by nema and virgula. Such organs might also be formed at the proximal end of rhabdosome or all along the thecae. Critical remarks. on Lapworth's theory concerning the epiplanctonic mode of life of the graptolites with nematophorous siculae are presented. In the author's opinion, their mode of life was rather holoplanctonic. These graptolites probably lived mostly in the surface of the sea, i.e. in neuston layer.",

    "abstract": "Palaeontological events, documented by widespread beds or thin intervals of strata with either unusual (\"exotic\") or acmes of common faunal elements are a characteristic feature of Upper Cretaceous epicontinental shelf sediments in NW Europe.Their importance in stratigraphic calibration has early been recognized and these \"bioevents\" are widely used as correlation tools.Furthermore, it appears that there is a genetic link between sequence and event stratigraphy as most of the \"classic\" bioevents developed during specific intervals of a 3 rd -order depositional sequence.Early transgressive bioevents (ETBs) are subdivided into two subtypes, i.e., the lag and migration subtype.The lag subtype corresponds to the transgressive surface and develops in response to winnowing and relative enrichment of robust biogenic hardparts.Taphonomic alteration and time-averaging are important features.The migration subtype is related to the disappearance of physical or ecological barriers that triggered faunal migrations.Despite their onlapping character,most ETBs are quasi-isochronous, and their preservation potential is usually high.Thus, they are very useful stratigraphicmarkers.Maximum flooding bioevents (MFBs) represent autochthonous biogenic concentrations with relatively low shell densities.They are related to habitat stability and ecospace expansion, and develop by population blooms of taxa well adapted to the special maximum flooding conditions of thewide epicontinental shelf ofNWEurope (e.g., low food availability).CenomanianMFBs ofNWEurope are not time-averaged and may comprise stratigraphically more expanded intervals with gradational lower and upper boundaries.Their often wide palaeogeographic extent associated with very high chances of preservation results in an excellent inter-basinal correlation potential.Late highstand bioevents (LHBs) are local to regional shell concentrations deposited as a result of increasing winnowing of fines and reworking by storms, currents and waves during late highstands.LHBs usually consist of paucior even monospecific skeletal concentrations with a high degree of fragmentation.Simple shell beds related to a single (storm) event, and composite (multiple-event) shell beds are recognized.LHBs share some features of ETBs, but lack of time-averaging, are laterally restricted and have low preservation potential.Thus, their importance in interbasinal correlation is poor.The time scales of Cenomanian bioevents range through several orders ofmagnitude (hours-days in LHB storm event concentrations to ~100 kyr in MFBs).In terms of position within sequences, the three bioevent types correspond to shell concentrations recognized in Mesozoic-Cenozoic formations around the world.Shell beds with similar positions within cycles as well as comparable sedimentologic and taphonomic characteristics have also been described from high-frequency sequences and parasequences, suggesting that the formational processes of shell beds operate in base-level controlled sedimentary cycles of different hierarchies (i.e., 3 rd -up to 7 th -order).",

    "abstract": "The lifestyles of all pterosaurs are contentious, but those of the pterodactyloid clade Azhdarchidae are particularly debated.A 2008 review of the functional morphology of azhdarchid pterosaurs concluded that they were probably terrestrial foragers, as evidenced by their long limbs, generalised skull construction, the arthrological limitations of their cervical series, trackway data indicating terrestrial proficiency, a strong continental skew in the depositional context of their fossils, and several additional lines of corroborating evidence.This hypothesis was recently challenged on three counts: (i) azhdarchid fossils routinely occur in aquatic deposits; (ii) terrestrially-foraging pterosaurs were highly vulnerable to predation and (iii), aerial \"water trawling\", where the mandible is pulled though water to catch food in a distended throat pouch, is a more likely foraging strategy.Pelican-like jaw mechanics were suggested for azhdarchids because of the asymmetrical jaw joints in these pterosaurs, which permit lateral deflection of the mandibular rami during jaw extension.We evaluate these three claims and conclude that all are flawed.The frequent occurrence of azhdarchid fossils in aquatic sedimentary systems is not significant with regard to ecology or behaviour, since these provide the overwhelming mechanism for the preservation of all fossil terrestrial animals.Likely pterosaur takeoff abilities and the ubiquitous nature of modern, terrestrially-foraging birds indicate that predation risks on ground-foraging pterosaurs are probably overstated.The kinematics of pterosaur jaws are entirely different to those of pelicans, which are highly specialised compared to those of all other tetrapods, and there are no indications from azhdarchid jaw anatomy that azhdarchids indulged in pelican-like foraging behaviour.The estimated amount of jaw expansion present in azhdarchids was minimal compared to that of pelicans, even when the asymmetrical jaw joints of azhdarchids are taken into account.Moreover, the widespread occurrence of asymmetrical jaw joints in other reptiles demonstrates that they are not related to any specific feeding habits.We conclude that terrestrial foraging remains the most parsimonious habit for azhdarchid pterosaurs.",

Teeth from 27 species of sharks are described including the earliest records of Chlamydoselachus and Heptranchias howelli from Europe. The fauna collected at the Faxe quarry is rich in large species of shark including Sphenodus lundgreni and Cretalamna appendiculata and includes no fewer than four species of Hexanchiformes. The species collected yield an interesting insight into shark diversity in the Boreal Sea during the earliest Paleogene. The early Danian fauna recorded from the Cerithium Limestone represents an impoverished Maastrichtian fauna, whereas the fauna found in the slightly younger bryozoan limestone is representative of a pronounced cold water fauna. Several species that hitherto have only been known from the Late Cretaceous have been identified, clearly indicating that the K-T boundary was not the end of the Cretaceous fauna; it lingered and survived into the early Danian.",

    "abstract": "Cardabiodon ricki and Cardabiodon venator were large lamniform sharks with a patchy but global distribution in the Cenomanian and Turonian.Their teeth are generally rare and skeletal elements are less common.The centra of Cardabiodon ricki can be distinguished from those of other lamniforms by their unique combination of characteristics: medium length, round articulating outline with a very thick corpus calcareum, a corpus calcareum with a laterally flat rim, robust radial lamellae, thick radial lamellae that occur in low density, concentric lamellae absent, small circular or subovate pores concentrated next to each corpus calcareum, and papillose circular ridges on the surface of the corpus calcareum.The large diameter and robustness of the centra of two examined specimens suggest that Cardabiodon was large, had a rigid vertebral column, and was a fast swimmer.The sectioned corpora calcarea show both individuals deposited 13 bands (assumed to represent annual increments) after the birth ring.The identification of the birth ring is supported in the holotype of Cardabiodon ricki as the back-calculated tooth size at age 0 is nearly equal to the size of the smallest known isolated tooth of this species.The birth ring size (5-6.6 mm radial distance [RD]) overlaps with that of Archaeolamna kopingensis (5.4 mm RD) and the range of variation of Cretoxyrhina mantelli (6-11.6 mm RD) from the Smoky Hill Chalk, Niobrara Formation.The revised, reconstructed lower jaw dentition of the holotype of Cardabiodon ricki contains four anterior and 12 lateroposterior files.Total body length is estimated at 5.5 m based on 746 mm lower jaw bite circumference reconstructed from associated teeth of the holotype.",

    "abstract": "Body mass estimations for extinct taxa are fundamental in palaeobiological reconstructions, but little work has been done on this topic for non-mammaliaform cynodonts (NMC), the diverse and abundant Permo-Cretaceous forerunners of mammals.Here, we estimated the body mass of five species of NMC cynognathians by linear measurements and circumferences of postcranial elements (humeri and femora) from 14 specimens from Triassic units of the Ischigualasto-Villa Union Basin located between San Juan and La Rioja provinces, and the Cuyo and San Rafael basins, both in Mendoza province, Argentina.For this purpose, we used predictive formulas available in the literature based on variables on appendicular skeleton of different extant groups of mammals and reptiles.Geometric similarity using skull length was applied to provide an estimation of adult masses for species with only samples of juvenile and subadult limb bones.A broad body mass range was recorded.Small traversodontids such as Andescynodon mendozensis and Pascualgnathus polanskii were between 1 to 3.5 kg.Medium-sized traversodontids include adult Massetognathus pascuali with masses from 20 to 40 kg, and the adult forms of large-sized cynognathians like Cynognathus crateronotus and Exaeretodon argentinus reached or surpassed 100 kg.The morphological variations in the skull and the different body sizes observed between traversodontids are interpreted as reflecting different types of diets where small-sized traversodontids had a generalist diet, and the medium/large-sized traversodontids were herbivorous.Finally, palaeoecological working hypotheses regarding cranial and dental morphology, body mass, and their possible relation with diet in non-mammaliaform cynodonts of South America are offered.",

Rhombically arranged elements, about 30 x 60 p, are interpreted as representing imbricating platelets, the distal ends of which projected as spinules from the body surface. Comparisons with other chancelloriids suggest that the flexible integument was continuous with the aragonitic sclerites that sit on the surface like cactus spines, and that both were formed by an epidermal epithelium secreting a continuous exoand endocuticle. In the sclerites, the exocuticle was mineralized; the unrnineralized endocuticle and cellular extensions from the epithelium filled the interior of the sclerites. In the flexible integument the epithelium was overlain by endocuticle and unmineralized exocuticle. This structure of soft integument and sclerites is at variance with proposals of poriferan or ascidian affinity of chancelloriids but in accord with a coeloscleritophoran model.",

    "abstract": "The Late Cretaceous belemnite family Belemnitellidae Pavlow, I9I4, which includes nine genera and two subgenera, occurs only in the Northern Hemisphere, that is in the North European and North American palaeobiogeographical Provinces of the North Temperate Realm, in addition to the northern margin of the Tethyan Realm in Europe. The North European Province is subdivided into the Central European, Central Russian and Baltoscandian Subprovinces. The centre of origin and dispersal of the belemnitellids lay in the North European Province and all known genera and subgenera occur there. The belemnitellids immigrated intermittently into the Tethyan Realm (at least nine times) and the North Amencan Province (at least six times). The majority of the species occurring in the Tethyan Realm are conspecific with those from the North European Province, whereas the species occurring in the North American Province are endemic, with a few exceptions. The endemic species probably evolved by allopatric speciation from initial migrants. More than a score migrations have been recognized within the subprovinces of the North European Province. The palaeogeographical distnbution and migration patterns of the belemnitellids were to a certain extent controlled by eustatic sea-level changes, cool or warm climatic phases and competition, although the cause of several migration events cannot be satisfactorily explained at present.",

The conodont faunas of these two consecutive conodont biozones have been investigated in 14 sections from south, south-central and central Sweden, the faunal differences between the areas being mainly expressed in shifts in relative abundance. The taxon which is generally the most abundant, Baltoniodus, has comparable abundance maxima at localities representing shallow parts of the basin as well as in deeper parts, indicating that some environmental factor other than water depth has influenced its distribution. Drepanodus and Protopanderodus rectus prefer areas representing deeper parts of the epicontinental sea. Scalpellodus is most abundant at the sites representing intermediate depths. Semiacontiodus cornuformis was adapted to shallow water and is lacking at levels representing maximum depths, but at some places (for instance in Skane) it is replaced by Semiacontiodus davidi.

Megatherium americanum (late Pleistocene of South America) has traditionally been re- garded a herbivore, but its dietary habits have not been considered in terms of a morpho- functional analysis. This study describes and analyses the morphology of the masticatory apparatus in order to interpret the jaw mechanics of M. americanum, and thus to infer its diet and behaviour. The results are compared with those for the mylodontid Glosso- therium robustum and the extant sloth Bradypus variegatus. The areas of origin and in- sertion of the masticatory musculature were reconstructed, and the moment arms gener- ated by this musculature were estimated so that the mechanics of the feeding apparatus might be described. These analyses indicate that M. americanum was well adapted for strong and mainly vertical biting. The teeth are extremely hypsodont and bilophodont, and the sagittal section. of each loph is triangular with a sharp edge. This suggests that the teeth were used mainly for cutting, rather than grinding, and that hard and fibrous food was not the main dietary component. The diet of M. americanum merits more rigorous analysis, but the evidence provided here indicates that it probably had a browsing diet in open habitats, but also could have fed on moderate to soft tough food.

This specimen is one of only a very few Cretaceous mammals known from Gondwana in general and Africa in particular. The specimen consists of a short, deep left dentary that bore a large, procumbent central incisor, and five single−rooted, hypsodont cheek−teeth. The specimen is very tentatively identified as a sudamericid, and thus may represent the first Afri− can record of an enigmatic clade of mammals, the Gondwanatheria, which is otherwise known from the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene of several other Gondwanan landmasses. Unfortunately, the precise age of the specimen could not be de− termined. If it is pre−Campanian and if its identity as a sudamercid is corroborated through subsequent discoveries, it rep− resents the earliest known gondwanatherian. If the specimen is from the Campanian or Maastrichtian, and again assuming its identification is correct, it has the potential to refute a recently formulated biogeographic hypothesis predicting the ab− sence of certain terrestrial and freshwater vertebrate taxa, including gondwanatherians, in Africa (i.e., those that evolved elsewhere on Gondwana after Africa became an isolated landmass).",

The Palmatolepis semichatovae transgression, followed by the transgressive/hypoxic Lower Kellwasser (KW) Event during the Palmatolepis rhenana Zone did not have catastrophic effects for atrypid faunas, but were rather associated with the appearance of a new species group comprising Iowatrypa, Waiotrypa, Costatrypa, Spinatrypina , Desquamatia and Radiatrypa. Stepdown demise of the biota started during the inter-KW regression, and culminated as a result of increasing stress during the Upper Kellwasser Event in the late Palmatolepis linguiformis Zone, mainly due to catastrophic sea level changes and anoxia, possibly linked to oceanic thermal changes (cooling) and nutrification pulses. The extinction pattern was diachronous and facies-controlled in this area, and the last atrypid survivors reached the Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) boundary. Increasing expansion from the adjacent deeper-water environment of the more resistant assemblages, with productids, cyrtospiriferids, athyridids and schizophoriids, occurred in the final crisis interval. This brachiopod fauna profusion characterized the earliest Famennian survival and early recovery phases of the mass extinction in this part of the Laurussian shelf, as well as the continuity of the deeper-water rhynchonellid-inarticulate biofacies across the F-F boundary. Spinatrypina (Exatrypa) relicta sp. n. is proposed as new.",

The general morphology of the skull is analysed using a morphometric procedure, the Resistant Fit Theta Rho Analysis, which allows comparison among different biological forms. Here, a large terminal form, the late Pleistocene genus Glyptodon, is compared with the smaller primitive Miocene genus Propalaehoplophorus, and with the generalised Recent armadillo Chaetophractus. The masticatory musculature of glyptodonts is reconstructed. Their tooth form and wear facets, as well as their mandibular symphysis and jaw joint, are analysed. A model of jaw movement is constructed based on these analyses. It is demonstrated that the masticatory apparatus of glyptodonts had undergone a telescoping process, which was already underway in the most ancient forms whose skull is known. This process created problems in regard to the way stresses produced by mastication were absorbed by the mandible, and therefore it might be regarded as non-adaptive. Some functional explanatory hypotheses are discussed, such as a requirement of keeping the moment of the weight of the cranium small enough to be counterbalanced by the neck muscles, or fitting the head into the armour.",

Guchinodon Trofimov, 1978 is regarded a junior subjective synonym of Gobiconodon Trofimov, 1978. Heavier wear of the molariforms M3 and M4 than of the more anterior one M2 in Gobiconodon borissiaki gives indirect evidence for molariform replacement in this taxon. The interlocking mechanism between lower molariforms in Gobiconodon is of the pattern seen in Kuehneotherium and Tinodon. The interlocking mechanism and the type of occlusion ally Amphilestidae with Kuehneotheriidae, from which they differ in having lower molariforms with main cusps aligned and the dentary-squamosal jaw joint (double jaw joint in Kuehneotheriidae). The main cusps in upper molariforms M3-M5 of Gobiconodon, however, show incipient triangular arrangement. The paper gives some support to Mills' idea on the therian affinities of the Amphilestidae, although it cannot be excluded that the characters that unite the two groups developed in parallel. Because of scanty material and ambiguity, we assign the Amphilestidae to order incertae sedis.",

Anoualerpeton differs from the exclusively Laurasian albanerpetontid genera Albanerpeton (Early Cretaceous– Paleocene, North America; Miocene, Europe) and Celtedens (?Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, Europe) in a unique combination of primitive and derived character states of the jaws and azygous frontals. Monophyly of Anoualerpeton is supported by two synapomorphies of the maxilla and dentary (occlusal margin convex in labial outline and teeth strongly heterodont in size anteriorly) that are convergent with an unrelated, relatively derived Late Cretaceous species of Albanerpeton from North America. The two species of Anoualerpeton differ in character states of the premaxilla and azygous frontals. Cladistic analysis of 20 characters scored for ten albanerpetontid taxa postulates Anoualerpeton as the sister−taxon of Albanerpeton + Celtedens. The sister−pair of Albanerpeton + Celtedens is founded on one or, perhaps, two premaxillary synapomorphies. Anoualerpeton unicus documents the only known Gondwanan occurrence for the Albanerpetontidae and provides a minimum age of basal Cretaceous for the establishment of the clade in Africa. Charac− ters of the mandible, vertebrae, and limbs support the interpretation that Ramonellus (Aptian; Israel) is a caudate, not an albanerpetontid.",

A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that much of the variance in tooth shape was a result of isometry, but some gross morphological variables exhibited strong positive allometry. Non−size associated fac− tors were also important in determining tooth shape, particularly when data on denticle dimensions were considered in the analysis. While PCA identified important factors in variation, PCA ordination plots did not cluster the teeth into distinct, separate groupings based on taxon or bone of origin.

Its metameric dorsal myomeres were separated by straight myosepta. The notochord was located ventrad of the muscular blocks instead of being bordered by them. The pharynx did not contain any filtratory basket but had only seven pairs of branchial arches. These were composed of rows of minute scleritic segments that connected the notochord with a rigid ventral trough. The head region was rather complex in organization and bore a specialized ring-like mouth apparatus. The presence of sensory organs, perhaps large eyes with sclerotic rings, is probable. Only in the remarkable elongation of the notochord and metameric arrangement of oval gonads this early chordate is similar to Branchiostoma. The anterior part of the muscular blocks of Yunnanozoon resembles a little the proboscis and collar of the enteropneusts and may perhaps be homologous with these structures, although in Yunnanozoon they are displaced much behind the mouth. The whole metameric muscular unit is proposed to correspond to the 'quilted pneu structure' of the Ediacaran problematic fossil Dickinonia. Monotypic Yunnanozoa classis n., Yunnanozoida ordo n., and Yunnanozoidae fam n. are proposed for this early chordate.",

The discovery of such a large and derived proboscidean with respect to Phosphatherium in the same African beds of such antiquity is evidence of an unexpected early diversity of proboscideans and of the old origin of the order.

The taxa newly recognized in the Pondaung Formation are two indeterminate bunodont artio− dactyls, two small “eomoropid” perissodactyls (Eomoropus sp. cf. E. minimus and an indeterminate “eomoropid”), and a new deperetellid perissodactyl genus, Bahinolophus, which is established for Deperetella birmanica from the Pondaung Formation. The Pondaung ungulate fauna consists of 29 species (14 families and 18 genera): one species of an indeterminate small ungulate, 12 species (six genera in six families) of artiodactyls, and 16 species (11 genera in seven families) of perissodactyls. Although both Pondaung artiodactyls and perissodactyls are abundant and taxonomi− cally diverse, the former are less diversified in generic numbers than the latter, but are nearly equal to the latter in abun− dance. Anthracotheriid artiodactyls and brontotheriid and amynodontid perissodactyls are the most abundant elements in the fauna. The estimated paleoecologies of the included taxa, the geologic and geographic evidence, and cenogram analysis suggest that the paleoenvironment of the Pondaung fauna was forested/woodland vegetation with humid/sub− humid moisture and large rivers, which were located not far from the eastern Tethyan Sea. The age of the Pondaung fauna is independently correlated with the latest middle Eocene only on the basis of the stratigraphic, microfossil, and radiometric evidence, yielding a result consistent with mammalian faunal correlations. On the other hand, the Pondaung fauna includes many artiodactyl taxa compared to other middle Eocene faunas of East Asia and shows rela− tively high endemism at the generic level, implying that the Pondaung fauna is not formally included in the Eocene Asian Land Mammal “Ages” system.",

The results of the cladistic analysis show that the European spe− cies possess characters that can be considered as slightly derived if compared to those of its American relative, suggesting an eastward dispersion from North America before the Paleocene–Eocene boundary and before the full opening of the At− lantic Ocean or local evolution from a basal gavialoid stock similar to E. minor. Both species of Eosuchus come from ma− rine outcrops and represent a further evidence for the salt−water tolerance of the earliest stages of Gavialoidea evolution− ary history. Despite the present endemicity of the only living gharial, Gavialis gangeticus, the historical biogeography of gavialoids shows a lost global distribution and reveals several transoceanic dispersals.",

Two new families of acanthodians are erected, based primarily on histological structure of scales: the Vesperaliidae (stranggewebe extending throughout the scale crown) and the Acritolepidae (bone-like mesodentine in the scale crown). The latter family includes species erected for articulated fish. The families Tchunacanthidae and Lenacanthidae are united in the single family Tchunacanthidae, characterized by having scale crowns with mesodentine formed mainly by unipolar cells. A sixth group, which we exclude from the Nostolepis -type, has scale crowns composed of dentine without lacunae, plus durodentine, and bases with only rare osteocyte cavities. The new groups promote the revision and reassignment of many nostolepid taxa, in particular removing many species from the genus Nostolepis. Four new genera are erected: Pechoralepis (including part of Nostolepis), assigned to Acritolepidae nov.; and three genera assigned to an indeterminate family, which scales are composed of only odontocytic mesodentine without stranggewebe: Nostovicina (including part of Nostolepis), Nobilesquama (including part of Nostolepis), and Peregrinosquama (including part of Watsonacanthus). Histological structures are considered the primary characters of taxonomical value when based on isolated scales. Unfortunately, scale histology is unknown for most articulated acanthodians.",

The specimen consists of a fragmentary right lower jaw with first incisor and five preserved postcanine teeth (interpreted as p5–m4). Symmetrolestes has acute−angled molariforms with complete shearing surfaces on the para− and protocristids, and relatively tall crowns, features that are referable to Spalacotheriidae. Symmetrolestes is more derived than zhanghe− otheriids in having complete shearing surfaces, taller crowns, and more complete cingulids. It differs from other spalacotheriids in having fewer molariforms (m1–4), higher number of premolariforms (p1–5), and gradual transition be− tween premolariforms and molariforms. Our cladistic analysis of 29 characters shows Symmetrolestes as the sister group of the remaining Spalacotheriidae. This node is supported by only one character (Bremer support: 1) and therefore not particularly stable. The remaining spalacotheriids are arranged in a fully pectinated tree conforming to the topology of the previous researchers, in which Spalacolestinae occupy an apical position. The combination of the occurrences of a primi− tive spalacotheriid, Symmetrolestes, in Japan and of Zhangheotheriidae, which is the sister taxon of Spalacotheriidae, in China suggests a possibility for an East Asian origin of Spalacotheriidae, although it implies long ghost lineages for the latest Jurassic to Early Cretaceous East Asian “symmetrodonts”.",

New observation reveals that the ventral trunk bears an additional set of ventral sclerites while the lateral sclerites display a tubercle−bearing (inner surface) and net−like (outer surface) microstructure similar to that of Tabelliscolex hexagonus. These findings mean that: (1) Cricocosmia shows a dorso−ventral and antero−posterior differentiation in trunk ornament; (2) as seen from the microstructure, Cricocosmia is close to Tabelliscolex hexagonus, supporting the idea that lobo− podians and arthropods, both of which show an upper capping layer in the outer sclerites, are more closely related than the palaeoscolecidans; and (3) the similarities among the scalids, pharyngeal teeth and the trunk spines of palaeoscolecidans are superficial. Tabelliscolex maanshanensis sp. nov., characterized by an inner concentric circlet of laminae in each tu− bercle of the lateral trunk plate, is proposed herein.

However, it differs from the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene Laurasian cimolodontans (including Ptilodontoidea) in having a long, straight posterior margin, a nearly straight dorsal margin, characteristic of some “Plagiaulacida”, and in having the lingual side close to the mirror image of the labial side, the character that poses difficulties in establishing whether it is a right or left tooth.

The deterioration of the climate towards the close of the Pliocene brought about a decfine in thermophilous forms. The faunas of the middle Pleistocene show a conlplete absence of thermophilous species, while the share of forest and boreal species increases. It has been shown that from the early Pliocene onwards, changes which appear to be evolutionary trends have continued to take place in skull structure. Some of these trends were analysed, and they were found to consist mainly in the reduction of the splanchnocranium: shortening of the palate and of the premolar toothrows (both in the maxilla and the mandible). Postdental part of the mandible becomes shorter.",

In overall osteology, Wieslochia most closely resembles extant Suboscines but these similarities may be plesiomorphic for Passeriformes. W. weissi differs from the stem species pattern hypothesized for Eupasseres in the mor− phology of the distal carpometacarpus, the absence of a hooked processus acrocoracoideus (coracoid), and the presence of furrows instead of certain canals on the hypotarsus, and may even be outside crown group Eupasseres, the clade including Oscines and Suboscines. Because the earliest European fossil record of oscine passerines is from the late Oligocene, pas− serines outside crown group Oscines may have colonized Europe before the arrival of Oscines from the Australian conti− nental plate.",

    "abstract": "Fossil utricular otoliths (= lapilli) from cypriniform fishes have long been recorded from European Oligocene and Neo− gene freshwater and oligohaline sediments. Until now, their determination was limited to the family level owing to the lack of morphological investigations on lapilli of Recent cypriniforms. The present study introduces a terminology for the lapillus morphology that is based on the lapilli of 134 specimens of 20 cyprinid and one balitorid species. It is demon− strated that the lapillus has valuable characters for taxonomic classification. As a result, fossil lapilli from Oligocene and Miocene continental deposits from the western Mediterranean, the Swiss and the South German Molasse Basin, the Mainz Basin, and additionally from Anatolia could be determined. Nine species were identified: aff. Abramis sp. vel aff. Alburnus sp., aff. Alburnoides sp., aff. Barbus sp., cf. Leuciscus sp., Palaeoleuciscus sp., Palaeotinca moeddeni sp. nov., Palaeotinca sp. 1, aff. Phoxinus sp., and aff. Rutilus sp. vel aff. Scardinius sp. Our study includes the oldest record of a Phoxinus−related and a Palaeotinca species from Europe. Additionally, aff. Abramis sp. vel aff. Alburnus sp. and aff. Alburnoides have been identified as fossils for the first time. The determination of the fossil lapilli has been supported by means of pharyngeal teeth, with the exception of aff. Abramis sp. vel aff. Alburnus sp., whose lapilli were found together with pharyngeal teeth of Palaeocarassius sp. It is suggested that these so−called Palaeocarassius pharyngeal teeth do not belong to an ancestor of the Carassius lineage, but to a forerunner of the Abramis or Alburnus lineage. Our results support the previously described turnover in the Paratethys freshwater fish fauna about 17–18 Ma ago, when Palaeotinca spp. be− came extinct and the first appearance of Palaeoleuciscus sp. and Palaeocarassius sp. (= aff. Abramis sp. vel aff. Alburnus sp.) occurred. The Oligocene and Miocene cypriniform fishes did not evolve any provincialism from southern France throughout the Molasse Basin to the Mainz Basin.",

    "abstract": "“Pediomyids” are a diverse group of small− to medium−sized marsupials which comprise a significant portion of many Late Cretaceous North American mammalian faunas. Known almost exclusively from isolated teeth and jaw fragments, “pediomyids” exhibit far more diversity than any other contemporaneous group of North American mammals. This has led some to suggest that the family “Pediomyidae” is an artificial, polyphyletic assemblage composed of multiple lin− eages that independently acquired various traditionally−recognized “pediomyid” molar characters, such as a reduction of the anterior stylar shelf, reduction of the stylocone and a labial shift in the attachment of the cristid obliqua. The present study seeks to elucidate the interrelationships of “pediomyid” marsupials and test the monophyly of the group using cladistic methodology, including a broad sampling of Late Cretaceous North American taxa and a comprehensive set of qualitative molar characters. Results suggest that the family “Pediomyidae” and the genus “Pediomys” are both poly− phyletic and are in need of systematic revision. Iqualadelphis lactea (Aquilan) appears to be unrelated to the “pediomyid” radiation, and rests as a stem taxon near the base of the cladogram. The large Aquilan Aquiladelphis nests in a trichotomy with a strictly−defined “Pediomyidae” and the enigmatic Lancian taxon Glasbius, suggesting the possibility of a distant relationship (above the familial level). Three clades are recognized within the “Pediomyidae”: a restricted Pediomys, Leptalestes gen. nov. (containing the three smallest species), and Protolambda (containing the remaining three larger spe− cies). Results suggest that “Pediomys” exiguus is a stem taxon lacking a close relationship to Pediomyidae sensu stricto, and is removed to permit recognition of the family as monophyletic. The results carry implications for the role “pediomyids” might have played in the initial North American marsupial radiation sometime prior to the Campanian, and the pattern of molar evolution throughout major Late Cretaceous lineages.",

    "abstract": "Current codes of biological nomenclature define taxon names using types and ranks: the type determines the mini− mal membership of a named taxon, and the rank is supposed to determine its limits.Homo is “the taxon including the type species Homo sapiens that is assigned to the rank of genus”. However, there is no “genus concept” (analogous to a spe− cies concept), and thus no way of empirically determining the limits of a particular genus, even in the context of a single agreed phylogeny. The same problems also apply to higher taxa at all other ranks under current codes, leading to great taxonomic instability. All proposed objective criteria for de− termining membership of taxa at a particular rank (e.g., geological age, genetic divergence) are shown to be problem− atic. In contrast, the clades named by phylogenetic defini− tions are objective and stable. Node−based and branch− based definitions are most precise; however, apomorphy− based definitions can be ambiguous due to difficulty in de− fining alternative character states, and optimisation uncer− tainty. A major benefit of ranks (information about relative nesting of taxa) can be achieved even more efficiently using standardised but rankless suffixes already widely used in phylogenetic taxonomy. Finally, in situations where the phy− logeny is poorly known, phylogenetic nomenclature appears to be superior to the Linnean system. Phylogenetic nomen− clature does not force one to officially name poorly corrobo− rated groupings, whereas Linnean codes compel users to erect and name genera even when relevant supraspecific re− lationships are poorly known.",

    "abstract": "The origin of tympanic hearing in early synapsids is still controversial, because little is known about their inner ear and the function of their sound conducting apparatus.Here I describe the earliest known tympanic ear in the synapsid lineage, the ear of Pristerodon (Therapsida, Anomodontia) from the Late Permian of South Africa, which was virtually reconstructed from neutron tomographic data.Although Pristerodon is not a direct ancestor of mammals, its inner ear with distinctive cochlear cavity represents a connecting link between the primitive therapsid inner ear and the mammalian inner ear.The anatomy of the sound conducting apparatus of Pristerodon and the increased sound pressure transformer ratio points to a sensitivity to airborne sound.Furthermore, the origins of the cochlea and impedance matching hearing in synapsids coincided with the loss of contact between head and substrate, which already took place at least in Late Permian therapsids even before the postdentary bones became detached from the mandible.",

    "abstract": "Adult stages of wall ontogeny of fossil and Recent scleractinians show that epitheca was the prevailing type of wall in Triassic and Jurassic corals. Since the Late Cretaceous the frequency of epithecal walls during adult stages has decreased. In the ontogeny of Recent epithecate corals, epitheca either persists from the protocorallite to the adult stage, or is replaced in post-initial stages by trabecular walls that are often accompanied by extra-calicular skeletal elements. The former condition means that the polyp initially lacks the edge zone, the latter condition means that the edge zone develops later in coral ontogeny. Five principal patterns in wall ontogeny of fossil and Recent Scleractinia are distinguished and provide the framework for discrimination of the four main stages (grades) of evolutionary development of the edge-zone. The trend of increasing the edge-zone and reduction of the epitheca is particularly well represented in the history of caryophylliine corals. We suggest that development of the edge-zone is an evolutionary response to changing environment, mainly to increasing bioerosion in the Mesozoic shallow-water environments.

Phosphate internal moulds, phosphate replaced originally carbonate shells, and phosphate coatings show lamello-fibrillar structure, prismatic structure, and regularly foliated structure. The lamello-fibrillar structure appears earlier in the fossil record than laminar structures such as nacreous or foliated structures. It has been identified in fossil mollusks, which occur in China as early as the lower phosphate layer of the Zhongyicun Member of the Meishucunian. Therefore, the lamello-fibrillar structure appears to be primitive in mollusks. The lamello-fibrillar and prismatic aragonite is the most common shell material of molluscan skeletons in the Early Cambrian Meishucunian and equivalents around the world. Although the early molluscan microstructure is not so diverse as that of extant mollusks, it may be of use in high rank taxonomic classification as shown by the early conchiferan mollusks discussed here. These mollusks are characterized by the horizontal fibrillae that are layered and parallel, and thereby differ from hyoliths, in which the horizontal fibrillae appear to be in the form of the bundles of fibres that can branch or anastomose.",

    "abstract": "Small shelly fossils are common in sediments of Early Cambrian age and include the earliest common representatives of metazoan animals with mineralized hard parts. The group includes fossils of very different morphology, composition and ultrastructure. They seem to represent skeletal remains of numerous animal groups, the biological affinities of which are largely unresolved. However, the wide geographic range of many forms has the potential to enhance biostratigraphic and palaeogeographic resolution in the Early Cambrian. The late Early Cambrian sequence of North-East Greenland has yielded an assemblage of more than 88 species of small shelly fossils, brachiopods and trilobites, indicative of a middle Dyeran age (Botoman equivalent). The recovered fossils include a number of species that are known from other Early Cambrian palaeocontinents, and particularly strong ties to late Early Cambrian faunas of Australia are documented. The many cosmopolitan taxa thus identified suggests a close juxtaposition of palaeocontinents at this time. The systematic affinity of many of these small shelly fossils is poorly understood, partly because of their fragmentary nature and poor preservation. However, new data from North-East Greenland improves our understanding of the function and biological affinity of certain taxa. Collections of the problematic fossil Mongolitubulus from North and North-East Greenland exhibit characters indicative of a defensive function as spines of bivalved arthropods, while species of the problematic genus Triplicatella represent the opercula of an unknown tubular shell, probably related to orthothecid hyoliths. The bivalved fossil Mickwitzia from North-East Greenland combines characters of linguliform brachiopods and sclerites of Micrina, a non-bivalved problematic form (halkieriid) from Australia. The combination suggests that Mickwitzia is a stem group brachiopod and strengthens arguments for a halkieriid ancestry of the brachiopod phylum.",

This is the earliest known eutherian skull (about 87 Ma) and the sixth genus of Cretaceous eutherians in which a skull is available. Because the skull of D. nessovi is sub-adult, certain plesiomorphic features may be ontogenetic and should be interpreted with caution. Four upper premolars and five lower premolariform teeth were in use (possibly to become four lowers when fully adult). The upper cheek-teeth have winged conules; M2 has large parastylar and small metastylar projections. Preand postcingula are lacking on DP4 and the upper molars. The talonids of dp4-m2 are about 90% as wide as the trigonids, with widely separated entoconid and hypoconulid. The skull has a large sphenorbital fissure, no foramen rotundum, and apparently no pterygoid process of the sphenoid. A large orbital wing of the palatine prevents maxilla-frontal contact within the orbit. The zygomatic arch is slender. The cochlea has one full turn, with an expanded apex, which suggests that a lagena might have been present. A large malleus with a robust anterior process, and a large promontorium may be due to young age of the individual or a primitive retention, as in the platypus. Because of the similarity to Asioryctidae m both cranial structure and dentition, we assign Daulestes tentatively to Asioryctitheria Novacek et al. 1997, family incertae sedis.",

    "abstract": "During the Middle and Late Cambrian in the area of the present-day Holy Cross Mountains all the traces of infaunal activity were produced by animals burrowjng parallel to and immediately below the sediment surface, deeper infaunal burrowers being missing. Deeper penetration was probably not possible due to anoxic conditions within the sediment. This was not the case in the Early Cambrian, where numerous deep vertical burrows with spreite structures are known in the area. Diversity of the Middle and Late Cambrian trace fossil assemblages of the Holy Cross Mts is low, with only six ichnogenera of non-arthropod traces in the Middle Cambrian and eight ichnogenera in the Late Cambrian, compared with 24 ichnogenera in the Early Cambrian. The most unusual is a large hemispherical burrow, possibly of actinian origin, for which the name Bergaueria elliptica isp. n. is proposed. Treptichnus rectangularis isp. n. represents horizontal burrows with stiff walls, being systems of short units connected with one another. Some of the units contain faecal pellets produced by the host animal.",

From a relatively deep reef slope up to the shallow shelf−edge, corals have been recognized to be encrusted by different types of foraminiferan assemblages that differ on the basis of relative abundance of species, growth form and type of encrusted coral surface. The succession of encrusting foraminiferan assemblages is interpreted as controlled mainly by light, com− petition with coralline algae, hydrodynamic energy, and coral growth fabric.",

The majority of the teeth and skeletal elements can be referred to juveniles (mostly in the estimated 2-3 m total body length range), but large, presumably adult individuals (up to an estimated total length of 6 in) are also represented. Available data indicate that the Kristianstad Basin population of C. propython represents a short-lived migration, most likely from the Mississippi Embayment in North America. The local extinction of Clidastes in southern Sweden, tentatively placed at the early/late Campanian boundary (sensu germanico), may coincide with that in the Western Interior Seaway and Gulf Coast of North America. Within the Kristianstad Basin area, Clidastes occurs in high-energy, shallow water deposits, where it is the most common mosasaur. This finding is in stark contrast to recent publications suggesting that Clidastes inhabited mainly off-shore, deeper waters. (Less)",

Several species had a very wide spatial distribution with recorded occurrences in both hemispheres. We have examined isolated teeth of Cretoxyrhina and Cardabiodon from eastern Russia, Mangyshlak in Kazakhstan, and the Western Interior of the USA. The material indicates that samples of isolated teeth of the two genera have high potential in intercontinental correlation of the upper Albian to mid-Turonian interval in mid-palaeolatitude deposits, poor in other age-diagnostic fossil groups. The utilization of these lamniforms in mid-Cretaceous biostratigraphy is currently hampered by the nearly total absence in the literature of well illustrated, well dated and sufficiently large samples of isolated teeth of the two genera. As a first Step towards the establishment of an intercontinental elasmobranch zonation for mid-Cretaceous strata in temperate palaeo-regions, we describe and illustrate samples of teeth of Cardabiodon venator SP. nov. and Cretoxyrhina mantelli from the lower middle Turonian Collignoniceras woollgari regulare Zone in the Fairport Member of the Carlile Shale in east-central Montana, USA. These samples could serve as reference points for future biostratigraphic studies of Cretoxyrhina and Cardabiodon.

The systematics of the genus is outside the scope of the present study but, as a generally accepted basal tetanuran, the braincase was CT scanned to provide a description of the endocranium, inner ear, pneumatic, and venous sinus systems in a primitive member of this clade. Five major subregions of the theropod endocranium are distinguished for the purpose of simplifying cranial computed tomographic interpretation and to provide a systematic means of comparison to other endocrania. The skull morphology of Ceratosaurus influences the overall braincase morphology and the number and distribution of the major foramina. The low pontine angle and relatively unflexed braincase is considered a more primitive character. The orientation of the horizontal semicircular canal confirms a rather horizontal and unerect posture of the head and neck. As in birds, the narrower skull morphology of Ceratosaurus is as− sociated with fewer cranial nerve foramina. Additionally, the maxillary dominated dentigerous upper jaw of Ceratosaurus is felt to share with the alligator a large rostrally directed maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve and a small ophthalmic branch. The upper bill of birds, being dominated by the premaxillary and lacking teeth, is innervated predominantly by the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. For this reason, avian−based cranial nerve reconstructions are felt to be inappro− priate for basal theropods. Ceratosaurus skull pneumatization and possible evidence of olfactory conchal structures is on the other hand very avian in character. Based on computed tomography, Ceratosaurus is determined to have possessed a typical basal theropod endocranium and bipedal vestibular system similar to Allosaurus.

The lophophore, with clearly pre− served tentacles, corresponds to an early spirolophe developmental stage. The digestive tract consists of a mouth, esopha− gus, distended stomach, intestine and an anterior anus, and differs from that of the Chengjiang obolid Lingulella chengjiangensis by the presence of the dilated stomach and by the absence of a looped intestine as in Lingula. In addition, the relative sizes of the mantle and visceral cavities of Lingulellotreta malongensis also are described.

Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 50 (3): 581–594. A new genus and species belonging to Dyrosauridae, Arambourgisuchus khouribgaensis, from the Thanetian (Palaeo− cene) of Morocco, is erected. Two more or less complete skulls and three mandibular fragments enable a reconstruction of the anatomical characteristics of this species. Dyrosaurid systematics is mainly based on mandibular characters. The com− parison of this new material with several dyrosaurid species previously known provides new systematic data for this group. The width of the interfenestral bar, the shape and development of the occipital tuberosities and the shape of the supraoccipital and the basioccipital are of particular importance. A phylogenetic analysis of the dyrosaurids provides an outline of the relationships between the best known species. Chenanisuchus lateroculi is the most primitive dyrosaurid. Sokotosuchus ianwilsoni and Phosphatosaurus gavialoides form a clade, more closely related to other dyrosaurids than to Chenanisuchus lateroculi. The relationships between Arambourgisuchus, Rhabdognathus, Congosaurus, and Hypo− saurus are unclear, and the two latter taxa remain too poorly known to provide an uncontested phylogenetic result. The dyrosaurids are known from nearly all continents. The phylogenetic results suggest a North African range for basal mem− bers, and the wide distribution of Rhabdognathus and Hyposaurus confirms the possibility of transoceanic dispersal of these taxa. Unfortunately, many dyrosaurids are insufficiently known to be included in the analysis, and the present analy− sis considers mainly African forms. A better knowledge and the inclusion of other taxa from other geographic regions should significantly improve and modify the hypothesis.

Addition− ally, an incomplete upper dentition of D. coyi from the Scollard Formation extends the range of this species into the Lancian, co−eval with D. vorax and D. padanicus. Stagodontids are in accord with other North American Late Cretaceous marsupials for which the appropriate parts are known in lacking diastemata between the canines and the molars while pos− sessing well−developed palatal vacuities, implying that these morphologies characterized ancestral marsupials. If so, the diastema between P1 and P2 in the Asian middle Early Cretaceous “metatherian” Sinodelphys szalayi is convergent on that in Cenozoic didelphids, and the absence of palatal vacuities in South American Paleogene and Neogene borhyaenids is derived, representing a paedomorphic truncation of development. Claims that the Asian Late Cretaceous “metatherian” Deltatheridium pretrituberculare had a marsupial−like dental replacement pattern are tautological, deduced from an a pri− ori acceptance of a marsupial model of replacement to the exclusion of other, no less realistic, alternatives. The new speci− mens of Didelphodon coyi demonstrate that upper and lower premolars occluded broadly, implying that the inflated lin− gual lobes characteristic of Didelphodon premolars evolved primarily as a crushing mechanism, not for passive protec− tion of the gums. Recent speculations that stagodontids were aquatic are not based on credible morphologic or taphonomic evidence and are dismissed, as is speculation that the Judithian species of Eodelphis are sexual morphs of a single species. Current knowledge of Didelphodon compels correction of numerous errors concerning its morphology as presented in recent analyses of marsupial relationships.",

Sclerothorax is characterized by various autapomorphies (subquadrangular skull being widest in snout region, ex− treme height of thoracal neural spines in mid−trunk region, rhomboidal interclavicle longer than skull). Despite its pecu− liar skull roof, the palate and mandible are consistent with those of capitosauroid stereospondyls in the presence of large muscular pockets on the basal plate, a flattened edentulous parasphenoid, a long basicranial suture, a large hamate process in the mandible, and a falciform crest in the occipital part of the cheek. In order to elucidate the phylogenetic position of Sclerothorax, we performed a cladistic analysis of 18 taxa and 70 characters from all parts of the skeleton. According to our results, Sclerothorax is nested well within the higher stereospondyls, forming the sister taxon of capitosauroids. Palaeobiologically, Sclerothorax is interesting for its several characters believed to correlate with a terrestrial life, although this is contrasted by the possession of well−established lateral line sulci.",

    "abstract": "Internal moulds of the relatively small− to moderate−size shells of Early Devonian ectocochleate cephalopods (typically <150 mm diameter) occasionally display traces of repaired shell damage. Presumably, these animals with their highly specialized buoyancy device, the phragmocone, lived in the water column. It is uncertain as to how the shells of these ani− mals were damaged; one likely cause would be predatory attacks but the identity of the perpetrator remains uncertain. So far, no remains of arthropods capable of breaking or cutting shells have been found in the fossiliferous outcrops of this age in the Anti−Atlas (Morocco). The only macrovertebrate remains of this age are of acanthodian and placoderm fish which probably lived a more or less benthonic life style. Additionally, a fish attack on these cephalopods would probably have destroyed most of the thin−shelled conch and killed the animal. Most of the repaired shell breaks are triangular in shape which is characteristic for cephalopod bite marks. Additionally, the paired arrangement of the fractures in over 70 bactritoids supports the hypothesis that it was a cephalopod attacking another cephalopod. It cannot be excluded with cer− tainty that occasional vertebrate attacks left traces on their shells. Fossil evidence indicates that the development of tightly coiled conchs was a rapid evolutionary event in the Ammonoidea in the Early Devonian; however, the evolution of coil− ing is probably not directly related to predation pressures because the ratio of injured to healthy specimens is roughly the same in Zlichovian bactritoids with orthoconic and ammonoids with coiled shells.",

The other elements of the apparatus Gondotella do not undergo any significant changes, except possibly for the pt element (Enantiognathus).

    "abstract": "The ultrastructure of the organic coenecium in living Cephalodiscus (Cephalodiscus) inaequatus (Andersson) studied with the transmission electron mi­ croscope reveals a fabric and pattern very similar to that recognized in living Rhab­ dopleuTa compacta (Hincks) by Dilly (1971). The same techniques used to study the ultrastructure of Jurassic Rhabdopleura kozlowskii Kulicki and Ordovician Rhab­ dopleurites primaevus Kozlowski indicate that the nature of the fibrous unit ele­ ments of the periderm and their characteristic pattern remain unchanged within the Pterobranchia, at least since the Ordovician. The results combined with those of previous studies on the ultrastructure of p,eridermal derivatives in graptolites (Towe & Urbanek, 1972; Urbanek & Towe, 1974, 1975), reveal a substantial difference at the submicroscopic level between the fusellar component of the periderm in the pterobranchia and that of the Graptolithina. The presumed homology between fusellar tissues of both groups constitutes the main argument in Kozlowski's suggestion (1938, 1949, 1966a) of a close affinity between pterobranchs and graptolites. A reevaluation of his line of reasoning enables us to conclude that Kozlowski's main criterion of homology was the specificity of the structures involved. This requirement is not fulfilled at the ultrastructural level because of substantial differences in the nature of the unit elements and their pat­ tern. Moreover, other data on the ultrastructural anatomy of graptolites (very early deposition of cortical tissue over juvenile thecae; presence of cortical deposits over the inner surface of thecae; simultaneous secretion of successive fuselli and cor­ responding layers of cortical tissue) contradict the mode of secretion of the grap­ tolite skeleton as suggested in the classical Kozlowski hypothesis. In contrast to the independent origin of fusellar and cortical tissue suggested by Kozlowski,each being secreted by a different part of the body, the ultrastructural data are indicative of a uniform mode of secretion. A secretion of the entire periderm within an epithelial evagination - the perithecal membrane - appears to be more readily compatible with the ultrastructural studies. Substantial differences in fabric, pattern, and mode of secretion of fusellar ex­ tracellular tissues in pterobranchs and graptolites produce serious obstacles for homo­ logy between them. Accordingly, there is little reason to suggest an immediate phylogenetic relationship between pterobranchia and Graptolithina. The systematic position of the ratter group within the Bilateria remains an unresolved problem.",

These micro­ fossils have a world-wide distribution and are particularly common in certain Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous limestones. They are often associated with ra­ diosphaerid calcispheres and in the Devonian sometime with Amphipora. The presence of autochthonous and abundant volvocacean algae in sediments, up till now interpreted as marine or restricted marine deposits, probably indicates brackish (oligohaline) or fresh-water depositional environments similar to modern strongly eutrophized lakes.

Studies on all representatives of the family Anomalinidae Cushman, 1927 has allowed the writer to extend the knowledge of the microstructure of their wall, of the alternation of generations and of the position of proloculus in the test. The results of these studies contributed to, among other things, an accurate determination of the sides of test. Almost all the species of planktonic foraminifers found have been elaborated by studying the relationships of the area discussed to the Mediterranean belt. They permitted also to establish a fine stratigraphy of the Cenomanian deposits. The agglutinated foraminifers enabled the determination of the age of the beds in which the calcareous foraminifers either do not occur at all, or are very rare. Comparisons have also been conducted between the assemblages of foraminifers of Poland under study and other assemblages cited from France, north-western Germany and the platformic part of the U.S.S.R. Lithological characteristics of this area have been presented, with particular attention paid to the dependence of the occurrence of foraminifers on the type of deposits.",

    "abstract": "A global census of published records of dinosaur skin from the Mesozoic, cross-referenced against a more detailed lithological dataset from the Maastrichtian of North America, clarifies why most examples of fossilized dinosaur skin come from hadrosaurids.Globally, more published specimens of hadrosaurids exhibit preserved skin than any other major clade of dinosaur.North American Maastrichtian hadrosaurid fossils are 31 times more likely to have skin preserved than coeval dinosaur remains.This does not arise from collection methodology, the large population size of hadrosaurids, or the gross lithology of their depositional environment.The reason that so many hadrosaurid fossils have skin is still elusive, but was likely something intrinsic to hadrosaurids that originated early on in the clade, perhaps the possession of tougher or thicker skin.The database of published examples of fossilized dinosaur skin assembled here will assist the continued development of a much needed common terminology and taxonomic framework for dinosaur skin.",

    "abstract": "The diet of the extinct European cave bear, Ursus spelaeus, has widely been debated.Diverging from the extant brown bear (Ursus arctos) approximately 1.2 million years ago, the cave bear is one of the most ubiquitous fossil bears occurring in Europe during the middle and Late Pleistocene.Early morphological studies suggested that the cave bear was likely specialized on processing tough and/or abrasive foods, while later two-dimensional low-magnification microwear studies suggested that they were omnivorous and may have consumed more bone than U. arctos.Here, we used dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) to further interpret the diet of the cave bear.Microscopic wear features were assessed and compared to modern ursids, including the cave bears' closest living relative, U. arctos.Results suggest that U. spelaeus consumed a diet with a diversity of textural properties, similar to most other bears and only distinguishable from the hyper-carnivorous polar bear (Ursus maritimus).Further, only U. maritimus can be distinguished from all bear species here examined (i.e., the giant panda bear, Ailuropoda melanoleuca; sun-bear, Ursus malayanus; spectacled bear, Tremarctos ornatus; American black bear, Ursus americanus; and U. arctos), with significantly greater area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc) of microwear surfaces.The DMTA of A. melanoleuca also has significantly lower Asfc than T. ornatus and U. americanus, consistent with observed dietary behavior.As modern bears vary their diets seasonally and across their range, it may be difficult to characterize the dietary ecology of extinct bears using dental microwear alone.Nevertheless, DMTA here demonstrates that U. spelaeus had a diet distinct from the hyper-carnivorous U. maritimus and instead likely consumed food with textural properties most similar to other herbivorous/omnivorous bears.Lastly, the European cave bear and North American giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus) may have had similar diets as evident from DMTA, with U. spelaeus potentially eating tougher food items.",

The studied specimen shows a\r\ntapered structure embedded in a cylindrical soft body. Morphological, ultrastructural and geochemical features of the\r\nspecimen suggest that it corresponds to an internally-shelled cephalopod exhibiting a tapered micro-laminated gladius\r\nwith rachis, narrow median and lateral fields and a large conus; a pair of posterior large fin-supported cartilages and\r\nfins; ventral and dorsal mantle band-shape structures, the dorsal one being cartilaginous; mantle patches; a stomach\r\ncontaining undigested arm-hooks and sheet-like pieces of potential flooded ink. Coupled SEM/EDS analyses show\r\nthat (i) arm-hooks and ink were pseudomorphed by nanoparticles (less than 0.6 mm in diameter) of carbon, (ii) gladius\r\nand soft tissues were substituted by granules of calcium phosphate, (iii) cartilage canalicula’s were partially filled with\r\ncalcium phosphate grains and crystals of Zn- and S-containing minerals.

This family assumedly falls\r\nin Myopsida (Decabrachia). A streamlined body, large fin-supported cartilages and eroded arm-hooks in the stomach of\r\nIdahoteuthis Doguzhaeva and Brayard gen. nov. suggest that this was a maneuverable cannibal predator that dwelled in\r\nthe subequatorial shallow sea of the west coast of Pangaea.",

Most samples are characterised by their high species diversity. Talpa minuta is the most common species in nearly all samples. Leptoscaptor is characterised by a slender humerus and by the loss of lower antemolars. It is interpreted as a Miocene offshoot of the Scalopini. Myxomygale gracilis represents the latest re− cord of the genus. Tenuibrachiatum storchi has a slender humerus and one lower incisor is lost. The species is structurally ancestral to the extant Urotrichus. The genus Pseudoparatalpa Lopatin, 1999 is considered a synonym of Paratalpa. The talpids of the Petersbuch fissures are in line with a Middle Miocene correlation of MN 7+8 as already indicated by the cricetids. The remains of desmans in the Petersbuch 6 fissure filling indicate the proximity of water. The presence of Urotrichini in nearly all samples, albeit scanty, suggests a forestal environment within the range of the owls, which preyed on them.",

At the initial stage of ontogeny, in Caryophylliidae (Miocene Canjophyllia salinario, C. depauperata, Recent C. berteriana) and Flabellidae (Miocene Flabellum roissyanum Recent Jauania cailleti), wall and septa are formed simultaneously, and their trabecular structure is coalesced (marginothecal wall). At subsequent juvenile stage in Caryophylliidae the presence of the extensive exosarc enables formation of costo-septa and, in consequence, formation of trabeculotheca. Trabeculotheca consists of fragments of primordial wall located between the costosepta. The trabeculothecal segments vanish in the adult stage in the majority of corals when the septothecal wall is formed by thickening of the costo-septa. In others, however, marginotheca can be present throughout the whole ontogenetic sequence (C. salinaria). Most Flabellidae are characterized by limited expression of exosarc and the presence of marginothecal wall up to the adult stage. The origin of 'flabellid' organization in Caryophylliina may result from a simple modification of ontogeny - extention of initial morphology to later ontogenetic stages. Such corals could develop several times, and the Flabellidae may be polyphyletic.",

A major change in the ostracod fauna takes place above the limestone with Wocklumeria within the transitional interval represented by clays and claystones with tuffites in its middle part.

In three specimens, the lower mandible is embedded within the living chamber of Germanonautilus conchs. Beak elements of Germanonautilus differ from those of Recent Nautilus in the more elongate appendages of the fossil lower mandibles and the weaker sculpture on the originally chitinous parts. Furthermore, the dorsal sculpture of the fossil conchorhynchs consists of ridges rather than denticles and the ventral sculpture of the fossil rhyncholiths displays ridges in places where the Recent rhyncholiths have a smooth surface. Additionally, the fossil beak elements attained a larger size than their Recent counterparts. During transport of 'Rhyncholithes hirundo', the light chitinous parts served as a sail and the heavier conchorhynch anchored in the sediment causing alignment. In contrast to the irregularly embedded isolated rhyncholiths, the conchorhynchs usually settled with their ventral side up. From the study of 407 fossil nautiloid beak-elements, a significant variability of the hard parts is evident. Consequently, the assignment of specific morphologies to the species of Germanonautilus is impossible.",

The concept of biologically mediated growth of coral skeleton stands in opposition to the purely mineralogic concept of fiber growth of Bryan and Hill (1941) widely applied until recently in geological and paleontological lit− erature. Presence of active mineralizing organic components within the skeleton explains various patterns of microstructural organization more accurately than the mineralogic concept of ‘crystal growth competition’ of Barnes (1970) alone.

However, these approaches tell little about the proximate causes of species loss. The contention that failure of metapopulation dynamics is at the root of many species extinctions is so far not borne out by observed rates of inter-population movement. Rather, most species that have a metapopulation structure seem to have central source populations and peripheral sink populations. Much of the extinction recorded in the ecological literature is probably of such peripheral populations and their loss has little to do with species extinctions. The disappearance of central, source populations is more important but its causes are not well documented. Habitat loss is the single greatest ultimate cause of current extinction. However, disappearance of the very last individuals of the last population of a species may not be obviously related to habitat loss. Rather, it may seem mysterious, because the last individuals will look healthy, or it may seem attributable to one of the stochastic forces widely assumed to set minimum viable population sizes.",

The P. idoneus L.? sherrardae lineage shows distinct gracilization, a n apomorphic feature, while the other one preserves ancestral robustness, a plesiomorphic character.

Similar diversity changes of brachiopods are observed in other Tethyan regions, including the well-studied Bakony Mountains, although in NW Caucasus the recovery after demise have begun earlier.

The new data refute some previous interpretations of the morphology of this species, and have implications for the phylogenetic position of Wonambi relative to extant snakes and other fossils, including other Madtsoiidae. The nature of contacts among palatal, braincase, snout, and mandibular elements imply similar functional attributes to those of extant anilioid snakes: maxillae from multiple individuals show corrugated contact surfaces for the prefrontal, implying a tight suture; structures on the anterior and medial surfaces of the palatine choanal process are interpreted as forming extensive contacts with the vomer and parasphenoid; and the distinctly bounded facets on the basipterygoid processes and pterygoid imply little or no capacity for anteroposterior sliding of the palatopterygoid arch, hence absence of the macrostomatan 'pterygoid walk'. On the frontal, interolfactory pillars were either absent or very slender, and a deep, sculptured contact surface for the nasal implies a prokinetic joint was also absent. Margins of the frontal and parietal indicate broad entry of the sphenoid into the ophthalmic fenestra, as in Dinilysia. Similarity of elements and features of the braincase (trigeminal foramen, ear region, and basipterygoid processes) with both lizards and extant snakes show that differences between snakes and other squamates have sometimes been overstated. The case for macrostomatan affinities of Wonambi is not supported by new evidence.",

    "abstract": "Test−drilling predation by cassid gastropods on minute clypeasteroid echinoids has been studied in the fossil assemblage of the Heterostegina Sands (middle Miocene, Holy Cross Mountains, Poland). The analysed prey, collected from two sublithofacies of the Heterostegina Sands (coarse−grained Heterostegina Sands and fine−grained Heterostegina Sands), represent three species of Echinocyamus (E. linearis, E. pusillus and E. pseudopusillus). The drill holes were produced presumably by one cassid species, Semicassis miolaevigata. The investigation showed that drilling predation intensities varied among the prey species. Within both fine− and coarse−grained sands, E. linearis was drilled more frequently than E. pusillus. An intermediate value of drilling predation was recognised for E. pseudopusillus. The intensities of drilling pre− dation recognised for some of the prey species (E. pusillus) varied also between (but never within) the sublithofacies. Drilling predation was both size− and site−selective. Larger individuals of E. linearis and E. pusillus were attacked more frequently and the aboral side of the test of all Echinocyamus species was drilled preferentially. An extremely high con− centration of drill holes was observed in the apical disc and petals. Results obtained for the most abundant prey (E. linearis) indicate that the predatory behaviour of large cassids was somewhat different from those typical of small cassids. Large cassids drilled and consumed their prey almost always individually, whereas small cassids sometimes preyed upon the urchins in a group. Large cassids displayed also a higher site−selectivity. They more frequently drilled in the petals and apical disc. The patterns of drilling predation were most likely controlled by the potential energetic value of prey (mea− sured by the internal volume/test thickness ratio), prey and predator mobility, prey mode of life, thickness and porosity of the prey's tests, as well as by the proportions between the size of the prey and size of the predator. The results suggest that the mode of life of the prey and its test structure can influence the drill hole morphology.",

These infested crinoids are represented by 5 stem−based species: Tantalocrinus scutellus, Schyschcatocrinus creber, Gilbertso− crinus vetulus, Pentagonostipes petaloides, and Cycloocetocrinus sp. They were fouled by 19 species of suspension−feed− ing epibionts, including saccamminid foraminiferans, rugose and tabulate corals, cyrtinitid and productid brachiopods, “ctenostome bryozoans”, “cyclostome bryozoans”, cystoporate bryozoans, and rhabdomesid? bryozoans, crinoids, and organisms of uncertain affinities. The majority of these epibionts were opportunistic commensals colonizing living cri− noids, and only some utilized dead crinoids as hard substrate for attachment. At least some of these epibionts seem to have settled selectively on particular crinoid host species.",

This suggests that the new genus might be a connecting link between Xenusion and Aysheaia. Besides, Jianshanopodia shares some features with the Early Cambrian stem group arthropod Pambdelurion Budd, 1997, and Kerygmachela Budd, 1993, e.g., the pairs of mid−gut diverticula, the possible presence of tail fan, the mouth cone, the frontal pharyngeal structures and the pharynax are surrounded by the bases of the large frontal appendages. However, compared with a series of segmentally arranged, imbricating, paddle−shaped, movable lateral flaps of both Pambdelurion and Kerygmachela, Jianshanopodia possesses distinct complex appendages with tree−like or lamellate branches. The dis− covery of this rare transitional form not only throws new light on the early diversification of lobopods, and may also have significance with respect to the origin of arthropods.",

For the first time, the early ontogenetic skeletal characters of these gastropods are de− scribed. Based on these features an indirect larval development with a planktotrophic veliger could be reconstructed for all investigated Mid−Miocene species. The status of Mohrensterniinae as a subfamily of the Rissoidae is confirmed by the mor− phology of the low conical protoconch, consisting of a fine spirally sculptured embryonic shell and a larval shell which is smooth except for growth lines. Transitions from embryonic shells to larval shells and from larval shells to teleoconchs are slightly thickened and indistinct. Whilst representatives of the subfamily Rissoinae characterise the marine Badenian assem− blages, Mohrensterniinae predominate the Early Sarmatian faunas. We hypothesize that this take−over by the Mohren− sterniinae was triggered by changes in the water chemistry towards polyhaline conditions. Consequently, the shift towards hypersaline conditions in the Late Sarmatian is mirrored by the abrupt decline of the subfamily. Four new species Rissoa costeiensis (Rissoinae) from the Badenian and Mohrensternia hollabrunnensis, Mohrensternia pfaffstaettensis, and Mohrensternia waldhofensis (Mohrensterniinae) from the Early Sarmatian are introduced.",

The ancora structures are considered homologous, and the ancorate petalolithids are considered to be the direct ancestors to the retiolitids. The Retiolitidae are unique among the diplograptoids in pos− sessing (1) outer, lateral, ancora sleeve walls (derived from distal extension of the ancora), and (2) a skeletal framework of bandaged lists between which are a succession of very thin and rarely preserved fusellar layers. Retiolitids possess differ− ent kinds of thecal profiles and two types of micro−ornamentation on the lists, and these have served to distinguish be− tween the subfamilies Retiolitinae and Plectograptinae. Complete retiolitid morphological terminology is clarified and explained. Cladistic analysis of the retiolitids provides some measure of a better understanding of retiolitid evolution, but adds only modest support for the retention of the two subfamily categories.",

The skull is incomplete, and its estimated length in life is 130 mm. The skull can be assigned to the Akidnognathidae with some confidence. The stratigraphic age of the specimen and its locality are not known, but the surrounding sediment suggests that it may be from the Upper Permian Dicynodon Assemblage Zone. It has five or six postcanine teeth, and a poorly developed crista choanalis. The sinuses and canals of the snout are recog− nized, and it is believed that the sinus positioned posteriorly in the snout (posterior maxillary sinus) is homologous with the maxillary sinus of anomodonts and cynodonts. It also shows similarities to the infraorbital canal of early mammals, such as Morganucodon. An anteriorly positioned sinus (anterior maxillary sinus), situated directly behind the canine root, is homologized with the maxillary sinus of gorgonopsians. In addition, I identify the previously undescribed canal (desig− nated anterior maxillary canal), leading from the anterior maxillary sinus antero−dorsally.

This is the first report of Monjurosuchus from Japan, but a long-necked choristodere, Shokawa, has already been recorded from these deposits. Monjurosuchus was first described from the Lower Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China, although it has only recently been recognised as a choristodere. As reconstructed, the Japanese Monjurosuchus differs from the type species, Monjurosuchus splendens, in the structure of the postorbital region, reduction of the quadratojugal, a slenden parietal with a deep groove along the interparietal suture, and elongation of the jugal. As in M. splendens the lowest temporal fenestrae are closed. A cladistic analysis was performed in order to place Japanese and Chinese taxa, including the incompletely described Chinese long-necked Hyphalosaurus lingyanensis, into choristoderan phylogeny. The results support the monophyly of Neochoristodera and a Sino-Japanese clade of long necked choristoderes. The placement of the European Tertiary Lazarussuchus remains problematic, but the analysis supports its placement within Choristodera rather than on the stem. The identification of Monjurosuchus from Japan provides and additional link between the fossil assemblages of the Tetori Group and those of the slightly younger Jehol Biota of China.",

Trachyteuthis hastiformis, a comparatively large vam− pyropod coleoid, was previously known to represent the sole species of its genus in Nusplingen and Solnhofen. However, morphological comparisons based on 50 specimens from different museum collections revealed two additional species: T. nusplingensis sp. nov. and T. teudopsiformis sp. nov. Both species lack the distinct spindle−shaped elevation on the gladius median field typical for T. hastiformis. T. nusplingensis sp. nov. is clearly characterised by a smooth median field and a more or less regular granulation on the dorsal gladius surface, whereas T. teudopsiformis sp. nov. can be easily dis− tinguished by the presence of a Teudopsis−like median keel and an extremely narrow granulation. Morphometric analyses have shown that length−width indices are ambiguous characters to differentiate between the three species. Phylogeneti− cally, the keeled and anteriorly pointed T. teudopsiformis sp. nov. can be linked with the Early Jurassic genus Teudopsis and the Late Cretaceous genus Glyphiteuthis.",

    "abstract": "The paper examines the systematics, phylogeny and biogeographical history of Barnea (Anchomasa), which is one of the most abundant and diversified of modern pholadid bivalves.The range of morphology of its distinctive characters and comparisons with other pholadoidean taxa are described in detail.An extensive cladistic analysis based on morphological characters at genus and subgenus levels allowed the inclusion of B. (Anchomasa) into the phylogeny of Pholadoidea and the establishment of its most appropriate taxonomic position.The analysis confirms that Barnea s.s. and B .(Umitakea) are its closest relatives and that the morphological similarities to other taxa are mainly due to plesiomorphies.The fossil record and the data on the present-day distribution contributed to trace the biogeographical history of B. (Anchomasa).The present-day biogeography is marked by the disjunct distribution of species.Species are distributed mainly either along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the American continent (American group) or in the Indo-West Pacific region (Indo-West Pacific group).Both these groups have distinct morphological features and biogeographical structures.The fossil record and the known geodynamic scenario suggest a relationship of direct derivation between the Indo-West Pacific group and a stock of north-eastern Atlantic to Paratethyan species.This reflects a vicariant event related to the closure of the connection between western Tethys and the Indian Ocean in the Middle Miocene.The American group presumably arose from the European stock during the Late Pliocene by dispersal towards the eastern coasts of North America and rapid southward diffusion.A relative differentiation within the American group is probably related to the last phases of emergence of the Panama Isthmus.The cladistic analysis also gives suggestions for the reconstruction of the phylogeny of the superfamily Pholadoidea.It confirms the interpretation of several characters sustained by previous authors.However, it also shows remarkable differences to the previous taxonomic arrangements.Pholadinae includes only taxa having the protoplax and it appears to be the sister-group of a major clade composed mainly of two groups, namely Martesiinae-Jouannetiinae and Xylophagainae-Teredinidae. The Martesiinae are paraphyletic whereas the obligate wood-boring Xylophagainae and Teredinidae form a well-supported monophyletic group.",

    "abstract": "Adapisoriculidae are an enigmatic group of small mammals known from the late Cretaceous of India, and from the early Palaeocene to early Eocene of Europe and Africa.Based on their primitive dental morphology, they have been classified as didelphids, nyctitheriids, leptictids, mixodectids, tupaiids, and palaeoryctids.While the latest hypothesis based on dental morphology suggests an affinity with Lipotyphla, postcranial remains indicate a close relationship with Euarchonta.Here, we present new adapisoriculid dental remains from the early Palaeocene locality of Hainin (Belgium).Adapisoriculidae are particularly abundant in Hainin, where they represent about one third of the mammalian fauna, offering new insights into both their specific and generic phylogenetic interrelationships.We describe three new species (Afrodon gheerbranti sp.nov., Bustylus folieae sp.nov.and Proremiculus lagnauxi gen.et sp.nov.) and document the previously unknown lower dentition of Bustylus marandati.The diversity of dental morphologies observed in the Hainin fauna suggests different interrelationships than previously suggested.In particular, the genus Proremiculus is considered morphologically intermediate between Afrodon and Remiculus, and the latter is no longer recognised as the sister group of Adapisoriculus.Although the highest diversity of adapisoriculids occurs in Europe, the oldest and most primitive members of the family were found in India and Africa, respectively.The geographic origin of the family could thus be located in any of these three continents, depending on the importance attributed to each of these factors.The coexistence of primitive and derived adapisoriculids at Hainin might indicate a very quick diversification in Europe, probably starting around the K-T boundary.",

    "abstract": "About 150 Mesozoic (mostly Early and Middle Jurassic) species of the heterobranch superfamily Mathildoidea are classified into four families and 27 genera.Most taxa are assigned to the families Mathildidae, Gordenellidae, and Tofanellidae while the Triassic family Anoptychiidae holds only a single genus and is restricted to the Late Triassic.Mathilda janeti is designated as type species for the genus Promathildia.Earlier designations are invalid because they refer to species which were not originally included in the genus Promathildia.As a consequence, Promathildia is transferred from Mathildidae to Gordenellidae.The generic assignment of numerous mathildoid species is changed.The suggested classification represents an arrangement which is based on shell characters; it is not based on a cladistic phylogenetic analysis.However, a great number of fossil taxa can only be classified based on shell characters.A high mathildoid diversity has been recognized from the Late Triassic Cassian Formation.Many of these taxa are unknown form the Jurassic and probably became extinct during the end-Triassic mass extinction event.However, at least five genera (probably eight) survived the end-Triassic mass extinction event.Tricarilda, Jurilda, and Promathildia are rather conservative, long ranging groups of high Jurassic species diversity.They probably gave rise to the modern Mathildidae.One new genus is described: Angulathilda gen.nov.",

    "abstract": "During the Late Pleistocene, several possibly endemic cingulate species, known mostly from isolated osteoderms, carapace fragments, and caudal tubes, coexisted in the Brazilian Intertropical Region.Here, we describe the osteoderm microstructure of Pachyarmatherium brasiliense, as well as the glyptodonts Panochthus greslebini, Panochthus jaguaribensis and Glyptotherium sp., in order to provide additional species-diagnostic characters and shed light on their evolutionary relationships.Pachyarmatherium brasiliense lacks several derived features shared by glyptodonts and pampatheres, such as extensive bone remodeling, fibers arranged in large bundles, and relatively poorly developed layers of compact bone, thus supporting its exclusion from glyptodonts as suggested by a recent cladistic study.The osteoderm histology of P. greslebini resembles that of other species of Panochthus (e.g., Panochthus frenzelianus).By contrast, the presence of relatively thick layers of compact bone, the configuration and size of resorption areas, the absence of randomly oriented lateral fiber bundles, and the absence of an intermediary region between the compact and trabecular bone potentially support the exclusion of Panochthus jaguaribensis from the genus.Finally, osteoderms of the Brazilian specimens of Glyptodontinae share histological features with Glyptotherium floridanus, rather than Glyptodon, thus reinforcing their assignment to Glyptotherium.These results highlight the relevance of histological osteoderm characters in cingulate systematics, ands call for further and more comprehensive studies.",

    "abstract": "A new morphometric approach was developed to study morphological variation within P1 elements commonly referred to as Idiognathodus simulator, which was selected to be the biostratigraphic marker for the base of the global Gzhelian Stage (Carboniferous).This new approach combines landmark-based geometric morphometrics with eigen analyses to analyze shape variation within P1 elements of the I. simulator group, and could be used to analyze shape variation in other morphologically similar conodont groups.Specimens analyzed were obtained from three sections of the early Gzhelian Heebner Shale of the Oread cyclothem in the North American Midcontinent region, the cyclothem from which I. simulator was originally named.This analysis shows that the I. simulator group comprises a set of at least five species with asymmetrical P1 element pairs, relatively short adcarinal ridges, and a variably developed eccentric groove.Species discrimination is based on the presence of caudal and rostral lobes, character of the adcarinal ridges, and platform shape.The species I. simulator is restricted to P1 elements with a caudal adcarinal ridge that is isolated from the caudal platform margin.Idiognathodus lateralis sp.nov. is erected to include P1 elements with a caudal adcarinal ridge that is not isolated from the caudal platform margin.",

Megaflora consists of 29 taxa (6 ferns, 4 conifers, and 19 angiosperms).Geinitzia reichenbachii is the most common species.Dryophyllum westerhausianum (Richter, 1904) Halamski and Kvaček comb.nov. is a trifoliolate leaf re-interpreted as a representative of Fagales.Three species of Dewalquea are distinguished: Dewalquea haldemiana, Dewalquea insignis , and Dewalquea aff.gelindenensis.Platanites willigeri Halamski and Kvaček sp.nov. is characterised by trifoliolate leaves, the median leaflet of which is ovate, unlobed, with a serrate margin, and cuneate base.Palaeocommunities inferred from the megafossil record include: a back swamp forest dominated by Geinitzia, with abundant ferns; a Dryophyllum-dominated riparian forest; a forest with Dewalquea and Platanites willigeri possibly located in the marginal part of the alluvial plain; dunes with D. haldemiana and Konijnenburgia; a fern savanna with patches of Pinus woodlands.Palynoassemblage A from the Nowogrodziec Member, studied mostly at Rakowice Małe and Żeliszów, consists of 126 taxa, including 105 terrestrial palynomorphs (54 bryophyte, lycophyte, and pteridophyte spores, 16 gymnosperms, 35 angiosperms).The mega-and mesofossil records are dominated by angiosperms; the palynoassemblages are dominated by ferns.Palaeocommunities represented solely by the microfossil record are halophytic (with Frenelopsis and unconfirmed presence of Nypa) and pioneer vegetation.Palaeocommunities are intermediate in general character between those pre-dating the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution and modern, angiosperm-dominated vegetation.In comparison to older plant assemblages from contiguous areas laurophylls are much rarer; this might correspond to a real phenomenon of exclusion of lauroids from Santonian riparian forests.The studied assemblage is more similar to younger palaeofloras than to older ones; this might be interpreted as stabilisation of communities after a period of pronounced change related to the rise to dominance of the angiosperms.In contrast to widespread endemism among vertebrates of the European Archipelago, the plant cover consists mostly of species that are widely distributed.",

This is in conflict with a possible derivation of all the extant lacertids from a cofirmon ancestor of no earlier than Oligocene age based on the recent albumin-immunological and karyologic analyses using molecular clock methodology. Outgroup analysis of the lacenid pileus characters is applied to reconsfruct the order and rate of appearance of character states during the pre-Oligocene section of phylogeny of the lacertid clade theoretically beginning by about the Late Jurassic. Two synapomorphies are proposed for the whole lacertid clade, including Eocene Plesiolacerta: frontoparietal scales largely overlapping the parietal table with a conesponding central position of the interparietal, and presence of the occipital. Plesiolacertais the only stem lacertid known Succinilacerla is considered a member of the crown lacertids on the basis of two other synapomorphies: an integration of parietalscales and a deveĘment of early ontogenetic conffol of the pileus pattern.

Toxodon (Order Notoungulata) had an enlarged medial trochlear ridge (MTR) similar to those seen in horses. The MTR of horses serves to 'lock' the patella and ligaments in the proximal position and it likely function the same for Toxodon. The patella of Toxodon has a medial process that would have locked by wrapping around the MTR. Macraucheniid and proterotheriid litopterns may also have had knee locks, but with a different mechanism. The femora of these litopterns have deep suprapatellar fossae in which the patellae could have become lodged. Indeed, the distal end of the patella of cf. Eoauchenia (Proterotheriidae) conforms to and is supported within the suprapatellar fossa. Several glyptodontids (Order Xenarthra) have conical MTRs that would have impeded the medial patellar ligaments during the initiation of ex- tension. This would have caused patellar rotation and resulted in a complex knee exten- sion. These glyptodonts also had suprapatellar fossae, suggesting that the ligaments slid over the MTR and 'locked' during hyperextension. Locking knees in these diverse ani- mals implies that they stood for long periods of time and did not engage in intermittent, 'bout feeding' as seen in modern ruminants. Key words",

The palaeogeographical and stratigraphical records of the previously described species are extended. Plienslachian selachian faunas are not well investigated and the descnbed species in the Hasle fauna are all known from Sinemurian deposits elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Herein we describe the oldest well-sampled multituberculate assemblage from the Cretaceous of North America. The fauna is dated at 98.37 Ma and thus approximates the Albian-Cenomanian (Early-Late Cretaceous) boundary. The multituberculate fauna is diverse. Two of the multituberculates (Janumys erebos gen. et sp. n. and an unidentified taxon) are provisionally placed among 'Plagiaulacida'. Another taxon, Ameribaatar zofiae gen. et sp. n., is of uncertain subordinal affinities. The remaining multituberculates appear to represent the advanced suborder Cimolodonta and fall within the 'Paracimexomys group'. We rediagnose Paracimexomys on the basis of the type species, P. priscus, and refer to other species as cf. Paracimexomys (including cf. P. perplexus sp. n.). A revised diagnosis is also provided for Cenomanian Dakotamys. A previouslydescribed species from the Cedar Mountain Formation is placed in Cedaromys gen. n. as C. bestia, together with C. pawus sp. n. Bryceomys is represented in the fauna by B. intermedius sp. n. Relationships of Paracimexomys-group to later taxa remain obscure. However, Bryceomys and Cedaromys share a number of features with Cimolodontidae. Given these resemblances, together with the fact that Cimolodontidae retain certain plesiomorphies (stout lower incisor, gigantoprismatic enamel) with respect to Ptilodontoidea (to which they are commonly referred), we suggest that Cimolodontidae may have arisen from a clade within the 'Paracimexomys group', independent of ptilodontoids.",

Osmolskina czatkowiensis gen. et sp. nov. from Early Olenekian karst deposits at Czatkowice, west of Cracow, provides the first record from Poland. The reconstructed skull and attributed postcranial elements show a morphology closely resembling that of the Early Anisian African genus Euparkeria Broom, 1913, while differing at generic level. Both genera display the same mosaic of plesiomorphic and apomorphic character states, but share no unique apomorphic character state. They might thus be combined in the family Euparkeriidae Huene, 1920, but could also constitute two plesions of the same grade lying just below the Archosauria + Proterochampsidae node. Currently, Euparkeriidae remains monotypic because no other genus can be assigned to it with confidence. Until this problem is resolved, the term euparkeriid essentially denotes a grade of Lower to Middle Triassic non-archosaurian archosauriforms that are more derived than proterosuchid grade taxa, but lack the specializations of either erythrosuchids or proterochampsids. They were probably Pangaean in their distribution.",

The species is restricted to the holotype only (dentary with three last molars), the referred maxillary fragment with M3? is considered here as cf. Gobiconodon sp. The dental formula of G. infinitus is reinterpreted as i1–3 c1 p1–3 m1–4. G. infinitus is characterized by a short dentary symphysis; long, well−developed Meckel's groove; small, triangular−shaped pterygoid fossa; weakly developed pterygoid crest; i3 enlarged; p1–3 two−rooted; lower molars acute− to obtuse−angled, labial cingulids lacking, lingual cingulids very short, well developed mesial and distal cingulid cuspules (“e” and “d”) and prominent wear surface on the paracristid. Gobiotheriodon is similar to Tinodon (Late Juras− sic, USA; Early Cretaceous, Great Britain and Portugal) in postcanine dental formula and structure of the pterygoid fossa; it is provisionally assigned to Tinodontidae Marsh, 1887. Some taxa previously assigned to (or suggested as possible rela− tives of) “Symmetrodonta” are reviewed. Amphidontidae Simpson, 1925 is considered as nomen dubium. A new classifi− cation for “Symmetrodonta” is proposed.",

Monotreme lower molars lack a talonid, and consequently there is no basin with facets produced by the wearing action of a “protocone”; a cristid obliqua connecting the “talonid“ to the “trigonid” is also absent.

The latter layer is traversed by numerous pores which are oriented either transversally to the siphuncular surface, or have a somewhat irregularly anastomosing course. The connecting ring structure is positively correlated to the dorsal position of the scars of the cephalic retractor muscles. Asimilar type of connecting ring and a dorsal postion of retractor muscle scars also occur in lituitids, previously assigned to tarphyceratids, and in baltoceratids, previously assigned to ellesmeroceratids.

Here we describe material pertaining to a new species of the fossil lizard genus Eichstaettisaurus (E. gouldi sp. nov.). Eichstaettisaurus was first recorded from the Upper Jurassic (Tithonian age) Solnhofen Limestones of Germany, and more recently from the basal Cretaceous (Berriasian) of Montsec, Spain. The new Italian specimen provides a significant extension to the temporal range of Eichstaettisaurus while supporting the hypothesis that the Pietraroia assemblage may represent a relictual island fauna. The postcranial morphology of the new eichstaettisaur suggests it was predominantly ground-living. Further skull material of E. gouldi sp. nov. was identified within the abdominal cavity of a second new lepidosaurian skeleton from the same locality. This second partial skeleton is almost certainly rhynchocephalian, based primarily on foot and pelvic structure, but it is not Derasmosaurus and cannot be accommodated within any known genus due to the unusual morphology of the tail vertebrae.",

Assemblages of numerous rugosans (coral meadows) have been found around the outlets of venting channels irregularly forked within the Emsian mud mound sediments. The majority of rugose corals, which settled around vents, reveal a bizarre pattern of growth called here “calice−in calice”. The phenomenon of “calice−in−calice” growth is related to selective survival of coral lar− vae i.e. it is postulated that the larvae, which settled within the calices of dead individuals were more successful in their development than those that settled elsewhere. They probably use empty calices as shelters against the physical (hot or poisoning fluids) or biological (predators) factors. The empty calices also provided a hard surface for attachment. The presence of numerous carapaces of ostracods within the calices of dead rugosans suggests a strong trophic relation be− tween corals and ostracods, which lived around hydrothermal vents. The new genus and species Hamarophyllum belkai is proposed.",

There is no evidence from phylogenetic analyses to support the hypothesis that Akanthosuchus represents the postcrania of the Paleocene crocodylians Navajosuchus or Ceratosuchus. Growth marks observed in histological sections of osteoderms of the holotype of Akanthosuchus langstoni indicate that it was at least eight years old at the time of death.

Elimination of the wrong or outdated generic assignments of Late Palaeozoic and Early Mesozoic gastropods to archetypical genera such as Turbo, Trochus ,o rNatica (all with Recent type species) repre− sents an important step toward understanding the evolutionary history of the gastropods across the Permian/Triassic mass−extinction event. The first appearance of Werfenella in the Olenekian, as well as the origination of other groups of gastropods, suggests an early turnover in the aftermath of the end−Permian mass extinction event. The relatively large size of Werfenella (up to 35 mm) sheds doubt on assertions that all Early Triassic gastropods are microgastropods (Lilliput ef− fect). The new genus is placed in the caenogastropod family Purpurinidae and represents its earliest occurrence. However, a placement of Werfenella in the Archaeogastropoda (Vetigastropoda) is also possible because it resembles the paraturbinid genus Chartronella. The characteristic Werfenella rectecostata–Natiria costata gastropod association from the Werfen Formation is not found in the approximately contemporaneous Sinbad Limestone of the Moenkopi Formation (Utah, USA) nor elsewhere outside Europe. This suggests that the similarities between Olenekian gastropod faunas from the Tethys and western North America are more limited than previously thought.",

The skull of Psittacosaurus major sp. nov., is 25% larger despite very similar postcranial skeletal dimensions. Such selective skull en− largement is very unusual. Skull size in ceratopsians, in general, scales with positive allometry relative to body mass: spe− cies of greater mass have proportionately larger skulls. This pattern stands in marked contrast to that for other vertebrate herbivores, in which larger−bodied species either have proportionately similar or smaller skulls relative to body mass. Larger−bodied ceratopsians evolved skulls that are 50% or more of trunk length—as measured without their expansive cranial frill. Although contemporaneous duck−billed dinosaurs also exhibit some positive allometry in the skull, skull length remains approximately 35% of trunk length. The evolution of extraordinary absolute and relative skull size among ceratopsians appears to have been driven by sexual selection and involved the tandem evolution of reduced head mobility and an obligate quadrupedal posture.",

They have been collected at the Carcel Puncco can− yon of the Inambari River, near San Gaban in the easternmost Eastern Cordillera. Of the six species described, Euorthisina orthiformis and Paralenorthis immitatrix were already known from the Bolivian outcrops of the same An− dean Eastern Cordillera; two species are new: Ahtiella zarelae Villas sp. nov. and Paralenorthis carlottoi Villas sp. nov. The new species of Ahtiella, of late Floian age, represent the oldest record of the genus characteristic of Celtic assem− blages. During the early Mid Ordovician the genus migrated eastward from this region into the north margin of proto−Avalonia and after that, in Llanvirn times, into Baltica. During the early Llanvirn Ahtiella also migrated westward reaching the Precordillera Argentina region. Brachiopod faunal affinities suggest that there was a closer proximity of Avalonia with the Central Andean Basin, in similar temperate latitudes, than with the Southwestern European Platform, placed in very high latitude. Paralenorthis does not give any palaeogeographical signal, since it is known from all lati− tudes and palaeocontinents. Nevertheless, the occurrence of Euorthisina reinforces the Gondwanan signature of the re− gion, since this genus spread during the Arenig throughout the middle latitude belt at the Gondwana margins, although it also colonised sub−polar latitudes, coinciding with the Llanvirn transgression over North Gondwana.",

It was originally described by Seiffert in 1972 and its phylogenetic position has since been discussed. Neusibatrachus has been considered an undeterminable fos− sil, an abnormal individual, or a primitive palaeobatrachid. Here we redescribe the only available specimen, and clarify features, such as absence of palatines, nine presacrals, and procoelous vertebral centra, that have been the subject of previ− ous debates. We consider the specimen to be a postmetamorphic individual and make developmental interpretations of some of its characters. In particular, we provide evidence of a living anuran (Rana iberica) that resembles Neusibatrachus in the development of intervertebral articulations. Neusibatrachus is considered a valid genus, which differs from other anurans, except for the pipoids, in the joint presence of an azygous frontoparietal and a parasphenoid lacking the subotic alae, although it differs from the pipoids in having nine presacral vertebrae. Morphological evidence indicates that Neusi− batrachus is related to Xenoanura, the pipoid branch in the living Amphibia Tree of Life based on molecular data. More− over, it might be a member of the pipoid clade proper, which presently includes the Pipidae, Rhinophrynidae, and several fossil taxa, including the Palaeobatrachidae, although the evidence is not conclusive.",

Peak increase corresponds in a regular pattern to other periodic features in these corals. Zones of close-spaced tabulae, thickened corallite walls and well developed septal spines form bands of denser growth occurring with an annual periodicity and it is concluded that increase and therefore dimetrism is also seasonally controlled in these corals.

    "abstract": "Upper Jurassic marginal marine strata of the Lusitanian Basin (central Portugal) yield a rich benthic macrofauna from which three bivalve target taxa, i.e., Arcomytilus, Isognomon, and Eomiodon , were chosen for morphometric studies, because of their abundance both in space and time and their variability in shell shape.The shells have been analysed with regard to outline shape (Fourier shape analysis), dimensions, ornamentation (Arcomytilus) and ligament arrangement (Isognomon).Additionally, data on co-occurring fauna and palaeotemperatures calculated from δ 18 O values have been recorded.The results of the morphometric analyses have been interpreted with regard to phylogeny and palaeoecology.In all target taxa, a distinct, rapid size increase at around the Early/Late Kimmeridgian boundary is evident.Potential causes for this process are discussed, and an increase in food availability is regarded the most likely scenario.In Isognomon rugosus, a distinct change in resilifer arrangement co-occurs with size increase, resulting in the evolution of an endemic species in the Lusitanian Basin, for which the name Isognomon lusitanicus is re-established.Like in several extant Mytilidae, morphological species characterisation in Arcomytilus turns out unsatisfactory, due to high intra-specific variability.However, Arcomytilus morrisii is still regarded as a valid species that evolved in the Lusitanian Basin.Despite high shape variability, Eomiodon securiformis is also considered to be a clearly distinguished species.For all target taxa morphologic variability is discussed with regard to environment, and variation between populations is delineated.The data suggest a weak correlation of facies and shell shape in Arcomytilus, while Isognomon lusitanicus seems to develop local varieties in different subbasins.Finally, the great morphologic plasticity of bivalves from rather distinct systematic entities is shown to result from different causes, thus demonstrating that careful studies of the involved species are a prerequisite to draw correct palaeoecological conclusions.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of residual colour patterns is revealed for the first time in the European fossil Ampullinidae.The colour patterns were studied under Ultraviolet (UV) light in approximately 3100 specimens belonging to 83 species, 12 genera (Ampullina, Globularia, Crommium, Amaurellina, Pachycrommium, Amauropsina, Ampullonatica, Eocernina, Ampullinopsis, Vanikoropsis, Pictavia, and Ampullospira) and three subgenera (Globularia, Deshayesia, and Cernina within the genus Globularia).Forty-six Cainozoic species revealed residual colour patterns and 29 of them, belonging to six genera (Ampullina, Globularia, Crommium, Amaurellina, Pachycrommium, Amauropsina), are described herein as examples representing the entire diversity of the encountered colour patterns.These patterns are most diverse during the Middle Eocene coincident with the period of highest taxonomic diversity of the Ampullinidae.Four basic classes, regarded as containing possible homologous colour patterns in terms of pigments incorporation modalities, are proposed.Class I, a fluorescent wide diffuse area or spiral stripes, occurs in most of the species, while the three others are more peculiar.Class II, fluorescent axial zigzagging stripes, Class III, fluorescent axial to slightly opisthocline stripes or segments, and Class IV, fluorescent patches forming axial segments by coalescence, allow an easy distinction between the genera Globularia, Pachycrommium, and three peculiar species of Ampullina.The bauplan of the colour patterns revealed in Globularia is very similar to that of the single extant species, Globularia (Cernina) fluctuata.This supports the view of previous authors who classified them in the same genus.Furthermore, at the family level, the peculiar residual patterns belonging to classes II, III, and IV have not been observed in naticid gastropods.Thus our results for the Cainozoic fossil record are consistent with the conclusions based on anatomy and feeding habits, namely that ampullinid gastropods, regarded for a long time as belonging to the family Naticidae, constitute a family apart.",

All Miocene representatives of this genus, described so far, have been revised. It has been shown that Creusia Leach, 1817 and Pyrgoma Leach, 1817 are two different genera which, together with Pyrgomina Baluk & Radwanski, 1967, make up within the family Balanidae Leach, 1817 a separate subfamily, Creusiinae n. subfam. Furthemore, problems related to the ecology of the Creusiinae have been examined. It has been shown the growth of shells of these cirripeds is possible only within live and still growing anthozoans. The mutual relation of cirripeds and anthozoans should be determined as a commensalism. The stratigraphic distribution of the Creusiinae and problems of the phylogeny of this subfamily have subsequently been examined. On the basis of comparison of the shell structure in the genus Creusia Leach and particular ontogenetic stages in the genus Balanus da Costa, the conclusion has been drawn that the Creusiinae separated from the main stock of the Balanidae as a result of the neotenic development of a certain branch of this family which probably took place in the Oligocene.",

    "abstract": "The Late Triassic was a time of pronounced radiation in several groups of foraminifers.The rapid evolutionary processes in the Suborder Involutinina caused particularly high diversification of these aragonitic foraminifers, which became a key group for Upper Triassic biostratigraphy.Among them, Triasina hantkeni and Triasina oberhauseri are regarded as the most precise guide fossils.However, while these species are widely used, a poor documentation of the detailed test structure of T. oberhauseri has resulted in misidentifications.The exceptional preservation and abundance of Triasina oberhauseri in the Upper Triassic deposits of the Black Marble Quarry (Wallowa terrane, Oregon, USA) has allowed us to make the first detailed observations of its coiling, innermost structure and lamellae arrangement and to recognize morphological features that were either wrongly interpreted or not described in the original systematic definition of the species.In this paper, we demonstrate that the species possesses characteristics that hamper its assignment to Triasina and we propose a new genus, Aulosina, to accommodate this taxon.Placing emphasis on the accuracy of the morphological description, the diagnosis and the systematic definition of the species are here improved.The identification of innovative features in Aulosina oberhauseri (strengthenings, shortened lamellae) highlights new evolutionary trends for the lineage of Involutinina that have proved useful for the establishment of phylogenetic links between involutinid genera and for understanding the evolutive steps leading to the formation of inner-pillars in tubular foraminifers.The increasing complexity of Involutinina representatives at the end of the Triassic, notably marked by the appearance of internal structures in Triasininae, leads us to regard them as probable symbiont-bearing foraminifers.",

    "abstract": "The findings of preserved soft body parts including pedicle in the linguloid brachiopods are extremely rare in the fossil record of which the early Cambrian Chengjiang (southern China) and Burgess Shale (British Columbia) faunas are the most important.However, these characteristic Cambrian soft-bodied faunas largely disappeared from the fossil record well before the end of the Cambrian.Here we describe the first record of the pedicle in a linguloid brachiopod from the post-Cambrian strata, preserved with remarkable fidelity.Contrary to the Chengjiang and Burgess Shale-type faunas which are commonly preserved as essentially two-dimensional aluminosilicate or degraded organic carbon films or pyritized compressed fossils, the specimens now recovered from the Ordovician of China show a three-dimensional, pyritized pedicle with preserved external morphology, in detail.The presence of streamlined shell shape and burrowing shell sculpture in our specimens supports an assumption for infaunal mode of life of the genus.Since all linguloid brachiopods of the early Cambrian are interpreted as epifaunal or semi-infaunal, it seems that the here described Ordovician linguloid is the oldest representative of fully infaunal brachiopods.Apparently, the long vermiform and flexible linguloid pedicle has appeared as a functionally optimized construction.",

Among them are 6 new species, two new genera: Dysnoetocella and Pavobeisselina and one new subgenus: Vibracella (Discovibracella). Although by far the largest number of the species (22) occurs in the Baltic Danian also and thus seems to prove Danian age of the strata in question, there are reasons which seem to support a some what younger age: for example the occurrence of Dysnoetocella aenigmatica n.gen., n.sp. in the Albert Canal near Vroenhoven (Belgium), where a bryozoan fauna is found very similar to that of the Montian of Ciply near Mons. In the Montian of Ciply also Vibracella (Discovibracella) oculata n. sub g., n.sp. occurs very frequently, which is found only in the uppermost strata of the Danian, in part associated with Vibracella (Vibracella) pozaryskae. Lunulites saltholmensis Berth. so far also occurs only in the Upper Danian. Although Montian age cannot be demonstrated with certainty as lon g as no unobjectionable bryozoan fauna of Montian age overlying an authentic Danian fauna is at hand for comparison, and as long as it is not known which species of the Danian bryozoan fauna continue into the Paleocene (Danian and Paleocene are considered here as equivalent and independent stages), it seems best to consider the beds under discussion as transition beds between Danian and Paleocene or as lowermost Paleocene. This would also agree with the micropalaeontological results of Brotzen and Pozaryska (1957). The bryozoan fauna met with in the Danian and Paleocene of the boring near Sochaczew is very similar to that from Boryszew. Pachythecella anhaltina (Voigt) was found there in the Danian as an additional species, but judging from the samples at hand the total number of species is smaller. The material from Sochaczew offered no new points of view concerning the age of the bryozoan fauna from Boryszew.",

    "abstract": "Multituberculates are the most diverse and best known group of Mesozoic mammals; they also persisted into the Paleogene and became extinct in the Eocene, possibly outcompeted by rodents that have similar morphological and presumably ecological adaptations.Among the Paleogene multituberculates, those that have the largest body sizes belong to taeniolabidoids, which contain several derived species from North America and Asia and some species with uncertain taxonomic positions.Of the known taeniolabidoids, the poorest known taxon is Sphenopsalis nobilis from Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, China, represented previously by a few isolated teeth.Its relationship with other multituberculates thus has remained unclear.Here we report new specimens of Sphenopsalis nobilis collected from the upper Paleocene of the Erlian Basin, Inner Mongolia, China, during a multi-year field effort beginning in 2000.These new specimens document substantial parts of the dental, partial cranial and postcranial morphologies of Sphenopsalis, including the upper and lower incisors, partial premolars, complete upper and lower molars, a partial rostrum, fragments of the skull roof, middle ear cavity, a partial scapula, and partial limb bones.With the new specimens we are able to present a detailed description of Sphenopsalis, comparisons among relevant taeniolabidoids, and brief phylogenetic analyses based on a dataset consisting of 43 taxa and 102 characters.In light of the new evidence, we assess the phylogenetic position of Sphenopsalis and re-establish the family Lambdopsalidae.The monophyly of Taeniolabidoidea is supported in all our phylogenetic analyses.Within Taeniolabidoidea the Asian lambdopsalids and the North American taeniolabidids represent two significantly different trends of adaptations, one characterized by shearing (lambdopsalids) and the other by crushing and grinding (taeniolabidids) in mastication, which supports their wider systematic separation, as speculated when Sphenopsalis was named.",

    "abstract": "Mesosaurs were small amphibious tetrapods that lived in western Gondwana during the Early Permian or even earlier, when temperate Permo-Carboniferous conditions initiated after the glaciations that affected the southern region of Pangea.In this contribution, we applied traditional linear regression morphometrics to analyse proportions of both the skull and limb bones in more than 100 mesosaur specimens.The analyses revealed that all mesosaur bones scale remarkably close to a model of geometrical similarity (isometry), and that this pattern is particularly strong in long bones and also in the skull.These results indicate that juvenile and adult mesosaurs do not display appreciable change in bone proportions, meaning that there are few or no noticeable differences between them during growth.The well-defined isometry, and particularly, the high interrelation between metatarsals and phalanges permit us to suggest that the mesosaur hind limb is subject to notable modularity.This evidence strongly argues that the differences previously described to support three mesosaur species in Western Gondwana, might instead reflect natural intraspecific variability, taphonomic features or even possible sexual dimorphism, as recently suggested.Our study also reinforces the general plesiomorphic structure of the mesosaur skeleton, which along with some cranial specializations for ecological fitness and the evidence of strong isometric growth as we demonstrate herein, may suggest new hypotheses of relationships for mesosaurs which thus would position them as more basal amniotes than previously thought.",

These findings are inconsistent with the traditional placement of the skunks among mustelids, which is based on morphological evidence from extant taxa. This paper reports on a well-preserved cranium of a young individual, recovered from the middle Miocene deposits (MN 7+8, about 11-12 Ma) of Steinheim am Albuch, Germany. The fossil is the holotype of Palaeomephitis steinheimensis Jager, 1839, which is here recognized as a senior subjective synonym of Trochotherium cyamoides Fraas, 1870 (consequently, Palaeomephitis Jager, 1839 is a senior subjective synonym of Trochotherium Fraas, 1870). The specimen is identified as the oldest and most primitive mephitine cranium known to date, approaching the primitive morphology for the Mephitinae. It exhibits a combination of mephitine (accessory middle-ear chamber, lateral swelling of the squamosal) and mustelid (mustelid suprameatal fossa) synapomorphies, corroborating the view that skunks are derived from a mustelid ancestor. Its auditory bulla shows a slightly inflated and relatively large caudal entotympanic, which indicates that the uninflated and relatively small caudal entotympanics of adult mephitines, as well as their hypertrophied ectotympanics, are not primitive (as hitherto assumed) but derived, providing a synapomorphy that supports a sister-group relationship between the Mephitinae and Lutrinae.",

The cherty and volcanogenic-cherty deposits of the south-western Predchingiz Region and the North Balkhash Region in central Kazakhstan represent an ophiolite rock association with pelagic sediments. The Early-Middle Ordovician conodonts found in the cherty rocks are the only fossils useful for precise dating of the strata and for interpretation of the palaeobiogeographic relations. A low taxonomic diversity is typical of conodonts from these pelagic sediments. Most of them are of the Baltic type, and only some, like Paroistodus horridus and Histiodella tableheadensis, represent other, apparently more warm-water faunal elements. Deep-water conodont faunas from central Kazakhstan are coeval with the Early-Middle Ordovician conodonts from the shelf deposits of southern Kazakhstan, but the latter are taxonomically more diverse and contain warm-water forms (e.g., Juanognathus variabilis, Reutterodus andinus, Serratognathus bilobatus , and Bergstroemognathus extensus). This corroborates the idea that Kazkhstania was closer to the equator, than to the Baltic region in the Ordovician.",

Their exceptionally good preservation resulted from fossilization in diatomites. The fossil developmental series was com− pared with normal development of the contemporary anuran Xenopus laevis (Pipidae) represented by cleared and stained (alizarin/toluidin−blue) whole−mount specimens. The comparison revealed that in spite of differences in the sequence of ossification and its timing (e.g., ossification of the otic capsules and ribs was retarded in Xenopus whereas dermal ossifi− cation was retarded in Palaeobatrachus), in the number of free ribs, and in composition of the sacral region (the synsacrum in Palaeobatrachus involves two posterior presacrals, whereas there is a single sacral in Xenopus), both gen− era were similar in great number of anatomical features that appear during development. The most important difference is the shape of vertebral centrum (procoelous in Palaeobatrachus, opisthocoelous in all Pipidae) which is formed in com− paratively early developmental stages. A view that could result from anatomical comparisons is that Palaeobatrachus could be derived from the Pipidae, but this is doubtful due to biostratigraphic and palaeogeographic discrepancies. The earliest palaeobatrachids were recorded from the Late Cretaceous of Europe but pipids could not invade northern conti− nents after the Early Cretaceous when the Tethys Sea prevented interchanges of anuran faunas. Also, all palaeobatrachids retain primitive anatomical features (e.g., five pairs of ribs) that were more derived even in the earliest pipids from the Lower Cretaceous of Israel.",

The composition of ostracod assemblages changes from a moderately diverse (10 species) Entomoprimitia–Richterina– Nehdentomis–Nandania dominated “background” assemblage characterising a pre−event interval, to an Entomoprimitia−as− semblage during the event interval, and finally to a Franklinella−dominated post−event assemblage in the Middle Palma− tolepis triangularis conodont Zone. The Frasnian–Famennian extinction caused substantial losses among entomozoacean lineages. In the Plucki section it occurred in two closely spaced steps within the Palmatolepis linguiformis conodont Zone. The first step, at the base of the dark cephalopod limestone (Upper Kellwasser Horizon), reduced the abundance and the spe− cies diversity of entomozoaceans to only two Entomoprimitia species. The vacant niche was then filled by the new, immi− grant species Entomoprimitia (Entomoprimitia) kayseri which is dominant in the Upper Kellwasser interval. All these spe− cies were lost at the second step within the Upper Kellwasser Horizon. The entomozoaceans remained virtually absent dur− ing a long time interval between the end−Frasnian crisis and the Middle Pa. triangularis Zone. They reappear as new species from refugia lineages (Franklinella, Nehdentomis) and became widespread, indicating favourable ecological conditions.

The skull is more primitive in morphology than those of Pseudabassans riggsi and every other known procyonid, plausibly approaching a hypothetical primitive procyonid morphotype. The only, but methodologically fundamental, departure from this morphotype is the lack of the procyonid suprameatal fossa, which is the crucial synapomorphy of the family Procyonidae. To explain the phylogenetic and taxonomic status of the arctomorph represented by the skull, three competing hypotheses are put forward. Hypothesis A, which considers the arctomorph as an individual of Pseudobassaris riggsi, assumes that the procyonid suprameatal fossa first appeared in a common ancestor of Pseudobassaris and other procyonids but was still of variable occurence within Pseudobassaris riggsi. Hypothesis B, which proposes the arctomorph as a member of a new Pseudobassans species ancestral to Pseudobo,ssari.s riggsi, concludes that the procyonid suprameatal fossa arose in Pseudabassaris riggsi and in the Procyonidae independently, excluding Pseudobassaris from the procyonids. Hypothesis C, which recognizes the arctomorph as a representative of a new species of a new genus of the paraphyletic procyonid stem group, presumes that the procyonid suprameatal fossa originated in a common ancestor of Pseudobassaris and other procyonids after the new genus had become detached from the ancestral stock of the Procyonidae.",

They are known also from coeval abundant siliceous biota assemblages from the carbonate shelf of East European Platform including more than 150 taxa of radiolarians. However, in ecological terms, the moderately diverse Polish microfaunas (34 species of 12 genera) are more similar to these from Kolyma and Alaska, also marked by abundance of sphaerical entactiniids and near−absence of bilateral−symmetric Ceratoikiscidae and Palaeoscenididae. A succession of two distinctive siliceous sponges associations is established in the incipiently submerged Holy Cross carbonate platform: from an ephemeral, diverse, mostly rigid−skeletal lithistid−hexactinosan foreslope assemblage (initial phase of the late Frasnian Kellwasser Crisis), to long−lasting, basinal loose−skeletal hexa− ctinellid−demosponge faunas (appearing abundantly just prior the Frasnian–Famennian boundary in the late Palmatolepis linguiformis Zone). Such regional blooms of marine siliceous biotas, parallel to temporary retreat of calcareous biota, are demonstrated worldwide for the Kellwasser Crisis. These suggest probable causal links with cooling pulses and at least regional, volcanically induced eutrophication.",

Bundles of fibres are arranged in growth lamellae, and the latter form an angle of at least 45° with the inner tube wall. Where the outer tube surface projects into annular flanges, the lamellae have a chevron−like section due to the backwards deflection of the outer parts. Anabaritids are usually referred to the Cnidaria or left without systematic assignment, but earlier suggestions included affinity to the serpulid polychaetes. The chevron structure resembles that previously exclusively known from serpulids, but the presence of internal tooth−like structures in anabaritid tubes, perhaps compromising up−and−down movement through the tubes, continue to make a di− rect assignment to the Serpulida questionable.",

Two important features in the testing of this climatic model are as follows: the timing and the pattern of the diversity changes, and the particular climatic variables examined, since different patterns of evolutionary interactions would be expected depending on different climatic variables. In order to analyse the relationship between climate change and faunal events, we need to establish a set of comparable data. To provide a finely resolved picture of both climatic and faunal events, the last 32,500-years were divided into 13 chronological units of 2,500-years each. The limit of 32,500-years was imposed by the availability of good localities with radioisotopic calibration. Climatic stability was measured in these analyses in terms of cycles per unit of time, the amount of variation in temperature per unit of time, and the magnitude of change between modal temperature of one interval less modal temperature from preceding interval. The data presented here suggest that the primary effect of climatic change is on: (1) levels of extinction (or migration) of large mammals; and (2) diversity and origination (or immigration) of small mammals.",

As the shape and proportions of multituberculate, eutriconodontan, and Cretaceous eutherian endocasts are otherwise similar, one might speculate that the multituberculate and eutriconodontan brains did not differ essentially from those of primitive eutherian and marsupial mammals, in which the midbrain is exposed dorsally. This conclusion might have important phylogenetic implications, as multituberculates and eutriconodontans may lay closer to the therians sensu strico, than hitherto believed. We describe an endocast of the Late Cretaceous multituberculate Kryptobaatar, which differs from those of other multituberculates (Ptilodus, Chulsan− baatar, and Nemegtbaatar) in having unusually long olfactory bulbs and the paraflocculi elongated transversely, rather than ball−shaped. We estimate the encephalization quotient (EQ) of Kryptobaatar, using: 1) Jerison’s classical equation (1) based on estimation of endocranial volume and body mass; 2) McDermott et al.’s derived body mass estimation equa− tion (2) using upper molar lengths; and 3) estimation of body mass based on new equations (3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d1–9), which we propose, using measurements of the humerus, radius, ulna, femur and tibia. In both Jerison’s method and a mean of our series of derived formulae, the EQ varies around 0.71, which is higher than estimated for other multituberculate mam− mals. It remains an open question whether the evolutionary success of Kryptobaatar (which was a dominant mammal dur− ing the ?early Campanian on the Gobi Desert and survived until the ?late Campanian) might have been related to its rela− tively high EQ and well developed sensorimotor adaptations, in particular olfaction and coordinated movements.",

These were compared with published data on the develop− ment of Paleogene (Middle Eocene–Early Oligocene) pipids from Patagonia, and with normal development of the con− temporary pipid frog Xenopus. The comparisons of the developmental series of the Cretaceous and contemporary pipid frogs provided data on changes in the developmental pattern, namely of the degree of ossification and other developmen− tal events. In general, it seems that ossification has become considerably delayed in the course of pipid evolution, whereas most anatomical features typical for free living pipid larvae were well established as early as in the Early Cretaceous. Comparisons with the developmental series of specimens from the Late Oligocene Palaeobatrachidae (closely related to the Pipidae) from Bechlejovice near Děcin, Czech Republic revealed that some morphological differences between the two families might be explained by their developmental mode (e.g., formation of the opisthocoelous vertebral centrum in Shomronella). The uncinate process on three anterior pairs of ribs in Shomronella is the character retained in primitive anurans, and indicates close phylogenetic relations of early pipoids to discoglossoids.",

In a morphological series including Reteograptus geinitzianus, Gothograptus nassa, Holoretiolites spp. and 'Retiolies' sp. it is possible to demonstrate that sclerotization of the periderm secreted between the zooid and its mantle evagination became progressively localized, culminating in the formation of the highly specialized and sparse framework of Holoretiolites and 'Retiolites' sp. 2. In Retiolites geinitzianus (Barrande) the same kind of peridermal secretion combined with localized sclerotization to produce a superficially similar type of rhabdosome to some of those in the above morphological series, but with a quite different relationship to the secretary tissues of the zooids.",

    "abstract": "Multidisciplinary study of the Early–Middle Frasnian boundary in the north−western East European Platform (Main De− vonian Field) allows evaluation of changes in facies, brachiopod, ostracod, and conodont associations, as well as carbon isotope composition. Brachiopod and ostracod faunas, characterized by predominance of rhynchonellids, spiriferids, podocopids, and platycopids in the Early Frasnian, and by predominance of spiriferids, palaeocopids, and kloedenello− copids in the Middle Frasinan, demonstrate significant changes in dominance and diversity likely caused by regression− transgression couplets in the extremely shallow−water environment. Changes in diversity of the conodont associations, represented mainly by shallow−water polygnathids and spathognathids, are controlled by sea−level fluctuations as well; however significant evolutionary turnover is absent. Deepening pulses lead to an increasing in diversity of both the ben− thic and nectic groups, whilst regressions cause diversity fall due to progressive habitat reduction. Most prominent de− creasing in the fauna diversity is observed in the late Early Frasnian (Dubnik time) coinciding with the regressive phase of the Late Givetian to Early Frasnian eustatic cycle. Positive−negative 13C excursion, detected in brachiopod calcite from the early interval of the Middle Frasnian, can be correlated with global isotopic perturbations near the Frasnian substage boundary: the positive 2.6‰ 13C excursion is probably linked with enhanced primary production in high−nutrient re− gimes in the epeiric sea.",

It differs from the other species of Bienotheroides in having a much more reduced middle mesial cusp of PC. It further differs from B. zigongensis and B. ultimus in having shorter and wider PC, from B. ultimus in lacking a projection at the middle mesial margin of PC, and from B. wansienensis in lacking the vestigialmost mesiobuccal cusp of PC and in lacking a diastema between upper I1 and I2. This is the first discovery of the Tritylodontidae in Mongolia.

Based on recent field work and newly collected material from the Neuquen Basin, the taxonomy, mode of occurrence and palaeobiogeography of this species is reviewed. In the Agrio For− mation (Valanginian–Barremian) P. gigantea is neither abundant nor dominant, but occurs throughout the unit. It was fa− cies−dependent being restricted to well−oxygenated waters and soft to firm, sandy and bioclastic substrates of shoreface to inner shelf environments. The life habit of P. gigantea was similar to that of Recent Pholadomya candida, deep burrow− ing and sedentary, but it has not a pedal gape and accessory muscle scars related to valve closure. Thus a suspension−feed− ing habit, not a pedal−feeding system, may be inferred as is commonly suggested in other Jurassic and Cretaceous Pholadomya species. Pholadomya agrioensis is a valid taxon that is recorded in the Berriasian–Valanginian of Neuquen. It is similar in outline to P. gigantea and had probably the same basic palaeoecology, even though it has a blunt anterior margin, deep umbonal−ventral sulcus and distinct anterior ornamentation. Once in life position this species was capable of further digging in the sediment. This species probably burrowed in muddy substrates in the offshore zone. Pholadomya sanctaecrucis from the Valanginian of Europe and also recorded in Argentina is ornamented only with commarginal lines and should be removed to the genus Homomya.

Also, large naticids drilled energetically attractive prey (Hinia restitutiana and Natica tigrina) more frequently than small naticids. Preferential drilling displayed by large naticids from the Korytnica Clays increases the net energy gain for the predator and in result allows it to drill more effectively.",

Dinilysia patagonica Woodward, 1901, Coniacian in age, is considered closely allied to living anilioid snakes, and is found in clastic rocks deposited in a terrestrial inter-dune basin environment in northern Patagonia, Argentina. All three snakes are known from well preserved and articulated specimens found in sediments where detailed sedimentological and taphonomic analyses are possible. Pachyophis and Pachyrhachis were laterally compressed, have pachyostotic ribs and vertebrae, and small, narrow heads. These two snakes are interpreted as aquatic predators living in and around the margins of reef mounds on a shallow water carbonate platform. Dinilysia was a large bodied snake with a relatively large head, and is interpreted here as a terrestrial predator that lived in a dry, interdune basin environment dominated by aeolian sedimentation.

Its delicate scratch pattern, comprising one un− paired median groove and three pairs of lateral grooves, all with a regular in−phase sinusoidal wave pattern of equal wave− length, allow the reconstruction of the number, position and relative spacing of the fins. The comparatively high−ampli− tude median groove is attributed to the main propelling action of the tail or caudal fin, the inner pair of the lateral grooves to the action of the pelvic fins, and the low−amplitude outer set of duplicate grooves to bifurcated pectoral fins, respec− tively. The in−phase geometric pattern is explained by a distance between the unpaired fin (caudal or anal fin) to the pecto− ral fins corresponding to one wavelength and a position of the pelvic fins half way in between. The direction of movement and the mode of locomotion of the trace maker (a carangiform to ostraciiform type) are deduced. This analysis is leading to an acanthodian (possibly Diplacanthus) as the most probable trace maker.

The faunas are very close to the contemporaneous associations in European sections both by their taxonomic composition and by patterns of evolutionary behavior towards eye reduction. Two new taxa are described: Gondwanaspis mrirtensis gen. et sp. nov., which is the last known representative of the Odontopleuridae before its extinction at the base of the Upper Kellwasser horizon, and Pteroparia ziegleri maroccanica subsp. nov., a geographical variant of the nominal subspecies from Sessacker in the Rhenish Slate Mountains.",

As such, different possiblilties of jaw mechanisms can be tested by using kinematic analyses to make predictions about tooth wear for each mechanism, ranging from akinetic montmostyne skulls to kinetic streptostylic skulls. A hadrosaurid jaw mechanism that includes a degree of lateral rotation of the maxilla-premaxilla joint, as well as laterocaudal streptostyly and mobility of other articulations, accounts for tooth wear present in these animals better than the currently-accepted propalinal mechanism. Lateral rotation of the maxlila and concomittant motion of other cranial segments is powered by mandibular adduction and is best seen as a solution to a transverse power stroke constrained by an isognathous jaw system.",

The dental characters currently used to separate two extant species of sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus and H. nakamurai) are analysed and the fossil record of their relatives reviewed. The main results suggest that the cusp number ratio (number of cusps per mm) is preferable to width of the lower tooth for inference of total body size, at least in species of Hexanchus. The presence of a serrated edge or an enlarged acrocone appears to depend on ontogeny and care must be taken when using these as taxomomic characters. Three Eocene species of Hexanchus, H. collinsonae, H. hookeri, and H. agassizi, and a new assemblage of fossil teeth from the late Ypresian/early Lutetian (Early/Middle Eocene) of south-western France, are also analysed. The first two of these species may be ontogenetic states of H. agassizi. Hexanchus agassizi, belonging to the vituliform lineage and closely related to the living H. nakamurai, is considered here to be the only species of Hexanchus in the Lower to Middle Eocene. A brief overview of Palaeogene Hexanchus, suggests no evidence of the grisiform group (closely related to living H. griseus) before the Late Eocene.",

    "abstract": "A single specimen of the protasterid ophiuroid Protasterina flexuosa from the Kope Formation (Cincinnatian, Upper Or− dovician) of Kentucky exhibits three−dimensionally pyritized tube feet. This represents the first report of soft−tissue pres− ervation in an echinoderm from the type−Cincinnatian series. The tube feet are solid and lack all internal structure. They consist of aggregated masses of small euhedral to subhedral pyrite crystals suggesting that pyritization, although de− cay−induced and mediated, did not necessarily replicate soft−tissues but might instead have formed inside the void−spaces left behind during the decay process. The discovery of pyritized soft−tissue as delicate as ophiuroid tube feet suggests that similar forms of soft−tissue preservation might be found in other taxa in the Kope Formation. Perhaps much more impor− tantly, this unexpected occurrence demonstrates the incompleteness of our knowledge of permissible conditions for the preservation of soft−tissues and it thereby indicates promise for discovery of other such occurrences in diverse organisms in unexpected settings. Systematics of Paleozoic ophiuroids remains problematic in spite of many years of study by capa− ble paleontologists. The incomplete but well−preserved specimens treated here include the types of Protasterina flexuosa and Protasterina fimbriata as well as previously undescribed specimens. Together they permit a revised diagnosis and de− tailed description of the genus Protasterina. Protasterina fimbriata is the type species of the genus but is a subjective ju− nior synonym of Protaster flexuosus (= Protasterina flexuosa). The genus is clearly differentiated from the only other known protasterid ophiuroid from the Cincinnatian series, Taeniaster spinosus, and from all other protasterid genera.",

Uchku− dukodon nessovi is one of the smallest therians (molars about 1 mm long). Lower canine is two−rooted in Uchkudukodon gen. nov. and Bulaklestes (uncertain in Daulestes). All lower premolars in all four species are double−rooted. Teeth identi− fied as dp1, p2 and dp2 in holotype of Uchkudukodon nessovi (McKenna et al. 2000) are here identified c, p1, and p2. A phylogenetic analysis weakly supported Asioryctitheria by four synapomorphies: conular basins become distinct, the number of roots reverts to two on the lower canine, the p5 becomes longer than p4, and the metaconid on p5 is reduced and lost. Other characters diagnostic of asioryctitheres are four upper and lower premolars (arguably five upper premolars in juvenile Kennalestes), P4 has a protocone swelling or protocone, some asymmetry of the stylar shelf on M1–2, the paraconule on M1–3 is distinctly closer to the protocone than is the metaconule, protocone is of moderate height on M1–3 (70–80% of paracone or metacone height), Meckel’s groove is absent, and the mandibular foramen opens into a smaller depression on lingual side of mandibular ascending ramus. Asioryctes and Ukhaatherium are placed in Asioryctinae and along with Kennalestes are placed in Asioryctidae. Kennalestidae Kielan−Jaworowska, 1981 is a junior subjective syn− onym for Asioryctidae Kielan−Jaworowska, 1981. Because of uncertainties in the analysis, the positions of Daulestes, Uchkudukodon gen. nov., and Bulaklestes cannot be determined beyond referral to Asioryctitheria.",

Acanthodians comprise a diverse association of climatiids, diplacanthids, and ischnacanthiforms, including the previously recorded climatiid Nostolepis sp. cf. N. gaujensis, as well as one new climatiid genus and several taxa left in open nomenclature. Climatiid Iranolepis ginteri gen. et sp. nov. is diagnosed by having scales with a highly raised medial crown area separated by steep slopes from lateral crown areas; an odontocytic mesodentine of maximum extent in the crown, distinguished by extensive network of fine canaliculi with abundant tiny osteocytes; and a poorly developed stranggewebe system. Other scales with fan-like symmetrically grooved crowns conform to the Diplacanthus-type histologically, and have many characters in common with Milesacanthus antarctica from the Aztec Siltstone of Antarctica. Osseous gnathal elements include mesodentinous tooth whorls from an ischnacanthiform or climatiid, and ischnacanthiform jaw bones with large chambers for vascular canals, distinctly separated cylindrical tooth cusps along the lingual ridge, and wide-based, triangular, weakly striated cusps on the main lateral ridge. The acanthodian association, accompanied by the Frasnian conodonts of the middle Mesotaxis falsiovalis to Palmatolepis hassi zones and zonal thelodonts Turinia hutkensis and Australolepis seddoni, is proving useful for biostratigraphy, showing similarities with assemblages from both Gondwana and the Old Red Sandstone Continent.",

The systematic assignment of the genus Hederella Hall, 1881 has been discussed and the tabulate-like microstructure of the zooecial walls of this genus examined. In addition, the epifauna and associated assemblages have been characterized as well as the geological and palaeoecological conditions in which the described Bryozoa occurred.",

A combined microstructural and chemical composition study of the comparison of shells with undisputed mineralogy from the same site as the Turonian Goniocamax, shows that these aragonitic shells display the effects of diagenetic alteration. These observations favour the hypothesis that belemnite rostra are composed of primary aragonite, rather than low−Mg calcite, and are consistent with all other cephalopod shells. Calcitic and aragonitic rostra are also known in other Dibranchiata such as Triassic Aulacocerida and Eocene Belopterina. Diagenetic changes such as shown here may clearly affect palaeo−environmental interpretations based on carbonate shells.",

    "abstract": "The fossil polychaete family Polychaeturidae is considered as monogeneric and comprises four species of the genus Pteropelta. Pteropelta, originally established on isolated scolecodonts (the carriers), is revised and the apparatus-based Polychaetura is shown to be a junior synonym of Pteropelta. In addition to Pteropelta gladiata and Pteropelta kielanae, Pteropelta huberti sp. nov., and Pteropelta sp. A are herein described from the Upper Ordovician of Estonia and Sweden. Polychaeturids include some of the most common and characteristic scolecodont-bearing polychaetes in the Ordovician of Baltoscandia. They first appeared in the early Darriwilian (Mid Ordovician), flourished in the Late Ordovician and disappeared in the early Silurian. The distribution patterns of individual polychaeturid species infer regional biostratigraphical potential. Polychaeturids were geographically widespread during the Ordovician and have been recorded from at least three palaeocontinents.",

Because biodiversity patterns in the late Maastrichtian of North American are the primary data for a broad array of studies regarding non-avian dinosaur extinction in the terminal Cretaceous, intensive sampling on multiple scales is critical to understanding the nature of this event. We address theropod biodiversity in the Maastrichtian by examining teeth collected from the Hell Creek Formation locality that yielded FMNH PR 2081 (the Tyrannosaurus rex specimen “Sue”).

    "abstract": "The Early Eocene locality of La Borie is located in the village of Saint-Papoul, in southern France. These Eocene fluvio-lacustrine clay deposits have yielded numerous vertebrate remains. Mammalian taxa found in the fossiliferous levels indicate an age near the reference level MP 8–9, which corresponds to the middle Ypresian, Lower Eocene. Here we provide a detailed description of the avian remains that were preliminarily reported in a recent study of the vertebrate fauna from La Borie. A maxilla, a quadrate, cervical vertebrae, a femur and two tibiotarsi are assigned to the giant ground bird Gastornis parisiensis Hébert, 1855 (Gastornithidae). These new avian remains add to the fossil record of Gastornis, which is known from the Upper Paleocene to Middle Eocene of Europe, Early Eocene of Asia, and Early Eocene of North America. Gastornis parisiensis differs from the North American Gastornis giganteus (Cope, 1876) in several features, including the more ventral position of the external nares and the slender orbital process of quadrate. Two tibiotarsi and one tarsometatarsus are assigned to a new genus and species of Geranoididae, Galligeranoides boriensis gen. nov, sp. nov. So far, this family was known only from the Early and Middle Eocene of North America. The fossils from La Borie constitute the first record of the Geranoididae in Europe. We show that Gastornis coexisted with the Geranoididae in the Lower Eocene of both Europe (La Borie) and North America (Willwood formation). The presence of Geranoididae and the large flightless bird Gastornis on either side of the present-day North Atlantic provides further evidence that a high-latitude land connection existed between Europe and North America in the Early Eocene.",

Their shell is convolute (last whorl covers all previous ones) with a narrow, slit-like siphonate aperture bearing denticles (“teeth”). When extended, a large part of their shell surface is covered by a soft fleshy mantle. The earliest cowries were reported from the Upper Jurassic of Sicily: Cypraea tithonica and Cypraea gemmellaroi. Subsequently, these species had been assigned to various cypraeid genera. Examination of the type material of Cypraea tithonica re- veals that this species represents a new genus: Coffeacypraea Nützel &amp; Schneider. Cypraea gemmellaroi also belongs to this new genus and is potentially synonymous with Coffeacypraea tithonica. The Upper Jurassic caenogastropod genera Colombellina and Zittelia (family Colombellinidae) also have narrowly elongated siphonate apertures and are closely related to Cypraeidae but their shells are not convolute. The origination of Cypraeidae and Colombellinidae contributed considerably to the Mesozoic–Cenozoic caenogastropod radiation.",

Previously known seven species and subspecies of “Damesites” from the upper Turonian to lower Campanian in the northwest Pacific province are reassigned to one revised species of Damesites and two species of Paradamesites gen. nov. based on clear differences in developmental patterns of ribs and growth lines. The genus Damesites should be strictly applied to the north Pacific Realm’s species like Damesites damesi. On the other hand, the longestablished species “Ammonites sugata” (= “Damesites sugata”), ranging from the middle Turonian to Santonian in the African Indian, European, northwest and northeast Pacific provinces, is reassigned here to a new genus Paradamesites forming new combination Paradamesites sugata. Late Turonian “Damesites ainuanus” and Coniacian “Damesites sp.” from the Yezo Group are junior synonyms of P. sugata. Paradamesites rectus gen. et sp. nov., previously called “Damesites sugata” from the Santonian–Campanian strata of the Yezo Group is a descendant of P. sugata. The revised species of Damesites and species of Paradamesites gen. nov. cooccur sympatrically in the Late Cretaceous of north Pacific Realm. Both the revised Damesites and its ancestral genus Tragodesmoceroides originated in the north Pacific Realm, and most species during the Turonian–Campanian were endemic to the north Pacific Realm. Paradamesites, in contrast, originated in the AfricanIndian province and became widespread. Paradamesites sugata appears to have migrated from the AfricanIndian province to the north Pacific Realm during the latest Turonian–Coniacian and subsequently dispersed as a cosmopolitan species. Similar evolutionary patterns are also recognized in some other ammonoid fami lies (e.g., Gaudryceratidae, Tetragonitidae, Desmoceratidae, and Kossmaticeratidae) during the Late Cretaceous of the northwest Pacific province.",

    "abstract": "Large freshwater unionoid bivalves today are a globally distributed and diverse group, with a history dating back to the Triassic. Their evolutionary success largely depends on their reproductive behavior, today, they all take maternal care via brooding their embryos, which is only possible in the modified (advanced) eulamellibranch gills, facilitating survival in freshwaters. It can be expected that such an essential trait could have originated in the last common ancestor of advanced Unionida lineages sometime after Carnian, Late Triassic, where unionoids with filibranch gills were known, and before the Middle Jurassic, when advanced unionoids already existed. The gill anatomy of unionoids, because of their calcified gill filaments, enhances exceptional preservation of associated soft gill tissues. New Late Triassic unionoid materials from Poland with gill tissues preserved, Silesunio parvus, Tihkia silesiaca, Tihkia? sp., together with other Mesozoic materials from archival collections from Cretaceous of United Kingdom (“Unio porrectus”) and Brazil (Anodontites freitasi) provide new insights into gill evolution in Unionida. The traits observed during surface investigation supported a filibranch trait in the gill anatomy of S. parvus and Tihkia? sp. indicating the origin of evolving advanced gills took place after the Triassic. Yet, the eulamellibrach anatomy was confirmed only in Late Cretaceous A. freitasi. The preservation of the gills in the remaining specimens studied does not provide new data on the origins of advanced gills in unionoids and its more detailed timing.",

An additional eight morphospecies from two genera (Archaeomonas anterioconica Kaczmarska sp. nov., A. asharya Samanta sp. nov., A. genetynanii Ehrman sp. nov., A. jimstehrii Ehrman &amp; Kaczmarska sp. nov., A. lenistriata Kaczmarska sp. nov., A. litheusphaerellamima Samanta sp. nov., A. sextapapillatus Kaczmarska sp. nov., and Litharchaeocystis centparatethianus Ehrman sp. nov.) are proposed as new to science. We also found at least a dozen more distinct morphotypes in orientations and quantities insufficient for formal description that will be the subject of further studies. Our report is the first from the Central Paratethys and the most species rich archaeomonad flora reported from the Oligocene worldwide. The combination of previously described archaeomonad species recovered with the associated diatoms, parmaleans, silicoflagellates, ebridians, and other marine biota suggest that our stomatocysts are native to their basin and inhabited the neritic part of the Paratethys.

Hewittia albanensis was first described by Brink (1959) based on AMG 4208 collected from the Chris Hani District Municipality (former Cradock District), Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Since then, the taxon has been mostly ignored in published research. Here, we provide a redescription of H. albanensis based on a new specimen recovered from the Chris Hani District Municipality within rocks of the Lystrosaurus maccaigi–Moschorhinus Subzone of the Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone. We propose a new genus name for this species, Cradognathus, since Hewittia Brink, 1959, is preoccupied by Hewittia de Lessert, 1928, a crab spider from Congo. The position of Cradognathus within the Akidnognathidae, as well as its generic diagnosis, are revisited and discussed. The new specimen consists of an almost complete skull with some dorsoventral distortion. Cradognathus differs from other akidnognathids by the dental formula, a sharply pointed pterygoid transverse process, a median keel anterior to a short interpterygoid vacuity, and the presence of prominent lateral tuberosities at the ends of the ventromedial pterygoid flanges. We find that Cradognathus forms a clade with Euchambersia, Cerdosuchoides, and Moschorhinus within Akidnognathidae.",

Two localities have been stratigraphically and biochronologically dated to the late Eocene: i.e., Treznea and Bociu. The remaining three localities are dated to the early Oligocene: Mera, Cetățuie, and Suceag. The study of cricetid rodents corroborates the presence of this family in Eastern Europe during the late Eocene, as evidenced by the species Witenia sp., Bustrania cf. B. dissimile, and Eocricetodon cf. Eo. meridionalis. The cricetids identified in the sites of the early Oligocene age show a complete turnover and a notable increase in species richness following the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, with: Eucricetodon aff. Eu. huerzeleri, Tenuicricetodon arcemis gen. et sp. nov., Pseudocricetodon cf. Ps. montalbanensis, Paracricetodon cf. Pa. walgeri, Paracricetodon kavakderensis, Paracricetodon aff. Pa. stojonovici, and Paracricetodon wentgesi. In the context of the wider biogeographic history of Europe, these new discoveries indicate that Cricetidae arrived in Europe during at least two successive migrations from Asia in the late Eocene and earliest Oligocene. These migrations may have occurred via two different migration pathways through the north and south of Europe. In a second phase, Cricetidae arriving by the northern passway spread throughout Europe, whereas Cricetidae that arrived by the southern passway remained restricted to the central and southeastern Europe. The observations made on the Cricetidae allow for the proposal of a new, more general, scenario for the Eocene–Oligocene transition on a European scale, which is more complex than the “Grande Coupure” sensu stricto as initially proposed by Stehlin in 1909.",

    "abstract": "Recent isotopic analyses of the teeth of the extinct lamnid Carcharodon hastalis showed that it fed at a comparable trophic level as was the fossil and modern great white shark, Carcharodon carcharias. Although there are many examples of shark bite marks on marine mammal bones, there have not been any publications documenting the presence of C. hastalis teeth embedded in the bones of marine mammals. Here we report on the first C. hastalis teeth found embedded in vertebrae of two Miocene cetaceans. These teeth represent unequivocal evidence of trophic interactions between this shark and cetaceans. It is not known if these interactions were the result of active predation or scavenging. These embedded C. hastalis teeth offer supporting evidence to the aforementioned isotopic findings. The finding of C. hastalis teeth embedded in cetacean vertebrae demonstrate that in the Carcharodon lineage, serrated teeth were not a prerequisite to feeding on marine mammals. Carcharodon hastalis may have fed on marine mammals for millions of years prior to the evolution of lightly serrated teeth in its chronospecific descendent, Carcharodon hubbelli. The behavioral adaptation to mammalophagy in the Carcharodon lineage, regardless as to how inefficient it might have been without serrated teeth, appears to have occurred for millions of years prior to the evolution of fully serrated teeth in Carcharodon carcharias. That feeding behavior may well have given natural selection sufficient time to develop and hone the serrated teeth now seen in extant great white sharks (C. carcharias). Given that competition for high trophic resources between the Carcharodon and Otodus lineages seemingly existed for millions of years prior to the extinction of Otodus megalodon, it seems that competition alone is likely not the only explanation for why O. megalodon went extinct.",

Turiasaurians have not previously been described from the El Mers III Formation, and the only named sauropod from the El Mers Group, which lacks preserved teeth, is the dubious taxon “Cetiosaurus mogrebiensis”. Due to lack of overlapping material and its lack of clear diagnostic characters, we refrain from referring these teeth to the latter, and identify them as Turiasauria indeterminate instead. These teeth represent the first definitive turiasaurian remains from Morocco, as well as the geologically oldest occurrence of Turiasauria from mainland Africa.",

    "abstract": "The shells of muricoid gastropod Ecphora gardnerae from the Miocene St. Marys Formation of Maryland, USA, have been shown to contain polymeric sheets within the calcareous matrix. These membranes were found to have amino acids and complex sugar compounds. To explore these biomolecular features further, four new E. gardnerae shells were collected and analyzed for proteins and sugar compounds. Using direct analysis in real time (DART) mass spectrometry, we were able to show that the membranes contain chitin. With mass spectrometry-based paleoproteomic techniques utilizing a hydroxylamine extraction or sample preparation by easy extraction and digestion (SPEED), we found preserved peptides from all four shells including peptides that are specific to Gastropoda or Mollusca. The membranes derive from the calcitic layer of the shell and are likely analogous to chitin membranes used by other extant mollusks to control nucleation, growth, and physical properties in the calcareous layers, but future research in gastropod biology will help to address the function of these membranes.",

    "abstract": "Muscle scars, embryonic shell, colour pattern and intraspecific variation are known together in a very limited numberof straight shelled cephalopods, leading to uncertainty in the classification of the subclass Orthoceratoidea. Thenewly described genus Lepidoceras from the Silurian of Bohemia, interpreted as a demersal orthoceratid similar to Kionoceras, shows all relevant diagnostic characters. The earliest late Wenlock populations of Lepidoceras have aweakly curved endogastric shell, but the shell becomes increasingly more curved throughout the Ludlow. The sculptureis characterized by distinctive longitudinal lirae or ridges, the number of which is variable and maintained duringontogeny. The embryonic shell of Lepidoceras is one of the largest in orthoceratids; it is conical or weakly curved inshape beginning with a smooth non-accretion initial shell. Hatching is manifested by growth walls in some specimens;hatchlings were apparently demersal. Adults are usually characterized by mature modifications of the shell: septalcrowding and shell wall thickening. A high proportion of adult specimens indicates low mortality in palaeopopulations.Healed repairs indicate a lower predation pressure, which decreases after the juvenile stage. Extensive shell repair injuveniles demonstrates high regenerative capacity. Orthoceratomorph muscle scars found only in adults show a pairof dorsal retractor imprints that gradually expanded laterally. The colour pattern consists of irregular transverse bands,which have never been detected in orthoceratids before. The pattern, which is similar to that in curved oncocerids, isprobably an expression of adaptive convergence of this feature in both groups. Shell pathologies, which have beenobserved in juvenile orthoceratids for the first time, are rare; an extensive pathology in a mature specimen illustrateslimit of survival in orthoceratids. Lepidoceras is an example of a demersal orthoceratid entering a niche inhabitedpredominantly by multiceratoids.",

The European record is comparatively sparse, with Pelecanimimus from the Lower Cretaceous of Spain being the only unequivocal representative. Here, we present a manual ungual and a distal metatarsal III from a Lower Cretaceous (Barremian to Aptian) karstic fissure fill in Balve, northwestern Germany, which we assign to Ornithomimosauria indet. We also review the literature regarding manual unguals of ornithomimosaurs and confirm previous reports of quite consistent positional variation within Ornithomimosauria, with manual ungual I being the most recurved and bearing the largest flexor tubercle, and the unguals of digits II and III being less recurved and possessing smaller tubercles. The manual ungual from Balve is closest in morphology to manual digit III. The metatarsal has a shaft with a strongly triangular cross-section, marking it as a sub- or fully developed arctometatarsal. This type of specialized third metatarsal occurs in a number of different clades of Coelurosauria (Alvarezsauroidea, Ornithomimosauria, Oviraptorosauria, Troodontidae, Tyrannosauridae). Based on its overall morphology and the rarity (Alvarezsauroidea, Troodontidae) or absence (Oviraptorosauria, Tyrannosauridae) of other clades with arctometatarsals from the fossil record of Europe, we regard it as ornithomimosaurian. This is only the second definitive record of European ornithomimosaurs, after the description of Pelecanimimus polyodon from Spain, and represents the first reported occurrence of this clade in Germany.",

While the trace fossils associated with their boring behavior (Teredolites and Apectoichnus) are well documented, their body fossils are much rarer in the fossil record, particularly as amber inclusions. This work reports inclusions of fossilized piddocks and the first known barnacle inclusions from the Early Miocene simojovelite (Chiapas amber). We examined seven amber specimens containing over 90 piddock inclusions, representing at least five distinct morphotypes. The amber preserved various developmental stages, from juveniles with open pedal gaps to fully mature individuals with well-developed accessory plates. Taphonomic analysis, observed orientations, and the presence of diagenetically altered inclusions suggest that these piddocks inhabited waterlogged wood of Hymenaea and possibly semi-hardened resin before entrapment. This study highlights fossil resins as an overlooked preservational medium for marine invertebrates, providing new data on piddock behavior, fossil resin taphonomy, and the Miocene coastal environments of the Chiapas region.",

We investigate the evolutionary impacts of long-term climate change by analysing the dynamics of Cenozoic mammal evolution, looking for the presence of state transitions, stable equilibrium states and their association with long-term climate evolution. We perform Bayesian modelling of Artiodactyla, Carnivora, and Perissodactyla evolutionary histories. We then use recurrence plot analysis of the species richness time series, identifying the main transitions and regimes in large mammal evolution. Joint recurrence plots of diversity-Cenozoic oxygen isotope record as well as recurrence quantification analysis are used to further investigate the coupled dynamics of climate and mammal evolution. We find that several transitions between different states of the long-term climate evolution correspond to subsequent transitions and multistable states of diversity. The evidence for several climate transitions is recovered from joint recurrence states of diversity time series alone, indicating coordinated behaviour of three different mammalian orders and climate. The diversity fluctuations increase in amplitude during the Coolhouse regime in Oligocene and Miocene, with the diversity evolution starting an unprecedented decline during the Icehouse. Our results suggest that mammal diversity evolution has been coupled with the dynamical state of paleoclimate on multi-million-year timescales.",

The taxon is known from a single, nearly complete and slightly dissociated skeleton which was made the paratype of the putative oilbird Prefica nivea Olson, 1987 (Steatornithidae, Caprimulgiformes). Apart from the greatly abbreviated tarsometatarsus, Fluvioviridavis especially corresponds to recent oilbirds in the unusually wide proximal end of the humerus. However, in other features, e.g., the shape of its much longer beak, the Eocene taxon is clearly distinguished from the recent oilbird (Steatornis). In contrast, Prefica nivea agrees with Steatornis in the shape of the mandible but differs in the much narrower proximal end of the humerus. At present, no derived character convincingly supports a classification of F. platyrhamphus into any of the higher avian taxa. The species is here classified �order and family incertae sedis�. An isolated skull from the Middle Eocene of Messel (Hessen, Germany) is tentatively assigned to ?Fluvioviridavis sp., and associated bones from the Lower Eocene London Clay of Walton-on-the-Naze (Essex, England) might also be related to the genus Fluvioviridavis.",

Diversity of shallow−water rugose corals gradually increased during the Frasnian, but ended with sudden extinction near the end of Frasnian. Ostracods were abundant during the Frasnian; their extinction coincided with anoxic deposition of the end−Frasnian black shale deposits. The early Famennian ostracod fauna is of low diversity. The brachiopod fauna of the late Frasnian (Palmatolepis rhenana and Pa. linguiformis zones) is dominated by atrypids, small−sized cyrtospiriferids, and the rhynchonellid Hunanotoechia. All atrypids disappeared before the F–F boundary with highest rates of extinction below the boundary (probably low in the Pa. linguiformis Zone). The Frasnian cyrtospiriferid fauna is also of low diversity and dominated by small taxa. All but one of the cyrtospiriferid taxa crossed the F–F boundary. The early Famennian post−extinction recovery brachiopod fauna was the result of rapid radiation of new forms shortly after the terminal Frasnian event. The early Famennian fauna is characterized by diverse cyrto− spiriferids, abundant Yunnanellina and productoids. Above the early recovery fauna another fauna was recovered, with brachiopods Hunanospirifer and Yunnanella and is correlated with the late or latest Pa. crepida Zone.

A focal point of this study was to determine whether morphological trends in Mammuthus molars were accompanied by correlated enamel microstructure changes. In the examined four taxa the enamel of the cheek teeth consists of three layers delimited by two major discontinuities in enamel prism direction. Noticeably, the enamel capping the occlusal end of the unworn molar plates retains a less derived two−layered structure, similar to that found in the basal proboscidean Moeritherium. In Mammuthus meridionalis the third deciduous premolar is differentiated from all other teeth in having more strongly decussating Hunter−Schreger bands in the middle layer, as a possible reinforcement of the very thin enamel. Evidence from this analysis shows that, in the transition from late Middle Pliocene M. rumanus to Late Pleistocene M. primigenius, the middle enamel layer, which is made up of prisms at an angle to the occlusal surface, pro− viding greater resistance against wear, increased its relative thickness. This is consistent with the hypothesis that Mammuthus adapted to a more abrasive diet. Comparison with other proboscidean taxa indicates that the schmelzmuster (enamel pattern) found in Mammuthus is a synapomorphy of the Elephantoidea.",

The scolecodonts described herein have important evolutionary and distribution implications for polychaetes: the order Eunicida shows a richer diversification in the Permian than previously known; the family Paulinitidae survived at least until the Late Permian; the family Hartmaniellidae diversified already in the late Palaeozoic; some forms are considered as representatives of unknown species and genera; the order Phyllodocida originated already in the latest Palaeozoic.",

    "abstract": "Paranyctoides is represented by three named, and possibly four unnamed species in the Late Cretaceous, North America. P. aralensis from the Late Cretaceous of Dzharakuduk, Uzbekistan, belongs in this or a closely allied taxon. Lower molars have low trigonids, well−developed paraconids not appressed against metaconids, talonids on m1–2 as wide or wider than trigonids, hypoconulids often closer to entoconids than to hypoconids. Only two upper molars are known, both have comparatively narrow crowns with wide stylar shelves and stylar cusps, paracone and metacone separated, conules well developed, and protocone low. Pre− and postcingula vary from narrow in one, Sailestes quadrans, to wide in the other, Paranyctoides sp. Sailestes quadrans may be an metatherian. All known spe− cies of Paranyctoides from North America have a submolariform ultimate premolar while Gallolestes pachymandibularis, also from North America, has molars not unlike those in Paranyctoides but may have an ultimate premolar with a molariform trigonid. A specimen from Dzharakuduk referable to P. aralensis is suggestive of such morphology. At least P. aralensis had five premolars with the third reduced as in ‘zhelestids’. These findings in− crease the Late Cretaceous North American/Asian ties even more for eutherians, now with ‘zhelestids’ and the Paranyctoides/Gallolestes clades known from both.",

    "abstract": "The scapulocoracoid of Czatkobatrachus polonicus Evans and Borsuk-Bialynicka, 1998, a stem-frog from the Early Triassic karst locality of Czatkowice (Southern Poland), is described. The overall type of scapulocoracoid is plesiomorphic, but the subcircular shape and laterally oriented glenoid is considered synapomorphic of Salientia. The supraglenoid foramen is considered homologous to the scapular cleft of the Anura. In Czatkobatrachus, the supraglenoid foramen occupies an intermediate position between that of the early tetrapod foramen and the scapular cleft of Anura. The cleft scapula is probably synapomorphic for the Anura. In early salientian phylogeny, the shift in position of the supraglenoid foramen may have been associated with an anterior rotation of the forelimb. This change in position of the forelimb may reflect an evolutionary shift from a mainly locomotory function to static functions (support, balance, eventually shock-absorption). Laterally extended limbs may have been more effective than posterolateral ones in absorbing landing stresses, until the specialised shock-absorption pectoral mechanism of crown-group Anura had developed. The glenoid shape and position, and the slender scapular blade, of Czatkobatrachus, in combination with the well-ossified joint surfaces on the humerus and ulna, all support a primarily terrestrial rather than aquatic mode of life. The new Polish material also permits clarification of the pectoral anatomy of the contemporaneous Madagascan genus Triadobatrachus.",

Such structures have never been observed before either in the Recent or fossil Rhabdopleurida. However, both in their origin and in their relations to the stolon and to the zooidal tube, diaphragm complexes strongly resemble the internal portions of thecae as recognized in the sessile orders of the Graptolithina.

Three more skulls from Hermiin Tsav are now available, associ− ated with parts of the previously unknown postcranial skeleton, which will be described separately. We describe herein the skull and dentition of C. catopsaloides, based on all available material, housed in PIN, PM, and ZPAL collections. The genera Catopsbaatar, Djadochtatherium, and Kryptobaatar share several characters, unknown in Tombaatar, such as very long postorbital processes directed postero−laterally and downwards, parietal ridges extending from the posterior margins of the postorbital processes postero−medially, and nuchal crests with prominent lateral wings, incurved anteri− orly in the middle, so that the skull in dorsal view is shorter in the middle than laterally. Catopsbaatar shares with Djadochtatherium a very high and prominent anterior zygomatic ridge, and presence of the masseteric protuberance, but differs from it and from other djadochtatherioid genera in having the orbit situated more posteriorly, the intermediate zygomatic ridge adhering to the anterior ridge, and a smaller trapezoidal (rather than crescent−shaped) p4 without ridges; it differs from Kryptobaatar and Djadochtatherium in having three upper premolars (P2 being lost) and shares this last character with Tombaatar. Catopsbaatar is known not only from Hermiin Tsav, but also from Baruungoyot Formation of Khulsan, represented there by a single m2. We demonstrate that the separation of the masseter superficialis into two parts, the origins of which leave scars on the lateral wall of the zygomatic arch surrounded by zygomatic ridges, occurs in all the multituberculates (beginning with Paulchoffatiidae), and is regarded as a multituberculate autapomorphy.",

This paper presents a detailed description of the basicranium of an undistorted partial skull of Quercygale. The new data form the basis for a phylogenetic analysis of Quercygale in the context of basal carnivoramorphan interrelationships. Quercygale has a mix of derived and plesiomorphic characters. The promontorium is highly derived, and unlike that of any other “miacoid”. Yet, based on the evidence from surrounding bones the bulla does not appear to be as expanded as in other closely related miacids. In the phylogenetic analysis Quercygale is the sister−taxon to Nimravidae and crown−group Carnivora, and it appears to be the most derived of the stem−group Miacidae. We discuss the implications that the position of Quercygale has on carnivoramorphan phylogenetics.",

Initially the teeth of P. sternbergi were described as smooth and blade−like, but recent discoveries of new specimens from the type locality and re−examination of the original material in− dicate that the chisel−like teeth of P. sternbergi have small, irregular serrations along the blades. These serrations are simi− lar in size to those found on the teeth of the modern herbivorous lizard Iguana iguana and were likely used in a similar manner to crop vegetation, but was also capable of a degree of oral food processing due to the transverse orientation and interlocking arrangement of the dentition of P. sternbergi. Additionally, the presence of transversely oriented teeth with V−shaped blades in the anterior portion of the tooth row of P. sternbergi represents an additional shared characteristic in tooth structure between P. sternbergi and Dicothodon moorensis, Bicuspidon numerosus, and Peneteius aquilonoius; all transversely−tooth polyglyphandontine lizards from the Cretaceous of North America. It appears that the unique dentitions of Polyglyphanodon sternbergi (large teeth with transverse, serrated blades) and Peneteius aquilonius (small teeth with mammal−like specializations) present by the end of the Cretaceous were derived from a bicuspid, transversely oriented precursor tooth with a V−shaped blade.",

    "abstract": "Georges Cuvier (1798) established the classical concept of Edentata which included sloths, anteaters, armadillos, aard− varks, and pangolins. With the growing body of comparative morphological data becoming available during the nine− teenth century, it was evident that Cuvier's “Edentata” was an artificial group (e.g., Huxley 1872). In his classical text− book, Weber (1904) excluded aardvarks and pangolins from the Edentata and put them in separate orders, Tubulidentata and Pholidota. Later on, fossil taxa were repeatedly added to and removed from Edentata, such as various xenarthran groups, taeniodonts, palaeanodonts, and gondwanatheres, but the South American Xenarthra always was considered as their core group. Even the living order Pholidota has been cited again as ?Edentata incertae sedis many years after Weber’s work (Romer 1966). The validity and extent of a higher taxon Edentata are still in dispute. In this discussion, the Middle Eocene pholidotan Eomanis and the putative xenarthran Eurotamandua from Grube Messel near Darm− stadt (Germany) play an important role (Storch 1978, 1981, 2003; Rose and Emry 1993; Gaudin and Branham 1998; Rose 1999). Eomanis krebsi and Eurotamandua joresi have been subject to some discussion regarding their taxonomic distinction. It has been suggested that the only specimen known of Eo. krebsi might actually be a juvenile representa− tive of the senior species E. joresi. A reexamination of the type specimen of Eo. krebsi has yielded some new observa− tions regarding the identity of some of its ankle elements. An element that was previously identified as a navicular, is here reidentified as a partial distal tibia, whereas a partially ex− posed calcaneus had gone unnoticed. These two elements dis− play several differences in morphology between Eo. krebsi and E. joresi, indicating that these are in fact distinct species.",

Frequency of the conodont elements has been controlled mostly by depositional rate in hemipelagic muddy lithofacies and post-mortem gravity sorting during lateral redeposition in storm-generated, talus-like and encrinite layers. The conodont assemblages are dominated by a highly varying proportion of polygnathid, icriodontid, and ancyrodellid fauna. Major biofacies turnovers coincided with the deepening pulses corresponding to Timan, Middlesex, and early Rhinestreet global events. Trends in the conodont dynamics, mortality, and diversity point that the biotic shifts also coincide with the large-scale 13C excursions as a record of changing trophic conditions during the major biogeochemical perturbation. A gradual decline of the Early Frasnian Ancyrodella reef-dwelling community correlates with the minor positive and succeeding larger negative 13C excursion, and this is paired with a replacement by mostly sparse, polygnathid and polygnathid-icriodontid biofacies, as well as with a short-term Belodella acme in mud-mounds areas. The distinctive habitat deterioration in pelagic and reef ecosystems is broadly correlative with the Domanik Crisis. The progressive biofacies unification is a conodont response to onset of the prolonged (ca. 0.5 Ma) 13C enrichment, probably linked with high-stress life conditions due to eutrophication and partly anoxic regimes. A negative carbon isotope excursion in the late Pamatolepis punctata Zone is marked by the second major biofacies turning point during the Rhinestreet transgression, as recorded primarily in a final mesotaxid extinction, and highlighted also by decrease of conodont size and increased mortality of juveniles. After stabilization of 13C values and a return to the background level across the Palmatolepis punctata-Palmatolepis hassi zonal transition, renewed biofacies diversification, in particular re-appearance of reef-related ancyrodellid fauna, took place. In addition, a large-scale migration event among palmatolepids and polygnathids during sea-level rise, mainly from the East European Platform, characterized this Middle Frasnian interval.",

The Kawauchi Formation of Hikoroichi corresponds to G, and a part of G,. The Okuhinotsuchi Formation of Arisu is mainly correlatable with the G,. The Ohno fauna of Hikoroichi with Xystrtphyttum and the FUkuji fauna are both Early Devonian in age, but their composition is quite different from each other. The Nakazato fauna of Hikoroichi is Middle Devonian. These faunas are composed mostly of cosmopolitan genera.

The key proceeds by presenting a number of contrasted statements each of which leads to a further set of alternative and eventually to a specific identification.

Specimens of Urasterella? sp. and Cnemidactis sp. are recognized from the Middle Ordovician of northwest Russia; although similar to known species, incomplete preservation precludes more precise tax− onomic assessment. Asteroids are important in many existing marine communities, and in spite of a meager fossil record, diversity suggests they were important in the early Paleozoic as well. Some debate has centered on arm flexibility in early asteroids, which bears on their roles in their communities. Parallels in ambulacral series arrangement between Ordovician and extant species and presence of an ambulacral furrow indicate similar broad ranges of motion and therefore potentially parallel ecologic roles. Many factors might have contributed to the differences between ancient and extant ambulacral ar− ticulation, including changes in positioning of a part of the water vascular system, changes in predation and bioturbation pressures, and taphonomic events that obscure skeletal details.",

The holotype specimen of P. eunjooae sp. nov. for the first time allows a detailed examination of the distal tarsometatarsus in one of the Messel zygodactylids. It also exhibits exceptionally well-preserved tail feathers which, most notably, are formed by a long central pair of rectrices. We further report on a new specimen of Primozygodactylus major, which is the largest zygodactylid from Messel. Being one of the few dissociated skeletons of Primozygodactylus, the new specimen shows some previously unknown osteological features of this taxon and allows a more detailed comparison with other zygodactylids.",

    "abstract": "Fossil capybaras are morphologically extremely varied, but previous studies have disagreed on whether this diversity reflects intraspecific variation or the existence of multiple species.Here, we review the capybaras from the classic Argentinian Late Miocene localities of Paraná River cliffs (\"conglomerado osífero\" of the Ituzaingó Formation, Entre Ríos), and Chillhué and Guatraché shallow lakes (Cerro Azul Formation, La Pampa), and perform a morphometric analysis of their upper cheek teeth and the posterior portion of the rostrum.Our results confirm that all of the specimens from the \"conglomerado osífero\" belong to the single species Cardiatherium paranense.In addition, we refer a specimen from Tupungato (Río de los Pozos Formation, Mendoza) to C. paranense, thus expanding its geographical range.The material from La Pampa represents a different taxon, and is here preliminary referred to Cardiatherium aff.orientalis.Our systematic interpretation of Late Miocene capybaras suggests that the early radiation of this group was not as explosive as previously thought, and was likely constrained by the early acquisition of large size, increasing complexity of the cheek teeth, and probably semi-aquatic habits.",

    "abstract": "Spermophilus is the most diverse and abundant genus of Eurasian sciurids.Even though many species have been described, the early evolution of the group is poorly understood.Here we present a review of the evolution and taxonomy of early Spermophilus, based on analysis of more than 1500 specimens from the late Pliocene and Early-Middle Pleistocene of Ukraine and European Russia, representing the most complete and continuous fossil record of the early Old World ground squirrels known to date.In addition to documenting previously unpublished specimens of Spermophilus nogaici, we describe a new species, Spermophilus praecox sp.nov., the oldest member of the genus, from the late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene (middle Villanyian to earliest Biharian) of southern Ukraine.It is intermediate in size between a somewhat smaller Spermophilus nogaici and larger Spermophilus polonicus and Spermophilus primigenius.Morphologically, the new species can be distinguished from all known Spermophilus by the retention of primitive traits including a small P3; rudimentary lingual metaloph; large metaconule and mesostyle; presence of P4-M2 endoloph; and premolariform p4 lacking a lingual metalophid.The patterns of dental evolution in eastern European early Spermophilus throughout 2.15 My indicates the existence of a single gradually evolving S. praecox-S.nogaici lineage characterized by a decrease of molar size but enlargement of premolars; the tendency toward high-crowned teeth with more expanded anterior and reduced posterior lobes; well-developed transverse ridges and anterostyles; reduced endolophs, anteroconules, metaconules, and mesostyles of P4-M2; molariform p4; complete m1-m2 metalophids; and stronger m3 hypoconid, hypoconulid, and entoconulid.Dental character regression suggests that Spermophilus evolved from a relatively largesized sciurid having generalized Otospermophilus-like dentition, probably an unknown North American member of stem Marmotina.",

    "abstract": "A specialized diving lifestyle has repeatedly evolved in several lineages of modern and fossil waterfowl (Anseriformes), with the oldest previously known representative being the late Oligocene Australian oxyurine ducks Pinpanetta.However, diving specializations have never been previously documented for any of the primitive Paleogene anseriforms ( \"stem-anatids\"), and thus may be associated with the origin of modern anatid-like body plan.Here I describe a tarsometatarsus of a new duck-sized diving anseriform bird from the latest Eocene (late Priabonian) Kusto Svita in Eastern Kazakhstan, which predates the previously reported occurrence of diving specialization in Anseriformes by at least 6 MA.The new taxon Cousteauvia kustovia gen.et sp.nov.has an unusual and previously undocumented morphology, but partly resembles the stem-anatids Paranyrocidae and Romainvilliidae, thus representing the first known occurrence of diving adaptations in primitive non-anatid anseriforms.The evolutionary appearance of specialized waterfowl taxa in the late Eocene of Central Asia supports a view that this region might have played an important role in the evolution of morphologically derived Anseriformes.The structure of the intertarsal joint in basal and modern anseriforms is here further discussed in relation with adaptations for aquatic locomotion.The presence of elongate and evenly narrow condyles of the tibiotarsus in Anatidae and other swimming/diving birds allows a firm contact with the hyperprotracted tarsometatarsus at the initial phase of the propulsion.This morphology contrasts with the restricted condyles of Presbyornithidae, which indicate a different, strictly wading locomotory specialization.Cousteauvia obviously evolved diving specializations on the basis of a more primitive structure of the intertarsal joint.",

Dimorphic pairs have been demonstrated as new in the Štramberk material for the pairs Haploceras staszycii (microconch, m) and Haploceras elimatum (macroconch, M), as well as Hypolissoceras carachtheis (m) and Hypolissoceras woehleri (M).

    "abstract": "Compared to other ocean basins there are few reported Recent methane seep communities from the Indian Ocean, with records from offshore Indonesia and Pakistan, and, more recently the east coast of India, in the Krishna-Godavari and Mannar Basins in bathyal water depths. Also from the former area, Upper Pleistocene aged fossil methane seep assemblages have been recovered from sediment cores. Here we describe systematically bivalves, gastropods and scaphopods from a methane seep assemblage penetrated by two sediment cores, drilled in 1045 m and 1050 m water depth, at horizons dated to between 40 and 52 kyrBP. The fossil molluscs comprise 29 taxa: 15 gastropods, 12 bivalves and two scaphopods. Of these, nine are new species: six gastropods (Paralepetopsis bathyalus Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov., Mesopelex godavariensis Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov., Anatoma sahlingi Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov., Cirsonella aperta Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov., Dikoleps? magnarota Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov., and Alvania axistriata Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov.) and three bivalves (Ledella favus Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov., Yoldiella umbostriata Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov., and Vesicomya prashadi Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov.). Six of the molluscan taxa likely had chemosymbionts: (Acharax sp., Gigantidas cf. platifrons, Conchocele sp., Pliocardia cf. solidissima, Callogonia cf. leeana, and Archivesica cf. kawamurai), representing 21% of the diversity in the seep assemblage. Apart from Acharax sp., all these putative chemosymbiotic taxa were likely obligate to seeps, as was probably the case for Paralepetopsis bathyalus Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov. and Anatoma sahlingi Hoffman &amp; Little sp. nov. The other bivalve, gastropod and scaphopod species in the assemblage have living relatives common in bathyal habitats and can thus be considered as facultative or ‘background’ fauna. The fossil seep assemblage shares some taxa with recent seep communities in the east coast of India and elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, although additional systematic work is needed on the living taxa for a full comparison to be made.",

The specimen is the first definitive pan-trionychid record from the Upper Cretaceous of southern China. Its general skeletal features are comparable with those of other pan-trionychids from the mid Cretaceous of Asia.

    "abstract": "Astrapotheres (Astrapotheria) are an order of South American native ungulates (SANUs), and the geologically youngest astrapotheres belong to the subfamily Uruguaytheriinae (Astrapotheriidae). In this study, we: (i) analyze uruguaytheriine remains from the late Middle Miocene Quebrada Honda Basin (QHB) of southern Bolivia; and (ii) discuss paleoecology of Bolivian astrapotheres based on new dental mesowear angle data and enamel stable carbon isotope (δ13C) data from these and other specimens. New material consists of a partial left maxilla preserving DP2–3 and an associated deciduous lower incisor. Two newly described specimens include a mostly complete m3 and a partial palate preserving left and right DP2–4. The QHB deciduous premolars are the first described for a uruguaytheriine and among the few described for astrapotheres. We conclude that the QHB specimens represent a new but unnamed species that likely does not pertain to any presently recognized genus. It differs from other uruguaytheriines in its intermediate size, relatively high-crowned teeth, presence of a lingually open M3 central valley, and absence of m3 hypoflexid, among other features. Astrapothere mesowear angle data from the QHB and slightly older Bolivian sites (Cerdas and Nazareno) suggest that Middle Miocene astrapotheres were browsers, perhaps resembling the extant black rhino (Diceros bicornis). New and updated enamel stable carbon isotope data suggest that QHB astrapotheres and toxodontid notoungulates fed on isotopically similar vegetation slightly more enriched (~1‰) than vegetation consumed by proterotheriid litopterns (Olisanophus spp.) and the notoungulate Hemihegetotherium trilobus. These data support paleopedology- and paleoichnology-based habitat reconstructions for the QHB that suggest it was more densely vegetated than Cerdas. Relatively enriched δ13C samples (&gt; -7.0‰) from Cerdas and Quehua (Late Miocene) suggest that some Bolivian notoungulates were grazing on C4 vegetation, which casts doubt on the proposal that the southern Central Andean Plateau experienced significant uplift prior to ~9 Ma.",

Here, we provide the first description of an eggshell found in the Lance Formation in eastern Wyoming. The eggshell can be attributed to the oofamily Ovaloolithidae, and is most comparable to the oogenus Ovaloolithus based on the smooth outer surface, the eggshell thickness, the closely packed shell units, and the presence of two layers. The eggshell can tentatively be ascribed to either ornithopod or non-avian theropod dinosaurs. This new eggshell expands our understanding of the geographical distribution of ovaloolithid ootaxa throughout the uppermost Cretaceous of North America, having been previously described from the Maastrichtian North Horn Formation of Utah.",

Dollocaris toarcica sp. nov. is the third described species of its genus, previously known from the Middle Jurassic (Callovian) of France and Upper Jurassic (Tithonian) of Germany, expanding the stratigraphic span of the genus to the Lower Jurassic. The newly described genus Zazrivacaris shows morphological similarities with Mayrocaris, yet another genus known from the Upper Jurassic (Tithonian) of Germany. Considering current knowledge, we present a review of all known micro- and macro-structural patterns present on thylacocephalan shields.

The sinuous double-row dentition of Pleurodontagama aenigmatodes, the Late Cretaceous Mongolian relative of the Acrodonta is a possible initial stage of evolution of tooth permanency in the Acrodonta. The reconstructed ontogenetic development of this dentition is considered as a model of evolutionary events that resulted in tooth permanency. The acceleration of the posteriad growth of jaws, that occurred at the origin of the Acrodonta, was probably followed by both peripheral and interstitial growth of the dental lamina. Created by the interstitial growth, the interdental spaces were not large enough to allow for the inclusion of the subsequently developed teeth into the main (labial) tooth row. Their blockage resulted in the eventual total blockage of tooth replacement. The requirements of the precise occlusion resulted in a reduction of the redundant lingual tooth row of the Pleurodontagama type. The dentition subsequently changed into a one-row permanent type increasing by a sequential addition of teeth. The patterns of dentition in the sphenodontidans and the varanoids may also result from evolutionary changes of skull proportions via the differential growth of jaws and consequent adjustment of the dental lamina.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of locomotory speeds of small to large-sized Patagonian dinosaurs are presented for the first time. These estimates are inferred from trackways found on fine to coarse-grained brown sandstones located in the lower section of the Candeleros Member of the Rio Limay Formation (Albian-Cenomanian), Neuquen Province, Argentina. The method used is based on the measurement of the stride length (distance between two successive prints of the same foot) and of the length of the hindfoot print, which in turn, allows us to estimate the height at the hip joint and, therefore, the approximate size of the animal. The hypothesis of dynamic similarity implies that the movements of geometrically similar animals, although of different sizes, are dynamically similar only when they move with the same Froude number. The dynamically similar movements (i.e., those with equal Froude number) require equal values of relative stride length (ratio between the stride length and the hip joint height). The relationship between the relative stride length and the Froude number allows us to estimate the speeds of dinosaurs. The dinosaurian ichnofauna studied reveals low speeds that range from 0.5 to 2.6 m s-1. Our analyses show that the sauropods responsible for these trackways were either walking very slowly in a bipedal stance or alternatively they were progressing quadrupedally on a slippery surface.",

Hence the current practice of labeling the teeth as the first through fifth and the first through fourth, depending on how many teeth are observed in the jaw, results in incorrect implied homologies for the last two premolars of the series. Given the long-standing tradition of referring to the premolars as the first through fourth, for most eutherian groups, together with the uncertainties involved in interpreting the difference, the most practical solution is to refer to the disputed tooth by a neutral term, 'Px', as advocated several decades ago.",

The fossil darter Macranhingaparanensis (Aves: Pelecaniformes) from the late Miocene of Argentina is the largest of all known extinct or living Anhingidae. Its body mass is esti- mated at a mean value of 5.4 kg by using a scaling model derived from the logarithmic re- lationship between measurements of the least shaft circumference of the femur1 tibio- tarsus and body masses. Predictions of body mass, as well as the analysis of anatomical evidence, are used to infer that Macranhinga paranensis would have probably had a powered flapping flight and an aquatic locomotion similar to that of cormorants. The morphology of the pelvis and the hind-limb would have allowed Macranhinga para- nensis to catch fishes by means of pursuit-diving rather than stalking them in an anhin- ga-like manner. As determined by adaptations mainly of tarsometatarsal morphology, the species had well developed perching and climbing abilities.

The early Mesozoic karst infillings within the Lower Carboniferous limestone of the locality Czatkowice 1 (Southern Poland) containing a diverse terrestrial microvertebrate assemblage (see Borsuk−Bialynicka et al. 1999 for review) were origi− nally thought to be most likely Late Permian to Early Trias− sic in age. Subsequent study of the assemblage containing procolophonids, prolacertiforms, basal lepidosauromorphs, a basal archosaur and small amphibians (including a pre−frog) showed that it is Early Triassic, most probably Late Olenekian, in age because of the advanced dentition pattern of the procolophonids. The discovery of tooth plates of the lungfish Gnathorhiza, known to range from the Induan into early Late Olenekian (Vetlugian Superhorizon to Fedorovskian Horizon of the regional scheme) in Eastern Europe, has further enhanced the dating. The combination of procolophonid and dipnoan evidence now appears to re− strict the age of the Czatkowice 1 assemblage to the Early Olenekian.",

The dorsal shell wall consists of the outer and inner components which were deposited sequentially, beginning at the aperture of the living chamber inwards. The dorsal wall attains its full thickness near the last septum. The outer component is visible in the apertural region and is smooth or wrinkled; it is called the wrinkled layer in the latter case. The wrinkles may be continuous, interrupted, or form isolated patches arranged in rows. The wrinkles are usually triangular in cross section. A further stage of dorsal wall development involves filling in the space between the apices of triangles, and then adding one or more inner prismatic layers from the inside of the living chamber. This pattern occurs at least in the postembryonic stage of all genera studied, belonging to five suborders of Ammonoidea ranging from Late Carboniferous to Late Cretaceous. In many genera, the outer component of the dorsal shell wall exhibits remarkable ontogenetic change in its ultrastructure and micro-ornament. It may be compared with the black film of Recent Nautilus shells with respect to place of formation. The outer component of the ammonoid dorsal shell wall is regarded as a product of organic secretion and carbonate precipitation in the area of the supracephalic mantle fold.",

    "abstract": "Larval and earliest postlarval shells of Jurassic Bakevelliidae are described for the first time and some complementary data are given concerning larval shells of oysters and pinnids. Two new larval shell characters, a posterodorsal outlet and shell septum are described. The outlet is homologous to the posterodorsal notch of oysters and posterodorsal ridge of arcoids. It probably reflects the presence of the soft anatomical character post−anal tuft, which, among Pteriomorphia, was only known from oysters. A shell septum was so far only known from Cassianellidae, Lithiotidae, and the bakevelliid Kobayashites. A review of early ontogenetic shell characters strongly suggests a basal dichotomy within the Pterio− morphia separating taxa with opisthogyrate larval shells, such as most (or all?) Praecardioida, Pinnoida, Pterioida (Bakevelliidae, Cassianellidae, all living Pterioidea), and Ostreoida from all other groups. The Pinnidae appear to be closely related to the Pterioida, and the Bakevelliidae belong to the stem line of the Cassianellidae, Lithiotidae, Pterioidea, and Ostreoidea. The latter two superfamilies comprise a well constrained clade. These interpretations are con− sistent with recent phylogenetic hypotheses based on palaeontological and genetic (18S and 28S mtDNA) data. A more detailed phylogeny is hampered by the fact that many larval shell characters are rather ancient plesiomorphies.",

The sense of coiling of the scaphopod protoconch is opposite to that of Pinnocaris. Scaphopod protoconchs resemble helcionelloid molluscs (Cambrian–Early Ordovician) in terms of their direction of coiling, although the scaphopod shell is strongly modified by the extreme anterior component of growth. Convergence is identified between scaphopods and two helcionelloid lineages (Eotebenna and Yochelcionella) from the Early–Middle Cambrian. The large stratigraphical gap between helcionelloids and the first undoubted scaphopods (Devonian or Car− boniferous) supports the notion that the scaphopods were derived from conocardioid rostroconchs rather than directly from helcionelloids. However, the protoconch of conocardioid rostroconchs closely resembles the helcionelloid shell, suggesting that conocardioids in turn were probably derived from helcionelloids.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to dramatic losses of the Atrypida and Pentamerida at the Frasnian–Famennian boundary, the Rhynchonellida demonstrated relatively high rate of survival, and recolonized vacated benthic ecospace after the F–F extinction events. The Late Devonian evolution of rhynchonellid faunas from the East European Platform shows three distinctive periods of their mass appearance. High abundance of rhynchonellids is characteristic for early–middle Frasnian (Palmatolepis transitans–Pa. punctata zones) and early Famennian (Pa. crepida Zone). Invasion of taxonomically diverse and rich rhynchonellid faunas usually corresponds to the major transgressive episodes, whereas decline coincides with regressive conditions of the basin. Rhynchonellid assemblages were replaced in the late Frasnian (Late Pa. hassi–Pa. linguiformis zones) by theodossiid− and cyrtospiriferid− dominated assemblages, which occupied habitats in newly expanding marine environments. The extinction of theodossiids at the end of the Frasnian and the next transgressive episode possibly stimu− lated an expansion of rhynchonellids. The early Frasnian species Ripidiorhynchus livonicus (Buch, 1834), and the early Famennian R. huotinus (Verneuil, 1845) and R. griasicus (Nalivkin, 1934) are revised. Early Famennian species Paromoeopygma koscharica (Nalivkin, 1934) from the central region is redescribed. Ripidiorhynchus chencinensis sp. nov. from the latest Givetian of Poland, as well as Globulirhynchia minima sp. nov. from the late Frasnian of the central region of the Russia, are described.",

The Late Carboniferous amphibian genus Limnerpeton Fritsch, 1881 is revised on the basis of the type specimens of the eight original species described by Fritsch using material from Nýřany, Třemosna and Kounov, now in the Czech Republic. The type species Limnerpeton modestum is a nomen dubium restricted to a mandible that almost certainly be− longs to an amphibamid temnospondyl but is not critically diagnostic. “Limnerpeton” laticeps and “Limnerpeton” macrolepis lectotypes are both small individuals of the same taxon as the later described Mordex calliprepes Steen, 1938 and thus form part of the hypodigm of Mordex laticeps comb. nov. “Limnerpeton” elegans is now Limnogyrinus elegans and is a member of the temnospondyl family Micromelerpetontidae. “Limnerpeton” obtusatum is a specimen of the microsaur Microbrachis pelikani .“ Limnerpeton” dubium is an indeterminate tetrapod, probably either a temnospondyl or a pelycosaur. “Limnerpeton” difficile is a nomen dubium but the type is probably a small specimen of the tuditanomorph microsaur Crinodon limnophyes .“ Limnerpeton” caducum is almost certainly a specimen of the ophiderpetontid aistopod Oestocephalus granulosus. Several other described small temnospondyls from Nýřany are discussed and shown to be specimens of either Limnogyrinus elegans, Mordex laticeps or Amphibamidae incertae sedis. The tetrapod fauna at Nýřany includes four dissorophoid temnospondyls as proposed by Milner (1986) but with two changes in nomenclature. They comprise the branchiosaurid Branchiosaurus salamandroides, the micromeler− petontid Limnogyrinus elegans, the amphibamid Platyrhinops cf. lyelli and the primitive trematopid Mordex laticeps. These represent four of the five major dissorophoid families and demonstrate that the group had already diversified by the late Westphalian.",

The new fossil possesses dense scopulae prolaterally on the metatarsus and tarsus of the first pair of legs, con− firming placement of the Lagonomegopidae in Palpimanoidea along with the only other known families to exhibit this character. However, the individual setae differ between the new specimen and the other families, in that they have a pointed, hooked−tip on the metatarsus and a straight, pointed tip on the tarsus, rather than a spatulate tip.

Both genera, Labes and Lainodon, are considered to be representatives of the “zhelestids”, a paraphyletic unit regarded as being at the origin of Cenozoic ungulates within the Ungulatomorpha clade. We here describe Valentinella vitrollense gen. et sp. nov. from Vitrolles la Plaine (Maas− trichtian, southern France). This species, represented by fragmentary remains of lower and upper dentitions, is tentatively assigned to the “zhelestids” according to the hypoconulid−entoconid twinning and the antero−posteriorly short trigonid on m1–3. The occlusal surfaces are obliterated by dental attrition, but Valentinella could be an evolved “zhelestid”, more de− rived than Labes and Lainodon by its fully compressed trigonid. Valentinella is similar to Gallolestes by other derived characters such as a crushing specialization of the teeth, associated with a probably molariform p4 (or dp4) and slightly re− duced m3. The enamel microstructure, showing a radial prismatic pattern combined with a reduced interprismatic matrix, in which cristallites are oriented at about 45° to the prisms axes, appears compatible with the ancestral morphotype for all ungulates; although no synapomorphy can be proposed for the ungulatomorphs.",

Within the grade−level family Kentrio− dontidae, the new taxon is referred to the specifically and ecologically diversified subfamily Kentriodontinae, essentially defined by a well−developed posterolateral projection of the nasal. The elongated rostrum, the constriction of the asym− metric premaxillae at the base of the rostrum, the anteriorly elongated palatines, and the elevated vertex of T. joneti sug− gest closer affinities with the larger, more derived Macrokentriodon morani, from the middle Miocene of Maryland (USA). Among other features, T. joneti differs from the latter in having more numerous maxillary teeth and shorter zygomatic processes of the squamosals. Besides providing additional indications about the evolutionary trends within the Kentriodontinae, this occurrence constitutes the first record of the subfamily from the east coast of the North Atlantic based on a nearly complete skull. Considering their morphological diversity and wide geographic range, the Kentrio− dontinae may have constituted one of the dominant groups of Miocene oceanic dolphins.",

To add data to this ongoing investigation, we present the first detailed description of the microscopic morphology of the eggshell of this fossil bird. Our description of eggshells of two species of Lithornis is consistent with the placement of this fossil bird within Palaeognathae. Characters that corroborate this position include the presence of three aprismatic structural layers visible by use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in the eggshell microstructure. The placement of Lithornis phylogenetically close to the extant flighted South American group Tinamidae is supported on the basis of characters present in the structural composition of the eggshell layers of both these taxa",

All belong to a single taxon previously identified as Cyrtosymbole (Waribole) prima. This taxon is designated the type species of Osmolskabole gen. nov. A redefinition of this species, including the description of newly discovered, disarticulated exuviae both in limestone and silicified state of preservation, is given. In particular, silicified sclerites of various sizes allow the first complete growth series of a cyrtosymboline proetid to be presented. The close morphological resemblance of its protaspid stages to known proetoid larvae emphasizes the homogeneity of the early on− togeny in this superfamily. The Famennian proetoid anaprotaspis is also of comparable size to that of other Devonian proetoid larvae. However, their size−range is much less than that observed in Carboniferous larvae. This suggests that the survival of proetoid trilobites at the Frasnian−Famennian Kellwasser crisis did not result from a modification of the devel− opmental strategy, as it might have been the case at the terminal Devonian extinction event. Moreover, O. prima possesses a plectrum from the metaprotaspid to the mid meraspid periods. This implies that the natant hypostomal condition is not steadily acquired early in the ontogeny of the Proetida. Thus we preclude the use of this character in the diagnosis of this order.",

Secondarily phosphatised olenid trilobites from organic−rich limestones (orsten) in the Furongian (Upper Cambrian) of Vastergotland, south−central Sweden, are described and illustrated. All trilobites originate from the Peltura scara− baeoides Zone and were collected on the western slope of Kinnekulle. Only the dorsal exoskeletons have become second− arily phosphatised, and the ventral appendages are not preserved. Yet the material is otherwise remarkably well preserved and reveals the morphology of the olenid trilobites in greater detail than hitherto known. Species belonging to the genera Ctenopyge, Sphaerophthalmus, Parabolina, and Peltura are identified, and several juvenile specimens are present in the material. The material is disarticulated and fragmentary, and it has only been possible to identify a few specimens to spe− cies level. In addition to chaetognaths and conodonts, the trilobites are associated with pelmatozoan columnals, a possible camaroid, and fossils of uncertain affinities. These fossils, along with a probable conulariid fragment from the Peltura minor Zone, are also described and discussed. The presence of a benthic fauna of pelmatozoans, and possible conulariids and camaroids, indicates that at least parts of the Peltura zones were deposited during dysoxic rather than anoxic periods.

Six other stromatoporoid taxa, 5 other tabulate and 5 rugosan taxa occur uncommonly in the biostrome, mostly in both facies.The Katri biostrome is slightly younger than, but facially similar to biostromes in the middle Ludlow Hemse Group on Gotland ca.250 km WSW, with well-known stromatoporoid faunas.Corals are abundant in Hemse biostromes.Several key stromatoporoids occur in both the Hemse biostromes and Katri, but two abundant taxa in Hemse biostromes are absent in Katri and two tabulate corals abundant in Katri are missing in Hemse biostromes.Thus there was a wide distribution of such biostromes in the central Baltic large shallow marine carbonate platform, but with previously unreported variable assemblages presumed due to facies features not recognised in the sediments.",

    "abstract": "The atlas-axis complex has been described in few Palaeozoic taxa, with little effort being placed on examining variation of this structure within a small clade.Most varanopids, members of a clade of gracile synapsid predators, have well preserved atlas-axes permitting detailed descriptions and examination of morphological variation.This study indicates that the size of the transverse processes on the axis and the shape of the axial neural spine vary among members of this clade.In particular, the small mycterosaurine varanopids possess small transverse processes that point posteroventrally, and the axial spine is dorsoventrally short, with a flattened dorsal margin in lateral view.The larger varanodontine varanopids have large transverse processes with a broad base, and a much taller axial spine with a rounded dorsal margin in lateral view.Based on outgroup comparisons, the morphology exhibited by the transverse processes is interpreted as derived in varanodontines, whereas the morphology of the axial spine is derived in mycterosaurines.The axial spine anatomy of Middle Permian South African varanopids is reviewed and our interpretation is consistent with the hypothesis that at least two varanopid taxa are present in South Africa, a region overwhelmingly dominated by therapsid synapsids and parareptiles.",

    "abstract": "Among turtles, cases of \"gigantism\" occur mostly in pleurodiran Pelomedusoides and cryptodirans, but are infrequent among pleurodiran chelids, which are mostly small-medium sized turtles.Yaminuechelys spp.are extinct South American long-necked chelids (from the Late Cretaceous-early Paleocene of Patagonia, Argentina) with caparaces almost three times larger than their extant sister taxon, Hydromedusa tectifera.Since evolutionary changes in size can be analyzed based on growth dynamics, we studied growth strategies from an osteohistological point of view.We sampled both extinct (Yaminuechelys maior) and extant (H.tectifera) species, in order to test hypotheses related to the mechanisms involved in the macroevolution of size within this clade.For this purpose, thin sections of long bone (humerus and femur) shafts of specimens of different ontogenetic stages for these species were prepared.The osteohistological study reveals a similar growth dynamic in both taxa, with a poorly vascularized cortex dominated by parallel-fibered bone and interrupted by lines of arrested growth (LAGs).The huge body size of Y. maior appears to be a consequence of the prolongation of the growth phase, suggesting that it had a longer lifespan than H. tectifera, allowing to reach greater sizes.In this way, and assuming that there is no displacement at the beginning of development (e.g., a delay in the earliest stages of growth) in H. tectifera, the acquisition of a large size in Yaminuechelys would be explained by hypomorphosis of the former or hypermorphosis of the latter, depending on the reconstruction of the ancestral condition of this clade.",

    "abstract": "Among composite trace fossils, one of the most common structures throughout the Phanerozoic are structures (e.g., dwelling trace, feeding trace) reworked by Chondrites and/or Phycosiphon.However, differences in the nature of the reworking behaviors of these two ichnogenera remain unknown.Thus, in this study, composite Phymatoderma specimens from the Neogene deep-marine Shiramazu Formation in Japan, particularly those reworked by Chondrites and Phycosiphon, were analyzed to reveal the specific conditions that might control the activities of these trace-makers.Phymatoderma reworked by Phycosiphon is significantly larger than non-reworked Phymatoderma, whereas Phymatoderma reworked by Chondrites shows no significant difference in burrow diameter compared with non-reworked Phymatoderma .The recognized size selectivity (i.e., preference for larger burrows) by the Phycosiphon trace-maker can be explained by considering the different feeding strategies of these two ichnogenera; namely deposit-feeding Phycosiphon-makers, which must have processed a significant mass of sediment to obtain sufficient organic matter, whereas chemosymbiotic Chondrites-producers did not require a lot of sediment to obtain nutrients.In order to test these interpretations, a dataset of Phanerozoic trace fossils reworked by Chondrites/Phycosiphon were compiled.Consequently, the Phycosiphon-producers' preference toward relatively larger burrows was recognized, quantitatively supporting the results of this study.The compilation also indicates that the burrow size might have become one of the important limiting factors for the Phycosiphon-producers that tried to rework the sediments within previous subsurface burrows, at least for 80 million years.",

The presence of antennal allobasis and the features of the swimming legs unambiguously place the Miocene Apocyclops in the A. panamensis-clade, a predominantly amphi-Pacific group.The middle Miocene fossils with clear affinities to a subgroup of Apocyclops imply an early Miocene or Paleogene origin of the genus.Based on the geographic patterns of the species richness and morphology in Apocyclops and its presumed closest relative, genus Metacyclops, we hypothesize that: (i) the ancestor of Apocyclops, similar in morphology to some cave-dweller Metacyclops occurring today in the peri-Mediterranean region, might have arrived in North America from Europe via the Thulean North Atlantic bridge in the late Paleocene-early Eocene; (ii) Eocene termination of the Thulean land connection might have resulted in the divergence of Apocyclops from the Metacyclops stock.",

Following temporally coral assemblages, i.e., Disphyllum (lower Sitkowka and Checiny Beds) and Macgeea-Thamnophyllum (Kadzielnia Mbr, upper Sitkowka Beds) are mostly biostromes of branching corals of low taxonomical diversity typical for restricted relatively setting, rather unfavorable for rugosans. Exceptional are two Hexagonaria horizons with common massive colonies. Diffusolasma gen. nov., Sociophyllum severiacum sp. nov., Temnophyllum zamkowae sp. nov. and Hexagonaria hexagona kowalae subsp. nov. are proposed as the new taxa.",

    "abstract": "An assemblage of animal remains, the oldest from undoubted nonmarine beds, with structures attributable to at least one possible terrestrial animal, has been recovered in deposits of Early Silurian, Rhuddanian age, from the Central Appalachians. Other elements of a terrestrial ecosystem are plants at a nonvascular, possible liverwort-like, level of organization, and ascomycetes, predominantly terrestrial saprophytic and parasitic fungi (the oldest known). Together they provide evidence that pre-tracheophybc land plants and fungi, in association with invertebrates, occupied continental habitats by a1 least the earliest Silurian. While no evidence suggests that these organisms existed in a single community, they provide the earliest fossil record for the coexistence of varied organisms in the nonmarine ecosystem. Terrestrial invertebrates may have co-occurred with the earliest mid-Ordovician embryophytes although no fossil evidence for invertebrates exists before the Late Ordovician/Early Silurian. In view of the limited embryophytic dependence of many soil invertebrates, a preembryophytic evolution for them is consistent with the postulated significance of the soil habitat in terrestrialization and the evolution of feeding strategies among nonpredatory terrestrial invertebrates from microphytophagy to detritivory to herbivory as some emerged from within soils to soil litter to the soil surface. Detritivory can be regarded as a derivative extension of microphytophagy, since detritivkres only consume detritus 'processed' by microorganisms and may be selecting microorganisms from detrital substrates as the basis of their nutrition.",

We distinguish two types of corallum modifications, designated the monoporous and the polyporous types. In the adult monoporous type, the shell inhabited by the sipunculan is usually overgrown only in part by the coral base. There are two ori− fices: the main one and a smaller pore in the upper part of the corallum. In the polyporous type the shell inhabited by the sipunculan is entirely overgrown and the coral produces a spiralled sipunculan housing. In addition to the main orifice there are several pores in the lower part of the corallum. Heterocyathus priscus sp. n. from the Early Cretaceous (Albian) of France is the oldest example of symbiosis, in which the monoporous−type corallum was modified in the same way as in extant monoporous Heterocyathus. We speculate that the monoporous type was ancestral, as only this type is known to occur among Cretaceous corals. Morphological similiarities between Heteropsammia and cer− tain species of Heterocyathus, such as the Pourtales plan of septal arrangement and skele− ton porosity, may point to a close phylogenetic relationship.",

Increasing diversity ofthe clade is associated with increase in maximum body size during the radiation phase, and decreasing diversity is generally associated with a decrease in maximum body size. Two basic patterns of the maximum body size changes are observed dwing the decline of the clade. The first one is characterized by a high correlation between diversity and the maximum body size, and indicative of species atfrition that is nonselective with respect to the body size. The second one is characterized by a weak correlation between diversity and maximum body size, and typical of selective species attrition in relation to size.",

Four pollen/spore zones have been defined on the basis of key taxa and on the variation in the frequency of miospore groups. The palynofacies analysis indicates that a continental depositional environment prevailed during the Aalenian in Scania. A stratigraphic hiatus existed from the Aalenian then on until the Valanginian, when the depositional environment subsequently became marine. The marine conditions continued until the Cenomanian. A gradual increase in marine palynomorphs is found in the Cenomanian succession, indicating a transgression. On the basis of the palynoflora it is suggested that the vegetation consisted of cycads, conifers, pteridophytes and a very limited number of angiosperms.",

Presently the genus is known only from isolated teeth. The asymmetrical and symmetrical teeth are described as two morphotypes, ferox morphotype and nanus morphotype.

The regressive microfacies pattern is revealed by the presence of semi− restricted algal microbreccias that compose all of the lower part of the Famennian. The regression was accompanied by meteoric water invasion as the sea level fell. Seventy−six ostracod species are recorded. The ostracod assemblage, domi− nated by podocopids, belongs to the Eifelian ecotype and is indicative of a well−oxygenated marine environment below fair−weather wave base in the Frasnian part of the section, and of shallower environments in the base of the Famennian. No ostracod assemblage characteristic of hypoxic or semi−restricted water conditions has been recorded. The rate of ex− tinction of ostracod species (>70%) close to the Frasnian–Famennian boundary is comparable with that known on the same level in several other sections investigated in the world.

The assemblage of borers is suprisingly similar to Recent assemblages from coral reefs.

S. rugosa (Duncan and Wright, 1867), and Stylophyllopsis sp. A., conform to the overall stylophyllid morphology. Their septa consist of spines that are increasingly covered with sclerenchyme and low in the calice form compact blades. The pattern of diagenetic alteration of septa is di− verse but consistent within particular taxa. It suggests that the spectrum of the original microstructures is wider than tradi− tionally suggested for stylophyllids. In H. haimei, the septa are covered with dense granulations and completely recrystallized. Granulations also cover septal faces of Stylophyllopsis cf. rugosa and have rod−like foundations. In Stylophyllopsis sp. A., vestiges of the narrow mid−septal zone (similar to that in minitrabecular corals) occur in the proxi− mal part of larger septa, whereas septal spines which are similar to those in Stylophyllopsis cf. rugosa occur in their distal parts. Similar diversity of microstructures is reported also in Triassic stylophyllids that have aragonitic coralla. The pres− ence of distinct septal spines along with wide−ranging microstructural diversity of traditional Triassic–Jurassic stylophyllids, casts light on their possible evolutionary relationships, and can be a useful criterion for further revision of the group. For example, Jurassic thecocyathids, considered ancestral to caryophylliinans, share similar spiny/lobate septa with stylophyllids. Also Recent deep−water anthemiphylliids with spiny/lobate septa are strikingly similar to stylophyllids. Although this may be another example of parallel evolution, the separation of anthemiphylliids from other scleractinian clades on a mitochondrial 16S RNA tree topology suggests their ancient roots and enable us to suggest a stylophyllid ancestry. The supposed cyclic pattern of protoseptal insertion in Early Jurassic H. haimei supports the hy− pothesis of scleractinian−like (and not rugosan) ancestory of the stylophyllid evolutionary lineage.",

The investigated elements belong to three morphological groups, which represent at least two separate species: S. tenella, S. vernioryi, and a third form, whose brachials resemble those of S. vernioryi but are equipped with wings of different shape. The geometry of brachials’ articu− lar surfaces reveals that the arms of Saccocoma were relatively inflexible in their proximal part and left the cup at an angle of no more than 45 , then spread gradually to the sides. There is no evidence that the wings were permanently oriented in either horizontal or vertical position, as proposed by two different benthic life−style hypotheses. The first secundibrachial was probably more similar to the first primibrachial than to the third secundibrachial, in contrast to the traditional assump− tion. The winged parts of the arms were too close to the cup and presumably too stiff to propel the animal in the water effi− ciently. Swimming was probably achieved by movements of the distal, finely branched parts of the arms. The non− horizontal attitude of the winged parts of the arms is also not entirely consistent with the assumption that they functioned as a parachute. Moreover, the wings added some weight and thus increased the energy costs associated with swimming. The hydrodynamic benefits balancing these extra costs are not entirely clear, but it seems probable that the wings reduced the sinking rate of the animal not by increasing the pressure drag, as suggested by the parachute−analogy, but by increas− ing the surface drag (friction drag), which also harmonize with the presence of spines, reticulate sculpture and conspicu− ous vacuolar ornamentation in some species of Saccocoma.",

The relationships of the genera currently included in Xyelotomidae are briefly discussed. The genera Undatoma, Liaotoma, Leridatoma, and Davidsmithia have the unique apomorphy in the wing venation of the Tenthredinoidea minus Xyelotomidae. The Xyelotomidae is probably a paraphyletic family. Only a phylogenetic analy− sis will help to solve these problems. There is no evidence supporting the previous assignments of the fossil genera Vitimilarva and Kuengilarva to the family Xyelotomidae.",

In spite of its resemblance to the forms often attributed to Helodus, the tooth is referred to as Psephodus cf. magnus (Agassiz, 1838), and supposed to represent the anterior part of the dentition, based on a partly articulated specimen of Psephodus from the Carboniferous of Scotland. The analysis of early helodonts and psephodonts, and other Famennian chondrich− thyan crushing teeth, shows numerous similarities in tooth−base structure, such as the reduction of lingual basal extension, loss of articulation devices, development of numerous nutritive foramina, and the tendency to fusion between the teeth in a tooth−family. Based on these shared characters, close phylogenetic relationships between the Protacrodontoidea, Hybodontoidea, and the Holocephali are postulated.",

Fractal analysis of ostracod shell variability: A comparison with geometric and classic morphometrics. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 52 (3): 563–573. Two statistical methods, fractal geometry and geometric morphometrics, are tested for their applicability to ostracod sys− tematics. For this comparison, two morphologically similar ostracod species (Krithe compressa and Krithe iniqua) whose genus−level systematics is still incompletely resolved, are selected. Twenty−nine right valves of each species were col− lected from the upper Pliocene samples at the Monte San Nicola section in southern Italy. Statistical analyses (MANOVA on morphometric shape variables, and D values) were utilized to test if geometric morphometrics and fractal analysis are appropriate into discriminating between the two species. Both methods succeeded in distinguishing the species statisti− cally. The fractal analysis of the two ostracod species shows D values centered on 1.31±0.02 for Krithe iniqua and on 1.40±0.02 for Krithe compressa. Geometric morphometric analysis indicates significant differences between the two spe− cies and allows studying intra−populational variability as well as. The most variable traits indicated by geometric morpho− metrics are vestibular area and posterior outline of the shell, indicating that these traits are the most relevant for the sys− tematics of the species analyzed. Both fractal geometry and geometric morphometrics provide a measure of population variability. Fractal analysis has the advantage of being free from any subjectivity in the selection of characters and could be most appropriate to use for analysis of complex ornamentation for systematic purposes. However, a possible advantage of geometric morphometrics over fractal analysis is its ability to indicate where statistically significant variations in shape occur on the shell.",

The new genus is assigned to the subfamily Viarhynchiinae, family Tetrarhynchiidae. The shell of Antulanella is small to rarely medium-sized, subglobose, subcircular, fully costate, with hypothyrid rimmed foramen. The dorsal euseptoidum is much reduced. The dental plates are thin, ventrally divergent. The hinge plates are straight to ventrally convex. The crura possess widened distal ends, rarely raduliform or canaliform. The shell is composed of two calcitic layers. The secondary layer is fine fibrous, homogeneous built up of predominantly anisometric anvil-like fibres. Although data on the shell microstructure of post-Palaeozoic rhynchonellides are still incomplete, it is possible to distinguish two types of secondary layer: (i) fine fibrous typical of the superfamilies Rhynchonelloidea and Hemithiridoidea and (ii) coarse fibrous typical of the superfamilies Pugnacoidea, Wellerelloidea, and Norelloidea. The new genus Antulanella has a fine fibrous microstructure of the secondary layer, which is consistent with its allocation in the Hemithiridoidea. Antulanella pancici occurs in association with other brachiopods showing strong Peritethyan affinity and close resemblance to the Jura fauna (= Subtethyan fauna).",

    "abstract": "Euarthropods have a tough exoskeleton that provides crucial protection from predation and parasitism.However, this is restrictive to growth and must be periodically moulted.The moulting sequence is well-known from extant arthropods, consisting of: (i) the long inter-moult stage, in which no changes occur to the hardened exoskeleton; (ii) the pre-moult stage where the old exoskeleton is detached and the new one secreted; (iii) exuviation, when the old exoskeleton is moulted; and (iv) the post-moult stage during which the new exoskeleton starts as soft, thin, and partially compressed and gradually hardens to the robust exoskeleton of the inter-moult stage.Trilobite fossils typically consist of inter-moult carcasses or moulted exuviae, but specimens preserving the post-moult stage are rare.Here we describe nine specimens assigned to Symphysurus ebbestadi representing the first group of contemporaneous fossils collected that preserve all key stages of the moulting process in one taxon, including the post-moult stage.They were collected from a single lens in the Tremadocian part of the Fezouata Shale Formation, Morocco.Based on cephalic displacement and comparison to other trilobite moults, one specimen appears to represent a moulted exoskeleton.Four specimens are typical inter-moult carcasses.Four others are wrinkled and flattened, with thin exoskeletons compared to inter-moult specimens, and are considered post-moult individuals.These S. ebbestadi specimens illuminate the preservation and morphology of the post-moulting stage, characterised by strong anterior-posterior exoskeleton wrinkling, as well as overall body flattening and reduced visibility of thoracic articulations.Being found in the same lens, these specimens likely represent the first preserved in-the-act mass moulting event.The displayed sequence of moulting suggests the moulting process in trilobites was comparable to modern arthropods, and conserved within euarthropod evolutionary history.",

Distal carpal V is completely lost in dicynodonts and it is mainly fused to distal carpal IV in the adult stage of most other therapsid groups, but showed a delayed development in most non-mammaliamorph cynodonts.In mammaliamorphs, distal carpal V is not present.Our observations provide an updated revision of synapsid carpal homologies, mainly on the basis of position and anatomical contacts and also taking into account the results of embryological studies.",

Cavum epiptericum is a separate space with the taenia clino-orbitalis (ossified pila antotica) as the medial wall, anterior lamina of the petrosal and possibly the alisphenoid as the lateral wall, and the basisphenoid, petrosal and possibly alisphenoid ventrally. The fovea hypochiasmatica is shallow, tuberculurn sellae is wide and more raised from the skull base than it is in the genus Pseudobolodon. The dorsal opening of the carotid canal is situated in the fossa hypophyseos. The taenia clino-orbitalis differs from the one described in Pseudobolodon and Lambdopsalis in possessing just one foramen (metoptic foramen). Compared to all extant mammals the braincase in Nemegtbaatar and Chulsanbaatar is primitive in that both the pila antotica and pila metoptica are retained. In both genera the anterior lamina of the petrosal is large with a long anterodorsal process while the alisphenoid is small.

P. kowalaensis sp. n. occurred in level-bottom pioneer assemblages, thriving in reef downslope, mostly poorly-oxygenated habitats of the Kellwasser interval.

    "abstract": "Lower-Middle Ordovician (Arenig) successions in the East Baltic have been investigated for more than one hundred and fifty years. Nevertheless detailed sampling still yields new species and better knowledge of the environment in which these organisms lived. The successions are well suited for bed by bed sampling because of the lack of tectonic disturbance and because the sequences are well documented. This study analyses collections of Billingen-Volkhov age mainly from the St. Petersburg region, but also from Estonia. A great deal of the material was obtained from the marly to clayey, soft sediment that intercalates the compact packstones and wackestones in the succession. Twenty-nine of these clay horizons were used for diversity estimates on the fauna through the succession. The most thoroughly investigated groups for this investigation were rhynchonelliformean brachiopods, conodonts and ostracodes. The results indicate that variances in diversity and abundance levels for these groups were not correlated, either to each other or to the small-scale sea level fluctuations that have been suggested for the region. However, diversity dynamics of brachiopods and ostracodes confirm the large-scale upward shallowing of the basin into the Upper Volkhov. Comparison with fossils from the limestones did not reveal any differences in faunal composition between the two preservation modes. The detailed sampling, coupled with sampling of the recently described mud mounds that occur in several outcrops, yielded large numbers of specimens. This enabled revision of earlier poorly known rhynchonelliformean genera such as Ujukella Andreev, as well as better known genera such as Porambonites Pander. In total the examined faunas include 31 genera assigned to 53 species of rhynchonelliformean brachiopods. Of these Leoniorthis and Eoporambonites are defined as new genera, and the following new species are described: Neumania paucicostata, Ranorthis rotunda, Orthidium gambolovensis, Orthidium lavensis, Skenidioides minutus, Tetralobula peregrina, Idiostrophia prima and Idiostrophia tenuicostata.",

Shuotherium dongi Chow and Rich, 1982 was based on a dentary bearing seven teeth, originally interpreted as three premolars and four molars. Based on comparison with other groups of early mammals, we reinterpret the premolar-molar boundary in the holotype of S. dongi, and propose a dental formula of four (or more) premolars and three molars. The ultimate lower premolar (previously identified as the first molar) has a completely developed trigonid and no talonid or pseudo-talonid. We hypothesize that the mesial cingulid on molars of Australosphenida is a highly plausible structural antecedent to the pseudo-talonid of Shuotherium. This and other shared, derived features support a relationship of Shuotherium and Australosphenida as sister-taxa. We hypothesize that the common ancestor of Shuotherium + Australosphenida had a global distribution no younger than early Middle Jurassic, and that the respective clades diverged prior to full separation of Gondwanan and Laurasian landmasses.",

Since researches of Kielan-Jaworowska (1971) have shown that Cretaceous multituberculates are more closely related to monotremes than to other Mesozoic mammals it is suggested that the parameters of lactation in multituberculates were similar to those of their living relatives - the monotremes.

Coarsely ribbed (“cymatoceratid”), depressed nautiloids seem to predominate in nearshore environments. This may be regarded as an adaptive response to increasing predation pressure by durophages, especially in shallow water set− tings, which may have triggered the development of defensive morphologies (i.e., ornamented, predation−resistant shells) in Cretaceous shallow−water nautiloids.",

    "abstract": "The comparative physiology of living mammals strongly suggests that lactation was an early and fundamental feature of mammals. Because the young are fed on the mother's body secretions, supplying food to the neonates can be much more independent of the a vailable food resources than is the case for reptiles or for birds, whose parents must find food for them In the immediate environment. Mammals are therefore particularly well suited to breeding in environments in which there is insufficient diversity of food available to support a breeding population of large birds or large reptiles. Mammals also sustain a very high rate of postnatal growth, because it is the larger and more experienced parents which are doing most of the work to obtain the food which supports the growth of the young. The interval between conception and sexual maturity is very short in many mammals, very much shorter than the same interval for reptiles and most birds. It is concluded that current thinking about the ecological relationships between Mesozoic mammals, birds and reptiles may place too much emphasis on endothermy and viviparity, and not enough emphasis on lactation and other forms of parental feeding.",

Vesperalia perplexa has high−crowned scales with ridges that cross the entire surface or frequently fade mid−crown and after a smooth area continue on the posterior edge. Stranggewebe in the crowns of V. perplexa scales has large oriented lacunae and a well−developed system of main vascular canals. Fecundosquama basiglobosa scales have an undeveloped neck, a crown with only marginal sculptural incisions and have an unusually large deep base. Sim− ple bone−like mesodentine in the crowns of F. basiglobosa scales lacks principal vascular canals. Arenaceacanthus arcuatacanalis has diagnostic scales with anterior ridges that fade out at one−third of crown length, and crowns composed of simple acellular meso− and durodentine with the original arcuate radial vascular canals over the base. Bracteatacanthus assiduus scale crowns have short ridges of asymmetric profile and an antero−median sulcus, whereas scales of Rohoni− lepis breviornatus have sharp symmetric subradial crown ridges sloping towards the base. Scale crowns of B. assiduus and R. breviornatus are composed of dentine and durodentine, but the former is distinguished by a second area of multibranched radial vascular canals positioned high in the neck.",

Eocenomyrma resembles two extant genera: Myrmica and Temnothorax (both of which also occur in late Eocene European amber), but differs from them by the fol− lowing apomorphies: clypeus short and broad, with two lateral longitudinal carinae and distinctly marked anterolateral corners, its median portion faintly concave transversally, anterior margin broad and shallowly concave medially, with pairs of long setae situated on the anterolateral clypeal corners, and central part of the anterior clypeal margin without setae; middle and hind tibiae lacking the spurs.

    "abstract": "Nyctitheriids are primitive insectivores that were relatively abundant and diverse in North America and Europe during the middle Paleocene through to the middle Oligocene. The nyctitheriids from Asia are poorly known and show several distinctive characters. Here we describe the late Paleocene Asionyctia guoi gen. et sp. nov., the first fairly well known Asian nyctitheriid, from the Subeng locality near the city of Erlianhot (Erenhot) in Inner Mongolia, China. Among its most conspicuous features are the paraconid positioned high on p4, the rather primitive morphology and size of p3, the premolariform P4/p4 and the transverse upper molars with a small, straight postcingulum. Except for the paraconid po− sitioned high on p4, these combined features are also present in other Asian nyctitheriids, but absent in North American or European forms. We performed a cladistic analysis, based on a set of 20 dental characters, to resolve higher−level phylogenetic relations within Nyctitheriidae. The strict consensus tree groups all Asian forms in a single clade, for which we propose the rank of a subfamily and the name Asionyctiinae subfam. nov. Within Nyctitheriidae, a semimolariform P4/p4, as in Leptacodon tener, is considered primitive, and we consider the morphologically simpli− fied P4/p4 of Asionyctiinae derived within Nyctitheriidae. Asionyctiinae can be derived from an American, primitive Leptacodon−like ancestor migrating into Asia, with the reduction of P4/p4 occurring on the Asian continent. Consider− ing the derived morphology and the relatively high diversity of Asionyctiinae during the Asian late Paleocene, and the inferred conservative nature of the family Nyctitheriidae, we suggest an early Tiffanian time for the migration of nyctitheriids into Asia.",

This new species is the only Mesozoic record of this genus and highlights survival of a rare and enigmatic group of cartilagi− nous fishes across the Paleozoic–Mesozoic boundary. In the Vega−Phroso Siltstone Member of the Sulphur Mountain Formation (western Canada), two kinds of numerous dermal denticles identified as Listracanthus occur predominantly in strata probably of early Smithian age. The new species differs from all other known species of the genus in the structure of the anterior and posterior borders of the large denticles. The small denticles appear to be less diagnostic than the large ones and are readily distinguished from small denticles generally assigned to the genus Petrodus. Histology reveals that the largest denticles were originally hollow, probably secondarily ossified as acellular bone. The conclusion drawn by previous authors that Listracanthus may be a petalodontid shark, based on ambiguous non−skeletal associations with Deltoptychius, Petrodus, or Calopodus is not supported by this study. The large number of denticles, the size of both types of denticles and their arrangement suggest that Listracanthus pectenatus sp. nov. was a large chondrichthyan of aberrant body shape and yet uncertain systematic position.",

Among them Zenaspis dzieduszyckii sp. nov. differs from all other representatives of the genus by its smaller overall size and relatively larger or− bits. Wladysagitta janvieri is remarkable by having a rostral process. This new species together with “Cephalaspis” acutirostris Stensio, 1932 from Old Red deposits of Shropshire (Great Britain) are proposed to be united under common generic name Wladysagitta. Since Diademaspis sp. is completely unknown in outline of its shield, it could not be named as new species, although it should be a really new form. New diagnostic features, such as relative width of the orbits, rela− tive width of the dorsal field, and the position of the posterior end of the lateral fields relatively to the margins of the headshield, are proposed to differentiate genera within the Zenaspididae. Probably, the rostral process of osteostracans should be considered as a multifunctional device having at least a sensory function for food−search, possibly hydrody− namic functions, or may play a role in scaring predators.",

Microfusellar tissue is composed of both fully developed and reduced microfuselli. The former consists of the fusellar and the cortical components and may pass into reduced microfuselli due to skipping the fusellar phase of secretion. This demonstrates a possible mechanism of the transition from the fusellar to the cortical tissue and sheds some light on principles governing the morphogenesis of graptolite skeletal tissues. Formation of particular fabrics and patterns was determined by control of a certain innate potential of secretory cells. Modes of changes in this control are identified and a working hypothesis concerning the evolution of graptolite skeletal tissues is advanced.",

The phylogenetic relationships of the Albanerpetontidae with other lissamphibian groups are still uncertain: different cladistic analy− ses nest this group as the sister−taxon of all living lissamphibians (caecilians, salamanders, and frogs) or only of frogs and salaman− ders (Gardner 2001; McGowan 2002; Ruta et al. 2003). Currently the family Albanerpetontidae includes three valid genera (Gardner et al. 2003; Venzel and Gardner 2005): Albanerpeton Estes and Hoffstetter, 1976 from the Early Cretaceous–early Pliocene de− posits of North America and Europe (seven species), Celtedens McGowan and Evans, 1995 from the Late Jurassic?–Early Creta− ceous of Europe (two species) and Anoualerpeton Gardner, Ev− ans, and Sigogneau−Russell, 2003 from the Middle Jurassic–Early Cretaceous of Europe and North Africa (two species). Curtis and Padian (1999: figs. 11, 12) assigned to the Caudata two atlantes from the Early Jurassic Kayenta Formation in Ari− zona, USA. These atlantes are short and have a very deep posterior cotyla (seemingly notochordal), a foramen for the first spinal nerve and a broad intercotylar tubercle flanked by shallow, weakly expanded laterally anterior cotylae. According to this complex of characters, these atlantes more likely belong to Albanerpetontidae rather than Caudata (Averianov et al. in press). If so, the Kayenta specimens extend temporal range of the group back to the Early Jurassic. The albanerpetontid fossil record in Asia was limited to five dentaries of unidentified genus from the Upper Cretaceous Khodzhakul (lower Cenomanian) and Bissekty (middle–upper Turonian) formations, Kyzylkum Desert, Uzbekistan (Nessov 1981; Gardner and Averianov 1998).

It is con− cluded that the name Pleurophopsis should not be used because the presently known material of its type species, P. unioides of middle Miocene age, does not show critical hinge details like nymph, subumbonal pit, and cardinal tooth 3a of the right valve. From the presently known char− acters, it can be concluded that Adulomya? unioides is very similar to the type species of Adulomya and Ectenagena, and it is shown that Ectenagena is a synonym of Adulomya. How− ever, should better preserved material of P. unioides become available and confirm its close relation to Adulomya and Ectenagena, Pleurophopsis would have priority as it is the oldest of the three names.",

The holotype includes most of the skull with basicranium, mandibles, well preserved upper and lower dentitions, partially articulated left manus and right tarsus, and most of the long bones in the limbs. The presence of a rudimentary 1st metatarsal is confirmed in mesonychids, and the relatively unworn lower incisors display an unexpected trilobed morphology. Autapomorphies of this new species are short face, absence of diastemata between the lower premolars (except between p1 and p2), m3 metaconid subequal to protoconid, and foramen for superior ramus of stapedial artery entirely within the petrosal. A phylogenetic analysis of 89 characters scored for 14 mesonychians and 5 outgroups resulted in 8 most parsimonious trees. Dissacus zanabazari is in a clade with D. navajovius, but this genus is otherwise paraphyletic. The strict consensus of the eight trees has a mono− phyletic Mesonychia, Hapalodectidae, and Mesonychidae; Dissacus and Ankalagon as the most basal mesonychid gen− era; and paraphyly of Pachyaena.",

In view of such differences, the writer concludes that the tubothecae are elements strange to graptolite colonies. These are tubes of other animals which lived in association with graptolite colonies. Most likely, they were Annelida Polychaeta of the class Eunicea, which nowadays happen to be commensals of the corals Scleractinia and which secrete tubes similar to tubothecae. The remains of the Eunicea abundantly occur in the Ordovician along with the remains of graptolites and their associations might be realized as early as that epoch.",

    "abstract": "Echinoids represent an important component of the Cenozoic marine benthic communities.Their diversity in the Mediterranean area is reviewed within the Late Miocene-Recent, a period of remarkable paleogeographic and paleoclimate changes.Of the 37 genera that lived during the Late Miocene, only Holaster, Pliolampas, and Trachyaster did not survive the Messinian Mediterranean salinity crisis (MSC), indicating that this event was not as drastic as for other marine groups.The presence of Brissopsis within the uppermost Messinian testifies to the existence of fully marine conditions at least towards the end of the MSC.Severe drops in the echinoid diversity, involving the loss of 40% of the Pliocene genera, occurred during the Piacenzian, likely because of the onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation.Most of the echinoid extinctions correlate with the crisis of the Mediterranean bivalve assemblage recorded at about 3 Ma.The Early Pleistocene progressive cooling caused the disappearance of further thermophilous shallow-water genera (Clypeaster, Schizechinus, Echinolampas) and allowed the entrance of temperate taxa (Paracentrotus lividus, Placentinechinus davolii and Sphaerechinus granularis) from the Atlantic.Some deep-water taxa (Histocidaris sicula, Stirechinus scillae, Cidaris margaritifera), whose Recent relatives are currently restricted to tropical areas, are not found in the area after the Calabrian possibly because of the disappearance of the psychrosphere.The extant Mediterranean echinoid fauna mainly derives from the Late Miocene fauna, reduced after several climatic changes by about 43% at the genus level.The recent increase of the sea surface temperatures allowed the entrance of the Lessepsian Diadema setosum and confined the deep-water species of Holanthus to the coldest areas of the basin, making this genus endangered.",

    "abstract": "The fusellar tissue of Palaeozoic rhabdopleurid pterobranchs has been studied using the SEM techniques. The fibrillar material of Ordovician Kystodendron ex gr. longicarpus and Rhabdopleurites primaevus exhibits a distinct dimorphism, comprising: (1) thinner, wavy and anastomosing/branching fusellar fibrils proper, producing a tight three-dimensional meshwork; and (2) long, more or less straight and unbranched cortical fibrils, sometimes beaded, and arranged in parallel. These fibrils are similar to the fusellar and cortical fibrils of graptolites, respectively. Until now, dimorphic fibrils and their arrangement within fusellar tissue were regarded as unique characters of the Graptolithina. In general, the fibrillar material of these fossils is partially preserved in the form of flaky material (new term) composed of flakes (new term). Flakes are interpreted as flattened structures originating from the fusion of several neighbouring tightly packed fibrils. A Permian rhabdopleurid, referred to as Diplohydra sp., reveals a fabric and pattern of fusellar tissue similar to that of both Ordovician rhabdopleurids but devoid (?) of cortical fibrils. The results presented here question views that: (1) substantial differences in fabric and pattern of fusellar tissue exist between fossil pterobranchs and graptolites; and (2) the ultrastructure of pterobranch periderm has remained unchanged at least since the Ordovician. The Palaeozoic rhabdopleurids investigated are closer ultrastructurally to graptolites than to contemporary pterobranchs. The pterobranchs and the graptolites should be treated as members of one class the Graptolithoidea.",

The distinct influence of regional shallowing−upward cycles on the composition of gastropod fauna have been observed. Composition changes of this fauna were controled by IIb/c, IIc, and IId cycles. Early Frasnian reef association appeared with predominantly thick−shell gastropods, which occur in the upper Sitkowka Beds. At the beginning of IIb/c cycle, Kadzielnia−type mud mounds with a high diversified gastropod as− sociation appeared. The next cycles caused the disappearance of mud mounds (IIc), the sinking of the Dyminy reef (IId), and extinction of the gastropod associations from the upper Sitkowka Beds. Two gastropod associations and one poorly diversified lagoonal assemblage predominated in the reef−cap stage. Frasnian reef gastropods have not been observed in the Famennian and Early Carboniferous series. Thus, they probably became extinct together with the collapse of the Frasnian reef ecosystem near the Frasnian–Famennian boundary. Twenty seven taxa have been recognized, among them three new species and two new genera are described: Kowalatrochus sanctacrucensis gen. et sp. nov., Grabinopsis guerichi gen. et sp. nov., and Loxoplocus (Donaldiella) karczewskii sp. nov.

    "abstract": "Organic tubes of Sabelliditidae are a characteristic element of Lower Cambrian faunas. They were commonly compared with tubes of sedentary polychaetes, until Sokolov (1965) suggested their close affinity with Recent pogonophores. The aim of the present paper is to verify the latter hypothesis through a better understanding of ultrastructural features of zooidal tubes in both groups considered. The ultrastructure of the tube in Sabelliditida recognized for the first time by Urbanek, 1976 (in press), reveals that the wall of the tube is composed of two almost homogenous layers - the outer one and the inner one, and of the middle distinctly laminar layer. Characteristic wrinkles on the outer surface of the tube are made solely of the outer layer which is almost homogenous or with faint traces of some lammiation. The tubes in all Pogonophora under study display an entirely laminar structure. Wrinkles observed on certain areas of the tube are due to foldings involving numerous layers of the tube wall. Earlier biochemical and ultrastructural data and results of our ultrahistochemical observations are indicative of the presence of chitin, proteins (probably sclerotins) and mucopolysaccharides in the pogonophore tubes. The above results contribute to a better knowledge of the organic skeleton in both groups in question, but the problem of sabelliditid/pogonophore affinities remains unresolved. The degree and specificity of resemblance recognized at the submicroscopic level is not sufficient to confirm or disprove the hypothesis on close relationship between both groups considered.",

Six major carbonate microfacies (MF1–MF6) ranging from open−marine environments below storm wave base to pre−evaporitic supratidal lagoons were recognized. The sedimentological study detected no important sedimentological changes during the Alamo Event; only an influx of detrital material and lithoclasts indicate that an unusual event had oc− curred. Ostracods are generally rare or absent in the lower member of the Devils Gate Limestone, and only 2,000 cara− paces, valves and fragments were extracted; from these some 26 taxa were identified. Two new species, Voronina? eureka and Serenida dorsoplicata are proposed. The ostracods belong to the Eifelian Mega−Assemblage and their distribution was influenced by strong salinity variations. Because of the rarity and low diversity of ostracods and conodonts in sam− ples collected from the lower part of the lower member of the Devils Gate Limestone it is not adequate to demonstrate conclusively an extinction event close to the Alamo Event Bed. Nevertheless the greater abundance and diversity of ostracods above this bed seems to indicate that the Alamo Event did not result in significant extinction of ostracod taxa in this shallow water setting. The ostracod fauna present in the lower member of the Devils Gate Limestone suggests faunal exchanges between Nevada and the Russian Platform via the Western Canadian platform.",

    "abstract": "The brachiopod faunas from deposits recording the Early–Middle Frasnian transition of Poland are poorly known. The present report describes these faunas that were recovered from Wietrznia and Kostomloty (Holy Cross Moun− tains) and Debnik (Silesian−Cracow Upland) regions positioned on the southern Polish carbonate shelf. The brachio− pod distribution was analysed relative to a significant 13C excursion, referred recently to as Palmatolepis punctata Event. The sporadic occurrence of brachiopods at Debnik makes it difficult to analyse the biotic response to this geo− chemical anomaly. However, higher brachiopod frequency in the topmost part of the section coincides with a gradual decrease of 13C down to the Frasnian background values. At two studied sections at Wietrznia the greatest taxonomic diversity and abundance of brachiopods (Flabellulirostrum–Coeloterorhynchus assemblage) are confined to the Pal− matolepis transitans Zone. In the following Pa. punctata Zone brachiopods are rare (Biernatella lentiformis assem− blage) or absent, which suggests a serious deterioration of the environmental conditions linked probably with periods of benthic anoxia−dysoxia and oligotrophic conditions in the basin. In two Kostomloty sections brachiopods faunas of this age are members of the mostly monospecific rhynchonellid−dominated Phlogoiderhynchus polonicus assem− blage which inhabited deeper−water environments characteristic of intrashelf oxygen−depleted basins of Łysogory− Kostomloty region. In some horizons large shells of P. polonicus were frequently colonised by discinoid Romerella? sp. Among 28 species described in this report new forms include: Flabellulirostrum kielcensis sp. nov., F. rackii sp. nov., and Thomasaria ventosa sp. nov.",

In contradistinction to previous views according to which astrorhizae were con­ sidered as structure formed by stolons or zooids of the Stromatoporoidea, the author concludes that they are traces of foreign orgoanisms associated with the Stromatoporoidea. The relationships between both organisms were probably com­ mensal or mutualistic in character. On the basis of associations observed in Recent sponges and coelenterates, the author has discussed the possibility of a plant (algae) or animal (non-skeleta,l coelenter,ates) nature of the organisms which were associated with the Stromatoporoidea. Depending on the manner of connecting astrorhizae with the skeletal tissue ,of the coenosteum, two types of these structures, Le. a) integrated and b) separated, have been distinguished ,and their morphological and growth interpretation attempted. The new interpretation of astrorhizae allows one to eliminate these structures as diagnostic features of the Str,omatoporoidea which may to a considerable extent simplify the taxonomy of this group.",

Among the thirteen described taxa, five are new: Spinatrypa tumuli sp. n., Zowatrypa circuitionis sp. n., ?Waiotrypapluvia sp. n., Desquamatia (Desquamatia) quieta sp. n. and Desquamatia (?Seratrypa) derelicta sp. n. Supposed lissatrypid 'Glassia drevemzanni' Maillieux, 1936 from the late Frasnian Matagne shales is assigned to the Rhynchonellida. On the southern flank of the Dinant Synclinorium and in the Philippeville Massif, the Atrypida become extinct in the Palmatolepis rhenana Zone, significantly below the Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) boundary. Their extinction coincides with the first appearance of the green and black shales of the late Frasnian Matagne Formation, recording a transgressive-hypoxic event. Based on conodont data, this event takes place earlier on the southern flank of the Dinant Synclinorium than in the Philippeville Massif.",

    "abstract": "Triassic corals with septa that branch repeatedly and centripetally are here assigned to a new genus Furcophyllia. Septa of F. septafindens (Volz, 1896), re−described from the Italian Dolomites, are composed of 3–10 blades (“septal brooms”). Distances between adjacent septa and their branches are equal, and the thickness of all blades is approximately the same throughout ontogeny. However, none of the septal brooms show the same branching pattern. Proposed herein is a simple computer model that reproduces septal pattern, similar to that of Furcophyllia, based on a minimal set of rules: (i) uniform coverage of intra−calicular space; (ii) regular bifurcations following some probability; (iii) keeping some minimal dis− tance between septal branches. The elaborate septal pattern of Furcophyllia suggests a distinct organization of the polyp’s soft tissue, especially mesenteries whose appearance in modern corals is associated with insertion of sclerosepta. Hypoth− esis 1 suggests that mesenterial pairs flanked only “septal brooms” and that septal branches functionally corresponded with septal microarchitecture. Hypothesis 2 suggests that mesenterial pairs developed between all septal branches that functionally correspond with conventional septa. Delicate menianae, which developed on Furcophyllia septal faces (and many other Triassic corals) resemble similar septal microarchitecture of the Recent agariciid Leptoseris fragilis and may be closely related to the suspension feeding strategy of this coral. The furcate septal arrangement in Furcophyllia is unique among Triassic corals, and generally, among Mesozoic and Cenozoic corals. The only analogous corals are Creta− ceous aulastraeoporids (e.g., Preverastrea, Paronastraea), Trochoidomeandra, and some Jurassic rhipidogyrids having secondary (apophysal) septal branches. In some Recent caryophylliids (Trochocyathus rhombocolumna, Phacelocyathus flos) primary septa may also split dichotomously and centripetally.",

The Alepocephalidae described below occur in zones IPM 5-6 according to the latest biostratigraphic subdivision of the Menilite Beds (Kotlarczyk and Jerzamnska 1976).

The lithostratigraphic profiles of these localities will be published later. One specimen only is derived from the Subsilesian Unit. The site is situated in the village Przysietnica (Jerzmanska 1968). True fossil Alepocephalidae were hitherto unknClwn. Although Daniltshenko (1960) included the new genus and species Palaeotroctes stricr.us, frcm the Oligocene of the Caucasus, in this family, according to Arambourg (1967) this form belongs to the Gonostomatidae.

The rounded outline of the scar of the posterior adductor muscle and the lack of the septa indicate that all the specimens must be referred to the genus Lingula.

The original, and only, type specimen of P. macilentus collected by Tornquist being lost, a neotype is herein selected from a small collection of Thuringian material. The genus has now been redefined and based on this, and SEM studies of iso− lated material, the defining characteristics of the genus are (i) the possession of a simple ancora umbrella with five radial lists with an incompletely developed rim; (ii) an ancora umbrella separated from lateral ancora sleeve walls by exception− ally large lateral orifices; (iii) the possession of mid−ventral lists; (iv) simple, orderly zigzag lateral wall ancora sleeve lists.

    "abstract": "Themost distinctive and important element of the hydrostatic organ of ammonoids and nautiloids is the siphuncular tube. It consists of mineral and organic segments (so−called connect− ing rings). The connecting ring of ammonites never preserves its original organic matter in the mineralized state, usually having undergone diagenetic phosphatisation, more rarely, calcification, or even complete loss. Our knowledge about its original ultrastructure is based upon comparison with Recent Nautilus and phosphatised or calcified ammonite fossils. We show that depending on the taphonomic history, both calcium phosphate and calcite can participate in the diagenesis of the connecting ring wall. Under standard light microscopy, the phosphatised elements are indistinguishable from the calcified ones. Both are dark brown in colour, due to an excess of car− bon. The structure of the phosphatised siphuncle does not closely replicate the structure of its organic elements. This casts doubts on conclusions of other authors who described a complex porous structure in ammonite siphuncles, which is completely dissimilar to the siphuncular structure of Recent Nautilus and suggests that this organ functioned differently in ammonites. SEM observations using a BSE detector on the calcified parts of the walls of connecting rings revealed a mul− tilayered structure with perpendicular elements connecting particular layers, resembling the structure of a stacked nacre− ous layer.",

Here, we use morphometry of the radius in extant carnivorans of the dog family (Canidae) to reconstruct the palaeobiology of extinct canids from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania (Bed I and II) and Koobi Fora, Kenya. We use radius morphometrics to predict adaptation to prey size and introduce a new method for quantifying canid habitat adaptations based on the geographic distributions of the extant species sampled. Linear Discriminant Function Analyses (DFA) and cluster neighbour-joining algorithms are employed to investigate radial morphometrics as described by 29 linear measurements. Results of our analyses suggest that a phylogenetic signal is present in radial morphometrics, even if it does not allow us to accurately discriminate among genera. A binary prey size categorisation of “small-medium” versus “large” prey can be more accurately predicted than a habitat categorisation scheme (Open, Mixed, Closed). The East African fossil specimens examined show morphometric affinities with the golden jackal (Canis aureus) and coyote (Canis latrans) and are likely attributable to the genus Canis. Fragmentary fossil specimens from Olduvai Gorge are predicted as habitat generalists (Open for Bed I and Mixed for Bed II) adapted for hunting small-medium prey, whereas the specimen from Koobi Fora was predicted as inhabiting mixed habitats and adapted for killing large prey. This study supports the inclusion of fossil Canidae in palaeoecological analyses attempting to clarify the palaeoenvironment of early hominin fossil sites.",

    "abstract": "The unusually shortened limbs of giant theropods, including abelisaurids, carcharodontosaurids, and derived tyrannosauroids such as Tyrannosaurus rex have long been an object of wonder, speculation, and even derision on the part of both paleontologists and the public.Two questions commonly asked are \"Why did the forelimbs become so short?\" and \"What did the animals use such short forelimbs for, if for anything?\"Because basal tyrannosauroids and their outgroups, as well as the outgroups of other giant theropods, had longer forelimbs, the foreshortening of these elements in derived taxa was secondary, and it ostensibly involved a shift in developmental timing of the forelimb elements.Factors proposed to have influenced the evolutionary foreshortening include natural selection, sexual selection, energetic compensation, ontogenetic vagaries, and rudimentation due to disuse.Hypotheses of use have varied from a supporting anchor that allows the hindlimbs a purchase to stand from a reclining position to a pectoral version of pelvic claspers during intercourse to a sort of waving display during sexual or social selection.None of these hypotheses explain selective regimes for reduction; at best, they might argue for maintenance of the limb, but in all cases a larger limb would have suited the function better.It is likely that we have been looking the wrong way through the telescope, and that no specific function of the forelimbs was being selected; instead, another crucial adaptation of the animal profited from forelimb reduction.Here I propose, in the context of phylogenetic, ontogenetic, taphonomic, and social lines of evidence, that the forelimbs became shorter in the context of behavioral ecology: the great skull and jaws provided all the necessary predatory mechanisms, and during group-feeding on carcasses, limb reduction was selected to keep the forelimbs out of the way of the jaws of large conspecific predators, avoiding injury, loss of blood, amputation, infection, and death.A variety of lines of evidence can test this hypothesis.",

Ostracodes, which are the most numerous in the sample, were studied by Olempska (1999). Brachiopods and conodonts are described and illustrated in this paper, but other associated fossils are also noted. Among brachiopods the most common are productides, orthotetidines, spiriferides, and orthides. The productoid gen. et sp. indet. 2, Lambdarina sp., and rhynchonelloid gen. et sp. indet. most probably represent new taxa, but are described in open nomenclature because of inadequate material. Conodonts are indicative of late Tournaisian age. The fossil assemblage is represented by phosphatic and silicified remnants, the latter being originally calcitic. The pattern of silicification resulted generally in preservation of skeletal morphology in great details.",

    "abstract": "Oligophyly may be defined as a restrictive factor in evolution leading to minimization of the number of phyletic lines owing to an occasional reduction by means of mass extinction as well as to their recovery from scanty survivors. The monophyletic origin of the vast majority of taxa finds its explanation in this succession of events, namely in the diversity reduction (DR) rediversification (RD) sequence. In turn, the recovery from a few or a single ancestral species (near-monophyly or monophyly) causes a number of consequences for the evolution of emerging new taxa. They produce a particular class of systematic groups called genealogical domains. Such groups display an exceptionally close affinity and a similar evolutionary potential exhibited i.e. an abundant parallelism. In other words, the paucity of ancestry (oligophyly) explains why both the monophyletic origin and evolutionary parallelism are such common features of the phylogeny in most fossil groups. Parallelism is caused by the similarity of apomorphic tendencies (known as `underlying synapomorphy' in phylogenetic systematics), which are among the most characteristic features of evolution within a genealogical domain. It is now evidenced that the vast majority of Late Silurian monograptid faunas are descendants of only two species survivors from the severe lundgreni Event. Numerous cases of heterochronic parallelism and evolutionary repetitions observed within the repertoire of the Late Silurian monograptid faunas may be explained as a far reaching effect of oligophyly. Each ancestral species established its own genealogical domain displaying certain apomorphic tendencies. The same is true for the monophyletic origin and early radiation of Llandovery monograptids. Whilst graptolites provide numerous graphic examples substantiating the oligophyly concept, it is clear that the phenomena discussed are of a much more general nature.",

Their biological role remain largely enigmatic. The view that graptoblasts were formed within the authothecae is rejected and a conclusion is advanced that graptoblasts were closed, resting terminal portions of the stolothecae, housing eneysted dormant zooids. They may be compared with the resting terminal zooids in Rhabdopleura and with the hibernacula of ctenostome bryozoans. Graptoblasts provided an adaptation allowing the species to survive the periods of adverse conditions when the rest of the colony disintegrated. One could hypothesize that after germination the graptoblasts produced small propagules ejected through a narrow cryptopyle and forming new colonies after they settled on the substrate.",

No traces of external second− ary deposits are found in coenecia. Two types of internal secondary deposits in tubes are recognized: (1) membranous de− posits, composed of numerous, tightly packed sheets, similar to the crustoid paracortex and pseudocortex; and (2) fibrillar deposits, devoid(?) of sheets and made of cortical fibrils, arranged in parallel and interpreted as equivalent to graptolite endocortex.

The cortical fabric of both rhabdopleuran species studied is composed of long, straight and more or less wavy, unbranched fibrils arranged in parallel; their diameters vary from 220 to 570 μm. The study shows that there is no significant difference between extinct and extant Graptolithoidea (= Pterobranchia) in the histological and ultrastructural pattern of their primary and secondary deposits of the periderm.

Lusorex taishanensis gen. et sp. nov. is closely related to Wilsonosorex from the early Hemingfordian of North America. Both are unusual in sharing well-developed conules on the,upper molars and reduced ectocingulids on the lowers, and most likely these sister taxa reflect faunal exchange between North America and NE Asia in early Miocene time.

This method was recently applied by Ruta to a fossil group of enigmatic Palaeozoic forms, the stylophoran echinoderms. Ruta's supertree suggested that mitrates are polyphyletic and originated from paraphyletic cornutes. Re-examination of Ruta's data matrix strongly suggests that most source trees were based on dubious homologies resulting from theory-laden assumptions (calcichordate model) or superficial similarities (ankyroid scenario). A new supertree analysis was performed using a slightly corrected version of Ruta's original combined matrix; the 70% majority-rule consensus of 24,168 most parsimonious supertrees suggests that mitrates are monophyletic and derived from paraphyletic cornutes. A second new supertree analysis was generated to test the influence of the pruning of three taxa in some calcichordate source trees; the 70% majority-rule consensus of 3,720 shortest supertrees indicates that both cornutes and mitrates are monophyletic and derived from a Ceratocystis-like ancestor. The two new supertree analyses demonstrate the dramatic influence of the relative contributions of each initial assumption of plate homologies (and underlying anatomical interpretations), in original source trees, on the final topology of supertrees.",

    "abstract": "Despite independent evolution of coloniality in hemichordates and bryozoans, their colonies show common features. In both instances colony is a genet or clonal system composed of zygotic oozooid and a number of blastozooids (= modules) integrated by physical continuity of tissues, sharing a common genotype and subject to common morphogenetic control. In some groups of graptolites and bryozoans, colonies display a regular morphological gradient. Simple graptoloid and bryozoan colonies consist of a proximal zone of astogenetic change and a distal zone of astogenetic repetition. Observed morphological gradient may be attributed to diffusion, along the colony axis, of a morphogen produced by the oozooid; in the zone of astogenetic change the morphogen is above certain threshold level and drops below it in the zone of astogenetic repetition. This model is supported by observations on regeneration of fractured graptoloid colonies. Regenerative branch never displays astogenetic change. The same rule is valid for regeneration of fractured bryozoan colonies. While the early astogeny of simple bryozoan colonies may be explained within the framework of the gradient theory, the late astogeny of more complex ones involves multiple succession of zones of change and repetition, without analogy in astogeny of graptoloids. Thus, late astogeny in bryozoan colonies may be controlled by cyclic somatic/reproductive changes, probably independent of the primary morphogen. Evolutionary changes in the graptoloid colonies involve both the spreading of the novelties over a greater number of zooids (penetrance) and an increase in the degree of phenotypic manifestation of a given character (expressivity). In the phylogeny of bilaterian colonies morphogenetic gradient probably originated as a sort of a side effect of sexual process leading to the appearance of the oozooid. The latter contaminated the neighbouring blastozooids with the products of its own morphogenesis. The resulting morphogenetic gradient could be used by selective forces to produce various effects of adaptive significance. Morphogens responsible for patterning of bilaterian colonies are probably related to the products of genes responsible for the anteroposterior control of embryos in all solitary Bilateria (Hox, zootype genes).",

The new genus Blinia is established for Sarmatian species which are characterized by a protoconch indicative of lecithotrophic type of early development lacking even a short free−swimming larval stage. In contrary the protoconch of Badenian “Tectura” zboroviensis demonstrates features of the shell typical for planktonic larva. The shape and proportions of a pancake−like protoconch in Blinia species suggest the development of young snails in brood pouch in the mantle cavity of maternal individual. The independence of Blinia gen. nov. from other Patellogastropoda such as Tectura, Patella, and Helcion is supported also by characteristics of shell structure. Typical patellogastropod protoconchs are present in the Badenian and the first half of the early Sarmatian and the protoconchs indicating lecithotrophic development are observed in patellogastropods only from the younger half of early Sarmatian and middle Sarmatian deposits. The change in ontogenetic strategy occurred during time of lowered salinity in the Paratethys. We suggest that the snails’ reproductive strategy was modified and free larval life was suppressed to cope with salinity change in the ambient water.",

    "abstract": "Organic membranes preserved in the rear part of the body chamber of the Late Cretaceous phylloceratid ammonite Phyllopachyceras ezoense were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on the basis of well−preserved specimens from Hokkaido, Japan. SEM observations revealed that the membranes are continuous with the siphuncular tube wall in the phragmocone and consist of two layers, both of which are made of a dark, primarily conchiolin mate− rial; namely, a thinner inner homogeneous layer and a thicker outer layer with gently inclined pillar−like units. Hence, they are interpreted as the precursory siphuncular membranes. The precursory siphuncular membranes are not associ− ated with any other organic components such as the siphuncular sheets reported in some Paleozoic and Mesozoic ammonoids. Unlike the tube−like condition in the phragmocone, the precursory siphuncular membranes in the body chamber of the specimens examined do not form a tube shape; on the ventral side the membranes are truncated and di− rectly contact the outer shell wall. These observations suggest that the inner and outer layers of the precursory siphuncular membranes in the body chamber were respectively formed by the siphuncular epithelium from the inner side and by the invaginated septal epithelium from the outer side. It is also postulated that at the initial stage of septal formation, the rear part of the body moved slowly forward, developing a circumsiphonal invagination of the septal epi− thelium. Because similar conchiolin membranes are occasionally preserved in the body chambers of other phyllo− ceratids, the above morphogenetic process applies to all members of the Phylloceratina. The tube−shaped structure in the rear part of the body chamber of desmoceratid Damesites consists only of nacreous layer. We interpret it as a pathologically overgrown prochoanitic septal neck.",

The taxo− nomic and palaeoecologic characteristics of molluscan fossil associations from the Goniatite Level are presented. Most of the goniatitids and orthoconic nautiloids from the studied fossil assemblages are juvenile conchs or protoconchs, or incomplete phragmocones and represent the genera Acanthoclymenia and Linguatornoceras, the former being pre− dominant, and a single adult specimen probably of the genus Koenenites. In contrast, gastropods and bivalves are gen− erally well preserved and identifiable to species level. Two new species are described: a gastropod Palaeozygopleura (Bohemozyga) pyritica sp. nov. and a bivalve Glyptohallicardia multicostata sp. nov. These studied molluscs and also amphiporoids are allochthonous elements which must have been transported into the deeper settings during sea−level rise and flooding of fringing reefs (Timan Event) and/or storm events, and there were mixed with pelagic cephalopods. Probably, a sea−level rise even led to flooding of nearby areas, and thus to introduction of pelagic material (juvenile cephalopods) into reefal settings, and then back to the deeper water again by the quasi−estuarine circulation of water masses.",

Exceptionally well−preserved material of this taxon has recently been obtained from a temporary outcrop at an ICE (= InterCityExpress) railway construction site close to Aegidienberg near Bonn. As representatives of Crassirensselaeria have hitherto been included into the terebratulid genus Rhenorensselaeria; they are compared with the two Lower Devonian species of that genus from the Rheinisches Schiefergebirge: Rhenorensselaeria strigiceps and Rh. demerathia. Crassirensselaeria is chiefly distinguished from these by more globular shells, the presence of very strong plications, long and strong dental plates, different ventral muscle field, and thickened cardinalia. Representatives of the new genus are excellent index fossils for the Siegenian of the Rheinisches Schiefergebirge, even in deposits of re− stricted−marine and probably brackish environments. New material of articulated specimens in life position shows that both rhenorensselaeriid genera lived in clusters with the longitudinal axes of the shells oriented steep or perpendicular to the seafloor. The new genus is abundant in the Rheinisches Schiefergebirge (Germany) and the northern Ardennes (Bel− gium), it also occurs in the Hrubý Jesenik Mountains (Czech Republic).

    "abstract": "The taphonomy of the Upper Cretaceous ammonite Anagaudryceras limatum differs from associated ammonites in the same horizon. This differential taphonomy is reconstructed based on fragmentation patterns and structural property of the corrugated shells of their body chamber parts. The characteristic preservation of isolated body chamber parts with corru− gations is commonly observed in A. limatum from the upper Turonian of the Oyubari area, central Hokkaido, Japan. This preservation probably results from the differential internal structural properties of the hollow body chamber and septated phragmocone as well as the peculiar corrugation on body chamber of the present species: (1) fracturing along the corruga− tions against bending force is easier than flat material, because of the concentration of force on the tops or bottoms of cor− rugations, and (2) high durability against compressive forces. The separated body chamber parts were resistant to being squashed and broke into pieces due to the durability of corrugations against compressive force. The statistic test on the fossil assemblage suggests that selective destruction did not affect the fidelity of species composition and relative abun− dance of the studied fossil assemblage. Molluscan death assemblages in marine systems consistently show strong fidelity to relative abundances in the live community, suggesting that there was an Anagaudryceras−dominant ammonoid com− munity during the late Turonian in the Oyubari area.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the phyletic interpretation of the genus Phricodoceras and its taxonomic classification at the subfamily, family, and superfamily levels from an historical and critical perspective.First a review of the latest findings on this taxon is presented and the grounds for the attribution of Phricodoceras to the Schlotheimiidae (Psiloceratoidea) are summarized and illustrated.This review is a synthesis grounded on evolutionary (e.g., heterochronies, innovations), eco-ethological (e.g., assumed shell hydrodynamic capacities) and spatio-temporal patterns (e.g., bio-chronostratigraphy, palaeobiogeography).Then, the main stages of understanding the taxonomy of Phricodoceras since the early nineteenth century are reviewed.Two main taxonomic concepts alternate over time.The first is based on the \"overall resemblance\" of Phricodoceras to some coeval Eoderoceratoidea leading to the genus being included in its own family or subfamily (e.g., Phricodoceratinae) among the Eoderoceratoidea.The second hypothesis, recently confirmed by the discovery of an intermediate form (i.e., Angulaticeras spinosus ), clearly includes Phricodoceras within the Schlotheimiidae (Psiloceratoidea).Comparison of these two very different conceptions reveals how \"overall resemblance\" can be misleading and shows that the discovery of intermediate forms is often the key to phyletic reconstructions in ammonites.",

The phylogenetic information content is therefore not with the character itself, but lies in the relation of any one character to all others known. The principle of total evidence thus emerges as a logical corollary of the distinction of homology and homoplasy, the most severe test of homology involving all known characters in the search for the globally most congruent pattern. In a study combining fossil and extant organisms, however, the issue of missing characters raises the question of implicit a priori weighting, because some sources for characters (soft anatomy, molecular, physiological, behavioral) remain unknown in fossils. The issue of missing data in fossils requires further study before the potential impact of fossils on a classification based on extant organisms can be properly assessed.",

However, even at low speeds a fall would have caused serious injuries. Thus, in accordance to the approach developed in this study, the maximum speed of Giganotosaurus should be not that which will implicate corporal lesions with minimum probability of lethalness. Instead, its maximum speed should be that which would permit the recovery of body equilibrium as each step is taken. Taking into consideration this approach, an indicator of stability is defined for bipedal, cursorial animals. This indicator is determined by the relationship between the time available for the movement of hip joint during the retraction of a hindlimb and the time needed to move the opposite hindlimb by an angle (in function of the speed) of sufficient magnitude as to facilitate the recovery of body equilibrium. This indicator was used to estimate the maximum speed of locomotion of Giganotosaurus (about 14 m s-1) at which, from a kinematic point of view, the danger of falling does not exist.",

The morphology and orientation of the first anal−fin pterygiophore indicate that A. geslini sp. nov. is probably related to the amphi−Atlantic species A. bondi and A. melanum.

The large collection (ca. 60 000 specimens) allowed distinction of several types of these rare disorders (14 specimens), which are il− lustrated by SEM and explanatory drawings. An example of a deformity formed on the pentamerous system is also pre− sented. The deformations develop in the rudiment; consequently the apical system and the test of the mature individual which is formed at its margin display disorders. The anomalies most commonly appear as an additional growth zone (6−ray symmetry), lack of one growth zone (4−ray symmetry), or both deformations simultaneously (changed 5−ray sym− metry). The changes appear in the apical system (number of ocular pores), test (number of petals), and peristome outline. The anomaly linked with the incorrect position of the periproct on the test surface, resulting from the delay of its displace− ment during early ontogenic stages, is characteristic and unique for such deformations.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatocopids are a group of small extinct marine crustaceans, which occur widespread in Cambrian dysoxic benthic lithofacies.Whereas the anatomy of the earliest ontogenetic stages of phosphatocopids, from the head larva with four pairs of appendages onward, is well documented, that of more advanced or adult growth stages has remained almost unknown (except for the external shields).Here we describe a three-dimensionally preserved specimen of a late growth stage of Cyclotron angelini from the Furongian strata (~490 Ma) of northern Poland, which possesses six pairs of appendages (2nd-7th pairs; antennula missing), much of setation, sternum with paragnath humps, and the trunk end with the putative anus.Based on comparisons with known phosphatocopids, the cephalic feeding system of this late larva comprises the antennae with their gnathobase-like median structures on their syncoxa and the mandible with a likewise strong but oblique gnathic coxal endite.Both appendages have a short, specialized endopod bearing a prominent, dentate, stout median spine on its proximal portion.The antennulae are missing but, as in other phosphatocopids, they are not expected to have contributed to the feeding and locomotory system like they do in crustacean stem-lineage representatives and the Eucrustacea, especially in the early larval phase.The lack of an antennal exopod and strong reduction in size of the mandibular exopod of C. angelini suggest that these appendages had lost their function as locomotory and sweeping devices, in contrast to other phosphatocopids (and eucrustaceans).Therefore, they may have served mainly for food gathering in the vicinity of the mouth, which may represent an autapomorphy of this phosphatocopid species.Furthermore, in this developmental stage of C. angelini the production of water currents and movement of food particles toward the median food path was likely achieved by the large, paddle-shaped setiferous exopods of the serially developed post-mandibular limbs.For comparisons, we studied additional phosphatocopid specimens from the Dębki 2 borehole belonging to other taxa and representing different ontogenetic stages.This is also the first report of exceptionally preserved cuticular apodemes in phosphatocopids, extending internally and still bearing partly preserved, putative muscle bundles.As known from extant eucrustaceans, these apodemes most likely served as attachment sites for appendage muscles.",

    "abstract": "Throughout their history, species had to face environmental variations spatially and temporally.How both levels of variation interact will be of key importance in conditioning their response to major perturbations.We addressed this question by focusing on a period in Earth's history marked by dramatic environmental and faunal changes, the Late Devonian Frasnian/Famennian boundary.From a paleogeographic point of view, this period is characterized by a cosmopolitanism of the faunas across a large ocean, the Prototethys.We considered the biotic reaction at a seldom considered scale, namely within a single subgenus of conodont, Palmatolepis (Manticolepis).Patterns of spatial and temporal differentiation were quantified using morphometrics of its platform element.The recognized cosmopolitanism of the faunas was confirmed at this scale of variation since temporal records gathered in distant areas around the Prototethys, including the seldom documented regions located nowadays in South-East Asia, displayed similar morphological trends in response to the major F/F crisis.Beyond this overall cosmopolitanism, subtle geographic structure was evidenced but was not stable through time.Geographic differentiation was maximal shortly before the F/F crisis, suggesting that despite high sea-level, tectonics leaded to complex submarine landscapes promoting differentiation.In contrast any geographic structure was swamped out after the crisis, possibly due to a global recolonization from few favorable patches.",

Examples include individual vertebrae in the vertebral column and teeth in a tooth row.Until an isolated element can be accurately attributed to a specific position within its series, multiple lines of ecological and evolutionary research cannot be conducted.However, varying levels of differentiability between loci, and varying patterns of differentiation across clades, make it impossible to develop a single set of diagnostic traits for any particular set of serial homologues, particularly mammalian molars.Here, we test the utility of a set of classification criteria for distinguishing molar tooth positions of hyraxes (Mammalia, Afrotheria, Hyracoidea), which have been considered indistinguishable in previous taxonomic studies.As part of the test we evaluate the degree to which between-locus variation is conservative in this taxon, which would strengthen the predictive power of proposed traits even in cases where species identity is unknown.Suitable tests for hypotheses of conservatism in categorical traits did not exist, to our knowledge, and we therefore explored the behavior of a previously developed metrics, Borges et al.'s δ, to assess conservatism in contrast to phylogenetic signal produced by Brownian motion.This metric shows some promise but the nature of resulting distributions makes tests difficult to interpret, indicating a line of potential future methods improvement.We used a linear morphometric characterization of shape to validate the candidate traits.In the case of hyracoid molars, relatively simple ratios of linear measurements have strong discriminatory power despite evolutionary variation in between-locus differences.Overall, new or understudied taxa are likely to have lower molar loci differentiable by their relative length and talonid vs. trigonid width.",

    "abstract": "The abundance of shark and actinopterygian fossils in the Cretaceous and Paleogene strata of the Atlantic Coastal Plain is well documented; but much remains unknown about the survivorship patterns of these major components of shallow marine faunas in the western Atlantic through the K/Pg mass extinction.To shed light on this subject, we describe an assemblage of new actinopterygian, chondrichthyan, and reptilian microfossils recently recovered from the Maastrichtian Navesink and Maastrichtian-Danian Hornerstown formations at the Jean and Ric Edelman Fossil Park at Rowan University in Mantua Township, New Jersey.The new microfossils clarify extinction patterns across the K/Pg, create temporal and geographic range extensions for several taxa, and expand the known fauna of this regionally-rare and important K/Pg-boundary locality.We report 11 new additions to the vertebrate fauna of Edelman Fossil Park, the first Paleocene record of Saurocephalus lanciformis, the first Cretaceous records of Paralbula marylandica and Palaeogaleus vincenti , and the first recovery of gar and dercetid fish remains from the Paleocene in New Jersey (the last indicating that these fish survived the K/Pg extinction in the western Atlantic).Geographic range extensions include: Notidanodon brotzeni into the Western Hemisphere, Saurocephalus into northeastern North America and Phyllodus paulkatoi to the eastern coast of North America.A dentary of a juvenile alligatorid, Bottosaurus harlani, indicate that the mandible exhibited isometric growth through ontogeny.Our findings generally agree with other studies that these groups were significantly impacted by the extinction event, that extinctions were selective, and recovery was slow.This wealth of novel insights garnered from microfossils in this study highlights their critical importance for elaborating past faunas and illuminating the character of ancient ecosystems.We therefore recommend microsieving as a fruitful method for future faunal studies of shallow-marine strata and predict that such efforts will frequently yield similar important insights.",

    "abstract": "The hindlimb of pterosaurs has been much less studied than the pterosaur wing.However, it is relevant to understand the evolution, phylogeny and ecology of these animals.This study provides the first complete and detailed description of the ankle of Pterodaustro guinazui.It documents three ontogenetic stages observed for the fusion of the tibiotarsus: in the youngest specimens the proximal tarsals are not fused to the tibia; in the subadults the tibiotarsus is formed, but with the suture still visible; in the adults, the tibiotarsus is entirely formed, without any suture.The fusion between astragalus and calcaneum precedes tibiotarsal fusion, but in close succession.The medial condyle of the tibiotarsus is made up of the astragalus, and the lateral condyle is composed of the calcaneum and part of the astragalus.The distal tibiotarsus has three articular facets, the most medial of which seems to greatly restrict the flexion-extension movement, a feature atypical of pterosaurs.The lateral part of the distal tibiotarsus, on the contrary, allows a very wide range of movement.Pterodaustro guinazui seems to have had an asymmetrical ankle joint, which could facilitate movements linked to wading behavior.We describe juvenile specimens that retain discrete distal tarsals Ⅱ and Ⅲ (common in the \"non-pterodactyloid\" pterosaurs), but also more mature specimens with completely fused distal tarsals Ⅱ and Ⅲ (a condition always observed in the late pterodactyloids).Moreover, the lateral distal tarsal (LDT) appears more robust in Pterodaustro than in Peteinosaurus or Dimorphodon, but shares a waisted shape with these taxa, unlike the more robust shape of the LDT of late pterodacty-loids.The new information on the Pterodaustro ankle improves our anatomical knowledge of the basal Pterodactyloidea.",

Hence, the knowledge of jawed polychaetes of this age is unsatisfactory and represents a gap in our understanding of the Phanerozoic record of the Polychaeta. Nonetheless, many post-Palaeozoic scolecodonts are very similar to those of Recent polychaetes and can be assigned to extant families and genera, and thereby provide information about the phylogeny and evolutionary development of these worms (Szaniawski & Imajima 1996). Polychaete jaws have been discovered during an ongoing palynological study of cuttings from a series of shallow wells from the southwestern part of the Vomb Trough in Skine (Scania), southern Sweden. The boreholes, which penetrated Cretaceous and Jurassic strata, were drilled between the years 1965-90, and sampled by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU). Material from these borings are housed at the Geological Survey Well Archive in Lund. One of the samples, tentatively dated as Coniacian-Santonian in agc based on its dinoflagellate content, yielded an incomplete polychaete jaw apparatus, which strongly resembles previously described Mesozoic forms and is considered to be congeneric with the Recent Ophryotrocha. The specimen is deposited at the Department of Geology, Lund University, Sweden.",

There are three types of domes: individual colonies of Parasmittina collum (Canu and Bassler), individual colonies of Osthimosia glomerata (Gabb and Horn) and multispecies intergrowths. The bryozoans grew later− ally beyond initial shell substrata to become free−lying. P. collum colonies grew by local eruptive budding, forming subcolonies that extended radially over the underlying layer of zooids. Undersides of subcolonies that extended beyond the original substratum have basal exterior walls that are more commonly fouled by encrusters than is the upper side of the colony. By contrast, lateral growth of O. glomerata colonies was limited by size of the original substratum, subcolonies were not developed, and colony growth occurred by prolific frontal budding over the entire upper surface of the colony. Undersides of colonies beyond the substratum consist of the lateral interior walls of marginal zooids and are much less commonly fouled than are undersurfaces of P. collum. The upper surfaces of multispecies domes by definition are always fouled, and their undersurfaces are also commonly fouled.",

    "abstract": "The hitherto poorly known type species of Cyrtosymbole, i.e., Dechenella escoti, is redescribed on the basis of an abun− dant new material recovered from the early Famennian Lower Griotte Limestone Formation at La Touriere, near Cabrieres, southern France. It includes sclerites (hypostome, librigenae, thoracic segments and external surface of the pygidium) that previously were either unknown, or represented by poorly preserved and incomplete specimens, together with a full suite of post−protaspid growth stages. The latter has revealed that certain characters, in particular the preglabellar region and postocular facial sutures, show marked changes between the early and late holaspid stages. In the past, some species have been based on immature specimens; for example the lectotype of C. escoti is an early holaspis, and the characters that it displays have been regarded as diagnostic of the genus. For confident specific assignments in cyrtosymboline trilobites it is important, therefore, to have to hand sufficient material, including late holaspids. A revised diagnosis of Cyrtosymbole is given, and only those species that share diagnostic adult characters with C. escoti are as− signed to it. Insights into early growth development exemplified by C. escoti and allies corroborate the attribution of the Cyrtosymbolinae to the Proetidae.",

Steady and gradual changes in conch morphology of the goniatite lin− eage Phoenixites frechi–Tornoceras subacutum–T. sublentiforme occurred in concert with water shallowing during the deposition of the Lower Famennian cephalopod limestone. Biometric analysis of ammonoid conch and facies analysis of the cephalopod limestones have been applied to assess the possible relationship between shell geometry and envi− ronmental changes. Results show that ratios of whorl width / diameter as well as whorl width / whorl height decreased, while distance from the venter to the greatest whorl width / diameter increased with time, thereby reducing hydrody− namic drag of the shells, probably in response to increasing water turbulence. The interpretation presented here is in agreement with similar cases from the literature. However, this kind of environmentally controlled evolution has hith− erto been recognized only in Jurassic and Cretaceous ammonoids. Conch morphology may be considered as an indica− tor of palaeobathymetry.",

This pattern of septal apparatus is so alien to scleractinians, that, despite a trabecular microstructure of septa resembling that of the Scleractinia, the genus was originally ascribed to a rare group of corals informally referred to as sleractiniamorphs, previ− ously known from the Ordovician and Permian. Genus Furcophyllia emerged together with corals of several groups, after the post−Permian crisis diversification of skeletonized anthozoans, some of them markedly differing in their skeletal fea− tures from typical Scleractinia. So far, the genus was represented by middle Carnian Furcophyllia septafindens from the Dolomites, in the Southern Alps. Here, we report Furcophyllia shaitanica sp. nov. from limestone boulders found in the volcano−clastic deposits of the upper Ladinian Sajtan suite of the South Eastern Pamirs. A new species of Furcophyllia signifies that the genus was a faunal element widely distributed in the Tethys.",

    "abstract": "A new species of the orthide brachiopod genus Kinnella is described from the Upper Member of the Georgian Bay Forma− tion (Upper Ordovician) of Manitoulin Island, Ontario, Canada. This species, herein designated as Kinnella laurentiana sp. nov., occurs in strata of Richmondian (mid−Ashgill; Katian) age, most likely correlative with the eastern North Ameri− can Dicellograptus complanatus Zone. This occurrence extends the known stratigraphic range of Kinnella downward considerably from its previously inferred basal Hirnantian inception. The new species is characterized by a moderately convex dorsal valve and an apsacline ventral interarea rarely approaching catacline. This is the third reported occurrence of Kinnella in North America, and is the only species known to have inhabited the epicontinental seas of Laurentia. The associated benthic shelly fauna indicates a depositional environment within fair weather wave base (BA 2). The ancestry of Kinnella and this species appears most likely to lie among older, morphologically similar members of the Draboviidae which were seemingly confined to higher latitude faunal provinces prior to the Hirnantian glacial event. Thus, the mid−Ashgill occurrence of Kinnella laurentiana in the palaeotropically located Manitoulin Island region suggests the mixing of a probable cooler water taxon with the warmer water epicontinental shelly fauna of Laurentia, as well as a pos− sible earlier episode of low−latitude oceanic cooling. Cluster analysis of Kinnella−bearing brachiopod faunas reveals a sharp differentiation between the K. laurentiana−associated brachiopod fauna and all other known (Hirnantian–lower Rhuddanian) occurrences mainly represented by the type species K. kielanae.",

    "abstract": "We describe a partial skeleton of a small bird from the lower Eocene London Clay of Walton-on-the-Naze (Essex, UK), which shows close affinities to two phylogenetically controversial early Paleogene taxa, Morsoravis sedilis (lower Eocene of Denmark) and Pumiliornis tessellatus (lower/middle Eocene of Germany).Our phylogenetic analysis supports a clade including M. sedilis, P. tessellatus, and the new species, Sororavis solitarius gen.et sp.nov., and this clade is introduced as Morsoravidae fam.nov.Even though morsoravids resulted within crown group Psittacopasseres in our analysis, as the sister taxon of the Zygodactylidae and Passeriformes, they exhibit a presumably plesiomorphic tarsometatarsus morphology unlike that of zygodactyl psittacopasserines.The elongate tarsometatarsus of S. solitarius shows a resemblance to that of extant mousebirds (Coliiformes) and has a large trochlea for the second toe, which bears an extensive trochlear furrow.This distinctive foot morphology is likely to represent an adaptation for a grasping foot and may indicate a locomotory behaviour similar to that of mousebirds, which are arboreal acrobats that forage in the foliage of trees and shrubs.Since the Psittacopasseres and the Coliiformes are widely separated in current phylogenies, the \"mousebird-like\" tarsometatarsus of the new species represents a notable instance of convergent evolution in small arboreal birds.",

    "abstract": "The rare Middle Jurassic ammonite Oecoptychius refractus is revisited based on material collected in southern Poland (Ogrodzieniec quarry) and France (St.-Laon near Loudun, western France).Based on available data and an evaluation of the literature, O. refractus ranges from the middle Callovian Kosmoceras jason Zone to the upper Callovian Quenstedtoceras lamberti Zone.Additionally, two specimens from Kachchh (western India) were re-evaluated and are now assigned to the lower part of the upper Callovian Peltoceras athleta Zone, similar to specimens from southern Germany.In the present study, O. refractus displays large morphological variation in the shape of the body-chamber, with a gradation from V-to U-shape.Additionally, the smaller upper Callovian specimens from Poland are morphologically closer to the lectotype (more evolute and compressed) and form a separate grouping as compared to the much larger middle Callovian specimens from France.Based on available data, the authors tentatively propose Phlycticeras polygonium var.waageni [M] as the dimorphic partner of O. refractus [m]; both dimorphs have similar morphology (ribbing pattern and striations), suture line and co-occur from middle to upper Callovian.Oecoptychius refractus maintains its morphological variability throughout the middle and upper Callovian, before its final dissapearance in the Q. lamberti Zone.Oecoptychius refractus is better documented from western Tethyan localities (Poland, Germany and France) as compared to those from the eastern Tethys (Madagascar and India).Recurrent sea level rises in the Middle Jurassic might be one of the plausible factors for its extensive palaeobiogeographic range.",

    "abstract": "We describe Gastrocopta sandbergeri sp. nov. from the Miocene brown coal deposits of the open−cast mine Belchatow (central Poland) and identify it as conspecific with Pupa (Vertigo) suevica Sandberger, 1875 (nomen nudum) from the Miocene of Steinheim. The new name “sandbergeri” has been introduced in substitution because Sandberger’s name “suevica” has been later proposed again for a valid species Gastrocopta (Albinula) suevica by Boettger (1889). We could not use the name “minor” proposed by Miller (1900) as form of Pupa (Leucochilus) suevica because it is preoccupied by another Gastrocopta species: Bifidaria ashmuni f. minor Sterki, 1898 [= Gastrocopta ashmuni (Sterki, 1898)]. In conse− quence Sandberger’s Pupa (Vertigo) suevica is recognized as the senior synonym of Gastrocopta sandbergeri sp. nov. The new species is most similar to Gastrocopta nouletiana (Dupuy, 1850) but differs in having smaller and always slen− der shell, less convex whorls, much weaker crest on the body whorl (or even absent) and generally rather weakly developed teeth (6–7) in the aperture.",

The foraminiferal fauna from the Upper Montian of the Crimea is taken as an example and compar­ ed with that of other parts of Europe. Most of the 33 species distinguished, including 3 new ones, represent stenothermal forms, analogous to those occurring in the Mon­ tian stratotype of Belgium (Puits Goffin). The geographical range of the Meridional Province, which stretches from the Pyrenees up to the Crimea in the form of an arc parallel to the northern margin of the Alpes and Carpathians, has been traced more accurately. The directions of the migration of foraminiferal faunas, within the Meridional Province whose cradle should be looked for as early as in the Upper Maastrichtian in the Belgian-Dutch basin, have been determined. These faunas reached France and West Germany in the early Montian, East Germany and Po­ land in the somewhat later Montian and the Crimea in the uppermost Montian. That was also the region ,in which the duration of a warm sea with tropical fauna was the shortest.",

    "abstract": "Fifteen bryozoan species belonging to thirteen genera have been identified from an outcrop of the Picos de Europa Forma− tion (Moscovian, Upper Carboniferous) at La Hermida in northern Spain. Three species and one genus are new— Coscinium hermidensis sp. nov., Cystodictya pustulosa sp. nov., and Cystocladia hispanica gen. et sp. nov. Rhabdomesid bryozoans are the most diverse order with seven species, followed by cystoporids (four species), fenestellids (three spe− cies) and trepostomids (one species). Bryozoans with erect branched or reticulate colonies dominate in the studied assem− blage; only two species possess encrusting colonies. Together with associated crinoids, the bryozoan assemblage indi− cates a subtidal environment below the zone of vigorous water movement. The La Hermida bryozoan fauna confirms the Upper Carboniferous age of the Picos de Europa Formation and allows various biogeographical interpretations. All previ− ously known species of the genus Coscinium were reported from the Lower Permian of Russia. Clausotrypa monticola is known from the Lower Permian of Russia and Arctic as well as from the Upper Carboniferous of Carnic Alps (Austria). Rhabdomeson cf. propatulissimum and Penniretepora pseudotrilineata are known from the same level of Italian Carnic Alps. Streblotrypa (Streblascopora) nikiforovae and Rhombocladia punctata are known from the Upper Carboniferous (Moscovian) of Ukraine. Fistulipora petaloida is known from Kasimovian Stage of Russian Plate. Several other species show connections with North America.",

The oldest (very Late Eocene/Oligocene) representatives of Galeodinopsis, G. biangulata, and G. semperi, share similar shell shape and microsculpture with Alvinia. This suggests that Galeodinopsis originated from some Eocene species related to Alvinia. The new species represents the first occurrence within Galeodinopsis of a combination of characters very close to those of Manzonia, above all the typical pitted microsculpture.

The term organism community is of a very general nature and embraces co-incidental or necessary, permanent or temporary associations of organisms. Lately it is being linked to paleoecological statements more often (Paporte 1977), which gives it a sociological and ecological meaning. This is theoretically justified, because only differentiated ecological factors lead to typical coral communities being formed. However, such coral communities are not co-incidental, but regulated by certain laws of environmental conditions, they are not temporary, but permanent phenomena; particularly when environmental conditions are reconstructable and used for a description of the habitats, does it appear advisable to use the well-defined term association.",

    "abstract": "The study of pristine preserved shells of Mesozoic Ammonoidea shows different types of construction and formation of the dorsal shell wall.We observe three major types: (i) The vast majority of Ammonoidea, usually planispirally coiled, has a prismatic reduced dorsal shell wall which consists of an outer organic component (e.g., wrinkle layer), which is the first layer to be formed, and the subsequently formed dorsal inner prismatic layer.The dorsal mantle tissue suppresses the formation of the outer prismatic layer and nacreous layer.With the exception of the outer organic component, secretion of a shell wall is omitted at the aperture.A prismatic reduced dorsal shell wall is always secreted immediately after the hatching during early teleoconch formation.Due to its broad distribution in (planispiral) Ammonoidea, the prismatic reduced dorsal shell wall is probably the general state.(ii) Some planispirally coiled Ammonoidea have a nacreous reduced dorsal shell wall which consists of three mineralized layers: two prismatic layers (primary and secondary dorsal inner prismatic layer) and an enclosed nacreous layer (secondary dorsal nacreous layer).The dorsal shell wall is omitted at the aperture and was secreted in the rear living chamber.Its layers are a continuation of an umbilical shell doubling (reinforcement by additional shell layers) that extends towards the ventral crest of the preceding whorl.The nacreous reduced dorsal shell wall is formed in the process of ontogeny following a prismatic reduced dorsal shell wall.(iii) Heteromorph and some planispirally coiled taxa secrete a complete dorsal shell wall which forms a continuation of the ventral and lateral shell layers.It is formed during ontogeny following a prismatic reduced dorsal shell wall or a priori.The construction is identical with the ventral and lateral shell wall, including a dorsal nacreous layer.The wide distribution of the ability to form dorsal nacre indicates that it is a plesiomorphic trait which either was passed on from gyrocone ammonoid ancestors or (re-)developed in post-Triassic ammonoids.",

Morganucodontans are a rare component of Late Jurassic faunas but display surprising dental diversity through variations in a tooth count and cusp morphology of a deeply conserved, generalized mammalian tooth pattern, which was fully established in brasilodontid (non-mammalian) ancestors at least 80 my prior.",

Its foliage consists of dichotomously branched pinnate to tripinnate fronds, sphenopteroid pinnules and intercalary pinnae and pinnules. The foliage is very variable. Immature, semi-mature, and mature pinnae and pinnules are known. These plants grew probably along the margins of floodplain lakes.

Observations of the holotype's fine anatomical characters have been facilitated by the use of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI), an emerging method for the visualization of compression and impression fossils. Considering that the estimated age of the Redmond Formation is theCenomanian (Late Cretaceous), the discovery of M. blaisi contributes to a very recent expansion of the tettigarctid fossil record that fills a gap between Early Cretaceous and Cenozoic genera.It suggests that hairy cicadas maintained a global distribution and thrived in a variety of climate regimes well into the Late Cretaceous, and that their competitive exclusion by singing cicadas occurred definitely closer to the end of the Cretaceous, or even during the Cenozoic.This discovery is only the start of a thorough description of the recently expanded entomofauna in the Cretaceous of Labrador.",

    "abstract": "Although the fossil record of beaked whales (Cetacea, Odontoceti, Ziphiidae) is continuously improving, the geological age of new taxa is often poorly constrained.Based on a partial cranium from deep seafloor deposits off Galicia, Spain, we describe a new species of the stem beaked whale genus Beneziphius, B. cetariensis sp.nov.The latter differs from the type species B. brevirostris in the larger size, the rostrum being proportionally longer, the premaxillae being longer than the maxillae at the apex of the rostrum, the left premaxillary sac fossa being transversely concave, and the ascending process of the premaxilla reaching the vertical.Considering that the stratigraphic context of deep-sea deposits off the Iberian Peninsula is not precisely known, we provisionally propose an extended, middle Miocene to early Pliocene interval for the geological age of B. cetariensis.Nonetheless, the palynological analysis of sediment sampled from cavities in the cranium of the holotype of B. brevirostris, discovered during the second part of the nineteenth century in inland deposits of Antwerp (north of Belgium), yield an early to mid-Serravallian age (13.2-12.8Ma, late middle Miocene).B. brevirostris is thus the oldest described species of the \"Messapicetus clade\", a large clade of stem ziphiids in which most species are dated from the late Miocene.The description of the Galician species B. cetariensis broadens the biogeographic distribution of Beneziphius and confirms the strong ziphiid faunal affinities between the eastern coast of the North Atlantic and the southern margin of the North Sea Basin.",

Its distinctive morphology appears to be the result of an adaptation towards illaenid life habits. The pygidial morphology, with the extra-fulcral field developed as segmental pleural spines, makes an assignment possible to only four Ordovician groups, namely the Remopleuridioidea, Odontopleuroidea, Lichoidea and Cheiruroidea. Of these, the former three are so different that a direct affiliation is out of the question. Similarities with the Cheiruroidea are the more persuasive, particularly after a misinterpretation of the facial suture is corrected and some other problems are sorted out. It is suggested that the Holotrachelinae are placed within the Cheiruridae, where it may have special affinities to the Sphaerexochinae.",

Two specimens of graptoblasts, which provisionally may be assigned to 'Graptoblasto- ides' sp. and 'Graptoblastus' sp., are described from the early Llandovery of Anticosti Is- land (Qukbec, Canada). Previous reports of Silurian graptoblasts were restricted to a sin- gle specimen from Poland. One of the new specimens is morphologically distinct from all known graptoblasts - both chambers of the inner cavity contain numerous incomplete septae, here referred to as hemiseptae. SEM observations show distinct two-layered char- acter of the transverse septum, whereas the hemiseptae show no trace of layering. Hemiseptae and the transverse septum are derivatives of the inner lining of the grapto- blast. The 'genera' Graptoblastus Kozlowski, 1949 and Graptoblastoides Kozlowski, 1949 are interpreted as stages in graptoblast development, and are consequently replaced by the purely descriptive terms 'graptoblastus' and 'graptoblastoides'. The following stages of graptoblast development are recognized: (1) pre-graptoblastoides stage, (2) early graptoblastoides stage,",

    "abstract": "A long history preceded the publication of two papers (Alvarez et al. 1980; Smit and Hertogen 1980) on a hypothesis that was to change the way we think about mass extinctions. The idea of a ma− jor impact ending the reign of the dinosaurs had been launched earlier, albeit without a scrap of evidence. Many other hypotheses had been put forward and had fared no better by lack of supporting data. De Laubenfels (1956) introduced “one more hypothesis”, a meteorite impact, and suggested that the heat flash had killed off the dinosaurs. The problem with this and other hypotheses (i.e., diseases, egg predation, pituitary gland anomalies, oversize, over− specialisation, magnetic reversal, sea level changes, etc.) is that they account for only small group of (generally) terrestrial verte− brates, but that they do not explain the simultaneous extinction of marine life. De Laubenfels’s impact idea was inspired by the proximity in 1937 and 1941 of the 1km−sized asteroid Hermes, at only 1,6 times the Earth−Moon distance. He even estimated the frequency of large, 10 km−sized planetesimal collisions correctly: about 2–3 such impacts during the Phanerozoic, a number subsequently con− firmed by better observations and statistics (Dachille 1977; Grieve et al. 1995). Nobel laureate Harold Urey suggested in 1973 that geologists should be on the lookout for (micro)tektites at geological bound− aries, especially at the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary, but failed to find them (Urey 1973). Christensen et al. (1973) ana− lysed in detail the Stevns Klint K/Pg boundary clay by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and found anomalously high concentrations of Cr and Ni. However, further than a comparison with anaerobic black shale enrichments they did not go, although the enrichments were much greater than those in black shales. In the 1960s we learned from Professor H.A. Brouwer (per− sonal communication 1969) that the craters on the moon might be volcanic. In our petrology classes we were taught that the Sudbury igneous body was a volcanic lopolith (Lowman 1992) and O’Keefe (1976) believed that tektites could be produced by lunar volcanoes. The Apollo lunar missions changed all that and generated detailed research of impacts and meteorites. Urey (1957), Shoemaker (1963) and others convincingly demon− strated that both the Moon and the Earth were saturated with im− pact craters, but that those on the Earth were largely eroded away. Impacts slowly came to be seen as “a matter of fact” in the geological record. In the early 1960s, in particular in the Chicago Fermi labora− tories, the analytical technique of Neutron Activation (INAA) (developed by George de Hevesy) was used for the detection of many trace elements, in particular iridium. Barker and Anders (1968) and Crocket and Kuo (1979) used this technique to esti− mate the accretion rate of cosmic matter. They could apply this estimate because it had previously been discovered that iridium in cosmic matter (meteorites) was orders of magnitude more abundant than in terrestrial crustal materials (~500 versus 0.02 ng/g). Iridium is a special element in INAA. It has a relatively large “neutron capture cross section”, which means that Ir ab− sorbs easily a neutron to become the radioactive isotope Ir. This Ir decays with a half life of 74 days emitting two easily identifiable gamma rays of 316 and 468 kev energy. Therefore, among the Platinum Group Elements (PGE), it is by far the easi− est to identify.",

Because of their strongly everted calices and a corresponding arrangement of trabeculae, the colonies of the genus Cantabriastraea are assigned tentatively to the Paradisphyllinae, constituting the first record of the subfamily in Western Europe. Some specimens give information on colony−formation of this taxon, which is induced by strong lateral budding (nonparricidal increase) of a remarkable large and long−lasting protocorallite.",

Its depth was about a few metres and the water level suffered periodic fluctuations.This new locality sheds light on the palaeoenvironmental dynamics of the Ribesalbes-Alcora Basin during the early Miocene and provides a new approach to the palaeoecological reconstruction of the basin.",

Historically, the morphology and anatomical relationships of these distal tarsals is uncertain in ornithomimosaurs due to loss and/or disarticulation; even in articulated specimens, the bones can be difficult to access.A previously undescribed ornithomimid fossil from the Kaiparowits Formation (upper Campanian) of southern Utah, USA, provides unique views of the distal tarsals in articulation with their surrounding elements, allowing the most complete assessment yet of this region in an ornithomimid from North America.Distal tarsal 3 contacts both metatarsals II and III, whereas distal tarsal 4 contacts only metatarsal IV.Distal tarsal 4 also shows a tab-like process that projects laterally.Comparison of the new fossil with other ornithomimosaurs shows that distal tarsals in Ornithomimosauria can be generalized as: (i) paired as distal tarsals 3 and 4; (ii) not fused to one another or to the proximal metatarsus; and (iii) proximo-distally compressed.The distal tarsals of ornithomimosaurs vary in the antero-posterior positioning and extent to which they cover the proximal metatarsal surface.",

Its elongated, bottle-shaped or subconical thecae, interpreted as autothecae, are differentiated into a broader proximal part (camara), provided with a convex, rarely flat, bottom, and a narrower distal one (collum), devoid of any kind of apertural processes. The wall of the fossil is made of the fusellar tissue; irregularly distributed oblique sutures of fuselli are not arranged in a zigzag line. A sudden change of fuselli width leading to an appearence of the microfusellar tissue is sometimes observed in the distal part of the tube. The presence of primitive cortex (paracortex? pseudocortex?) is suggested. Robust, elongated vesicles are found inside two autothecae and interpreted as a dormant structure, tentatively compared with cysts of crustoid graptolites or a blastocrypt of graptoblasts. Its upper wall is situated between the camara and collum and looks like a sclerotized diaphragm described in other camaroids. The fossil unites certain characters of cephalodiscid pterobranchs and camaroid graptolites but is not interpreted as truly transient link between these two hemichordate groups.",

Then the permanent double-walled colony organization developed along the colony margin (Flabellotrypa-like). In the following evolutionary stage, the external wall was secreted only at the conical creeping stage immediately following ancestrula (typical rhabdomesines). With subsequent evolution the external wall completely disappeared, and the double-walled ancestrula grew vertically (advanced rhabdomesines and phylloporinids).

The Chinese specimens have reticulate ornament and a large asymmetrical aviculopectinid-type resilifer and are much like Girtypecten from Permian rocks in the United States. However, the Chinese material shows only unicostate radial ornament, whereas Girtypecten is multicostate. Thus, a new taxon Girtypecten (Sinopecten) newelli subgen. et sp. nov. is proposed. The conodont assemblage occurring with G. (Sinopecten) newelli dates the new scallop as Tournaisian (the conodont Lower Siphonodella crenulata Zone); this is the oldest known occurrence of Girtypecten.",

    "abstract": "Transmission electron microscope investigation of ultrathin microtomesections of graptoloid graptolite periderm forming nema and virgula walls in a didymograptid, an orthograptid, and monograptids indicates that these structures had certain similarities as well as differences in ultrastructure. Similarities include: An internal canal that is partly hollow and partiy filled with loosely woven fibrous material, layered walls, layers in the walls formed of electron dense, homogenous sheet fabric bounding compact fabric formed of densely-packed fibrils; and holes: or vesicles that perforate the compact fabric. Two aspects of colony growth may be recognized among graptolites. One is: extension of those tissues related to nema or virgula formation, and the other is zooidal budding. The two growth aspects appear to be little, if at all, related in didymograptids and other graptolites with a nema. They mayor may not be related in orthograptids and other biserial scandent graptolites. Study of peridermal ultrastructure suggests that they 'may have been closely related in monograptids because the outer layers of the virgula wall develop into thecal wall growth increments. Graptolite colonies, particularly uniseriaI graptolites, resemble physonectid siphonophores in certain gross morphological aspects as well as in having two similar aspects of colony growth. Physonectid colonies are highly integrated. Physonectids may provide a model for use in suggesting potential graptolite colony function and degree of colony integration. The close relationship between the two growth aspects, in rponograptids suggests that they could have been the most highly integrated graptolite colonies. Members of the colony may have acted together to generate efficient flow of water currents past the zooids for feeding and waste disposal. Perhaps, too, tissues related to virgula development were connected with buoyancy and mobility, by analogy with the functiqns of the physonectid nectosome. Inasmuch as uniserial graptolites essentially replaced piserials, and the biseI:ials replaced many graptolites with a nema, these developmental steps may have been those leading toward increasingly greater degrees of colony integration. Ultrastructural studies thus may provide insights into not only colony function and integration, but also into graptolite evolutionary adaptive strategy.",

    "abstract": "Investigations of the Late Devonian successions have provided a great deal of evidence to support the hypothesis that the biospheric turning point near the Frasnian–Famennian (F–F) boundary was one of the most significant in Phanerozoic time. Considerable attention and debate have been focused on deter− mining the cause(s) of these biocrises, and various mechanisms have been proposed for the extinction of a wide range of benthic, primarily low−latitude stromatoporoid−coral reefs, and pelagic organisms. The widely recognized stepwise pattern of extinc− tion in major fossil groups in the late Frasnian argues against a single catastrophic (“bedding−plane”) mass killings of biota at the end of the Frasnian (see concept of a prolonged Kellwasser [KW] Crisis; Schindler 1993). However, many aspects of this major biotic turning point remain conjectural, including timing and magnitude of ecosystem changes and mediated extinction dynamics. The overall biotic succession is far from reliably doc− umented. Among the better known pelagic faunas, a conodont near−extinction and goniatite crisis are traditionally fixed pre− cisely at the F–F boundary.",

    "abstract": "Late Ordovician graptolites are commonest in the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales, occurring in sediments which are either folded into complex structures or else interrupted by massive thickness of volcanics and associated with frequent facies changes. Thus it has not been possible to construct a series of zones which have either continuity or an established order of appearance. Present knowledge also suggests that differences occur between coeval faunas from volcanic and no-volcanic strata. Silurian graptolites are most common and best preserved in New South Wales. The full sequence of graptolite zones devised in Britain cannot be recognized in Australia. This can be explained partly on failure of outcrop, and partly upon regional hiatuses. The most continuous Llandovery sequences are in areas with a widespread cover of Cainozoic volcanics and gravels. Nonetheless, the Llandovery zones so far recognized, principally cyphus-gregarius and tutrriculatus-crispus, are very wide-spread and occur in differing environments, so that non-representation of zones cannot be attributed wholly to collecting failure. These zones are among those most readily recognized throughout the world, which probably results from their being based upon distinct, easily identified species, and their comparatively long duration. The Wenlock zones are those most poorly represented, this being the part of the Silurian in New South Wales and eastern Victoria most affected by orogenic activity. In areas of central Victoria where sedimentation is believed to have been continuous throughout the Wenlock, the sediments have suffered extensive bioturbation and graptolites are absent. In addition, the extreme rarily of Cyrtograptus means that it is often very difficult to tie an assemblage with an overall Wenlock aspect to any particular zone. The Late Silurian graptolites are those which are most widely distributed, and it has been possible to recognize most of the zones described from the Ludlow and Pridoli of Europe. Sedimentary sequences which cross the Siluro-Devonian boundary are common, but graptolites In Early Devonian strata are frequently in isolated beds separated by great thickness of non-graptolitic strata.",

Currently available methods of correlation are not precise enough to test the first element of these hypotheses. Patterns of mammalian extinction and survival in northeastern Montana, USA as well as records of other organisms argue against the second element. In Montana most of the lineages of marsupials were decimated. Extinction of multitubercurates was not as severe, while only one lineage of eutherians appears to have become extinct. Groups that apparently immigrated into northeastern Montana just prior to the end of the Cretaceous had a greater probability of survival than the residents. The probability of extinction was independent of individual body size. Different patterns of mammalian extinction in different environments also appear to defy explanation in terms of one common, catastrophic causal factor.",

It is suggested that these characters reflect the adaptation to particular feeding habits. A new kind of Givetian echinoid teeth, closely related to the oligolamellar one is described.

Autochthonous fossils in the Fruitland Formation represent organisms of the trophically-complex Parasaurolophus community. Differences in diversity, physical stress and life-history strategies within the Parasaurolophus community fit well the stability-time hypothesis. Thus, dinosaurs experienced relatively low physical stress whereas fishes, amphibians, small reptiles and mammals experienced greater physical stress. Because of this, dinosaurs were less likely to recover from an environmental catastrophe than were smaller contemporaneous vertebrates. The terminal Cretaceous extinctions selectively eliminated animals that lived in less physlcally-stressed situations, indicating that the extinctions resulted from an environmental catastrophe.",

Revised taxonomy of this genus is based on analysis of over 20 numerical characters measured in sections and/or extracted from the literature data. Species are distin− guished either by morphometric non−overlap in at least one, key feature or by geographic–stratigraphic isolation. The ear− liest possible representatives of the genus are known from the Eifelian of Angara (S.? emendatus and S.? russakovi). In the Upper Frasnian Smithicyathus is represented by seven species; in western Euramerica occur S. cinctus and S. mcleani sp. nov.; south−eastern Euramerican shelf area is with S. lacunosus, S. cf. lacunosus, S. smithi, S. cf. smithi, and S. lubli− niensis; one probable species is recorded in Angara: S.? belkovskiense. The genus did not survive the Frasnian– Famennian crisis. Smithicyathus lived in tropical and sub−tropical shallow−marine carbonate environments, with the pos− sible exception of the northern mid−latitudes species from Siberia. In the Holy Cross Mountains, S. lacunosus and S. smithi show a preference for restricted−marine facies. They may make up over 90% of all rugosan colonies collected in such locations, whereas in the more open−marine settings they are rare both in numbers and in proportion to other rugosan species.",

The genus is represented by the type species, T. verneuilanum Milne-Edwards and Haime, and the informal taxon T. sp. 1, which are known only from Tournaisian (early Osagean) strata in Kentucky and Indiana, USA. Previously published records of Trochophyllum outside the type locality of its type species are either invalid or unconfirmable on present published information Trochophyllum is distinguished by a highly variable aulos that is typically of the stereotheca-type, filled with stereoplasm at maturity; axial tabulae absent or not preserved at maturity; cardinal septum shortened in the calice; and minor septa developed only as foundations.",

Lotagnostus? mystacinus Tjernvik, 1953 is a rare agnostid from the Upper Cambrian Agnostus pisiformis Zone of south-central Sweden. It is redescribed following examination of the holotype and an additional pygidium. The outline and morphology of especially the pygidial posteroaxis, which is distinctly trilobate by a pair of deep notular furrows, suggest that the species is best classified as a species of Lotagnostus.

Schouppe, 1958, with a type genus Macgeea Webster, 1889, mostly singular, very seldom as massive colonies, similarly as in Marisastridae, have the epitheca and horse-shoes which are lacking in the new family; 2) The Phillipsastraeidae (Roemer, 1883) sensu Schouppe, 1958, includes forms with massive colonies and have the pseudotheca, which disappears in some places and, therefore, a tendency is here shown to integration of the colony. Two groups of species have been distinguished among them: a) genus d 'Orbigny, 1849 with its type species Astraea hennahi Lonsdale, 1840, having the pseudotheca and horse-shoes, which are situated on the boundary between the tabularium and dissepimentarium, b) genus Phillipsastraea of most authors, including such species as P . pentagona (Goldfuss) and P. goldfussi (de Verneuil & Haime). This group has the pseudotheca, but has not the horse-shoes. Accordingly, there is no family among the Phillipsastraeacea in which the new genus Marisastrum with massive colonies, as well as singular forms, assigned to Ceratophyllum Gurich, 1896, might be included.",

So far these rather poorly known graptolites of significant phylogenetic importance have been reported from the upper Arenigian or lower Llanvirnian (Kozlowski 1962) to the upper Ludlow (Mierzejewski 1977). Isolated fragments of the graptolite stolon system were chemically ex− tracted from upper Tremadocian chert nodules from Wy− soczki (Holy CrossMountains, central Poland) and examined with SEM. Because of the characteristic trifurcation and fine annulation of the stolons they are recognized as remnants of the crustoid graptolites. This discovery extends the strati− graphic distribution of the crustoid graptolites and explains the enigmatic presence of graptoblasts in the upper Trema− docian beds of Wysoczki.",

    "abstract": "The South African Early Jurassic morganucodontan Erythrotherium is considered by some authors to be potentially synonymous with Morganucodon, due to similar tooth morphology.However, despite their similar dental morphology, the occlusal pattern of Erythrotherium parringtoni has been described as embrasure occlusion, close to the mode of Megazostrodon rudnerae , rather than that of Morganucodon.In this study the molars of Erythrotherium were re-examined and the two alternative occlusal hypotheses were tested using the Occlusal Fingerprint Analyser (OFA).Morphological comparison of the molars of Erythrotherium parringtoni to those of Morganucodon watsoni showed similarities in cusp height and shape in lingual/buccal views, but the molars and individual cusps of Erythrotherium parringtoni are considerably narrower linguo-buccally, and more gracile.With cusps a and c close together in Erythrotherium parringtoni, cusp positioning differs from that of Morganucodon watsoni and shows similarities to the pattern in Megazostrodon rudnerae.Also, the upper molars of Erythrotherium parringtoni are aligned in a straight row and lack the angle, relative to the longitudinal axis, between the first and second upper molars that is present in Morganucodon watsoni .This results in embrasure occlusion being the only viable occlusal mode for Erythrotherium parringtoni , which was confirmed by the OFA analysis.A Morganucodon-like occlusion would allow only the main cusps a/A to contact their antagonists and thus major gaps would be present, causing considerable reduction of functionality of the dentition.Based on the morphological evidence and the differing occlusal mode, the perpetuation of Erythrotherium parringtoni as a separate genus is confirmed.",

If predacious dinosaurs were endothermic, microvertebrate coprocoenoses produced by them should reflect this. Ectothermic warm-bloodedness in dinosaurs could have resulted from high ambient temperatures, at least during the Cretaceous. An eleva ted body temperature in reptiles may be more important for digestion than for levels of activity. A short-term lowering of temperatures at the end of the Cretaceous could have induced digestive failure in reptiles, without affecting other physiological activities.

( 2010)-the two most relevant works on the subject.These would have been glaring omissions had we not done so.",

The Middle to Late Ordovician receptaculitid F'isherites retfculatus (Owen 1844) is the most abundant and widespread receptaculitid known, and yet existing descriptions of its morphology do not reach the level of detail achieved in recent studies of other receptaculitid taxa. We present a redescription of the morphology of individual meroms and of the entire thallus, focusing on gradients in merom number and shape. We document positional information not with distance or angular measurements, but in terms of units of organization of the thallus itself, the number of merom sites from a reference pole. Although more labor intensive, this more accurately portrays thallus symmetry and yields a characterization of form that more directly reflects the developmental program of the organism.",

These two approaches are employed here to elucidate the existence of a regularly ticking ribosomal DNA clock in diatoms and in the vertebrate clade composed of the Actinistia and Tetrapoda. The results obtained from the relative-rate test and the paleontological information are contradictory. The former suggests that the vertebrates diverged at a significantly higher molecular rate than diatoms while the latter indicates that the diatom lineages evolved at about a speed 4.5 fold higher than the Actinistia-Tetrapoda clade. Possible causes of this paradox are discussed. It is concluded that each of these two approaches suffers from weaknesses of its own and that the absolute divergence rates are more reliable than those derived from the relative-rate test.",

    "abstract": "The \"condylarth\" genus Hyopsodus is diverse and abundantly represented in Eocene mammalian faunas of North America.In contrast, fossil specimens of Hyopsodus are rather sparse in Eurasia.Only four species of Hyopsodus are known from Asia and two from Europe, as compared to the 17 species of Hyopsodus described from North America.Here, we report a new species of Hyopsodus, Hyopsodus arshantensis sp.nov., from the middle part of the Arshanto Formation in the Erlian Basin, Inner Mongolia, China.The holotype and only specimen of the new species, a right mandible with m1-m2, exhibits a unique combination of characters on m1-m2 not present in other species of Hyopsodus, including a moderately lophodont crown, a long trigonid without a paraconid, an obliquely aligned protolophid, an angle between the cristid obliqua and the posthypocristid slightly greater than 90°, a midline position of the hypoconulid, and a relatively large entoconid.The m1-m2 morphology of H. arshantensis arshantensis is intermediate between specimens of Hyopsodus from the Wasatchian and Uintan North American Land Mammal Ages (NALMA), and is comparable to that of Hyopsodus from the Bridgerian NALMA.Moreover, its relatively large size is near the size range present among specimens of the late Bridgerian H. marshi.Based on those similarities, in combination with a few fossil mammals from overlying layers, the middle part of the Arshanto Formation could be correlated in part to the late Bridgerian, and the upper part of the Arshanto Formation may bracket the time interval equivalent to the Bridgerian/Uintan boundary.That proposed correlation and somewhat different faunas recognized within the Arshanto Formation suggest that it may be necessary to subdivide the Arshantan Asian Land Mammal Age (ALMA) and/or redefine the Arshantan/Irdinmanhan ALMA boundary in future comprehensive studies.",

In doing so the author adopted the division of the process of anthropogenesis into four evolutionary phases, i.e. Pithecanthropus, Homo neanderthalensis, H. sapiens fossilis and H. sapiens recens. Close investigation of the calculated data revealed velocities of specialized traits changes in the skull of Hominidae to increase with the lapse of time and to attain their maximum in the phase of Homo sapiens fossilis and that of H. sapiens recens.",

In contrast to Kirk's (1975) opinion that graptoloid colonies can be thought of as a kind of superindividual, a view is advanced that most of morphogenetic functions were delegated to particular zooids. The share of common colonial struotures is too small to consider graptoloid colonies as single individuals. Irregular and localized secretion speaks against the concept of rhabdosome being a preciselly controlled counting device.",

    "abstract": "Colour reconstructions have provided new insights into the lives of dinosaurs and other extinct animals, by predicting colouration patterns from fossilised pigment-bearing organelles called melanosomes.Although these methods have become increasingly popular, only a small number of dinosaurs have been studied using these techniques, which require exceptional preservation of fossil feathers, leaving open key questions such as whether dinosaurs changed their plumage patterns during ontogeny.Here we reconstruct the feather colouration of an approximately one-year-old individual of the Early Cretaceous dromaeosaurid theropod Wulong bohaiensis, which to our knowledge is the first unequivocal juvenile paravian for which aspects of the original colour has been predicted.Using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) on the most comprehensive available datasets, we find strong evidence for iridescent plumage of the forelimb and hindlimb remiges and grey plumage on other portions of the body.This suggests that some juvenile paravians used shiny iridescent feathers for signalling purposes, possibly even before reaching somatic or sexual maturity, and thus we can conclude that this paravian used iridescent signalling for intraspecific communication other than sexual signalling.Finally, our results show that when analysing fossil datasets that are entirely comprised of solid and cylindrical melanosomes QDA consistently outperforms MLR, providing more accurate and higher classification probability colour predictions.",

    "abstract": "Floian, Early Ordovician trilobites are systematically described and revised based on new material from the middle part of the Duoquanshan Formation of the Shihuigou area, northern Qinghai Province, northwest China.The fauna that lived on the shallow-water carbonate platform comprises three species belonging to two families, i.e., Tsaidamaspis diarmatus, Zhiyia tsinghaiensis, and Liexiaspis sp.indeterminate.It exhibits a strong endemicity to the Olongbluk terrane.The new isoteline genus Zhiyia is established on the basis of the material from the Olongbluk terrane and South China palaeoplate, and is characterized by its: (i) almost obsolete cephalic and pygidial axial furrows; (ii) flattened anterior border and narrow (sag., exsag.)occipital ring; (iii) bilobed hypostome with a shallow median notch and a small triangular median projection; (iv) subsemicircular pygidium with wide pygidial axis and border.Faunal evidence indicates that the palaeogeographic position of the Olongbluk terrane may have been situated closer to the South China palaeoplate rather than the North China palaeoplate during the Floian.",

The most distal of th ese is probably the last molar. The molariform teeth are single rooted, while their crowns, although essentially single-cusped, have some resemblance to those of small contemporaneous true mammals of the family Morganucodontidae. The affinities of this animal are discussed in the paper, and it is suggested that there was an extensive fauna of small animals in the latest Triassic and earliest Jurassic, which although reptiles, had close affinities with the early mammals.",

    "abstract": "A middle Miocene, early Barstovian land mammal age vertebrate assemblage, the Eastgate local fauna (LF), is known in the basal-most part of the Monarch Mill Formation.This rich assemblage of fossil vertebrates occurs within the Middlegate Basin in Churchill County, Nevada, USA.The Eastgate LF includes the fossil remains of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and over 25 families of mammals.Previous studies on the mammalian remains have revealed several endemic taxa of rodents and carnivores.Herein, we describe the ungulates, which include two taxa from two families of Artiodactyla (Ticholeptus sp., Merycoidodontidae and Barbouromeryx trigonocorneus, Palaeomerycidae) and three taxa from three families of Perissodactyla (Equidae gen.et sp.indet., Moropus merriami, Chalicotheriidae, and Teleoceras sp., Rhinocerotidae).Independent paleobotanical evidence nearly contemporaneous with the vertebrates indicates forest and shrubland paleovegetation, and suggests that the area had been uplifted to 2700-2800 m paleoaltitude.Therefore, this local fauna adds a rare glimpse of a medium-to high-altitude vertebrate community in the intermountain western interior of North America.Temporally-restricted taxa (especially the rodent Tardontia nevadans and chalicothere Moropus merriami) reinforce the early Barstovian age of the Eastgate LF and are consistent with tephrochronological dates and radiometric analyses.The presence of Barbouromeryx trigonocorneus at Eastgate is significant in that its occurrence potentially represents a temporal range extension into the early Barstovian (previously known from latest Arikareean to middle Hemingfordian), and extends the paleobiogeographic range from the Great Plains to the Great Basin.Unequivocally, the ungulates and other mammals of the Eastgate LF support the presence of a temperate forest ecosystem in the Great Basin just subsequent to the Miocene Climatic Optimum.",

    "abstract": "Lungfishes are one of the few early vertebrate clades with a rich 410-million-years-old fossil record.Lungfishes are characterized by a low evolutionary rate assumed to be associated with paedomorphosis since the Late Devonian.Lungfish paedomorphic trends include a reduction of the number of median fins, reduction of the number of cranial dermal bones, and reduction of the degree of neurocranial ossification.This neurocranial trait has evolved from heavily ossified in Devonian species to completely cartilaginous in post-Devonian species.Neurocranial conditions among derived Devonian lungfishes are needed to have a better understanding of paedomorphosis as a driving force during lungfish evolution.The neurocrania of two Devonian species, Scaumenacia curta (middle Frasnian, Escuminac Formation, eastern Canada) and Pentlandia macroptera (Givetian, Orcadian Basin, Scotland), have been micro-CT-scanned.These species were assumed to have a cartilaginous neurocranium like other \"phaneropleurids\" and \"fleurantids\".Juvenile (or sub-adult) and adult specimens of S. curta possess cartilaginous neurocrania, whereas P. macroptera is now recognized to have a poorly ossified neurocranium.Pyrite filled neurocranial cavities preserving some endocranial structures (e.g., olfactory bulbs, semicircular canals) allow us to code for phylogenetic endocranial characters in S. curta .This unique mode of preservation suggests that occasionally pyrite is a preservative rather than a destructive diagenetic agent.In the evolutionary gap between Pentlandia and Scaumenacia, paedomorphosis had already resulted in reduction of neurocranial ossification while little changes occurred in cranial dermal bones.",

Analysis of variation between Siderasirea species suggests that, like these nearshore populations, framework-building species have comparatively large corallite diameters; thin septa, columellae, and walls; and numerous synapticular rings. These results imply that skeletal configurations of Tertiary bank-building Siderastrea may have been uniquely adapted for rapid colony growth in turbid, protected environments with abundant suspended organic material.",

The evolutionary patterns observed in different facies demonstrate that: 1. most changes in diversity and speciation were strictly related to differences in the bioiogy of species adapted to different or changing environments, 2. the critical factors in encouraging diverSification of species appear to be a combination of ecologic conditions and paleogeographic situations, 3. some parallel evolutions were independent of environments and paieogeographic isolation but were due to time.",
