    "abstract": "Knowledge of jellyfish populations in the Mediterranean Sea is rather extensive, due to a combination of long-term datasets and interest relating to impacts on human activities. The notorious jellyfish Pelagia noctiluca appears to be blooming with increased frequency in some areas, and may sting tens of thousands of sea bathers in a single year. In addition, a number of invasive species of jellyfish appear to be thriving in the Mediterranean, some of which have significant impacts on fishing and other industries. In contrast, other groups of jellyfish show variable trends over time, and may be of little interest to the public. Here, we summarize knowledge of jellyfish in the Mediterranean Sea, including temporal trends for a variety of species, and discuss possible anthropogenic causes of increased jellyfish abundance and management interventions in the face of uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Structural changes in bottom communities in many coastal and offshore areas result from enhanced eutrophication and are characterized by the presence of species that are tolerant to a wide range of environmental disturbances. In soft bottom communities that are degraded or recovering from stress, Corbula gibba appears to be a highly abundant, ecologically important species and, therefore, an interesting subject for investigation. The literature compiled in this review reveals that, Corbula is a short-lived species with high fecundity, enormous production of small eggs, and a prolonged spawning season. The fertilization of spawned eggs in open waters is followed by pelagic development of larvae, accompanied by dispersal sometimes far from the mother population. High larvae settlement frequently appears as a recruitment boom in a new community after a catastrophe, making Corbula a short-term dominant species until the perished invertebrate species repopulate. As a dominant suspension feeder with rapid juvenile and adult growth, Corbula becomes an important element in the food chain as a transferor of organic matter from plankton to benthos. In a relatively stable soft-bottom community, the size of the Corbula population is mainly limited by the activity of competitors and predators. Dense Corbula populations may occur in a community with low species diversity in constantly and occasionally eutrophic areas. Generally, Corbula is considered an indicator of environmental instability caused by pollution, low oxygen content, or increased turbidity.",

This water mass is generated through substantial wintertime surface cooling and evaporation over the wide northern Adriatic and is known to (1) influence the Adriatic-Ionian thermohaline circulation, (2) bring oxygen and carbon to the deep Adriatic layers and, (3) more generally, have a substantial impact on the physics and biogeochemistry of the whole Adriatic. Second, the NAddW physics, from preconditioning, through generation and spreading, to accumulation in Adriatic depressions, is reviewed. Then, the temporal evolution of the NAddW properties influenced and connected to (1) basin-wide interannual and decadal variability and (2) trends towards warmer and saltier source characteristic due to ongoing climate change, is discussed. The importance of long-term observations and atmosphere-ocean modelling in event, decadal and climate studies is then presented. Finally, a review of the identified gaps and perspectives for future research is concluding this article.",

Here, we investigate Microcotyle from Pagrus pagrus off Tunisia (Western Mediterranean), combining morphological and molecular barcodes (28S rRNA and cox 1). The cox 1 sequence divergence between Microcotyle from P. pagrus off Tunisia and M. erythrini sensu stricto from P. erythrinus in the Mediterranean was 0-3 %, suggesting the presence of a single species. Newly generated cox 1 sequences clustered with high support within the M. erythrini sensu stricto clade reported from P. erythrinus in France and Spain and P. pagrus in Spain and Algeria. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial 28S rDNA sequences corroborated this, as the newly generated 28S sequences of M. erythrini from P. pagrus off Tunisia clustered alongside isolates from P. pagrus and P. erythrinus across the Western Mediterranean. We also provide novel morphometric and anatomical data for M. erythrini sensu lato based on Adriatic specimens (Montenegro) and discuss host specificity patterns in Microcotyle spp. from the Mediterranean. These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive taxonomic revisions and highlight the complexity of Microcotyle species associated with sparid hosts in the Mediterranean.",

The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 has led to the colonization of the Mediterranean Sea by a large number of tropical/subtropical species that have established viable populations along the The state of knowledge on marine alien molluscan species from the Gulf of Trieste and neighbouring areas is presented based on a critical review of records compiled from an extensive literature survey and from unpublished data obtained from 2006 to 2011, and enriched by older material preserved in private collections. Based on the IUCN definition of ‘alien’, 13 valid alien molluscan taxa (3 Gastropoda and 10 Bivalvia) are reported here, for each of which the following information (collected up to August 2011) is provided: published and unpublished records from the coastal and offshore territorial seawaters of the Gulf of Trieste and neighbouring areas, including lagoons; establishment status; vector(s) of introduction. The area was characterized by the presence of eight established alien species, while another four were considered as casual and one was, with caution, considered not established. Specimens of Anadara transversa (Say, 1822) and limnoperna securis (Lamarck, 1819) are first reported here from the Gulf of Trieste, thus reaching the extreme northern point of the Mediterranean Sea. Old distribution data on Mercenaria mercenaria (Linnaeus, 1758) and Mya arenaria Linnaeus, 1758 are considered unreliable, also according to the recent literature. Accurate analysis of bibliographic data as well as re-identification of specimens preserved in private collections or collected from the same published sampling sites led to the exclusion of Assiminea grayana Fleming, 1828 and Conomurex persicus (Swainson, 1821) from the resident fauna of the Gulf of Trieste. Concerning Arcuatula senhousia (Benson in Cantor, 1842), its first record from Slovenia came from bibliographic misreading, so that the original record of this bivalve from the area is considered more recent. Finally, natural dispersal accounts for 46% of the plausible vectors of introduction, while shipping/maritime transport and aquaculture for 23%.",

Model skills have been assessed by comparing CTR results in terms of gross statistical properties and storm features against wind data from coastal observatories along the whole Italian Adriatic coast, showing a satisfactory capability of capturing the main features of mean observed seasonal variability. Significant achievements with reference to existing climatological models have been observed especially in terms of wind directionality, with unprecedented performances in reproducing the bimodal dominance of Bora (from northeast) and Sirocco (from southeast) in the northern basin, and the typical patterns of Bora jets flowing from the mountain ridges enclosing the Adriatic Sea on its eastern side. Future projections generally confirm the tendency to a decreasing energy trend envisaged by previous studies, with a more marked effect for extreme events in the northern basin. Based on the comparison between climatological wind fields and the results of a SWAN wave model run forced by COSMO-CLM, we also define and test a criterion for a rapid identification of some relevant case studies for dedicated wave modelling experiments, without the need of running entire climatological wave simulations. This permits to focus the analysis of climatological oceanographic extreme events to a limited number of selected cases, allowing remarkable saving of computational effort especially if an ensemble approach is desired.",

To clarify this statement we set up in connection two inter-annual systems: the airsea interconnected system and pelagic ecosystems for the period 1961 to 2010. Within this period, significant changes occurred through 1987-1998 period, characterized by a drop of temperature, salinity and oxygen concentration in the middle Adriatic intermediate layer as consequence of a weaker ventilation of the Adriatic Sea. The pelagic ecosystem reacted to these changes. Large fluctuations in marine biota (from plankton to pelagic fish) revealed significantly different regimes before and after the late eighties. Different patterns observed through analyzed biotic parameters seem linked to modification in thermohaline circulation related to the Eastern Mediterranean Transient (EMT), whose effects prevented warmer and saltier water mass intrusions into the Adriatic Sea. These results provide evidence on connections between the shifts in the middle Adriatic pelagic ecosystem and the northern hemisphere climate via changes in regional atmospheric conditions, and highlight the importance of northern hemisphere climate changes for physical and biological regimes of the Adriatic Sea.",

This semienclosed and largely shallow basin has been subjected to intensive exploitation and destructive fishing practices for decades, resulting in biodiversity decline and poor ecosystem health. Diversity of cetaceans is lower than in other parts of the Mediterranean, and the extant dolphins and whales have been facing threats that include the combined effects of habitat loss and degradation, prey depletion, incidental mortality and injury caused by fisheries, anthropogenic noise, chemical contamination and climate change. Here, we report information for the nine cetacean species known to occur in the basin (classified as either regular, visitor or vagrant), plus three species characterized by a single record. For these species, we review evidence from field research and other studies – with a bias towards the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus (by far the most intensively-studied cetacean in this area). We also describe and characterize the main threats to cetaceans in the Adriatic, relying on recent literature as well as historical information that helps frame the present status of cetaceans in the context of past human impacts (particularly the extensive killing campaigns conducted until the 1960s). Finally, we provide management recommendations to inform and guide the action that must be taken in compliance with extant legislation, marine conservation directives and international commitments to protect marine biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "In Mali Ston Bay, located on the eastern Adriatic coast, mussels and oysters have traditionally been cultivated. However, previous studies showed that water and sediments from Mali Ston Bay contain elevated levels of some trace metals, which was attributed to natural processes of sedimentation and drainage. In order to assess the bioavailability of trace metals in the bay, and to assess the health risk of consumption of shellfish species from Mali Ston Bay, a passive monitoring program was carried out in the period from December 1998 to August 2005. Samples of the whole soft tissue were collected seasonally at 4 shellfish breeding farms and analyzed for essential (Cu, Zn) and non-essential (Cd, Cr, THg, Pb) metals. Mean concentrations of analyzed metals in the edible tissue of mussels (Cd: 1.15 mg kg-1 d.wt. ; Cr: 1.65 mg kg-1 d.wt. ; Cu: 5.6 mg kg-1 d.wt. ; THg: 0.15 mg kg-1 d.wt. ; Pb: 1.09 mg kg-1 d.wt. ; Zn: 139 mg kg-1 d.wt.) fell in the range of values usually found in low to moderately contaminated marine coastal areas. Examination of the spatial pattern of contaminants showed that there were no statistically significant differences among stations in Mali Ston Bay regarding trace metal content. Concentrations of Cd, Cu, Cr and THg were significantly higher during the autumn-winter period, while concentrations of Pb and Zn did not depend on the sampling season. Among six analyzed metals, only concentrations of Cd and THg were significantly negatively correlated with the condition index of the mussels. Analysis of temporal trends during the 7 years of monitoring showed that metal concentrations had not changed with time. According to EU and WHO legislation, consumption of the edible tissue of the mussels was not harmful for humans since all the values were well below the permissible limits for fresh seafood. In addition, results of the evaluation of the risks to human health associated with consumption of the mussels containing trace metals suggest that there is no health risk for moderate shellfish consumers.",

Samples were collected seasonally from May 2006 to January 2009 at 8 sampling sites in the bays and channels along the eastern Adriatic coast. Zooplankton population structure showed high similarity within the investigated region, especially evident in the homogeneity of copepod community composition, where relative importance of the individual species showed characteristic high ranking of small and medium-sized taxa. Zooplankton numerical variability primarily responded to seasonal variation in water temperature and spatial variation in salinity, but spatial distribution of the collected data showed that abundances were also linked to chemical and biological parameters generally used as descriptors of water quality. This indicates that zooplankton community size reflects the trophic status of an area and supports the use of zooplankton studies as an auxiliary method in the evaluation of the trophic state of coastal waters.",

    "abstract": "During the 2000-2009, a survey study on the spatiotemporal patterns of distribution of large predatory sharks was carried out in the Calabria region. A total of 12 species were recorded and among them the blue shark Prionace glauca and the bluntnose sixgill shark Hexanchus griseus were the most common ones. Also of interest was the frequency of species such as Carcharodon carcharias, Sphyrna zygaena and Cetorhinus maximus. 57% of all reported records derived from the Tyrrhenian side of the region and 43% on the Ionian side. A significant relationship between season of the year versus number of records was found, but this could be related to the small number of observers that were active during the winter months. The presence of Sphyrna lewini is reported for the study area; this species was previously recorded only in the western part of the Mediterranean Sea. This paper also provides evidence of the second and first documented accounts of white shark predation upon Tursiops truncatus and Stenella coeruleoalba, respectively, in the Mediterranean Sea. The recovering of Ionian Sphyrna zygaena populations and the declining of Lamna nasus populations were also noted.",

The seasonal changes define the application of different technological processes and are an aspect of quality of raw material, sensory attributes and storage stability. The results of monthly proximate composition analysis of the edible portion of anchovy were investigated over a period of two years. The average proximate composition of anchovy caught in the Adriatic Sea was as follows: water content 76.52 ± 1.38 %, protein content 21.34 ± 0.29 %, fat content 2.27 ± 1.20 %, ash content 1.42 ± 0.08 %. Protein and ash content showed small annual variations and differences within months were mostly insignificant. The fat and water content showed significant seasonal changes and a very strong negative correlation between fat and water content was observed (r = - 0.947). The fat content varied from 0.86 to 4.47 %, with a minimum in February and maximum in October. There was a statistically significant relationship between fat and water content at the 99% confidence level, indicating that this relation could be used to estimate fat content based on the analytical determination of water content.",

The species were classified according to the existing literature and experts’ judgment, as established, casual, invasive and expected. Finally, factsheets were compiled for ten species of high importance based on their expanding/invading character. Of the 160 species comprising the list, 149 were already present in the ESENIAS countries, while eleven were invasive species either present in the Mediterranean or in other European Seas, likely to be recorded in the ESENIAS countries. The majority of the species were of Red Sea/IndoPacific origin (97 species; 60.6%). Italy, Turkey and Greece were the countries with the highest representation of species (159, 152 and 139 species respectively), due to their extended coastline and the number of scholars working on marine invasive species. The highest number of established species was recorded in Turkey (116 species), whereas in Italy and Greece the most numerous species were the “expected” ones (85 and 48 species, respectively). The eastern Adriatic Sea countries (i.e. Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and Slovenia) had generally low numbers of species in this list, many of which are still “expected” to arrive from the neighbouring countries of Greece and Italy. Finally, the most frequently potential pathway was transfer stowaways (ship ballast water: 41 cases; ship hull fouling: 55), whereas unaided spread of Lessepsian immigrants followed (95 cases). This list is intended to serve as an early warning system that through horizon scanning process would assist ESENIAS countries to prioritise invasive alien species, their pathways and the areas of higher likelihood to appear, in order to take management measures.",

This study investigates the occurrence and potential impacts of C. sapidus in Italian inland waters, specifically examining specimens collected from an irrigation canal in Pomposa on the Adriatic coast and from the Ombrone River, flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea. Morphometric analysis revealed that males from Pomposa had a mean carapace width (CW) of 172.15 mm (±23.77 mm) and a mean weight of 282.10 g (±98.34 g), while females had a mean CW of 160.68 mm (±25.76 mm) and a mean weight of 173.26 g (±56.11 g). In contrast, males from the Ombrone River were significantly smaller, with a mean CW of 73.36 mm (±10.11 mm) and a mean weight of 25.33 g (±8.86 g). The sex ratio in Pomposa was heavily skewed towards males (3.26:1), suggesting a dominance of adult males in this freshwater habitat. A similar trend was observed in the Ombrone River, though based on a smaller sample size, with only 1 female among 10 specimens. The condition factor (K) was significantly higher for females (1.960) than for males (0.116), while growth coefficient (b) for males had a higher value (2.401) than that of females (1.788), indicating differing growth patterns. This study provides new ecological and biological data on C. sapidus in freshwater systems, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management to mitigate the spread and impact of this invasive species in Italian inland waters.",

Abundance, size-class and biomass distribution of the wild population living in the Pialassa Baiona lagoon were assessed and related to the hydrological and sediment characteristics. Despite the lagoon being affected by eutrophication, chemical and thermal pollution, the clams were harvested by about thirty professional fishermen until 2003. The commercially available stock was estimated at 36.8 10 3 kg in July 2002, 29.3 10 3 kg in April 2003, and 10.3 10 3 kg in October 2003. Stock estimations and observed mortality were in good accordance with the fishermen data. The decline of the available stock could be due to both overfishing and the extraordinary summer heat wave occurred in 2003, which may have reduced larval recruitment and increased the mortality. Overall, the juvenile recruitment appeared insufficient to annually restore the natural stock. Although the national and regional high relevance of clams market, local harvesting of wild populations appeared marginal and inadequate to support a remunerative commercial activity, due to the variability and unpredictability of the annual yield and the lack of a sustainable management based on a production chain’s approach.",

The seasonal distribution at the coastal areas mostly showed simultaneously the prevalence of LNA bacteria in the bacterial community and the high values of bacterial production, rescpetivelly during spring and summer. The prevalence of the HNA group in the bacterial community was found during colder seasons together with low values of bacterial production. Exceptions are identified in the areas influenced by rivers with the highest bacterial production, where HNA bacteria were dominant in the microbial community during all four seasons. On the open sea during the highest values of bacterial production looking seasonally, and vertically water column was dominated by LNA bacteria, indicating the importance of both groups of bacteria in the marine ecosystems of the waters studied.",

PAC concentrations were higher in the coastal area than in the open sea area. The highest PAC concentrations were measured in the vicinity of the industrial harbor of Split while the lowest concentrations were observed on stations located in the open sea area. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were dominant group of compounds on each investigated station with contributions in total PAC concentration of more than 85%. S-PAH concentrations were higher than O-PAH concentration in each sample and tend to decrease as the distance from the coast increased. Contributions of O-PAH in total PAC concentrations were higher in the open sea sediments while S-PAH contributions were higher in the coastal sediment, indicating a different origin of O-PAH. Grain size analysis of the investigated sediments shows the dominance of fine fraction in sediments in the coastal area whereas sandy particles were a dominant fraction in the open sea sediments. TOC concentrations were higher in the open sea area where lower PAH concentrations were observed, indicating a different origin of PAC and TOC. PAH origin was evaluated by application of diagnostic ratios. Pyrogenic origin was determined only on one station whereas dominance of petrogenic PAHs was observed on the most of the stations in the open sea area. Marine traffic was suspected to be the main source of pollution in the open sea area.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal fouling by diatoms was studied in the heavily polluted and eutrofied area near Piran in the Gulf of Trieste. Concrete plates (50 x 50 cm) were placed at l m, 3 m and 7 m depths, with the fouling observed monthly for one year, from March to October. Two plates were used at each level: one was scratched clean monthly to get an insight into the seasonality of fouling, while from the other only representative samples were taken in order to follow the fouling succession. In the eulittoral two quadrats of the same dimension were scratched clean on a vertical concrete wall. Diatoms proved to be the main fouling component sublittorally, while in the eulittoral green algae determined the physiognomy of the experi mental surfaces during spring. The present contribution deals only with the diatoms. Peaks of diatom colonization were found in April and August in the eulittoral, and sublittorally in July. Regarding the depth distribution, maxima in the number of recorded species were found at 3 m in spring, and at 7 m in autumn. The fouling populations were heterogenous, including epilithic, epipsammic and epipelic species with different affinities (marine, brackish and even freshwater). Colonial forms belonging to the genera Berkeleya, Navicula and Licmophora were outstanding and covered most of the experimental surfaces. Achnanthes species were among the primary colonizers, while Nitzschia species joined the fouling communities in autumn, along with several epipelic species. Seasonal recolonization on the monthly denuded plates was usual for species found sublittorally, either the whole year around, or only in autumn. Species found during spring did not recolonize monthly, and the same was true of the eulittoral ones.",

    "abstract": "The age and growth of bogue (Boops boops), collected in four areas off the Tunisian coast, were determined by studying growth marks on cross-sectioned otoliths. This calcified structure was chosen because the legibility and regularity of its growth mark patterns appeared to be more reliable than those of other skeletal elements. Opercula and fin rays were rejected because of intense bone remodeling, vertebrae because of numerous minute marks unrelated to cyclic events, and scales because counting of annuli seemed very unreliable, particularly in old specimens. Scales consistently had the highest average percent of error. Marginal zone analysis indicated that the hyaline zone in bogue otoliths was deposited yearly from November to April. Increase of length was determined and length-age data were fitted to Von BERTALANFFY equations. Comparisons of length increases of specimens from the four areas suggest two growth pools with greater increases in the north and east than in the Gulf of Tunis and the south. Relationships between growth and geographical distribution indicated the importance of environmental conditions especially water temperature and food availability, although the role of genetic and/or epigenetic factors could not be excluded.",

    "abstract": "The Adriatic Sea, as adjacent sea of the greater Mediterranean Sea, is under direct influence of atmospheric processes and their variability. Cold deep water formed under strong winter outbursts of Bura wind in the Northern Adriatic plays crucial role in the overall Adriatic circulation. Interannual variability of temperature and salinity in the Adriatic Sea is firstly interplay of Northern Adriatic Dense water (NAdDW) formation and intrusions of Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) (BULJAN, 1953; ZORE-ARMANDA, 1963; VILIBIC & ORLIC, 2001). The LIW continuously enters the Adriatic in the intermediate layer but with variable intensity depending on wider scale atmospheric conditions (ZORE-ARMANDA, 1972; GRBEC et al., 1998), which are of global character. It is supposed that El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was one of the mechanisms Applying sequential t-test analysis for regime shift detection on 52 years (period 1963-2004) of continuous summer thermohaline data at the three ocean stations in the Adriatic Sea, the two shifts in sea temperature were evidenced, around 1987 and 1998. These shifts separated three climate regimes, where the first climate regime is rather similar to the third one. The first climate regime (1963-1986) is characterized by moderate temperatures and rather high salinities. The first shift occurred in 1987, triggering the second climate regime, influenced by East Mediterranean Transient (EMT). The temperature and salinity in the Adriatic in the second climate regime were lower for one standard deviation than in the previous regime. In the third regime, after second shift the temperatures and salinities abruptly increased. All these conditions were influenced by changes in wind field pattern over the Mediterranean.",

Beside anthropogenic factors controlling jellyfish populations climate change may play an important role. The aim of this study was to assess whether climate-related factors in absence of other anthropogenically induced stressor influence medusae size. We investigated seasonal and interannual changes in the size of Aurelia in a jelly in the National Park of Mljet Island (Croatia) where minimal human impact on the environment makes the Veliko Jezero a natural mesocosm for understanding the impact of climate change on the Aurelia population. The observed changes suggest Aurelia medusa population response to changing environment, in particular to enhanced temperature, by reduced body sizes. Comparison of Aurelia population dynamics from different regions in the Mediterranean Sea revealed the unique feature of the Veliko Jezero population. Despite the similarity of the environmental windows of medusae occurrences in the Veliko Jezero and regions in the Mediterranean Sea, medusae in the Veliko Jezero are present all year round. It seems that the lake bathymetry enables medusae to vertically migrate to deeper and cooler water layer, avoiding the limiting temperatures developed in the upper layer during the summer. These conditions may prolong the Aurelia medusae life span and together with continuous strobilation support the stability of the Aurelia medusae population all year round.",

    "abstract": "The microbial abundances, including bacteria, viruses, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, were determined for two anchialine caves located on the Island of Mljet (Adriatic Sea): Bjejajka Cave and Lenga Pit. Both caves are situated approximately 100 m from the coast with extensive subterranean connections to the sea, resulting in noticeable marine and terrestrial, influences. Because of the shallow settings of the studied caves, they represent habitats with a minimal light or complete darkness where photosynthesis is minimal or not possible. Thus, during the surveys there was no evidence of cyanobacterial cells in either caves, but the presence of bacteria, viruses and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) was established. Further, bacterial abundance was higher in caves in comparison to surrounding open seawater. In the surrounding seawater the predominance of the LNA group over HNA is determined, which also indicates the differences in relation to the studied caves. In fact, the dominance of HNA group of bacteria in caves together with higher total bacterial abundance indicates that the caves are of higher trophic level than the surrounding seawater. With regard to bacterial diversity, both caves had a unique makeup of bacterial populations and low diversity, with the chemolithoautotrophic Epsilonproteobacteria representing the most abundant taxonomic group. To examine the mechanisms regulating bacterial abundance in these habitats, we observed the relationship between bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and between bacteria and viruses. The importance of predation in controlling bacteria (top down control) and, consequently, the domination of bottom up control of HNF were observed in both caves",

The growth rate and condition index were monitored during a 13-month study at three different sites: 1) close to fish cages (NBL), 2) 100 m removed from fish cages (NUD), 3) at a monoculture mussel farm (SVN) around 8 km far away from cages. The most intense growth of mussels was recorded in spring, and the least intense in summer. After 13 months, monitored individuals at all three locations achieved commercial size. The growth rate was very similar at all sites. The condition index showed spatial and temporal differences. Condition index values on site NUD were mostly higher compared to SVN and NBL, which were very similar, exept for the period from October to December when CI was similar on NBL and NUD site and higher in comparation with SVN. CI values on NBL an NUD site during cold period indicate on fact that mussels probably feed on the nutrients from fish farm origins.The highest mortality rate was recorded at the NBL site, probably due to the effects of fouling organisms.",

The aim was to analyse the qualitative distribution and identify the main components of this gelatinous fauna in different coastal ecosystems in western, central and eastern regions. A total of 60 taxa of planktonic cnidarians were identified, including 57 hydrozoans and three scyphozoans. The class Hydrozoa were represented by 34 hydromedusae, primarily belonging to orders Anthoathecata (15 taxa) and Siphonophorae (23 taxa). Several reported hydrozoan species were recorded for the first time in the southwestern Mediterranean Sea. These new regional records include the hydromedusae Kantiella enigmatica, Leuckartiara octona, Proboscidactylaornata, Cunina globosa, Lovenella cirrata, Cirrholovenia tetranema, Phialella quadrata, Homoeonema platygonon and the siphonophore Forskalia contorta . Seasonal fluctuations were observed in biodiversity, with the highest species richness in spring and summer. The most common species are the calycophorous siphonophores Abylopsis tetragona, Muggiaea atlantica, Lensia subtilis Muggiaea kochii and the holoplanktonic medusae Aglaura hemistoma, Rhopalonema velatum, Solmundella bitentaculata, Liriope tetraphylla and Pelagia noctiluca .

    "abstract": "Oceanographic conditions in the Adriatic Sea strongly depend on inflows of highly saline and warmer LIW from the eastern Mediterranean as well as on the formation of cold, dense water in the North Adriatic. Both phenomena have different intensity from one year to another. Pressure field distribution, over the area larger than the Adriatic regulates both mechanisms. Stronger inflows were observed when high pressure over the North Atlantic and lower pressure over the East Mediterranean occurred, i.e. when horizontal pressure differences between these areas were higher. As the intensity of inflow varies from one year to another, a water mass distribution follows year-to-year fluctuations. To find out what meteorological processes determined main Adriatic inflows, intermediate Middle Adriatic salinity fluctuations were discussed in relation to the NAO, and pressure fields over the Europe. From the long-term pressure field data, main variability patterns were extracted, using the Principal Component Analysis. The analysis reveals the presence of the strong inter-annual correspondence between the time evolutions of the modes responsible for the pressure field over the Mediterranean and Atlantic, and the Adriatic salinity. Further analysis enabled locating the areas whose pressure is directly related to the inflow phenomena, which generally causes higher salinity in the Adriatic. These analyses led to the definition of the Mediterranean Oscillation index (MOI).",

Seven species: Atherina boyeri (33.3%), Pomatoschistus marmoratus (23.2%), Liza aurata (8.3%), Liza ramada (7.1%), Aphanius fasciatus (5.5%), Pomatoschistus bathi (5.1%) and Diplodus annularis (2.9%) comprised 85.4% of the total. The nMDS plots of fish assemblages at 6 sampling stations show some seasonal differences, especially between summer and winter samples. With respect to similarities between sampling station, stations 1, 5 and 6, and also stations 2 and 3 appear to be similar. Fish assemblage at station 4 appears to be different than fish assemblages at other stations. Results of ANOSIM2 test for the un-replicated 2-way layout showed that there was significant difference in species assemblages at different sites (Rho=0.385, P=0.007), while statistically significant difference was not noted between seasons (Rho=0.221, P=0.057). Changes in spatial and temporal distribution of fishes were related to their ecological categories. Results of this study demonstarate that Pantan lagoon is important fish nursery habitat that, although rather small, has high spatial fish diversity and therefore deserves special protection.",

In 1998, 31 stations during March and 30 stations during July were sampled on the continent shelf between Cape Blanc (21° O'N) and Cape Boujdor (26°30'N). Holoplankton dominated the zooplankton assemblages. Copepods represented 86% of the zooplankton in March and 73% in July. Herbivorous species were the main components of the 78 identified copepod species (60 species in March and 49 in July). Four species were recorded for the first time in this area: Calanus hyperboreus, Scaphocalanus brevicornis, S. medius, and Heterocope saliens. Both zooplankton abundance and diversity were related to changes in ecological parameters resulting from upwelling currents. The uplift of cold water enriched superficial water layers with nutrients and induced strong primary production upon which zooplankton depend. This study discusses the environmental features that influence plankton resources and the relationship of plankton production to the pelagic fisheries off northwest Africa.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of aquaculture in the Mediterranean, a number of parasitic diseases have emerged in cage-reared fish. In confined rearing conditions, the diseases can induce mortality and economic losses related to suppressed growth. With diversification of aquaculture products and the introduction of new fish species into the rearing system, new parasitic pathogens have found their way into new environments, resulting in adaptation of the parasite, new colonization on resident aquaculture species (primarily sea bass and sea bream), or increased parasite prevalence and abundance on the newly cultivated fish species. The parasitofauna of reared fish is impoverished in terms of species richness and has greater population values than in the wild fish population. While the parasitofauna of fish reared in the Mediterranean is discussed in numerous publications, only occasional findings specifically refer to the Adriatic Sea. Wild fish populations in the Adriatic Sea have been sampled for parasite isolation and identification but an overview of reared fish parasitofauna has never been reported.

During the last two decades the Lake has been exposed to multiple changes mainly due to local human activities. Monthly zooplankton samples were collected during an integrated environmental monitoring program within the MELMARINA Project that extended from July 2003 to September 2004 to study the distribution and occurrence of zooplankton community in Lake Manzalah. Results showed that, the average zooplankton standing crop was 1277 x 10 3 individuals m -3 . Spring was the most productive season (2127 x 10 3 individuals m -3 ) representing 41.65% to the total zooplankton counts. Five groups dominated zooplankton community; Rotifera, Copepoda, Ostracoda, Protozoa and Cladocera. The meroplanktonic larvae of Polychaeta, Cirripedia, Mysidacea and Gastropoda as well as free living nematods were rarely recorded. Rotifera contributed 81.89% to the total zooplankton community. They were represented by 38 species belonging to 19 genera dominated by genus Brachionus (86.65% of the total Rotifera) followed by genus Keratella (8.68%). Keratella species has been indicated as an indicator of pollution. Copepoda (including their larval stages) was the second group in order of abundance forming about 14.28% of the total zooplankton counts and represented by seven species. Acanthocyclops americanus was the dominant species. The productivity of Lake Manzalah decreased from 1979 to become highly eutrophic lake during the present study, but with higher production than the other Egyptian lakes. Management is needed to stabilize the Manzalah lake ecosystem in a way that promotes the sustainability of the system.",

The highest relative species abundance in all water bodies was close to 15%. The dominant species confirmed that the environment of the Gulf of Trieste is unstable. This environmental instability could also explain the rather high values of AMBI. The MDS analysis and other applied indices indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between water bodies. The values for Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) and Pielou's index (J) were among the highest ever recorded for the soft-bottom assemblages of the Gulf of Trieste. The analysis of benthic biocoenoses revealed that the sampling area is a boundary between infra- and circalittoral belts, which could explain the very high species richness.",

    "abstract": "Seawater salinity changes and thermal stress have been considered to be among the most important determinants of rocky intertidal zone organism distribution. The aim of present study was to determine the freshwater influx and evaluate the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis shells as indicators of natural environmental conditions by comparing δ 13 C of shell carbonate layers with seawater salinity and temperature values measured over the 1998-2007 period. Our results show that the salinity was relatively constant in the open sea, with typical values of the northern and southern Adriatic being 37.65 ± 0.40 and 38.37 ± 0.19 respectively. It varied in intertidal zones, estuaries, locations close to under-sea freshwater springs and during rainy days in closed lagoons on different locations along eastern Adriatic coast. Salinity and temperature variations at investigated sites showed freshwater influx which was also reflected in lower δ 13 C values of mussel M. galloprovincialis shell carbonates. Based on the measured parameters, three groups of locations in the investigated area (25 locations) can be defined: locations with strong to medium freshwater influence (9), with minor freshwater influence (6) and marine environment locations (10). Our results confirm that mussel M. galloprovincialis responds sensitively to subtle changes in the environmental conditions. Results of the isotopic analyses presented in this study support the hypothesis that the δ 13 C in mussel's shell might be used as an indicator of environmental salinity conditions and hypo-osmotic stress. Therefore such investigations might represent an additional tool for waste water management and environmental protection.",

The status of the species is still poorly known and there is a knowledge gap about its distribution, abundance and biological parameters. The significant ecological role of C. glaucum in the ecosystem and its possible future commercial interest requires a better knowledge of its stock. This study aimed to investigate the distribution, abundance and biology of these cockles along the Gabes coast. Cockles were collected, treated and data were analysed. In terms of geographical occupation, maps of the population distribution were drawn. The results showed a scattered distribution pattern of the species according to location ranging between 0 and 270 individuals per square meter. The consequence was a remarkable biomass which represented 1290±326 tons of total fresh weight and high abundance levels reaching over 403±104 million individuals estimated in the area of 3723 hectares. The distribution of the species has also been investigated in consideration with the size which varied markedly according to location, while the shell length ranged between 5 and 37 mm. Samples presented a balanced sex ratio, with males dominating among smaller individuals and females predominating in larger size-classes contrary to previous findings on this species. The size at which 50% of the population reached maturity was 14.29 and 16.59 mm SL for males and females, respectively. Findings of the current study suggest that C. glaucum well proliferates in southern Tunisian waters.",

In total, 12 species of hydromedusae and six species of siphonophores were found. With the exception of the instant blooms of Obelia spp. (341 ind. m-3 in December), hydromedusae were generally less frequent and abundant: their average and median values rarely exceed 1 ind. m-3. On the contrary, siphonophores were both frequent and abundant. The most numerous were Muggiaea kochi, Muggiaea atlantica, and Sphaeronectes gracilis. Their total number was highest during the spring-summer period with a maximum of 38 ind. m-3 observed in May 2009 and April 2010. M. atlantica dominated in the more eutrophicated inner area, while M. kochi was more numerous in the outer area, highly influenced by open sea waters. This study confirms a shift of dominant species within the coastal calycophores in the Adriatic Sea observed from 1996: autochthonous M. kochi is progressively being replaced by allochthonous M. atlantica in the coastal waters, especially in the eutrophicated areas. This study provides a detailed report on the composition and abundance of the planktonic cnidarians community in this region, and should be considered as a baseline for future studies on gelatinous zooplankton.",

In the present study,we investigated the effect of aquaculture site and translocation on different stocks of Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819. We used shell morphological ratios (width/length, height/length and height/width) and allometric relationships (volume-length and shell weight-length) in addition to condition index (wet meat weight/total weight) and mortality to compare cultivated and translocated mussels from the northern Adriatic Sea, Croatia. Mussels were collected from five cultivation areas (Lim, Pomer, Raša, Vabriga and Budava), and then moved for three months to experimental station at marine protected area in Lim Bay. Differences between cultivated mussels suggested morphological plasticity, although translocation weakly affected allometric relationships. Decrease in condition index was pronounced in translocated mussels, indicating adaptation to different local environmental conditions. High post translocation mortality was observed in mussels transferred to the experimental area. Our study shows plastic response of M. galloprovincialis, which can provide a useful information of mussel stocks selection in aquaculture.",

    "abstract": "Some early results of the TerraSAR - X observations of the northeastern Adriatic bora wind are presented in this paper. TerraSAR - X is a German X - band radar satellite launched in 2007 that carries phased array X - band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operating in different polarizations and providing multiple imaging modes. SAR backscatter can be used to derive wind fields at spatial re solution that no other instrument can provide. Terrain - induced jet and wake patterns are particularly conductive to the SAR - instrument examination. Bora, a cold and dry downslope wind blowing from north - easterly directions on the e astern side of the Adriatic Sea, exhibits such a response. Since bora is primarily winter wind and the town of Senj is known for frequent and severe bora episodes we focus on TerraSAR - X scenes collected in the winter s of 2011 and 2012 over an area with Senj roughly in its center. Recently developed XMOD2 geophysical model function is used for wind magnitude derivation, whereas the WRF model was employed to estimate the wind direction. The selected TerraSAR - X scenes have captured representative bora events exhibiting rich details in bora - induced jet and wake patterns on the lee of the Dinaric Alps. T h e details registered in the normalized radar cross section response strongly suggest the need for still higher resolution numerical simulations in order to properly model the orographic impact on and the fine details in the surface wind field. Comparisons with both research and operational modeling results indicate that the currently used geophysical model function may benefit from enlarging the matchup data base with samples of severe winds.",

The digestive systems of five specimens of the black scorpionfish, Scorpaena porcus L., from the eastern Adriatic Sea, were analysed histologically. The paraffin sections of oesophagus, stomach, intestine, liver, gallbladder and pancreas have been stained by hematoxylin – eosin technique in order to distinguish the main histological features of the digestive system in black scorpionfish. The wall of oesophagus and stomach is formed by four distinctive layers: the mucosa, the submucosa, the muscular and the outer layer. The wall of intestine and gallbladder consisted of three distinctive layers: the mucosa, the muscular and the outer layer. The mucosa is the innermost layer, which consists of two different layers: the epithelium and lamina propria. The submucosa is a layer of connective tissue with blood vessels and nerve fibres, and it has not been seen in the intestine and gallblader. In the oesophagus, stomach and intestine, the muscular layer consists of two layers of muscle fibres: circular and longitudinal. In the oesophagus the inner muscular layer consisted of longitudinally arranged striated, while the outer layer consisted of circular muscle fibres. The arrangement of muscular layers in the stomach and intestine is reverse. The muscular layer in the gallbladder is made of a single layer of smooth muscular tissue. The outermost layer of the upper parts of visceral organs is adventitia consisting of connective tissue. In the caudal parts of digestive tract, this layer is replaced by serosa. The liver consists of hepatocytes that are surrounded by mass of fat – storing cells. The arrays of hepatocytes are separated by system of sinusoidal capillaries. The pancreas consists of serous acini.",

    "abstract": "Rogoznica Lake (RL) – Dragon Eye is a unique, eutrophic marine lake on the eastern Adriatic coast. The lake exhibits seasonal variations between stratified and anoxic holomictic conditions. Under stratified conditions, RL shows typical euxinic features characterized by an euxinic hypolimnion (&amp;lt; 8 meters deep in recent years) with a relatively high total concentration of reduced sulfur species (RSStot). These species are mainly present in the form of sulfides, non-volatile RSS (RSSnv) attributed to elemental sulfur (S0), and polysulfides (Sx2-). The concentration of RSStot, particularly the RSSnv and Sx2-, varies seasonally depending on the physicochemical conditions in the water column, i.e. the position and stability of the chemocline and the entire water column, expressed by the Schmidt Stability Index (SSI), as well as the light intensity reaching this layer. In the summer months, when stratification is the strongest, the concentrations of the RSSnv in and below the chemocline are generally higher. In addition, the highest concentrations of Sx2- (up to 90 µM of polysulfidic S0) are detected during this period. This increase is related to a more intense microbial activity of phototrophic purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), which then reach maximum abundance due to the increased temperature and maximum light intensity. Typically, the highest concentrations of Sx2- are found below the chemocline. Long-term data indicate that the concentration of RSSnv at the chemocline and 1 m below it depends on the hydrostatic stability of the water column and shows periodic changes. This contrasts with the previously recorded trend of increasing RSStot in the anoxic monimolimnion.",

Subsequent studies have reported its presence in the Levantine basin along the coasts of Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and Cyprus, with uncertainties around its taxonomic assignment. This paper highlights the presence of two alien Elysia species included in these reports, separated now for the first time. We also present new findings of Elysia sp. 2’s range, marking its first occurrence in the Aegean Sea in July 2024 along the coast of Lipsi Island, Greece. This record represents the species’ westernmost distribution in the Mediterranean basin, highlighting a potential ongoing range expansion. Although further examinations in the region would be needed to fully ascertain whether an established population is present in the Aegean Sea, this report demonstrates the importance of continuous monitoring in the early detection of the presence of alien and invasive species, to inform conservation and management strategies.",

Each month from June 2023 till September 2024 all biological samples were collected along the eastern Adriatic by commercial purse seiner “srdelara”. A total of 742 stomach samples were analysed. Small pelagic species such as sardine ( Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792)), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus (Linnaeus, 1758)) and round sardinella ( Sardinella aurita Valenciennes, 1847) primarily consumed copepods, while medium pelagic species including Atlantic horse mackerel ( Trachurus trachurus (Linnaeus, 1758)), Mediterranean horse mackerel ( Trachurus mediterraneus (Steindachner, 1868)), Atlantic chub mackerel ( Scomber colias Gmelin, 1789), and bogue ( Boops boops (Linnaeus, 1758)) favoured larger prey such as mysids, euphausids, and decapod larvae. Seasonal variations were observed, with copepods dominating diets during warmer months and larger prey items during the colder part of the year. Lower differences between small and medium species diets occurred in warmer months, linked to increased zooplankton availability in the investigated area. The results obtained in this study indicated potential competition among the observed pelagic species, particularly under resource-limited conditions, highlighting the necessity of adopting an ecosystem-based approach in fisheries management. Such an approach would undoubtedly ensure the sustainable exploitation of these renewable resources in the Adriatic Sea.",

This paper reports the first confirmed occurrence of B. nectabanus in Montenegrin waters. The specimen was caught by beach seine in the interior of Boka Kotorska Bay at a depth of less than 20 m. Morphometric measurements were compared with existing Adriatic and Mediterranean records, revealing general consistency, although minor deviations were attributed to intraspecific variability, ontogeny, or ethanol-induced shrinkage. An updated overview of Mediterranean records from 2002 to 2024 is provided. While the overall distribution pattern supports a Lessepsian migration pathway, the occurrence of the species in areas of intensive maritime traffic suggests that secondary dispersal via ballast water may contribute to its spread. These findings extend the known range of B. nectabanus in the Adriatic Sea, indicating an ability to exploit shallow coastal environments. Further monitoring and genetic studies are recommended to clarify the mechanisms underlying its ongoing expansion.",

    "abstract": "Marine environments worldwide are affected by various anthropogenic activities, and many cetacean populations face increasing human pressures, especially those in coastal habitats. The key threats affecting common bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ) today are fishery interactions, prey depletion, habitat disturbance, pollution and climate change. The Mediterranean basin is one of the areas subjected to enormous pressure from human activities, in particular the Adriatic Sea, where bycatch represents the most frequent cause of dolphin mortality related to fisheries, followed by larynx strangulations, long-term tail entanglement and presence of fishing gear residue in the stomach. In this study, we present the first published case of a resident bottlenose dolphin from the Adriatic Sea population with a known observation history and confirmed cause of death observed in the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea. By comparing the photographs of the dolphin’s dorsal fin taken during the post mortem examination with those obtained from boat-based surveys, we were able to identify the individual L_1834, which has been observed since 2018 along the eastern coast of the northern Adriatic Sea. Over three decades of monitoring live bottlenose dolphins and their systematic mortality surveillance in Croatian waters enabled us to gain insight into the ranging and residency pattern of the dolphin stranded in 2023 due to larynx strangulation with fishing net parts.",

For most part of the year at open sea and channel stations EH values were mainly positive (+150 to 0 mV), even to 10 cm sediment depth. Positive EH (absence of sulphate reduction with very low sulphide concentrations) at these stations is probably caused by low to medium organic matter sedimentation rates. Negative EH values (presence of sulphide and appearance of anoxic conditions in sediment) and shallow redox transition depths in sediment were found in areas with higher productivity and organic matter sedimentation such as eutrophicated Kastela Bay after a winter plankton bloom, a near shore station exposed to a city wastewater outlet and stations located under fish farm cages. Vertical profiles of sediment EH, ironbound phosphorus fraction and Fe(III)OOH investigated at a middle Adriatic tuna farm indicated a relationship between redox potential and phosphate adsorption/desorption processes.",

Basic characteristics of SSFs in each country are presented. Specific conclusions related to improvement of coastal resources state in term of sustainable use are suggested together with proposal for additional conservation measures and actively involving fishermen in the management process.

It includes 13 species, namely Sepia dollfusi, Stoloteuthis leucoptera, Sepioteuthis lessoniana, Architeuthis dux, Cranchia scabra, Taonius pavo, Megalocranchia sp., Teuthowenia megalops, Cycloteuthis sirventi, Taningia danae, Octopus cyanea, Amphioctopus sp. and Tremoctopus gracilis. The presence of Sepia pharaonis needs to be confirmed, whereas that of Sepia gibba and Spirula spirula is excluded. The arrivals from the Atlantic Ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar are related to the entrance surface current, which either carried passively planktonic paralarvae or favoured in some other way the entrance of subadult and adult stray specimens. As a matter of fact, all Atlantic cephalopods are pelagic oegopsid squids, with the exception of the nekto-benthic sepiolid S. leucoptera; all of them have been found only in the western Mediterranean basin. None of them seemingly established a stable population there, apart from the latter species. On the contrary, the cephalopods entering the Mediterranean from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal (Lessepsian migrants) lead a benthic mode of life. At least two of them, namely S. lessoniana and Amphioctopus sp., set up stable populations in the eastern basin. Lastly the occurrences of the pelagic octopod T. gracilis are ascribed, in the literature, to human-mediated transfer.",

Given the evident decline of the nursehound population in the Mediterranean and its high vulnerability, investigating spawning and potential nursery areas is crucial for the conservation of this species. Using non-invasive techniques such as diving activities with the help of R.O.V. ( Remote Operated Vehicle ), spawning areas have been identified along the Tuscany coast in Italy. In addition, B.R.U.V.S. ( Baited Remote Underwater Video System ) was used as an auxiliary method to diving activities in order to record the presence of nursehound individuals. Between 2018 and 2024 (except for 2022), 66 eggs were spotted around Monte Argentario peninsula on the Argentarola Island, Grotta del Corallo, Cala Grande, Capo D’Uomo, Cala della Maddalena and around Giannutri Island in Punta Scaletta. The highest number of eggs was observed around the Argentarola Island, Grotta del Corallo, and Cala Grande, both daily and during the entire study period, which suggests that these three sites represent spawning areas. Furthermore, two adult nursehound individuals have also been sighted near Argentarola Island, suggesting this site could represent a potential nursery area. Further data will be collected in these sites through more in-depth investigation in order to understand spatial distribution patterns, relative abundance, population estimates and behavior of this species along the Tuscany coast.",

These records are based on 122 confirmed sightings of the species recorded between June 2024 and January 2025, providing evidence of a rapid and extensive expansion of the species in the eastern Adriatic waters. Most records originated from citizen science via direct reports of sightings, complemented by monitoring of social networks and online media platforms. The highest number of sightings was recorded around the islands of Lastovo and Vis, while the area around Dubrovnik had the highest number of sightings along the mainland coast. The majority of individuals (72.7%) were sighted within the first 15 meters of depth, with most individuals estimated to be 15 cm or smaller in length. No correlations between depths and lengths of individuals, as well as between time and latitude of sighting were detected. Most sightings occurred during diving activities, with a few involving captured specimens. The observed expansion is likely a result of larval transport via sea currents and subsequent settlement, as the pattern of records aligns with general circulation patterns along the eastern Adriatic coast. Given the species’ biological traits, which facilitate rapid and extensive establishment in invaded areas, this expansion poses certain ecological risks, particularly in key coastal habitats that host ecologically and economically important fish species. We encourage targeted removal strategies, particularly in ecologically significant areas such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), commercialization of the species and reduction of fishing pressure on natural predators as mitigation measures.",

Surveys were performed during a six-year period (2019-2024) from 24 hauls. Sampling was carried out using a bottom trawl during regular fishing activities (Fishing for Litter - FFL). Seafloor marine litter was classified into nine main categories (plastic, metal, rubber, cardboard/paper, textile/natural fibres, glass/ceramics, processed wood, and two categories of unclassified waste) in the laboratory of the Institute of Marine Biology, Kotor. The total average density of collected litter was 260.89 items/km2. The highest concentration of marine litter was determined in the Boka Kotorska Bay area, near the shoreline, at a depth range of 35-40 metres with an average density of 597.39 items/km2. The lowest value was recorded in the open part of the Montenegrin coast at depths of between 60 and 120 metres (148.74 items/km2). The highest concentration of marine litter near the coast is a consequence of increasingly intensive urbanisation, river inflows and the hydrological characteristics of the area. Plastic represents the dominant category in terms of the number of items, followed by metal and textiles/natural fibres. Marine litter related to fishing activities accounted for 3.34 % of the total litter collected on the seafloor.",

In this study, through online questionnaires administered to recreational fishers, we collected information on recreational fishing activities and their interaction with the most common demersal elasmobranchs along the western coast of the Northern Adriatic Sea. The responses revealed an intense fishing effort throughout the coastal area, especially around port entrances. The target species resulted primarily in those with high commercial value, while elasmobranchs are mostly bycatch, particularly Mustelus spp. Although 83% of fishers claimed to release them alive, the lack of studies on post-release survival rates makes it difficult to assess the impact of this fishing activity on elasmobranch populations.",

Twenty-two protein loci were analyzed and polymorphism was found in six of them. Based on genetic-biochemical data, we hypothesize that there are two anchovy subspecies, European and African. The former inhabits the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean coast of Europe, and the Aegean, Marmora, Black, and Azov Seas. The latter is found in the Cape Blank region of the Atlantic Ocean and, probably, along the northwestern part of the African coast. The Aegean anchovy consists of hybrid populations, resulting from introgressive hybridization between the European and the African populations. No evidence for subspecies differentiation between the populations from the European coast of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean was found. Genetic distances between the Azov and Black Sea populations show that the former probably entered the Black Sea during the Karangad period and the latter during the last connection of the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. The genetic distance between the Black Sea anchovy and the Azov anchovy shows that they could be specified as two different populations. Probably some earlier subspecies differences disappeared as a result of introgressive hybridization.",

During the winter, 4% of the specimens had tiny perforations on the outer and inner faces of the valves, the perforations were connected to an intra-valve network of galleries, caused by 10-12 mm Sipunculoidea. Of specimens collected in February-March, 4% were infested with the lithophagous bivalve, Gastrochaena dubia, that lived within a cavity in the V. verrucosa valves. The cavity communicated to the outside through a calcareous tube developed by the G. dubia near the exit of the V. verrucosa siphons, indicating parasitism that can cause progressive perforation of the valve and lead to the death of the host.",

Marine and estuarine species represented 89.6 and 10.4 %, respectively, while freshwater species were not observed in samples. Differences in fish assemblages were observed with respect to sampling dates and station mostly due different temporal and spatial distribution of juvenile fish settlers. Juveniles of open sea spawners (L. mormyrus, P. erythrinus) were found with increased distance from the river mouth. As they progressively grow, they disperse throughout the estuary. Juveniles of resident species (Pomatoshistus sp.) stayed closer to the river mouth. Permanent estuary residents comprised 11 species, 33 species were opportunists and the remaining 3 were transients. The data thus show that in even small temperate estuaries characteristics of river inflow have the potential to alter spatio-temporal patterns in infralittoral fish assemblage.",

Artificial structures consisted of limestone boulders of a breakwater (Marina Rovinj, northern Adriatic Sea, Croatia) constructed 19 years before sampling of the date mussel. Date mussels'density (around 80 individuals per 0.1 m 2 ) did not differ between the two types of structure. However, the length frequency distribution in artificial structures (25 th percentile = 3.20, median = 4.30 and 75 th percentile = 5.10 cm) differed from that in natural structures (25 th percentile = 3.66, median = 5.15 and 75 th percentile = 6.20 cm) leading to a substantial difference in total biomass (0.3 and 0.8 kg per 0.1 m 2 for artificial and natural structures, respectively). Parameter estimates of regression functions for width against length (linear function) and for live weight against length (allometric function) also significantly differed, indicating variations in date mussels' morphometry between the two types of structure. Analyses of variance did not detect differences in width or weight for date mussels in the length range from 3 to 3.5 cm. However, width (average ± s.d., n = 18) of individuals in the range from 5.5 to 6 cm was significantly lower in artificial structures (1.46 ± 0.13 cm) than in natural structures (1.66 ± 0.10 cm). Consistent with this, live weight in artificial structures (8.36 ± 1.17 g) was significantly lower than that in natural structures (12.33 ± 1.48 g). It is suggested that these patterns reflect a growth rate of the date mussel that is higher in artificial than in natural structures. Information about date mussels' biometric patterns in different habitats is important in planning studies assessing the resilience capability of natural populations after illegal destructive harvesting, particularly as,such studies are lacking.",

For the description of the structure of each nest, algal species, benthic invertebrates and type of substrata within the nest were determined, as well as the features of each microhabitat. A Redundancy Analysis (RDA) was performed in order to highlight the distribution of the three species in relation to environmental variables and their preferences for different biotic and abiotic variables in the construction of nests. Labrid species were found to be more abundant on rocky bottoms, where the Cystoseiretum barbatae association is dominant. It seems that the studied species show a preference for some microhabitats, although are building their nests using the most abundant algal material in the environment. Only S. ocellatus seems to select shrub-forming algae as the main nest-forming material.",

Several interesting processes were captured within the series of which we investigated the wintertime cooling that occurred in 2006, diurnal and semidiurnal temperature changes driven by the tides within the connecting channel and the occurrence of turbulence in BL close to the connecting channel. The latter seems to have large implications for the thermocline/pycnocline deepening during the summertime, as incoming open ocean waters are much denser than the BL waters.",

Since then, the toxin profile of Adriatic shellfish has become complex and the number of recorded toxic and potentially toxic species has increased over the time. Up to date, phycotoxins determined in Adriatic shellfish or phytoplankton belong to various groups od toxins: okadaic acid toxin group, saxitoxin group, domoic acid group, yessotoxins (YTXs), pectenotoxins (PTXs), gymnodimines (GYMs), spirolides (SPX) and palytoxins (PLTs). Toxins from okadaic acid group and YTXs are highlighted as the main phycotoxins in shellfish along Croatia coast of the Adriatic Sea. Toxins from okadaic acid group has been determined in high concentration that could endanger human health while YTXs have been determined more often in shellfish samples, comparing to other phycotoxins. Regarding toxic phytoplankton species reported in the Adriatic Sea, only for ten species toxin production has been confirmed and 20 species are suspected to be toxic. Toxicity has been confirmed for eight dinoflagellates species: Alexandrium minutum, Alexandrium ostenfeldii, Dinophysis fortii, Gonyaulax spinifera, Lingulodinium polyedrum, Ostreopsis cf. ovata, Prorocentrum lima, Protoceratium reticulatum and two diatom species Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries. Toxin profile has yet to be defined for other potentially toxic phytoplankton species found along Croatian coast of the Adriatic Sea. Most of those species are Dinophysis and Pseudo-nitzschia species, which are relatively common and abundant in this area as well as toxins from okadaic acid group in shellfish.",

The taxonomy of Trichodinids is based on the structure and the appearance of the adhesive disc and number and size of its constituents. All of these features can be revealed only by the silver impregnation technique of Klein (KLEIN, 1958). Consequently, the numerous species identified early without silver techniques are inadequately described (LOM & DYKOVA, 1992). Today, ten genera are described within the family Trichodinidae. The genus Trichodina Ehrenberg, 1838 is the largest of this family; more than 200 species have been described from fish (ASMAT et al., 2005). Trichodinids have During a parasitological survey in Ghar El Melh Lagoon in Tunisia, 108 flathead mullet (Mugil cephalus L., 1758) were investigated for protozoan ectoparasites.

The overall infestation prevalence and mean intensity level were 22.42 % and 70 ± 8.1 trichodinids per fish, respectively. The highest prevalence was observed in spring. The relationship between host’s size and parasite prevalence was significant.

Of 20 calycophoran species collected, most of them inhabited layers of specific temperature and light intensity, and migrated during night. The deep species Kephyes ovata is primarily non-migratory. Typical nocturnal movements to the surface were recorded for Lensia conoidea and Sphaeronectes koellikeri. Lensia subtilis and Eudoxoides spiralis migrated toward surface in the evening but sank deeper at night. Lensia meteori and Lensia fowleri reached upper layers at midday. The DVM of Sphaeronectes irregularis was irregular and independent of diel light patterns. Though low in numbers, some calycophorans were found above the thermocline at night. For mesopelagic species, however, higher summer surface temperatures proved an effective barrier to migration above 100 m. Thus, certain species could be represented as key species of planktonic cnidarians assemblages found within a certain depth range. Though not homogenous, and while some undertake nocturnal migrations in both directions, all are interrelated by preferences of bathymetric distribution and specific DVM behavior.",

Results from mercury speciation studies in marine organisms are used to describe the extent of mercury bioaccumulation in the Adriatic Sea. Mercury biogeochemical cycle in the Adriatic is characterised by increased mercury concentrations from the water column, through plankton, bivalves and smaller fish to predator fish species. Although the Adriatic Sea has the highest mercury concentration in the whole Mediterranean Sea, fish species at the higher trophic levels have similar mercury concentrations everywhere in the Mediterranean, indicating incomplete understanding of the transfer mechanisms of mercury from seawater to upper trophic levels. As consumption of (contaminated) food is the main route of human exposure to mercury, it is of great importance to understand the influence of mercury contamination in the Adriatic Sea.",

Twenty-five stations from five different stressed sites were sampled in June-July 2014. Thirty-four zooplankton taxa were recorded, in addition to the larvae of copepods and meroplankton. Copepoda was the most abundant group among which, Oithona nana, Euterpina acutifrons, and Parvocalanus cirrostratus were the most frequent. The calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus trihamatus is a new record for the Mediterranean Sea that may have been introduced via ballast water. Multivariate/Univariate analyses demonstrated that 1) the environmental variables and zooplankton communities represented significant differences among five sites; 2) the spatial variations of community structure were undoubtedly due to land-based effluents; and 3) among all environmental variables, salinity and phytoplankton biomass had the major determining effects on the spatial patterns of zooplankton categories. The results indicates that not only the discharged water makes the Damietta coast at risk, but also the ballast water is not less dangerous. Hence, we emphasize the need for activation of the ballast water management to reduce the risk of future species invasions.",

This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a thorough overview of all conducted studies, emphasising the methodologies employed, and comparing representative values. The first section introduces the history of primary production measurements and gives insights into the Adriatic basin’s hydrography and its impact on primary producers and their rates of production. The second section provides an overview of productivity across the geographical regions of the Adriatic Sea. The Middle Adriatic Sea stands out as one of the rare locations in the world where in situ measurements of primary production have been systematically conducted since the 1960s and are ongoing. This data has only recently been synthesised and corrected for overestimates using a modelling approach. The final section is an overview of all primary production studies supported with comprehensive summarising tables. Most of the data concerns phytoplanktonprimary production estimated by 14C method. Annual primary production in the Northern and Middle Adriatic ranges between 87.4–260.0 g C m-2 y-1, and 70.0–177.4 g C m-2 y-1, respectively. Southern Adriatic Sea is the least investigated, and only daily estimates are available (236–374 mg C m-2 d-1). The purpose of this review is to highlight the significance of measuring primary production in the Adriatic Sea and the need for future research that will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the basin’s productivity.",

    "abstract": "The school shark, Galeorhinus galeus, is commonly captured off the Maghreb shore along the Algerian and Tunisian coasts of the southern Mediterranean. Of 517 specimens collected during more than twenty years, the smallest adult male was 1225 mm total length (TL) and weighed 11 580 g, the largest adult male was 1580 mm and weighed 18 000 g, and the heaviest male was 1570 mm and weighed 19 900 g. All males above 1260 mm TL were adult. Adult females were 1400-1900 mm TL. The smallest pregnant female was 1400 mm TL and carried developing embryos. The largest female was 1990 mm TL and weighed 27 900 g. Females were generally heavier than males, but there was no significant difference between males and females in mass versus total length relationship. Two ovulation and two pupping seasons occurred in winter and in spring. Gestation was estimated at twelve months, with most females appearing to reproduce in alternate years. The diameter of the largest yolky oocyte ranged 43-47 mm (mean 44.7±1.8) and the mass ranged 45-52 g (mean 47.9±2.2). Both uteri were compartmentalized into chambers and a single embryo developed in each chamber. Length and weight at birth, based on near-term embryos, were estimated at 240-320 mm TL and 88-109 g. The chemical balance of development, based on the mean dry mass of the largest yolky oocytes and of near-term fetuses, was about 1, showing that G. galeus can be considered as an incipient histotrophic species. Ovarian fecundity was higher than uterine fecundity. Litter sizes ranged 8-41. Males generally outnumbered females, especially among free-swimming adult specimens.",

Eighty-six of 254 stations that were studied between 1990 and 1999 weresampled and 59 species belonging to 49 genera and 28 families were identified. These species are listed together with 205 previously recorded species. Also listed are the primary hydrographic conditions (salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen) of the stations at the moment of sampling. The fact that fewer species were found than in earlier reports indicates the negative impact on species richness of habitats damaged by new ports and motorways on the edge of the sea plus domestic and industrial pollution.",

Adult males and females were mainly captured from March to September. The smallest adult male was 840 mm total length (TL) and weighed 2650 g; all males above 950 mm TL were adult. The smallest adult female was 890 mm TL and 4800 g; all females above 1000 mm were adult. The largest male and female were 1215 mm and 1260 mm TL and 6700 g and 6830 g, respectively. There was a significant difference in the total mass vs. TL relationship between males and females. Parturition and mating occurred in May and June. Gestation lasted approximately one year. Females had an annual reproductive cycle although some reproduced in alternate years. The diameter and mass of the largest yolked oocytes ranged 20-23 mm (mean 21.2±0.9) and 4.1-5.6 g (mean 4.8±0.5). Both uteri were compartmentalized into chambers with a single embryo in each chamber.

A chemical balance of development based on mean dry mass of the largest yolked oocytes and term embryos was 23. Ovarian fecundity was slightly higher than uterine fecundity. There was a slight positive relationship between uterine fecundity and female TL, but not between ovarian fecundity and female TL. Litter sizes ranged from one to eight (mean 3.5±1.3) with males and females equally distributed.

Thin-lipped mullet appeared in the Port of PlaCe in February. The relationships between total length, standard length, and weight showed a remarkably good fit to the expected allometric model, with b=3 for total length. Twelve different animal food categories were identified. The greatest diversity was recorded in April at the Port of PloCe when 10 categories were present. In addition, six diatom taxa were noted. Harpacticoid copepods were the most common prey (39%) in these samples, followed by insects (32%) and cladocerans (12%). All other prey accounted for less than 4%. Insects represented 99% of prey in the stomachs of specimens sampled from the freshwater Crna Rijeka River. Thin-lipped mullet juveniles were not found on sandy beaches or natural bays around the port. It thus appears that juveniles find the port area to be a habitat with the favorable characteristics of a brackish water nursery: of predators, lower salinity, and high food availability. These all promote better survival and recruitment in this area of the Croatian Adriatic.",

    "abstract": "Vertical flux regulation was investigated in the small, shallow, marine and partly anoxic Lake Rogoznica (eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea) by studying plankton composition, zooplankton fecal pellet (FP) production and vertical carbon flux. The lake is naturally eutrophicated with high nutrient and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations and relatively low species diversity. However, the few species found can be highly abundant. Due to a simple ecological structure and low physical forcing, Lake Rogoznica may be regarded as a natural laboratory especially suitable for plankton studies. Only one copepod species, Acartia italica, was found in the lake and had a maximal abundance of 140 animals L -1 . The mixotrophic dinoflagellate Ceratium furca and the diatom Chaetoceros curvisetus accounted for ∼90% of the phytoplankton biomass. Phytoplankton made up 30% of the POC flux at 5 m and 10% at 10 m depth and was dominated by C. curvisetus and C. furca. Average export of POC was 730 ± 40 mg m -2 d' at 5 m and 750 ± 90 mg m -2 d' at 10 m depth, and detritus comprised 68 and 86 % at 5 and 10 m depth, respectively. Despite high copepod abundance and high suspended FP concentration, FP only contributed 4 - 5% of the vertical POC flux. The highest contribution to vertical carbon flux was in terms of detritus, and high retention was likely due to FP grazing or fragmentation by A. italica copepodites above 5 m depth. It is concluded that Lake Rogoznica is a productive system where organic material is rapidly transformed to detritus.",

Meristic and morphometric data of the silver-cheeked toadfish and blunthead puffer are in accordance with data from the Mediterranean. The specimen of silver-cheeked toadfish was a female with gonad in resting stage and the specimens of blunthead puffer were adults (male and female) with gonads in maturing, mature/spawner and post-spawning stage. The stomach contents of the specimen of silver-cheeked toadfish were composed by Mollusca Opistobranchia and Crustacea Brachyura. Stomach contents analysis of S. pachygaster confirmed that Mollusca are the preferred prey for this species. However, the presence of Crustacea (shrimps, crabs) and fish in the stomachs indicates that the blunthead puffer has a broad and variable diet in the south Adriatic Sea. The present study suggests the presence of an established population of blunthead puffer on the continental shelf of the southeast Adriatic Sea.",

    "abstract": "We present for the first time composition, numerical abundance and vertical structure of micro- and mesozooplankton in the Albanian coastal and open sea region. Zooplankton was sampled at six stations on the 75-km long continental shelf slope transect in May 2009. The most numerous microzooplankton were copepod nauplii (maximum: 39 ind. L-1), followed by calonoid and cyclopoid copepodites (maxima: 5 and 4 ind. L-1, respectively). The most abundant of fourteen tintinnid species was Tintinnopsis radix, found in the surface to 50 m layer. The species composition of the coastal and open sea mesozooplankton was similar to that previously reported for the south Adriatic Sea. The copepod Oithona similis was the dominant species at all stations, followed by Oithona plumifera, Acartia clausi, Paracalanus parvus, Oithona nana and Cyclopoida-oncaeids at the shallower coastal stations, and Clausocalanus pergens, Oithona plumifera and Oithona nana offshore. Mesozooplankton diversity rose considerably from the coast to the open sea. Mesozooplankton abundance exhibited the opposite trend, with the maximum (2286 ind. m-3) noted at the shallowest station. Findings of typically open sea tintinnid and copepod species at the coastal station indicate the high influence of currents from the open sea area during our investigation. Our results suggest the low influence of fresh water on zooplankton population densities, even at the shallow stations where penetration of fresh water in the surface layers was notable.",

Particularly high ecological vulnerability of Rijeka Bay is due to its geospatial characteristics as semi-enclosed basin. The simulated onemonth sea surface velocity field of Rijeka Bay was analyzed using Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) to assess the diffusion and chaotic advection of passive pollutants (dye). LCSs were extracted by the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE), hypergraphs, Lagrangian advection alone and advection-diffusion methods. Results show relatively complex nonstationary flow dynamics in Rijeka Bay. Areas of ridges and valleys of FTLE fields spread in north-south and northeast-southwest directions, and they move toward east. Similarly, the hypergraphs method shows areas of attraction and areas of mixing that can be observed in stripes that stretch in directions north-south and northeast-southwest. In addition, the stripes of mesohyperbolic area spread toward east. To assess the potential of passive pollutant spreading, Gaussian pollutant source was simulated at the middle of the bay. The pollutant spreads in the same direction (north-south and northeast-southwest) with lateral diffusion of material proportional to diffusion coefficient.",

In view of the risk of exposure to it from the environment and diet, and basically as a water pollutant, the objective of our study was to assess possible effects on ionic regulation after exposure to BPA by means of a histopathological and morphometric study of the chloride and prolactin cells in zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an experimental model. Twenty-five male 16-week old zebrafish (Danio rerio) were allocated randomly into 5 study groups (n=5/group); a control group, and four groups, exposed for 2 weeks to a concentration of (1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg/L) of BPA, respectively. After 2 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and samples of their gills and pituitary gland were immediately taken for their subsequent histopathological analysis. Our results showed how, in the first study groups, lesions appeared in chloride cells, generating compensatory modifications in the prolactin cells, which were enough to maintain stability in the ionic exchange. As the exposure concentration increased, more serious histological modifications occurred. In the groups with the highest concentration (100 and 1000 μg/L), the lesions were so severe that the prolactin cells underwent some degenerative processes, which probably prevented the compensatory action at gill level.",

Until recently, there has been no research on the species in the Croatian part of the Adriatic. The aim of this research was to summarize existing and novel data on the distribution of M. gigas in coastal areas of the Eastern Adriatic and to provide a baseline for the future monitoring and assessment programmes of the species. Distribution of M. gigas was determined by three different methods: (i) a visual census of the presence of M. gigas specimens in the medio-littoral zone; (ii) DNA identification of M. gigas larvae in the water column; and (iii) the presence of M. gigas in the subtidal zone at depth between 25 and 40 m. Magallana gigas has a well-established population in the medio-littoral zone of natural and anthropogenic habitats along the coast of the North-eastern Adriatic Sea (west coast of Istria peninsula), but it is not present in the deeper layers . In the Central-eastern and South-eastern Adriatic Sea, the species was either absent or sporadically recorded with no evidence of fully established populations. Considering the great invasion success of M. gigas worldwide and effects that this species could have on the invaded ecosystem (e.g. competition for food and space with native species), detailed future monitoring is needed for the Eastern Adriatic Sea.",

Remote sensing techniques, particularly synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are used to detect oil slicks on the sea surface. In such a way two groups of oil slicks have been detected in the Northern and Central Adriatic Sea on the SAR images acquired by the European Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites in 2017-2018. Analysis of SAR images together with bathymetry, geological and geophysical data in geographic information system (GIS) have shown that these oil slicks, visible on the sea surface have natural origin, i.e. are seepage phenomena, associated to existing marine hydrocarbon systems. These oil slicks were concentrated over the shallow shelf, and repeatedly or episodically occur in the areas of interest, and are related to local oil-and-gas bearing sediments. Findings of the seeps and seep candidates that passed unnoticed from public attention indicate the effectiveness of the approach used. Finally, it is concluded that the frequent SAR imagery is an excellent tool for monitoring of seepage phenomena, and the results indicate that the use of remote sensing methods can be considered as a good approach to support oil and gas exploration in the Adriatic Basin.",

Seiches are pertinent throughout the year, but their maximum amplitude doubles (up to 25 cm) during the summer. Modeling studies showed that seiches are primarily a result of incoming waves from the open sea, generated by resonant coupling with air pressure traveling waves. In contrast, direct wind forcing has a minor influence on seiche generation. Seiches endanger ferries and small moored boats as well as large cargo ships in harbors where strong currents (greater than 50 cm s -1 ) appear during extreme events.",

    "abstract": "The middle Adriatic coastal area was numerically modeled with a 1 km resolution in order to simulate temperature, salinity and currents. The model employed was a modification of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), forced with surface momentum, heat and water fluxes and discharges from four rivers: Jadro, Žrnovnica, Cetina and Neretva. The coastal model was nested into the whole-Adriatic model having a 5 km resolution, using a simple off-line one-way nesting technique. Results of a three-year long experiment with perpetual atmospheric and river forcing were characterized by a strong annual signal, in reasonable agreement with temperature and salinity data taken at permanent oceanographic stations along the Split-Gargano transect. Current reversal obtained between the islands of Hvar and Vis in summer also agreed with previous measurements. The simulation also revealed the way Dalmatian islands - in particular Lastovo and Vis - influence the East Adriatic Current prevailing in winter, with wakes being formed behind the islands and jets among them. Comparison of an interannual simulation with corresponding measurements showed good agreement for temperature, whereas a discrepancy in salinity was related to the model being forced with climatological water fluxes. Experimental forecasts, produced over a six-month period, enabled some experience to be gained in operational oceanography, but also pointed to an additional problem - the model overmixing when the wind forcing is pronounced. Moreover, low spatial resolution of atmospheric forcing was suspected of reducing the quality of current forecasts for some wind directions.",

A box model has been applied for the estimation of residence time of the lake, forced by tides only at the open end of the lake system. The residence time of Little Lake was estimated to be 54 days. In our approach we assumed that P. nobilis larvae may be found in the surface waters only during the night, thus restricting their outgoing from the lake to about 7-8 hours per day in the June-August period, as the larvae need some time to reach surface waters. Therefore, the equivalent residence time of the larvae in Little Lake is estimated to be about 160-185 days. Knowing that the bivalve larva phase lasts between 3 and 5 weeks, one may estimate that only 11 to 22% of the larvae, respectively, leave Little Lake. From a conservation standpoint these low values imply a special level of protection within Mljet National Park. In addition, future climatic changes will affect the recruitment of P. nobilis, not only due to sea level rise but also with temperature and other changes which may influence its reproduction phase and larvae transport.",

A total of 194 specimens were analysed, of which 93 were juveniles and 101 were adults. Juvenile individuals ranged from 5.7 to 8.4 cm while adults ranged from 39.3 to 56.7 cm. In order to analyse biometry, nine morphometric characters were analysed. Length-length equations for overall converted body lengths of fish were linear. Comparison of length-length relationships between juvenile and adult specimens showed statistically significant differences in almost all morphometric characteristics, except for the fork length–second dorsal fin base. Females insignificantly prevailed in adults. Overall gonads were in post-spawning state. Juveniles were unsexed. Length-weight relationships of juveniles and adults were W = 0.0033LF 3.424 and W = 0.0149LF 2.984 , respectively.",

The qualitative and quantitative composition of nematofauna was studied at three northern Adriatic offshore sites associated with circalittoral zone and detritic bottom communities. The study involved the main population parameters (density, dominance, constancy) and community attributes (taxonomic composition, abundance, species richness, evenness, diversity, faunistic affinity). From 57 samples collected over a period of two years 12 350 Nematoda specimens were retrieved and subjected to spatial analysis. The results of multivariate analyses indicate high faunistic similarity, both from the qualitative (QS=68-76%) and quantitative aspects (QS=48-56%). The mutual intersection of k-dominance curves suggested the same trend of distribution of individuals per species at all sites investigated. In all, 168 free-living nematode species, comprising 101 genera and 29 families, were recorded. The area investigated is distinguished by considerable taxonomic diversity and respectable species richness (60% of total nematofauna species) in comparison to other Adriatic regions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing urban and industrial development in coastal areas our knowledge on direct consequences of coastal modifications on benthic communities is still limited. The aim of the present study was to assess the response of rocky macrozoobenthos mediolittoral communities to human-induced hydromorphological pressures. Sampling was carried out by SCUBA diving and snorkeling in June 2008. Ten sites were selected along a gradient of hydromorphological alterations in the southern part of the Gulf of Trieste. Variables used to describe the stressor gradient were: water retention (from normal hydrology in unprotected coast to closed areas with only one opening), substrate composition, texture and rugosity. Despite natural differences between upper and lower mediolittoral subbelts, the present work showed that human-induced alterations of the coastal zone impact biological assemblages. There was a marked difference in biodiversity among sites with pristine conditions and stressed zones, mainly due to evenness of species distribution. Structural complexity of the substrate resulted to be the main factor influencing benthic diversity in the upper mediolittoral subbelt, while in the lower subbelt also the human-induced water retention seemed to play a key role. Anyhow, this response was complex, and the major human-induced alterations considered had different level of pressure within the two subbelts. The current study has a good potential to contribute to existing coastal assessment methods, since the impact of hydromorphological pressures on mediolittoral communities was almost neglected in the past. However, further work is needed to fully explain the impact of main human-induced threats on benthic communities. ISSN: 0001-5113 AADRAY ACTA ADRIAT., 54(1): 67 86, 2013",

For groundwater characterization, we used the \\(^18 O\\) isotope. This stable isotope, together with 2 H, proved to be a useful physical, naturally occurring tracer primarily due to its abundance variations at different stages of water cycle. Test locations include Bakar Bay and selected adjacent Rijeka city beaches (Croatia). To test for statistical associations, we used the Panel Data Pairwise Granger Causality test. At examined locations, we found statistically significant relationships between the amount of rainfall and the abundance of \\(^18 O\\) isotope in groundwater, as well as relationships between the abundance of \\(^18 O\\) isotope in groundwater and faecal bacteria concentrations. Accordingly, \\(^18 O\\) isotope, when used as an indicator for the functioning of karstic groundwater systems, may also be used as the predictor of faecal contamination of bathing waters in associated karst littoral areas. We believe this physical method could be a valuable addition to present methods of predicting microbiological contamination and economic allocation of stock and flow pollutants in scarce common pool resources as fresh water basins, springs and beaches.",

Samples were collected four times from three stations in the inner part of the Bay between April 2008 and March 2009. Microscopic analysis revealed that the phytoplankton was composed of marine diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptophytes, chlorophytes and coccolithophorids. Aside from fucoxanthin as the dominant biomarker pigment, alloxanthin, 19′-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, peridinin and chlorophyll b provided indicative contributions. Fucoxanthin and alloxanthin showed significant correlation with the phytoplankton chlorophyll a biomass throughout the investigated period. In November 2008, the diatoms were outcompeted by coccolithophorids, which probably efficiently absorbed nutrients during a period of their reduced supply. Due to the reduced nutrient input, in the summer, the phytoplankton community in the Bay was composed mostly of marine dinoflagellates, cryptophytes, and chlorophytes.",

This kind of monitoring is of interest since such areas have not been addressed well using the usual satellite methods (such as MODIS) due to inadequate spatial resolution. We present an estimation approach for Chl-a concentration based on Landsat 8 (L8) satellite images using the ground truth (GT) data for the day of overflight. Additionally, two classifiers (daily and yearly) of the state of eutrophication, that use the Chl-a estimated values, are presented. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation, and it is within limits theoretically expected of an L8-based approach. The results from the classifiers are compared with the GT data and it is shown that daily classifier is able to classify the area of interest with an incidence of false positives less than 2%.",

Maximum values were recorded in September 1.025 for females and 1.029 for males. Gonadosomatic index and histological examination showed that the spawning season of the bogue in the Adriatic is from January to May with peak in February. Six stages of gonad development were identified: immature, undergoing maturation, ripening, ripe, spawning and spent. The monthly distribution of the different sexual maturity stages and the frequency distribution of oocyte diameter revealed that this species is a batch spawner.",

We summarised research results of mercury speciation in order to describe its presence and fate in the Adriatic Sea. The Adriatic Sea represents a net source of mercury to the Mediterranean Sea due to the highest total mercury concentrations observed in the North Adriatic Sea and the highest methylmercury concentrations in the South Adriatic Pit. However, the biogeochemical cycle of mercury is not completely known and our understanding of mercury transport between compartments and its (bio)transformations is limited. Future research needs to focus on microbial and chemical processes of mercury transformations to improve our understanding of the impacts of mercury contamination on the environment and human health in the Adriatic Sea.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial and heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) abundance, production, growth and grazing rates were studied monthly from January 1995 to December 1997 along the trophic gradient in the middle Adriatic Sea. The role of substrate supply (expressed as a slope of the linear regression of bacterial abundance on bacterial production), bacterivory and temperature in controlling bacterial abundance were studied with respect to the spatial (trophic) and seasonal scales. The most significant relationship between bacterial abundance and production was established in the oligotrophic area, and during the winter-spring period suggesting that substrate supply could be the most important factor in bacterial control. On the other hand, inconsistent relationship between bacterial abundance and productivity in the eutrophic area and during the summer-autumn period suggests conditions in which substrate supply is above saturating level, or in which mortality factors such as bacterivory and viral lysis are very strong. Variability on the trophic and seasonal scales is shown by two ratios, bacterial production/bacterial biomass (P/B) and bacterial abundance/HNF abundance (B/HNF), which appeared to be good indicators of the control of bacterial dynamics. Variations of P/B ratio were more influenced by the trophic scale which explained 32% of the total variability in comparison to seasonal scale which explained 21%, whilst B/HNF ratio were more influenced by seasonal scale (71% of variability). Furthermore, both the scales interacted, and their interactions explained the significant part (31% and 15% of P/B and B/HNF ratios variability, respectively) of the observed variability in the spatial-temporal continuum. The degree of dependency of bacterial abundance on temperature varied over different trophic and temperature ranges. The control of bacterial abundance by temperature decreased from the eutrophic to the oligotrophic area, thus, control by temperature was negatively correlated with control by substrate supply. This suggests that in eutrophic area substrate set an upper limit for bacterial abundance, whilst other factors like temperature, predation pressure and/or viral lysis determine the level of realized abundance, particularly during summer. Furthermore, temperature was an important factor in controlling bacterial abundance during the nonsummer period (temperature < 20oC) when temperature and substrate supply acted synergistically. In contrast to trophic scale, on the seasonal scale the control of bacterial abundance by substrate supply was positively correlated with their control by temperature.",

    "abstract": "The coastal seabed around the northern Adriatic islands of Prvic, Sv. Grgur, and Goli have remained little researched until recently. Therefore, we compiled here results of our studies on macroflora, fauna, and bottom communities. The benthos was surveyed by scuba diving at 26 sites and a fish census taken at 14 of them. Bottom trammel nets were used at 15 sites to document the structure and status of fish populations. Deep deposits were sampled by bottom grabs at 27 sites. Fifty-six species of macroalgae, two marine phanerogams, 218 invertebrates, and 96 fish species were recorded. The most significant hard bottom communities were the biocoenosis of infralittoral seaweeds and the coralligenous biocoenosis. Deep deposits were characterized by elements of the biocoenoses of coastal terrigenous ooze and bathyal silts. Due to hydrodynamic conditions, there was a spatial mixture of populations peculiar to various communities. Scuba diving is a very suitable method for rapid identification and evaluation of infralittoral benthos. However, fish assemblages can be satisfactorily estimated only by compiling diving records and analyzing fishing gear catches. Although results of our research reflect the study methods, it is evident that the benthic communities and fish assemblages in this area are very diverse and well preserved. Therefore, we again propose protecting the Senj Archipelago coastal seabed within the category of a special marine reserve, i.e. marine park.",

The higher concentrations in suspended matter were associated with lower concentrations in the sediments, which indicated that sediment resuspension has an important role in the distribution of Cd between sediments and suspended matter. The spatial distribution of Cd in the sediment and suspended matter of Kastela Bay was in accordance with the prevailing circulation in the bay and indicated a partially anthropogenic origin of Cd. The vertical distribution revealed a decrease of Cd concentration with sediment depth, which also indicated an anthropogenic origin.

At the investigated area of Sibenik Bay a total of 114 phytoplankton taxa have been determined. The most diverse were diatoms with 61 and dinoflagellates with 37 taxa. Coccolithophorids contributed with 6, cryptophytes with 3, silicoflagellates, euglenophytes and chlorophytes with 2 taxa. In the area of Kastela Bay 193 phytoplankton taxa have been recorded. Dinoflagellate group was the most diverse with 92 taxa, followed by diatoms (80), coccolithophorids (9), silicoflagellates and euglenophytes (4), cryptophytes (2) and chlorophyte (1). In the area of Mali Ston Bay a total of 88 phytoplankton taxa have been found, with 39 diatoms, 36 dinoflagellates, 2 silicoflagellates, 4 coccolithophorids, 2 euglenophytes, 1 chllorophyte and 3 chrisophyte taxa. Abundance of dinoflagellates was very low in this area. Coccolithophorids contributed more to the community composition in Mali Ston Bay, then in other areas of research. A diverse microflagellate group was present in the whole area of investigation with a high frequency of findings. During the investigated period a relatively small number of monospecific blooms in all areas have been recorded. The largest numbers of taxa were recorded at stations that are under an influence of freshwater input from rivers and strong anthropogenic influence.",

    "abstract": "Conventional narratives explain fish migrations in term of requirements (food, mates, habitats, etc.), with adequate temperatures being optional. Here, using the example of a (commercially extinct) stock of Black Sea mackerel (Scomber scombrus), we suggest that seasonal migrations are driven by seasonal temperature cycles. Therein, temperature acts as a constraint determining where the fish can be at any given time, and not a one of several factors which they would consider when choosing between alternative migration routes. Generalizing, we suggest that temperature should generally be an explicit part of hypotheses about the migratory behaviours of marine fishes. For illustration of what may occur when this is not the case, it is suggested that the non-consideration of temperature in a model of North Atlantic mackerel migration may have led, among the researchers concerned, to a sense of complacency with respect to the climate change-induced changes in the phenology of this fish in the North Atlantic, whose distribution and migration are misleadingly seen as “stochastic”.",

In June at least 2/3 of females were ovigerous. Estimated mean incubation period was 31 days. We determined four periods in relation to the species’ reproductive activity. Early reproductive period (April) was characterised by emergence of first ovigerous females, while main reproductive period (May–July) was characterised by peak of reproduction.

    "abstract": "The structure and composition of Mediterranean biodiversity has changed significantly. So far, in Montenegrin coastal waters, nine new non-native species have been recorded: Tylosurus acus imperialis, Caranx crysos, Siganus luridus, Fistularia commersonii, Stephanolepis diaspros, Sphoeroides pachygaster, Lagocephalus sceleratus, Callinectes sapidus and Farfantepanaeus aztecus. Allochthonous species are starting to compete for food and space and leading to habitat degradation, socio-economic impacts and can hybridise with the native species. Natural factors and human activities have enabled the arrival of non-native species into the Adriatic Sea. Four of the species are Lessepsian immigrants, which arrived via the Suez Canal, but five others were introduced from the Atlantic Ocean, through the Strait of Gibraltar. Analysis using the Marine Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (MFISK), Aquatic Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK) and Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) showed a calibration threshold of 22.5 for MFISK, a BRA (Basic Risk Assessment) score of 34 and a CCA (Climate Change Assessment) score of 46. A measure of the accuracy of the calibration analysis is the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Two species were characterised as non-invasive: Tylosurus acus imperialis and Caranx crysos, but five others were characterised as invasive and covered by the categories from moderate to high-risk.",

Several anatomical and morphological features (genital apertures and clamps sclerites) are described and illustrated. We provide morpho-anatomical and morphometrical data, along with detailed illustrations of A. belones , and we discuss the host specificity of A. belones . Notes on hosts and localities of this species and other congeners are presented, and host specificity patterns of A. belones revealed stenoxenic specificity to Belonidae Bonaparte, 1835, whilst the genus Axine Abildgaard, 1794 seems to be restricted to fishes of the order Beloniformes. Our attempt to investigate morphometric variations between Mediterranean and oceanic specimens revealed that the two populations differed by the number of testes, body length, and clamp dimensions. However, the limited number of measured organs in the various accounts precluded any distinction between the populations. Molecular data for both Mediterranean and oceanic specimens are needed to determine the existence of cryptic species.",

The classification was based on the variations of air and surface water temperatures. Four water masses were observed during winter; (i) the surface water mass of temperature 17-19 °C, salinity maximum 39.0->39.2 occupies the upper 200 m layer, (ii) the Levantine intermediate water mass of temperature 15-17 °C and salinity 38.8-39.0 occupies depths between 200 and 400 m, (iii) a mid-depth water mass lies between 400 an 800 m of temperature 14-15 °C and salinity range 38.75-38 and (iv) the deep water mass of potential temperature range 13.3-13.5 °C, salinity 38.6-38.75 and density ∼29.1 σ t . By analyzing the water temperature and salinity distributions, we found that the average surface water temperature are 18.88 °C and 16.73 °C during the warm and cold winters, respectively with an average difference of 2.1 °C. The difference reached the maximum value of 2.32 °C at 50 m depth. It decreases with increasing depth to reach 0.12 °C at 200 m depth. At the depth of 250-500 m, the difference was negative and varied between -0.42 and -0.17 °C. The difference of average salinity at the surface was about 0.07 and decreased to reach 0.03 at 50 m depth. At depth of 100 m and down to 500 m, the difference values were negative and varied between -0.03 and -0.09. Vertically, the variations in the water temperature and salinity were observed not only on the surface, but also to a deeper layers (>200 m). The surface layer (0-150 m) represents a water mass of high positive temperature difference (up to 2.5 °C) and low positive salinity difference (∼0.06). The intermediate layer showed a nuclei of negative difference (-1.4°C and -0.2 salinity) in the eastern side of the study area at depth of 200-300 m.",

The Mediterranean records have been documented for the Ligurian Sea, the Levant Sea close to Rhodes, off the Sardinian coasts and for the northern Ionian Sea south of the Straits of Messina. Additional reports referred its presence in the Alboran Sea, in the southern Adriatic Sea and west of Malta, though without any additional information. The present paper reports the occurrence of G. granti in the Adriatic Sea (eastern Mediterranean) thanks to the examination of eight specimens collected in its south-western part, between February 1997 and October 2017. Six of them had been trawled at depths from 190 to 290 m, mainly in a channel within coral banks, while two were caught by hook at 420 m depth on coral banks. Their total length ranged from 21.0 to 32.3 cm. Four dissected individuals were adult, three males and one female. The stomach of two individuals contained only galatheid shrimps of the genus Munida, some of which were identified as M. rutllanti . According to interviews with fishermen based in the area where G. granti specimens were trawled, this conspicuous fish was unknown to them until the 1997 captures. Afterwards, it became well known to all of them, because few specimens are presently caught every once in a while. It is discussed whether G. granti is a native Mediterranean species or a fish that entered this sea a few decades ago. Both hypotheses have some support. The autochthonous origin hypothesis is mainly based on both G. granti distribution throughout the Mediterranean and its unavailability to old fishing gear uncapable of fishing on deep, rough grounds. The contrasting allochthonous hypothesis is backed by the total lack of Mediterranean records prior to 1989 coupled with its quite long larval pelagic phase.",

Our description of the D. lobata blooms are actually the first known records of blooms for this species. C. tuberculata was observed in the Bay principally in August and September. The bloom was occurred only in 2017, being the first information of C. tuberculata mass appearance in this area. We hypothesized that global warming phenomena could trigger the observed changes, and in this respect, long-term trends of sea surface temperature (SST) fluctuations were analysed. The scyphomedusae blooms coincided with high positive SST anomalies, noted in the last seven years for this area. To better understand the mechanisms underlying changes in their phenology and abundance, detailed studies on benthic stages in the Bay are essential.",

Samples were obtained from commercial purse seine catches (April 2014 – September 2016) from coastal and offshore fishing areas of different trophic states and zooplankton composition over the eastern Adriatic Sea. In general, decapod larvae comprise the main source of diet during the anchovies’ spawning period in terms of frequency and abundance, followed by calanoid copepods. The main copepod prey that was identified for anchovy along the eastern Adriatic coast was calanoid Temora stylifera, followed by Oncaeid copepods and Corycaeidae. Although no significant differences in diet composition regarding the anchovy’s size was observed, the contribution of copepods decreased in larger individuals, and were gradually substituted by large crustaceans - decapods, euphausiids, mysids and amphipods. However, a significant difference in prey composition between coastal and offshore areas was observed (global R=0.164, p&amp;lt;0.05). Beside adult copepods, offshore water anchovy fed mainly on decapod larvae and their megalopa stage, and amphipods. In the stomach of the fish caught in the coastal waters, higher contributions of euphausiids, mysids and fish eggs were observed. Prey diversity was greater in the stomach of specimens caught offshore (H’=0.59) than in the coastal Adriatic waters (H’=0.40).",

    "abstract": "In the attempt to identify an appropriate molecular marker which will enable genetic distinction between different Cystoseira species from the Adriatic Sea, two mitochondrial molecular markers were tested: the mt 23S rDNA and the mt23S-tRNAVal spacer. Two species were studied: Cystoseira spinosa and Cystoseira squarrosa. Sequence analyses showed no variation in the mt 23S rDNA among all individuals analyzed. But the analysis of the mt23S-tRNAVal spacer showed a differentiation between three haplotypes named A, B and C. The most abundant haplotype A was found in equal number in both species, while haplotype B was found only in C. spinosa and haplotype C was found in C. squarrosa only. However, when comparing to sequences available for several selected Mediterranean Cystoseira species, the mt23S-tRNAVal spacer failed to discriminate between species. Although these results indicate a limited use of the mitochondrial mt23S-tRNAVal intergenic spacer for discrimination among Adriatic Cystoseira species, they could also be interpreted as a sign of conspecificity of the investigated species or the reflection of a recent radiation. Further analysis will be necessary to improve molecular identification of these brown algae.",

Samples were collected at four sites characterized by different trophic states. Cell abundance, carbon content, and size categories of the oligotrich ciliates were investigated. NLC abundance was highest in spring with average values of 400-608 ind.l-1. Abundance during the second highest period, autumn-winter, was less pronounced. In the eutrophicated part of the bay, conditions were most favorable for NLC proliferation in summer, with the highest average density (1430± 1348 ind.l-1) in August 1998. The size structure of the NLC populations changed with the trophic gradient. Organisms of <104 μ m3 were useful in distinguishing trophic conditions in the marine ecosystem. Eutrophication favored growth of organisms of <104 μ m3 while the succession of NLC categories changed without a clear seasonal pattern. Eutrophication also increased NLC biomass and affected seasonal fluctuations of biomass values. Average monthly biomass values ranged from 0.012± 0.014 to 3.925± 5.094 μ gC l-1. The high abundance and biomass in Kastela Bay suggest that NLC play a critical role in the secondary production of the area.",

    "abstract": "Croatia has a fishing fleet of 7559 vessels. Of these, small-scale coastal fishing boats, less than 12 meters in length, makes up 95,7% of the fleet. However, the largest percentage of catches, more than 94%, is made by purse-seiners that are representing only 3% of total fishing vessels. These vessels target small pelagic fish, predominately sardine and anchovy. This paper describes all the technical characteristics of the Croatian purse seiner fleet, based on 113 purse seine vessels registe-red in 6 Croatian ports and targeting anchovy in order to allow a precise determination of that fleet fishing capacity and subsequent management of the fleet in a responsible and sustainable manner. Comparison of different technical characteristics showed that the length of a vessel corresponds to the amount of the catch as well as to size of the fish. Hence, results confirm superiority of sonar, as a fish-finding device, over sounder in detecting fish shoals, which is prerequisite for purse seine fishing.",

The objective of this investigation was to contribute to the understanding of size structure of zooplankters ingested by four commercially important bivalve species co-occurring in the same area. The study was performed in Mali Ston Bay – the most important bivalve aquaculture area in the eastern Adriatic Sea – from May 2009 to April 2010. We analyzed sizes of zooplankton ingested by cultured blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and European flat oyster Ostrea edulis, and naturally-occurring bearded mussel Modiolus barbatus and Noah’s Ark shell Arca noae. Ingested zooplankton ranged in maximum linear dimension from 60.1 to 1398.5 μm. Zooplankton found in stomach contents of M. galloprovincialis and O. edulis suspended in the water column showed a wider size range than zooplankton found in stomachs of bottom living M. barbatus and A. noae. Sizes of ingested zooplankton significantly differed between O. edulis and the other three species.",

Three other older cases of catch of sixgill bluntnose sharks were recorded in Slovenia and the Gulf of Trieste. Among these, the finding of the specimen in the Lagoon of Marano and Grado is unusual although there are reported cases of sixgill bluntnose sharks in rivers. An analysis of the available data on the bluntnose sixgill shark in the Adriatic Sea, obtained from different published papers, social media and other sources, was done to understand whether the occurrence of H. griseus in the northern Adriatic differs from other parts. A generalised linear model (GLM) approach revealed that larger specimens are more frequently sighted across the Adriatic Sea, while in the Northern Adriatic part, significantly smaller specimens (juveniles) were recorded in comparison to the Central and Southern parts. It seems that the bluntnose sixgill shark is not in conjunction with a common large shark decreasing trend across the whole Mediterranean Sea.",

The monthly eel catches in ten traditional fyke nets in Parila lagoon varied from 4.4 to 12.7 kg (±2.45 kg) in 2016 and 2.4 to 9.6 kg (±2.01 kg) in 2019. There were no statistical differences between monthly and total weights recorded in 2016 and 2019 (t=1.04; p=0.312). The b-coefficient of the length-weight (LW) relationship for the freshwater eel samples varied from 3,1036 to 3,3206 duringtwo-year period of the sampling. The LW relationship for the brackish population was significantly lower (b-coefficient 2,6513). The dominant eel stage in both sites was yellow eel, while silver stage was scarce. The fishery with traditional devices revealed that efficiency of these artisanal tools is low, pointing to poor abundance of eel in their common habitats. The recorded catch using bigger traditional eel trap gear during autumn spawning migrations was also dominated with yellow stage, while silver eel represented only 15,4% of the catch. The infestation of eels with the parasite,Anguillicoloides crassus was significantly higher in freshwater habitat (41% of eel specimens infested) than in brackish, Parila lagoon (7%). Poor efficiency of traditional gear, bad length and weight structure of the population and low b-coefficients of eels in their most important habitat, indicate poor status of European eel population and River Neretva estuarine ecosystems.",

Marine yeasts occur in estuaries, coastal and open marine waters, sediments, and as epi- and endobionts of various marine organisms. This study focuses on the fermentation capabilities of marine yeasts isolated from the central Adriatic Sea for use in the brewing process. Sampling was performed at a sea temperature of 12°C to avoid collecting yeasts introduced into the marine environment by human activities. Four nutrient media designed for yeast isolation and growth were used to isolate yeasts from the marine samples: Yeast Malt Agar (YM), Yeast Malt Agar with antibiotics, acidified Yeast Malt Agar, and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar. Sixteen yeast colonies were successfully isolated, and only three were positive in the fermentationtest and were further determined to species level. Of the three species identified as capable of fermentation, Candida famata completely fermented the wort and produced a beer. Candida pelliculosa fermented slowly over an extended period and did not produce a usable beer, while Candida sake did not ferment the wort at all. To our knowledge, this is the first time that marine yeast isolates have been used experimentally for beer fermentation, indicating potential for use as nonconventionalyeasts in brewing and beer production. Further investigations should include professional standard fermentation, aroma and genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Chondrichthyans are considered a highly threatened marine species, due both to the intense fishing pressure they have experienced in the world’s Oceans over several decades, and other threats, such as habitat loss, climate change and marine pollution. A rapid decline in their populations could trigger significant negative changes in marine ecosystems, highlighting the need for improved conservation measures. This study analyzes the current state of this group in the waters of Montenegro (in the southeastern Adriatic Sea). The first national checklist is provided here, comprising of 44 species, with information on their occurrence frequencies in Montenegrin fishery catches. The dataset used consists of 1469 records obtained from 281 field samplings conducted as part of the official monitoring of commercial fisheries (DCF-DCRF) aswell as 1222 records derived from citizen science. The latter contributed significantly in documenting a greater number of species, particularly those considered threatened or rare in the region, and/or overlooked by DCF-DCRF monitoring. The frequency of species in Montenegrin catches is described based on the percentage of their records in the total number of records originating from local fisheries. The obtained results indicate that only 16% of the species recorded in Montenegro are commonly present in country’s catches, while 66% are either rare or not observed in local fishery. The creation of the country’s first checklist might contribute to overcoming drawbacks in national legislation and protection measures, notably by reporting the presence of endangered species in national marine waters.",

Benthic surveys conducted in 2018 in the hard-bottom infralittoral zone on the east coast of the central Adriatic Sea revealed one previously unreported species for the Adriatic Sea, Syllis kabilica Ben-Eliahu, 1977 (Syllidae), as well as two species reported for the first time in the eastern Adriatic Sea, Syllis tyrrhena (Licher and Kuper, 1998) (Syllidae), and Streblosoma nogueirai Lezzi and Giangrande, 2019 (Terebellidae). Furthermore, one alien species was identified, Lysidice collaris Grube, 1868 (Eunicidae). These findings provide new insights into the distribution and diversity of polychaete fauna in the Adriatic Sea.",

Pinna nobilis was absent from depths greather than 15 m, whilst Chlamys glabra has disappeared from all transects in 2001. Pinna nobilis and Chlamys glabra were measured in situ and size distribution changes were noted with respect to 2000 to 2001 and 1999 to 2000, respectivelly. The survey method employed in this study was non-destructive and relatively simple to perform and therefore it can be easily applied for monitoring long-term changes in bivalve distribution. distribution.",

The mineralization consists mainly ofFe impoverished 10-A tecto-manganate todorokite (enriched in Mg and transition metals) accompanied by accessory MnO-OH. Todorokite chemical composition is typical of a hydrogenous origin in an oxic shallow marine environment. According to our model, Mn has been recurrently leached and mobilized from the Late Pleistocene sea floor sediments located around 50 nautical miles south of Dugi Otok. We propose a link between the Mn-geochemical anomaly of these sediments and the alteration of distinct, spatial close pre-Holocene tephra, dispersed over the entire recent Adriatic area.",

During 15 months of observations we also recorded seasonal variability in P. arcuatum cell size. The optimum physical conditions for P. arcuatum proliferation were reached in autumn 2013, during the narrow temperature range between 19.6 oC – 20.4 oC, and salinity between 36.7 - 37.7. Despite the general similarity in physical conditions in autumn 2014, this increase in the abundance of P. arcuatum was not repeated, which might be connected to higher competition due to observed interannual changes in phytoplankton population structure.",

Concentration of BPA in sediment ranged from 5.32 μg kg -1 to 15.52 μg kg -1 , while in suspended matter BPA ranged from 4.66 μg kg -1 to 103.06 μg kg -1 . Seasonality in distribution of BPA concentrations in sediment and suspended matter was not found. The most abundant grain size fractions in sediment were silt (64.40±8.63%) and sand (26.97±9.11%) with accordingly determined sediment type as sandy silt. Average content of OM was 12.01±1.85% and 12.51±1.30%, for sediment and suspended matter, respectively. Monthly distribution of OM content showed higher values during October-March period and lower values during April-September period, while for the suspended matter situation was opposite.

Stomach contents of 1334 specimens, 8.1-23.1 cm total length, were analyzed. Of the total, 1166 were empty (87.4%). This percentage varied over the year, with a maximum during the spawning period (May-July) and minimum in February and August. Crustaceans and mollusks constituted the main prey in both the small and large size classes. As fish grew, the proportion of isopods in the stomachs decreased and the proportion of shrimps and benthic organisms increased. Diet composition varied seasonally, with crustaceans the most important prey item in all seasons especially summer and autumn. Higher feeding activity in winter may be related to the reproductive cycle of the wrasse and the abundance ofbenthic organisms. Results indicate that the peacock wrasse feeds on a wide range of prey items and is an opportunistic predator.",

Stomach contents of 203 specimens (11.5 - 32.9 cm TL) collected by bottom trawling were analyzed. Commonly accepted procedures were followed during the diet composition inspection and standard keys were used for food items determination. Examinations showed that 39 identified prey taxa belong to 11 major systematic groups: Crustacea, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Pisces, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Polychaeta, Nematoda, Bryozoa, Algae and Rhizaria. The predominant and preferred prey category was decapod crustaceans within all size categories and only in the largest individuals, the dominance of Bivalvia followed by Polychaeta and Crustacea were found. The largest individuals also showed more variety in consumption of different prey categories and a higher mean number of prey items in comparison with smaller fish. No significant differences in prey foraging between males and females \\((p&amp;gt;0.05)\\) and regarding to season \\((p&amp;gt;0.05)\\) were found. Feeding on such wide spectra of prey without significant variations regarding to sex and season suggests that the striped red mullets are able to adapt to shifts in spatio-temporal variations in the abundance of potential prey. Presence of detritus in the digestive tracts is highly related to its foraging behaviour on muddy detritic bottoms.",

All specimens used in this study, ranging from 7.2 to 70.4 cm in fork length and from 20 to 4889 g in total weight, were caught in the Aegean and Ionian Seas during the period 1997-2010. Otolith morphometry was studied using image analysis techniques for all intact sagittae ranging in weight from 0.6 to 11.3 mg and four shape indices were calculated. No statistical significant differences between left and right otolith morphometric variables were found. The age of fish was estimated by counting the pairs of opaque and translucent bands in transversal thin sections of otoliths. The estimated ages ranged from 0+ to 7 years and the von Bertalanffy growth parameters were determined \\((L∞=79.9 cm, k=0.261 and to=-1.230 years)\\). The examination of the type of growth bands at the outside margin of each otolith per month showed that one translucent band is formed annually during the cold season. The results revealed statistically significant relationships between otolith morphometric variables and fish length or age. Among the variables, otolith weight was the one that showed the highest correlation with age (R=0.77). Therefore, otolith weight could represent a valuable criterion for age estimation in Atlantic bonito that is objective, economic and easy to perform compared to annuli counting method in hard parts.",

In all provinces, a total number of 874 shore-based recreational fishers were interviewed via on-site face-to-face interviews during the fishing activity or at access points being monthly from January to December in 2015. Market value with RF index of added value approaches were used to calculate economic gains and losses from RF. The consistency was observed with the high education levels, high expense and high market value for fishers in the Middle Black Sea provinces; Kastamonu, Samsun, Sinop and Ordu. In all provinces, the harvesting costs stayed far below the average market prices of target species. Also, positive values of RF index were observed in all provinces. The species catch composition in Western and Eastern provinces did not show great differences. Furthermore, even if the habitat type along the Black Sea coast of Turkey did not show great variations, in the Western provinces some certain species including T. trachurus, S. sarda, B. belone, P. saltatrix, M. cephalus were caught in higher amounts. To summarize, RF along the Black Sea coasts of Turkey is an industry creating high economic returns by expenditures, jobs, catch value and further increased indirect economic impact in services sector.",

At most stations we observed a thermocline at approximately 20 m and a prominent chlorophyll a peak at about 70 m depth. The integrated phytoplankton and bacterial biomass were lower at the station in the central part of the southern Adriatic, and increased gradually towards middle Adriatic and towards coastal stations. Vertical profiles of both bacterial abundance and production showed a distinct peak in the surface layer. Bacterial abundance was high also in the layer of the deep chlorophyll a maximum. Higher bacterial production was associated with elevated abundance of pico- and nanoplankton feeding zooplankton indicating that bacterial populations were generally controlled by predation.",

Further, we describe Sargassum tissue, which is divided into an epidermis, cortex (primary and secondary), and central (axial) tissue. Systematically, we provide data on the composition, shape, and dimension of reproductive recesses (conceptacles) of reproductive organs (oogonia and antheridia). Ecologically, we discuss the vertical and horizontal distribution, variations, and adaptations to ecological factors (temperature, light, sea movements, salinity) of the eastern Adriatic Sargassum species. Three species of Sargassum are found in the eastern Adriatic. The species S. vulgare C. Ag. is represented by the typical form S. vulgare C. Ag. var. vulgare, the variation S. vulgare C.

The present study deals with the vertical distribution and abundance for each species at two localities of the Istrian peninsula coast (North Adriatic Sea). For this purpose chthamalid populations were monitored in 2015 along the Slovenian marine coast (Bay of Koper, Gulf of Trieste) and along the Croatian marine coast, near Rovinj (west Istrian coast), both on limestone. The main aim of the study was to establish if there was a relationship between the vertical distribution and abundance of these two species at different spatial scales: small (between sites, about 1 kilometer) and large (between localities, 10s of kilometers). The selected localities are slightly different in tidal range, in orientation and wave exposure. Three sites were randomly selected at each locality and two transects per tidal level (upper, middle and lower) were chosen on each site. The abundance of each chthamalids species in 1 dm2 plots was determined at three different tidal levels along each transect. The results indicated that the vertical distribution of C. montagui and C. stellatus was very similar between localities and even among sites, but their abundance varied. At both localities, C. montagui was more abundant in the upper and middle tidal levels, while C. stellatus was more abundant at the lower tidal level. It was also found that C. montagui was more abundant in sheltered conditions (Bay of Koper), while C. stellatus on the coast more exposed to the wave action (near Rovinj), at all tidal levels.",

The reasons for differences in blooming taxa were investigated by processing environmental variables of the most abundant taxa by Canonical Correspondence Analysis. The environmental parameters that most affected the species spatial distribution were salinity and temperature in June 1993 and salinity and water transparency in June 1998.

Surface flux data were available for only the northern Adriatic and the Po River represented all river runoff. The surface flux explains 68% of the variance in sea level while changes in local meteorological parameters explained 53%. Most of the variance was induced by changes in air pressure (32%) and heat flux (28%), while other factors did not contribute much. By determining annual (Sa) and semi-annual (Ssa) cycles, the explained variance increased to 88% for Sa tide and 95% for Ssa tide; changes were caused mostly by changes in air pressure (about 50% of the variance). Changes in the Sa heat flux cycle did not affect changes in the Sa tide but did affect Ssa tide (about 26% of the variance), presumably due to nonlinear effects driven by winds.",

A preliminary investigation on the use of artificial substrates to favour its spawning was carried out in a coastal area off the Abruzzi region, central Italy. Between May and June 2015, five groups of six pyramid structures made of a steel frame covered by plastic net, with a \\(0.5 m^2\\) surface available for deposition, were placed on sandy bottoms at about 0.5 nautical miles from the coast and at sea depths ranging from 5.5 m to 7.5 m. A density of T. mutabilis egg capsules \\(&amp;gt; 1 per 100 cm^2\\) was observed in two of the pyramid groups. The number of embryos present in each capsule ranged from 8 to 22 (mean number: 14). At the end of the study, almost all the capsules presented an apical opening and were empty, thus indicating successful hatching and larval release. This preliminary investigation shows that the natural deposition of T. mutabilis egg capsules can be facilitated by placing artificial substrates on sandy bottoms and it is conceivable that their use would contribute to maintain sustainable stocks of this species.",

Marine areas selected for this study are a protected area, a mariculture area, a shipyard and an industrial area. Based on the toxicity of the organic seawater extracts these areas were classified as an undisturbed reference area (S1), an area with the low anthropogenic impact (S2), a potentially endangered area (S3) and an area with high anthropogenic impact (S4) respectively. The organic mixtures present in seawater samples collected at the above defined areas were tested for the induction of DNA damage and cell cycle alterations in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis hemocytes. Flow cytometric analyses were performed to detect changes in hemocytes DNA content distribution throughout the cell cycle. Organic seawater extracts from sampling sites S2, S3 and S4 induced an increase in the coefficient of variation of the G0/G1 peak and an increase in the number of cells in the G2/M phase reflecting the extent of DNA damage and G2/M arrest, respectively. The G2/M arrest in mussel hemocytes was concentration-dependent upon injection with organic seawater extracts from the S3 site and time dependant for S2, S3 and S4 sampling sites. The time dependence of the induction of the G/M arrest showed a characteristic pattern for each site due to the different quantitative and qualitative composition of the organic seawater extracts. The G2/M arrest was reversible 24 or 72 hours after treatment with organic seawater extracts from S2 or S3, and S4 sites, respectively. This reversibility was time- and site-specific indicating that such DNA damage is repairable to a certain degree according to the organic seawater extract composition. Thus, the hemocytes cell cycle alterations in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis caused by organic seawater extracts reliably reflect the extent of organic contamination effects for selected marine areas.",

    "abstract": "Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus Houttuyn, 1782), is a coastal pelagic fish species that usually lives between the surface and depths of 250 or 300 m (BAuCHOt, 1987). It is a geographically widespread species that inhabits the moderate and warm waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans (COllEtE & NAuEN, 1983). It is also rather frequent in the Mediterranean and its adjacent seas (Black Sea, Adriatic Sea) (WHItEHEAd et al., 1986). together with other small and middle pelagic fish species, chub mackerel is an essential element of the marine ecosystem due to its biomass at intermediate levels of the food web, playing a relevant role in associating the lower and upper tropic levels (RICE, 1995; BAKuN, 1996; CuRy et al., 2000). Besides its importance in the food web, chub mackerel is also a commercially important fish The aim of the study was to present biometric analyses of chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus Houttuyn, 1782, from catch samples caught in the eastern Adriatic Sea between January 1998 and December 2008. Nine morphometric and eight meristic characters were analysed. The fork length (FL) of all observed specimens (N=4,157) ranged from 10.1 to 39.1 cm (mean ± SD: 23.8 ± 4.68 cm). All analysed length-length relationships were linear with high values of the coefficients of determination (r2>0.750). Males had significantly larger body depth than females as well as significantly larger number of soft rays in the pectoral fin; therefore, the possibility of sexual dimorphism was noted.",

    "abstract": "The morphological consequences of long-term exposure to low doses of 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in the ovaries were investigated in 50 adult female zebrafish at structural and ultrastructural levels. Animals were exposed to graded concentrations of 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (10, 40, 100 and 270 ppb) for 21 days, then zebrafish were sacrificed by an overdose of anaesthetic solution tricaine methanesulfonate, and immediately samples were taken for morphological evaluation. At lower concentrations of exposure there was no evidence of morphological modifications, while at higher concentrations (100 and 270 ppb) we frequently observed degeneration and inflammation. Significant increases in follicular atresia were observed among all groups (p<0.05). These results indicate that long-term exposure to low doses of 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin are able to induce morphological damage on the ovaries, which could then produce adverse effects on fish reproductive health.",

Some of these species are common and abundant fishes in the Adriatic Sea while some are rare with a very restricted distribution area. The species Trisopterus minutus is most widespread in the Adriatic, followed by Merlangius merlangus found in all shallower areas (particularly the northern Adriatic area), and Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis phycis, Phycis blennoides and Gaidropsarus mediterraneus mainly in the middle and southern Adriatic. Molva macrophthalma is however distributed only in the southern Adriatic. Of all the species in concerning, six show bathyphilous trend, distributed mainly in the area of continental slope or bathyal (bellow 200 m depth) and four species occur almost exclusively in the area of continental shelf that is down to 200 m. As to the substratum, most of the species prefer muddy bottoms rather than sandy and muddy – sandy bottoms.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the occurrence of seiches inside the Split harbor (Adriatic Sea). The measurements indicating the seiche periods were carried out with the pressure gauge placed near the harbor entrance. Spectral analysis of the data suggests a resonant behavior appearing in front of the harbor, that covers the periods between 7.7 and 28.5 min. The seiches were documented to occur at the periods of 6.5, 3.0, 1.6 and 1.15 min, and were verified by the barotropic 2D numerical model. In addition, two model runs were executed: the first one with the present topography and the second one with the nautical marina removed (built in 1972). The comparison should quantify the influence of the marina on the seiche characteristics. Namely, the leading seiche modes of 7.1-min and 5.0-min periods, calculated for the present topography, were probably joined in the 6.2-min mode before 1972. On the other hand, the numerical model showed that the 3.0-min seiche mode keeps its period, having the maximum amplitude at the north end of the harbor calculated for both runs. Finally, the seiches may endanger the navigation near the entrance and within the marina during the enhanced seiche episodes.",

There were clear physical effects on the seabed morphology, mostly as a consequence of the trawling passage. Strong and unequivocal signs of disturbance were not detected from the grain size analysis but there was a major spatial variability of sediment distribution. There were signs of stress in the macrobenthic community, i.e., reduction of complexity and diversity, increased variability of distributional patterns, and fewer large long-lived species in the fished area.",

In addition to detailed light microscopic analysis, ultrastructural analysis of benthic diatoms from Lake Mrtvo More was performed for the first time using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A total of 97 taxa were identified in 12 samples. Cocconeis scutellum Ehrenberg and Halamphora coffeiformis (C.Agardh) Levkov were the most frequent taxa in the samples. Shannon-Wiener diver-sity index (H’) values varied from 1.78 (in September on Padina sp.) to 4.52 (in August on glass). According to non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination, there were two groups: epilithon and artificial glass substrate as Group1 and macroalgae as Group2. The results of the analysis showed that the diatom communities developing on artificial sub-strates accurately correspond to the diatom community of a rock substrate and thus can be used as a representative alternative tool for studies of epilithic diatoms in further experiments.",

Based on otoliths relative sizes P. erythrinus and M. merluccius have Large otoliths, while M. barbatus has Small sagittal otoliths. The relationships between otolith variables and fish somatic growth were described by a linear function. All relationships were statistically highly significant (p&amp;lt;0.001). Otolith length (OL) was found to be the variable most strongly related to fish size, with 61.2 – 95.3 % of the variability, while otolith weight had the lowest coefficient of determination (r2). No differences were found neither between left and right otoliths, nor between male and female otoliths in these relationships. For all species studied the relationships of otolith length, height and weight against total fish length were all found to have positive allometry, indicating that the accretion of otoliths is relatively faster than increase in fish body size. The shape indices of form factor (FF), roundness (RD), aspect ratio (AR), circularity (C), rectangularity (R) and ellipticity (E) were calculated and the relationships between otolith length (OL) and shape indices were determined.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a review of the unusual occurrences of various marine species found upstream in the Neretva River and its wider delta zone in the last two decades. The occurrences of at least eight different marine species were reported by local fishermen, representing very rare records of these species in the upstream areas of rivers. Although some of these species generally inhabit both saltwater and brackish waters, their occurrences high upstream are probably the consequence of changes in hydrological conditions in Neretva River. Namely, more intense saltwater intrusion into the river observed in the last two decades provides suitable conditions for mass penetration of euryhaline organisms high into the Neretva River. In this biodiversity rich area which hosts a significant number of endemic species, such phenomena can threaten the local freshwater communities.",

The scheme used is SOFA (System for Ocean Analysis and Forecast, DE MEY & BENKIRAN, 2002) and this is the first coastal application of this scheme. The CTD data were collected in 4 coastal areas (Emilia – Romagna Coastal strip, the Gulf of Trieste, the Rovinj and Peljesac-Vis-Drvenik coastal strips) while temperature profiles were acquired with XBT in the southern Adriatic Sea deep ocean areas. The analysis skill scores are examined in order to evaluate the assimilation performance. The results of the assimilation are first compared with independent analyses of satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and it is found that assimilation of profiles improves the SST model estimate. Furthermore, the Root Mean Square (RMS) difference between model and temperature and salinity profiles before data insertion is analysed. The range of RMS temperature error is less than 1 0C for the entire area and decreases with time, indicating a positive impact of the assimilation. The RMS of salinity is less than 1 psu and it also shows a decreasing trend during the assimilation period.",

Samples were collected during the “Andrija Mohorovičić” oceanographic expedition (1974-1976) in all four seasons at 35 stations located along eight latitudinal transects in the northern, central and southern part of the Adriatic Sea. Fifteen ostracod species and two subspecies belonging to the family Halocyprididae were identified. The dominant species were Archiconchoecia striata , Porroecia spinirostris and Proceroecia macroprocera . Additionally , Paraconchoecia oblonga was recorded for the first time in the Adriatic Sea. The highest abundance and diversity of planktonic ostracods were found in the deep South Adriatic. Conversely, ostracods were scarce in the shallow North Adriatic area. As the transitional zone between these two regions, the Central Adriatic was characterized by high ostracod diversity, but a short period of dominance in the zooplankton assemblage. The horizontal distribution of planktonic ostracods in the Adriatic Sea could be linked to periodical ingressions of Eastern Mediterranean water masses and gyre currents, especially in the Central and the South Adriatic.",

The finding of the Mediterranean dealfish in the Strait of Sicily might be linked to its spawning period during which it approaches the shallow waters. The present specimen represents the first record in the Strait of Sicily.",

    "abstract": "Jellyfish are becoming an increasingly important component of studies of the global marine environment, as their frequent mass phenomena affect ecosystem performance and have economic and health consequences. Recent research has focused primarily on mass occurrences of scyphozoans and ctenophores, while less attention has been paid to hydromedusae blooms, which can also have significant impacts on the marine ecosystem with economic consequences. Like many members of the Scyphozoa and Ctenophora, Aequorea species can be numerous and form blooms. Based on surveys from 2000 to 2020 and information provided by marine professionals, we examine the (multiannual) variability, seasonality, and spatial distribution patterns of the poorly studied temperate species Aequorea cf. forskalea (Hydrozoa: Leptothecata). We hypothesized that this macrogelatinous jellyfish with a bipartite life cycle (benthic polyps and planktonic medusae) is sensitive to seasonal and long-term temperature fluctuations, particularly because temperature has been shown to play a critical role in mediating transitions in the life cycle of cnidarians. The cold-water affinity of A. cf. forskalea was confirmed by a significant negative correlation with temperature and the most frequent occurrence during the winter-spring period. For the northern Adriatic (Gulf of Trieste), sea temperature data and semi-quantitative plankton data are available for the first decade of the 20th century, allowing comparison of the historical data (1900-1911) with our current data set. Compared to historical records, the current occurrence of A. cf. forskalea differs significantly. With the warming of the northern Adriatic Sea since the beginning of the 20th century, the current phenology of A. cf. forskalea has changed, probably related to the delayed production of medusae by hydroids in autumn, the absence of medusae in this season and their less frequent occurrence in winter.",

The results showed spatial and temporal variations in quality. The worst bathing water quality was in the eastern part of the area, at beaches Torac, Kamp and Gojača. Levels of indicator microorganisms at identified sources of fecal pollution near these beaches indicate a significant load of fecal material to these areas. The observed decrease in annual fecal indicator bacteria exceedances, while not statistically significant, indicates a trend toward improvement in water quality. The number of sites with worse annual and final assessment showed a decreasing trend only since 2017 and 2020, respectively, which is not a ‘sufficient’ time period to draw a clear conclusion about the trend. The improvements are probably the result of intensive work in recent years to improve the sewage system in the area. In the annual and final assessment, bathing sites from Kaštela with ‘poor’ water quality accounted on average for more than 27% of all waters with ‘poor’ quality in Croatia. This implies that additional efforts are needed to eliminate the sources of fecal pollution in the area.",

Total PAH concentrations ranged from 14,98 to 26145,62 µg kg-1, with the highest levels determined in the sediments of Šibenik Bay and the lowest in the sediment near Island of Pag. Unsubstituted PAH were prevailing PAH group in the sediments from the Šibenik Bay and in the Coastal area, while methyl-substituted PAH were dominant group in the sediments of the Kaštela Bay. In order to estimate the possible toxicological significance of PAH concentrations, Sediment Quality Assessment was done according to three different sets of sediment quality guidelines. A high environmental risk was calculated for each station in Šibenik Bay; for the station in vicinity of the Industrial port of Split and for the two stations in Coastal zone. Low environmental risk was determined in less urbanised areas such as Island of Pag. Sediment extracts were further analysed for acute toxicity by measurements of decrease in bioluminescence upon exposure to sediment extracts. Obtained results show disagreement between sediment toxicity predicted upon PAH levels in sediment and experimentally obtained sediment toxicity. Sediment extracts in which low PAH levels were measured showed high acute toxicity indicating that concentrations of PAH alone are a poor indicator of sediment toxicity. Correlation analysis between concentrations of specific PAH compounds and toxicity revealed the strongest association between acute sediment toxicity and sulphur-containing PAH suggesting the S-PAH should be considered in sediment toxicity assessment.",

Indeed, the presence of this typically westernAtlantic shark in the Mediterranean Sea is supported by as few as two historical specimens that were captured at Nice (southeastern France) and Leghorn (northern Tyrrhenian coast of central Italy). Here, we provide a redescription and an updated taxonomic identification of the Leghorn specimen of smalleye hammerhead, which is currently kept in the zoological collection of the Natural History Museum of the University of Pisa and is believed by some authors to represent a misidentified representative of S. lewini. Based on first-hand observations, we confirm the taxonomic identification of this specimen as belonging to S. tudes. Considering the ontogenetically young nature of both the Nice and the Leghorn specimens of S. tudes, parturition in the Mediterranean Sea is hypothesised, which in turn may evoke the occurrence of a population of smalleye hammerheads inhabiting this basin at least as recently as the early 19th century.",

This heterogeneity was observed not only according to the origin (seawater, sediment, fish and bivalve aquaculture farms) but also within the same type of sample.

The populations of M. merlangus were found to be genetically diverse, with 14 haplotypes and 15 polymorphic regions. The overall haploid diversity was 0.910 ± 0.024, and the nucleotide diversity was 0.003± 0.0003. Genetic distances between populations varied between 0.13% and 8.02%, while genetic distances within M. merlangus populations varied between 0.09% and 0.42%. Principle Coordinates Analysis showed that Marmara, Black Sea, and Karadeniz Ereğli populations were clearly separated. Pairwise FST values varied from 0.12 to 0.69, highlighting high genetic variation among populations. The Black Sea and Marmara lineages of M. merlangus diverged from the North Sea lineage 1.65 (1.08-2.29) mya, whereas the separation between the Atlantic lineage occurred about 0.84 (0.51-1.2) mya. The recent expansion of the whiting population was identified through neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analyses.

As a first phase in the development of the system, an automatic station (AMOS) was placed at the Marjan Cape, Split. It enables acquisition, validation and archiving of data for eleven meteorological and oceanographic parameters in real time, as well as calculation of some derived parameters and their dissemination in graphic forms over Internet (http://www.izor.hr/eng/online). Most of the measured data have been compared with data obtained from the permanent meteorological station located at the top of the Marjan hill, which is three kilometres away. Also, data from the AMOS station have been used by two high-resolution numerical models with the aim of achieving time-dependent spatial fields of oceanographic parameters in the Kastela Bay. The AMOS station was a part of the Integrated coastal zone management system in the Adriatic Sea (ADRICOSM) project, where the AMOS data were very useful for various analyses in the Peljesac-Vis-Drvenik area. Data analyses and numerical models results will be used for further improvements in the automatic monitoring system.",

    "abstract": "Three types of multi-mesh benthic survey gillnets were tested for their performance in the uniform muddy bottom habitat of the Bay of Piran. We describe the compared methods, present their positive and negative aspects and suggest a sampling design that could be used with different research goals. The research sampling was performed in winter in the years from 2010 to 2012. The sampling site is situated close to a sea bass rearing fish farm in the Northern Adriatic Sea. With the Nordic 1.5 type nets 5 species were detected compared to the 23 and 20 species detected with the Adriatic 2.5 and 5.0 nets. In the Nordic 1.5 type nets only demersal species were caught and even for those a much greater sampling effort would be required to reach a representative sample. On the other hand, both the Adriatic type nets also caught benthopelagic and pelagic species, and a correlation between net height and size of fish in these two nets was detected. While both the Adriatic type nets proved successful in achieving a representative sample of fish assemblage, the Adriatic 2.5 nets performed better in terms of CPUE and as such also reached a better cost-benefit ratio.

Investigation topics included the temporal distribution and abundances of nauplii, copepodites and adult specimens, as well as the density of their faecal pellets. It would appear that only C. ponticus is adapted to the extreme conditions of the lake, low winter and high summer temperatures, as well as long period of hypersaline conditions. During the summer-autumn period, the abundances of nauplii, copepodites and adult specimens reach extreme values. Lake Mir is ecologically very interesting and generally among very rare habitats.

Results obtained showed that meshes smaller than 20 mm (13.5 mm, 16.1 mm, 17.5 mm) catch large numbers of immature individuals, since the length of 50% retention (L50%) for all these meshes is smaller than the length of fish at first spawning and which is, for Pagellus erythrinus in Montenegrin waters, approximate to 12 cm.

Samples were taken each month. Total length of individuals ranged from 6.6 to 12.2 cm, while weight ranged from 1.58 to 11.27 g, Their ovaries were extracted and weighed, and a piece of female gonad tissue was sampled for histological analysis.

The lowest GSI values were found in November and remained at low levels until April, which corresponded to the gonad rest stage. The GSI increased gradually during April and May, which coincides with the begining of spawning period. Although primary oocytes (stage I) were present during all months, their percentage increased from October and was the highest during the winter months (November-March 100%). Mature cells, stage IV, were present during April – October period, with highest value in May when they comprised 12.3% of total oocyte number. An increase in the percentage of oocytes in the yolk vesicle (II) and yolk (III) stages occurred in April, remaining almost unchanged until October.

Although they were present all year round, their monthly pattern of appearance indicated that less tunas were recorded in May-June, more dolphins were noted from July to October while swordfish were mostly abundant in winter (January-March). Within the investigated period, slightly increasing trend of tuna and dolphins’ appearance was recorded, although statistically not significant. Analysing possible correlation between purse seine catches and predator’s abundances, revealed that appearance of tuna had negative impact on the catches (dispersion of schools), while realised catches in presence of dolphins were quite good so it seems that they tend to round up small pelagic fish schools.",

    "abstract": "Capture-based tuna aquaculture rates as one of the most important aquaculture activities in Cro-atia, where juvenile tuna are reared in cages for over a year long period in order to increase substan-tially their weight. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of length and intensity of feeding on biochemical composition (total fat, moisture, dry matter, carbohydrates and protein content) of tuna (Thunnus thynnus) white muscle tissues in newly caught tuna prior to feeding (NCTPF) versus far-med tuna kept in rearing circular cages in the Vela Grska Bay, Adriatic Sea (LAT 43°17’40,6984”N, LONG 016°28’58,4315”E (WGS84)) between 2001 and 2004. Farmed tunas from all cages were fed with the feed consisting of domestic small pelagic fish, or with mixtures containing North Sea herring (Clupea harengus) and Sardina pilchardus, for five months (cage 3), eight months (cage 4) or 21 months (cages 1 and 2). A low content of moisture and high content of dry matter including fat was observed in farmed tuna muscles compared to wild-caught tuna. In farmed tuna muscles, measured moisture was 55.26% in cage 1, 39.95% in cage 2, 54.64% in cage 3 and 49.70% in cage 4. These results are significantly lower than moisture measured in NCTPF (80.36%). Content of dry matter found in farmed tuna muscles also differed greatly between wild tuna (19.64%) and far-med tuna, but also between the cages (44.74% in cage 1, 60.05% in cage 2, 45.36% in cage 3 and 50.30% in cage 4). In NCTPF, muscle tissues total fat encompassed less than 1% of the total body weight, while it reached over 20% of total body mass in farmed fed tuna (20.62% in cage 1, 42.50% in cage 2, 20.97% in cage 3 and 20.57% in cage 4). These results demonstrate that high fat content can be achieved already after five months of intensive feeding. Higher content of proteins was also found in aquacultured tuna (18.60% in cage 1, 16.00% in cage 2, 15.09% in cage 3 and 20.58% in cage 4) compared to wild-caught tuna (13.77%). There were no differences in carbohydrates con-tent between tuna farmed in different cages and NCTPF tuna, indicating glycogen as a less optimal indicator of muscle tissue quality in farmed tuna of the present study.",

    "abstract": "The seasonal and spatial distributions of particulate phosphorus (PP) in the water column of the coastal area and open sea of the middle Adriatic Sea area were investigated for the first time. The relationship between PP and two other important forms of phosphorus (dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), and organic phosphorus (P-ORG)), and the relationship between PP and other nutrients (nitrogen and silicon salts) and oceanographic parameters (temperature, salinity, oxygen saturation, chlorophyll a) from the water column were also examined. PP concentrations ranged from 0.007 μmol dm-3 in the open sea near Palagruža archipelago to 0.589 μmol dm-3 in the Krka River estuary. In the coastal area, PP concentrations were highest in autumn and lowest in winter. The vertical distribution of PP concentrations in the water column of the coastal area were highest in the surface layer during most of the year due to input of PP by freshwater inflows. In the open sea area, there were no significant seasonal or vertical differences in the distribution of PP concentrations in thewater column. Seasonal analysis of the total phosphorus pool (PP, DIP and P-ORG) in the water column indicated that PP and P-ORG concentrations were higher in the coastal area compared to the open sea, while DIP concentrations were comparable.The results further demonstrate that PP can be an important fraction of the total phosphorus pool. A significant positive correlation was found between PP and chlorophyll a, indicating that PP was mainly of biological origin, and with nutrient salts of nitrogen and silicon, while a negative correlation was found with salinity.",

    "abstract": ": The yelkouan shearwater Puffinus yelkouan is endemic to the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and classified as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List. Information on the species’ distribution and habitat use in the eastern Mediterranean is scant, and only a few studies were based on direct visual observations in offshore waters. Here, we provide information on 1) the occurrence of yelkouan shearwaters within a 3000 km2 study area off the region of Veneto, Italy, in the northwestern Adriatic Sea, based on visual surveys conducted from small boats between April and October 2018–2022 (effort: 169 days, 23,836 km), and 2) the geographic, bathymetric and oceanographic variables likely to drive the species’ offshore distribution. Yelkouan shearwaters (238 sightings, 916 individuals) were observed in waters 9–33 m deep, between 2 and 24 km from the coast. Individual counts ranged between 1 and 100, with 95% of the encounters having less than 10 individuals. An Explainable Boosting Machine model – a machine learning technique based on generalized additive models – selected chlorophyll a as the most important variable to explain the species’ occurrence, followed by distance from the coast, and bottom depth. The model indicated a higher occurrence in waters with chlorophyll a less than ~2.3 mg/m3 , farther than ~15 km from the coast, and deeper than ~22 m. The effects of SST, salinity, and day of the year were less clear. This study provides insight into the offshore distribution of yelkouan shearwaters, within one of the Mediterranean areas most exposed to cumulative human threats",

    "abstract": "In an attempt to contribute to the understanding of the biodiversity of Digenea in Algeria, we analysed for the first time the community structure of the digenean fauna of Oblada melanurus (Linnaeus, 1758). From June 2022 to July 2023, 172 specimens of O. melanurus were sampled from various locations off the Algerian waters and their digestive tracts were examined to collect the digenean parasites. We analysed the community structure by calculating the parasitological parameters. Also, a species accumulation curve (SAC) was generated to evaluate the sampling effort, and the Chi-square test was performed to evaluate the effects of seasonal variation on the prevalence of parasites. We collected 434 Digenea, which belonged to three species: Lepocreadium album (Stossich, 1890) Stossich, 1904 (Lepocreadiidae Odhner, 1905); Mag-nibursatus bartolii Kostadinova, Power, Fernandez, Balbuena, Raga &amp;amp; Gibson, 2003 (Derogenidae Nicoll, 1910) and Macvi-caria dubia (Stossich, 1905) Bartoli, Bray &amp;amp; Gibson, 1989 (Opecoelidae Ozaki, 1925). Our findings include a new geographical record for M. dubia and the first report of L. album and M. bartolii from this particular host in Algeria. L. album had the high-est prevalence and mean abundance values, while M. dubia had the highest mean intensity. According to the Chi-square test, significant differences in prevalence between seasons were observed only for L. album and M. bartolii. We offered the first insights into the Digenea fauna parasitizing O. melanurus in Algeria, enriching the knowledge of digenean biodiversity in Algerian marine fish. Additionally, we shed light on the seasonal variations in the prevalence of these digeneans. This study may serve as a valuable reference for future research on Digenea in other marine species and regions.",

Specimens were found at depths ranging from 1 to 4 meters, cohabiting with the Mytilus galloprovincialis on artificial hard substrates. Numerous individuals ranging in size from 1 cm to 4 cm were observed. The introduction of P. magna into Moroccan waters is likely due to biofouling on aquaculture facilities and vessels, which is consistent with its spread in other Mediterranean areas.

    "abstract": "Lake Zmajevo Oko (ZO), a marine lake near Rogoznica, Croatia, known for sudden anoxic overturns and progressive deoxygenation, has been studied extensively for its physical and biogeochemical properties over the past 30 years. However, the water exchange with the sea through the porous karst remains poorly understood. From 2020 to 2023, opportunistic temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and sea level measurements were conducted at various sites in and around ZO, including underwater caves, which are believed to facilitate the greatest exchange with the sea. Although tides in ZO are attenuated compared to the sea, tidal exchange influences the upper-layer lateral boundary temperatures. Moreover, the water that enters ZO has different effects in winter and summer and may alter hydrostatic stability depending on its salinity. Spectral analyses of water levels show that the karst between ZO and the sea acts as a natural filter, protecting against high-frequency water level fluctuations in the neighbouring sea. Fluctuations in dissolved oxygen and nutrients were also observed during the tidal cycle at locations with considerable subsurface exchange. However, more precise sampling strategies are needed to quantify the effects of ZO-sea exchange on ZO’s biogeochemical properties. As anoxic overturn events become more frequent, further studies are essential to understand ZO’s sensitivity to water exchange, particularly in the context of a changing climate that is expected to bring higher air temperatures, increased salinity, and more extreme precipitation in the Adriatic.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of seasonal and depth distribution of epiphytic flora and vegetation on Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile leaves. The investigations were carried out seasonally, in 1984 at 5, 15 and 25m depth in one Posidonia bed on the west coast of Hvar Island (middle Adriatic). A total of 103 epiphytic algal taxa were determined (Rhodophyta 72 taxa, Phaeophyta 16 taxa and Chlorophyta 15 taxa). The highest number of taxa was observed during winter (75 taxa) and at 5m depth (78 taxa), and the lowest during autumn (63 taxa) and at 15m depth (73 taxa). The SO ; RRENSEN’ ; s coefficient of similarity, R/P quotient and Cluster Analysis were calulated for similarity epiphytic floras of different Mediterranean and Adriatic areas. In epiphytic vegetation the mean total covering of sample (Rt%) decreased along the depth gradient (21.56% at 5m and 11.03% at 25m). Within qualitative dominance (DN%) predominated the filamentous algal taxa of Phsl and Ssl ecological supergroups, and D ecological group. Regarding quantitative dominance (DR%), in this vegetation dominated the calcareous, filamentous and foliose algal taxa of Phsl and Ssl ecological supergroups, and HP and D ecological groups. The Cluster Analysis show that a high significant (about 87%) of epiphytic vegetations exist between the investigated vegetation (present paper) and group of areas which are formed of Sicily, Dubrovnik, Ischia and French coast. Within the structure of epiphytic vegetation it is possible to separate the algal taxa for which the high values of RMi%  ; 0.50% along with high values of P (3, 4 or 5) were recorded, that the most significantly participated in structure of this vegetation.

The presently applied method facilitates deeper visual census studies below 40 m, where they have rarely been done before due to the increasing research challenges with depth. The video on underwater scooter method is also expected to be less disturbing and faster compared to swimming divers. The method was applied in visual census study of fish assemblages from 8 to 50 m depth conducted at two locations in the east Adriatic using 102 video transects. The environmental variables contributing to the variation of the reef fish community in the depth range of the infralittoral and upper circalittoral bottoms were also recorded. Thirty-one fish species were recorded on transects and 10.3% of all individuals were not identified to the species level. The average density on transects was 0.8 individuals/m², with C. chromis, C. julis and G. auratus being both the most abundant and the most frequent species. Three environmental variables, depth, bottom with zoocover and eastern orientation of the coast, were identified as highly significant for species occurrence. Abundance and species richness of fish assemblages showed no significant variation with depths, inclinations, orientations and sites. A significant difference in the fish assemblage structure was found among orientations, depths and inclinations with the gradient change of species composition with increasing depth and with increasing inclination.",

The analisys of growth patterns in vertebrae of Z. cristatus allowed to estimate an age of 4 years for this individual. We also combined our data together with information from bibliographic sources and estimated the relationships between total length and standard length, as well as total length and body mass, for these two species.",

In this study we document the first numerous and permanent occurrence of N. lucullana in the estuary of the Neretva River, an unusual habitat for this typical marine species. We provide COI barcode sequence of this species, which is also first genetic sequence ever published of N. lucullana. Weekly data on the occurrence and abundance of N. lucullana were obtained from reports and records of autonomous divers and local fishermen in the area from Opuzen to Metković from mid-June to the end of October 2021. The individuals were always located in the layer above the bottom with salinity between 35.2 and 38.2. The diameters of the jellyfish bells ranged from 15 mm to 72 mm, most of them between 40 mm and 58 mm. Differential development of the gonads was observed in all specimens larger than 25 mm. In mid-June, the specimens were common but solitary. A week later, the jellyfish were more frequent and in smaller aggregations. From late June to mid-September, the jellyfish were constantly observed in larger aggregations. Toward the autumn, the number of individuals gradually decreased, and by the last week of October, only single individuals were observed. Our results indicate significant changes in the ecosystem of the Neretva estuary and confirm the observed composition of zooplankton communities dominated by marine species in summer and autumn.",

Three types of experimental collector made from vegetable sacks, modelled based on the collectors used in Japan, were placed in four existing fish and shellfish farms located in the Boka Kotorska Bay. The experimental collectors were placed in the periods June–October and June–December 2017 and the period August 2017–February 2018 and monitored after immersion of four to six months, respectively. In total, 18 species of molluscs and also 28 species of biofouling organisms were determined. The most abundant ones found on the collectors were the following shellfish species (68 %) Talohlamys multistriata, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Modiolarca sp., Anomia ephippium and Limaria hians. The most abundant group of biofouling organisms were crustaceans (18 percent) with a species of porcelain crab, Pisidia longicornis, and tunicates (5 percent) with the species Phallusia mammillataand Ascidia mentula. The main target species, Great Mediterranean scallop, was most abundant on collector Type II,with 28 individuals. From three types of experimental collectors used in the process of collecting larvae of shellfish and biofouling species, collector type-I and type-II proved to be a more suitable basis for receiving larvae of shellfish due to the unimpeded flow of sea water that allows their successful growth and development. Species Talochlamys multistriata, were found in great abundance and it could be good candidate to diversify the aquaculture production, thus potentially offering farmers an additional source of income.",

Sampling was performed by means of a scientific bottom trawl hauled at a depth range of 121-126 m on 21 February 2024. Available data show that S. blainville may be captured in demersal fishery within their first year of life. Total length (TL) and total weight (TW) of the examined males ranged from 169 to 279 mm (238.4±20.7 mm) and from 21.4 to 117 g (66.5±19.8 g), respectively. The TL and TW of the examined females ranged from 187 to 292 mm (241.1±25.3 mm) and from 30.1 to 146 g (66.8±29.2 g), respectively. A male neonate (TL=169 mm) examined is believed to be the smallest free-swimming longnose spurdog caught to date. Under current fisheries regulations, S. blainville is a protected shark species in the waters of Türkiye and therefore should be released if caught as bycatch. However, in addition to reducing fishing pressure on the species by prohibiting targeted fishing, area-based conservation actions, which are based on closing areas that are critical for chondrichthyans (e.g., nurseries) to fishing either on a year-round or seasonal basis, should now be included in the conservation plans for S. blainville and other protected species in Turkish waters.",

A total of six specimens of this rare species were caught, with bottom trawl and pelagic trawl nets, in the scope of the Deep Sea Research of the bathyal fauna in the South Adriatic Pit in 2008 and 2010. Specimens were caught at depths down to 1200 m, therefore making it the deepest and northernmost finding of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. The dorsal mantle lengths of analyzed specimens ranged between 21 and 60 mm. Only in females, a visceral photophore on the ventral side of the inc sac was detected. Some new information on morphometric body and beak features was given in the paper, including the description of beak pigmentation. A number of increments in statoliths revealed that individuals were between three and five months old. A positive linear correlation between the length of statoliths and number of increments/age in days was detected. Macroscopic and histological samples of gonads proved that one specimen was sexually mature (August), four specimens were in stages of sexual maturation (May and August) and two were immature (March). The results indicated that the maturation process of the species in the South Adriatic Sea starts in spring and the full sexual maturity is reached during summer.

    "abstract": "Rotifer Brachionus plicatilis is commonly used organism as larval live food in marine finfish rearing. It has been shown that the prey size is function of larva's mouth size (Arthur, 1976 ; Beyer, 1980), and as it grows, it selects prey to meet its mouth opening (Hunter, 1980). We examined sinergetic effect of temperature and salinity on lorica size of mass cultured rotifers. For the experiment rotifers were inoculated in three tanks with 400 l of medium, with ceramic heaters and custom made aeration system (Skaramuca, 1994). Rotifers were fed microalga Nannochloropsis sp. with cell density at 4x106cellsml-1ą1x106cellsml-1. We reared rotifers at nine combinations of 38, 27 and 20psu and 35, 27 and 22°C for five days to allow the rotifers to acclimatizate to conditions, and during the day 6 to day 10 we performed daily measurements of lorica length and width on 50 animals per set of conditions. The numbers were subjected to ANOVA statistical analysis (P<0.05). ANOVA (F=46.757, P<0.001) showed significant difference between rotifers reared at different salinities and temperatures. The loricas of rotifers reared at 38psu and 27°C had the lowest average value, with 89.50% of individuals smaller than 150mm. That differed significantly from any other combination (<0.001). The highest average lorica lengths were noted at 20psu and 22°C, with 53.87% of individuals in range 150-250mm. As a rule, the highest percentages(<50%) of rotifers smaller than 150mm were found in tanks with 38psu. The highest number (58.43%) of rotifers in range of 150-250mm were found on 27psu, 22°C. Fukusho and Iwamoto (1980) contribute this phenomena to seasonal cyclomorphosis, while Hirano (1987) is of opinion that difference in size is due to the higher reproduction rate of rotifers at higher temperatures. Genetical makeup and other factors, such as metabolism and adaptive physiology are also stated as causes of differences in size. While we have been dealing with S-type of Brachionus plicatilis, we yielded signifficantly different rotifers, which implies that optimal combination of temperature and salinity are required in rearing rotifers of specific size.",

    "abstract": "The grapsoid Brachynotus sexdentatus (Risso, 1827) is a small sized Mediterranean crab, whose ecology is poorly known despite frequently cited in the scientific literature. High densities occasionally recorded in estuarine habitats suggest this opportunistic species might play a functional role in connecting benthic primary production with consumption at higher trophic levels. The brackish Lake Ganzirri (north-eastern Sicily) hosts a population of this varunid crab, whose differential distribution of juveniles and adults, respectively found on hard and soft substrates, involves different habitat preferences and consequent resource partitioning. Investigation on daily and seasonal dynamics of the soft-bottom dwelling adults showed a male biased population, with size-related differences between sex, station, season and female reproductive phase. Our data, suggesting an annual life span, prolonged spawning and related continuous recruitment, are in agreement with the intrinsic unpredictability of the colonized brackish environment. At last, preliminary in aquaria observations on the characteristic male cheliped vesicles, showed they might involved in agonistic and courtship behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The knowledge of morphological relationships and particularly of those concerning fish body girth (G) with total length (TL) is necessary in gear selectivity and specifically the technical measures to avoid capture of undersized individuals. This study concerns 24 marine species exploited by the small-scale coastal fleet in the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean Sea), for 6 of which, the TL-G relationships are mentioned for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea and the adjacent seas. Samples were collected seasonally, from April 2016 to February 2017. The coefficients of the linear regression of body girth in three body positions, (Geye, posterior to the eye; Ghead at the posterior end of the operculum; Gmax at the maximum body depth), with the total length were estimated for each species and for the groups formatted when Geye, Ghead and Gmax were plotted against total length for all the species combined. Statistically significant differences among the three groups were detected (ANCOVA, P&amp;lt;0.001). Comparison of the total length-body girth relationships for 18 species previously studied in different geographic areas of the Mediterranean and the adjacent seas, showed differences mainly with the results from Portuguese waters for certain species populations. Based on the resulted equations, the maximum girth (G max) corresponding to the Minimum Conservation Reference Size (MCRS) and to the total length at maturity (L m) were calculated for each species. Identified mesh sizes respective to G max values were quite larger than the minimum legal mesh size for gillnets and the inner sheet of trammel nets, indicating that the relevant current fisheries regulations cannot meet the requirements for sustainable exploitation of fish resources.",

    "abstract": "the adriatic Sea, as part of the Mediterranean Sea, shares with that region all common characteristics in terms of geographical features, available marine resources, their type and intensity of exploitation. Moreover, those fisheries functioned in very specific socio-economical and historical contexts. all Mediterranean coastal areas have a high diversity of littoral benthic communities at a very small spatial scale which implies high biodiversity and trophic complexity (Staglicic et al., 2011, under review). Since ancient times fishing has played a role in shaping the Mediterranean food webs, Artisanal fisheries in Croatia and throughout the Mediterranean coastal region have a long tradition. In recent times the booming growth of human populations along Mediterranean coasts has led to harvesting of its marine resources in almost insupportable quantities, thus placing the research of this topic in a complex context. At the same time, fisheries management throughout the Mediterranean region has remained conventional in its nature, implying that it is almost only based on gear specific management provisions. The current Croatian legislative framework and legislative changes of artisanal fisheries regulation in the last 15 years, as well as how these changes have impacted on the state of coastal fish resources, particularly target species condition, are discussed. The conclusion is that if we want to improve further the state of the resources a more comprehensive set of management measures incorporating closed areas and a new approach actively involving fishers in the management process should be adopted. Finally, guidelines for future management in terms of the monitoring and data collection framework (DCF) proposed by the EU are demonstrated.",

Five hundred and eighteen bottom trawl hauls were performed at 56 predetermined permanent stations along ten transects, over different sediment types at depths of 10 to 430 m. Astropecten irregularis was recorded in 82.2% of the hauls, with the highest biomass and abundance indices at depths from 10 to 50 m. The deepest record was in a haul from 313.5 to 412.5 m depth. Even though it was recorded all over the investigated area, it was most abundant in some areas of the northernmost part of the Adriatic, and very abundant in the areas along the western coast. The highest average biomass and abundance indices were recorded on sand-silt-clay sediment, on silty sand and sandy silt and on the clayey silt and silty clay.",

Sa amplitudes are on average 20 % higher in the north than in the South Adriatic, while Ssa amplitudes are the same in the entire Adriatic. The Sa phase is between 180o and 230o, but the opposite phase is noticed in 1986 and 1988. The generating forces of the tides include steric effect, atmospheric pressure and evaporation minus precipitation ; however interannual changes are primarily the result of air pressure changes. The Sa amplitude as the result of processes other than air pressure is 6.0 cm.",

    "abstract": "The eastern part of Bulgaria entirely borders the Black Sea, which defines it as a maritime country. The Bulgarian coast is an important fishing region for local people and has a high potential for interactions between fisheries and cetaceans. Depredation caused by cetaceans and damage to fishing gears can potentially lead to substantial economic loss for fishermen, while cetacean bycatch raises conservation concerns. Over the period 2016 - 2019, we conducted face-to-face interviews with fishermen in local fishing areas to better understand the fisheries – cetacean interactions in the Bulgarian part of the Black Sea. The research objectives were to identify the current fishermen’s attitudes toward cetaceans, understand the damage caused by local marine mammals to the different types of fishing gear, and gather fishermen’s proposals to resolve the problems. To record all of this, a specially designed structured survey was conducted. The results showed that fishermen’s attitude towards cetaceans was mostly positive and was not influenced by the type of fishing gear used. We found that fisheries - cetacean interactions are frequent, especially with dalyans gear and set gillnets. Cetacean bycatch mortality was reported to be highest for set gillnets, and the most vulnerable species was the Phocoena phocoena. Although interview data may be biased due to differences in perceptions and experience of the interviewees, and therefore should be interpreted with caution, this method allowed us to cover multiple types of interactions between cetaceans and Bulgarian fisheries.",

There were no statistically significant differences between the sexes in the morphometric and meristic characteristics of the blackspot seabream in the Adriatic Sea. Regarding meristic characteristics, there are no significant morphological differences between the blackspot seabream population in the Adriatic Sea and that in other areas of the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Relative growth was studied by comparing changes in morphological characteristics with growth in total length and head length.

Benthic flora consisted of 245 species and intraspecific taxa of multicelular algae (Rhodophyta 146 taxa, Phaeophyta 57 taxa, Chlorophyta 42 taxa) and 2 species of seagrasses. Regarding quality and quantity zoobenthic settlements are well developed and cover 299 macrozoobenthic species from nine sistematic groups. The distribution of these settlements at deeper mobile bottoms of the open part is characterized by high total and mean values, but showes considerable variations in relation to the mechanical structure of the sediment at certain parts of the studied area. Ichthyological (groundfish stock) settlements are well developed at mobile bottoms of the wider area of the IVANA and IKA fields which is well confirmed by the rather high total amounths of the quantity of the zoobenthos of 47 50 t, of which the edible part ( fish, crustaceans, shellfish and cephalopoda), total 6680 t and nonedible 41270 t. From the point of view of fisheries and economy the wider area of gas fields, due to the abundancy and variability of edible resources, represents a significant part of the open Adriatic fishing grounds.",

They were fed commercial crumbels and pellets alone (F1), or mixed with 35% chicken eggs (F2), or mixed with 35% blue mussel flesh (F3). The daily feeding rate, daily protein feeding rate, daily growth rate, feed efficency (FE), protein efficency ratio (PER), protein productive value (PPV) and specific growth rate (SGR) were calculated monthly after weighing. Fish fed diet F3 grew to 250 g significantly (P<0.05 ; ANOVA) faster than those fed F2 or F1, in 15.0 months rather than 16.6 months. The daily feeding rates significantly differed (P<0.05) between groups and was highest in group F3 (3.80p 0.18%) and lowest in group F1 (1.72p 0.34%). There were no significant differences in daily growth rate (P=0.58-0.11). The daily growth rate, FE, Per and PPV were negative in winter.

The most devastating infection for reared octopus stock was shown to be a coccidian parasite Aggregata sp. (Apicomplexa: Aggregatidae), causing weigh loss, excitations and changes in behavior and disseminated miliar subcutaneous parasite cysts. In the aquaculture facility of Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, during the experimental fattening of common octopus, 7% mortalities in course of 8 months were attributed to infection of Aggregata sp. Even Aggregatidae’ detailed life cycle is not elucidated completely, it is known that this heteroxenous coccidian uses crustaceans for the merogony, which comprise 30% of cephalopod’ rearing diet. For the moment, only adequate zooprofilactic measures can unable the emergence of the infection in rearing system. The avoidance of introduction of adult specimens in the rearing system would be the crucial zooprofilactic measure, along with the catch of only juvenile cephalopods that did not contract the coccidian through food web in natural environment, thus are not able to introduce the infection in the rearing system. The second measure would consist of avoidance of crustacean in the rearing diet.",

This species was mainly recorded in the Atlantic Ocean and recently extended its natural range toward the southern Mediterranean Sea. Biological and ecological traits were not available to date with special regard to its native and recipient habitat. S. venustissimum isopoda inhabits area below stones covered by biofouling and empty nests of barnacles. The species occursand reproduces in Tunis Southern Lagoon throughout the year with a peak in early spring and late summer. Males significantly outnumbered females during high reproductive activity period (May - July). The first gravid female was observed at 7 mm and the fecundity ranged between 6 and 17 eggs. Among the gravid females, a significant relationship was noted between the importance of brood versus total body length for all ovigerous female cohorts. The recruitment occurred throughout the year with a winter peak. S. venustissimum have established a sustainable population in Tunisia and have spread into the wild in its new host area.",

Market value approach was utilized to calculate net economic values and expenses of recreational fishers along in eight coastal districts, Göztepe, Karataş, Konak, Pasa-port, Alsancak, Bayraklı, Karşıyaka and Bostanlı along the coast of the inner bay. The annual fish-ing efforts demonstrated significant differences among districts. For example; Bostanlı fishers that have higher education levels with higher income spent higher time for RF but, finally, this attitude of Bostanlı fishers resulted in low CPUE levels. Considering the RF experience of Bostanlı fishers, they are either not likely or able to target or catch bigger or more fish. In contrast, Göztepe fish-ers seems much professional compared to fishers by having the highest amount of catch in shortest time compared to rest of the districts. The highest mean CPUE was observed for Göztepe, Karataş and Konak fishers even so, these CPUE amounts were much under the ones determined in previous studies in Turkey. Considering the catch composition of fishers, S. auratus was the most common catch for all fishers. Secondly, D. labrax and Mugilid species constituted the majority. High fishing related expenditures were observed in all districts, then harvesting values reached quite high levels considering the previous studies. To conclude, RF in İzmir Inner Bay of Turkey is great social and economic activity by generating increase in RF related expenditures, jobs and indirect economic activity in services sector. The results of this study provide an update information of the recreational fishers’ profile to help regulate recreational fishery.",

Three types of experimental collector made from vegetable sacks, modelled based on the collectors used in Japan, were placed in four existing fish and shellfish farms located in the Boka Kotorska Bay. The experimental collectors were placed in the periods June–October and June–December 2017 and the period August 2017–February 2018 and monitored after immersion of four to six months, respectively. In total, 18 species of molluscs and also 28 species of biofouling organisms were determined. The most abundant ones found on the collectors were the following shellfish species (68 %) Talohlamys multistriata, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Modiolarca sp., Anomia ephippium and Limaria hians. The most abundant group of biofouling organisms were crustaceans (18 percent) with a species of porcelain crab, Pisidia longicornis, and tunicates (5 percent) with the species Phallusia mammillataand Ascidia mentula. The main target species, Great Mediterranean scallop, was most abundant on collector Type II,with 28 individuals. From three types of experimental collectors used in the process of collecting larvae of shellfish and biofouling species, collector type-I and type-II proved to be a more suitable basis for receiving larvae of shellfish due to the unimpeded flow of sea water that allows their successful growth and development. Species Talochlamys multistriata, were found in great abundance and it could be good candidate to diversify the aquaculture production, thus potentially offering farmers an additional source of income.",

    "abstract": "The use of citizen science and opportunity sampling during commercial or tourist voyages can provide valuable insights into the structuring of the marine plankton community in broad biogeographic areas. With the goal of studying the distribution and abundance of smaller zooplankton using citizen science approach, plankton samples were collected at 33 stations spanning from the Arctic to Antarctic during the cruise of the S/V “Croatian Tern” (1994-1997), using vertical tows with a 53µm mesh size Nansen net in the upper epipelagic layer. In this study, we summarize the observed distribution patterns of planktonic copepods by ontogenetic stages (nauplii, copepodites, adults) and by postnaupliar assemblages (calanoids, oithonids, oncaeids, harpacticoids, corycaeids), reporting also on the numerical ratio of nauplii to postnaupliar copepods, as an important indicator of the stability of copepod reproduction. The highest abundances of total copepods were found in the northeastern and southeastern Pacific, while the lowest values were found in the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Ocean. Overall, the copepod community was dominated by naupliar stages, while most postnaupliar assemblages (calanoids, oithonids, and oncaeids) were dominated by copepodites. Spatially, nauplii and postnaupliar oithonids showed similar latitudinal patterns, with both assemblages dominating in high latitudes of temperate zones on both sides of the equator, while contributions of calanoids, oncaeids, and corycaeids increased at lower latitudes. The ratio of nauplii to postnauplii varied from 1.1 to 6.4, and only at five stations was it slightly &amp;lt; 1. Latitudinally, the median values of this ratio varied from 1.1 in the marginal Arctic to 3.1 in the South Pacific, with no statistically significant differences among areas. The sudden change in nauplii/ postnauplii ratio could signal disturbances in the copepod community, provided that the average values are determined for all marine areas under different productivity conditions.",

In this study, we applied a fuzzy rule-based system to model the spatial distribution of Mnemiopsis leidyi in the Black Sea and predict the probability of its presence throughout the sea. Six variables were used as predictors, including water turbidity, organic and inorganic particulate carbon, photosynthetically active radiation, light absorption by phytoplankton, sea surface temperature, and chlorophyll-a concentration. The results revealed a 0.807 accuracy of the model based on the confusion matrix. The results also showed that photosynthetically active radiation and sea surface temperature were the most important predictors shaping the distribution of this species. The findings also showed that the northern Black Sea was with the highest probability of presence, especially in Ukraine and Russia’s coastal areas. In the coastal areas of Turkey, the highest presence probability was found near Rize, Trabzon, Ordu, and from Sinop to Zonguldak. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the Turkish coastal area is crucial to better understanding the effects of climate change and anthropogenic influences on the further distribution patterns of this invasive ctenophore in the southeastern Black Sea.",

    "abstract": "The growth rate of the few months old Mediterranean amberjack was studied throughout a period of one year in the Bay of Mali Ston. Sixty-nine fish with an average weight of 183 (SD=57.5) g and total length of 25.2 (SD=2.8) cm were settled in rearing cages (5x5x5m) on September 27. 1995 for the purpose of studying growth in weight and length. The fish were usually fed frozen sardines once a day, every other day. The first month of rearing the fish showed considerable growth in weight 328 (SD=92.7) g and length 28 (SD=2.5 cm). At the end of the one-year period, the reared fish averaged 1239 g (SD=129, 8) in weight and 47.8 cm (SD=1.7) in length. The condition factor throughout the etire period of rearing was relatively homogenous, at 1.38 (SD=0.15). Significant gains in the weight and length of fish can be noticed during the warmer periods of the year, while less are for the colder months. The fish preferred frozen sardines. During this experiment, we noted the mortality of 7 fish (10, 1%). Moreover, the sudden oscillations in the basic hydrographic parameters for this relatively enclosed bay can be attributed to the influence of th river Neretva.",

It is the first record of this species in the Adriatic Sea. The decapod biodiversity of deeper coralligenous habitats, such as the red coral colonies, is poorly investigated in contrast to coastal areas and soft bottoms of traditional trawling grounds. This paper highlights the usefulness of examining the remnants of a commercial coral extraction originating from previously less investigated marine habitats in order to improve the knowledge on the biodiversity of such habitats.",

A total of 1027 individuals were collected monthly from September 2011 to August 2012. The total length of the individuals in the sample ranged from 7.46 cm to 14.62 cm with a female to male ratio of 1 to 0.59. Positive allometric growth was observed for both females (b=3.07) and males (b=3.08). Variations of condition factor were similar in both sexes with mean values of 1.07 for females and 1.01 for males. The fish L. dieuzeidei had a long spawning period extending from November to July based on monthly values of gonadosomatic index. Histological analysis showed that this fish was multiple synchronous developments of ovaries with multiple spawning events. The ovaries were always represented with a group of primary oocytes and a diverse population of vitel-logenic oocytes, each specially recruited during the final stages of maturation in uniform or uneven phases. Batch fecundity was estimated gravimetrically using the hydrated oocyte method and was estimated to be around 558 to 10.230 oocytes per female. L. dieuzeidei is an important by-catch species and data from this study represent a valuable contribution to stock management.",

    "abstract": "The histological structure and histochemical characteristics of the digestive tract of five specimens of salema porgy (Sarpa salpa, L.) were analysed using haematoxylin-eosin, Alcian blue/PAS and orcein-Giemsa staining techniques. The digestive system of salema porgy consists of esophagus, stomach and intestines with associated organs such as liver, pancreas and gallbladder. The wall of esophagus, stomach, intestines and gallbladder has four distinctive layers: the mucosa, the submucosa, the muscular and outer layer, serosa or adventitia. The mucosa consists of two different layers: epithelium and lamina propria. Mucosa of the upper part of the digestive system is layered by single squamous epithelium, while those of lower part of the digestive system is layered by single columnar epithelium. The submucosa is a layer made of connective tissue and blood vessels. In most parts of the digestive system the muscular layer consists of two parts: circular and longitudinal. The exception is the muscular layer of the stomach fundus which has three layers: inner, medium and outer. The outermost layer in the esophagus is adventitia made of connective tissue, blood vessels and nerves. In the stomach, intestines and the gallbladder this layer is replaced by serosa. Histochemical analysis has shown that mucosal cells in all parts of the digestive tube contain acid mucopolysaccharides (MPS). The liver consists of hepatocytes separated by sinusoidal capillaries. The pancreatic tissue is scattered along the liver parenchyma and along the wall of pyloric caeca. The present study is the first record on digestive system histology of salema porgy showing that it is congruent to its feeding habits.",
