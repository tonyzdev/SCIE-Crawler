E V operads and V -fold loop G-spacesIn this geometrically focused chapter, we first define E V operads and give two examples.We then relate E V -spaces to V -fold loop G-spaces via the equivariant approximation theorem and recognition principle.The approximation theorem shows how to approximate \"free\" V -fold loop G-spaces Ω V Σ V X in terms of free algebras D V X or K V X over the E V operad D V or K V .The recognition principle shows how to construct V -fold loop spaces from E V -algebras.We elaborate multiplicatively by showing how machine-built pairings relate to evident pairings between iterated loop G-spaces.We then give a geometric version of a concrete spacewise infinite loop G-space machine that does not use E ∞ operads and is new even nonequivariantly.This gives a geometric precursor of the BPQ theorem that relates well to smash products.As already noted, we envision that the theory here can provide the local data for an as yet undeveloped equivariant factorization homology theory.1.1.",

We also define a kind of \"braided Hopf algebra action\" on the set of bottom tangles.

The functor J, together with the set of generators of B, provides an algebraic method to study the range of quantum invariants of links. The braided Hopf algebra action on bottom tangles is mapped by J to the standard braided Hopf algebra structure for H in Mod_H. Several notions in knot theory, such as genus, unknotting number, ribbon knots, boundary links, local moves, etc are given algebraic interpretations in the setting involving the category B.

The main idea (stated here a little imprecisely) is that D(X) is the category of modules over the shifted tangent sheaf, which is a Lie algebra object in D(X); the weight systems then arise from this Lie algebra in a standard way. The other main results are a description of the symmetric algebra, universal enveloping algebra, and Duflo isomorphism in this context, and the fact that a slight modification of D(X) has the structure of a braided ribbon category, which gives another way to look at the associated invariants of links. Our original motivation for this work was to try to gain insight into the Jacobi diagram algebras used in Vassiliev theory by looking at them in a new light, but there are other potential applications, in particular to the rigorous construction of the (1+1+1)-dimensional Rozansky-Witten TQFT, and to hyperkaehler geometry.",

The group of w-braids was studied (as \"{w}elded braids\") by Fenn-Rimanyi-Rourke and was shown to be isomorphic to the McCool group of \"basis-conjugating\" automorphisms of a free group Fn. Brendle-Hatcher, tracing back to Goldsmith, have shown this group to be a group of movies of flying rings in R3. Satoh studied several classes of w-knotted objects (as \"{w}eakly-virtual\") and has shown them to be closely related to certain classes of knotted surfaces in R4. So w-knotted objects are algebraically and topologically interesting. Here we study finite type invariants of w-knotted objects. Following Berceanu-Papadima, we construct homomorphic universal finite type invariants (\"expansions\") of w-braids and of w-tangles. We find that the universal finite type invariant of w-knots is essentially the Alexander polynomial. We find that the spaces Aw of \"arrow diagrams\" for w-knotted objects are related to not-necessarily-metrized Lie algebras. Many questions concerning w-knotted objects turn out to be equivalent to questions about Lie algebras. Most notably we find that a homomorphic expansion of w-knotted foams is essentially the same as a solution of the Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture (KV), thus giving a topological explanation to the work of Alekseev-Torossian work on KV and Drinfel'd associators. The true value of w-knots, though, is likely to emerge later, for we expect them to serve as a {w}armup example for the study of virtual knots. We expect v-knotted objects to provide the global context whose associated graded structure will be the Etingof-Kazhdan theory of quantization of Lie bialgebras.",

Finally, we compare the interleaving and convolution distances.",

This includes all infinite-type surfaces with an isolated puncture outside of two sporadic classes. Given such a surface, we construct an infinite family of intrinsically infinite-type mapping classes that act loxodromically on the relative arc graph $\\mathcal{A}(\\Sigma, p)$. J. Bavard produced such an element for the plane minus a Cantor set, and our result gives the first examples of such mapping classes for all other surfaces of type $\\mathcal{S}$. The elements we construct are the composition of three shift maps on $\\Sigma$, and we give an alternate characterization of these elements as a composition of a pseudo-Anosov on a finite-type subsurface of $\\Sigma$ and a standard shift map. We then explicitly find their limit points on the boundary of $\\mathcal{A}(\\Sigma,p)$ and their limiting geodesic laminations. Finally, we show that these infinite-type elements can be used to prove that Map$(\\Sigma,p)$ has an infinite-dimensional space of quasimorphisms.",

Thanks to the work of many authors, the problem remains open only when Sigma is the sphere, in which case exceptions to existence are known to occur. In this paper we describe new infinite series of exceptions, in particular previously unknown exceptions with Sigma~ not the sphere and with more than three branching points. All our series come with systematic explanations, based on several different techniques (including dessins d'enfants and decomposability) that we exploit to attack the problem, besides Hurwitz's classical technique based on permutations. Using decomposability we also establish an easy existence result.",

Part of its significance is due to the fact that certain geometric characterizations of a knot imply membership in various levels of the filtration. We show the counterpart of this fact for two new filtrations of $\\mathcal{C}$ due to Cochran-Harvey-Horn, the positive and negative filtrations, denoted by $\\{\\mathcal{P}_n\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ and $\\{\\mathcal{N}_n\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$ respectively. In particular, we show that if a knot K bounds a Casson tower of height n+2 in the 4-ball with only positive (resp. negative) kinks in the base-level kinky disk, then K is in $\\mathcal{P}_n$ (resp. $\\mathcal{N}_n$). En route to this result we show that if a knot K bounds a Casson tower of height n+2 in the 4-ball, it bounds an embedded (symmetric) grope of height n+2, and is therefore, n-solvable (this also implies that topologically slice knots bound arbitrarily tall gropes in the 4-ball). We also define a variant of Casson towers and show that if K bounds a tower of type (2,n) in the 4-ball, it is n-solvable. If K bounds such a tower with only positive (resp. negative) kinks in the base-level kinky disk then K is in $\\mathcal{P}_n$ (resp. $\\mathcal{N}_n$). Our results show that either every knot which bounds a Casson tower of height three is topologically slice or there exists a knot which is not topologically slice but lies in each $\\mathcal{F}_n$. We also give a 3-dimensional characterization, up to concordance, of knots which bound kinky disks in the 4-ball with only positive (resp. negative) kinks; such knots form a subset of $\\mathcal{P}_0$ (resp. $\\mathcal{N}_0$).",

This boundary turns out to appear naturally in the context of Guba and Sapir's diagram groups, and we apply our main criterion to determine precisely when an element of a diagram group induces a contracting isometry on the associated Farley cube complex. As a consequence, in some specific case, we are able to deduce a criterion to determine precisely when a diagram group is acylindrically hyperbolic.",

It is therefore natural to investigate the extent to which the homotopy type of a space is determined by having such a cohomology ring. We begin this study here, in the context of model category theory. In particular, we extend work of Franz by showing that the singular cochain algebra of c(K) is formal as a differential graded noncommutative algebra. We specialise to the rationals by proving the corresponding result for Sullivan's commutative cochain algebra, and deduce that the rationalisation of c(K) is unique for a special family of complexes K. In a sequel, we will consider the uniqueness of c(K) at each prime separately, and apply Sullivan's arithmetic square to produce global results for this family.",

The filtered chain homotopy type also gives rise to a \"family Floer homology\" to which the spectral sequence converges. For any particular version of Floer theory, some analysis needs to be carried out in order to turn this principle into a theorem.

Next, we demonstrate that minimally intersecting filling pairs are combinatorially optimal, in the sense that there are many simple closed curves intersecting the pair exactly once.

While every plane graph arises as a Tait graph of a unique link diagram, not every embedded graph represents a link diagram. Furthermore, although a Tait graph describes a unique link diagram, the same embedded graph can represent many different link diagrams. One is then led to ask which embedded graphs represent link diagrams, and how link diagrams presented by the same embedded graphs are related to one another. Here we answer these questions by characterizing the class of embedded graphs that represent link diagrams, and then using this characterization to find a move that relates all of the link diagrams that are presented by the same set of embedded graphs.",

In describing twisted differential spectra we build on the work of Bunke-Nikolaus, but we find it useful for our purposes to take an approach that highlights direct analogies with classical bundles and that is at the same time amenable for calculations. We will, in particular, establish that twisted differential spectra are bundles of spectra equipped with a flat connection. Our prominent case will be twisted differential K-theory, for which we work out the differentials in detail. This involves differential refinements of primary and secondary cohomology operations the authors developed in earlier papers. We illustrate our constructions and computational tools with examples.",

The first obstruction is Wall's self-intersection number mu(f) which tells the whole story in higher dimensions. Our second order obstruction tau(f) is defined if mu(f) vanishes and has formally very similar properties, except that it lies in a quotient of the group ring of two copies of pi_1(X) modulo S_3-symmetry (rather then just one copy modulo S_3-symmetry). It generalizes to the non-simply connected setting the Kervaire-Milnor invariant which corresponds to the Arf-invariant of knots in 3-space. We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for moving three maps f_1,f_2,f_3:S^2 --> X^4 to a position in which they have disjoint images. Again the obstruction lambda(f_1,f_2,f_3) generalizes Wall's intersection number lambda(f_1,f_2) which answers the same question for two spheres but is not sufficient (in dimension 4) for three spheres. In the same way as intersection numbers correspond to linking numbers in dimension 3, our new invariant corresponds to the Milnor invariant mu(1,2,3), generalizing the Matsumoto triple to the non simply-connected setting.",

    "abstract": "Cofiltered diagrams of spectra, also called pro-spectra, have arisen in diverse areas, and to date have been treated in an ad hoc manner.The purpose of this paper is to systematically develop a homotopy theory of pro-spectra and to study its relation to the usual homotopy theory of spectra, as a foundation for future applications.The surprising result we find is that our homotopy theory of pro-spectra is Quillen equivalent to the opposite of the homotopy theory of spectra.This provides a convenient duality theory for all spectra, extending the classical notion of Spanier-Whitehead duality which works well only for finite spectra.Roughly speaking, the new duality functor takes a spectrum to the cofiltered diagram of the Spanier-Whitehead duals of its finite subcomplexes.In the other direction, the duality functor takes a cofiltered diagram of spectra to the filtered colimit of the Spanier-Whitehead duals of the spectra in the diagram.We prove the equivalence of homotopy theories by showing that both are equivalent to the category of ind-spectra (filtered diagrams of spectra).To construct our new homotopy theories, we prove a general existence theorem for colocalization model structures generalizing known results for cofibrantly generated model categories.",

An n-fold functor is a weak equivalence if and only if the diagonal of its n-fold nerve is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets. This is an n-fold analogue to Thomason's Quillen model structure on Cat. We introduce an n-fold Grothendieck construction for multisimplicial sets, and prove that it is a homotopy inverse to the n-fold nerve. As a consequence, we completely prove that the unit and counit of the adjunction between simplicial sets and n-fold categories are natural weak equivalences.",

The notion of generalized satellite operators yields a characterization of surjective satellite operators, as well as a sufficient condition for a satellite operator to have an inverse. As a consequence, we are able to construct infinitely many non-trivial satellite operators P such that there is a satellite operator $\\overline{P}$ for which $\\overline{P}(P(K))$ is concordant to K (topologically as well as smoothly in a potentially exotic $S^3\\times [0,1]$) for all knots K; we show that these satellite operators are distinct from all connected-sum operators, even up to concordance, and that they induce bijective functions on topological concordance classes of knots, as well as smooth concordance classes of knots modulo the smooth 4--dimensional Poincare Conjecture.",

In answer to a question initiated by D.N. Yetter and P.J. Freyd, this article classifies formal deformations of c_Q in the space of Yang-Baxter operators. For the trivial rack, where x^y = x for all x,y, one has, of course, the classical setting of r-matrices and quantum groups. In the general case we introduce and calculate the cohomology theory that classifies infinitesimal deformations of c_Q. In many cases this allows us to conclude that c_Q is rigid.

For infinite discrete groups, it is necessary to take into account deformations of representations, and with this in mind we replace the representation ring by Carlsson's deformation $K$--theory spectrum $\\K (\\Gamma)$ (the homotopy-theoretical analogue of $R(\\Gamma)$). Our main theorem provides an isomorphism in homotopy $\\K_*(\\pi_1 \\Sigma)\\isom K^{-*}(\\Sigma)$ for all compact, aspherical surfaces $\\Sigma$ and all $*>0$.

    "abstract": "We consider contact elements in the sutured Floer homology of solid tori with longitudinal sutures, as part of the (1+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theory defined by Honda--Kazez--Mati\\'{c} in \\cite{HKM08}. The $\\Z_2$ $SFH$ of these solid tori forms a \"categorification of Pascal's triangle\", and contact structures correspond bijectively to chord diagrams, or sets of disjoint properly embedded arcs in the disc. Their contact elements are distinct and form distinguished subsets of $SFH$ of order given by the Narayana numbers. We find natural \"creation and annihilation operators\" which allow us to define a QFT-type basis of $SFH$, consisting of contact elements. Sutured Floer homology in this case reduces to the combinatorics of chord diagrams. We prove that contact elements are in bijective correspondence with comparable pairs of basis elements with respect to a certain partial order. The algebraic and combinatorial structures in this description have intrinsic contact-topological meaning. In particular, the QFT-basis of $SFH$ and its partial order have a natural interpretation in pure contact topology, related to the contact category of a disc: the partial order enables us to tell when the sutured solid cylinder obtained by \"stacking\" two chord diagrams has a tight contact structure. This leads us to extend Honda's notion of contact category to a \"bounded\" contact category, containing chord diagrams and contact structures which occur within a given contact solid cylinder. We compute this bounded contact category in certain cases. Moreover, the decomposition of a contact element into basis elements naturally gives a triple of contact structures on solid cylinders which we regard as a type of \"distinguished triangle\" in the contact category. We also use the algebraic structures arising among contact elements to extend the notion of contact category to a 2-category.",

    "abstract": "The universal Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariant is a functor from the category of tangles to a certain graded category of chord diagrams, compatible with the Vassiliev filtration and whose associated graded is an isomorphism. The Vassiliev filtration has a natural extension to tangles in any thickened surface $M\\times I$ but the corresponding category of diagrams lacks some finiteness properties which are essential to the above construction. We suggest to overcome this obstruction by studying families of Vassiliev invariants which, roughly, are associated to finite coverings of $M$. In the case $M=\\mathbb{C}^*$, it leads for each positive integer $N$ to a filtration on the space of tangles in $\\mathbb{C}^* \\times I$ (or \"B-tangles\"). We first prove an extension of the Shum--Reshetikhin--Turaev theorem in the framework of braided module category leading to B-tangles invariants. We introduce a category of \"$N$-chord diagrams\", and use a cyclotomic generalization of Drinfeld associators, introduced by Enriquez, to put a braided module category structure on it. We show that the corresponding functor from the category of B-tangles is a universal invariant with respect to the $N$ filtration. We show that Vassiliev invariants in the usual sense are well approximated by $N$ finite type invariants. We show that specializations of the universal invariant can be constructed from modules over a metrizable Lie algebra equipped with a finite order automorphism preserving the metric. In the case the latter is a \"Cartan\" automorphism, we use a previous work of the author to compute these invariants explicitly using quantum groups. Restricted to links, this construction provides polynomial invariants.",

Immediate applications include new proofs of Krcatovich's result that knots with $L$-space surgeries are prime and Hedden and Watson's result that the rank of knot Floer homology detects the trefoil among knots in the 3--sphere. We also generalize the latter result, proving a similar theorem for nullhomologous knots in any 3--manifold. We note that our method of proof inspired Baldwin and Sivek's recent proof that Khovanov homology detects the trefoils. As part of this work, we also introduce a numerical refinement of the Ozsv\\'ath-Szab\\'o contact invariant. This refinement was the inspiration for Hubbard and Saltz's annular refinement of Plamenevskaya's transverse link invariant in Khovanov homology.",

We rearrange the handles in such a way that the regular surfaces are as simple as possible. To make this precise the concept of circular width for E(K) is introduced. When E(K) is endowed with a handle decomposition which realizes the circular width we will say that the knot K is in circular thin position. We use this to show that many knots have more than one non-isotopic incompressible Seifert surface. We also analyze the behavior of the circular width under some knot operations.",

This converges strongly to H_*(X_0) when X is 0-connected. The E^1 term is the homology of the extended powers of X, and thus is a well known functor of H_*(X), including structure as a bigraded Hopf algebra, a right module over the mod 2 Steenrod algebra A, and a left module over the Dyer-Lashof operations. Hopf algebra considerations show that all pages of the spectral sequence are primitively generated, with primitives equal to a subquotient of the primitives in E^1. We use an operad structure on the tower and the Z/2 Tate construction to show how Dyer-Lashof operations and differentials interact. These then determine differentials that hold for any spectrum X. These universal differentials then lead us to construct, for every A-module M, an algebraic spectral sequence depending functorially on M. The algebraic spectral sequence for H_*(X) agrees with the topological spectral sequence for X for many spectra, including suspension spectra and almost all generalized Eilenberg-MacLane spectra, and appears to give an upper bound in general. The E^infty term of the algebraic spectral sequence has form and structure similar to E^1, but now the right A-module structure is unstable. Our explicit formula involves the derived functors of destabilization as studied in the 1980's by W. Singer, J. Lannes and S. Zarati, and P. Goerss.",

The first purpose of this paper is to give a direct effective definition of the iterated bar complexes of E-infinity algebras. We use this effective definition to prove that the n-fold bar complex B^n(A) admits an extension to categories of algebras over E_n-operads. Then we prove that the n-fold bar complex determines the homology theory associated to a category of algebras over E_n-operads.

    "abstract": "We show that the Morava K-theories of the groups of order 32 are concentrated in even degrees. Let G be a finite group and BG denote its classifying space. Determining the Morava K-theory of BG is generally difficult, mainly due to the weakness of existing methods of calculation, which all require knowledge of the cohomology of p-groups — in itself a notorious problem. Certain series of groups with particularly simple structure, such as wreath products, or groups having a cyclic maximal subgroup, or minimal non-abelian groups, are quite tractable, see e.g. the work of HopkinsKuhn-Ravenel [3], Hunton [4], and Yagita and his coauthors ([7], [10], [11], [12], [14]). A hard example is the 3-Sylow supgroup of GL4(F3): in [5], Kriz computes just enough of its 3-primary Morava K-theory to conclude that there are odd dimensional elements in it, thereby disproving a conjecture of Ravenel. A complete calculation however is still elusive. In later work by Kriz and Lee, this example was generalised to all n and all odd primes p [6]. In this note we shall consider the groups of order 32. In many cases the Morava K-theory is already known, or easily deduced from results in the literature. For the remaining groups, it was established in [8] that for n = 2 at least, their Morava K-theory K(n)∗(BG) is generated by transfers of Euler classes of complex representations. In other words, all groups of order 32 are “K(2)-good” in the sense of Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel. Some of the results however relied on computer calculations. This is to be remedied here, although we only prove a weaker statement: Theorem. Let G be a group of order 32. Then K(n)(BG) = 0. When starting this project, our objective of course was not to prove such a result, rather we hoped – rather naively, perhaps – that order 32 would be big enough to find a 2-primary counterexample to the even degree conjecture. In this we have failed and the problem remains open. We have not tried to determine ring structures. This should be possible in principle, using methods similar to those employed in [1], but since this paper is already so loaded with computations, we have refrained from doing so. The article is organised as follows. In Section 1, we recall a few old results used in the later calculations. Section 2 contains some technical lemmas. Section 3 collects all we need to know about the Morava K-theories of groups of smaller order. Section 4 lists the 51 groups of order 32 and disposes of those whose Morava Ktheory is either in the literature or can easily be read off from known computations. Finally, Section 5 contains the remaining calculations. Date: November 23, 2010. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 55R35, 55N20; Secondary 57T25.",

    "abstract": "Given an ideal triangulation of a connected 3-manifold with non-empty boundary consisting of a disjoint union of tori, a point of the deformation variety is an assignment of complex numbers to the dihedral angles of the tetrahedra subject to Thurston's gluing equations. From this, one can recover a representation of the fundamental group of the manifold into the isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. However, the deformation variety depends crucially on the triangulation: there may be entire components of the representation variety which can be obtained from the deformation variety with one triangulation but not another. We introduce a generalisation of the deformation variety, which again consists of assignments of complex variables to certain dihedral angles subject to polynomial equations, but together with some extra combinatorial data concerning degenerate tetrahedra. This \"extended deformation variety\" deals with many situations that the deformation variety cannot. In particular we show that for any ideal triangulation of a small orientable 3-manifold with a single torus boundary component, we can recover all of the irreducible non-dihedral representations from the associated extended deformation variety. More generally, we give an algorithm to produce a triangulation of a given orientable 3-manifold with torus boundary components for which the same result holds. As an application, we show that this extended deformation variety detects all factors of the PSL(2,C) A-polynomial associated to the components consisting of the representations it recovers.",

As a corollary, we obtain a lower bound for the growth constant, $\\sqrt[10]{2}$, which is uniform not just for a given group acting freely on a given CAT(0) cube complex, but for all groups which are not virtually abelian and have a free action on a CAT(0) square complex.",

This allows us to use the relative simplicity of the visual compactification to obtain properties regarding the horofunction compactification. Among other things, we show that the horoboundary is path connected and that its Busemann points are not dense, we determine for which surfaces the horofunction compactification is isomorphic to the visual one, and we show that some horocycles diverge in the visual compactification based at some point.

We find an isomorphism of complexes which reduces the complex to one in a simpler category. This reduction enables us to specify exactly the amount of information held within the geometric complex and thus state precisely its universality properties for link homology theories. We also determine its strength as a link invariant relative to the different topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) used to create link homology. We identify the most general (universal) TQFT that can be used to create link homology and find that it is \"smaller\" than the TQFT previously reported by Khovanov as the universal link homology theory. We give a new method of extracting all other link homology theories (including Khovanov's universal TQFT) directly from the universal geometric complex, along with new homology theories that hold a controlled amount of information. We achieve these goals by making a classification of surfaces (with boundaries) modulo the 4TU/S/T relations, a process involving the introduction of genus generating operators. These operators enable us to explore the relation between the geometric complex and its algebraic structure.",

In this paper we present algorithms for converting between solution sets in quadrilateral and standard coordinates. As a consequence we obtain a new algorithm for enumerating all standard vertex normal surfaces, yielding both the speed of quadrilateral coordinates and the wider applicability of standard coordinates. Experimentation with the software package Regina shows this new algorithm to be extremely fast in practice, improving speed for large cases by factors from thousands up to millions.",

We use these facts to show that Q ∆ sends categorical equivalences between simplicial sets to maps of connected dg coalgebras which induce quasi-isomorphisms of dga's under the cobar functor, which is strictly stronger than saying the resulting dg coalgebras are quasi-isomorphic.",

We find that there is another kind of change of structure that appears as one instead increases $b$: the number-theoretic \"infinite Pell stairs\" from the $b=1$ case almost completely disappears (only two steps remain), but in an appropriately rescaled limit, the function $c_b(a)$ converges as $b$ tends to infinity to a completely regular infinite staircase with steps all of the same height and width.",

    "abstract": "The Rips filtration over a finite metric space and its corresponding persistent homology are prominent methods in TDA to summarise the shape of data. Crucial to their use is the bottleneck stability result. A generalisation of the Rips filtration to any symmetric function $f:X\\times X\\to \\mathbb{R}$ was defined by Chazal, De Silva and Oudot, and they showed it was stable with respect to the correspondence distortion distance. Allowing asymmetry, we consider four different persistence modules. The first method is through symmetrisation. For $a\\in [0,1]$ we can construct a symmetric function $sym_a(f)(x,y)=a \\min \\{d(x,y), d(y,x)\\}+ (1-a)\\max \\{d(x,y), d(y,x)\\}$. We can then follow the apply the standard theory for symmetric functions and get stability as a corollary. The second method is to construct a filtration of ordered tuple complexes where tuple $(x_0, x_2, \\ldots x_p)\\in Rips^{dir}(X)_t$ if $d(x_i, x_j)\\leq t$ for all $i\\leq j$. These two methods have the same persistent homology as the standard Rips filtration when applied to a metric space, or more generally to a symmetric function. We consider two constructions using a filtration of directed graphs. We have directed graphs $\\{D(X)_t\\}$, where directed edges $x\\to y$ are included in $D(X)_t$ whenever $\\max\\{f(x,y),f(x,x),f(y,y)\\}\\leq t$. From this we construct a preorder where $x\\leq y$ if there is a path from $x$ to $y$ in $D(X)_t$. We build persistence modules using the strongly connected components of the graphs $D(X)_t$, which are the equivalence classes of the associated preorders. We consider persistence modules using a generalisation of poset topology to preorders. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance can be extended as a correspondence distortion distance to set-function pairs. We prove that all these new constructions enjoy the same stability results.",

From such series we obtain refinements of the n-solvable filtration.The operation of infection by a string link is then used to demonstrate that for particular M, certain quotients of successive terms of these refined filtrations have infinite rank.",

We generalize the notions of flag and belt in the setting of simple polytopes into the setting of simple orbifolds. To describe the topology and geometry of a simple orbifold in terms of its combinatorics, we focus on {\\em simple handlebodies} (that is, simple orbifolds which can be obtained from simple polytopes by gluing some disjoint specific codimension-one faces). We prove the following two main results in terms of combinatorics, which can be understood as \"Combinatorial Sphere Theorem\" and \"Combinatorial Flat Torus Theorem\" on simple handlebodies: (A) A simple handlebody is orbifold-aspherical if and only if it is flag. (B) There exists a rank-two free abelian subgroup in $\\pi_1^{orb}(Q)$ of an orbifold-aspherical simple handlebody $Q$ if and only if it contains an $\\square$-belt. Furthermore, based on such two results and some results of geometry, it is shown that the existence of some curvatures on a certain manifold cover (manifold double) over a simple handlebody $Q$ can be characterized in terms of the combinatorics of $Q$. In 3-dimensional case, together with the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, we can induce a pure combinatorial equivalent description for a simple $3$-handlebody to admit a right-angled hyperbolic structure, which is a natural generalization of Pogorelov Theorem.",

We show that the $KO^*(pt)$-valued index associated with the $G^{\\pm}(n,s^+,s^-)$ structure is localized to the characteristic submanifold.

The first formula treats the case when $L$ is a boundary link with $n$ components, while the second one is for $3n$--component algebraically split links. In the third formula, the link $L$ has $2n$ components and the Milnor triple linking numbers of its 3--component sublinks vanish. The presented formulae are then applied to the study of the variation of $Z_n$ under a $p/q$-surgery on a knot $K$. This variation is a degree $n$ polynomial in $q/p$ when the class of $q/p$ in $\\QQ/\\ZZ$ is fixed, and the coefficients of these polynomials are knot invariants, for which various topological properties or topological definitions are given.",

We describe the factorization homology $\\int_M Th(f)$ as the Thom spectrum associated to a certain map $\\int _M A \\to BO$. When $M$ is framed and $X$ is $(n-1)$-connected, this spectrum is equivalent to a Thom spectrum of a virtual bundle over the mapping space $Map_c(M,X)$; in general, this is a Thom spectrum of a virtual bundle over a certain section space. This can be viewed as a twisted form of the non-abelian Poincar\\'e duality theorem of Segal, Salvatore, and Lurie, which occurs when $f: A \\to BO$ is nullhomotopic. This result also generalizes the results of Blumberg-Cohen-Schlichtkrull on the topological Hochschild homology of Thom spectra, and of Schlichtkrull on higher topological Hochschild homology of Thom spectra. We use this to calculate the factorization homology of some Thom spectra, including the classical cobordism spectra, spectra arising from systems of groups, and the Eilenberg-MacLane spectra $H \\mathbb{Z}/p$, $H\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$, and $H\\mathbb{Z}$. We build upon the description of the factorization homology of Thom spectra to study the ($n=1$ and higher) topological Hochschild cohomology of Thom spectra, which enables calculations and a description in terms of sections of a parametrized spectrum. If $X$ is a closed manifold, Atiyah duality for parametrized spectra allows us to deduce a duality between $E_n$ topological Hochschild homology and $E_n$ topological Hochschild cohomology, recovering string topology operations when $f$ is nullhomotopic. In conjunction with the higher Deligne conjecture, this gives $E_{n+1}$ structures on a certain family of Thom spectra, which were not previously known to be ring spectra.",

The theorem generalizes a result by C. Dwyer, who has proven the theorem for finite G and twistings of a more restricted type. While versions of the general result have been known to experts, to our knowledge no proof appears in the current literature. Our goal is to fill in this gap. The proof we give proceeds in two stages. We first prove the theorem in the case of a twisting arising from a graded central extension of G, following the Adams-Haeberly-Jackowski-May proof of the classical Atiyah-Segal completion theorem. After establishing that the theorem holds for this special class of twistings, we then deduce the general theorem by a Mayer-Vietoris argument.",

A torus manifold is an oriented, closed, smooth manifold of dimension $2n$ with an effective action of a compact torus $T^{n}$ having a non-empty fixed point set. Hence, a torus manifold can be thought of as a generalization of a toric manifold. In the present paper, we focus on a certain class $\\mM$ in the family of torus manifolds with codimension one extended actions, and we give a topological classification of $\\mM$. As a result, their topological types are completely determined by their cohomology rings and real characteristic classes. The problem whether the cohomology ring determines the topological type of a toric manifold or not is one of the most interesting open problems in toric topology. One can also ask this problem for the class of torus manifolds even if its orbit spaces are highly structured. Our results provide a negative answer to this problem for torus manifolds. However, we find a sub-class of torus manifolds with codimension one extended actions which is not in the class of toric manifolds but which is classified by their cohomology rings.",

The focus of the following is to construct complex cobordism polynomial generators in many dimensions using smooth projective toric varieties. These generators are very convenient objects since they are smooth connected algebraic varieties with an underlying combinatorial structure that aids in various computations. By applying certain torus-equivariant blow-ups to a special class of smooth projective toric varieties, such generators can be constructed in every complex dimension that is odd or one less than a prime power. A large amount of evidence suggests that smooth projective toric varieties can serve as polynomial generators in the remaining dimensions as well.",

The homotopy type of the type A structure is a tangle invariant, and homotopy equivalences of the type A structure result in chain homotopy equivalences on the Khovanov chain complex. We can use this to simplify computations and introduce a modular approach to the computation of Khovanov homologies. This approach adds to the literature even in the case of a connect sum, where the techniques here will allow an exact computation of Khovanov homology from the structures for two tangles coming from the summands. Several examples are included, showing in particular how we can compute the correct torsion summands for the Khovanov homology of the connect sum. A lengthy appendix is devoted to establishing the theory of these structures over a characterstic zero ring.",

More precisely, the cohomology of $G$ with group ring coefficients is dual to a certain Cech homology group of the family of increasing neighborhoods of a $G$-orbit in $X$. This duality applies more generally to coarse embeddings of certain contractible simplicial complexes into coarse $PD(n)$ spaces. In this paper we introduce a relative version of this Cech homology that satisfies the Eilenberg-Steenrod Exactness Axiom, and we prove a relative version of coarse Alexander duality. \r\nAs an application we provide a detailed proof of the following result, first stated by Kapovich-Kleiner. Given a $2$-complex formed by gluing $k$ halfplanes along their boundary lines and a coarse embedding into a contractible $3$-manifold, the complement consists of $k$ deep components that are arranged cyclically in a pattern called a \\emph{Jordan cycle}. We use the Jordan cycle as an invariant in proving the existence of a $3$-manifold group that is virtually Kleinian but not itself Kleinian.",

We show that every self-transverse immersed surface in a smooth, orientable, closed 4-manifold can be represented by a singular banded unlink diagram, and that such representations are uniquely determined by the ambient isotopy or equivalence class of the surface up to a set of singular band moves which we define explicitly. By introducing additional finger, Whitney, and cusp diagrammatic moves, we can use these singular band moves to describe homotopies or regular homotopies as well. \r\nUsing these techniques, we introduce bridge trisections of immersed surfaces in arbitrary trisected 4-manifolds and prove that such bridge trisections exist and are unique up to simple perturbation moves.

    "abstract": "Joyal and Street note in their paper on braided monoidal categories [Braided tensor categories, Advances in Math. 102(1993) 20-78] that the 2-category V-Cat of categories enriched over a braided monoidal category V is not itself braided in any way that is based upon the braiding of V. The exception that they mention is the case in which V is symmetric, which leads to V-Cat being symmetric as well. The symmetry in V-Cat is based upon the symmetry of V. The motivation behind this paper is in part to describe how these facts relating V and V-Cat are in turn related to a categorical analogue of topological delooping. To do so I need to pass to a more general setting than braided and symmetric categories -- in fact the k-fold monoidal categories of Balteanu et al in [Iterated Monoidal Categories, Adv. Math. 176(2003) 277-349]. It seems that the analogy of loop spaces is a good guide for how to define the concept of enrichment over various types of monoidal objects, including k-fold monoidal categories and their higher dimensional counterparts. The main result is that for V a k-fold monoidal category, V-Cat becomes a (k-1)-fold monoidal 2-category in a canonical way. In the next paper I indicate how this process may be iterated by enriching over V-Cat, along the way defining the 3-category of categories enriched over V-Cat. In future work I plan to make precise the n-dimensional case and to show how the group completion of the nerve of V is related to the loop space of the group completion of the nerve of V-Cat. This paper is an abridged version of `Enrichment as categorical delooping I' math.CT/0304026.",

    "abstract": "This is the second in a series of papers in which we investigate ideal triangulations of the interiors of compact 3-manifolds with tori or Klein bottle boundaries. Such triangulations have been used with great effect, following the pioneering work of Thurston. Ideal triangulations are the basis of the computer program SNAPPEA of Weeks and the program SNAP of Coulson, Goodman, Hodgson and Neumann. Casson has also written a program to find hyperbolic structures on such 3-manifolds, by solving Thurston's hyperbolic gluing equations for ideal triangulations. In this second paper, we study the question of when a taut ideal triangulation of an irreducible atoroidal 3-manifold admits a family of angle structures. We find a combinatorial obstruction, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of angle structures for taut triangulations. The hope is that this result can be further developed to give a proof of the existence of ideal triangulations admitting (complete) hyperbolic metrics. Our main result answers a question of Lackenby. We give simple examples of taut ideal triangulations which do not admit an angle structure. Also we show that for `layered' ideal triangulations of once-punctured torus bundles over the circle, that if the manodromy is pseudo Anosov, then the triangulation admits angle structures if and only if there are no edges of degree 2. Layered triangulations are generalisations of Thurston's famous triangulation of the Figure 8 knot space. Note that existence of an angle structure easily implies that the 3-manifold has a CAT(0) or relatively word hyperbolic fundamental group.",

We also produce simply-connected, strongly chiral manifolds in every dimension 7.For every k 1, we exhibit lens spaces with an orientation-reversing self-diffeomorphism of order 2 k but no self-map of degree 1 of smaller order.55M25; 57S17, 57N65, 57R19 IntroductionIn this paper, we study the question of whether a manifold admits an orientationreversing self-map.Let M be a closed, connected, orientable manifold in one of the categories TOP, PL or DIFF.We call M chiral if it does not admit an orientation-reversing automorphism in the respective category and amphicheiral if it does.For the sake of clarity, we indicate the category by adverbs: eg a topologically chiral manifold does not admit an orientation-reversing self-homeomorphism, whereas a smoothly amphicheiral manifold is a differentiable manifold which admits an orientation-reversing selfdiffeomorphism.We extend this by the notion of homotopical chirality/amphicheirality when we consider homotopy self-equivalences.Chiral manifolds in the strongest sense do not admit self-maps of degree 1; we call them strongly chiral and define weakly amphicheiral as the opposite.The definition of chirality may be extended to nonclosed manifolds and to oriented manifolds with several components, both of which are not in the focus of the present work.Many familiar manifolds like spheres or orientable surfaces are smoothly amphicheiral: in these cases mirror-symmetric embeddings into R n exist, and reflection at the \"equatorial\" hyperplane reverses the orientation.On the other hand, instances of strongly chiral manifolds have been known for many decades, eg the complex projective spaces CP 2k or some lens spaces in dimensions congruent 3 mod 4.",

Here we take a different approach, namely we study C as a metric space admitting many natural geometric operators, especially satellite operators. We consider several knot concordance spaces, corresponding to different categories of concordance, and two different metrics. We establish the existence of quasi-n-flats for every n, implying that C admits no quasi-isometric embedding into a finite product of (Gromov) hyperbolic spaces. We show that every satellite operator is a quasi-homomorphism P: C --- C with respect to the metric given by the slice genus. We show that winding number one satellite operators induce quasi-isometries. We prove that strong winding number one satellite operators induce isometric embeddings for certain metrics. By contrast, winding number zero satellite operators are bounded functions and hence quasi-contractions. These results contribute to the conjecture that C is a fractal space. We establish various other results about the large-scale geometry of arbitrary satellite operators.",

We then generalise open topological conformal field theories to open Klein topological conformal field theories and give a generators and relations description of the open KTCFT operad. We deduce an analogue of the ribbon graph decomposition of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces: a Mobius graph decomposition of the moduli spaces of Klein surfaces (real algebraic curves).

Such a 4-manifold is necessarily homeomorphic to a (punctured) connected sum of CP(2)'s. We characterize all links that are slice in a (punctured) connected sum of CP(2)'s in terms of ribbon moves and an operation which we call adding a generalized positive crossing. We find obstructions in the form of the Levine-Tristram signature function, the signs of the first author's generalized Sato-Levine invariants, and certain Milnor's invariants. We show that the signs of coefficients of the Conway polynomial obstruct a 2-component link from being slice in a single punctured CP(2) and conjecture these are obstructions in general. These results have applications to the question of when a 3-manifold bounds a 4-manifold whose intersection form is that of some connected sum of CP(2)'s. For example, we show that any homology 3-sphere is cobordant, via a smooth positive definite manifold, to a connected sum of surgeries on knots in the 3-sphere.",

When the level r is prime, we show that the asymptotic distribution of the absolute value of these invariants is given by the standard Rayleigh distribution and independent of the choice of level. Hence the probability that the quantum invariant certifies the Heegaard genus of a random 3-manifold of a fixed Heegaard genus g is positive but very small, less than 10^-7 except when g &lt; 4. We also examine random surface bundles over the circle and find the same distribution for quantum invariants there.",

    "abstract": "The construction just described easily extends to pairs .M; s/ with M a compact oriented 3-manifold with nonempty boundary and s a spin structure on M, by using branchable triangulations of M with ideal vertices at the components of @M, and possibly internal vertices.Recall that a triangulation of M with ideal vertices is a triangulation of the space obtained from M by collapsing each component of @M to a point, so that each collapsed component of @M is a vertex, which is called the ideal vertex associated to the component.A triangulation of M is ideal if it has ideal vertices only, and in this case the interior of M is the triangulation space minus the ideal vertices.However, this approach suffers from the drawback that not all triangulations of M are branchable: for instance, the canonical triangulation by two regular hyperbolic ideal tetrahedra of the hyperbolic one-cusped manifold called the \"figure-eight-knot-sister\" is not branchable.On the one hand, one easily sees that any triangulation of M has branchable subdivisions (for example, take a regular subdivision and define a branching by choosing a total ordering of the vertices).On the other hand, in many circumstances one is interested in sticking to a given triangulation of M, or to consider the class of all vertex-efficient triangulations of M (namely, the purely ideal triangulations for nonempty @M, and the 1-vertex triangulations for closed M ).Recently, generalized versions of the notion of branching (see the definitions below), with the nice property of existing on every triangulation, have emerged as useful devices to deal with simplicial formulas defined over triangulations equipped with solutions of Thurston's PSL.2; C/ consistency equations (or variations of them; see Luo and Schlenker [13] and Luo Tillmann and Yang [14]).For instance, motivated by his work in progress on the entropy of solutions of the homogeneous PSL.2; R/ Thurston equations, Luo introduced the notion of Z=2Z-taut structure on a triangulation, and it turns out that a certain notion of weak branching, widely employed below together with the underlying notion of prebranching, easily allows us to show that every triangulation admits Z=2Z-taut structures (see Remark 1.2).As another example, the same notions of weak branching and prebranching were exploited by Baseilhac and the first author in [2] to extend the construction of quantum hyperbolic invariants [4; 3] to an arbitrary hyperbolic one-cusped manifold, over a canonical Zariski-open set of the geometric component of its character variety.In several instances Luo [12] suggested that a combinatorial encoding of spin structures based on arbitrary triangulations might be of use for the construction of spin-refined invariants obtained from simplicial formulas as those mentioned in the previous paragraph.In this note we provide such a presentation, using the notion of weak branching already alluded to.The results established in this paper provide an \"objects/moves\" combinatorial presen-",

Kontsevich [Kon94], S. Axelrod and I. M. Singer [AS92] proposed the Chern-Simons perturbation theory and gave a topological invariant of 3-manifolds.Based on Kontsevich' s work, G. Kuperberg and D. Thurston constructed in [KT99] a topological invariant z KKT of rational homology 3-spheres.Kuperberg and Thurston proved that z KKT is a universal finite type invariant for homology 3-spheres by showing surgery formulas.C. Lescop obtained surgery formulas of other types in [Les04b] and [Les09].Lescop reviewed z KKT and gave a more direct proof of welldefinedness of this invariant in [Les04a].K. Fukaya [Fuk96] constructed a topological invariant of 3-manifolds with local coefficients using Morse functions.Fukaya's invariant is closely related to the theta graph θ.His invariant essentially takes values in A 1 (∅).M. Futaki [Fut06] pointed out that Fukaya's invariant depends on the choice of Morse functions.T. Watanabe [Wat12] gave an invariant of rational homology 3-spheres without local coefficients using Morse functions.He also investigated higher loop graphs (and broken graphs) and then he defined a topological invariant z FW 2n,3n of (rational) homology 3-spheres taking values in A n (∅) for each n ∈ N. The construction of z FW 2,3 is related to the construction of a Morse propagator constructed by Lescop [Les12a].Fukaya's construction is inspired by the construction of the 2-loop term of the Chern-Simons perturbation theory and he conjectured in §8 in [Fuk96] that his invariant is related to the 2-loop term of the Chern-Simons perturbation theory.",

On the other hand, there is an additional assumption in Theorem C, namely that the subgraph ƒ of can have at most two components.When ƒ contains more than two components, the situation becomes much more complex.We show that additional graph-theoretic conditions are necessary to generalize the Theorem C to this setting (see Lemmas 3.32 and 3.34).Remarkably, a consequence of these conditions is that if is triangle-free and .G; E.ƒ// is a finite-index RAAG system, then ƒ can have at most two components.This fact is crucial to the proof of Theorem A, which does not have any assumption on the number of components of ƒ.Additionally, we are aware that even more conditions are necessary than those in this article, but we do not have a complete conjectural list of conditions that would be sufficient to characterize visual RAAGs.We next turn our attention to RAAG subgroups of RAAGs.A classical theorem on Coxeter groups, proven independently by Deodhar [1989] and Dyer [1990], states that reflection subgroups of Coxeter groups (ie those generated by conjugates of generators) are themselves Coxeter groups.In fact, Dyer proves an analogous result for the class of groups defined by reflection systems (see [Dyer 1990] for the definition), which includes Coxeter groups as well as RAAGs.Specifically, he shows that subgroups generated by conjugates of standard generators are themselves in this class.As RAAGs are the only torsion-free groups in this class, one obtains the following result.Here, we define a generalized RAAG reflection to be an element of a RAAG A that is conjugate to a generator in V ./.Theorem D [Dyer 1990] Letbe a finite set of generalized RAAG reflections in the RAAG A .Then the subgroup G < A generated byis a RAAG.We thank Luis Paris for informing us that this result is contained in [Dyer 1990], and the explanation in the preceding paragraph.We include our proof of Theorem D, as our geometric approach is very different from that of Dyer, which is algebraic and uses cocycles.Our proof uses a characterization of RAAG systems in terms of the deletion condition, given by Basarab [2002].We use disk diagrams to show that subgroups generated by generalized RAAG reflections satisfy the criteria in Basarab's characterization.We note that, although G (from Theorem D) is a RAAG, .G; -/ is not necessarily a RAAG system and in general G is not isomorphic to the RAAG A where is the commuting graph corresponding to -. Kim and Koberda [2013] show that there exists a subgroup of G (generated by sufficiently high powers of the elements of -) which is isomorphic to A .Genevois, as well as an anonymous referee, pointed out to us that a proof of Theorem D may be possible using [Genevois 2017, Theorem 10.54] (see also [Genevois 2019, Theorem 3.24]).",

From this, we derive a formula to compute the integral cohomology group of ᐆ Q via the strata of Q.This generalizes the Hochster's formula for the moment-angle manifold over a simple convex polytope.Moreover, we obtain a description of the integral cohomology ring of ᐆ Q using the idea of partial diagonal maps.In addition, we define the notion of polyhedral product of a sequence of based CW-complexes over Q and obtain similar results for these spaces as we do for ᐆ Q .Using this general construction, we can compute the equivariant cohomology ring of ᐆ Q with respect to its canonical torus action from the Davis-Januszkiewicz space of Q.The result leads to the definition of a new notion called the topological face ring of Q, which generalizes the notion of face ring of a simple polytope.Moreover, the topological face ring of Q computes the equivariant cohomology of all locally standard torus actions with Q as the orbit space when the corresponding principal torus bundle over Q is trivial.Meanwhile, we obtain some parallel results for the real moment-angle manifold Rᐆ Q over Q as well.",

The knot invariants generalize the cyclic (type 1) invariants of Kirk and Livingston and when taken with respect to certain preferred knots, called spherical knots, relative self-linking numbers are characterized geometrically as the complete obstruction to the existence of a singular concordance which has all singularities paired by Whitney disks. This geometric equivalence relation, called W-equivalence, is also related finite type-1 equivalence (in the sense of Habiro and Goussarov) via the work of Conant and Teichner and represents a `first order' improvement to an arbitrary singular concordance. For null-homotopic knots, a slightly weaker geometric equivalence relation is shown to admit a group structure.",

The idea is that the colored Jones function of a knot satisfies a non-trivial linear q-difference equation. Said differently, the colored Jones function of a knot is annihilated by a non-zero ideal of the Weyl algebra which is generalted (after localization) by the non-commutative A-polynomial of a knot. In that paper, it was conjectured that this polynomial (which has to do with representations of the quantum group U_q(SL_2)) specializes at q=1 to the better known A-polynomial of a knot, which has to do with genuine SL_2(C) representations of the knot complement. Computing the non-commutative A-polynomial of a knot is a difficult task which so far has been achieved for the two simplest knots. In the present paper, we introduce the C-polynomial of a knot, along with its non-commutative version, and give an explicit computation for all twist knots. In a forthcoming paper, we will use this information to compute the non-commutative A-polynomial of twist knots. Finally, we formulate a number of conjectures relating the A, the C-polynomial and the Alexander polynomial, all confirmed for the class of twist knots.",

In particular, this article provides an algebraic version of the graphical clover calculus developed by Garoufalidis, Goussarov, Habiro and Polyak.

We introduce a notion of topological Azumaya algebra and show that in the case when the ground S-algebra R is an Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum of a commutative ring this notion specializes to classical Azumaya algebras.A canonical example of a topological Azumaya R-algebra is the endomorphism R-algebra F R (M, M ) of a finite cell R-module.We show that the spectrum of mod 2 topological Ktheory KU/2 is a nontrivial topological Azumaya algebra over the 2-adic completion of the K -theory spectrum KU 2 .This leads to the determination of THH(KU/2, KU/2), the topological Hochschild cohomology of KU/2.As far as we know this is the first calculation of THH(A, A) for a noncommutative S-algebra A.",

We show that there are Dyer-Lashof operations beta^epsilon Q^i acting on this algebra spectral sequence, and that its differentials are completely determined by those originating on the vertical axis. More surprisingly, we show that for each class x in the $^{2r}-term of the spectral sequence there are 2r other classes in the E^{2r}-term (obtained mostly by Dyer-Lashof operations on x) that are infinite cycles, i.e., survive to the E^infty-term. We apply this to completely determine the differentials in the homological homotopy fixed point spectral sequences for the topological Hochschild homology spectra R = THH(B) of many S-algebras, including B = MU, BP, ku, ko and tmf. Similar results apply for all finite subgroups C of T, and for the Tate- and homotopy orbit spectral sequences.

These symplectic invariants include spectral invariants, boundary depth, and (partial) symplectic quasi-states. This paper can split into two parts. In the first part, we prove some energy estimations that control the shifts of symplectic action functionals. These directly imply positive conclusions on the continuity of spectral invariants and boundary depth, in some important cases including any symplectic surface $\\Sigma_{g \\geq1}$ and any closed symplectic manifold $M$ with $\\dim_{\\mathcal K} H^2(M; \\mathcal K) = 1$. This follows by applications on some rigidity of the subsets of a symplectic manifold in terms of heaviness and superheaviness, as well as on the continuity property of some symplectic capacities. In the second part, we generalize the construction in the first part to any closed symplectic manifold. In particular, to deal with the change of Novikov rings from symplectic structure perturbations, we construct a family of variant Floer chain complexes over a common Novikov-type ring. In this set-up, we define a new family of spectral invariants called $t$-spectral invariants, and prove that they are upper semicontinuous under the symplectic structure perturbations. This implies a quasi-isometric embedding from $(\\mathbb R^{\\infty}, |-|_{\\infty})$ to $({\\widetilde {\\rm Ham}}(M, \\omega), |-|_{\\rm Hofer})$ under some dynamical assumption, imitating a result from Usher.",

A group is a diagram group if it is the fundamental group of a Squier complex. In this paper, we describe hyperplanes in these cube complexes. As a first application, we determine exactly when $S(\\mathcal{P},w)$ is a special cube complex, as defined by Haglund and Wise, so that the associated diagram group embeds into a right-angled Artin group. A particular feature of Squier complexes is that the intersections of hyperplanes are \"ordered\" by a relation $\\prec$. As a strong consequence on the geometry of $S(\\mathcal{P},w)$, we deduce, in finite dimensions, that its univeral cover isometrically embedds into a product of finitely-many trees with respect to the combinatorial metrics; in particular, we notice that (often) this allows to embed quasi-isometrically the associated diagram group into a product of finitely-many trees. Finally, we exhibit a class of hyperplanes inducing a decomposition of $S(\\mathcal{P},w)$ as a graph of spaces, and a fortiori a decomposition of the associated diagram group as a graph of groups, giving a new method to compute presentations of diagram groups. As an application, we associate a semigroup presentation $\\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma)$ to any finite interval graph $\\Gamma$, and we prove that the diagram group associated to $\\mathcal{P}(\\Gamma)$ (for a given base word) is isomorphic to the right-angled Artin group $A(\\overline{\\Gamma})$.",

This is in high contrast with the known situation for (usual) real projective spaces for which, in fact, the Euclidean immersion dimension and TC are two facets of the same problem. Low TC-values have been observed for infinite families of non-simply connected spaces only for H-spaces, for finite complexes whose fundamental group has cohomological dimension not exceeding 2, and now in this work for infinite families of PPS's. We discuss general bounds for the TC (and the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category) of PPS's, and compute these invariants for specific families of such manifolds. Some of our methods involve the use of an equivariant version of TC. We also give a characterization of the Euclidean immersion dimension of PPS's through generalized concepts of axial maps and, alternatively, non-singular maps.

In this paper, we generalize checkerboard surfaces to certain immersed surfaces, called twisted checkerboard surfaces, whose geometry better reflects that of the alternating link in many cases.

All these invariants are based on representation theory of the quantum group Uqsl2, where the definition of the invariants N_r and N^0_r uses a non-standard category of Uqsl2-modules which is not semi-simple. In this paper we study the second invariant N^0_r and consider its relationship with the WRT invariants. In particular, we show that the ADO invariant of a knot in S^3 is a meromorphic function of its color and we provide a strong relation between its residues and the colored Jones polynomials of the knot. Then we conjecture a similar relation between N^0_r and a WRT invariant. We prove this conjecture when the 3-manifold M is not a rational homology sphere and when M is a rational homology sphere obtained by surgery on a knot in S^3 or when M is a connected sum of such manifolds.",

Here we consider knots in thickened surfaces $\\Sigma \\times [0,1]$, where $\\Sigma$ is closed and oriented. We construct new concordance invariants by adapting the Chen-Milnor theory of links in $S^3$ to an extension of the group of a virtual knot. A key ingredient is the Bar-Natan $\\textit{Zh}$ map, which allows for a geometric interpretation of the group extension. The group extension itself was originally defined by Silver-Williams. Our extended $\\bar{\\mu}$-invariants obstruct concordance to homologically trivial knots in thickened surfaces. We use them to give new examples of non-slice virtual knots having trivial Rasmussen invariant, graded genus, affine index (or writhe) polynomial, and generalized Alexander polynomial. Furthermore, we complete the slice status classification of all virtual knots up to five classical crossings and reduce to four (out of 92800) the number of virtual knots up to six classical crossings having unknown slice status. Our main application is to Turaev's concordance group $\\mathscr{VC}$ of long knots on surfaces. Boden and Nagel proved that the concordance group $\\mathscr{C}$ of classical knots in $S^3$ embeds into the center of $\\mathscr{VC}$. In contrast to the classical knot concordance group, we show $\\mathscr{VC}$ is not abelian; answering a question posed by Turaev.",

We fill this gap by deducing simple skein relations for link-homotopy mu-invariants of string links.",

To do this, we define the notion of a grid diagram representing a transverse spatial graph, which we call a graph grid diagram. We prove that two graph grid diagrams representing the same transverse spatial graph are related by a sequence of graph grid moves, generalizing the work of Cromwell for links. For a graph grid diagram representing a transverse spatial graph $f:G \\rightarrow S^3$, we define a relatively bigraded chain complex (which is a module over a multivariable polynomial ring) and show that its homology is preserved under the graph grid moves; hence it is an invariant of the transverse spatial graph. In fact, we define both a minus and hat version. Taking the graded Euler characteristic of the homology of the hat version gives an Alexander type polynomial for the transverse spatial graph. Specifically, for each transverse spatial graph $f$, we define a balanced sutured manifold $(S^3\\smallsetminus f(G), \\gamma(f))$. We show that the graded Euler characteristic is the same as the torsion of $(S^3\\smallsetminus f(G), \\gamma(f))$ defined by S. Friedl, A. Juh\\'{a}sz, and J. Rasmussen.

We conjecture that this coarse assembly map is an isomorphism for uniformly contractible spaces with bounded geometry, and show that the coarse isomorphism conjecture, along with some mild technical conditions, implies that a correspoding equivariant assembly map is injective. Particular instances of this equivariant assembly map are the maps in the Farrell-Jones conjecture, and in the Baum-Connes conjecture.",

    "abstract": "Paper written in French -- English abstract: This paper proves a particular case of a conjecture of N. Kuhn. This conjecture is as follows. Consider the Gabriel-Krull filtration of the category U of unstable modules. Let U_n, n>=0, be the n-th step of this filtration. The category U is the smallest thick sub-category that contains all sub-categories U_n and is stable under colimit [L. Schwartz, Unstable modules over the Steenrod algebra and Sullivan's fixed point set conjecture, Chicago Lectures in Mathematics Series (1994)]. The category U_0 is the one of locally finite modules, i.e. the modules that are direct limit of finite modules. The conjecture is as follows, let X be a space then : * either H^*X is locally finite, * or H^*X does not belong to U_n, for all n. As an example the cohomology of a finite space, or of the loop space of a finite space are always locally finite. On the other side the cohomology of the classifying space of a finite group whose order is divisible by 2 does belong to any sub-category U_n. One proves this conjecture, modulo the additional hypothesis that all quotients of the nilpotent filtration are finitely generated. This condition is used when applying N. Kuhn's reduction of the problem. It is necessary to do it to be allowed to apply Lannes' theorem on the cohomology of mapping spaces.[N. Kuhn, On topologically realizing modules over the Steenrod algebra, Ann. of Math. 141 (1995) 321-347].",

Lackenby showed that the quantum SU(2) invariants are well-behaved under this congruence. We strengthen this result and extend it to the SO(3) quantum invariants. We also obtain some corresponding results for the coarser equivalence relations, and for quantum invariants associated to more general modular categories. We compare S^3, the Poincare homology sphere, the Brieskorn homology sphere Sigma(2,3,7) and their mirror images up to strong f-congruence.

We also show that the quasi-axis of a pseudo-Anosov element of the mapping class group may not have the strong contractibility property. Specifically, we show that, after choosing a generating set carefully, one can find a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism f, a sequence of points w_k and a sequence of radii r_k so that the ball B(w_k, r_k) is disjoint from a quasi-axis a of f, but for any projection map from mapping class group to a, the diameter of the image of B(w_k, r_k) grows like log(r_k).",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a class of closed orientable 3-manifolds constructed from a gluing of three handlebodies, such that the inclusion of each handlebody is 1injective.This construction is the generalisation to handlebodies of the construction for gluing three solid tori to produce non-Haken Seifert fibred 3-manifolds with infinite fundamental group.It is shown that there is an efficient algorithm to decide if a gluing of handlebodies satisfies the disk-condition.Also, an outline for the construction of the characteristic variety (JSJ decomposition) in such manifolds is given.Some non-Haken and atoroidal examples are given. 57N10, 57M10, 57M50 1 IntroductionThis paper is concerned with the class of 3-manifolds that meet the disk-condition.These are closed orientable 3-manifolds constructed from the gluing of three handlebodies, such that the induced map on the fundamental group of each of the handlebodies is injective.Thus all manifolds that meet the disk-condition have infinite fundamental group.The disk-condition is an extension to handlebodies of conditions for the gluing of three solid tori to produce non-Haken Seifert fibred manifolds with infinite fundamental group.These manifolds appear to have many nice properties.In this paper, some tools for understanding manifolds that meet the disk-condition are investigated.A number of constructions are given for this class, including some manifolds that are non-Haken and some that are atoroidal.The characteristic variety of manifolds that meet the disk-condition is also investigated.It is shown that the handlebody structure carries all the information for building the characteristic variety.In Section 2, standard definitions that are used throughout this paper are given.Also, the \"disk-condition\" is defined and discussed.In particular, it is shown how this condition is a generalisation of the construction of non-Haken Seifert fibred manifolds with infinite fundamental group.We also discuss how, on an intuitive level, the class of manifolds that meet the disk-condition contains many other non-Haken examples.",

This note explains how to define the virtual fundamental class of $X$ by representing $X$ via the zero set of a map $S_M: M\\to E$, where $E$ is a finite dimensional vector space and the domain $M$ is an oriented, weighted branched topological manifold. Moreover, $S_M$ is equivariant under the action of the global isotropy group $\\Gamma$ on $M$ and $E$. This tuple $(M,E, \\Gamma, S_M)$ together with a homeomorphism $S_M^{-1}(0)/\\Gamma \\to X$ forms a single finite dimensional model (or chart) for $X$. The construction assumes only that the atlas satisfies a topological version of the index condition that can be obtained from a standard, rather than a smooth, gluing theorem. However if $X$ is presented as the zero set of an sc-Fredholm operator on a strong polyfold bundle, we outline a much more direct construction of the branched manifold $M$ that uses an sc-smooth partition of unity.",

    "abstract": "A fibration of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ by oriented lines is given by a unit vector field $V : \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to S^2$, for which all of the integral curves are oriented lines. A line fibration is called skew if no two fibers are parallel. Skew fibrations have been the focus of recent study, in part due to their close relationships with great circle fibrations of $S^3$ and with tight contact structures on $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Both geometric and topological classifications of the space of skew fibrations have appeared; these classifications rely on certain rigid geometric properties exhibited by skew fibrations. Here we study these properties for line fibrations which are not necessarily skew, and we offer some partial answers to the question: in what sense do nonskew fibrations look and behave like skew fibrations? We develop and utilize a technique, called the parallel plane pushoff, for studying nonskew fibrations. In addition, we summarize the known relationship between line fibrations and contact structures, and we extend these results to give a complete correspondence. Finally, we develop a technique for generating nonskew fibrations and offer a number of examples.",

Concepts from homological algebra have not been used in this construction although it is an obvious question how they should enter in the non-semisimple case. In the present paper, we elucidate the interplay between the structures from topological field theory and from homological algebra by constructing a homotopy coherent projective action of the mapping class group $\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ of the torus on the Hochschild complex of a modular category. This is a further step towards understanding the Hochschild complex of a modular category as a differential graded conformal block for the torus.

The proof requires study of cosmetic surgery on links (equivalently, fillings of manifolds with boundary tori). There is no bound on the number of components of the link (or boundary components). For statements, see the second part of the introduction. Here are two examples of the results we obtain: 1) Let K be a component of a link L in S^3. Then \"most\" slopes on K cannot be completed to a cosmetic surgery on L, unless K becomes a component of a Hopf link. 2) Let X be a manifold and \\epsilon>0. Then all but finitely many hyperbolic manifolds obtained by filling X admit a geodesic shorter than \\epsilon\\ (note that this finite set may correspond to an infinitely many fillings).",

We drop the pro-monomorphic hypothesis and simply assume that the Z-action is generated by what we call a \"coaxial\" homeomorphism. In the pro-monomorphic case every proper Z-action is generated by a coaxial homeomorphism, but coaxials occur in far greater generality (often embedded in a cocompact action). When the generator is coaxial, we obtain the sharp conclusion: Y is proper 2-equivalent to the product of a locally finite tree with a line.

Our approach interprets the stabilization as a probabilistic phenomenon based on the asymptotic independence of certain *motivic random variables*, and gives explicit universal formulas for the limits in terms of the exponents of a motivic Euler product for the Kapranov zeta function. The result can be thought of as a weak but explicit version of representation stability for the cohomology of ordered configuration spaces. In the sequel we find similar stability results in spaces of smooth hypersurface sections, providing new examples to be investigated through the lens of representation stability for symmetric, symplectic and orthogonal groups.",

We then prove a result in symplectic geometry: These methods are applicable to the group of Liouville automorphisms of a Liouville sector.

A subset $S$ of a free group $F_N$ is called \\emph{spectrally rigid} if, whenever $T,T'\\in cv_N$ are such that $||g||_T=||g||_{T'}$ for every $g\\in S$ then $T=T'$ in $cv_N$. By contrast to the similar questions for the Teichm\\\"uller space, it is known that for $N\\ge 2$ there does not exist a finite spectrally rigid subset of $F_N$. In this paper we prove that for $N\\ge 3$ if $H\\le Aut(F_N)$ is a subgroup that projects to an infinite normal subgroup in $Out(F_N)$ then the $H$-orbit of an arbitrary nontrivial element $g\\in F_N$ is spectrally rigid. We also establish a similar statement for $F_2=F(a,b)$, provided that $g\\in F_2$ is not conjugate to a power of $[a,b]$. We also include an appended corrigendum which gives a corrected proof of Lemma 5.1 about the existence of a fully irreducible element in an infinite normal subgroup of of $Out(F_N)$. Our original proof of Lemma 5.1 relied on a subgroup classification result of Handel-Mosher, originally stated by Handel-Mosher for arbitrary subgroups $H\\le Out(F_N)$. After our paper was published, it turned out that the proof of the Handel-Mosher subgroup classification theorem needs the assumption that $H$ be finitely generated. The corrigendum provides an alternative proof of Lemma~5.1 which uses the corrected, finitely generated, version of the Handel-Mosher theorem and relies on the 0-acylindricity of the action of $Out(F_N)$ on the free factor complex (due to Bestvina-Mann-Reynolds).

On the other hand, we give examples of rank-2k bundles over 2k-dimensional spaces, including the tangent bundles of some 2k-manifolds, which are turnable but do not admit a complex structure.Hence turned bundles can be viewed as generalisations of complex bundles.We also generalise the definition of turning to other settings, including other paths of automorphisms, and we relate the generalised turnability of vector bundles to the topology of their gauge groups and the computation of certain Samelson products.",

The input of the invariant is a finite dimensional unimodular ribbon Hopf algebra A and an element in a quotient of its center, which determines a trace function on A. We study the subset T^4 of trace elements which define invariants of 4-thickenings under 2-deformations. In T^4 two subsets are identified : T^3, which produces invariants of 4-thickenings normalizable to invariants of the boundary, and T^2, which produces invariants of 4-thickenings depending only on the 2-dimensional spine and the second Whitney number of the 4-thickening. The case of the quantum sl(2) is studied in details. We conjecture that sl(2) leads to four HKR-type invariants and describe the corresponding trace elements. Moreover, the fusion algebra of the semisimple quotient of the category of representations of the quantum sl(2) is identified as a subalgebra of a quotient of its center.",

We show that this upper bound can be improved by 1 for a broad class of large manifolds.",

The Dehn twist along every simple closed curve $\\gamma \\subset \\Sigma$ induces an automorphism of the fundamental group $\\pi$ of $\\Sigma$. There are two possible ways to generalize such automorphisms if the curve $\\gamma$ is allowed to have self-intersections. One way is to consider the `generalized Dehn twist' along $\\gamma$: an automorphism of the Malcev completion of $\\pi$ whose definition involves intersection operations and only depends on the homotopy class $[\\gamma]\\in \\pi$ of $\\gamma$. Another way is to choose in the usual cylinder $U:=\\Sigma \\times [-1,+1]$ a knot $L$ projecting onto $\\gamma$, to perform a surgery along $L$ so as to get a homology cylinder $U_L$, and let $U_L$ act on every nilpotent quotient $\\pi/\\Gamma_{j} \\pi$ of $\\pi$ (where $\\Gamma_j\\pi$ denotes the subgroup of $\\pi$ generated by commutators of length $j$). In this paper, assuming that $[\\gamma]$ is in $\\Gamma_k \\pi$ for some $k\\geq 2$, we prove that (whatever the choice of $L$ is) the automorphism of $\\pi/\\Gamma_{2k+1} \\pi$ induced by $U_L$ agrees with the generalized Dehn twist along $\\gamma$ and we explicitly compute this automorphism in terms of $[\\gamma]$ modulo ${\\Gamma_{k+2}}\\pi$. As applications, we obtain new formulas for certain evaluations of the Johnson homomorphisms showing, in particular, how to realize any element of their targets by some explicit homology cylinders and/or generalized Dehn twists.",

    "abstract": "We develop an alternative to the May-Thomason construction used to compare operad based infinite loop machines to that of Segal, which relies on weak products. Our construction has the advantage that it can be carried out in $Cat$, whereas their construction gives rise to simplicial categories. As an application we show that a simplicial algebra over a $\\Sigma$-free $Cat$ operad $\\mathcal{O}$ is functorially weakly equivalent to a $Cat$ algebra over $\\mathcal{O}$. When combined with the results of a previous paper, this allows us to conclude that up to weak equivalences the category of $\\mathcal{O}$-categories is equivalent to the category of $B\\mathcal{O}$-spaces, where $B:Cat\\to Top$ is the classifying space functor. In particular, $n$-fold loop spaces (and more generally $E_n$ spaces) are functorially weakly equivalent to classifying spaces of $n$-fold monoidal categories. Another application is a change of operads construction within $Cat$.",

The procedure consists in gluing together some building blocks, called hyperbolic plugs, along their boundary in order to obtain a closed 3-manifold endowed with a complete flow. The main theorem of [5] states that (under some mild hypotheses) it is possible to choose the gluing maps so the resulting flow is Anosov. The aim of the present paper is to show a uniqueness result for Anosov flows obtained by such a procedure. Roughly speaking, we show that the orbital equivalence class of these Anosov flows is insensitive to the precise choice of the gluing maps used in the construction. The proof relies on a coding procedure which we find interesting for its own sake, and follows a strategy that was introduced by T. Barbot in a particular case.",

Our method is particularly useful for constructing “profinite” analogues of known model categories. Our construction quickly recovers Morel’s model structure for pro- p spaces and Quick’s model structure for profinite spaces, but we will show that it can also be applied to construct many interesting new model structures. In addition, we study some general properties of our method, such as its functorial behavior and its relation to Bousfield localization. We compare our construction to the ∞–categorical approach to ind- and pro-categories in an appendix.",

Consider a CW complex of the form X cup_{alpha}e^{k+1} and a space Y whose connectivity exceeds the dimension of the adjunction space. Using a Quillen-Sullivan mixed type model for a based mapping space, we prove that, if the bracket length of the attaching map alpha: S^k --&gt; X is greater than the Whitehead length WL(Y) of Y, then F_*(X cup_{alpha}e^{k+1}, Y) has the rational homotopy type of the product space F_*(X, Y) times Omega^{k+1}Y. This result yields that if the bracket lengths of all the attaching maps constructing a finite CW complex X are greater than WL(Y) and the connectivity of Y is greater than or equal to dim X, then the mapping space F_*(X, Y) can be decomposed rationally as the product of iterated loop spaces.",

They conjecture the existence of a solution corresponding to the geometric representation. In this paper, we show that a boundary-parabolic representation $ρ$ arises from a solution if and only if the length of $D$ modulo $2$ equals the obstruction to lifting $ρ$ to a boundary-parabolic $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$-representation (as an element in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$). In particular, the Hikami-Inoue conjecture holds if and only if the length of $D$ is odd. This can always be achieved by adding a kink to the braid if necessary.

If a single rod moves among N-fixed obstacles, the resulting fluid diffeomorphism is in the push-point mapping class associated with the loop in \\pi_1(D^2 - {N points}) traversed by the single stirrer. The collection of motions in each of which the stirrer goes around a single obstacle generate the group of push-point mapping classes, and the entropy efficiency with respect to these generators gives a topological measure of the mixing per unit energy expenditure of the mapping class. We give lower and upper bounds for Eff(N), the maximal efficiency in the presence of N obstacles, and prove that Eff(N) -> log(3) as N -> \\infty. For the lower bound we compute the entropy efficiency of a specific push-point protocol, HSP_N, which we conjecture achieves the maximum. The entropy computation uses the action on chains in a \\Z-covering space of the punctured disk which is designed for push-point protocols. For the upper bound we estimate the exponential growth rate of the action of the push-point mapping classes on the fundamental group of the punctured disk using a collection of incidence matrices and then computing the generalized spectral radius of the collection.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the spaces of q -tuples of points in a Euclidean space, without k -wise coincidences (configuration-like spaces).A transitive group action by permuting these points is considered, and some new upper bounds on the genus (in the sense of Krasnosel'skii-Schwarz and Clapp-Puppe) for this action are given.Some theorems of Cohen-Lusk type for coincidence points of continuous maps to Euclidean spaces are deduced.55R80; 55M20, 55M30, 55M35, 57S17 IntroductionIn this paper we address the question of finding some sufficient conditions that guarantee that a continuous map f W X !R m has a certain number of self-coincidences on an orbit of a G -action on X , where G is a finite group.The most famous result of this kind is the Borsuk-Ulam theorem [5], where X is the m-dimensional sphere and G D Z=2 acts on X by the antipodal action.Partial solutions of the Knaster problem by Makeev [18] and the second author [24] provide another application.In order to simplify the statements we need some definitions.Definition 1.1 Let G be a finite group, and X be a G -space, that is, a topological space with continuous left G -action.For a given continuous map f W X !Y we denote by A.f; k/ the coincidence set A.f; k/ D fx 2 X W 9 distinct g 1 ; : : : ; g k 2 G such that f .g 1 x/ D D f .gk x/g: Generally, to deduce existence theorems for coincidences, we have to define the complexity of the action of G on the space X .The following definition was made for G D Z=2 by Krasnosel'skii [15;17] and Yang [28; 29], and for arbitrary finite G by Krasnosel'skii in [16], as noted by Schwarz [20].It is usually called the Krasnosel'skii-Schwarz genus.",

In the first approach, a map is a weak equivalence if it induces an isomorphism on rational homology. In the second, a map of connected and pointed spaces is a weak equivalence if it induces an isomorphism between fundamental groups and higher rationalized homotopy groups; we call these maps $\\pi_1$-rational homotopy equivalences. In this paper, we compare these two notions and show that $\\pi_1$-rational homotopy equivalences correspond to maps that induce $\\Omega$-quasi-isomorphisms on the rational singular chains, i.e. maps that induce a quasi-isomorphism after applying the cobar functor to the dg coassociative coalgebra of rational singular chains. This implies that both notions of rational homotopy equivalence can be deduced from the rational singular chains by using different algebraic notions of weak equivalences: quasi-isomorphism and $\\Omega$-quasi-isomorphisms. We further show that, in the second approach, there are no dg coalgebra models of the chains that are both strictly cocommutative and coassociative.",

It is also related to the Morse theory of closed 1-forms. Given a controlled 0-connected cohomology class on a manifold M with n = dim M > 4 we can realize it by a closed 1-form which is Morse without critical points of index 0, 1, n-1 and n. If n = dim M > 5 and the cohomology class is controlled 1-connected we can approximately realize any chain complex D_* with the simple homotopy type of the Novikov complex and with D_i=0 for i < 2 and i > n-2 as the Novikov complex of a closed 1-form. This reduces the problem of finding a closed 1-form with a minimal number of critical points to a purely algebraic problem.",

A simple question to ponder is whether a mapping class of S can be determined to be pseudo-Anosov given only the data of its action on Gamma/Gamma_k for some k. In this paper, to each mapping class f which acts trivially on Gamma/Gamma_{k+1}, we associate an invariant Psi_k(f) in End(H_1(S, Z)) which is constructed from its action on Gamma/Gamma_{k+2} . We show that if the characteristic polynomial of Psi_k(f) is irreducible over Z, then f must be pseudo-Anosov. Some explicit mapping classes are then shown to be pseudo-Anosov.",

Such a determinativeness by finite subobjects appears in the definition of a phantom map which is classical in algebraic topology. The topological method in combinatorics connects these two, which leads us to define the relative version of a phantom map: a map $f\\colon X\\to Y$ is called a relative phantom map to a map $\\varphi\\colon B\\to Y$ if the restriction of $f$ to any finite subcomplex of $X$ lifts to $B$ through $\\varphi$, up to homotopy. There are two kinds of maps which are obviously relative phantom maps: (1) the composite of a map $X\\to B$ with $\\varphi$; (2) a usual phantom map $X\\to Y$. A relative phantom map of type (1) is called trivial, and a relative phantom map out of a suspension which is a sum of (1) and (2) is called relatively trivial. We study the (relative) triviality of relative phantom maps and in particular, we give rational homology conditions for the (relative) triviality.",

Finally we consider the ideal points added after compactification of the character variety. We bound the vanishing order of the torsion by the Euler characteristic of an essential surface associated to the ideal point by the Culler-Shalen theory. As a corollary we obtain an unexpected relation between the topology of those surfaces and the topology of the character variety.",

Using this definition, the subset of braids that have a representative where a specified subset of these points remain pointwise fixed forms a subgroup isomorphic to a braid group with fewer strands. In this article, we generalize this phenomenon by introducing the notion of boundary braids. A boundary braid is a braid that has a representative where some specified subset of the points remains in the boundary cycle of the disk. Although boundary braids merely form a subgroupoid rather than a subgroup, they play an interesting geometric role in the piecewise Euclidean dual braid complex defined by Tom Brady and the second author. We prove several theorems in this setting, including the fact that the subcomplex of the dual braid complex determined by a specified set of boundary braids metrically splits as the direct metric product of a Euclidean polyhedron and a dual braid complex of smaller rank.",

In addition, we characterize strongly contracting quasi-geodesics in Teichm\\uller space, generalizing results of Brock-Masur-Minsky.

If the domain and the target manifold have the same dimension (e.g. in the fixed point setting) all these Nielsen numbers agree with the classical definition. However, in general they can be quite distinct. While our approach is very geometric the computations use the techniques of homotopy theory and, in particular, all versions of Hopf invariants (a la Ganea, Hilton, James..).

To solve this problem, we develop the Koszul duality theory of operads in the category of modules over a cocommutative Hopf algebra. This gives rise to a simpler category of homotopy algebras and infinity-morphisms, which allows us to get a new description of the homotopy category of algebras over such operads. The main example of this theory is given by Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras.",

We investigate in detail the (Atiyah-Patodi-Singer)-rho-invariant for manifolds with boundary. First we generalize the cut-and-paste formula to arbitrary boundary conditions. A priori the rho-invariant is an invariant of the Riemannian structure and a representation of the fundamental group. We show, however, that the dependence on the metric is only very mild: it is independent of the metric in the interior and the dependence on the metric on the boundary is only up to its pseudo--isotopy class. Furthermore, we show that this cannot be improved: we give explicit examples and a theoretical argument that different metrics on the boundary in general give rise to different rho-invariants. Theoretically, this follows from an interpretation of the exponentiated rho-invariant as a covariantly constant section of a determinant bundle over a certain moduli space of flat connections and Riemannian metrics on the boundary. Finally we extend to manifolds with boundary the results of Farber-Levine-Weinberger concerning the homotopy invariance of the rho-invariant and spectral flow of the odd signature operator.",

To characterize these spaces, we describe all possible Hecke modifications of all possible rank 2 vector bundles over $X$, and we use these results to define a canonical open embedding of $\\mathcal{P}_M(X,m,n)$ into $M^s(X,m+n)$, the moduli space of stable rank 2 parabolic bundles over $X$ with trivial determinant bundle and $m+n$ marked points. We explicitly compute $\\mathcal{P}_M(X,1,n)$ for $n=0,1,2$. For comparison, we present analogous results for the case of rational curves, for which a corresponding complex manifold $\\mathcal{P}_M(\\mathbb{CP}^1,3,n)$ is isomorphic for $n$ even to a space $\\mathcal{Y}(S^2,n)$ defined by Seidel and Smith that can be used to compute the symplectic Khovanov homology of $n$-stranded links in $S^3$.",

In this paper, we study the cotangent complex of the derived $G$-representation scheme $ {\\rm DRep}_G(X)$ of a pointed connected topological space $X$. We use an (algebraic version of) unstable Adams spectral sequence relating the cotangent homology of $ {\\rm DRep}_G(X) $ to the representation homology $ {\\rm HR}_*(X,G) := \\pi_*{\\mathcal O}[{\\rm DRep}_G(X)] $ to prove some vanishing theorems for groups and geometrically interesting spaces. Our examples include virtually free groups, Riemann surfaces, link complements in $ {\\mathbb R}^3 $ and generalized lens spaces. In particular, for any f.g. virtually free group $ \\Gamma $, we show that $\\, {\\rm HR}_i({\\rm B}\\Gamma, G) = 0 \\,$ for all $ i > 0 $.

We prove these bounds locally on the smooth locus of the representation scheme $ {\\rm Rep}_G[\\pi_1(\\Sigma_g)]\\,$ in the case of complex connected reductive groups. One important consequence of our results is the existence of a well-defined $K$-theoretic virtual fundamental class for $ {\\rm DRep}_G(X)$ in the sense of Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov.

In particular, H_1 of this Abel map is an isomorphism. In proving this result, we prove some results about Picbar that are of independent interest. The singular curve X/\\partial X has a unique singularity that is an ordinary fold point, and we describe the compactified Picard scheme of such a curve up to universal homeomorphism using a presentation scheme. We construct a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for certain push-outs of schemes, and an isomorphism of functors \\pi_1^{ell} Pic^0(-) = H^1(-,Z_ell(1)).",

The growth series of $G$ with respect to $x$ is then defined to be the power series $G_x(t)=\\sum_g t^{|g|}$ where $|g|$ denotes the length of $g$. Using the fact that $G$ admits a suitable automatic structure, $G_x(t)$ can be shown to be a rational function. We prove that if $Y$ is a manifold of dimension $n$, then this rational function satisfies the reciprocity formula $G_x(t^{-1})=(-1)^n G_x(t)$.

When $C_*$ has cyclic $C_\\infty$ coalgebra structure, we describe an $A_\\infty$ algebra on $C_* \\otimes H_*$. This is used to give an explicit (non-minimal) $A_\\infty$ algebra model of the string topology loop product. Finally, we discuss a representation of the loop product in principal $G$-bundles.",

The decategorification of HOMFLY-PT homology for general link diagrams gives a deformed version of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial, $P^{b}(D)$, which can be used to detect nonbraidlike isotopies.

If H 1 (E) = 0 then E, under the induced path metric, is a complete CAT(κ) space.(Throughout this paper, we assume κ ≤ 0.) We remark that another potential route to prove Theorem A is to solve the isoperimetric inequality for simple closed curves [2].Unfortunately, it is not clear how to do this; in particular, the behavior of simple closed curves can be rather subtle in a CAT(κ) 2-complex (see Example 1.4 below, for instance), and there is no general 1-Lipschitz retraction from the full 2-complex to a closed subset, even if the subset is contractible.The paper proceeds as follows: We first generalize some aspects of the Jordan Curve Theorem to the context of CAT(κ) 2-complexes (Theorem 2.8).This allows us to make assertions about the behavior of curves in Y at the points where they are locally geodesic (Lemma 3.4).Finally, we reduce the theorem to the case where X is planar, and use a characterization of angles proved in [3, Theorem B].",

As a consequence of Levine's work, one obtains then well defined categories of mixed Tate motives over the moduli spaces of curves . It is shown that morphisms between moduli spaces forgetting marked points and embedding as boundary components induce functors between those categories and how tangential bases points fit in these functorialities. Tannakian formalism attaches groups to these categories and morphisms reflecting the functorialities leading to the definition of a motivic Grothendieck-Teichm{\\\"u}ller group. Proofs of the above properties rely on the geometry of the tower of the moduli spaces . This allows us to treat the general case of motives over Spec(Z) with integral coefficients working in Spitzweck's category of motives.

Finally, we run the associated descent spectral sequence to compute the $V(1)$-homotopy groups of the homotopy fixed-points of this action; one consequence is that, for each element in the $K(2)$-local homotopy groups of the Smith-Toda complex $V(1)$, either that element or its dual is detected in the Galois cohomology of the abelian closure of some quadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$.",

The nonzero topological Hochschild homology groups of a number ring V are, where D V is the different ideal.There are many descriptions of the different ideal, but in the case that V is of the form Z[x]/f (x) for some monic polynomial f with integer coefficients, D V is the ideal in V generated by the derivative f ′ (x) and particularly if V = Z, D V = Z as well.Note that being a maximal order in B does not uniquely determine U , even up to isomorphism.The homotopy groups we get in our calculation of THH * (U ) will, however, be isomorphic for all the maximal orders U in a fixed B-see Remark 6.2 below.The maximal order U is said to be ramified at a prime ideal P of its center V if the degree e P of the division algebra D P over its center is greater than one.Note that if U is unramified at P, B ∧ P is isomorphic to the ring of i × i matrices over C ∧ P for some positive integer i, and then the same must be true for their valuation rings U ∧ P and V ∧ P by [12, Theorem X.1].Then by Morita equivalence [2, Proposition 3.9], THH(U ∧ P ) ≃ THH(M i (V ∧ P )) ≃ THH(V ∧ P ), which is reflected in the fact that there is no P-torsion in even dimensions in the result of Theorem 6.1.In even dimensions, we get that THH 2a (U ) ∼ = HH 2a (U ), which was calculated by Michael Larsen in [6] and is given in Equation (2.9) below.However, the linearization map THH * (U ) → HH * (U ) induced by sending (HU ) ∧(ℓ+1) to its components",

Painted trees were introduced recently as examples of how graded Hopf operads can bequeath Hopf structures upon compositions of coalgebras. We put these trees in context by exhibiting them as the minimal elements of face posets of certain convex polytopes. The full face posets themselves often possess the structure of graded Hopf algebras (with one-sided unit). We can enumerate faces using the fact that they are structure types of substitutions of combinatorial species. Species considered here include ordered and unordered binary trees and ordered lists (labeled corollas). Some of the polytopes that constitute our main results are well known in other contexts. First we see the classical permutohedra, and then certain generalized permutohedra: specifically the graph associahedra of suspensions of certain simple graphs. As an aside we show that the stellohedra also appear as liftings of generalized permutohedra: graph composihedra for complete graphs. Thus our results give examples of Hopf algebras of tubings and marked tubings of graphs. We also show an alternative associative algebra structure on the graph tubings of star graphs.",

We prove that Ꮿ.L/ is isomorphic to the Whitehead crossed module associated to the simplicial pair .hLi;hL 0 i/.Our main result is the identification of hLi with the classifying space of Ꮿ.L/. 17B55, 55P62; 55U101 Background on Lie models A complete differential graded Lie algebra (henceforth cdgl) is a differential graded Lie algebra L equipped with a decreasing filtration of differential Lie ideals such that F 1 D L, OEF p L; F q L F pCq L and L D lim n L=F n L:If no filtration is specified, it is understood that we consider the lower central series.",

    "abstract": "There are several knot invariants in the literature that are defined using singular instantons. Such invariants provide strong tools to study the knot group and give topological applications. For instance, it gives powerful tools to study the topology of knots in terms of representations of fundamental groups. In particular, it is shown that any traceless representation of the torus knot group can be extended to any concordance from the torus knot to another knot. Daemi and Scaduto proposed a generalization that is related to a version of the Slice-Ribbon conjecture to torus knots. The results of this paper provide further evidence towards the positive answer to this question. The method is a generalization of Daemi-Scaduto's equivariant singular instanton Floer theory following Echeverria's earlier work. Moreover, the irreducible singular instanton homology of torus knots for all but finitely many rational holonomy parameters are determined as $\\mathbb{Z}/4$-graded abelian groups.",

    "abstract": "We define a new family of graph invariants, studying the topology of the moduli space of their geometric realizations in Euclidean spaces, using a limiting procedure reminiscent of Floer homology.Given a labeled graph G on n vertices and d ≥ 1, W G,d ⊆ R d×n denotes the space of nondegenerate realizations of G in R d .For example if G is the empty graph then W G,d is homotopy equivalent to the configuration space of n points in R d .Questions about when a certain graph G exists as a geometric in R d have been considered in the literature and in our notation have to do with deciding when W G,d is nonempty.However W G,d need not be connected, even when it is nonempty, and we refer to the connected components of W G,d as rigid isotopy classes of G in R d .We study the topology of these rigid isotopy classes.First, regarding the connectivity of W G,d , we generalize a result of Maehara that W G,d is nonempty for d ≥ n to show that W G,d is k-connected for d ≥ n + k + 1, and so WG,∞ is always contractible.While π k (W G,d ) = 0 for G, k fixed and d large enough, we also prove that, in spite of this, when d ∞ the structure of the nonvanishing homology of W G,d exhibits a stabilization phenomenon.The nonzero part of its homology is concentrated in at most (n -1)-many equally spaced clusters in degrees between dn and (n -1)(d -1), and whose structure does not depend on d, for d large enough.This leads to the definition of a family of graph invariants, capturing the asymptotic structure of the homology of the rigid isotopy class.For instance, the sum of the Betti numbers of W G,d does not depend on d, for d large enough; we call this number the Floer number of the graph G.This terminology comes by analogy with Floer theory, because of the shifting phenomenon in the degrees of positive Betti numbers of W G,d as d tends to infinity.Finally, we give asymptotic estimates on the number of rigid isotopy classes of R dgeometric graphs on n vertices for d fixed and n tending to infinity.When d = 1 we show that asymptotically as n ∞ each isomorphism class corresponds to a constant number of rigid isotopy classes, on average.For d > 1 we prove a similar statement at the logarithmic scale.",

A holonomic knot associated to a generic function is naturally framed by the blackboard framing of the knot diagram associated to the 1-jet extension of the function. There are two classical invariants of framed knot diagrams: the Whitney index (rotation number) W and the self linking number S. For a framed holonomic knot we show that W is bounded above by the negative of the braid index of the knot, and that the sum of W and |S| is bounded by the negative of the Euler characteristic of any Seifert surface of the knot. The invariant S restricted to framed holonomic knots with W=m, is proved to split into n, where n is the largest natural number with 2n &lt; |m|+1, integer invariants. Using this, the framed holonomic isotopy classification of framed holonomic knots is shown to be more refined than the regular isotopy classification of their diagrams.",

We apply this Chern character map to the Cech nerve of a good cover of a complex manifold and assemble the data by passing to the totalization to obtain a map of simplicial sets. In simplicial degree 0, this map gives a formula for the Chern character of a bundle in terms of the clutching functions. In simplicial degree 1, this map gives a formula for the Chern character of bundle maps. In each simplicial degree beyond 1, these invariants, defined in terms of the transition functions, govern the compatibilities between the invariants assigned in previous simplicial degrees. In addition to this, we also apply this Chern character to complex Lie groupoids to obtain invariants of bundles on them in terms of the simplicial data. For group actions, these invariants land in suitable complexes calculating various Hodge equivariant cohomologies. In contrast, the de Rham Chern character formula involves additional terms and will appear in a sequel paper. In a sense, these constructions build on a point of view of \"characteristic classes in terms of transition functions\" advocated by Raoul Bott, which has been addressed over the years in various forms and degrees, concerning the existence of formulae for the Hodge and de Rham characteristic classes of bundles solely in terms of their clutching functions.",

We show that, under mild hypothesis, their cusp area admits two sided bounds in terms of the twist number of the alternating projection and the genus of the projection surface. As a result, we derive diagrammatic estimates of slope lengths and give applications to Dehn surgery. These generalize results of Lackenby and Purcell about alternating knots in the 3-sphere. Using a result of Kalfagianni and Purcell, we point out that alternating knots on surfaces of higher genus, can have arbitrarily small cusp density, in contrast to alternating knots on spheres whose cusp densities are bounded away from zero due to Lackenby and Purcell.",

In this paper, for each of the successive quotients of the filtrations we give a new infinite rank subgroup which trivially intersects the previously known infinite rank subgroups. Instead of iterated doubling operators, the generating knots of these new subgroups are constructed using the notion of algebraic $n$-solutions, which was introduced by Cochran and Teichner. Moreover, for each slice knot $K$ whose Alexander polynomial has degree greater than 2, we construct the generating knots such that they have the same derived quotients and higher-order Alexander invariants up to a certain order. In the proof, we use an $L^2$-theoretic obstruction for a knot to being $n.5$-solvable given by Cha, which is based on $L^2$-theoretic techniques developed by Cha and Orr. We also generalize the notion of algebraic $n$-solutions to the notion of $R$-algebraic $n$-solutions where $R$ is either rationals or the field of $p$ elements for a prime $p$.",

Abstract (Comparison of the n-categorical nerves). -Our aim is to compare three nerve functors for strict n-categories: the Street nerve, the cellular nerve and the multi-simplicial nerve.We show that these three functors are equivalent in some appropriate sense.In particular, the classes of n-categorical weak equivalences that they define coincide: they are the Thomason equivalences.We give two applications of this result: the first one states that a Dyer-Kan-type equivalence for Thomason equivalences is a Thomason equivalence; the second one, fundamental, is the stability of the class of Thomason equivalences under the dualities of the category of strict n-categories.",

First, we show that for every closed Riemannian surface of genus $g \\geq 2$ and area normalized to $g$, there are at least $\\ceil{\\log(2g)+1}$ homotopically independent loops based at the same point of length at most $C\\log(g)$, where $C$ is a universal constant. On the one hand, this result substantially improves Theorem $5.4.A$ of M. Gromov in \\cite{G1}. On the other hand, it recaptures the result of S. Sabourau on the separating systole in \\cite{SS} and refines his proof. Second, we show that for any two integers $b\\geq 2$ with $1\\leq n\\leq b$, every connected metric graph $\\Gamma$ of first Betti number $b$ and of length $b$ contains at least $n$ homologically independent loops based at the same point and of length at most $24(\\log(b)+n)$. In particular, this result extends Bollob\\`as-Szemer\\'edi-Thomason's $\\log(b)$ bound on the homological systole to at least $\\log(b)$ homologically independent loops based at the same point. Moreover, we give examples of graphs where this result is optimal.",

In particular, switching $X$ with $Y$ induces a derived isomorphism between the generalized Khovanov homology of a link $L$ with its dual version, i.e. the homology of the mirror image $L^!$, and we compute an explicit formula for this map.

    "abstract": "How do Seifert surgeries on hyperbolic knots arise from those on torus knots?We approach this question from a networking viewpoint introduced in [9].The Seifert surgery network is a 1-dimensional complex whose vertices correspond to Seifert surgeries; two vertices are connected by an edge if one Seifert surgery is obtained from the other by a single twist along a trivial knot called a seiferter or along an annulus cobounded by seiferters.Successive twists along a \"hyperbolic seiferter\" or a \"hyperbolic annular pair\" produce infinitely many Seifert surgeries on hyperbolic knots.In this paper, we investigate Seifert surgeries on torus knots that have hyperbolic seiferters or hyperbolic annular pairs, and obtain results suggesting that such surgeries are restricted.57M25; 57M50, 57N10",

Algebra 246 (2001), 739--760] for odd primes p. It is proved that for certain irreducible representations L(lambda) of the full matrix semigroup M_n(F_p), the first occurrence of L(lambda) as a composition factor in the polynomial algebra P=F_p[x_1,...,x_n] is linked by a Steenrod operation to the first occurrence of L(lambda) as a submodule in P. This operation is given explicitly as the image of an admissible monomial in the Steenrod algebra A_p under the canonical anti-automorphism chi . The first occurrences of both kinds are also linked to higher degree occurrences of L(lambda) by elements of the Milnor basis of A_p.",

Namely, we study DGAs whose corresponding Eilenberg-Mac Lane ring spectrum is equivalent to $H\\mathbb{Z} \\wedge E$ for some ring spectrum $E$. We call these DGAs extension DGAs. We also define and study this notion for $E_\\infty$ DGAs. The topological Hochschild homology (THH) spectrum of an extension DGA splits in a convenient way. We show that formal DGAs with nice homology rings are extension and therefore their THH groups can be obtained from their Hochschild homology groups in many cases of interest. We also provide interesting examples of DGAs that are not extension. In the second part, we study properties of extension DGAs. We show that in various cases, topological equivalences and quasi-isomorphisms agree for extension DGAs. From this, we obtain that dg Morita equivalences and Morita equivalences also agree in these cases.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we give some conditions on the structure of an unstable module, which are satisfied whenever this module is the reduced cohomology of a space or a spectrum. First, we study the structure of the sub-modules of Sigma^sH^*(B(Z/2)^{oplus d};Z/2), i.e., the unstable modules whose nilpotent filtration has length 1. Next, we generalise this result to unstable modules whose nilpotent filtration has a finite length, and which verify an additional condition. The result says that under certain hypotheses, the reduced cohomology of a space or a spectrum does not have arbitrary large gaps in its structure. This result is obtained by applying Adams' theorem on the Hopf invariant and the classification of the injective unstable modules. This work was carried out under the direction of L. Schwartz. Resume Dans cet article, on donne des restrictions sur la structure d'un module instable, qui doivent etre verifiees pour que celui-ci soit la cohomologie reduite d'un espace ou d'un spectre. On commence par une etude sur la structure des sous-modules de Sigma^sH^*(B(Z/2)^{oplus d};Z/2), i.e., les modules instables dont la filtration nilpotente est de longueur 1. Ensuite, on generalise le resultat aux modules instables dont la filtration nilpotente est de longueur finie, et qui verifient une condition supplementaire. Le resultat dit que sous certaines hypotheses, la cohomologie reduite d'un espace ou d'un spectre ne contient pas de lacunes de longueur arbitrairement grande. Ce resultat est obtenu par application du celebre theoreme d'Adams sur l'invariant de Hopf et de la classification des modules instables injectifs. Ce travail est effectue sous la direction de L.

    "abstract": "The classical Hopf invariant is an invariant of homotopy classes of maps from $S^{4n-1} $ to $S^{2n}$, and is an important invariant in homotopy theory. The goal of this paper is to use the Koszul duality theory for $E_n$-operads to define a generalization of the classical Hopf invariant. One way of defining the classical Hopf invariant is by defining a pairing between the cohomology of the associative bar construction on the cochains of a space $X$ and the homotopy groups of $X$. In this paper we will give a generalization of the classical Hopf invariant by defining a pairing between the cohomology of the $E_n$-bar construction on the cochains of $X$ and the homotopy groups of $X$. This pairing gives us a set of invariants of homotopy classes of maps from $S^m$ to a simplicial set $X$, this pairing can detect more homotopy classes of maps than the classical Hopf invariant. The second part of the paper is devoted to combining the $E_n$-Hopf invariants with the Koszul duality theory for $E_n$-operads to get a relation between the $E_n$-Hopf invariants of a space $X$ and the $E_{n+1}$-Hopf invariants of the suspension of $X$. This is done by studying the suspension morphism for the $E_\\infty$-operad, which is a morphism from the $E_{\\infty}$-operad to the desuspension of the $E_\\infty$-operad. We show that it induces a functor from $E_\\infty$-algebras to $E_\\infty$-algebras, which has the property that it sends an $E_\\infty$-model for a simplicial set $X$ to an $E_\\infty$-model for the suspension of $X$. We use this result to give a relation between the $E_n$-Hopf invariants of maps from $S^m$ into $X$ and the $E_{n+1}$-Hopf invariants of maps from $S^{m+1}$ into the suspension of $X$. One of the main results we show here, is that this relation can be used to define invariants of stable homotopy classes of maps.",

These inequalities can be deduced through a purely analytic method by studying the asymptotic behaviour of the deformed Laplacian operator. This method was introduced by E. Witten and has inspired a numbers of great achievements in Geometry and Topology in few past decades.

These are topological invariants of balanced sutured 3-manifolds endowed with a homomorphism of the fundamental group into $\\text{Aut}(H)$ and possibly with a $\\text{Spin}^c$ structure and a homology orientation.

Nonetheless, we show that the exponential growth rate of the colored Jones polynomials of the figure eight knot with s close to 1/2 is strictly less than those with s close to 1.It is known that the Turaev Viro invariant of the figure eight knot can be expressed in terms of a sum of its colored Jones polynomials.Our results show that this sum is asymptotically equal to the sum of the terms with s close to 1.As an application of the asymptotic behavior of the colored Jones polynomials, we obtain the asymptotic expansion formula for the Turaev-Viro invariants of the figure eight knot.Finally, we suggest a possible generalization of our approach so as to relate the AEF for the colored Jones polynomials and the AEF for the Turaev-Viro invariants for general hyperbolic knots.",

For this we establish the foundations of $M$-equivariant homotopy theory where $M$ is a discrete monoid. For projective $M$-CW complexes we prove several fundamental results such as the homotopy extension and lifting property, which we use to prove the $M$-equivariant Whitehead theorems. We define a left equivariant classifying space as a contractible projective $M$-CW complex. We prove that such a space is unique up to $M$-homotopy equivalence and give a canonical model for such a space via the nerve of the right Cayley graph category of the monoid. The topological finiteness conditions left-$\\mathrm{F}_n$ and left geometric dimension are then defined for monoids in terms of existence of a left equivariant classifying space satisfying appropriate finiteness properties. We also introduce the bilateral notion of $M$-equivariant classifying space, proving uniqueness and giving a canonical model via the nerve of the two-sided Cayley graph category, and we define the associated finiteness properties bi-$\\mathrm{F}_n$ and geometric dimension. We explore the connections between all of the these topological finiteness properties and several well-studied homological finiteness properties of monoids which are important in the theory of string rewriting systems, including $\\mathrm{FP}_n$, cohomological dimension, and Hochschild cohomological dimension. We also develop the corresponding theory of $M$-equivariant collapsing schemes (that is, $M$-equivariant discrete Morse theory), and among other things apply it to give topological proofs of results of Anick, Squier and Kobayashi that monoids which admit presentations by complete rewriting systems are left-, right- and bi-$\\mathrm{FP}_\\infty$.",
