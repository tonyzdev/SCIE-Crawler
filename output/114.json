    "abstract": "The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) contains a complete record of all published organic and metal–organic small-molecule crystal structures. The database has been in operation for over 50 years and continues to be the primary means of sharing structural chemistry data and knowledge across disciplines. As well as structures that are made public to support scientific articles, it includes many structures published directly as CSD Communications. All structures are processed both computationally and by expert structural chemistry editors prior to entering the database. A key component of this processing is the reliable association of the chemical identity of the structure studied with the experimental data. This important step helps ensure that data is widely discoverable and readily reusable. Content is further enriched through selective inclusion of additional experimental data. Entries are available to anyone through free CSD community web services. Linking services developed and maintained by the CCDC, combined with the use of standard identifiers, facilitate discovery from other resources. Data can also be accessed through CCDC and third party software applications and through an application programming interface.",

    "abstract": "Several methods for absolute structure refinement were tested using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data collected using Cu Kα radiation for 23 crystals with no element heavier than oxygen: conventional refinement using an inversion twin model, estimation using intensity quotients in SHELXL2012, estimation using Bayesian methods in PLATON, estimation using restraints consisting of numerical intensity differences in CRYSTALS and estimation using differences and quotients in TOPAS-Academic where both quantities were coded in terms of other structural parameters and implemented as restraints. The conventional refinement approach yielded accurate values of the Flack parameter, but with standard uncertainties ranging from 0.15 to 0.77. The other methods also yielded accurate values of the Flack parameter, but with much higher precision. Absolute structure was established in all cases, even for a hydrocarbon. The procedures in which restraints are coded explicitly in terms of other structural parameters enable the Flack parameter to correlate with these other parameters, so that it is determined along with those parameters during refinement.",

    "abstract": "Published two-body bond-valence parameters for cation–oxygen bonds have been evaluated via the root mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the valence-sum rule for 128 cations, using 180 194 filtered bond lengths from 31 489 coordination polyhedra. Values of the RMSD range from 0.033–2.451 v.u. (1.1–40.9% per unit of charge) with a weighted mean of 0.174 v.u. (7.34% per unit of charge). The set of best published parameters has been determined for 128 ions and used as a benchmark for the determination of new bond-valence parameters in this paper. Two common methods for the derivation of bond-valence parameters have been evaluated: (1) fixing B and solving for R o ; (2) the graphical method. On a subset of 90 ions observed in more than one coordination, fixing B at 0.37 Å leads to a mean weighted-RMSD of 0.139 v.u. (6.7% per unit of charge), while graphical derivation gives 0.161 v.u. (8.0% per unit of charge). The advantages and disadvantages of these (and other) methods of derivation have been considered, leading to the conclusion that current methods of derivation of bond-valence parameters are not satisfactory. A new method of derivation is introduced, the GRG (generalized reduced gradient) method, which leads to a mean weighted-RMSD of 0.128 v.u. (6.1% per unit of charge) over the same sample of 90 multiple-coordination ions. The evaluation of 19 two-parameter equations and 7 three-parameter equations to model the bond-valence–bond-length relation indicates that: (1) many equations can adequately describe the relation; (2) a plateau has been reached in the fit for two-parameter equations; (3) the equation of Brown &amp; Altermatt (1985) is sufficiently good that use of any of the other equations tested is not warranted. Improved bond-valence parameters have been derived for 135 ions for the equation of Brown &amp; Altermatt (1985) in terms of both the cation and anion bond-valence sums using the GRG method and our complete data set.",

    "abstract": "The sixth blind test of organic crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods has been held, with five target systems: a small nearly rigid molecule, a polymorphic former drug candidate, a chloride salt hydrate, a co-crystal and a bulky flexible molecule. This blind test has seen substantial growth in the number of participants, with the broad range of prediction methods giving a unique insight into the state of the art in the field. Significant progress has been seen in treating flexible molecules, usage of hierarchical approaches to ranking structures, the application of density-functional approximations, and the establishment of new workflows and `best practices' for performing CSP calculations. All of the targets, apart from a single potentially disordered Z' = 2 polymorph of the drug candidate, were predicted by at least one submission. Despite many remaining challenges, it is clear that CSP methods are becoming more applicable to a wider range of real systems, including salts, hydrates and larger flexible molecules. The results also highlight the potential for CSP calculations to complement and augment experimental studies of organic solid forms.",

    "abstract": "The identification of materials for advanced energy-storage systems is still mostly based on experimental trial and error. Increasingly, computational tools are sought to accelerate materials discovery by computational predictions. Here are introduced a set of computationally inexpensive software tools that exploit the bond-valence-based empirical force field previously developed by the authors to enable high-throughput computational screening of experimental or simulated crystal-structure models of battery materials predicting a variety of properties of technological relevance, including a structure plausibility check, surface energies, an inventory of equilibrium and interstitial sites, the topology of ion-migration paths in between those sites, the respective migration barriers and the site-specific attempt frequencies. All of these can be predicted from CIF files of structure models at a minute fraction of the computational cost of density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and with the added advantage that all the relevant pathway segments are analysed instead of arbitrarily predetermined paths. The capabilities and limitations of the approach are evaluated for a wide range of ion-conducting solids. An integrated simple kinetic Monte Carlo simulation provides rough (but less reliable) predictions of the absolute conductivity at a given temperature. The automated adaptation of the force field to the composition and charge distribution in the simulated material allows for a high transferability of the force field within a wide range of Lewis acid-Lewis base-type ionic inorganic compounds as necessary for high-throughput screening. While the transferability and precision will not reach the same levels as in DFT simulations, the fact that the computational cost is several orders of magnitude lower allows the application of the approach not only to pre-screen databases of simple structure prototypes but also to structure models of complex disordered or amorphous phases, and provides a path to expand the analysis to charge transfer across interfaces that would be difficult to cover by ab initio methods.",

It is a structurally imperfect form of 14 Å tobermorite that has variable composition and length of (alumino)silicate anions. New structural-chemical formulae are presented for single- and double-chain tobermorite-based phases and equations are provided that can be used to calculate a number of useful quantities from (29)Si NMR data. It is shown that there are no interlayer calcium ions when the silicate chains are of infinite length and that one is added for each tetrahedral `bridging' site that is vacant. Preparations that have Ca/Si greater than about 1.4 include an intermixed Ca-rich phase. It is not possible to generate a structural model for a dimer that is crystal-chemically consistent with known calcium silicate hydrates if the starting structure is an orthotobermorite, i.e. of the type that has been used in all previous studies. Crystal-chemically plausible models are developed that are based instead on clinotobermorite. A number of models that represent different mean chain lengths are developed using crystal-chemical and geometrical reasoning. The models account for experimental observations, including variations in Ca/Si, H2O/Si, (alumino)silicate anion structure and layer spacing.",

    "abstract": "In 2010 we energy-minimized 225 high-quality single-crystal (SX) structures with dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) to establish a quantitative benchmark. For the current paper, 215 organic crystal structures determined from X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data and published in an IUCr journal were energy-minimized with DFT-D and compared to the SX benchmark. The on average slightly less accurate atomic coordinates of XRPD structures do lead to systematically higher root mean square Cartesian displacement (RMSCD) values upon energy minimization than for SX structures, but the RMSCD value is still a good indicator for the detection of structures that deserve a closer look. The upper RMSCD limit for a correct structure must be increased from 0.25 Å for SX structures to 0.35 Å for XRPD structures; the grey area must be extended from 0.30 to 0.40 Å. Based on the energy minimizations, three structures are re-refined to give more precise atomic coordinates. For six structures our calculations provide the missing positions for the H atoms, for five structures they provide corrected positions for some H atoms. Seven crystal structures showed a minor error for a non-H atom. For five structures the energy minimizations suggest a higher space-group symmetry. For the 225 SX structures, the only deviations observed upon energy minimization were three minor H-atom related issues. Preferred orientation is the most important cause of problems. A preferred-orientation correction is the only correction where the experimental data are modified to fit the model. We conclude that molecular crystal structures determined from powder diffraction data that are published in IUCr journals are of high quality, with less than 4% containing an error in a non-H atom.",

One of the most noteworthy is the specific rocking curve observed for EDT data collected using the precession electron diffraction method. This double-peaked curve (dubbed `the camel') may be described with an approximation based on a circular integral of a pseudo-Voigt function and used for intensity extraction by profile fitting. Another specific aspect of electron diffraction data is the high likelihood of errors in the estimation of the crystal orientation, which may arise from the inaccuracies of the goniometer reading, crystal deformations or crystal movement during the data collection. A method for the refinement of crystal orientation for each frame individually is proposed based on the least-squares optimization of simulated diffraction patterns. This method provides typical angular accuracy of the frame orientations of less than 0.05°. These features were implemented in the computer program PETS 2.0. The implementation of the complete data processing workflow in the program PETS and the incorporation of the features specific for electron diffraction data is also described.",

    "abstract": "Crystal structure prediction (CSP) studies are not limited to being a search for the most thermodynamically stable crystal structure, but play a valuable role in understanding polymorphism, as shown by interdisciplinary studies where the crystal energy landscape has been explored experimentally and computationally. CSP usually produces more thermodynamically plausible crystal structures than known polymorphs. This article illustrates some reasons why: because (i) of approximations in the calculations, particularly the neglect of thermal effects (see §1.1); (ii) of the molecular rearrangement during nucleation and growth (see §1.2); (iii) the solid-state structures observed show dynamic or static disorder, stacking faults, other defects or are not crystalline and so represent more than one calculated structure (see §1.3); (iv) the structures are metastable relative to other molecular compositions (see §1.4); (v) the right crystallization experiment has not yet been performed (see §1.5) or (vi) cannot be performed (see §1.6) and the possibility (vii) that the polymorphs are not detected or structurally characterized (see §1.7). Thus, we can only aspire to a general predictive theory for polymorphism, as this appears to require a quantitative understanding of the kinetic factors involved in all possible multi-component crystallizations. For a specific molecule, analysis of the crystal energy landscape shows the potential complexity of its crystallization behaviour.",

Published XRD patterns from C-S-H of Ca/Si ratios ranging from ∼ 0.6 to ∼ 1.7 are fully compatible with nanocrystalline and turbostratic tobermorite. Even at a ratio close or slightly higher than that of jennite (Ca/Si = 1.5) this latter mineral, which is required in some models to describe the structure of C-S-H, is not detected in the experimental XRD patterns. The 001 basal reflection from C-S-H, positioned at ∼ 13.5 Å when the C-S-H structural Ca/Si ratio is low (< 0.9), shifts towards smaller d values and sharpens with increasing Ca/Si ratio, to reach ∼ 11.2 Å when the Ca/Si ratio is higher than 1.5. Calculations indicate that the sharpening of the 001 reflection may be related to a crystallite size along c* (i.e. a mean number of stacked layers) increasing with the C-S-H Ca/Si ratio. Such an increase would contribute to the observed shift of the 001 reflection, but fails to quantitatively explain it. It is proposed that the observed shift could result from interstratification of at least two tobermorite-like layers, one having a high and the other a low Ca/Si ratio with a basal spacing of 11.3 and 14 Å, respectively.",

The use of single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of a resolution better than sin θ/λ = 0.6 Å(-1) (or d = 0.83 Å) is recommended. The invariom scattering-factor database contains transferable pseudoatom parameters of the Hansen-Coppens multipole model and associated local atomic coordinate systems. Parameters were derived from geometry optimizations of suitable model compounds, whose IUPAC names are also contained in the database. Correct scattering-factor assignment and orientation reproduces molecular electron density to a good approximation. Molecular properties can hence be derived directly from the electron-density model. Coverage of chemical environments in the invariom database has been extended from the original amino acids, proteins and nucleic acid structures to many other environments encountered in organic chemistry. With over 2750 entries it now covers a wide sample of general organic chemistry involving the elements H, C, N and O, and to a lesser extent F, Si, S, P and Cl. With respect to the earlier version of the database, the main modification concerns scattering-factor notation. Modifications improve ease of use and success rates of automatic geometry-based scattering-factor assignment, especially in condensed hetero-aromatic ring systems, making the approach well suited to replace the IAM for structures of organic molecules.",

We confirm the following minimum coordination numbers: [3] Li + , [3] Na + , [4] K + , [4] Rb + , [6] Cs + , [3] Be 2+ , [4] Mg 2+ , [6] Ca 2+ , [6] Sr 2+ and [6] Ba 2+ , but note that some reported examples are the result of extensive dynamic and/or positional short-range disorder and are not ordered arrangements. Some distributions of bond lengths are distinctly multi-modal. This is commonly due to the occurrence of large numbers of structure refinements of a particular structure type in which a particular cation is always present, leading to an over-representation of a specific range of bond lengths. Outliers in the distributions of mean bond lengths are often associated with anomalous values of atomic displacement of the constituent cations and/or anions. For a sample of [6] Na + , the ratio U eq(Na) / U eq(bonded anions) is partially correlated with 〈 [6] Na + —O 2− 〉 ( R 2 = 0.57), suggesting that the mean bond length is correlated with vibrational/displacement characteristics of the constituent ions for a fixed coordination number. Mean bond lengths also show a weak correlation with bond-length distortion from the mean value in general, although some coordination numbers show the widest variation in mean bond length for zero distortion, e.g. Li + in [4]- and [6]-coordination, Na + in [4]- and [6]-coordination. For alkali-metal and alkaline-earth-metal ions, there is a positive correlation between cation coordination number and the grand mean incident bond-valence sum at the central cation, the values varying from 0.84 v.u. for [5] K + to 1.06 v.u. for [8] Li + , and from 1.76 v.u. for [7] Ba 2+ to 2.10 v.u. for [12] Sr 2+ . Bond-valence arguments suggest coordination numbers higher than [12] for K + , Rb + , Cs + and Ba 2+ .",

Specifically, SnSe has been reported to have an ultrahigh thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.6 ± 0.3 in the high-temperature phase. Here we report the evolution of lattice constants, fractional coordinates, site occupancy factors and atomic displacement factors with temperature by means of high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction measured from 100 to 855 K. The structure is shown to be cation defective with a Sn content of 0.982 (4). The anisotropy of the thermal parameters of Sn becomes more pronounced approaching the high-temperature phase transition (∼ 810 K). Anharmonic Gram–Charlier parameters have been refined, but data from single-crystal diffraction appear to be needed to firmly quantify anharmonic features. Based on modelling of the atomic displacement parameters the Debye temperature is found to be 175 (4) K. Conflicting reports concerning the different coordinate system settings in the low-temperature and high-temperature phases are discussed. It is also shown that the high-temperature Cmcm phase is not pseudo-tetragonal as commonly assumed.",

    "abstract": "A list has been compiled of 284 well determined organic structures having more than four crystallographically independent molecules or formula units (i.e. Z' > 4). Another 22 structures were rejected because the space group or unit cell was probably misassigned; the rate for that type of error is then only 7%. The space-group frequencies are unusual; half the structures are in Sohncke groups, partly because the fraction of enantiopure structures of resolvable enantiomers is higher than for lower Z' structures. Careful investigation of the 284 structures has shown that they are very diverse; no simple classification can describe them all. Organizing principles have, however, been recognized for almost all of them. The most common features are simple modulations and hydrogen-bonded aggregates; only 14% of the structures have neither. In 50% of the structures n molecules are related by a pseudotranslation that would be a crystallographic translation but for small molecular displacements and rotations. In 70% of the structures there are aggregates (e.g. n-mers, columns or layers) held together by strong intermolecular interactions; those aggregates usually have approximate local symmetry. Because the n-fold modulations and the n-mers often have n < Z', 85% of the structures with Z' > 5 have several features that combine to give the high Z' value. The number of different molecular conformations is usually small, i.e. one or two in 84% of the structures. More exotic packing features, such as ordered faults and alternating layers of different types, are found in ca 30% of the structures. A very few structures are so complex that it is difficult to understand how the crystals could have formed.",

In this first of two parts focusing on structure generation methods, many crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods performed well for the small but flexible agrochemical compound, successfully reproducing the experimentally observed crystal structures, while few groups were successful for the systems of higher complexity. A powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) assisted exercise demonstrated the use of CSP in successfully determining a crystal structure from a low-quality PXRD pattern. The use of CSP in the prediction of likely cocrystal stoichiometry was also explored, demonstrating multiple possible approaches. Crystallographic disorder emerged as an important theme throughout the test as both a challenge for analysis and a major achievement where two groups blindly predicted the existence of disorder for the first time. Additionally, large-scale comparisons of the sets of predicted crystal structures also showed that some methods yield sets that largely contain the same crystal structures.",

In addition, one non-energy-based scoring function was used. Results showed that periodic DFT-D methods overall agreed with experimental data within expected error margins, while one machine learned model, applying system-specific AIMnet potentials, agreed with experiment in many cases demonstrating promise as an efficient alternative to DFT-based methods.

There are two broad categories of use for ion radii: (1) those methods which use the relative sizes of cation and anion radii to predict local atomic arrangements; (2) those methods which compare the radii of different cations (or the radii of different anions) to predict local atomic arrangements. There is much uncertainty with regard to the relative sizes of cations and anions, giving rise to the common failure of type (1) methods, e.g . Pauling's first rule which purports to relate the coordination adopted by cations to the radius ratio of the constituent cation and anion. Conversely, type (2) methods, which involve comparing the sizes of different cations with each other (or different anions with each other), can give very accurate predictions of site occupancies, physical properties etc . Methods belonging to type (2) can equally well use the characteristic bond lengths themselves (from which the radii are derived) in place of radii to develop correlations and predict crystal properties. Extensive quantum-mechanical calculations of electron density in crystals in the literature indicate that the radii of both cations and anions are quite variable with local arrangement, suggesting significant problems with any use of ion radii. However, the dichotomy between the experimentally derived ion radii and the quantum-mechanical calculations of electron density in crystals is removed by the recognition that ion radii are proxy variables for characteristic bond lengths in type (2) relations.",

Fragment-based second-order Möller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] predict the thermal expansion and the temperature dependence of the enthalpies, entropies and Gibbs free energies of sublimation in good agreement with experiment. The errors introduced by neglecting thermal expansion in the enthalpy and entropy cancel somewhat in the Gibbs free energy. The resulting ∼ 1–2 kJ mol −1 errors in the free energy near room temperature are comparable to or smaller than the errors expected from the electronic structure treatment, but they may be sufficiently large to affect free-energy rankings among energetically close polymorphs.",

One of the primary applications of these materials is in the adsorption and separation of gases, with potential benefits to the energy, transport and medical sectors. In situ crystallography of MOFs under gas atmospheres has enabled the behaviour of the frameworks under gas loading to be investigated and has established the precise location of adsorbed gas molecules in a significant number of MOFs. This article reviews progress in such crystallographic studies, which has taken place over the past decade, but has its origins in earlier studies of zeolites, clathrates etc. The review considers studies by single-crystal or powder diffraction using either X-rays or neutrons. Features of MOFs that strongly affect gas sorption behaviour are discussed in the context of in situ crystallographic studies, specifically framework flexibility, and the presence of (organic) functional groups and unsaturated (open) metal sites within pores that can form specific interactions with gas molecules.",

Variations in mean bond length are ∼0.06–0.09 Å for strongly bonded oxyanions of metalloid and post-transition metal ions, and ∼0.1–0.3 Å for ions showing lone-pair stereoactivity. Bond-length distortion is confirmed to be a leading cause of variation in mean bond lengths for ions with stereoactive lone-pair electrons. For strongly bonded cations ( i.e. oxyanions), the causes of mean bond-length variation are unclear; the most plausible cause of mean bond-length variation for these ions is the effect of structure type, i.e. stress resulting from the inability of a structure to adopt its characteristic a priori bond lengths.",

The purpose of this paper is to reinforce the importance and utility of proper crystal-chemical and geometrical reasoning in structural studies. It is achieved by using such reasoning to generate new yet fundamental information about layered double hydroxides (LDH), a large, much-studied family of compounds. LDH phases are derived from layered single hydroxides by the substitution of a fraction ( x ) of the divalent cations by trivalent. Equations are derived that enable calculation of x from the a parameter of the unit cell and vice versa , which can be expected to be of widespread utility as a sanity test for extant and future structure determinations and computer simulation studies. The phase at x = 0 is shown to be an α form of divalent metal hydroxide rather than the β polymorph. Crystal-chemically sensible model structures are provided for β-Zn(OH) 2 and Ni- and Mg-based carbonate LDH phases that have any trivalent cation and any value of x , including x = 0 [ i.e. for α- M (OH) 2 · m H 2 O phases].",

These structures and 12 previously determined citrate structures were optimized using density functional techniques. The central portion of a citrate ion is fairly rigid, while the conformations of the terminal carboxylate groups exhibit no preferences. The citrate–metal bonding is ionic. Trends in metal–citrate coordination are noted. The energy of an O—H...O hydrogen bond is proportional to the square root of the H...acceptor Mulliken overlap population, and a correlation between the hydrogen bond energy and the H...acceptor distance was developed: E (kJ mol −1 ) = 137.5 (5) − 45.7 (8) (H... A , Å). The hydrogen bond contribution to the crystal energy ranges from 62.815 to 627.6 kJ mol −1 citrate −1 and comprises ∼5 to 30% of the crystal energy. The general order of ionization of the three carboxylic acid groups of citric acid is: central, terminal, terminal, although there are a few exceptions. Comparisons of the refined and DFT-optimized structures indicate that crystal structures determined using powder diffraction data may not be as accurate as single-crystal structures.",

For Tt = Sn, Pb, they crystallize as an 'ideal' perovskite-type structure (Pm3m, cP5); however, all of them show distinct anisotropies of the displacement ellipsoids of the M atoms at room temperature. This behavior vanishes on cooling for M = Ca, Sr, Eu, and the structures can be regarded as `ideal' cubic perovskites at 50 K. The anisotropies of the displacement ellipsoids are much more enhanced in the case of the Ba compounds. Finally, their structures undergo a phase transition at ∼ 150 K. They change from cubic to orthorhombic (Ibmm, oI20) upon cooling, with slightly tilted OBa6 octahedra, and bonding angles O-Ba-O ≃ 174° (100 K). For the larger Ba(2+) cations, the structural changes are in agreement with smaller tolerance factors (t) as defined by Goldschmidt. Similar structural behavior is observed for Ca3TtO. Smaller Tt(4-) anions (Si, Ge) introduce reduced tolerance factors. Both compounds Ca3SiO and Ca3GeO with cubic structures at 500 K, change into orthorhombic (Ibmm) at room temperature. Whereby, Ca3SiO is the only representative within the M3TtO family where three polymorphs can be found within the temperature range 500-50 K: Pm3m-Ibmm-Pbnm. They show tiny differences in the tilting of the OCa6 octahedra, expressed by O-Ca-O bond angles of 180° (500 K), ∼ 174° (295 K) and 170° (100 K). For larger M (Sr, Eu, Ba), together with smaller Tt (Si, Ge) atoms, pronounced tilting of the OM6 octahedra, and bonding angles of O-M-O ≃ 160° (295 K) are observed. They crystallize in the anti-GdFeO3 type of structure (Pbnm, oP20), and no phase transitions occur between 500 and 50 K. The observed phase transitions are all accompanied by multiple twinning, in terms of pseudo-merohedry or reticular pseudo-merohedry.",

Doing so increased the accuracy of our predictions by 2-3 percentage points over using any one pair. We also included the Mendeleev numbers of the A and B atoms to this set of feature pairs. Doing this and using the capabilities of our machine learning algorithm, the gradient tree boosting classifier, enabled us to generate a new type of structure plot that has the simplicity of one based on using just the Mendeleev numbers, but with the added advantages of having a higher accuracy and providing a measure of likelihood of the predicted structure.",

It was primarily based on 6728 structures containing X —H and C—F and no atom heavier than chlorine. Of the 28 451 C—F moieties in these structures, 1051 interact with X —H groups. However, over three-quarters of these interactions are either the weaker components of bifurcated hydrogen bonds (so likely to be incidental contacts) or occur in structures where there is a clear insufficiency of good hydrogen-bond acceptors such as oxygen, nitrogen or halide. In structures where good acceptors are entirely absent, there is about a 2 in 3 chance that a given X —H group will donate to fluorine. Viable alternatives are X —H...π hydrogen bonds (especially to electron-rich aromatics) and dihydrogen bonds. The average H...F distances of X —H...F—C interactions are significantly shorter for C R 3 F ( R = C or H) and C sp 2 —F acceptors than for C R F 3 . The X —H...F angle distribution is consistent with a weak energetic preference for linearity, but that of H...F—C suggests a flat energy profile in the range 100–180°. X —H...F—C interactions are more likely when the acceptor is C sp 2 —F or C R 3 F, and when the donor is C—NH 2 . They also occur significantly more often in structures containing tertiary alcohols or solvent molecules, or with Z ′ &gt; 1, i.e. when there may be unusual packing problems. It is extremely rare to find X —H...F—C interactions in structures where there are several unused good acceptors. When it does happen, there is often a clear reason, e.g. awkwardly shaped molecules whose packing isolates a donor group from the good acceptors.",

    "abstract": "Carboxyl and carboxylate groups form important supramolecular motifs (synthons). Besides carboxyl cyclic dimers, carboxyl and carboxylate groups can associate through a single hydrogen bond. Carboxylic groups can further form polymeric-like catemer chains within crystals. To date, no exhaustive classification of these motifs has been established. In this work, 17 association types were identified (13 carboxyl–carboxyl and 4 carboxyl–carboxylate motifs) by taking into account the syn and anti carboxyl conformers, as well as the syn and anti lone pairs of the O atoms. From these data, a simple rule was derived stating that only eight distinct catemer motifs involving repetitive combinations of syn and anti carboxyl groups can be formed. Examples extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) for all identified dimers and catemers are presented, as well as statistical data related to their occurrence and conformational preferences. The inter-carboxyl(ate) and carboxyl(ate)–water hydrogen-bond properties are described, stressing the occurrence of very short (strong) hydrogen bonds. The precise characterization and classification of these supramolecular motifs should be of interest in crystal engineering, pharmaceutical and also biomolecular sciences, where similar motifs occur in the form of pairs of Asp/Glu amino acids or motifs involving ligands bearing carboxyl(ate) groups. Hence, we present data emphasizing how the analysis of hydrogen-containing small molecules of high resolution can help understand structural aspects of larger and more complex biomolecular systems of lower resolution.",

A new benchmark set of 59 crystal structures (termed POLY59) for testing quantum chemical methods based on the blind test target crystals is presented. We focus on different means to include London dispersion interactions within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. We show the impact of pairwise dispersion corrections like the semi-empirical D2 scheme, the Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) method, and the density-dependent dispersion correction dDsC. Recent methodological progress includes higher-order contributions in both the many-body and multipole expansions. We use the D3 correction with Axilrod-Teller-Muto type three-body contribution, the TS based many-body dispersion (MBD), and the nonlocal van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF2). The density functionals with D3 and MBD correction provide an energy ranking of the blind test polymorphs in excellent agreement with the experimentally found structures. As a computationally less demanding method, we test our recently presented minimal basis Hartree-Fock method (HF-3c) and a density functional tight-binding Hamiltonian (DFTB). Considering the speed-up of three to four orders of magnitudes, the energy ranking provided by the low-cost methods is very reasonable. We compare the computed geometries with the corresponding X-ray data where TPSS-D3 performs best. The importance of zero-point vibrational energy and thermal effects on crystal densities is highlighted.",

The modulation parameter, i.e. the change in the crystal optical path normalized by thickness and mechanical stress, was calculated based on piezooptic and elastic compliance tensor constants. For the geometries of the most effective piezo-optic interactions, this parameter reaches rather large values (16–17) × 10 −12 m 2 N −1 . Anisotropy of the photoelastic and acoustooptic effects is explored by means of indicative surfaces, considering the directions of light propagation and polarization, the direction of uniaxial compression or lattice distortion caused by the propagation of the acoustic wave. DFT calculations indicate BaWO 4 and PbWO 4 crystals as the most effective acousto-optic materials, predicting the figure of merit constant M 2 ∼ 20 × 10 −15 s 3 kg −1 . The methodology proposed combines the DFT calculations and photoelasticity caused by uniaxial compression of the crystal lattice, with particular emphasis on its anisotropy.

    "abstract": "Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), C7H8ClN3O4S2, is a diuretic BCS (Biopharmaceutics Classification System) class IV drug which has primary and secondary sulfonamide groups. To modify the aqueous solubility of the drug, co-crystals with biologically safe co-formers were screened. Multi-component molecular crystals of HCT were prepared with nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, succinamide, p-aminobenzoic acid, resorcinol and pyrogallol using liquid-assisted grinding. The co-crystals were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry. Single crystal structures were obtained for four of them. The N-H...O sulfonamide catemer synthons found in the stable polymorph of pure HCT are replaced in the co-crystals by drug-co-former heterosynthons. Isostructural co-crystals with nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are devoid of the common sulfonamide dimer/catemer synthons. Solubility and stability experiments were carried out for the co-crystals in water (neutral pH) under ambient conditions. Among the six binary systems, the co-crystal with p-aminobenzoic acid showed a sixfold increase in solubility compared with pure HCT, and stability up to 24 h in an aqueous medium. The co-crystals with nicotinamide, resorcinol and pyrogallol showed only a 1.5-2-fold increase in solubility and transformed to HCT within 1 h of the dissolution experiment. An inverse correlation is observed between the melting points of the co-crystals and their solubilities.",

Pearson's Crystal Data. Crystal Structure Database for Inorganic Compounds , Release 2014/2015, ASM International, Materials Park, Ohio, USA]. The coordination polyhedra around the cations and the borohydride anion are determined, and constitute the basis of the structural systematics underlying metal borohydride chemistry in various frameworks and variants of ionic packing, including complex anions and the packing of neutral molecules in the crystal. Underlying nets are determined by topology analysis using the program TOPOS [Blatov (2006). IUCr CompComm. Newsl. 7 , 4–38]. It is found that the Pauling rules for ionic crystals apply to all non-molecular borohydride crystal structures, and that the latter can often be derived by simple deformation of the close-packed anionic lattices c.c.p. and h.c.p. , by partially removing anions and filling tetrahedral or octahedral sites. The deviation from an ideal close packing is facilitated in metal borohydrides with respect to the oxide due to geometrical and electronic considerations of the BH 4 − anion (tetrahedral shape, polarizability). This review on crystal chemistry of borohydrides and their similarity to oxides is a contribution which should serve materials engineers as a roadmap to design new materials, synthetic chemists in their search for promising compounds to be prepared, and materials scientists in understanding the properties of novel materials.",

Precision of the lattice parameters (∼0.0002% in a and 0.0004% in c for D2O, 0.0008% in a and 0.0015% in c for H2O) is ensured by use of the time-of-flight method on one of the longest primary neutron flight-path instruments in the world, the High-Resolution Powder Diffractometer at the ISIS neutron source. These data provide a more precise description of the negative thermal expansion of the material at low temperatures than the previous synchrotron `gold standard' [Röttger et al. (1994). Acta Cryst. B50, 644-648], including the region below 10 K where the lattice parameters saturate. The volume expansivity of both isotopologues turns negative below 59-60 K, in excellent agreement with a recent dilatometry study. The axial expansivities are highly isotropic (differing by < 1% in D2O ice Ih). Furthermore, the c/a ratio of different D2O ice samples exhibit a statistically significant dispersion of ∼0.015% below 150 K that appears to depend on the thermal history of the sample, which disappears on warming above 150 K. Similarly, H2O ice exhibits a `kink' in the c/a ratio at ∼115 K. The most plausible explanation is a freezing-in of the molecular reorientation process on cooling and subsequent relaxation on warming.",

    "abstract": "In surficial environments, the fate of many elements is influenced by their interactions with the phyllomanganate vernadite, a nano-sized and turbostratic variety of birnessite. To advance our understanding of the surface reactivity of vernadite as a function of pH, synthetic vernadite (δ-MnO 2 ) was equilibrated at pH ranging from 3 to 10 and characterized structurally using chemical methods, thermogravimetry and modelling of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. With decreasing pH, the number of vacant layer sites increases in the octahedral layers of δ-MnO 2 (from 0.14 per layer octahedron at pH 10 to 0.17 at pH 3), whereas the number of layer Mn 3+ is, within errors, equal to 0.12 per layer octahedron over the whole pH range. Vacant layer sites are capped by interlayer Mn 3+ sorbed as triple corner-sharing surface complexes (TC sites). The increasing number of interlayer Mn 3+ with decreasing pH (from 0.075 per layer octahedron at pH 10 to 0.175 at pH 3) results in the decrease of the average Mn oxidation degree (from 3.80 ± 0.01 at pH 10 to 3.70 ± 0.01 at pH 3) and in the lowering of the Na/Mn ratio (from 27.66 ± 0.20 at pH 10 to 6.99 ± 0.16 at pH 3). In addition, in-plane unit-cell parameters are negatively correlated to the number of interlayer Mn at TC sites and decrease with decreasing pH (from b = 2.842 Å at pH 10 to b = 2.834 Å at pH 3), layer symmetry being systematically hexagonal with a = b × 3 1/2 . Finally, modelling of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicates that crystallite size in the ab plane and along the c * axis decreases with decreasing pH, ranging respectively from 7 nm to 6 nm, and from 1.2 nm to 1.0 nm (pH 10 and 3, respectively). Following their characterization, dry samples were sealed in polystyrene vials, kept in the dark, and re-analysed 4 and 8 years later. With ageing time and despite the dry state, layer Mn 3+ extensively migrates to the interlayer most likely to minimize steric strains resulting from the Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn 3+ octahedra. When the number of interlayer Mn 3+ at TC sites resulting from this migration reaches the maximum value of ∼ 1/3 per layer octahedron, interlayer species from adjacent layers share their coordination sphere, resulting in cryptomelane-like tunnel structure fragments (with a 2 × 2 tunnel size) with a significantly improved layer stacking order.",

In this review, we explore these relationships by asking whether and how XBs can replace, compete against or behave independently of HBs in various biological systems. The complex relationships between the two interactions inform us of the challenges we face in fully utilizing XBs to control the affinity and recognition of inhibitors against their therapeutic targets, and to control the structure and function of proteins, nucleic acids and other biomolecular scaffolds.",

Then the physical meaning of the PDF is explained and its use is demonstrated with several examples. Special features of electron scattering regarding the PDF calculations are discussed.

The Laplacian of electron density exhibits the smallest anisotropy and yields a vague picture of the outermost electronic shells. The one-electron potential does not show such a deficiency and reveals that the valence electron shell for the halogen-bond acceptor iodine is always wider than that for the halogen-bond donor iodine along its σ-hole direction. We have concluded that the one-electron potential is the most suitable for classification of the iodine–iodine bonds and interactions in complicated cases, while the electron localization function allows to distinguish the diiodine molecule bonded with the monoiodide anion from the typical triiodide anion.",

Their distinction is in their geometry that both results in an unusual mechanism to break inversion symmetry, and also produces a 2D triangular lattice of Mn spins, which is subject to geometrical magnetic frustration due to the antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbour Mn ions. This unique combination makes the h-RMnO$_3$ a model system to test ideas of spin-lattice coupling, particularly when the both the improper ferroelectricity and the Mn trimerisation that appears to determine the symmetry of the magnetic structure arise from the same structure distortion. In this review, we demonstrate how the use of both neutron and X-ray diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering techniques have been essential to paint this comprehensive and coherent picture of the h-RMnO$_3$.",

    "abstract": "Uranyl sulfates, including those occurring in Nature (∼40 known members), possess particularly interesting structures. They exhibit a great dimensional and topological diversity of structures: from those based upon clusters of polyhedra to layered structures. There is also a great variability in the type of linkages between U and S polyhedra. From the point of view of complexity of those structures (measured as the amount of Shannon information per unit cell), most of the natural uranyl sulfates are intermediate (300–500 bits per cell) to complex (500–1000 bits per cell) with some exceptions, which can be considered as very complex structures (&gt;1000 bits per cell). These exceptions are minerals alwilkinsite-(Y) (1685.95 bits per cell), sejkoraite-(Y) (1859.72 bits per cell), and natrozippeite (2528.63 bits per cell). The complexity of these structures is due to an extensive hydrogen bonding network which is crucial for the stability of these mineral structures. The hydrogen bonds help to propagate the charge from the highly charged interlayer cations (such as Y 3+ ) or to link a high number of interlayer sites ( i.e. five independent Na sites in the monoclinic natrozippeite) occupied by monovalent cations (Na + ). The concept of informational ladder diagrams was applied to the structures of uranyl sulfates in order to quantify the particular contributions to the overall informational complexity and identifying the most contributing sources (topology, real symmetry, interlayer bonding).",

Through quantum crystallography (QCr), we meticulously analyze the electron density and bonding nature of Ca-sc at pressures up to 40 GPa. Our theoretical framework reveals a pressure-induced electronic transition from s to d character, resulting in the formation of multi-centered bonds within Ca 8 clusters. The topological analysis corroborates the existence of non-nuclear maxima and electron localization features characteristic of HPEs.

    "abstract": "The study of magnetic structures from a crystallographic perspective remains a niche field, largely confined to physical crystallography and microscopic magnetism. Unlike general or superspace crystallography, magnetic structure analysis lacks standardization, primarily due to the small research community and the reliance on specialized experimental techniques like neutron diffraction. However, emerging topics in condensed matter physics, such as topological materials, multiferroics, and skyrmions, have heightened the importance of understanding magnetic ordering. As a result, the analysis of magnetic neutron scattering data is becoming increasingly relevant, requiring unified methodologies. Since 2011, the IUCr Commission on Magnetic Structures has been working to improve the situation. This paper reviews the most commonly used methods for describing magnetic structures and highlights the capabilities of the FullProf Suite for analysing magnetic neutron diffraction data.",

    "abstract": "Using the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), it is shown that the acidic C-H donors of chloroform and dichloromethane, respectively, form hydrogen bonds with N, O, S, halides or carbon-bound halogens in 82% and 77% of structures in which such interactions can occur. This hydrogen-bond potency is retained to a significant degree even in the presence of the more conventional O-H and N-H donors. The hydrogen-bond propensities exhibited by the C-H protons in CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 are similar to those of the acetylenic C-C≡C-H proton. However, involvement of the Cl atoms of CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 in non-bonded interactions is rather limited: the propensities for formation of (O or N)-H...Cl bonds are only 6% in both cases, while the propensities for the formation of halogen-halogen bonds is generally < 15%, with only Cl...Br interactions having slightly higher values. While C(phenyl)-H...Cl interactions are commonly observed, they are of low propensity and have distances at the upper end of the van der Waals limit. We conclude that the acidic C-H protons in chloroform and dichloromethane solvent molecules play a clear role in the involvement of these molecules in molecular aggregation in crystal structures, and this is exemplified by hydrogen-bond predictions made using the statistical propensity tool which is now part of the CSD system.",

    "abstract": "In the last few decades Li-ion batteries changed the way we store energy, becoming a key element of our everyday life. Their continuous improvement is tightly bound to the understanding of lithium (de)intercalation phenomena in electrode materials. Here we address the use of operando diffraction techniques to understand these mechanisms. We focus on powerful probes such as neutrons and synchrotron X-ray radiation, which have become increasingly familiar to the electrochemical community. After discussing the general benefits (and drawbacks) of these characterization techniques and the work of customization required to adapt standard electrochemical cells to an operando diffraction experiment, we highlight several very recent results. We concentrate on important electrode materials such as the spinels Li1 + xMn2 - xO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.10) and LiNi0.4Mn1.6O4. Thorough investigations led by operando neutron powder diffraction demonstrated that neutrons are highly sensitive to structural parameters that cannot be captured by other means (for example, atomic Debye-Waller factors and lithium site occupancy). Synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction reveals how LiMn2O4 is subject to irreversibility upon the first electrochemical cycle, resulting in severe Bragg peak broadening. Even more interestingly, we show for the first time an ordering scheme of the elusive composition Li0.5Mn2O4, through the coexistence of Mn(3+):Mn(4+) 1:3 cation ordering and lithium/vacancy ordering. More accurately written as Li0.5Mn(3+)0.5Mn(4+)1.5O4, this intermediate phase loses the Fd\\overline 3m symmetry, to be correctly described in the P213 space group.",

    "abstract": "In crystals, polymeric chain molecules often adopt helical structures. Neglecting small distortions possibly caused by an anisotropic environment within the crystal, the symmetry of the single helix can be described by a rod group, which has translational symmetry in one dimension. The rod groups have Hermann–Mauguin symbols similar to space groups, beginning with a script style \\scr p followed by a screw-axis symbol; the order of the screw axis can adopt any value. In a crystal, the rod-site symmetry, the so-called penetration rod group, must be a common crystallographic rod subgroup of the molecular rod group and the space group. Instructions are given for the derivation of the rod subgroups in question for a molecular helical rod group of any order. In polymer chemistry, a helix is designated by a (chemical) symbol like 7/2, which means 7 repeating units in 2 coil turns of covalent bonds per translational period. The corresponding Hermann–Mauguin screw-axis symbol is easily derived with a simple formula from this chemical symbol; for a 7/2 helix it is 7 3 or 7 4 , depending on chirality. However, it is not possible to deduce the chemical symbol from the Hermann–Mauguin symbol, because it depends on where the covalent bonds are assumed to exist. Covalent bonds are irrelevant for symmetry considerations; a symmetry symbol does not depend on them. A chemically right-handed helix can have a left-handed screw axis. The derivation of the Hermann–Mauguin symbol of a multiple helix is not that easy, as it depends on the mutual position of the interlocked helices; conversion formulae for simpler cases are presented. Instead of covalent bonds, other kinds of linking can serve to define the chemical helix, for example, edge- or face-sharing coordination polyhedra.",

    "abstract": "The possibility to determine electron-density distribution in crystals has been an enormous breakthrough, stimulated by a favourable combination of equipment for X-ray and neutron diffraction at low temperature, by the development of simplified, though accurate, electron-density models refined from the experimental data and by the progress in charge density analysis often in combination with theoretical work. Many years after the first successful charge density determination and analysis, scientists face new challenges, for example: (i) determination of the finer details of the electron-density distribution in the atomic cores, (ii) simultaneous refinement of electron charge and spin density or (iii) measuring crystals under perturbation. In this context, the possibility of obtaining experimental charge density at high pressure has recently been demonstrated [Casati et al. (2016). Nat. Commun. 7 , 10901]. This paper reports on the necessities and pitfalls of this new challenge, focusing on the species syn -1,6:8,13-biscarbonyl[14]annulene. The experimental requirements, the expected data quality and data corrections are discussed in detail, including warnings about possible shortcomings. At the same time, new modelling techniques are proposed, which could enable specific information to be extracted, from the limited and less accurate observations, like the degree of localization of double bonds, which is fundamental to the scientific case under examination.",

We have therefore determined crystal structures of KLaS2, KPrS2, KEuS2, KGdS2, KLuS2, KYS2, RbYS2, which belong to the α-NaFeO2 structural family (R3m), as well as NaLaS2, which is derived from the disordered NaCl structural type (Fm3m). The determined structures were compared with known members of the group 1 as well as thallium(I) rare-earth sulfides by the standard tools of crystal-chemical analysis such as comparison of bond-valences, analysis of interatomic distances and comparison of the unit-cell parameters. The results indicate why the cubic structural type is limited to Li(+) and Na(+) members of the series only. The analysis has also revealed frequent problems in the reported crystal structures, especially in the determination of the K(+) compounds, probably due to severe absorption and different accuracy and sensitivity of various instruments. Intense diffuse scattering has been discovered in NaLaS2, which will be the subject of further investigation. The newly determined as well as already known structures are summarized, together with critical comments about possible errors in the previous structure determinations.",

The previous algorithm used scale factors computed in an iterative way based on the assumption (which turned out to be not always correct) that a real over–under bonding effect affects mainly the anionic charges of each single anion, without grossly modifying the total charge of each type of anion. The new, more general approach is not based on any a priori assumption but treats separately the homoligand sub-polyhedra and attributes to each type of atom a fraction of the charge of the atom coordinated to it, computed in a self-consistent iterative way. The distinction between the bonding and non-bonding contact is also redefined in terms of the mean fictive ionic radii (MEFIR), without the need of an empirical parameter, used in the previous algorithm. CHARDI equations are generalized in terms of the new approach and a series of examples is presented.",

As a result of the phase transition, the a, c and α parameters change jumpwise, whereas the changes in b parameter are continuous through the phase transition point. The high-pressure form is monoclinic (P2111) and has Z′ equal to 2, the two independent molecules differing in their conformations. The hydrogen bonds expand slightly in the high-pressure polymorph after the transition, and this expansion is interrelated with the changes in molecular conformations enabling a denser packing. The transition is reversible, but the crystal quality deteriorates as a result of multiple compression–decompression cycles, and a pseudomerohedral twinning accompanies the transformation.",

A transition from a tetragonal ( P 4 mm ) to a cubic (Pm \\bar 3 m) phase has been revealed near 753 K. In the non-centrosymmetric P 4 mm symmetry group, the difference in relative displacement between Pb and O along the c -axis is much larger than that between Ti and O. The Pb and Ti cations contribute sufficiently to polarization being shifted in the opposite direction compared with the shift of O atoms. Deviation from the linear changes in Debye–Waller factors and bonding distances in the tetragonal phases can be interpreted as a precursor phenomenon before the phase transition. Disturbance of the temperature factor U eq for O is observed in the vicinity of the transition point, while U eq values for Pb and Ti are continuously changing with increasing temperature. The O site includes the clear configurational disorder in the cubic phase. The polar local positional distortions remain in the cubic phase and are regarded as the cause of the paraelectricity. Estimated values of the Debye temperature Θ D for Pb and Ti are 154 and 467 K in the tetragonal phase and decrease 22% in the high-temperature phase. Effective potentials for Pb and Ti change significantly and become soft after the phase transition.",

Here it is shown that two scattering phenomena, which are usually omitted from multi-slice simulations, reduce the dynamical effect: solvent scattering reduces the phase differences within the exit beam and inelastic scattering followed by elastic scattering results in diffusion of dynamical scattering out of Bragg peaks.

Functional group identification was studied with FT–IR (Fourier transform–IR) spectroscopy. The positions of proton and carbon atoms in the BASQ compound were analyzed using NMR spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "The diamond-anvil cell (DAC) was invented 60 years ago, ushering in a new era for material sciences, extending research into the dimension of pressure. Most structural determinations and chemical research have been conducted at ambient pressure, i.e. the atmospheric pressure on Earth. However, modern experimental techniques are capable of generating pressure and temperature higher than those at the centre of Earth. Such extreme conditions can be used for obtaining unprecedented chemical compounds, but, most importantly, all fundamental phenomena can be viewed and understood from a broader perspective. This knowledge, in turn, is necessary for designing new generations of materials and applications, for example in the pharmaceutical industry or for obtaining super-hard materials. The high-pressure chambers in the DAC are already used for a considerable variety of experiments, such as chemical reactions, crystallizations, measurements of electric, dielectric and magnetic properties, transformations of biological materials as well as experiments on living tissue. Undoubtedly, more applications involving elevated pressure will follow. High-pressure methods become increasingly attractive, because they can reduce the sample volume and compress the intermolecular contacts to values unattainable by other methods, many times stronger than at low temperature. The compressed materials reveal new information about intermolecular interactions and new phases of single- and multi-component compounds can be obtained. At the same time, high-pressure techniques, and particularly those of X-ray diffraction using the DAC, have been considerably improved and many innovative developments implemented. Increasingly more equipment of in-house laboratories, as well as the instrumentation of beamlines at synchrotrons and thermal neutron sources are dedicated to high-pressure research.",

    "abstract": "The structure and crystal chemistry of vernadite in ferromanganese crusts from the Magellan Seamount in the north-west Pacific Ocean have been investigated using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD patterns of vernadite mainly show two strong diffraction peaks at 2.42-2.43 Å and 1.41 Å without or with a broad (001) diffraction peak, indicating thin layer nanophases along the c-direction. TEM images show flat and curved sheet-like nanocrystals with (001) layer thickness of ∼7.2 Å and ∼9.6 Å, and their interstratified structure. PDF patterns of the vernadite are similar to those from synthetic δ-MnO2 and defective birnessite, suggesting a phyllomanganate framework. Combined XRD/PDF patterns suggest that vernadite in the outer part is associated with a higher density interlayer species at triple-edge sharing sites. The proportion of the 10 Å phase increases from the outer (young) part to the inner (old) part of the Mn crusts due to aging and sorption of Mn, Co and Ni from ambient seawater. This study suggests that this combined method of synchrotron radiation XRD/PDF and high-resolution TEM is a powerful tool to determine atomic structures of poorly crystallized nano-minerals. The mixture model of vernadite structure will help to understand the partitioning and distribution of trace elements in the ferromanganese crusts.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen is present in almost all of the molecules in living things. It is very reactive and forms bonds with most of the elements, terminating their valences and enhancing their chemistry. X-ray diffraction is the most common method for structure determination. It depends on scattering of X-rays from electron density, which means the single electron of hydrogen is difficult to detect. Generally, neutron diffraction data are used to determine the accurate position of hydrogen atoms. However, the requirement for good quality single crystals, costly maintenance and the limited number of neutron diffraction facilities means that these kind of results are rarely available. Here it is shown that the use of Transferable Aspherical Atom Model (TAAM) instead of Independent Atom Model (IAM) in routine structure refinement with X-ray data is another possible solution which largely improves the precision and accuracy of X-H bond lengths and makes them comparable to averaged neutron bond lengths. TAAM, built from a pseudoatom databank, was used to determine the X-H bond lengths on 75 data sets for organic molecule crystals. TAAM parametrizations available in the modified University of Buffalo Databank (UBDB) of pseudoatoms applied through the DiSCaMB software library were used. The averaged bond lengths determined by TAAM refinements with X-ray diffraction data of atomic resolution (dmin ≤ 0.83 Å) showed very good agreement with neutron data, mostly within one single sample standard deviation, much like Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). Atomic displacements for both hydrogen and non-hydrogen atoms obtained from the refinements systematically differed from IAM results. Overall TAAM gave better fits to experimental data of standard resolution compared to IAM. The research was accompanied with development of software aimed at providing user-friendly tools to use aspherical atom models in refinement of organic molecules at speeds comparable to routine refinements based on spherical atom model.",

In contrast to the previously reported phase transition at about 100 K [Stöwe (1996). J. Solid State Chem . 127 , 202–210], our high-precision LT neutron diffraction data show that the body-centred RT symmetry is indeed maintained down to 2.7 K. No sign of a structural change from RT down to 2.7 K was observed. The most significant change depending on temperature was observed for the U ion position and the U–U distance along the c direction, implying its potential importance as a magnetic interaction path. No magnetic order could be deduced from the neutron diffraction data refinement at 2.7 K, consistent with bulk magnetometry. Assuming normal thermal evolution of the lattice parameters, moderately large linear thermal expansion coefficients of about α = 2.8 (7) × 10 −5 K −1 are estimated.",

    "abstract": "As an excellent representative of all-inorganic perovskite materials, CsPbBr 3 has been widely used in high-energy rays or high-energy particles detection for its outstanding high carrier mobility and long diffusion length. The great challenges and opportunities in these fields are crystal growth technology, especially the high-quality and large-sized CsPbBr 3 single crystals. In this work, the influences of growth parameters (temperature gradient, growth rate, cooling rate) and thermal stress by the vertical Bridgman method on the quality and performance of CsPbBr 3 crystals are systematically studied. The final results show that 10°C cm −1 is the optimized temperature gradient and 0.5 mm h −1 is the suitable growth rate for CsPbBr 3 crystal growth. The study also shows that a cooling rate of 10°C h −1 for the general temperature interval and 1°C h −1 for the phase transition temperature interval is helpful to balance crystal growth efficiency as well as crystal quality. Crystal cracks caused by thermal stress as well as crystal adhesion on the ampoule can be effectively solved by depositing a uniform carbon film on the ampoule in advance. The optical, electrical and detection performance are also investigated. The optical characterization in the wavelength region ranging from ultraviolet to infrared indicates the crystal has a low density of deep-level defects and good crystal quality. The resistivity over 10 9 Ω cm and μτ of electrons over 10 −2 cm −2 V −1 proves that the electrical performance of the crystal has met the basic requirement for nuclear radiation detection. The metal–semiconductor–metal structure Ti/Ni/CsPbBr 3 /Ni/Ti detector fabricated from the optimized CsPbBr 3 single crystal has an energy resolution of 12.85% ( 137 Cs, 662 keV). The purpose of this work is to provide a useful guide and reference for the future exploration of repeatable and improvable CsPbBr 3 crystal growth technology.",

The method is based on the similarity measure developed by de Gelder et al. [J. Comput. Chem.

The lattice parameters, molecular position, molecular orientation and selected intramolecular degrees of freedom are optimized until the similarity measure reaches a maximum; subsequently, a Rietveld refinement is carried out. The program FIDEL (FIt with DEviating Lattice parameters) implements this method. The procedure is also suitable for unindexed powder data, powder diagrams of very low quality and powder diagrams of non-phase-pure samples. Various applications are shown, including structure determinations from powder data using crystal structure predictions by standard force-field methods. Other useful applications include the automatic structure determination from powder data starting from the crystal structures of isostructural compounds (e.g. a solvate, hydrate or chemical derivative), or from crystal data measured at a different temperature or pressure.",

Therefore, the disordered crystal structure of azulene was re-refined with invariom non-spherical atomic scattering factors from new single-crystal X-ray diffraction data with a resolution of d = 0.45 Å. An unconstrained refinement results in a molecular geometry with C s symmetry. Refinements constrained to fulfill C 2 v symmetry, as observed in the gas phase and in high-level ab initio calculations, lead to similar figures of merit and residual densities as unconstrained ones. Such models are consistent with the structures from microwave spectroscopy and electron diffraction, albeit they are not the same. It is shown that for the disorder present in azulene, the invariom model describes valence electron density as successfully as it does for non-disordered structures, although the disorder still leads to high correlations mainly between positional parameters. Lattice-energy minimizations on a variety of ordered model structures using dispersion-corrected DFT calculations reveal that the local deviations from the average structure are small. Despite the molecular dipole moment there is no significant molecular ordering in any spatial direction. A superposition of all ordered model structures leads to a calculated average structure, which explains not only the experimental determined atomic coordinates, but also the apparently unusual experimental anisotropic displacement parameters.",

    "abstract": "White lead or basic lead carbonate, 2PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2 , the synthetic analogue of hydrocerussite Pb 3 (OH) 2 (CO 3 ) 2 , has been known since antiquity as the most frequently used white paint. A number of different minerals and synthetic materials compositionally and structurally related to hydrocerussite have been described within the last two decades. Herein, a review is given of general structural principles, chemical variations and IR spectra of the rapidly growing family of hydrocerussite-related minerals and synthetic materials. Only structures containing a hydroxo- and/or oxo-component, i.e. which are compositionally directly related with hydrocerussite and `white lead', are reviewed in detail. An essential structural feature of all the considered phases is the presence of electroneutral [PbCO 3 ] 0 cerussite-type layers or sheets. Various interleaved sheets can be incorporated between the cerussite-type sheets. Different sheets are stacked into two-dimensional blocks separated by the stereochemically active 6 s 2 lone electron pairs on Pb 2+ cations. Minerals and synthetic materials described herein, together with a number of still hypothetical members, constitute a family of modular structures. Hydrocerussite, abellaite and grootfonteinite can be considered to constitute a merotype family of structures. The remaining hydrocerussite-related structures discussed are built on similar principles, but are more complex. Structural architectures of somersetite and slag phase from Lavrion, Attica, Greece, are unique for oxysalt mineral structures in general. Thus, the whole family of hydrocerussite-related phases can be denoted as a plesiotype family of modular structures. The crystal structures of hydrocerussite from Merehead quarry, Somerset, England, and of its synthetic analogue, both determined from single crystals, are reported here for the first time. The results of the infrared (IR) spectroscopy show that this method is useful for distinguishing several different minerals related to hydrocerussite and their synthetic analogues.",

H...O and O—H + H...O distances correlate with O...O distance ( R 2 = 0.94 and 0.96): H...O = 1.273 × O...O – 1.717 Å; O—H + H...O = 1.068 × O...O – 0.170 Å. These equations may be used to locate the hydrogen atom more accurately in a structure refined by X-ray diffraction. For non-metal elements that occur with lone-pair electrons, the most observed state between the n versus n +2 oxidation state is that of highest oxidation state for period 3 cations, and lowest oxidation state for period 4 and 5 cations when bonded to O 2− . Observed O— X —O bond angles indicate that the period 3 non-metal ions P 3+ , S 4+ , Cl 3+ and Cl 5+ are lone-pair seteroactive when bonded to O 2− , even though they do not form secondary bonds. There is no strong correlation between the degree of lone-pair stereoactivity and coordination number when including secondary bonds. There is no correlation between lone-pair stereoactivity and bond-valence sum at the central cation. In synthetic compounds, PO 4 polymerizes via one or two bridging oxygen atoms, but not by three. Partitioning our PO 4 dataset shows that multi-modality in the distribution of bond lengths is caused by the different bond-valence constraints that arise for O br = 0, 1 and 2. For strongly bonded cations, i.e. oxyanions, the most probable cause of mean bond length variation is the effect of structure type, i.e. stress induced by the inability of a structure to follow its a priori bond lengths. For ions with stereoactive lone-pair electrons, the most probable cause of variation is bond-length distortion.",

No phase transition was found below 15 Pa in contrast to previously reported data. Its experimental bulk modulus in the quasi-hydrostatic regime is B 0 = 18.8 (9) GPa with a bulk modulus pressure derivative B ′ 0 = 8.2 (4). However, according to our ab initio calculations, KBrO 3 significantly reduces its rhombohedral distortion via small cooperative movements of the atoms and the structure progressively approaches the cubic symmetry, where the KBr subarray would adopt a topology similar to that of the corresponding B2-type bromide. This rearrangement of atoms is directly related to the Buerger's mechanism of the B 1– B 2 phase transition for halides, confirming that cations (second neighbors) do not arrange in an arbitrary way. The O atoms forming the [BrO 3 ] pyramidal units move smoothly with pressure to the center of the [K 8 ] cube faces, where electron localization function calculations present their maxima in other B 2-type compounds, eventually adopting the perovskite-type structure at P ≃ 152 GPa. Our data on KBrO 3 has been compared with chemically substituted isostructural halates, providing new insights on the compressibility of this family of compounds.",

    "abstract": "Most research on polyoxometalates (POMs) has been devoted to synthetic compounds. However, recent mineralogical discoveries of POMs in mineral structures demonstrate their importance in geochemical systems. In total, 15 different types of POM nanoscale-size clusters in minerals are described herein, which occur in 42 different mineral species. The topological diversity of POM clusters in minerals is rather restricted compared to the multitude of moieties reported for synthetic compounds, but the lists of synthetic and natural POMs do not overlap completely. The metal–oxo clusters in the crystal structures of the vanarsite-group minerals ([As 3+ V 4+ 2 V 5+ 10 As 5+ 6 O 51 ] 7− ), bouazzerite and whitecapsite ([ M 3+ 3 Fe 7 (AsO 4 ) 9 O 8–; n (OH) n ]), putnisite ([Cr 3+ 8 (OH) 16 (CO 3 ) 8 ] 8− ), and ewingite ([(UO 2 ) 24 (CO 3 ) 30 O 4 (OH) 12 (H 2 O) 8 ] 32− ) contain metal–oxo clusters that have no close chemical or topological analogues in synthetic chemistry. The interesting feature of the POM cluster topologies in minerals is the presence of unusual coordination of metal atoms enforced by the topological restraints imposed upon the cluster geometry (the cubic coordination of Fe 3+ and Ti 4+ ions in arsmirandite and lehmannite, respectively, and the trigonal prismatic coordination of Fe 3+ in bouazzerite and whitecapsite). Complexity analysis indicates that ewingite and morrisonite are the first and the second most structurally complex minerals known so far. The formation of nanoscale clusters can be viewed as one of the leading mechanisms of generating structural complexity in both minerals and synthetic inorganic crystalline compounds. The discovery of POM minerals is one of the specific landmarks of descriptive mineralogy and mineralogical crystallography of our time.",

    "abstract": "Based on the review of the literature results the database of the fusion temperatures of two-component molecular crystals (1947 co-crystals) and individual components thereof was built up. To improve the design of co-crystals with predictable melting temperatures, the correlation equations connecting co-crystals and individual components melting points were deduced. These correlations were discovered for 18 co-crystals of different stoichiometric compositions. The correlation coefficients were analysed, and the conclusions about the main/determinative and slave components of a co-crystal were made. The comparative analysis of the melting points of co-crystals composed from the same components but with different stoichiometry showed a co-crystal melting temperature growth when increasing the content of a high-melting component. The differences in the melting temperatures were determined and discussed for the following: (a) monotropic polymorphic forms, (b) two-component crystals with the same composition and different stoichiometry, and (c) two-component crystals based on racemates and enantiomers. The database analysis revealed the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and co-formers (CFs) more particularly used for co-crystal design. The approach based on an efficacy parameter allowing the prediction of co-crystals with melting points lower than those of individual compounds was developed.",

Recent experiments on high-quality single crystals uncovered the existence of intriguing multi- k magnetic structures, which evolved from zigzag structures.

This can lead to large savings in computational cost without a significant impact on accuracy, as demonstrated in the cases of N -acetyl- para -aminophenol (paracetamol) and methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (methyl paraben). The approach is also applied successfully to two larger molecules, benzyl [4-(4-methyl-5-[(4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)phenyl]carbamate (molecule XX from the fifth CSP blind test) and (2 S )-2-[4-(3-fluorobenzyloxy)benzylamino]propionamide (safinamide), for which we conduct the first reported CSP study. In both cases, the use of torsional groups results in over 99% reduction in computational cost, which enables the generation of an initial CSP landscape with high-quality structures found within the standard cutoff of 20 kJ mol −1 for progression to refinement.",

It is shown that the EZKC provides a better understanding of the structures of these compounds than in previous descriptions. In most of these nitrides, P atoms behave as pseudo-Si atoms and N atoms behave as pseudo-O atoms, so providing a good explanation for the four-connectivity of P atoms forming PN 4 units, which behave as pseudo-SiO 4 units like the SiO 4 units in many polymorphs of SiO 2 . In addition, the EZKC shows that the notation of these compounds as phosphonitrides is more appropriate than as nitridophosphates because N atoms act as the anions in these compounds.",

Selected hydrogen bonds switch over and become bifurcated, whereas the others are compressed continuously. The transition is accompanied by pronounced discontinuities in the cell parameters and volume versus pressure, although no radical changes in the molecular packing are induced. Although, in contrast to DL-alanine, in the crystal structure of the salt there are short O-H···O hydrogen bonds, the structure of the salt is more compressible. At the same time, the structure of DL-alanine does not undergo pressure-induced phase transitions, whereas the structure of DL-alaninium semi-oxalate monohydrate does, and at a relatively low pressure. The anisotropy of lattice strain for the low-pressure phase differs from that on cooling at ambient pressure; interestingly, the anisotropy of the pressure-induced compression of the high-pressure phase is quite similar to the lattice strain of the low-pressure phase on cooling.",

The lattice energy of the molecule was calculated using density functional theory (B3LYP) methods with the 6-31G** basis set. The molecular electrostatic potential of the pyrazinamide molecule exhibits extended electronegative regions around O1, N1 and N2. The existence of a negative electrostatic potential (ESP) region just above the upper and lower surfaces of the pyrazine ring confirm the π-electron cloud.",

    "abstract": "The Distortion Theorem implies that the irregularity of bond distances in a distorted coordination polyhedron causes an increase of mean bond distance. Examination of 40 polyhedra containing the lone-pair cation Te(IV) shows that this does not imply an increase in polyhedral volume. Volumes of these polyhedra are 10.3-23.7 Å(3), compared with the 12.83 Å(3) expected for a hypothetical regular octahedron. There is little correlation between volume and measures of polyhedral distortion such as quadratic elongation, bond-angle variance or vector bond valence. However, the oxygens of our polyhedra lie very close to a sphere of best fit, centred at ~ 1 Å from the Te(IV) atom. The Te(IV)-centre distance is an index of lone-pair stereoactivity and is linearly related to the radius Rsph of the sphere; this is explained by a more localized lone pair repelling the anions more strongly, leading to a longer non-bonded distance between the lone pair and anions. Polyhedral volume still varies considerably for a given Rsph, because the oxygen ligands may be distributed over the whole sphere surface, or confined to a small portion of it. The uniformity of this distribution can be estimated from the distance between the sphere centre and the centroid of the O6 polyhedron. Te(IV)-centre and centroid-centre distances alone then account for 95% of the variation observed in volume for polyhedra which are topologically octahedral. Six of the polyhedra studied that are outliers are closer in shape to pentagonal pyramids than octahedra. These have short distances from the central Te(IV) cation to other Te(IV) and/or to large, polarizable cations, suggesting additional weak bonding interactions between these species and the central lone pair. The flexibility of lone-pair polyhedra is further enhanced by the ability of a single polyhedron to accommodate different cations with different degrees of lone-pair activity, which facilitates more diverse solid solution behaviour than would otherwise be the case.",

Theoretical charge-density calculations have been performed to study the nature and strength associated with the existence of this intermolecular F...O contact, wherein the F atom is attached to an sp 3 -hybridized C atom in the case of A1 and to an sp 2 hybridized carbon in the case of A2. The crystal packing of the former contains two `electronically different' C sp 3 —F...O contacts which are present across and in between the layers of molecules. In the latter case, it is characterized by the presence of a very ` short ' (2.708 Å) and ` highly directional ' (168° at ∠C4—F1...O1 and 174° at ∠C10—O1...F1) C sp 2 —F...O contact. According to the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) study, it is a rare example in molecular crystals. Topological features of F...O contacts in the solid state were compared with the gas-phase models. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional static deformation density obtained from theoretical multipole modeling confirm the presence of a charge depleted region on the F atoms. Minimization of the electrostatic repulsion between like charges are observed through subtle arrangements in the electronic environment in two of the short intermolecular F...O contacts. These contacts were investigated using inputs from pair energy decomposition analysis, Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), Hirshfeld surface analysis, delocalization index, reduced density gradient (RDG) plot, electrostatic potential surface and distributed atomic polarizability. The intermolecular energy decomposition (PIXEL) and RDG–NCI (non-covalent interaction) analysis of the F...O contacts establish the interaction to be dispersive in nature. The mutual polarization of an O atom by fluorine and vice versa provides real physical insights into the role of atomic polarizability in interacting atoms in molecules in crystals.",

Copper minerals are known only from oxidizing-type fumaroles. The most diverse copper mineralization occurs at the Tolbachik volcano (Kamchatka, Russia). Copper minerals from fumarolic systems are subdivided into two genetic groups: Group I are minerals formed in the hot zones of fumaroles (&gt;473 K, mainly 673–973 K) and Group II are minerals formed in the moderately hot zones of fumaroles (&lt;473 K, mainly at 343–423 K). Group I includes 81 mineral species. Their most defining chemical feature is that all of them are hydrogen-free, and many of them contain the additional anion O 2− . In comparison with minerals from other geological environments, in minerals of Group I the Cu 2+ cation exhibits the strongest affinity for four- and fivefold coordinations and the strongest distortion of Cu 2+ -centred octahedra. Group II consists of 15 chlorides and sulfates including 13 H-bearing species. In these minerals the Cu 2+ cation shows affinity for octahedral coordination, with OH − and/or H 2 O 0 as ligands. In terms of crystal chemistry these minerals are closer to supergene minerals rather than to high-temperature fumarolic species. Temperature is the major factor governing the crystal chemistry of Cu 2+ oxysalts and chlorides in low-pressure systems. The defining feature of fumarolic copper mineralization over this whole temperature range is the important role of alkali cations. The available data on complexes of Cu 2+ -centred polyhedra in the structures of natural oxysalts and halides are summarized and reviewed. Isomorphism in copper minerals from volcanic exhalations is discussed. The structures of high-temperature Cu oxysalts with additional O 2− anions ( i.e. O atoms non-bonded to S 6+ , Mo 6+ , As 5+ , V 5+ , Se 4+ or B 3+ ) are also interpreted using an approach based on oxocentred tetrahedra.",

    "abstract": "The main challenge for achieving better energetic materials is to increase their density. In this paper, cocrystals of HNIW (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane, often referred to as CL-20) with TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) were synthesized using ethanol in a green chemical method. The cocrystal was formulated as C 13 H 11 N 15 O 18 and possesses a higher density (1.934 g cm −3 ) than published previously (1.846 g cm −3 ). This high-density cocrystal possesses a new structure, which can be substantiated by the different types of hydrogen bonds. The predominant driving forces that connect HNIW with TNT in the new cocrystal were studied at ambient conditions using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform–infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The results reveal that the structure of the new HNIW/TNT cocrystals consists of three one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded chains exploiting the familiar HNIW–TNT multi-component supramolecular structure, in which two hydrogen-bonded chains are between —NO 2 (HNIW) and —CH (TNT), and one hydrogen-bonded chain is between —CH (HNIW) and —NO 2 (TNT). The changes to the electron binding energy and type of element in the new cocrystal were traced using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Meanwhile, the physicochemical characteristics alter after cocrystallization due to the hydrogen bonding. It was found that the new HNIW/TNT cocrystal is more thermodynamically stable than HNIW. Thermodynamic aspects of new cocrystal decomposition are investigated in order to explain this observation. The detonation velocity of new HNIW/TNT cocrystals is 8631 m s −1 , close to that of HNIW, whereas the mechanical sensitivity is lower than HNIW.",

The solubilities of these salts in pure water (pH 7.0) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at 310 K, with the salts showing considerably greater solubility than ciprofloxacin itself and, interestingly, ciprofloxacin/fumaric acid (2:1) being more soluble than ciprofloxacin/fumaric acid (1:1). Intrigued by this phenomenon, we undertook a comparison of the crystal structures of the salts: the three-dimensional sandwich-like structure observed in the 2:1 salt indicates that the preferred stacking may be a factor in increasing the solubility of ciprofloxacin.",

A graph-theoretical description of the structures rationalizes and gives further support to the conclusions obtained via the CHARDI approach.",

A detailed comprehensive analysis of the crystal packing in terms of the associated intermolecular interactions and a quantification of their interaction energies have been performed for both forms of the two different organic salts (A and B) using X-ray crystallography and computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanical calculations, PIXEL lattice-energy calculations (with decomposition of total lattice energy into the Coulombic, polarization, dispersion and repulsion contribution), the calculation of the Madelung constant (the EUGEN method), Hirshfeld and two-dimensional fingerprint plots. The presence of ionic [N-H](+)···Cl(-) and [C-H](+)···Cl(-) hydrogen bonds mainly stabilizes the crystal packing in both forms A and B, while in the case of B·H2O [N-H](+)···O(water) and O(water)-H···Cl(-) hydrogen bonds along with [N-H](+)···Cl(-) and [C-H](+)···Cl(-) provide stability to the crystal packing. The lattice-energy calculations from both PIXEL and EUGEN methods revealed that in the case of A, form (I) (monoclinic) is more stable whereas for B it is the anhydrous form that is more stable. The analysis of the `Madelung mode' of crystal packing of two forms of A and B and its hydrates suggest that differences exist in the position of the charged ions/atoms in the organic solid state. The R/E (distance-energy) plots for all the crystal structures show that the molecular pairs in their crystal packing are connected with either highly stabilizing (due to the presence of organic R(+) and Cl(-)) or highly destabilizing Coulombic contacts. The difference in crystal packing and associated intermolecular interactions between polymorphs (in the case of A) or the hydrates (in the case of B) have been clearly elucidated by the analysis of Hirshfeld surfaces and two-dimensional fingerprint plots. The relative contributions of the various interactions to the Hirshfeld surface for the cationic (dihydropyrimidinium) part and anionic (chloride ion) part for the two forms of A and B and its hydrate were observed to be different.",

Smooth temperature-dependent changes of the atomic coordinates become discontinuous with the phase transition. Our observations imply that the cations remain off-center even in the high-temperature cubic phase.

Here, machine learning is used to predict the average displacement of octahedral cations from its high-symmetry position in ferroelectric perovskites. Published octahedral cation displacements data from density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to train machine learning models, where each cation is represented by features such as Pauling electronegativity, Martynov-Batsanov electronegativity and the ratio of valence electron number to nominal charge. Average displacements for ten new octahedral cations for which DFT data do not exist are predicted. Predictions are validated by comparing them with new DFT calculations and existing experimental data.

In contrast, a model featuring partial H for Ca substitution and the inversion of P1O4 tetrahedra, adopted from the whitlockite structure, allowed for a refinement with minimal misfits and was corroborated by HPO42- absorptions in Fourier-transform IR spectra. The Ca/P ratio converged to 1.443 ± 0.003 (n = 36), independently of synthesis conditions. As a quantitative verification, the platelets were thermally decomposed into hydrogen-free β-TCP and β-calcium pyrophosphate which resulted in a global Ca/P ratio in close agreement with the initial β-TCP Ca/P ratio (ΔCa/P = 0.003) and with the chemical composition measured by inductively coupled plasma (ΔCa/P = 0.003). These findings thus describe for the first time a hydrogen-substituted β-TCP structure, i.e. a Mg-free whitlockite, represented by the formula Ca21 - x(HPO4)2x(PO4)14 - 2x, where x = 0.80 ± 0.04, and may have implications for resorption properties of bone regenerative materials.",

The residual density attributable to a stereochemically-active lone pair of electrons of bismuth was prominent at approximately the centre of a larger cap of BiO 8 square antiprisms, that is on the line from the Bi sites to an adjacent WO 4 2− slab along the b -axis direction. Quite uneven Bi—O distances and the formation of a vacant coordination hemisphere (within 3 Å) should, therefore, be ascribed to the strong demand of bismuth to form shorter Bi—O bonds to use up its electrostatic charge within its coordination environment. The shift of bismuth along − c propagates via the correlated shift of the W site and these cooperative shifts cause ferroelectricity in the compound. This propagation was easily effected by the intrusion of molecules such as acetone into the structure.",

    "abstract": "Quantum theory of atoms in molecules and the orbital-free density functional theory (DFT) are combined in this work to study the spatial distribution of electrostatic and quantum electronic forces acting in stable crystals. The electron distribution is determined by electrostatic electron mutual repulsion corrected for exchange and correlation, their attraction to nuclei and by electron kinetic energy. The latter defines the spread of permissible variations in the electron momentum resulting from the de Broglie relationship and uncertainty principle, as far as the limitations of Pauli principle and the presence of atomic nuclei and other electrons allow. All forces are expressed via kinetic and DFT potentials and then defined in terms of the experimental electron density and its derivatives; hence, this approach may be considered as orbital-free quantum crystallography. The net force acting on an electron in a crystal at equilibrium is zero everywhere, presenting a balance of the kinetic Fkin(r) and potential forces F(r). The critical points of both potentials are analyzed and they are recognized as the points at which forces Fkin(r) and F(r) individually are zero (the Lagrange points). The positions of these points in a crystal are described according to Wyckoff notations, while their types depend on the considered scalar field. It was found that F(r) force pushes electrons to the atomic nuclei, while the kinetic force Fkin(r) draws electrons from nuclei. This favors formation of electron concentration bridges between some of the nearest atoms. However, in a crystal at equilibrium, only kinetic potential vkin(r) and corresponding force exhibit the electronic shells and atomic-like zero-flux basins around the nuclear attractors. The force-field approach and quantum topological theory of atoms in molecules are compared and their distinctions are clarified.",

    "abstract": "Bone is a complex hierarchical biomineralized material, which is special amongst biominerals because it is replete with cells, namely, osteocytes. While bone has been scrutinized for centuries, many questions remain open and new research hints that the ultrastructure of bone, encompassing both the bone matrix itself and the embedded cell network, is much more heterogeneous than hitherto realized. A number of these new findings have been made thanks to the enormous developments in X-ray imaging that have occurred in recent decades, and there is promise that they will also allow many of the remaining open questions to be addressed. X-ray absorption or phase imaging affords high three-dimensional (3D) resolution and allows traversing the length scales of bone all the way down to the fine details of the lacuno-canalicular network housing the osteocytes. Multimodal X-ray imaging provides combined information covering both the length scales defined by the size of the measured volume and tomographic resolution, as well as those probed by the signal that is measured. In X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT), for example, diffraction signals can be reconstructed tomographically, which offers detailed information about the spatial variations in the crystallographic properties of the bone biomineral. Orientational information can be obtained by tensor tomography. The combination of both small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) tensor tomography gives information on the orientation of bone nanostructure and crystals, respectively. These new technical developments promise that great strides towards understanding bone structure can be expected in the near future. In this review, recent findings that have resulted from X-ray imaging are highlighted and speculation is given on what can be expected to follow.",

This leads to a clear view of the transformation sequence, as follows. Hexagonal YMnO3 is paraelectric in P63/mmc at elevated temperatures, and undergoes a single structural transition on cooling through 1250 K to a ferrielectric phase in P63cm that is retained through room temperature. At a much lower temperature, 70 K, there is a magnetic transition from paramagnetic to a triangular antiferromagnetic arrangement, most likely with symmetry P63'cm'.

The results revealed that docking and scoring using the QPLD–GBSA procedure outperformed the remaining scoring functions in the majority of instances.

    "abstract": "The Source Function (SF), introduced in 1998 by Richard Bader and Carlo Gatti, is succinctly reviewed and a number of paradigmatic applications to in vacuo and crystal systems are illustrated to exemplify how the SF may be used to discuss chemical bonding in both conventional and highly challenging cases. The SF enables the electron density to be seen at a point determined by source contributions from the atoms or a group of atoms of a system, and it is therefore well linked to the chemist's awareness that any local property and chemical behaviour is to some degree influenced by all the remaining parts of a system. The key and captivating feature of the SF is that its evaluation requires only knowledge of the electron density (ED) of a system, thereby enabling a comparison of ab initio and X-ray diffraction derived electron density properties on a common and rigorous basis. The capability of the SF to detect electron-delocalization effects and to quantify their degree of transferability is systematically explored in this paper through the analysis and comparison of experimentally X-ray derived Source Function patterns in benzene, naphthalene and (±)-8′-benzhydrylideneamino-1,1′-binaphthyl-2-ol (BAB) molecular crystals. It is shown that the SF tool recovers the characteristic SF percentage patterns caused by π-electron conjugation in the first two paradigmatic aromatic molecules in almost perfect quantitative agreement with those obtained from ab initio periodic calculations. Moreover, the effect of chemical substitution on the degree of transferability of such patterns to the benzene- and naphthalene-like moieties of BAB is neatly shown and quantified by the observed systematic deviations, relative to benzene and naphthalene, of only those SF contributions from the substituted C atoms. Finally, the capability of the SF to reveal electron-delocalization effects is challenged by using a promolecule density, rather than the proper quantum mechanical density, to determine the changes in SF patterns along the cyclohexene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene and benzene molecule series. It is shown that, differently from the proper quantum density, the promolecular density is unable to reproduce the SF trends anticipated by the increase of electron delocalization along the series, therefore ruling out the geometrical effect as being the only cause for the observed SF patterns changes.",

The systematic deviation of the bond valence from the expected value is observed in the long-range structure, and is discussed from geometric and algebraic viewpoints. In the valence-length diagram, such a deviation arises from discrepancies between the intersection points of the long-range bond valences and the theoretical bond valences with the valence-length curves of involved cations. Three factors cause systematic errors in the bond valences: difference in atomic valences, bond valence parameters Ri (the length of a bond of unit valence) and bond valence parameters bi (the bond softness) between the involved cations over the same crystallographic site. One important consequence strictly related to the systematic errors is that they lead to erroneous bond strain values for mixed occupancy sites indicating underbonding or overbonding that actually does not exist.",

The polymorphic transformation from P 3 2 21 (low- T , α quartz) to P 6 2 22 (high- T , β quartz) occurs at a transition temperature, T tr = 847 K. The T variations of spontaneous strains and several structural parameters are fitted to an order parameter, Q , using Landau theory. The change in Si atom coordinate, Si x , gives T tr − T c = 0.49 K, which indicates an α ↔ β transition that is weakly first order and nearly tricritical in character ( Q 4 ∝ T ). Strains give higher T tr − T c values (≃ 7 K). Other fitted parameters are the oxygen O z coordinate, Si—Si distance, Si—O—Si and φ angles, and intensity of the (111) reflection, I 111 . In α quartz, the Si—Si distance increases with T because of cation repulsion, so the Si—O—Si angle increases (and φ decreases) and causes the thermal expansion of the framework structure that consists of corner-sharing distorted rigid SiO 4 tetrahedra. The Si—Si distances contract with T and cause negative thermal expansion (NTE) in β quartz because of increasing thermal librations of the O atom in the Si—O—Si linkage that occur nearly perpendicular to the Si—Si contraction. In calcite, CaCO 3 , the short Ca—Ca distance expands with T , but the next-nearest Ca—Ca distance, which is of equal length to the a axis, contracts with T and causes NTE along the a axis. The thermal librations of the atoms in the rigid CO 3 group increase with T along the c axis.",

C=Se acceptors are in many respects similar to C=S acceptors, with similar vdW-normalized hydrogen-bond lengths and calculated interaction strengths.

    "abstract": "An experimental charge density distribution of 2-nitroimidazole was determined from high-resolution X-ray diffraction and the Hansen-Coppens multipole model. The 2-nitroimidazole compound was crystallized and a high-angle X-ray diffraction intensity data set has been collected at low temperature (110 K). The structure was solved and further, an aspherical multipole model refinement was performed up to octapole level; the results were used to determine the structure, bond topological and electrostatic properties of the molecule. In the crystal, the molecule exhibits a planar structure and forms weak and strong intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the neighbouring molecules. The Hirshfeld surface of the molecule was plotted, which explores different types of intermolecular interactions and their strength. The topological analysis of electron density at the bond critical points (b.c.p.) of the molecule was performed, from that the electron density ρbcp(r) and the Laplacian of electron density ∇2ρbcp(r) at the b.c.p.s of the molecule have been determined; these parameters show the charge concentration/depletion of the nitroimidazole bonds in the crystal. The electrostatic parameters like atomic charges and the dipole moment of the molecule were calculated. The electrostatic potential surface of the molecule has been plotted, and it displays a large electronegative region around the nitro group. All the experimental results were compared with the corresponding theoretical calculations performed using CRYSTAL09.",

In many cases the degree of cation ordering can be varied by suitable synthesis conditions or subsequent sample treatment, which has a fundamental impact on the physical properties of such compounds. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of cation order–disorder phase transition and estimation of the phase transition temperature is of paramount importance for tuning of properties of such double perovskites. In this work, based on the earlier proposed cation–anion elastic bonds model, a theory of order–disorder phase transitions of B -cations in AB ′ 1/2 B ′′ 1/2 O 3 perovskites is presented, which allows reliable estimation of the phase transition temperatures and of the reduced lattice constants of such double perovskites.",

The charge density analysis provides experimental confirmation of the partially localized π-bonding suggested by the conventional structural formula, but the evidence for any significant C-N π bonding is not strong. Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) gives H atom positional and anisotropic displacement parameters that agree very well with the neutron parameters.

There is an urgent need to obtain new solid forms of higher solubility to improve the bioavailability of the API (active pharmaceutical ingredient). In this context, cocrystals with urea, succinic acid, and glutaric acid and salts with maleic acid, adipic acid, and saccharin were prepared via wet granulation and solution crystallizations. Crystal structures of the free base ( Z ′ = 2), cocrystals of erlotinib–urea (1:1), erlotinib–succinic acid monohydrate (1:1:1), erlotinib–glutaric acid monohydrate (1:1:1) and salts of erlotinib–adipic acid adipate (1:0.5:0.5) are determined and their hydrogen-bonding patterns are analyzed. Self recognition via the (amine) N—H...N (pyridine) hydrogen bond between the API molecules is replaced by several heterosynthons such as acid–pyridine, amide–pyridine and carboxylate–pyridinium in the new binary systems. Auxiliary interactions play an important role in determining the conformation of the API in the crystal. FT–IR spectroscopy is used to distinguish between the salts and cocrystals in the new multi-component systems. The new solid forms are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to confirm their unique phase identity.",

The total electronic energy is decomposed into electrostatic, exchange, Weizsacker and Pauli components on the basis of physically grounded arguments. Then, the one-electron Euler equation is re-written through corresponding potentials, which have clear physical and chemical meaning. Partial electron densities related with these potentials by the Poisson equation are also defined. All these functions were analyzed from viewpoint of their physical content and limits of applicability. Then, they were expressed in terms of experimental electron density and its derivatives using the orbital-free density functional theory approximations, and applied to the study of chemical bonding in a heteromolecular crystal of ammonium hydrooxalate oxalic acid dihydrate. It is demonstrated that this approach allows the electron density to be decomposed into physically meaningful components associated with electrostatics, exchange, and spin-independent wave properties of electrons or with their combinations in a crystal. Therefore, the bonding information about a crystal that was previously unavailable for X-ray diffraction analysis can be now obtained.",

    "abstract": "A new Pb-II coordination complex [PbL(OAc)], which was readily synthesized from a mixture of Pb(OAc)(2)center dot 3H(2)O and 1-(pyridin-2-yl)benzylidene-4-phenyl-thiosemicarbazide (HL) is reported. The crystal structure analysis of [PbL(OAc)] showed that the Pb-II cation is N,N',S-chelated by the tridentate pincer-type ligand L and by the oxygen atoms of the acetate anion. In addition, the metal centre forms Pb center dot center dot center dot O and Pb center dot center dot center dot S tetrel bonds with an adjacent complex molecule, yielding a 1D zigzag polymeric chain, which is reinforced by N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds and pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. These chains are interlinked by C-H center dot center dot center dot py non-covalent interactions, realized between one of the acetate hydrogen atoms and the pyridine rings. According to the Hirshfeld surface analysis, the crystal packing is mainly characterized by intermolecular H center dot center dot center dot H, H center dot center dot center dot C and H center dot center dot center dot O contacts, followed by H center dot center dot center dot N, H center dot center dot center dot S, C center dot center dot center dot C, C center dot center dot center dot N, Pb center dot center dot center dot H, Pb center dot center dot center dot O and Pb center dot center dot center dot S contacts. The FTIR and H-1 NMR spectra of [PbL(OAc)] testify to the deprotonation of the parent ligand HL, while the acetate ligand exhibits an anisobidentate coordination mode as established by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy. Lastly, theoretical calculations at the PBEO-D3/def2-TZVP level of theory have been used to analyze and characterize the Pb center dot center dot center dot O and Pb center dot center dot center dot S tetrel bonds observed in the crystal of [PbL(OAc)], using a combination of QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and NCIPlot (Non-Covalent Interaction Plot) computational tools.",

There are systematic features in the electron density obtained from all data sets which agree with higher level benchmark calculations, but there are also many other strong systematic features which disagree with the reference calculations, most notably those associated with the electron density near the nuclei. To enhance reproducibility, three new protocols are described and tested to address the halting problem of XCW fitting, namely: an empirical power-function method, which is useful for estimating the accuracy of the structure factor uncertainties; an asymptotic extrapolation method based on ideas from density functional theory; and a `conservative method' whereby the smallest value of the regularization parameter is chosen from a series of data sets, or subsets.",

For HTB, there is one obvious tilting pattern, leading to a structure in space group P6₃/mmc. This differs from the space group P6₃/mcm frequently quoted from X-ray studies – these studies have in effect detected only displacements of the W cations from the centres of the WO6 octahedra. The correct space group, taking account of both W ion displacement and the octahedral tilting, is P6₃22 – structures in this space group and matching this description have been reported. A second acceptable tilting pattern has been found, leading to a structure in P6/mmm but on a larger '2 × 2 × 2' unit cell – however, no observations of this structure have been reported. For TTB, a search at the special points of the Brillouin zones revealed only one comparable tilting pattern, in a structure with space-group symmetry I4/m on a '2(1/2) × 2(1/2) by 2' unit cell. Given several literature reports of larger unit cells for TTB, we conducted a limited search along the lines of symmetry and found structures with acceptable tilt patterns in Bbmm on a '2(1/2)2 × 2(1/2) × 2' unit cell.

    "abstract": "The experimental charge density analysis of the anti-hyperglycemic agent metformin chloride with high-resolution X-ray diffraction data at low temperature (100 K) has been performed and these experimental results were compared with that derived from the corresponding periodic theoretical calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory. The experimental and theoretical multipolar charge-density analyses of metformin chloride have been accomplished in order to understand its structural and electronic properties. The C and N atoms of the molecular backbone adopt a near trigonal geometry due to the occurrence of extensive delocalization/resonance of C—N bonds, as confirmed by topological analysis and also found by Natural Resonance Theory calculations performed in the isolated metformin cation. The molecule contains six C—N bonds and the topological bond order analysis shows that four bonds have bond orders close to 4/3 and two bonds can be considered as single. The analysis of numerical parameters of the valence shell charge concentration reports that the N3 atom, which forms two bonds with C atoms, possesses one non-bonding valence-shell charge concentration (VSCC) in the direction of the electron lone pair. Among the intermolecular interactions of the chloride atom with the H—C and H—N atoms, eight have been found to be shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii. The analysis of contacts on the Hirshfeld surface reveals that the H—N...Cl hydrogen bonds are enriched (over-represented) and act as the driving force in the crystal packing formation. The metformin cations form favorable electrostatic interactions with the chloride anions which have globally a stronger energy than the unfavorable cation/cation interactions.",

    "abstract": "A multi-temperature structural study of Mg 2Si and Mg 2Sn was carried out from 100 to 700K using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. The temperature dependence of the lattice parameters can be expressed as a = 6.3272(4) + 6.5(2) × 10 -5T + 4.0(3) × 10 -8T 2Å and a = 6.7323(7) + 8.5(4) × 10 -5T + 3.8(5) × 10 -8T 2Å for Mg 2Si and Mg 2Sn, respectively. The atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) are reported and analysed using a Debye model for the averaged U iso giving Debye temperatures of 425(2)K for Mg 2Si and 243(2)K for Mg 2Sn. The ADPs are considerably smaller for Mg 2Si than for Mg 2Sn reflecting the weaker chemical bonding in the Mg 2Sn structure. Following the heating, an annealing effect is observed on the lattice parameters and peak widths in both structures, presumably due to changes in the crystal defects, but the lattice thermal expansion is almost unchanged by the annealing. This work provides accurate structural parameters which are of importance for studies of Mg 2Si, Mg 2Sn and their solid solutions.Accurate structural parameters of Mg 2Si and Mg 2Sn are reported. They are useful for studying these promising thermoelectric materials and their solid solutions.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most important phenomena in crystallization, the crystal nucleation process has always been the focus of research. In this work, influences of pre-assembly species and the desolvation process on the crystal nucleation process were studied. p-Nitrobenzoic acid (PNBA) was taken as a model compound to investigate the relationship between solution chemistry and nucleation kinetics in seven different solvents. One unsolvated form and four solvates of PNBA were obtained and one of the solvates was newly discovered. The nucleation behaviours and nucleation kinetics of PNBA in the seven solvents were studied and analyzed. Density functional theory (DFT) and solvation energy calculation were adopted to evaluate the strength of solute-solvent interactions. Vibrational spectroscopy combined with molecular simulation was applied to reveal the pre-assembly species in the solution. Based on these results, a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between molecular structure, crystal structure, solution chemistry and nucleation dynamics was proposed and discussed. It was found that the structural similarity between solution chemistry and crystal structure, the interaction between specific sites and the overall strength of solvation will jointly affect the nucleation process.",

Parameterization is performed against a set of 186 experimentally determined, low-temperature crystal structures and 53 measured sublimation enthalpies of hydrogen-bonding organic molecules. The resulting force fields are tested on a validation set of 129 crystal structures and show improved reproduction of the structures and lattice energies of a range of organic molecular crystals compared with the original force field with atomic partial charge electrostatics. Unit-cell dimensions of the validation set are typically reproduced to within 3% with the re-parameterized force fields. Lattice energies, which were all included during parameterization, are systematically underestimated when compared with measured sublimation enthalpies, with mean absolute errors of between 7.4 and 9.0%.",

The results indicate that the occurrence of high conductivity in K9H7(SO4)8·H2O crystals with a temperature increase is associated with the outward diffusion of water molecules, hydrogen-bond network rearrangement and the formation of channels for the possible motion of K(+) ions. A rearranged system of hydrogen bonds consists of permanent bonds and partly of dynamically disordered bonds.

At high temperatures ( T &gt; 500 K), the aristotype phase β-Zn 2 P 2 O 7 ( C 2/ m , Z = 2, a ≃ 6.60, b ≃ 8.28, c ≃ 4.53 Å, β ≃ 105.4°) is stable.

Between the stability ranges of the α 1 - and β-phases exists the intermediate, incommensurately modulated α 2 -Zn 2 P 2 O 7 phase with modulation wavevector q ≃ (0.33, 0, 0.40) and C 2/ m (α, 0, γ)0 s superspace group symmetry. The α 1 → α 2 lock-in phase transition at T L = 408 K is of first-order and features virtually no hysteresis. It is immediately followed by the second-order α 2 → β transition to the non-modulated phase at T I ≃ 430 K. This transformation is sluggish and even at T = 500 K very weak satellite reflections of the α 2 -phase were observed. Both phase transitions were analyzed with differential scanning calorimetry and high-temperature powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structures of the α 1 - and α 2 -phases were refined from single crystal data collected at T = 350, 400, 405, 410, 415, 420, 425, 430, 450 and 500 K. Different models describing the slow transition from the incommensurately modulated α 2 - to the non-modulated β-phase were tested. In the model resulting in the best residuals, the bridging O atom of the [P 2 O 7 ] group, which is located on a 2/ m position in the basic structure, is described as an overlap of an atom ordered in internal space and one atom disordered around the mirror plane. The occupancy of the ordered atom decreases with temperature until at T = 500 K virtually only the disordered atom remains. Simultaneously, the amplitude of the modulation functions of the remaining atoms decreases, so that the T = 500 K structure can be considered as the C 2/ m aristotype structure, although the diffraction pattern still features satellite reflections of first order with very low intensities.",

    "abstract": "We have collected neutron powder diffraction data from MgSO 4 ·11D 2 O (the deuterated analogue of meridianiite), a highly hydrated sulfate salt that is thought to be a candidate rock-forming mineral in some icy satellites of the outer solar system. Our measurements, made using the PEARL/HiPr and OSIRIS instruments at the ISIS neutron spallation source, covered the range 0.1 &lt; P &lt; 800 MPa and 150 &lt; T &lt; 280 K. The refined unit-cell volumes as a function of P and T are parameterized in the form of a Murnaghan integrated linear equation of state having a zero-pressure volume V 0 = 706.23 (8) Å 3 , zero-pressure bulk modulus K 0 = 19.9 (4) GPa and its first pressure derivative, K ′ = 9 (1). The structure's compressibility is highly anisotropic, as expected, with the three principal directions of the unit-strain tensor having compressibilities of 9.6 × 10 −3 , 3.4 × 10 −2 and 3.4 × 10 −3 GPa −1 , the most compressible direction being perpendicular to the long axis of a discrete hexadecameric water cluster, (D 2 O) 16 . At high pressure we observed two different phase transitions. First, warming of MgSO 4 ·11D 2 O at 545 MPa resulted in a change in the diffraction pattern at 275 K consistent with partial (peritectic) melting; quasielastic neutron spectra collected simultaneously evince the onset of the reorientational motion of D 2 O molecules with characteristic time-scales of 20–30 ps, longer than those found in bulk liquid water at the same temperature and commensurate with the lifetime of solvent-separated ion pairs in aqueous MgSO 4 . Second, at ∼ 0.9 GPa, 240 K, MgSO 4 ·11D 2 O decomposed into high-pressure water ice phase VI and MgSO 4 ·9D 2 O, a recently discovered phase that has hitherto only been formed at ambient pressure by quenching small droplets of MgSO 4 (aq) in liquid nitrogen. The fate of the high-pressure enneahydrate on further compression and warming is not clear from the neutron diffraction data, but its occurrence indicates that it may also be a rock-forming mineral in the deep mantles of large icy satellites.",

Here, XB soft–soft complementarity is investigated with a bidentate receptor that shows similar associations with neutral carbonyls and heavy chalcogen analogs.

    "abstract": "The microstructure evolution and changes in the structures of crystal defects of the nanocrystalline WC-Co composite in the process of uniaxial compression were studied by simulations at both room and high temperatures. The deformation processes were demonstrated as a function of stress and temperature for the stages prior to and after yielding of the composite. The Peierls stresses were evaluated for Co and WC dislocations with increasing temperature. The deformation mechanisms for each stage of the stress-strain curve were disclosed, in which the effect of temperature was clarified. It was found that with the increase of stress, from elastic deformation to plastic deformation then to yielding of the composite, the dominant mechanisms are grain boundary migration, formation and motion of dislocations in Co, concurrent motion and reaction of dislocations in Co and WC, and then rotation of WC grains in combination with motion of Co and WC dislocations. At the yielding stage, sliding of WC grain boundaries plays an increasingly important role in the contribution to plastic deformation at high temperatures. With strain the proportion of mobile dislocations decreases, and dislocations pile up at triple junctions of WC grains, WC/WC grain boundaries and WC/Co phase boundaries in priority order, leading to the nucleation and propagation of microcracks in these regions.",

Rietveld refinement was used to determine the unit-cell parameters, fractional coordinates and isotropic atomic displacement parameters (Uiso) of the tridymite and cristobalite.

Hirshfeld surface analysis revealed that the dominant intermolecular interactions are of types H...F and F...O, which are likely to be responsible for the packing of the molecules in a non-centrosymmetric structure. Irradiation with blue light leads to the formation of Ru–ON (metastable state MS1) and Ru–η 2 -(NO) (metastable state MS2) bond isomers, as shown by IR and UV–Vis spectroscopy. The structural features of the MS1 isomer were elucidated by photocrystallography. The complex exhibits exceptionally good thermal stability of the metastable state MS1, such that it can be populated by light at 290–300 K, which is important for potential applications. The second harmonic (SH) emission can be generated by femtosecond-pulsed irradiation of the complex. The generated SH is rather efficient and stable under long-term exposure. Finally, since both metastable states and harmonic generation can be generated at room temperature, an attempt to drive the SH response by photoisomerization of the nitrosyl ligand was made and is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Perovskite-type oxide materials (nominal composition ABO3) are a very versatile class of materials, and their properties are tuneable by varying and doping A- and B-site cations. When the B-site contains easily reducible cations (e.g. Fe, Co or Ni), these can exsolve under reducing conditions and form metallic nanoparticles on the surface. This process is very interesting as a novel route for the preparation of catalysts, since oxide surfaces decorated with finely dispersed catalytically active (often metallic) nanoparticles are a key requirement for excellent catalyst performance. Five doped perovskites, namely, La0.9Ca0.1FeO3-δ, La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ, Nd0.9Ca0.1FeO3-δ, Nd0.6Ca0.4FeO3-δ and Nd0.6Ca0.4Fe0.9Co0.1O3-δ, have been synthesized and characterized by experimental and theoretical methods with respect to their crystal structures, electronic properties, morphology and exsolution behaviour. All are capable of exsolving Fe and/or Co. Special emphasis has been placed on the influence of the A-site elemental composition on structure and exsolution capability. Using Nd instead of La increased structural distortions and, at the same time, hindered exsolution. Increasing the amount of Ca doping also increased distortions and additionally changed the Fe oxidation states, resulting in exsolution being shifted to higher temperatures as well. Using the easily reducible element Co as the B-site dopant significantly facilitated the exsolution process and led to much smaller and homogeneously distributed exsolved particles. Therefore, the Co-doped perovskite is a promising material for applications in catalysis, even more so as Co is catalytically a highly active element.

The CSD Python API is used to extract 6201 crystal structures determined close to room temperature and at least one lower temperature down to 90 K. The data set is dominated by structure families with only two temperature points and is subject to various sources of error, including incorrect temperature reporting and missing flags for variable-pressure studies. For structure families comprising four or more temperature points in the range 90-300 K, a linear relationship between unit-cell volume and temperature is shown to be a reasonable approximation. For a selected subset of 210 structures showing an optimal linear fit, the volumetric expansion coefficient at 298 K has mean 173 p.p.m. K",

To analyze the migration paths of sodium cations in these structures, the Voronoi method was used. The parental eudialyte-type MT framework is formed by isolated Z O 6 octahedra, six-membered [ M (1) 6 O 24 ] rings of edge-sharing M (1)O 6 octahedra, and two kinds of rings of tetrahedra, [Si 3 O 9 ] and [Si 9 O 27 ]. Different occupancies of M (2), M (3) and M (4) sites with variable coordination numbers by the additional Q , T * and M * cations, respectively, result in 12 different types of the MT framework. Based on the results of natural tilings calculations as well as theoretical analysis of migration paths, it is found that Na + ions can migrate through six- and seven-membered rings, while all other rings are too small for the migration. In eight types of MT frameworks, Na + -ion migration and diffusion is possible at ambient temperature and pressure, while in four other types cages are connected by narrow windows and, as a result, the Na + diffusion in them is complicated at ambient conditions because of the window diameter, but may be possible either at higher temperatures or under mild geological conditions for long periods of time.",

The solvents that form the solvates are acetonitrile, nitromethane and nitroethane (2:1 and 1:1). It was found that all the solvates lose the solvent molecules from the crystal lattice between 343 and 383 K, and that the melting point of the desolvated materials matched the melting point of the solvent-free GF (493 K). The conformation of the GF molecule in solvent-free form was found to be significantly different from the conformations found in the solvates. Solution stability studies revealed that the GF–acetonitrile solvate transforms to GF and that GF–nitroethane (1:1) solvate transforms to GF–nitroethane (2:1) solvate. On the other hand, GF–nitromethane and GF–nitroethane (2:1) solvates were found to be stable in solution. Our results highlight the importance of the co-crystallization technique in the pharmaceutical drug development; it not only expands the solid form diversity but also creates new avenues for unraveling novel solvates.",

The study of the hydrogen bonds by Raman spectroscopy shows the existence of two main kinds of hydrogen bonds in the crystal, in agreement with the structure obtained by diffraction. The glacial state resulting from an abortive crystallization is composed of microcrystallites of the stable phase coexisting with non-transformed supercooled liquid.

    "abstract": "Since being discovered initially in mixed-cation systems, a method of forming end-member MgSO 4 ·9H 2 O has been found. We have obtained powder diffraction data from protonated analogues (using X-rays) and deuterated analogues (using neutrons) of this compound over a range of temperatures and pressures. From these data we have determined the crystal structure, including all hydrogen positions, the thermal expansion over the range 9–260 K at ambient pressure, the incompressibility over the range 0–1.1 GPa at 240 K and studied the transitions to other stable and metastable phases. MgSO 4 ·9D 2 O is monoclinic, space group P 2 1 / c , Z = 4, with unit-cell parameters at 9 K, a = 6.72764 (6), b = 11.91154 (9), c = 14.6424 (1) Å, β = 95.2046 (7)° and V = 1168.55 (1) Å 3 . The structure consists of two symmetry-inequivalent Mg(D 2 O) 6 octahedra on sites of \\bar 1 symmetry. These are directly joined by a water–water hydrogen bond to form chains of octahedra parallel with the b axis at a = 0. Three interstitial water molecules bridge the Mg(D 2 O) 6 octahedra to the SO 4 2− tetrahedral oxyanion. These tetrahedra sit at a ≃ 0.5 and are linked by two of the three interstitial water molecules in a pentagonal motif to form ribbons parallel with b . The temperature dependences of the lattice parameters from 9 to 260 K have been fitted with a modified Einstein oscillator model, which was used to obtain the coefficients of the thermal expansion tensor. The volume thermal expansion coefficient, α V , is substantially larger than that of either MgSO 4 ·7D 2 O (epsomite) or MgSO 4 ·11D 2 O (meridianiite), being ∼ 110 × 10 −6 K −1 at 240 K. Fitting to a Murnaghan integrated linear equation of state gave a zero-pressure bulk modulus for MgSO 4 ·9D 2 O at 240 K, K 0 = 19.5 (3) GPa, with the first pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, K ′ = 3.8 (4). The bulk modulus is virtually identical to meridianiite and only ∼ 14% smaller than that of epsomite. Above ∼ 1 GPa at 240 K the bulk modulus begins to decrease with pressure; this elastic softening may indicate a phase transition at a pressure above ∼ 2 GPa. Synthesis of MgSO 4 ·9H 2 O from cation-pure aqueous solutions requires quench-freezing of small droplets, a situation that may be relevant to spraying of MgSO 4 -rich cryomagmas into the surface environments of icy satellites in the outer solar system. However, serendipitously, we obtained a mixture of MgSO 4 ·9H 2 O, mirabilite (Na 2 SO 4 ·10H 2 O) and ice by simply leaving a bottle of mid-winter brine from Spotted Lake (Mg/Na ratio = 3), British Columbia, in a domestic freezer for a few hours. This suggests that MgSO 4 ·9H 2 O can occur naturally – albeit on a transient basis – in certain terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments.",

In ferroelectrics, charge is strongly influenced by lattice and vice versa , leading to a range of interesting temperature-dependent physical properties. However, experimental determination of charge in ferroelectrics is challenging because of the formation of ferroelectric domains. Demonstrated here is the scanning convergent-beam electron diffraction (SCBED) technique that can be simultaneously used for imaging ferroelectric domains and identifying crystal symmetry and its fluctuations. Results from SCBED confirm the acentric tetragonal, orthorhombic and rhombohedral symmetry for the ferroelectric phases of BaTiO 3 . However, the symmetry is not homogeneous; regions of a few tens of nanometres retaining almost perfect symmetry are interspersed in regions of lower symmetry. While the observed highest symmetry is consistent with the displacive model of ferroelectric phase transitions in BaTiO 3 , the observed nanoscale symmetry fluctuations are consistent with the predictions of the order–disorder phase-transition mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Direct determination of the Flack parameter as part of the structure refinement procedure usually gives different, though similar, values to post-refinement methods. The source of this discrepancy has been probed by analysing a range of data sets taken from the recent literature. Most significantly, it was observed that the directly refined Flack (x) parameter and its standard uncertainty are usually not much influenced by changes in the refinement weighting schemes, but if they are then there are probably problems with the data or model. Post-refinement analyses give Flack parameters strongly influenced by the choice of weights. Weights derived from those used in the main least squares lead to post-refinement estimates of the Flack parameters and their standard uncertainties very similar to those obtained by direct refinement. Weights derived from the variances of the observed structure amplitudes are more appropriate and often yield post-refinement Flack parameters similar to those from direct refinement, but always with lower standard uncertainties. Substantial disagreement between direct and post-refinement determinations are strongly indicative of problems with the data, which may be difficult to identify. Examples drawn from 28 structure determinations are provided showing a range of different underlying problems. It seems likely that post-refinement methods taking into account the slope of the normal probability plot are currently the most robust estimators of absolute structure and should be reported along with the directly refined values.",

The entire search space of the relevant molecule's conformations is initially evaluated using a coarse, low accuracy grid. Additional LAM points are then placed at appropriate points determined via an automated process, aiming to minimize the computational effort expended in high-energy regions whilst maximizing the accuracy in low-energy regions. As the size, complexity and flexibility of molecules increase, the reduction in computational cost becomes marked. This improvement is illustrated with energy calculations for benzoic acid and the ROY molecule, and a CSP study of molecule (XXVI) from the sixth blind test [Reilly et al. (2016). Acta Cryst. B 72 , 439–459], which is challenging due to its size and flexibility. Its known experimental form is successfully predicted as the global minimum. The computational cost of the study is tractable without the need to make unphysical simplifying assumptions.",

The structures of the iQCs were found to be isostructural to the parent i-YbCd 5.7 , which consists of a so-called Tsai-type rhombic triacontahedron (RTH) cluster and double Friauf polyhedron, and that of the 1/1 AP was found to be isostructural to YbCd 6 , which is described by a body-centred packing of the same type of RTH cluster. In the iQCs, it was found that there are three types of Cd/Mg occupation, namely, Cd preferential site, Mg preferential site and Cd/Mg mixed site, and the occupation probabilities of Mg atoms at the Mg preferential site show a saturation behaviour around the Mg content of 20 at.%. This selective Mg occupation is identified as a cause of the non-linear increase in the icosahedral lattice constant with increasing Mg content. The 1/1 AP has a similar selective Mg occupation to that of the iQCs in terms of the shell structures of the Tsai-type RTH cluster. In both iQCs and the 1/1 AP, the Mg preferential sites have a smaller number of Yb atoms among their coordination numbers. Moreover, short-range order (s.r.o.) diffuse scattering was observed on the diffraction patterns of the iQCs at the positions corresponding to a face-centred-type ( F -type) icosahedral superlattice. The F -type s.r.o. was found to result from the Mg substitution.",

    "abstract": "The quality of various approximation methods for modelling anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) for hydrogen atoms was investigated in a comparative study. A multipole refinement was performed against high-resolution single crystal X-ray data of 9-diphenylthiophosphoranylanthracene (SPAnH) and 9,10-bis-diphenylthiophosphoranylanthracene·toluene (SPAnPS). Hydrogen-atom parameters and structural properties derived from our collected neutron data sets were compared with those obtained from the SHADE -server, the software APD-Toolkit based on the invariom database, the results from Hirshfeld atom refinement conducted in the OLEX2 GUI ( HARt ), and the results of anisotropic hydrogen refinement within XD2016 . Additionally, a free refinement of H-atom positions against X-ray data was performed with fixed ADPs from various methods. The resulting C—H bond distances were compared with distances from neutron diffraction experiments and the HARt results. Surprisingly, the refinement of anisotropic hydrogen displacement parameters against the X-ray data yielded the smallest deviations from the neutron values. However, the refinement of bond-directed quadrupole parameters turned out to be vital for the quality of the resulting ADPs. In both model structures, SHADE and, to a lesser extent, APD-Toolkit showed problems in dealing with atoms bonded to carbon atoms with refined Gram-Charlier parameters for anharmonic motion. The HARt method yields the most accurate C—H bond distances compared to neutron data results. Unconstrained refinement of hydrogen atom positions using ADPs derived from all other used approximation methods showed that even with well approximated hydrogen ADPs, the resulting distances were still significantly underestimated.",

In this paper the reasons for this peculiar behavior are investigated, employing a joint experimental and theoretical approach. This includes the design of cocrystals with coformers having a high propensity towards the formation of both aromatic-aromatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, determination of their structure, using solid-state NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, as well as calculations of stabilization energies of formation of the obtained cocrystals, followed by crystal structure prediction calculations and solubility measurements. The findings indicate that the stabilization energies of cocrystal formation are positive in all cases, which results from strain in the APR conformation in these crystal forms. On the other hand, solubility measurements show that the Gibbs free energy of formation of the apremilast:picolinamide cocrystal is negative, suggesting that the formation of the studied cocrystals is entropy driven. This entropic stabilization is associated with the disorder observed in almost all known cocrystals and solvates of APR.",

The value of the Avrami exponent corresponds to the constant growth rate of the new L1 2 phase and decreasing nucleation rate in the Fe–27.2Ga alloy and indicates the presence of pre-existing nucleation centres of the L1 2 phase in the Fe–28.0Ga alloy.",

We find that a structure with Pna 2 1 symmetry and a bilayer packing motif exhibits intermolecular bonding patterns reminiscent of π–π stacking and has markedly different electronic and optical properties than the experimentally observed P 2 1 / n structure with a cyclic dimer motif, including a narrower band gap, enhanced band dispersion and broader optical absorption.

It is slightly conducting in its bulk due to the presence of defects and by controlling the defects different physical properties can be fine tuned. However, studies of the defects in this material are often contradicting or inconclusive. Here, the defect structure of Bi 2 Se 3 is studied with a combination of techniques: high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM), high-resolution energy-dispersive X-ray (HR-EDX) spectroscopy, precession electron diffraction tomography (PEDT), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and first-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT). Based on these results, not only the observed defects are discussed, but also the discrepancies in results or possibilities across the techniques. STEM and EDX revealed interstitial defects with mainly Bi character in an octahedral coordination in the van der Waals gap, independent of the applied sample preparation method (focused ion beam milling or cryo-crushing). The inherent character of these defects is supported by their observation in the structure refinement of the EDT data. Moreover, the occupancy probability of the defects determined by EDT is inversely proportional to their corresponding DFT calculated formation energies. STEM also showed the migration of some atoms across and along the van der Waals gap. The kinetic barriers calculated using DFT suggest that some paths are possible at room temperature, while others are most probably beam induced.",

Although polymorph (IV) exhibits the same main aggregation motif as in previously reported BZC polymorphs (I)–(III), i.e. a hydrogen-bonded ribbon, its molecular packing and hydrogen-bonding pattern differ considerably. The N—H...N hydrogen bonds joining parallel BZC ribbons in crystals at ambient pressure are eliminated in polymorph (IV), and BZC ribbons become positioned at an angle of about 80°. Unfortunately, crystals of polymorph (IV) were not preserved on pressure release, and depending on the decompression protocol they transformed into polymorph (II) or (I).",

    "abstract": "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of a deleterious phase in the photocatalyst based on Cd 1 − x Zn x S/Zn(OH) 2 contains two relatively intense asymmetric peaks with d -spacings of 2.72 and 1.56 Å. Very small diffraction peaks with interplanar distances of ( d ) ≃ 8.01, 5.40, 4.09, 3.15, 2.49 and 1.35 Å are characteristic of this phase but not always observed. To identify this phase, the XRD patterns for sheet-like hydroxide β-Zn(OH) 2 and sheet-like hydrozincite Zn 5 (CO 3 ) 2 (OH) 6 as well as for turbostratic hydrozincite were simulated. It is shown that the XRD pattern calculated on the basis of the last model gives the best correspondence with experimental data. Distances between layers in the turbostratically disordered hydrozincite fluctuate around d ≃ 8.01 Å. This average layer-to-layer distance is significantly higher than the interlayer distance 6.77 Å in the ordered Zn 5 (CO 3 ) 2 (OH) 6 probably due to a deficiency of CO 3 2− anions, excess OH − and the presence of water molecules in the interlayers. It is shown by variable-temperature XRD and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) that the nanocrystalline turbostratic nonstoichiometric hydrozincite-like phase is quite thermostable. It decomposes into ZnO in air above 473 K.",

    "abstract": "With the remarkable progress of accelerator-based X-ray sources in terms of intensity and brightness, the investigation of structural dynamics from time-resolved X-ray diffraction methods is becoming widespread in chemistry, biochemistry and materials science applications. Diffraction patterns can now be measured down to the femtosecond time-scale using X-ray free electron lasers or table-top laser plasma X-ray sources. On the other hand, the recent developments in photon counting X-ray area detectors offer new opportunities for time-resolved crystallography. Taking advantage of the fast read-out, the internal stacking of recorded images, and the gating possibilities (electronic shutter) of the XPAD hybrid pixel detector, we implemented a laboratory X-ray diffractometer for time-resolved single-crystal X-ray diffraction after pulsed laser excitation, combined with transient optical absorption measurement. The experimental method and instrumental setup are described in detail, and validated using the photoinduced nitrosyl linkage isomerism of sodium nitroprusside, Na 2 [Fe(CN) 5 NO]·2H 2 O, as proof of principle. Light-induced Bragg intensity relative variations Δ I ( hkl )/ I ( hkl ) of the order of 1%, due to the photoswitching of the NO ligand, could be detected with a 6 ms acquisition window. The capabilities of such a laboratory time-resolved experiment are critically evaluated.",

The disorder is characterized by a lateral translational shift between the layers with a component ty of either +0.421 or -0.421. Order-disorder (OD) theory is used to derive the possible stacking sequences. Extensive lattice-energy minimizations were carried out on a large set of structural models with different stacking sequences, containing up to 2688 atoms. These calculations were used to determine the actual local structures and to derive the stacking probabilities. It is shown that local structures and energies depend not only on the arrangement of neighbouring layers, but also next-neighbouring layers. Large models with 100 layers were constructed according to the derived stacking probabilities. The diffraction patterns simulated from those models are in good agreement with the experimental single-crystal and powder diffraction patterns. Electron diffraction investigation on a nanocrystalline industrial sample revealed the same disorder. Hence the lattice-energy minimizations are able to explain the disorder and the diffuse scattering.",

For polymorph (I) the space group Fdd2 is confirmed rather than the original choice of Cc. The molecular structures of both polymorphs are essentially identical, with exact crystallographic twofold symmetry, approximate C2v symmetry, and a trans orientation of the H—N—C=O moiety. In both polymorphs the molecules associate into chains of rings with graph set C(4)[R21(6)] via bifurcated hydrogen-bond systems C(N—H)2⋯O=C. In the polar structure (I) the chains are necessarily all parallel, whereas in (II) equal numbers of parallel and antiparallel chains are present. Further physical investigations [differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder investigations, solvent-induced phase conversions] were undertaken: these showed: (i) that the commercially available compound consists predominantly of polymorph (II), which on heating transforms into polymorph (I) by an endothermic reaction, so that both polymorphs are related by enantiotropism; (ii) that polymorph (I) represents the more stable modification at room temperature, where polymorph (II) is metastable, with the thermodynamic transition temperature lying somewhere between 253 K and room temperature. An apparent third polymorph, consisting of fibrous needles, was shown by powder diffraction to consist of a mixture of polymorphs (I) and (II).",

We find no evidence of a phase transition between 10 and 273 K; above 273 K, however, the title compound transforms first to ammonium sesquicarbonate monohydrate and subsequently to ammonium bicarbonate. The crystallographic and spectroscopic data and the calculations reveal a quite strongly hydrogen-bonded structure ( E HB ≃ 30–40 kJ mol −1 ), on the basis of H...O bond lengths and the topology of the electron density at the bond critical points, in which there is no free rotation of the ammonium cation at any temperature. The barrier to free rotation of the ammonium ions is estimated from the observed librational frequency to be ∼ 36 kJ mol −1 .

This report demonstrates the ability to use high-energy X-ray scattering and atomic pair distribution function analysis, PDF, to resolve structure in amorphous metal oxide catalyst films. The analysis is applied here to resolve domain structure differences induced by oxyanion substitution during the electrochemical assembly of amorphous cobalt oxide catalyst films, Co-OEC. PDF patterns for Co-OEC films formed using phosphate, Pi, methylphosphate, MPi, and borate, Bi, electrolyte buffers show that the resulting domains vary in size following the sequence Pi &lt; MPi &lt; Bi. The increases in domain size for CoMPi and CoBi were found to be correlated with increases in the contributions from bilayer and trilayer stacked domains having structures intermediate between those of the LiCoOO and CoO(OH) mineral forms. The lattice structures and offset stacking of adjacent layers in the partially stacked CoMPi and CoBi domains were best matched to those in the LiCoOO layered structure. The results demonstrate the ability of PDF analysis to elucidate features of domain size, structure, defect content and mesoscale organization for amorphous metal oxide catalysts that are not readily accessed by other X-ray techniques. PDF structure analysis is shown to provide a way to characterize domain structures in different forms of amorphous oxide catalysts, and hence provide an opportunity to investigate correlations between domain structure and catalytic activity.",

    "abstract": "The cobalt carbonate hydroxide Co 2 CO 3 (OH) 2 is a technologically important solid which is used as a precursor for the synthesis of cobalt oxides in a wide range of applications. It also has relevance as a potential immobilizer of the toxic element cobalt in the natural environment, but its detailed crystal structure is so far unknown. The structure of Co 2 CO 3 (OH) 2 has now been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) simulations and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements on samples synthesized via deposition from aqueous solution. Two possible monoclinic phases are considered, with closely related but symmetrically different crystal structures, based on those of the minerals malachite [Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2 ] and rosasite [Cu 1.5 Zn 0.5 CO 3 (OH) 2 ], as well as an orthorhombic phase that can be seen as a common parent structure for the two monoclinic phases, and a triclinic phase with the structure of the mineral kolwezite [Cu 1.34 Co 0.66 CO 3 (OH) 2 ]. The DFT simulations predict that the rosasite-like and malachite-like phases are two different local minima of the potential energy landscape for Co 2 CO 3 (OH) 2 and are practically degenerate in energy, while the orthorhombic and triclinic structures are unstable and experience barrierless transformations to the malachite phase upon relaxation. The best fit to the PXRD data is obtained using a rosasite model [monoclinic with space group P 112 1 / n and cell parameters a = 3.1408 (4) Å, b = 12.2914 (17) Å, c = 9.3311 (16) Å and γ = 82.299 (16)°]. However, some features of the PXRD pattern are still not well accounted for by this refinement and the residual parameters are relatively poor. The relationship between the rosasite and malachite phases of Co 2 CO 3 (OH) 2 is discussed and it is shown that they can be seen as polytypes. Based on the similar calculated stabilities of these two polytypes, it is speculated that some level of stacking disorder could account for the poor fit of the PXRD data. The possibility that Co 2 CO 3 (OH) 2 could crystallize, under different growth conditions, as either rosasite or malachite, or even as a stacking-disordered phase intermediate between the two, requires further investigation.",

Results for only the former structural arrangement are reported in the present paper. The SF highlights to which extent the magnetic centres contribute to determine the local spin delocalization and polarization at any point in the dimetallic complex and whether an atom or group of atoms of the ligands act in favour or against a given local spin delocalization/polarization. Ball-and-stick atomic SF percentage representations allow for a visualization of the magnetic pathways and of the specific role played by each atom along these paths, at given reference points. Decomposition of SF contributions in terms of a magnetic and of a relaxation component provides further insight. Reconstruction of partial spin densities by means of the Source Function has for the first time been introduced. At variance with the standard SF percentage representations, such reconstructions offer a simultaneous view of the sources originating from specific subsets of contributing atoms, in a selected molecular plane or in the whole space, and are therefore particularly informative. The SF tool is also used to evaluate the accuracy of the analysed spin densities. It is found that those obtained at the unrestricted B3LYP DFT level, relative to those computed at the CASSCF(6,6) level, greatly overestimate spin delocalization to the ligands, but comparatively underestimate magnetic connection ( spin transmission ) among atoms, along the magnetic pathways. As a consequence of its excessive spin delocalization, the UB3LYP method also overestimates spin polarization mechanisms between the paramagnetic centres and the ligands. Spin delocalization measures derived from the refinement of Polarized Neutron Diffraction data seem in general superior to those obtained through the DFT UB3LYP approach and closer to the far more accurate CASSCF results. It is also shown that a visual agreement on the spin-resolved electron densities ρ α and ρ β derived from different approaches does not warrant a corresponding agreement between their associated spin densities.",

The electron-density parameters of real and dummy atoms present in a similar chemical environment were averaged on all the molecules studied to build a database of transferable spherical atoms. Compared with the now-popular databases of transferable multipolar parameters, the spherical charge modelling needs fewer parameters to describe the molecular electron density and can be more easily incorporated in molecular modelling software for the computation of electrostatic properties. The construction method of the database is described.

It has been shown that from accurate X-ray data it is possible to discuss the bonding capability of the metal atom (Cu/Cr) and the ligands in these complexes. A comparison of results obtained from averaged and non-averaged X-ray data demonstrates that using the non-averaged data and introducing an anisotropic correction for secondary extinction errors provides a more detailed distribution of the electron density in the area of the metal atoms. In both complexes studied, the bonding of the acetate oxygen atom to the central metal atom is significantly affected by the formation of hydrogen bonds. The electron density and its Laplacian at the bond critical point of metal–oxygen coordination bonds for those oxygen atoms not involved in the intermolecular hydrogen bonds are approximately 10% larger compared with the case when oxygen atoms take part in hydrogen bonds with the neighboring water molecules. It is shown that metal–oxygen bonds in a quasi-equatorial plane are typical coordination bonds and differ significantly from the apical metal–oxygen bond. Metal–metal interaction with a small positive value of the electron density Laplacian at this bond critical point is mainly of electrostatic character. The metal–metal interaction is definitely not a bond according to the classical definition. Based on a search of the Cambridge Structural Database, it can be argued that there are four typical coordination bonds in the [CuO 6 ] chromophore, similar to the four Cu—O coordination bonds in the basal plane of the CuO 5 pyramid in one of the complexes under study.",

    "abstract": "Taxifolin, also known as dihydroquercetin, is the major flavonoid in larch wood. It is well known as an antioxidant and a bioactive substance. Taxifolin as an active pharmaceutical ingredient is produced industrially in crystalline form during the processing of larch wood. Some information is available on nano- and microstructured particles of taxifolin. This paper reports on the generation of a new form of taxifolin as microtubes. These self-assembled tubes were obtained from raw taxifolin by crystal engineering with urea at ambient temperature and pressure. The parameters of temperature, pH value, molar ratio of taxifolin and urea, and time duration were optimized for yield enhancement of the microtubes. The water solubility and melting point of the new form of taxifolin were established. The microtubes were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction, microscopy, mass spectrometry, 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the microtubes and raw taxifolin both exist in crystalline form with the same structure of the crystal unit. However, they are characterized by different morphological and physicochemical properties. Computer simulation was performed to explain the mechanism of the self-assembly process.",

    "abstract": "Geometrical restraints provide key structural information for the determination of biomolecular structures at lower resolution by experimental methods such as crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. In this work, restraint targets for nucleic acids bases are derived from three different sources and compared: small-molecule crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), ultrahigh-resolution structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations. The best parameters are those based on CSD structures. After over two decades, the standard library of Parkinson et al. [(1996), Acta Cryst . D 52 , 57–64] is still valid, but improvements are possible with the use of the current CSD database. The CSD-derived geometry is fully compatible with Watson–Crick base pairs, as comparisons with QM results for isolated and paired bases clearly show that the CSD targets closely correspond to proper base pairing. While the QM results are capable of distinguishing between single and paired bases, their level of accuracy is, on average, nearly two times lower than for the CSD-derived targets when gauged by root-mean-square deviations from ultrahigh-resolution structures in the PDB. Nevertheless, the accuracy of QM results appears sufficient to provide stereochemical targets for synthetic base pairs where no reliable experimental structural information is available. To enable future tests for this approach, QM calculations are provided for isocytosine, isoguanine and the iCiG base pair.",

For the first time, vibrational frequencies, phonon dispersion relations, elasto-piezo-dielectric tensor, thermodynamic and thermomechanical properties of rs-ZnS were calculated with a consistent approach that allows a direct comparison with the low-pressure polymorph. Special attention was paid to the evaluation of the thermodynamic pressure-temperature stability of the mineral phases between 0-25 GPa and 0-800 K. The static (T = 0 K) bulk moduli of sphalerite and rock-salt ZnS were 72.63 (3) GPa and 84.39 (5) GPa, respectively. The phase transition in static conditions calculated from the equation of state was about 15.5 GPa, whereas the elastic constants data resulted in Ptrans = 14.6 GPa. At room temperature (300 K), the zb-rs transition occurs at 14.70 GPa and a negative Clapeyron slope (dP)/(dT) = 0.0023 was observed up to 800 K. The electronic band structure showed a direct band gap for zb-ZnS (Eg = 4.830 eV at equilibrium geometry), which became an indirect one by increasing pressure above 11 GPa. The results were found to be in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical data, further extending the knowledge of important properties of zinc sulfide, in particular the thermomechanical ones of the rock-salt polymorph here extensively explored for the first time.",

Mechanisms are proposed for the formation of the sessile dislocations in the main slip systems at the room temperature and the glissile dislocations in the new slip systems activated at high temperatures. Furthermore, the correlation of the plastic strain and fracture toughness with the temperature-dependent slip activation, dislocation reaction and transformation is explained quantitatively.

    "abstract": "A part of the system CaO-SiO2-Al2O3-Fe2O3-MgO which is of relevance to iron-ore sintering has been studied in detail. For a bulk composition corresponding to 10.45 wt% CaO, 5.49 wt% MgO, 69.15 wt% Fe2O3, 13.37 wt% Al2O3 and 1.55 wt% SiO2 synthesis runs have been performed in air in the range between 1100 and 1300°C. Products have been characterized using reflected-light microscopy, electron microprobe analysis and diffraction techniques. At 1250°C, an almost phase-pure material with composition Ca2.99Mg2.67Fe3+14.58Fe2+0.77Al4.56Si0.43O36 has been obtained. The compound corresponds to the first Si-containing representative of the M14+6nO20+8n polysomatic series of so-called SFCA phases (Silico-Ferrites of Calcium and Aluminum) with n = 2 and is denoted as SFCA-III. Single-crystal diffraction investigations using synchrotron radiation at the X06DA beamline of the Swiss Light Source revealed that the chemically homogenous sample contained both a triclinic and monoclinic polytype. Basic crystallographic data are as follows: triclinic form: a = 10.3279 (2) Å, b = 10.4340 (2) Å, c = 14.3794 (2) Å, α = 93.4888 (12)°, β = 107.3209 (14)° and γ = 109.6626 (14)°, V = 1370.49 (5) Å3, Z = 2, space group P{\\overline 1}; monoclinic form: a = 10.3277 (2) Å, b = 27.0134 (4) Å, c = 10.4344 (2) Å, β = 109.668 (2)°, V = 2741.22 (9) Å3, Z = 4, space group P21/n. Structure determination of both modifications was successful using diffraction data from the same allotwinned crystal. A description of the observed polytypism within the framework of OD-theory is presented. Triclinic and monoclinic SFCA-III actually correspond to the two possible maximum degree of order structures based on OD-layers containing three spinel (S) and one pyroxene (P) modules (〈S3P〉). The existence of SFCA-III in industrial iron-ore sinters has yet to be confirmed. Polytypism is likely to occur in other SFCA-members (SFCA, SFCA-I) relevant to sintering as well, but has so far been neglected in the characterization of industrial samples. Our results shed light on this phenomenon and may therefore be also helpful for better interpretation of the powder diffraction patterns that are used for phase analysis of iron-ore sinters.",

Methylation has not only excluded the formation of selected hydrogen bonds, but also introduced bulky mobile fragments into the structure. The effects of pressure on the systems of the series were compared with respect to distorting and switching over hydrogen bonds and inducing reorientation of the methylated fragments. Phase transitions with fragmentation of the single crystals into fine powder were observed for partially methylated N -methyl- and N , N -dimethylglycine, whereas the structural changes in betaine were continuous with some peculiar features in the 1.4–2.9 GPa pressure range and accompanied by splitting of the crystals into several large fragments. Structural rearrangements in sarcosine and betaine were strongly dependent on the rate of pressure variation: the higher the rate of increasing pressure, the lower the pressure at which the phase transition occurred.",

Chain polymers with six-coordinated metal cations are obtained from CdCl2 and with alternating five- and six-coordinated Cd centers from CdBr2. In either case, the formation of these compounds does not depend on the precise stoichiometry. In contrast, two different reaction products form with the heavier congener CdI2, namely a ligand-rich molecular complex CdI2(HacacPy)2 and a ligand-deficient one-dimensional polymer [CdI2(HacacPy)](1)(∞). Interconversion between these two iodo derivatives is possible via thermal degradation and mechanochemical synthesis. The acetylacetone moiety in HacacPy may be deprotonated and chelated to Fe(III), and the resulting complex Fe(acacPy)3 reacts analogously to a bridging polypyridine ligand towards the same Cd halides as the molecule HacacPy itself. With CdCl2 and CdBr2, isomorphous chain polymers are obtained in which the Cd cations adopt distorted octahedral coordination and one of the peripheric pyridyl groups remains uncoordinated. With CdI2, the iron complex acts as a mu3Fe(acacPy)3 bridge between tetrahedral Cd centers and gives rise to a ladder structure.",

In addition, the non-planarity of the PHT molecule in the cocrystal results in PHT emitting weak phosphorescence and relatively strong delayed fluorescence. Thus, a wide range of delayed fluorescence and weak phosphorescence could play a significant role in selecting a proper π-conjugated system to engineer functional cocrystal and luminescent materials by halogen bonds.",

    "abstract": "In this review, recent developments concerning data and model quality in experimental charge-density investigations from a personal view-point are described. Data quality is not only achieved by the high resolution, high I /σ( I ) values, low merging R values and high multiplicity. The quality of the innermost reflections especially is crucial for mapping the density distribution of the outermost valence electrons and can be monitored by ( I /σ) asymptotic . New detector technologies seem to be promising improvements. Empirical corrections to correct for low-energy contamination of mirror-focused X-ray data and for resolution- and temperature-dependent errors caused by factors such as thermal diffuse scattering are described. Shashlik-like residual density patterns can indicate the need for an anharmonic description of the thermal motion of individual atoms. The physical reliability of the derived model must be thoroughly analysed. The derived probability density functions for the mean-squared atomic vibrational displacements especially should have only small negative values. The treatment of H atoms has been improved by methods to estimate anisotropic thermal motion. For very high resolution data, the polarization of the core density cannot be neglected. Several tools to detect systematic errors are described. A validation tool is presented that easily detects when the refinement of additional parameters yields a real improvement in the model or simply overfits the given data. In all investigated structures, it is proved that the multipole parameters of atoms with a comparable chemical environment should be constrained to be identical. The use of restraints could be a promising alternative.",

PMN samples were synthesized under different sample processing conditions. The line profile broadening analysis of room-temperature synchrotron powder XRD patterns was performed using the multi-phase Rietveld refinement method for isotropic microstructural evaluation of different PMN samples. The two phases of perovskite PMN considered in the Rietveld refinement approach for satisfactorily fitting the XRD patterns are the paraelectric cubic phase ( Pm \\overline 3 m ) and the local rhombohedral phase ( R 3 m ) which corresponds to the PNRs. It is observed that the contributions of the Gaussian component of size broadening of the polar rhombohedral phase ( R 3 m ) and the Lorentzian component of strain broadening of the paraelectric cubic phase ( Pm \\overline 3 m ) are apposite for satisfactory Rietveld refinement of the synchrotron XRD data for all PMN samples. The volume-average crystallite size of PNRs ( R 3 m phase) is almost invariant (approximately 12 nm) with increasing processing temperature while their weight percentage increases. The values of the apparent microstrain in the paraelectric cubic phase ( Pm \\overline 3 m ) are larger for hot-pressed samples.",

    "abstract": "The empirical relations between cubic spinel oxides of different compositions were investigated using data from 349 refined crystal structures. The results show that the spinel structure is able to tolerate many constituents (at least 36) by enlarging and decreasing the tetrahedra and octahedra. This is reflected in a large variation in tetrahedral and octahedral bond distances. The oxygen positional parameter (u) may be regarded as a measure of the distortion of the spinel structure from cubic close packing or of the angular distortion of the octahedron. The distortion can best be explained in terms of ionic potential (IP), which merges the size and charge properties of an ion. Sterically induced distortion depends on ion size, whereas electrostatically induced distortion is caused by cation-cation repulsion across faces of tetrahedra and shared edges of octahedra. The strong correlations between the u parameter and the IP at the T and M sites are consistent with the main role played by the both charge and size. Large distortions (u ≫ 0.27) result in oxygen-oxygen distances of the octahedron shorter than 2.50 Å, which would lead to structural instability because of increased non-bonded repulsion forces between the oxygen atoms.",

Here, a highly reliable automated workflow for oxidation-state assignment in transition-metal coordination complexes via CSD Python API (application programming interface) scripts is presented. The strengths and limitations of the bond-valence sum (BVS) method are discussed and the use of complementary methods for improved assignment confidence is explored. In total, four complementary techniques have been implemented in this study. The resulting workflow overcomes the limitations of the BVS approach, widening the applicability of an automated procedure to more CSD entries. Assignments are successful for 99% of the cases where a high consensus between different methodologies is observed.

Several model nickel(II), palladium(II), platinum(II) and gold(I) complexes were chosen for a theoretical analysis of R-S...M interactions using the DFT method applied to (equilibrium) isolated systems. A combination of the real-space approaches, such as Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), noncovalent interaction index (NCI), electron localization function (ELF) and Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA), and orbital (Natural Bond Orbitals, NBO) methods was used to provide insights into the nature and energetics of R-S...M interactions with respect to the metal atom identity and its coordination environment. The explored features of the R-S...M interactions support the trends observed by inspecting the CSD statistics, and indicate a predominant contribution of semicoordination bonds between nucleophilic sites of the sulfur atom and electrophilic sites of the metal. A contribution of chalcogen bonding (that is formally opposite to semicoordination) was also recognized, although it was significantly smaller in magnitude. The analysis of R-S...M interaction strengths was performed and the structure-directing role of the intramolecular R-S...M interactions in stabilizing certain conformations of metal complexes was revealed.",

Re-ranking with dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) methods further improves the scoring. After DFT-D geometry optimization the observed crystal structure is found at the leading top of the ranking list.

In contrast, the conformational energies of molecule XXXII prove difficult to determine reliably, and variations in the computed conformational energies appreciably impact the crystal energy landscape. Even high-level methods such as revDSD-PBEP86-D4 and SCS-MP2D exhibit significant disagreements with the DLPNO-CCSD(T1) benchmarks for molecule XXXII, highlighting the difficulty of predicting conformational energies for complex, drug-like molecules. The best-converged predicted crystal energy landscape obtained here for molecule XXXII disagrees significantly with what has been inferred about the solid-form landscape experimentally. The identified limitations of the calculations are probably insufficient to account for the discrepancies between theory and experiment on molecule XXXII, and further investigation of the experimental solid-form landscape would be valuable. Finally, assessment of several semi-empirical methods finds r 2 SCAN-3c to be the most promising, with conformational energy accuracy intermediate between the GGA and hybrid functionals and a low computational cost.",

    "abstract": "The seventh blind test of crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods substantially increased the level of complexity of the target compounds relative to the previous tests organized by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. In this work, the performance of density-functional methods is assessed using numerical atomic orbitals and the exchange-hole dipole moment dispersion correction (XDM) for the energy-ranking phase of the seventh blind test. Overall, excellent performance was seen for the two rigid molecules (XXVII, XXVIII) and for the organic salt (XXXIII). However, for the agrochemical (XXXI) and pharmaceutical (XXXII) targets, the experimental polymorphs were ranked fairly high in energy amongst the provided candidate structures and inclusion of thermal free-energy corrections from the lattice vibrations was found to be essential for compound XXXI. Based on these results, it is proposed that the importance of vibrational free-energy corrections increases with the number of rotatable bonds.",

    "abstract": "The bond-valence model was commonly considered as inappropriate to metal cluster compounds, but recently it was shown that the model provides unique information on the lattice strains and stabilization mechanisms in (TM)6-chalcohalides, Mx(TM)6Ly (TM = transition metal, L = the chalcogen and/or halogen ligands; M = counter-cation). The previous study was mainly devoted to the non-uniform distribution of the anion valences (bond-valence sums) around clusters. This and the previous paper are focused on two additional phenomena: (i) a steric conflict between counter-cations and the cluster-ligand framework resulting in `common' lattice strains [previous paper: Levi et al. (2013). Acta Cryst. B69, 419-425], and (ii) steric conflict between the small (TM)6-cluster and the large coordination polyhedron around the cluster or so-called matrix effect (this paper). It was shown that both phenomena can be well described by changes in the bond-valence parameters. This paper demonstrates that the matrix effect results in high strains in the TM-L bonds in most of the (TM)6-chalcohalides (TM = Nb, Mo, W and Re). In spite of this, the violations for the total TM valence are minimal, because the cluster stretching is fully or partially compensated by compression of the TM-L bonds. As a result, the influence of the matrix effect on the material stability is rather positive: it decreases the volume of the structural units and in many cases ensures a more favorable distribution of the bond valences around TM atoms, stabilizing the cluster compound.",

It crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) (No. 19), with a = 5.9470 (4), b = 10.402(1) (5), c = 13.5773 (7) Å, V = 839.91 (8) Å(3), Z = 4. Its structure consists of one-dimensional chains of corner-sharing Fe(II)O6 octahedra that are additionally cross-linked with citrate ligands. Chains are additionally stabilized into a pseudo-three-dimensional structure by hydrogen bonds. The measurement of magnetic properties revealed that the magnetic moment is almost constant above 100 K (μeff = 5.1 µB), but decreases rapidly below this temperature most probably due to the appearance of weak antiferromagnetic interactions between Fe atoms. Additionally, analysis of Mossbauer spectra confirmed the presence of divalent Fe atoms in the structure. Thermogravimetrical and X-ray high-temperature diffraction analyses showed the thermal stability of the material up to 548 K.",

Fourier transform-IR experiments involving solutions of mixtures of difluoroiodomethane with trimethylphosphine(-d9) or dimethyl sulfide(-d6) in liquid krypton confirm the coexistence of a halogen-bonded and hydrogen-bonded complex. Also for solutions containing chloromethane, evidence of the formation of binary associations is found, but no definitive assignment of the multiple complex bands could be made. Using van't Hoff plots, the experimental complexation enthalpies for the halogen- and hydrogen-bonded complex of difluoroiodomethane with trimethylphosphine are determined to be -15.4 (4) and -10.5 (3) kJ mol-1, respectively, while for the halogen- and hydrogen-bonded complexes with dimethyl sulfide, the values are -11.3 (5) and -7.7 (6) kJ mol-1, respectively.

PQQ and PQQH 2 molecules play an important role as a cofactor in ADH and GDH reactions. However, crystal structure analysis has not been performed for PQQ and PQQH 2 . In the present study, the synthesis of PQQH 2 powder crystals was performed under air, by utilizing vitamin C as a reducing agent. By reacting a trihydrate of disodium salt of PQQ (PQQNa 2 ·3H 2 O) with excess vitamin C in H 2 O at 293 and 343 K, yellowish brown and black powder crystals of PQQH 2 having different properties were obtained in high yield, respectively. The former was PQQH 2 trihydrate (PQQH 2 ·3H 2 O) and the latter was PQQH 2 anhydrate (PQQH 2 ). Furthermore, sodium-free red PQQ powder crystal (a monohydrate of PQQ, PQQ·H 2 O) was prepared by the reaction of PQQNa 2 ·3H 2 O with HCl in H 2 O.

However, only one metal atom can be plausibly correct in these structures, and other spectroscopic data are unavailable. Using aspherical scattering factors, a structure can be identified as correct from the deposited Bragg intensities alone and modelling only the ligand environment often suffices to make this distinction.

The first stage of the method establishes the characteristics of all, without exception, noncovalent interactions in all crystal structures under discussion. This is possible using a strict and objective method of construction of Voronoi-Dirichlet polyhedra within the framework of the stereoatomic model of crystal structures. The second stage of the method then involves plotting of diagrams, showing the relation between parameters characterizing interatomic interactions and chosen geometric parameters of molecules. Application of the title method to highly polymorphic systems of ROY and flufenamic acid allows several imperceptible features of real crystal structures to be revealed and determines the value of different types of interactions in their conformational polymorphs. The method is universal as it can be readily adapted to any system of crystal structures in which noncovalent interactions change as a function of any parameters. Employment of the title method along with quantum chemical calculations offers opportunities for the correlation of potential energy of crystalline materials with noncovalent interactions in their structures, which is a giant step forward towards a more complete understanding of the relationship between the structure and properties of compounds.",

These have been analysed from the perspective of symmetry, by considering possible order parameters operating with respect to a parent structure which has space group Im{\\bar 3} m. Heusler structures with different stoichiometries are derived by operation of order parameters belonging to irreducible representations {\\rm H}^{+}_{1}and P1 to describe the atomic ordering configurations. Electronic instabilities are ascribed to an order parameter belonging to the Brillouin zone centre, \\Gamma^{+}_{3}, which couples with shear strains to give tetragonal and orthorhombic distortions. An additional zone centre order parameter, with \\Gamma^{+}_{5} symmetry, is typically a secondary order parameter but in some cases may drive a transition. Soft-mode instabilities produce commensurate and incommensurate structures for which the order parameters have symmetry properties relating to points along the Σ line of the Brillouin zone for the cubic I lattice. The electronic and soft-mode order parameters have multiple components and are coupled in a linear–quadratic manner as \\lambda q_{\\Gamma}q_{\\Sigma}^{2}.

    "abstract": "Copper and silver are common constituents in natural sulfosalts and can be present as minor or major components. Owing to the different kinds of coordination they can assume, these elements give rise to a number of sulfosalts that are usually quite complex to describe from a structural point of view because of the presence of twinning, disorder, polytypism and sometimes incommensurate modulation. Moreover, it is common to find them in different, partially occupied split sites, favoring the presence of strong ionic conductivity that can be related to a number of interesting technological properties. In this regard, a series of Cu- and Ag-rich sulfosalts showing an excess of these cations with respect to As, Sb and Bi is particularly interesting. Their crystal structures as well as their potential interest for materials science and solid-state physics are outlined. Copper- and mixed (Cu, Ag)-sulfosalts belonging to the wittichenite, tetrahedrite, galkhaite, routhierite and nowackiite series are discussed, together with some related compounds. Whereas in the wittichenite series Cu has either a trigonal planar or tetrahedral coordination, in members of the other series this element forms three-dimensional tetrahedral frameworks giving rise to cavities hosting other cations and anions. More difficult is the description of Ag-rich sulfosalts owing to the highly variable coordination environments shown by this element.

    "abstract": "X-ray crystallographic and computational studies are reported for a series of boranthrenes, substituted with halogen atoms. The role of competitive hydrogen (O-H...O, O-H...F, C-H...O) and halogen (Cl...Cl, O...Br, F...F) bonding interactions on the molecular arrangement in the crystal structures is discussed. The structural analysis and calculations reveal that the O-H...O hydrogen bond in the unsubstituted derivative 5,10-dihydroxy-5,10-dihydroboranthrene, C12H10B2O2, is of moderate strength (ca -20 kJ mol(-1)), but weaker than that in the related thiophene derivative 4,8-dihydro-4,8-dihydroxy-p-diborino[2,3-b:5,6-b]dithiophene, C8H6B2O2S2 (ca -40 kJ mol(-1)). This is due to shielding of the OH group by the H atoms in the β-position of the boranthrene unit. Structural diversity derived from the flexibility of the O-H...O hydrogen bond facilitates the occurrence of other competitive interactions. For instance, in the 1,6-difluoro derivative, C12H8B2F2O2, the crystal packing results from O-H...F and F...F interactions. In turn, the 1,6-dibromo derivative, C12H8B2Br2O2, is dominated by Br...O halogen-bond interactions. In the most interesting case, the 1,6-dichloro derivative, C12H8B2Cl2O2, molecular disorder leads to the formation of two different supramolecular arrangements co-existing in the crystal lattice, one based on the Cl...Cl and C-H...O bonds, and the other stabilized by O-H...O hydrogen bonds. Calculations performed with density-functional theory (DFT; CRYSTAL09) and PIXEL methodologies show that both lattices are characterized by similar energy values (ca -100 kJ mol(-1)). A mixed arrangement with random or short-range-ordered molecular orientations can also be expected.",

A comparison of the high-temperature datasets suggests that the best quasiperiodic ordering should exist between 1083 and 1153 K. However, neither the refined structures nor the phasonic displacement parameter vary significantly with temperature. This indicates that the phasonic contribution to entropy does not seem to play a major role in the stability of this decagonal phase in contrast to other kinds of structural disorder, which suggests that, in this respect, this decagonal phase would be similar to other complex intermetallic high-temperature phases.",

    "abstract": "Framework materials have structures containing strongly bonded polyhedral groups of atoms connected through their vertices. Typically the energy cost for variations of the inter-polyhedral geometry is much less than the cost of distortions of the polyhedra themselves – as in the case of silicates, where the geometry of the SiO 4 tetrahedral group is much more strongly constrained than the Si—O—Si bridging angle. As a result, framework materials frequently display intrinsic flexibility, and their dynamic and static properties are strongly influenced by low-energy collective motions of the polyhedra. Insight into these motions can be obtained in reciprocal space through the `rigid unit mode' (RUM) model, and in real-space through template-based geometric simulations. We briefly review the framework flexibility phenomena in energy-relevant materials, including ionic conductors, perovskites and zeolites. In particular we examine the `flexibility window' phenomenon in zeolites and present novel results on the flexibility window of the EMT framework, which shed light on the role of structure-directing agents. Our key finding is that the crown ether, despite its steric bulk, does not limit the geometric flexibility of the framework.",

In the UBDB model, these effects begin to play an important role at distances below twice the equilibrium distance and significantly increase as distances decrease. At equilibrium distances they are responsible for 30-50% of Ees for polar molecules and around 90% of Ees for nonpolar molecules. When the energy estimation from the UBDB is reduced to point multipoles, the results are comparable to point charges fitted to electrostatic potentials. On the other hand, particular components of energy from point multipole moments from the UBDB model are sensitive to the type of interaction and might be helpful in the characterization of interactions.",

    "abstract": "We present Synchrotron XRD measurements on powdered single crystal samples of BaFe2-xRuxAs2 samples, as a function of Ru content at room temperature. The Rietveld refinements reveal that the a-axis increases with Ru substitution, while the c-axis decreases. The variation of positional co-ordinates of As (zAs), the Fe-As bond length and the As-Fe-As bond angles have been determined from the Rietveld refinements. In the sample with x=0.1, temperature dependent XRD measurements were carried out. The results indicate that while the orthorhombicity shows the characteristic increase with decrease in temperature, the As-Fe-As bond angles, Fe-As bond length and positional co-ordinate of the As show definite anomalies close to the structural transition. First principle ab-initio simulations are performed in order to understand the experimentally observed anomalies in structural parameters. The experimental observations are discussed in the context of the simulation results.",

    "abstract": "The abrupt green-to-yellow thermochromism observed for certain A2CuCl4 compounds has long been attributed to the presence of strong N-H hydrogen bonding in the low-temperature phase that favors square-planar CuCl4(2-) (green in color) through reduction of ligand-ligand repulsion. Weakening of the hydrogen bonding at higher temperature results in the transformation to (far more common) flattened-tetrahedral geometry - the expected geometry for CuBr4(2-) complexes due to their greater ligand-ligand repulsion. The square-planar to flattened-tetrahedral transitions in (1,2,6-trimethylpyridinium)2CuX4 provide the first examples of this phase transformation in the absence of N-H hydrogen bonding and for a CuBr4(2-) complex. These results suggest that the square-planar to flattened-tetrahedral transformation in CuX4(2-) systems may be more common than previously thought.",

The acids for VT were selected based on ΔpKa being greater than 2 or 3. Salts of hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydrochloric acid (HCl), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), saccharin (SAC) and L-aspartic acid (ASP) were reported. All salts were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The acidic proton is transferred to the secondary N atom on the piperazine ring of VT, forming the charge-assisted hydrogen bond N+-H...X- (X = Cl, Br, O). Solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) experiments were carried out in distilled water (pH = 7.0) to compare the solubilities of the salts with that of VT. The VT-ASP-H2O (1:1:2) salt showed 414 times higher solubility and 1722 times faster IDR compared with VT. VT-ASP-H2O (1:1:2) is a high solubility salt that is stable in a slurry experiment at 298 K in 95% ethanol. The experimental data for the VT-ASP-H2O (1:1:2) salt identify it as a promising drug candidate.",

Two new solid forms of LM, a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvate and an unsolvated form defined as form D, were discovered and characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, polarized light microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. To investigate the thermodynamic mechanism of solvent-mediated desolvation transformation (SMDT) from LM DMSO solvate to form D, solubilities of LM DMSO solvate and form D in binary solvent mixtures of DMSO and water at different water volume fractions and temperatures (293.15–323.15 K) were measured and correlated by non-random two liquids model. The solubility data were used to evaluate the thermodynamic driving force of the SMDT process from DMSO solvate to form D and the effect of the activities of water and DMSO on the transformation process. Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor in situ the solid phase compositions during the SMDT process from LM DMSO solvate to form D while the solution concentration was measured by the gravimetric method. The overall desolvation transformation experiments demonstrated that the SMDT process was controlled by the nucleation and growth of form D. Moreover, effects of operating factors on the SMDT process were studied and the results illustrated that water activity in solution was the paramount parameter in the SMDT process. Finally, a new SMDT mechanism was suggested and discussed.",

The chemical bond and interatomic interactions inside and between crystal substructures at the balance of intracrystalline forces are characterized in detail. The role of each of the ions in the formation of the ferroelectric phase was studied and the features of the electron-density deformation in the niobium and oxygen substructures, and the role of each of them in the occurrence of spontaneous polarization are established. The position-space distribution of electrostatic and quantum forces in KNbO 3 is restored. It is emphasized that for the completeness of the analysis of the nature of the ferroelectric properties it is necessary to consider both static and kinetic electronic factors, which are of a quantum origin. The experimental results and theoretical estimations by the Kohn–Sham calculation with periodic boundary conditions are in reasonable agreement, thus indicating the physical significance of the findings of this study.",

    "abstract": "The crystal and electronic structure of an isocyanuric acid derivative was studied by high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction within the Hansen–Coppens multipole formalism. The observed deformation electron density shows signs of thermal smearing. The experimental picture meaningfully assigned to the consequences of unmodelled anharmonic atomic motion. Straightforward simultaneous refinement of all parameters, including Gram–Charlier coefficients, resulted in more significant distortion of apparent static electron density, even though the residual density became significantly flatter and more featureless. Further, the method of transferring multipole parameters from the model refined against theoretical structure factors as an initial guess was employed, followed by the subsequent block refinement of Gram–Charlier coefficients and the other parameters. This procedure allowed us to appropriately distinguish static electron density from the contaminant smearing effects of insufficiently accounted atomic motion. In particular, some covalent bonds and the weak π...π interaction between isocyanurate moieties were studied via the mutual penetration of atomic-like kinetic and electrostatic potential φ-basins with complementary atomic ρ-basins. Further, local electronic temperature was applied as an advanced descriptor for both covalent bonds and noncovalent interactions. Total probability density function (PDF) of nuclear displacement showed virtually no negative regions close to and around the atomic nuclei. The distribution of anharmonic PDF to a certain extent matched the residual electron density from the multipole model before anharmonic refinement. No signs of disordering of the sulfonyl group hidden in the modelled anharmonic motion were found in the PDF.",

    "abstract": "Stress-induced transformations of labile multicomponent organic solids may have a significant impact on industrial manufacturing processes, for example, in the pharmaceutical field. This study considers 15 carbamazepine (CBZ) multicomponent crystal forms, with the aim of identifying the structural and surface features that drive the outcome of thermal stress-induced transformations. Analysis of the crystal structures, and specifically the degree of similarity with the CBZ polymorphs produced by desolvation-like processes, identifies some degree of correlation between structural features. In particular, mutually exclusive supramolecular motifs identified previously within CBZ crystal structures are frequently (but not invariably) preserved, and thereby provide some indication of the anticipated polymorphic outcome. This is broadly consistent with established models relating reactant and product crystal phases. Some of the CBZ multicomponent materials show surface modifications indicative of the formation of a liquid intermediate phase, which provides an alternative dissolution/recrystallization mechanism and different polymorphic outcomes compared to the direct solid–solid transformation pathway. Other cases show intermediates of varying stoichiometry and instances of chemical decomposition. Hence, the product of thermal decomposition is frequently affected by the physical properties of the coformer, such as boiling point and reactivity. This can lead to a dependence on experimental conditions, especially when events such as recrystallization, chemical decomposition of the coformer, solubilization and peritectic melting occur concomitantly. This study highlights that the overall picture is complex, even within this series of closely related materials.",

Despite the commercial importance of the compound, the crystal structure remained undetermined until now. Using a special vacuum sublimation technique, micron-sized crystals could be obtained. Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) data were collected in two ways: (i) in static geometry using a combined stage-tilt/beam-tilt collection scheme and (ii) in continuous rotation mode. Both types of data allowed the crystal structure to be solved by direct methods. The structure was refined kinematically with anisotropic displacement parameters for all atoms. Due to the pronounced crystal mosaicity, a dynamic refinement was not feasible. The unit-cell parameters were verified by Rietveld refinement from powder X-ray diffraction data. The crystal structure was validated by many-body dispersion density functional theory (DFT) calculations. CuPcCl 16 crystallizes in the space group C 2/ m ( Z = 2), with the molecules arranged in layers. The structure agrees with that proposed in 1972.",

New single crystal X-ray diffraction data collected for all forms at 10 K and 122 K are presented. By combining periodic ab initio DFT calculations with normal-mode refinement against X-ray diffraction data, both enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy of all polymorphs are calculated. On the basis of the estimated free energies, the stability order of the polymorphs as a function of temperature and the corresponding solid state phase transition temperatures are anticipated. It can be concluded that the α and γ forms have higher vibrational entropy than that of the β and δ forms and therefore they are significantly more stabilized at higher temperatures. Due to the entropy which arises from the disorder in γ form, it overcomes form α and is the most stable form at temperatures above ∼500 K. Our findings are in qualitative agreement with the experimental calorimetry results.",

The general aim of the study is to investigate the quality of data for electron density analysis from current state-of-the-art conventional sources, and to see how the data perform in comparison with high-quality synchrotron data. A molecular crystal of melamine was selected as the test compound due to its ability to form excellent single crystals, the light atom content, and an advantageous suitability factor of 3.6 for electron density modeling. These features make melamine an optimal system for conventional X-ray diffractometers since the inherent advantages of synchrotron sources such as short wavelength and high intensity are less critical in this case. Data were obtained at 100 K from new in-house diffractometers Rigaku Synergy-S (Mo and Ag source, HyPix100 detector) and Stoe Stadivari (Mo source, EIGER2 1M CdTe detector), and an older Oxford Diffraction Supernova (Mo source, Atlas CCD detector). The synchrotron data were obtained at 25 K from BL02B1 beamline at SPring-8 in Japan (λ = 0.2480 Å, Pilatus3 X 1M CdTe detector). The five datasets were compared on general quality parameters such as resolution, 〈 I /σ〉, redundancy and R factors, as well as the more model specific fractal dimension plot and residual density maps. Comparison of the extracted electron densities reveals that all datasets can provide reliable multipole models, which overall convey similar chemical information. However, the new laboratory X-ray diffractometers with advanced pixel detector technology clearly measure data with significantly less noise and much higher reliability giving densities of higher quality, compared to the older instrument. The synchrotron data have higher resolution and lower measurement temperature, and they allow for finer details to be modeled ( e.g. hydrogen κ parameters).",

The structural refinement was carried out for two underlying tilings generated by the projection method for 6D space. The difference lies in the location of the origin point which for one tiling is in the vertex and for the second one in the center of the 6D unit cell. The two tilings exhibit mutual duality. The choice of the tiling has a minor effect on the final structural model as both converge to an R factor of ∼11.5%. The main difference is related to the treatment of the Cd4 tetrahedral motif which is either orientationally ordered and aligned with the threefold axis or disordered and modeled as a partially occupied icosahedron. Both models can be presented as a covering by rhombic triacontahedral clusters with identical positions of clusters within rhombohedral units. The shell structure is Tsai-type in the case of the first tiling and Bergman-type for the other.",

    "abstract": "A molecular crystal structure prediction (CSP) protocol used in the seventh blind test is presented. The seventh blind test was divided into two stages and included seven targets, with crystals containing from one to three molecules in asymmetric units, monomers built of up to 100 atoms, and all targets containing monomers with flexible degrees of freedom. Some targets were cocrystals and one target was a salt. These diverse targets were treated using a CSP protocol starting from finding the global and local minima conformations of the target molecule. Subsequently, an ab initio two-body rigid-monomer six-dimensional force field (aiFF) was developed for the global-minimum conformer. These aiFFs were then used in CSPs consisting of packing and lattice-energy minimization stages. Flexible-monomer CSPs were used for some targets. To describe the intramonomer FF, either generic empirical FFs or reparametrized FFs of this type were used, with some parameters fitted to ab initio energies of monomers in the latter case. A novel packing procedure was applied for two targets in stage 1. The success rate in the structure generation stage was 15% in submission phase and 54% in post-submission phase, while the corresponding values in the structure rating stage were 33% and 89%. We conclude that the inexpensive conformer-based approach with rigid-monomer CSPs can be recommended for investigations of crystals with flexible monomers. An advantage of this protocol is that it is fully based on first-principles quantum mechanics and generates tailor-made FFs suitable for use in subsequent molecular dynamics simulations investigating temperature-dependent effects. However, empirical intramonomer FFs reparametrized using ab initio data are not yet adequate for CSPs.",

Large high-quality crystals were specially produced by optimizing temperature-controlled growth conditions. The hydrate crystallizes in a channel-type structure formed by head-to-head dimer units of α-cyclodextrin molecules stacked like coins in a roll. The alkyl chain of the guest lipid is entirely embedded inside the tubular cavity delimited by the α-cyclodextrin dimer and adopts an all-trans planar zigzag conformation, while the alcohol polar head group is outside close to the α-cyclodextrin primary hydroxyl groups. The cyclodextrin dimer forms columns, which adopt a quasi-square arrangement much less compact than the quasi-hexagonal close packing already observed in the less hydrated α-cyclodextrin channel-type structures usually found with similar linear guests. The lack of compactness of this crystal form is related to the high number of interstitial water molecules. The replacement of 1-undecanol by 1-decanol does not modify the overall crystal structure of the hydrate as shown by additional X-ray diffraction investigations comparing the two host-guest assemblies. This is the first study that analyses the entire hydrogen-bonding network involved in the formation of a cyclodextrin dimer surrounded by its shell of water molecules.",

Out of these phases, the structure of γ-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 was already known whereas the structures of β- and α-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 were determined for the first time. The sequence of phase transitions is associated with an unusual change of symmetry, with triclinic intermediate β-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 phase and monoclinic low-temperature γ-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 as well as high-temperature α-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 phase. Taking the α-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 phase with space group P 2 1 / c as a parent structure, the γ-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 phase was refined as a twofold superstructure with symmetry P 2 1 / c , whereas the β-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 phase was a sixfold superstructure with symmetry P {\\overline 1}. To construct a unified structure model for all Sr 2 B 2 O 5 modifications, phases of γ- and β-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 were also refined as commensurately modulated structures using the basic unit cell of the parent α-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 . The phase transitions are related to the orientational order–disorder arrangement of B 2 O 5 pyroborate groups, where the degree of disorder grows towards the high-temperature phase. Thermal expansion is strongly anisotropic and dictated by preferable orientations of BO 3 triangles in the structure. The intermediate phase α′-Sr 2 B 2 O 5 , stable over a narrow temperature range (637–651 K), features the largest anisotropy of expansion for the known borates: α 11 = 205, α 22 = 57, α 33 = −81 × 10 −6 K −1 .",

Here it is shown that pyrite stoichiometry is relatively inflexible in both reductive conditions and in autogenous sulfur partial pressure, which produces samples with precise stoichiometry of FeS 2 even at different Fe/S ratios. By properly standardizing in situ gas-flow X-ray diffraction measurements, no significant changes in the lattice parameter of FeS 2 can be resolved, which portrays iron pyrite as prone to forming sulfur-deficient compounds, but not intrinsic defects in the manner of NiS 2−δ .",

The experimental electron density distribution study of AGH has been carried out from high-resolution X-ray diffraction data collected at 110.2 (3) K. The unit-cell packing of AGH was stabilized by strong O—H...O and weak C—H...O types of intermolecular interactions. The dissociation energy of the strong hydrogen bond O2—H22...O1 is very high, 32 kJ mol −1 . The percentage occupancy of H...H interactions is found to be maximum (68.5%) when it comparing with the other types of interactions occurring in the AGH crystalline phase. The atomic valance index ( V topo ) of the C16 atom is low compared with other carbon atoms; this shows that C16 could be the possible reactive location of the AGH molecule. All atoms in the OH groups have very low V topo values; this indicates their role in strong hydrogen bonding interactions. The electrostatic potential (ESP) surface of AGH shows the polarization of the C16=C17 bond and ESP contour map shows several maxima at the vicinity of the C16 atom; these results strongly demonstrate that the C16 atom is the reactive location of the AGH molecule. The molecular covalent docking analysis of AGH with the NF-κB receptor has been performed and confirmed this result. The highly electronegative region around γ-butyrolactone can be helpful for initial alignment of the AGH molecule in NF-κB receptor active site. The atomic volumes of the hydrogen atoms which participate in the H...H interaction are found to be low.",

    "abstract": "The crystal structures of a new polymorph and seven new derivatives of 2-(1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine have been characterized and examined along with three structures from the literature to identify trends in their intermolecular contact patterns and packing arrangements in order to develop an insight into the crystallization behaviour of this class of compound. Seven unique C-H···X contacts were identified in the structures and three of these are present in four or more structures, indicating that these are reliable supramolecular synthons. Analysis of the packing arrangements of the molecules using XPac identified two closely related supramolecular constructs that are present in eight of the 11 structures; in all cases, the structures feature at least one of the three most common intermolecular contacts, suggesting a clear relationship between the intermolecular contacts and the packing arrangements of the structures. Both the intermolecular contacts and packing arrangements appear to be remarkably consistent between structures featuring different functional groups, with the expected exception of the carboxylic acid derivative 4-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl) benzoic acid (L11), where the introduction of a strong hydrogen-bonding group results in a markedly different supramolecular structure being adopted. The occurrence of these structural features has been compared with the packing efficiency of the structures and their melting points in order to assess the relative favourability of the supramolecular structural features in stabilizing the crystal structures.",

    "abstract": "The intermetallic compound Cu3Sn has previously been described as a long-period antiphase boundary superstructure of the Cu3Ti structure type. While the compound itself has been reported as a tenfold and an eightfold superstructure, ternary doped alloys show shorter repetitions. Interestingly, the diffraction patterns of these compounds show non-crystallographic absences that cannot be explained using the superstructure models. Since the compound exhibits phase broadening, these models are not satisfactory because the paucity of observed data does not allow for a refinement of the composition. Here, an alternative, superspace model in the orthorhombic space group Xmcm(0β0)000 is proposed, with the centering vectors (0,0,0,0) and (½,0,0,½). The presence of the non-crystallographic absences is explained as a result of a dominating occupational modulation that is accompanied by a weaker displacive modulation. In consistency with the EDXS results, the composition has been refined to Cu3 + xSn from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. It is further demonstrated that by varying the length and the direction of the modulation wavevector in the superspace model, the ternary Cu3Sn compounds and other colored hexagonal close packing (h.c.p.) structures can be produced.",

    "abstract": "Plagioclase feldspars are the most abundant mineral in the Earth's crust. Intermediate plagioclase feldspars commonly display incommensurately modulated or aperiodic structures. Z-contrast images show both Ca-Na ordering and density modulation. The local structure of lamellae domains has I1-like symmetry. The neighboring lamellae domains are in an inversion twinning relationship. With a state-of-the-art X-ray diffraction unit, second-order satellite reflections (f-reflections) are observed for the first time in andesine (An45), a Na-rich e-plagioclase. The f-reflections indicate a structure with a density modulation which is close to a Ca-rich e-plagioclase. The similarity between this e-andesine structure and previously solved e-labradorite structure is confirmed. Refinement of the structure shows density modulation of ∼ 7 mol % in compositional variation of the anorthite (An) component. The results from Z-contrast imaging and low-temperature single X-ray diffraction (XRD) provide a structure consistent with density modulation. The discovery of f-reflections in Na-rich e-plagioclase extends the composition range of e1 structure with density modulation to as low as at least An45, which is the lower end of the composition range of Bøggild intergrowth. The new result supports the loop-shaped solvus for Bøggild intergrowth, below which is a homogenous stable area for e1 structure in the phase diagram. The phase transition between e2 structure without density modulation and e1 structure with density modulation should happen at low temperature. There is a change in modulation period accompanying the phase transition, as well as higher occupancy of Al in the T1o site. The andesine with density modulation also indicates extremely slow cooling of its host rock.",

The point he raised is important because it challenges the scientific production of a very active community. The question whether this kind of investigation is still sensible is intriguing and it fosters a multifaceted answer. Granted that none can predict the future of any field of science, but an alternative point of view emerges after answering three questions: Why should we investigate the electron charge (and spin) density? Is the interpretative scheme proposed by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules useful? Is an experimental charge density necessary?",

    "abstract": "Variations in mean bond length are examined in oxide and oxysalt crystals for 55 cation configurations bonded to O 2− . Stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that mean bond length is correlated to bond-length distortion in 42 ion configurations at the 95% confidence level, with a mean coefficient of determination (〈 R 2 〉) of 0.35. Previously published correlations between mean bond length and mean coordination number of the bonded anions are found not to be of general applicability to inorganic oxide and oxysalt structures. For two of 11 ions tested for the 95% confidence level, mean bond lengths predicted using a fixed radius for O 2− are significantly more accurate as those predicted using an O 2− radius dependent on coordination number, and are statistically identical otherwise. As a result, the currently accepted ionic radii for O 2− in different coordinations are not justified by experimental data. Previously reported correlation between mean bond length and the mean electronegativity of the cations bonded to the oxygen atoms of the coordination polyhedron is shown to be statistically insignificant; similar results are obtained with regard to ionization energy. It is shown that a priori bond lengths calculated for many ion configurations in a single structure-type leads to a high correlation between a priori and observed mean bond lengths, but a priori bond lengths calculated for a single ion configuration in many different structure-types leads to negligible correlation between a priori and observed mean bond lengths. This indicates that structure type has a major effect on mean bond length, the magnitude of which goes beyond that of the other variables analyzed here.",

The crystal structure of metronidazole has been determined from high-resolution X-ray diffraction measurements at 90 K with a resolution of (sin θ/λ)max = 1.12 Å-1. To understand the charge-density distribution and the electrostatic properties of metronidazole, a multipole model refinement was carried out using the Hansen-Coppens multipole formalism. The topological analysis of the electron density of metronidazole was performed using Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules to determine the electron density and the Laplacian of the electron density at the bond critical point of the molecule. The experimental results have been compared with the corresponding periodic theoretical calculation performed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level using CRYSTAL09. The topological analysis reveals that the N-O and C-NO2 exhibit less electron density as well as negative Laplacian of electron density. The molecular packing of crystal is stabilized by weak and strong inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding and H...H interactions. The topological analysis of O-H...N, C-H...O and H...H intra- and intermolecular interactions was also carried out. The electrostatic potential of metronidazole, calculated from the experiment, predicts the possible electrophilic and nucleophilic sites of the molecule; notably, the hydroxyl and the nitro groups exhibit large electronegative regions.

The atomic pair distributions show the first peak at 1.90 Å due to the Te—O equatorial bonds and the Te—O peak is asymmetrical due to the range of Te—O bond lengths in glass, anti-glass and crystalline samples. The short-range structural properties of glasses such as Te—O bond lengths, Te–O speciation, Te–Te distances and O—Te—O bond angle distributions were determined by RMC simulations. The average Te–O coordination number ( N Te–O ) for 5SrO–95TeO 2 glass is 3.93 which decreases to 3.59 on increasing the SrO concentration to 10 mol.%. The changes in N Te–O revealed that the glass network predominantly contains TeO 4 units with a small amount of TeO 3 units and there is a structural transformation TeO 4 → TeO 3 with an increase in SrO concentration. The O—Te—O bond angle distributions have a peak at 79° and reveal that the O equatorial —Te—O equatorial bonds are the most abundant linkages in the tellurite network. Two glass samples containing 7.5 and 8.5 mol.% of SrO were annealed at 350°C for 1 h to produce anti-glass phases; they were further annealed at 450°C for 4 h to transform them into crystalline phases. The anti-glass samples are disordered cubic SrTe 5 O 11 and the disordered monoclinic SrTeO 3 phases, whereas the crystalline samples contain monoclinic SrTeO 3 and the orthorhombic TeO 2 phases. The unit-cell parameters of the anti-glass and crystalline structures were determined by Fullprof Rietveld refinement.

In the modulated structure the independent molecules are differentiated by small translations, rotations, and/or conformational changes but an approximate translational relationship is normally retained. A program has been written to identify such pseudotranslations because they can be difficult to find by eye and because they combine with each other and with lattice translations in ways that can be confusing. To characterize the pseudotranslations the program calculates their fractional translational, orientational, and conformational components as well as several quality indicators. While many pseudotranslations are obvious, others are borderline; setting tolerances for identifying a pseudotranslation proved difficult. Defaults were chosen to reproduce experience-based judgment but they can be varied in the program input. The program was run for organic and for metallo-organic structures with R ≤ 0.075 in the 2019 release of the Cambridge Structural Database. The frequency of pseudotranslations increases with Z' and is approximately 50% for Z' > 4. Some structures were found in which an identified pseudotranslation cannot correspond to a modulation. These include structures in which some but not all of the molecules are related by pseudotranslations and structures in which pseudotranslations in different parts of the unit cell have different directions.",

    "abstract": "Three new N-benzylideneaniline derivatives [p-nitrobenzylidene-p-phenylamineaniline (I), 2,4-dinitrobenzylidene-p-phenylamineaniline (II) and p-dinitrobenzylidene-p-diethylamineaniline (III)] containing electron-push-pull groups have been prepared. They present a planar N-benzylideneaniline core and neighbouring functional atoms, which are related through an efficient intramolecular charge transfer (CT). Two of the derivatives crystallize in non-centrosymmetric space groups, a necessary condition for non-linear optical (NLO) responses. The NLO properties were calculated for the molecular conformations determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction as well as for the four molecules packed into each corresponding unit cell, using a quantum-chemical method at the cam-B3LYP/NLO-V level of theory. As expected from antiparallel face-to-face stacking through centrosymmetry, the main NLO descriptors - namely, the first hyperpolarizability (βtot) and its projection on the dipole moment direction (βvec) - are almost zero for the tetramer of derivative III. Interestingly, the calculated first hyperpolarizability decreases in the non-centrosymmetric unit-cell content of derivative II when compared to its single molecule, which may be related to its molecular pillaring, similar to that observed in derivative III. On the other hand, a desirable magnification of the NLO properties was found for packed units of derivative I, which may be a consequence of its parallel face-to-tail stacking with the CT vectors of all molecules pointing in the same direction. Moreover, the CT vector of compound I makes an angle of θ = 33.6° with its crystal polar axis, resulting in a higher-order parameter (cos(3)θ = 0.6) compared with the other derivatives. This is in line with the higher macroscopic second-order NLO response predicted for derivative I, βtot = 120.4 × 10(-30) e.s.u.",

Crystal structure parameters were accurately determined using 10,000 eV photons, and the Pr occupancy was refined using data collected with 5962 eV photons, close to the Pr LIII absorption edge. BaCe1 - xPrxO3 - δ crystallizes in the Pnma (No. 62) space group for all x values. Pr cations are mainly located at the Ce sites (perovskites B site), but a small fraction of them increasingly substitute some of the Ba ions at the A site as Pr content increases. The Pr doping introduces electronic defects (Pr(+3)/Pr(+4)) and oxygen vacancies needed for H2O incorporation and H-ionic conductivity. A decrease in the orthorhombic distortion would produce the opposite effects on the electronic and ionic mobility. The electronic mobility should increase due to an improvement in the overlap of the (Ce/Pr)4f-O2p orbital, while the proton mobility should decrease as a consequence of a larger hopping distance.",

    "abstract": "Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), through their favourable donor/acceptor spatial distribution and synthon formation flexibility, are attractive building blocks in modern materials crystallography. The optical properties of a crystal strongly depend on two factors, i.e. the spatial distribution of molecules in the crystal structure and the electronic properties of molecular building blocks (dipole moments, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities). Although the latter are easy to predict through ab initio calculations, the former are not. Only a combination of experimental and theoretical charge density studies together with prediction and measurement of optical properties enable full analysis of the obtained functional material in terms of its usefulness in practical applications. This article presents design strategies of optical materials based on selected pharmaceutical molecules. Factors that contribute to molecular recognition in the four selected polar/chiral crystal phases (derived through charge density and Hirshfeld surfaces analysis) have been determined. Theoretically predicted optical properties of the molecular/ionic building blocks as well as bulk effects have been confirmed experimentally. This research is a first step in the design of novel optical materials based on push-pull molecules and APIs.",

A large linearity range, high dynamic and extremely low noise leading to an unprecedented high signal-to-noise ratio, fast readout time (high frame rates) and an electronic shutter are among their intrinsic characteristics which render them very attractive. First used on synchrotron beamlines, these detectors are also promising in the laboratory, in particular for pump-probe or quasi-static experiments and accurate electron density measurements, as explained in this paper. An original laboratory diffractometer made from a Nonius Mach3 goniometer equipped with an Incoatec Mo microsource and an XPAD pixel area detector has been developed at the CRM2 laboratory. Mo K α accurate charge density quality data up to 1.21 Å −1 resolution have been collected on a sodium nitroprusside crystal using this home-made diffractometer. Data quality for charge density analysis based on multipolar modelling are discussed in this paper. Deformation electron densities are compared to those already published (based on data collected with CCD APEXII and CAD4 diffractometers).",

    "abstract": "The industrial importance of the U-Al-Si system stems from the fact that during processing the Al-based alloy (containing Si as impurity), used for the cladding of U (fuel in nuclear reactors), undergoes heat treatment which stimulates diffusion between the fuel and the cladding. One of the possible ways to represent the ternary U-Al-Si phase diagram is the construction of an UAl3-USi3 quasi-binary phase diagram. On the one hand, since the UAl3 and USi3 phases are isostructural, an isomorphous phase diagram is expected; on the other hand, some researchers observed a miscibility gap at lower temperatures. During our study of the UAl3-USi3 quasi-binary phase diagram, a new stable U(Alx,Si1 - x)3 phase was identified. The structure of this phase was determined, using a combination of electron crystallography and powder X-ray diffraction methods, as tetragonal [I4/mmm (No.139) space group], with lattice parameters a = b = 8.347 (1), c = 16.808 (96) Å. Its unit cell has 64 atoms and it can be described as an ordered variant of the U(Al,Si)3 solid solution. A Bärnighausen tree was constructed using the original U(Al,Si)3 structure as an aristotype.",

Further cooling results in the development of an incommensurate ferroelectric phase, followed by a lock-in transition towards a twofold superstructure. Here we present the incommensurately modulated crystal structure of Phz-H2ca at T = 139 K with a symmetry given by the superspace group P2(1)(½ σ(2) ½)0 and σ(2) = 0.5139. The modulation mainly affects the positions of the protons within half of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds that are responsible for the spontaneous polarization in all three low-temperature phases. Evidence for proton transfer in part of the hydrogen bonds is obtained from the correlated dependence on the phase of the modulation of the lengths of bonds involved in resonance stabilization of the acidic anion, and much smaller variations of bond lengths of atoms not involved in the resonance mechanism. Incommensurability is explained as competition between proton transfer favored for single hydrogen bonds on the basis of pKa values and avoiding unfavorable Coulomb repulsion within the lattice of the resulting ionic molecules.",

The exclusively O-donor-based coordination sphere around the metal cations is completed by aqua ligands; the halides remain uncoordinated and act as counter-anions for the cationic strands. Despite the differences in ionic radii and electronic structure between the main group and the transition metal cation, their derivatives with L-alanine share a common structure type. In contrast, the solids derived from DL-alanine differ and adopt structures depending on the metal cation and the halide. Homochiral chains of either chirality or heterochiral chains with different arrangements of crystallographic inversion centres along the polymer strands are encountered. On average, the six-coordinated Ca(II) cations, devoid of any ligand field effect, show more pronounced deviation from idealized octahedral geometry than the d-block cation Mn(II).",

To understand this unusual transformation it is necessary to assume electron transfer from the outer core band to the valence band, and an increase of valence electron number for calcium from 2 to ∼ 3.5. This assumption is supported by the Fermi sphere-Brillouin zone interaction model that increases under compression. The recently found structure of Ca-VII with a tetragonal cell containing 32 atoms (tI32) is similar to that in the intermetallic compound In5Bi3 with 3.75 valence electrons per atom.

The data was collected up to a resolution of 1.31 Å −1 with high completeness (89.1%; R mrg = 0.0274). The multipolar refinement and subsequent quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis resulted in a comprehensive description of the charge density distribution in the crystal studied. The residual density maps are flat and almost featureless. It was possible to derive reliable information on intermolecular interactions to model the anharmonic motion of a water molecule, and also to observe the fine details of the charge density distribution, such as polarization on O and H atoms involved in the strongest hydrogen bonds. When compared with our previous statistical study on oxalic acid data collected with the aid of CCD cameras, the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) detector can certainly be classified as a promising alternative in advanced X-ray diffraction studies.",

The product from this procedure has not been extensively characterized. Using a combination of diffraction methods (X-ray and neutron) and inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy, we show that the CuH from the borohydride route has the same bulk structure as CuH produced by other routes.

Na occupies all tunnels. The so-determined structure excellently explains previous reports on the electrochemistry of (Na,□)5[MnO2]13. The trivalent Mn3+ ions concentrate at two of the seven Mn sites where larger Mn-O distances and Jahn-Teller distortion are observed.

    "abstract": "γ-Alumina is a widely used material, while its precise crystal structure and transformation mechanism derived from boehmite have remained unclear in the literature for decades. In this work, quantitative electron microscopy has been applied to study the crystalline structure of γ-alumina and its transformation mechanism from boehmite. Based on Rietveld refinement of electron diffraction patterns, a new tetragonal structure model, with a space group of I 4 1 / amd (No. 141), was proposed for the γ-alumina phase, with Al cations on 4 a , 8 c , 8 d and 16 g sites and O anions on the 16 h site, which could provide better fits than current models. During the boehmite to γ-alumina transformation induced by e-beam irradiation, when the boehmite layers were oriented along the edge-on direction, a shrinkage caused by dehydration was directly observed. Two kinds of boehmite to γ-alumina transformation mechanisms, namely collapse and reaction mechanisms, were elucidated crystallographically in detail with new insights through an intermediate structure, and the reaction mechanism was demonstrated to produce much reduced changes in dimensions and volume, compared with the collapse mechanism. The experimental observations supported the reaction mechanism, which occurred through partial occupation of the dehydrated space by diffusion in the initial stage of the transformation, without the formation of voids that only appeared after the initial stage. Filling tetrahedral interstices of the intermediate structure with Al cations in different ways yields tetragonal or cubic γ-alumina structures, and the tetragonal structure is energetically favorable because of smaller lattice distortions required, compared with the cubic structure. The crystallographic orientation relationships of γ-alumina with the parent boehmite phase deduced from the proposed mechanisms are consistent with the experimental observations.",

The higher-symmetric CuII3TeVIO6-1C polytype is cubic, space group Ia3, with a = 9.537 (1) Å and V = 867.4 (3) Å3 as reported in previous studies. The 1C polytype is a well characterized structure consisting of alternating layers of CuIIO6 octahedra and both CuIIO6 and TeVIO6 octahedra in a patchwork arrangement. The structure of the lower-symmetric orthorhombic CuII3TeVIO6-2O polytype was determined for the first time in this study by 3D ED and verified by Rietveld refinement. The 2O polytype crystallizes in space group Pcca, with a = 9.745 (3) Å, b = 9.749 (2) Å, c = 9.771 (2) Å and V = 928.3 (4) Å3. High-precision XRPD data were also collected on CuII3TeVIO6-2O to verify the lower-symmetric structure by performing a Rietveld refinement. The resultant structure is identical to that determined by 3D ED, with unit-cell parameters a = 9.56157 (19) Å, b = 9.55853 (11) Å, c = 9.62891 (15) Å and V = 880.03 (2) Å3. The lower symmetry of the 2O polytype is a consequence of a different cation ordering arrangement, which involves the movement of every second CuIIO6 and TeVIO6 octahedral layer by (1/4, 1/4, 0), leading to an offset of TeVIO6 and CuIIO6 octahedra in every second layer giving an ABAB* stacking arrangement. Syntheses of CuII3TeVIO6 showed that low-temperature (473 K) hydrothermal conditions generally produce the 2O polytype. XRPD measurements in combination with Raman spectroscopic analysis showed that most natural mcalpineite is the orthorhombic 2O polytype. Both XRPD and Raman spectroscopy measurements may be used to differentiate between the two polytypes of CuII3TeVIO6. In Raman spectroscopy, CuII3TeVIO6-1C has a single strong band around 730 cm-1, whereas CuII3TeVIO6-2O shows a broad double maximum with bands centred around 692 and 742 cm-1.",

    "abstract": "A method of ab initio crystal structure determination from powder diffraction data for organic and metal-organic compounds, which does not require prior indexing of the powder pattern, has been developed. Only a reasonable molecular geometry is required, needing knowledge of neither unit-cell parameters nor space group. The structures are solved from scratch by a global fit to the powder data using the new program FIDEL-GO (`FIt with DEviating Lattice parameters - Global Optimization'). FIDEL-GO uses a similarity measure based on cross-correlation functions, which allows the comparison of simulated and experimental powder data even if the unit-cell parameters deviate strongly. The optimization starts from large sets of random structures in various space groups. The unit-cell parameters, molecular position and orientation, and selected internal degrees of freedom are fitted simultaneously to the powder pattern. The optimization proceeds in an elaborate multi-step procedure with built-in clustering of duplicate structures and iterative adaptation of parameter ranges. The best structures are selected for an automatic Rietveld refinement. Finally, a user-controlled Rietveld refinement is performed. The procedure aims for the analysis of a wide range of `problematic' powder patterns, in particular powders of low crystallinity. The method can also be used for the clustering and screening of a large number of possible structure candidates and other application scenarios. Examples are presented for structure determination from unindexed powder data of the previously unknown structures of the nanocrystalline phases of 4,11-difluoro-, 2,9-dichloro- and 2,9-dichloro-6,13-dihydro-quinacridone, which were solved from powder patterns with 14-20 peaks only, and of the coordination polymer dichloro-bis(pyridine-N)copper(II).",

(Mo 2/3 Ho 1/3 ) 2 GaC crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm . The material undergoes two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at T N1 = 10 K and T N2 = 7.2 K. The magnetic structure below T N1 is incommensurate with the propagation vector k 1 = (0, k y , 0) with k y = 0.696 (1) at 9 K. For the analysis of the magnetic structure, a group-theoretical approach based on the space group of the nuclear structure and its subgroups was employed. A model in the (3+1)D superspace group Cmcm .1′(0β0) s 0 ss yielded the most accurate results in neutron powder diffraction refinements. The determined structure was found to be an incommensurate longitudinal amplitude-modulated magnetic structure. Below T N2 , additional magnetic satellites develop. They could be indexed by a propagation vector k 2 = (τ x , 0, 0) with the τ x value increasing below T N2 until it stabilizes at approximately 3 K at 0.075. A magnetic structure determination considering two propagation vectors k 1 and k 2 was carried out using the superspace formalism by building the corresponding (3+2)D model. The determination was based on the observation that the additional magnetic peaks emerge exclusively in the vicinity of the incommensurate magnetic peaks with propagation vector k 1 , and not in the vicinity of nuclear peaks. This indicates that only mixed-index reflections were observed, and not reflections purely related to k 2 . The magnetic superspace group (MSSG) that was determined is Amma .1′ (0,β,0)00 s 0 (0,0,γ) ss 0 s . The structure can be described as a longitudinal amplitude-modulated structure, which itself is amplitude-modulated in a perpendicular direction. This represents a very unusual case of a 2- k magnetic structure with no symmetry relation between the propagation vectors.",

    "abstract": "The crystallographic phase change from tetragonal litharge (α-PbO; P 4/ nmm ) to orthorhombic massicot (β-PbO; Pbcm ) has been studied by full-matrix Rietveld analysis of high-temperature neutron powder diffraction data collected in equal steps from ambient temperature up to 925 K and back down to 350 K. The phase transformation takes place between 850 and 925 K, with the coexisting phases having equal abundance by weight at 885 K. The product massicot remains metastable on cooling to near ambient temperature. Both structures are layered networks of OPb 4 tetrahedra and PbO 4 square pyramids, with the space between alternate layers of Pb atoms (in approximate cubic close packing) occupied either by O atom layers or Pb atom lone pairs. In massicot, the symmetric Pb and O layers of litharge become deeply corrugated parallel to [001], with the O-atom layers splitting into two layers, although these are still sandwiched between the approximately cubic close-packed Pb atom layers. The crystallite size of the initial litharge component decreases from around 3500 Å to around 1100 Å at the midpoint of the phase change at 885 K, whereupon the size of the massicot crystallites increases from a similar value to around 2500 Å at 350 K during the cool-down stage. The unit-cell dimensions and atomic coordinates of litharge change smoothly throughout the phase change, but there is a rapid expansion of the c -axis immediately prior to the recrystallization to massicot, and the one free coordinate (Pb z ) decreases significantly to producer a thinning of the layers. Increases in the O displacment parameters suggest that this atom is `on the move' as the transformation approaches. Changes in the massicot parameters as its crystallites emerge from the transformation are largely unremarkable. The formation of the heavily corrugated layers in massicot requires significant movements of the O atoms (∼1.2 Å) from their positions in litharge and thus for Pb—O bonds to be broken during the phase change. The requirement for these bonds to be re-broken in a conversion back to litharge is likely to be the reason why massicot is metastable at ambient temperature. Evidence of a temporary intermediate `amorphous' phase in the phase transformation from which the massicot grows is provided in the form of broad, very low amplitude `peaks' in the high-temperature diffraction patterns.",

The observed variation in the polyhedral volume and distortion of the M 2 octahedron as a function of Li/Fe 3+ doping suggests the presence of an upper limit, at least for the OPX samples.

It seems that the M 2 octahedron plays a crucial role in stabilizing the pyroxene topology in either the PEN or the OEN form, because the PPX and OPX samples show two distinct linear relations between the M 2O 6 polyhedral volume and 〈 M 2—O〉, with the PPX trend converging toward the parameters of the LiFe 3+ Si 2 O 6 endmember, whereas the OPX trend, including OEN, diverges largely from these parameters.",

A new feature of the database allows for the inclusion of ions on the protein backbone, effectively simulating a protein salt and predicting the impact on electrical properties. Glucagon was selected as a proof-of-concept molecule due to its relatively small chain, which enabled benchmarking against quantum mechanical calculations. Firstly, we simulated 70 different ionic configurations, varying the number of Na + and Cl − ions from zero to four NaCl moieties. Additionally, we investigated the effects of solvation under two distinct conditions: one involving just the peptide and water, and the other also including NaCl at a concentration of approximately 4.2 mol L −1 . Regarding the ab initio results, GruPol showed good accuracy, with an angular direction error of around 10° and a 15% difference in the magnitude of the dipole moments. However, the error in polarizability values was higher, most likely due to the lack of an augmented basis set in the ab initio quantum calculations (M06-HF/cc-pVDZ). The database entries were generated using the same functional along with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. In solution, a high ionic concentration lowered the overall dipole moment, while the main components of polarizability increased.",

    "abstract": "Pharmaceutical solid forms, like salts and cocrystals, play a crucial role in drug formulation. Despite differing mainly by a single hydrogen atom, the regulatory requirements set by the US Food and Drug Administration for these forms vary significantly. We previously developed a DFT-based computational method to distinguish salts from cocrystals. This method, validated on 95 structures, performed well for systems where hydrogen bonds were longer than 2.613 (16) Å. Here, benefits of the rSCAN functional over the PBE functional are discussed. We expand the dataset to 404 cocrystal models. Analysis confirms that 301 of these forms are indeed cocrystals. Additionally, 87 salt–cocrystal continuum forms are identified and 16 cocrystals are classified as possible salts. These 16 problematic structures are further investigated and for seven of them, single crystals were grown and their structure determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Among the phases exhibiting salt-like behaviour, five of them are identified as salts. In some cases, rSCAN alone gives unreliable results for strong hydrogen bonds, but these discrepancies are often corrected using better-renormalized or hybrid functionals ( i.e. r2SCAN, PBE0 and PBE50). For future calculations, we recommend using the r2SCAN functional for salt–cocrystal differentiation, as it provides reliable results for O—H...N bonds longer than 2.554 (5) Å. The r2SCAN functional offers a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for systems with longer O—H...N bonds.",

    "abstract": "A total of nine isomeric trifluoromethyl- and cyano-substituted N -phenylbenzamides were synthesized, by changing the position of the –CF 3 /–CN groups, from ortho to meta to para on the molecular scaffold, to obtain different isomeric molecules. These molecules were prepared via the reaction of cyano-substituted aniline and trifluoromethyl-substituted benzoyl chloride followed by crystallization of the obtained compounds. Furthermore, the solid-state structures of the synthesized compounds were determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction to investigate the molecular conformation and supramolecular assembly in the solid state. There exist changes in the molecular conformation of different molecules with subsequent changes in the packing of molecules in the crystal structure. The crystal packing of molecules revealed that the crystal structures are primarily stabilized via N—H/C—H...O chains. In some of the crystal structures, this chain is absent, instead O...π and N—H...N interactions are primarily responsible for the packing of molecules in the crystal. The molecular electrostatic surface potential revealed the reduction in the amphoteric character of the cyano group compared to the previously reported ethynyl group in N -phenylbenzamides, resulting in more electron-donor ability of the former to form multiple weak C—H/N—H...(–C≡N) intermolecular interactions. In addition, due to the presence of the trifluoromethyl group, fluorine-centered interactions, such as C—H...F—C( sp 3 ), C( sp 3 )–F...π and C( sp 3 )—F...F—C( sp 3 ) cumulatively stabilized the packing of molecules in the solid state. One compound crystallized as concomitant dimorphs, and these constitute packing polymorphs on account of the different arrangement of the molecules in the solid state. The energy landscape of the unsubstituted N -phenylbenzamide polymorphophore was generated by mapping of the crystal structure landscape (CSL) via the crystal structure prediction method, and several hypothetical crystal structures have been accessed from the CSL and mapped with the experimentally determined crystal structures of CN- and CF 3 -substituted benzamides.",

The superposition of electrostatic potential and electron-density gradient fields suggests the indirect mechanism of anion interactions with each other through ligands.

The elastic properties modelled based on the structural information are in agreement with the experimental structural data.

    "abstract": "Manipulating the size and orientation of quantum materials is often used to tune emergent phenomena, but precise control of these parameters is also necessary from an experimental point of view. Various synthesis techniques already exist, such as epitaxial thin film growth and chemical etching, that are capable of producing specific sample dimensions with high precision. However, certain materials exist as single crystals that are often difficult to manipulate, thereby limiting their studies to a certain subset of experimental techniques. One particular class of these materials includes lithium and sodium iridates, which are promising candidates for hosting a Kitaev quantum spin liquid state. Here a controlled method of using a focused ion beam at grazing incidence to reduce the size of a β-Li 2 IrO 3 single crystal to a thickness of 1–2 µm is presented. Subsequent X-ray diffraction measurements show the lattice remains intact, albeit with a larger mosaic spread. The integrity of the magnetic order is also preserved as the temperature dependent magnetic diffraction peak follows the same trend as its bulk counterpart with a transition temperature at T N = 37.5 K. Our study demonstrates a technique that opens up the possibility of nonequilibrium experiments where submicron thin samples are often essential.",

    "abstract": "Due to their potential applications in low-power consumption and/or multistate memory devices, multiferroic materials have attracted a lot of attention in the condensed matter community. As part of the effort to identify new multiferroic compounds, perovskite-based GdCrO 3 was studied in both bulk and thin film samples. A strong enhancement of the capacitance in a field suggested ferroelectric behaviour but significant leakage and no well developed P – E hysteresis loops were observed. Measurements clearly indicate the existence of a polar phase but only below 2 K (likely connected to Gd ordering). Here the determination of the magnetic structure through neutron diffraction collected on an isotopic 160 GdCrO 3 sample at the WISH diffractometer at ISIS is reported. The presence of three successive magnetic phases as a function of temperature (commensurate, spin re-orientation and incommensurate phases once the Gd order), previously only seen by magnetization, is confirmed. Using the most recent guidelines for reporting the determined structures, we highlight the benefits of using such nomenclature for discussing physical properties and consider possible mechanisms and couplings that led this seemingly rather isotropic system to display the complex structures observed.",

    "abstract": "Single crystals of a previously unknown caesium calcium silicate with the composition Ca 4 Ca[Si 8 O 19 ] have been obtained during a systematic study of the phase relations and compound formation in the system Cs 2 O–CaO–SiO 2 . Structure determination was based on a single-crystal diffraction data set recorded at 288 (2) K. The compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P 2 1 / n and has the following basic crystallographic parameters: a = 7.1670 (6) Å, b = 12.0884 (10) Å, c = 12.4019 (10) Å, β = 90.044 (8)°, V = 1074.47 (15) Å 3 , Z = 2. The crystal structure was solved by direct methods. The sample showed twinning by pseudo-merohedry, which was accounted for in the subsequent least-squares refinements resulting in a residual of R 1 = 0.036 for 1962 independent observed reflections and 149 parameters. The crystal structure of Cs 4 Ca[Si 8 O 19 ] belongs to the group of interrupted framework silicates, in which the [SiO 4 ] tetrahedra are linked in a three-dimensional network consisting of Q 4 and Q 3 groups in a 1:3 ratio. The linear backbones of the framework can be described as loop-branched dreier single chains. These ribbons are parallel to [100], and the translation period of about 7.2 Å along this axis reflects the periodicity of the chains. By sharing common corners, the condensation of these chains along the [001] direction leads to the formation of layers that are parallel to (010) and contain three- and nine-membered rings of tetrahedra. Alternatively, the crystal structure can be described as a mixed tetrahedral–octahedral framework between [SiO 4 ] tetrahedra and [CaO 6 ] octahedra containing cavities accommodating the caesium ions coordinated by seven and eight oxygen ligands, respectively. A detailed topological analysis of the mixed framework based on natural tiles is presented. Indeed, the net can be constructed from a total of only two different cages (tiles) having the following face symbols: [4 3 ] and [3 4 .4 6 .6 2 .7 8 ]. A comparison with related silicates containing [Si 8 O 19 ] anions and already classified as well as hitherto unclassified interrupted frameworks is presented. Finally, the thermal expansion tensor has been determined in the temperature interval between 193 K to 288 (2) K.",

A comparison of the properties obtained under different resolution and acquisition conditions are presented. The performance of these models is evaluated in terms of their ability to achieve bond lengths close to those from neutron diffraction, provide accurate anisotropic displacement parameters and model electron densities precisely, and to determine atomic charges under different experimental and modeling conditions. The structure presents a short intramolecular hydrogen bond, which is found to have a distinct character compared to other interactions, as the hydrogen interacts covalently with two oxygen atoms. Different models were evaluated, each outperforming the others in specific aspects.

Calorimetric data and crystal structure determination across the phase transition temperature establish the order–disorder phase transition. (CH 3 CH 2 NH 3 ) 2 [MnCl 4 ] undergoes the reversible structural phase transition from tetragonal I 4/ mmm to orthorhombic Pbca at 212/222 K (cooling/heating), whereas (CH 3 CH 2 NH 3 ) 2 CoCl 4 demonstrates the phase transition at 220/239 K from orthorhombic Pnma to orthorhombic P 2 1 2 1 2 1 . Both compounds are characterized by disordered ethyl ammonium cations in the structure above the phase transition temperature, whereas they become ordered cations at temperatures below the phase transition. Dielectric results further support the observed structural phase transitions. Additionally, magnetic measurements show canted antiferromagnetic characteristics for (CH 3 CH 2 NH 3 ) 2 [MnCl 4 ] and paramagnetic behaviour is observed for (CH 3 CH 2 NH 3 ) 2 [CoCl 4 ]. The structural differences, the role of intermolecular interactions and the effect of transition metals on the phase transition were evaluated using Hirshfeld surface analysis and the topological properties of electron density distributions.

    "abstract": "The change in symmetry Fd 3 m → Cc at the Verwey transition in magnetite puts it in a class of phase transitions with linear/quadratic coupling between two separate order parameters. Direct coupling between an order parameter Q e , to represent an electronic instability, and an order parameter Q co , to represent cation charge ordering, has the form λ Q e Q co 2 , with T c ( Q e ) &lt; T c ( Q co ), but there must also be indirect coupling through the common strain, e 6 , due to strain coupling terms λ e 6 Q e and λ e 6 Q co 2 . Q e has the symmetry of irrep Γ 5 + while the pattern of cation charge ordering of Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ on octahedral sites depends on some combination of irreps Δ 5 , X 1 , X 3 , W 1 and W 2 . The software package ISOVIZ has been used to show how reported patterns of order for the simplified structure in space group P 2/ c can be understood in terms of a linearly dependent mix of patterns with symmetry Δ 5 and X 1 , so that Q co can be treated in the first instance as though it has the symmetry of Δ 5 . Spontaneous strains calculated from published lattice parameters and symmetry-adapted atomic displacements from previous structural refinements in space group Cc have been used to confirm that the two order parameters have different temperature dependences, consistent with this phenomenological treatment. The effect of chemical doping can be understood in terms of the development of local strain heterogeneity which acts to suppress the macroscopic strains and which appears to have a greater influence on charge ordering than on the electronic structure.",

The experiment was conducted at 550°C, 200 MPa, at an oxygen fugacity approximately equivalent to the Ni-NiO (NNO) buffer with NaF and Ca(PO4)2 added to the hydrous fluid. Both phases formed as a replacement of chevkinite-(Ce) and earlier alteration products. Their identity was confirmed by electron probe microanalysis and electron backscatter diffraction as CNa analogues of turkestanite and steacyite. Further SCXRD, and Raman spectroscopy analyses confirmed that it is a new CNa analogue with respect to the ekanite mineral group. Raman spectroscopy revealed the presence of H2O within the crystal structure. A dedicated FIB workflow was designed to extract single crystals ready for SCXRD analysis. Compositionally, the phase is Na rich and depleted in K, REE and Fe. The mean formula based on 20 O atoms can be written as A(Th0.94U0.03)0.97B(Na0.96Ca0.90Mn0.11Ce0.02Nd0.01Fe0.01)2.0C(Na0.83K0.07)0.9TSi8.05O20·0.1C(H2O).

It is also the second example of K/Ca disorder coupled with orientational disorder of carbonate anions. Descriptions based on the most symmetric (tri/hexagonal) and the densest ( krd -type) cation–carbon nets reveal its peculiarities and common features with the crystal structures of chemically related carbonates. The four-layered ABA ′ B packing in K 8 Ca 3 (CO 3 ) 7 is based on hexagonal cation nets, wherein carbon atoms occupy two types of positions. Most of the carbon atoms are localized close to net B , within the centers of triangular loops. This forms a bütschliite layer, which is found in other alkali-bearing carbonates and is composed of alkali cations. Its presence in the K 8 Ca 3 (CO 3 ) 7 crystal structure implies that the K/Ca disorder is incomplete. In nets A and A ′, carbon atoms replace the cations at some nodes, resulting in the aggregation and increased concentration of carbon atoms and their stronger mixing with cations in the densest ( krd -type) nets. Thus, a new type of densest mixed net is formed in the K 8 Ca 3 (CO 3 ) 7 crystal structure. A quantitative measure of the packing density of high-pressure K–Ca carbonates is the reticular density of the symmetric atomic nets, as well as the distance between the densest nets.",

With HAR, hydrogen-atom positions are refined freely against the X-ray diffraction data and yield X —H bond distances close to those from neutron diffraction. However, the X-ray data of DDD trihydrate do not contain sufficient information to refine anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) for the hydrogen atoms, although the data quality is comparable to that of typical oligopeptide or protein datasets, including those with disordered fragments. Therefore, the following restraints were tested for the hydrogen-atom ADPs using NoSpherA2 / olex2.refine : a restraint that approximates isotropic behaviour (ISOR), a restraint that enforces similar movement in any direction (SIMU), a rigid-bond restraint (DELU) and an advanced rigid-bond restraint (RIGU). Although it was found that there is no significant influence of the restraint weights and corresponding ADP values on the X —H distances, some recommendations on hydrogen-atom ADP restraint weights to be used in HAR are given. For ISOR, the suggested values are 10 times smaller (stricter) than the default values for non-hydrogen atoms in independent atom model (IAM) refinements, whereas those for RIGU are suggested to be less strict.",

In the CSD 66 contacts of pyridines have a parallel orientation of molecules and most of these pyridines simultaneously form hydrogen bonds (44 contacts). The geometries of stacked pyridines observed in crystal structures were compared with the geometries obtained by calculations and explained by supramolecular structures in crystals. The results show that the mean perpendicular distance (R) between pyridine rings with (3.48 Å) and without hydrogen bonds (3.62 Å) is larger than that calculated, because of the influence of supramolecular structures in crystals. The pyridines with hydrogen bonds show a pronounced preference for offsets of 1.25–1.75 Å, close to the position of the calculated minimum (1.80 Å). However, stacking interactions of pyridines without hydrogen bonds do not adopt values at or close to that of the calculated offset. This is because stacking interactions of pyridines without hydrogen bonds are less strong, and they are more susceptible to the influence of supramolecular structures in crystals. These results show that hydrogen bonding and supramolecular structures have an important influence on the geometries of stacked pyridines in crystals.",

This and the following paper focuses on two additional phenomena: (i) a steric conflict between counter-cations and the cluster-ligand framework resulting in `common' lattice strains (this paper), and (ii) steric conflict between the small (TM)6-cluster and the large coordination polyhedron around the cluster or so-called matrix effect [the next paper; Levi et al. (2013), Acta Cryst. B69, 426-438]. It was shown that both phenomena can be well described by changes in the bond-valence parameters. The calculations were based on the structural data known to date for a variety of (TM)6-cluster compounds, Mx(TM)6Ly (TM = Nb, Mo, W and Re; M = various additional cations, L = the chalcogen and/or halogen ligands). The results were used to explain the structural peculiarities of these compounds with remarkable physical properties and the mechanisms of their stabilization.",

Neither of the structures contain relatively strong classical hydrogen bonds (OH⋯O, NH⋯O, OH⋯N, NH⋯N) and the structure packing is thus determined by a subtle interplay of weaker interactions. Isostructurality of the four halogen analogues is very rare, and in this study —Br, —Cl and —F are found to be isostructural in different degrees, whereas —I is not. Interestingly, although it is closely isostructural to the —Cl and —Br compounds, the F analogue is shown not to form F⋯O bonds, while the Cl and the Br analogues do form Hal⋯O bonds. This raises an important question on the role of Hal⋯O bonds in the structuration of the crystal packing, particularly the stabilization effect. Similarly, while the CH⋯Hal interaction seems to give one-dimensional cohesion in the —Cl and —Br analogues, this feature is absent in the —F analogue, despite its close isostructurality. CH⋯O interactions appear to dominate to a first degree the cohesion between the anionic trifluoromethanesulfonate network and the cationic Zn-pyridinedicarboxaldehydebis(p-R-phenyl­imines) network. The analysis of these interactions is corroborated by reduced density gradient calculations based on promolecular densities.",

From a complete distortion analysis/refinement using high-resolution neutron diffraction data in the temperature range 8 to 613 K, we identified tetragonal structures for BaTaO 2 N [ P 4/ mmm (No. 123)] and SrTaO 2 N [ I 4/ mcm (No. 140)]. In contrast to an anion-disordered cubic perovskite (Pm \\overline{3}m No. 221) with Ta at the cell center, both systems show a site preference for oxygen anions in the two opposite corners (along the c axis) of the Ta–O/N octahedra rather than the four square corners in the ab plane ( Γ 3 + occupancy distortion), which induces a tetragonal elongation of the unit cell with the c axis being longer than the a axis. A further Ta–O/N octahedra displacement [ R 5 − ( a ,0,0), rotation about the c axis] distortion was observed in SrTaO 2 N. This distortion mode is accompanied by an increased unit-cell distortion that decreases as the temperature increases. Ultimately a second-order phase transition caused by the loss of the R 5 − ( a ,0,0) mode was observed at 400–450 K.",

    "abstract": "The possible occurrence of static/dynamic disorder at the Mg site in pyrope (Mg 3Al 2Si 3O 12), with or without anharmonic contribution to the thermal vibrations even at low temperatures, has been largely debated but conclusions were contrasting. Here a report is given on the experimental charge density distribution, ρ EXP, of synthetic pyrope at T = 30 K, built through a Stewart multipolar expansion up to l = 5 and based on a very precise and accurate set of in-home measured single-crystal X-ray diffraction amplitudes with a maximum resolution of 0.44 Å. Local and integral topological properties of ρ EXP are in substantial agreement with those of ρ THEO, the corresponding DFT-grade quantum charge density of an ideal pyrope crystal, and those derived from synchrotron investigations of chemical bonding in olivines. Relevant thermal atomic displacements, probably anharmonic in nature, clearly affect the whole structure down to 30 K. No significant (> 2.5σ) residual Fourier peaks are detectable from the ρ EXP distribution around Mg, after least-squares refinement of a multipole model with anharmonic thermal motion at the Mg site. Experimental findings were confirmed by a full analysis of normal vibration modes of the DFT-optimized structure of the perfect pyrope crystal. Mg undergoes wide displacements from its equilibrium position even at very low temperatures, as it is allocated in a 4.5 Å large dodecahedral cavity and involved in several soft phonon modes. Implications on the interplay among static/dynamic disorder of Mg and lattice vibrational degrees of freedom are discussed.A very accurate single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of synthetic pyrope (Mg 3Al 2Si 3O 12,) at 30 K reveals that residual density features around Mg 2+ ions, previously attributed to static disorder, can be better accounted for by anharmonicity/dynamic disorder.",

Here a new anhydrous structure and experimental charge density distribution analysis of a uridine-5′-monophosphate potassium salt, K(UMPH), is reported. The studied case constitutes the very first structure of a 5′-nucleotide potassium salt according to the Cambridge Structural Database. The excellent crystal quality allowed the collection of charge density data at various temperatures, i.e. 10, 100, 200 and 300 K on one single crystal. Crystal structure and charge density data were analysed thoroughly in the context of related literature-reported examples. Detailed analysis of the charge density distribution revealed elevated anharmonic motion of part of the uracil ring moiety relatively weakly interacting with the neighbouring species. The effect was manifested by alternate positive and negative residual density patterns observed for these atoms, which `disappear' at low temperature. It also occurred that the potassium cation, quite uniformly coordinated by seven O atoms from all molecular fragments of the UMPH − anion, including the O atom from the ribofuranose ring, can be treated as spherical in the charge density model which was supported by theoretical calculations. Apart from the predominant electrostatic interactions, four relatively strong hydrogen bond types further support the stability of the crystal structure. This results in a compact and quite uniform structure (in all directions) of the studied crystal, as opposed to similar cases with layered architecture reported in the literature.",

The crystal, which is a hydrate salt of the amino acid with the hydrogen-oxalate ion, also contains the zwitterion of the amino acid in equal proportions. It was found that a dimeric cation [Acc5(Z)...Acc5(C)] + bonded by an O—H...O hydrogen bond exists due to a charge transfer between acid and carboxylate groups. The three-dimensional crystal is built by blocks stacked along the [101] direction by dispersion interactions, with each block growing along two directions: a hydrogen oxalate HOX − ...HOX − catameric supramolecular structure along the [010] direction; and double ...HOX − — W —[Acc5(Z)... Acc5(C)] + ... chains related by inversion centers along the [1 0 {\\bar 1}] direction. A PBE-DFT optimization, under periodic boundary conditions, was carried out. The fully optimized structure obtained was used to extract the coordinates to calculate the stabilization energy between the dimers under the crystal field, employing the M062X/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The non-covalent index isosurfaces employed here allow the visualization of where the hydrogen bond and dispersion interactions contribute within the crystal. The crystal atomic arrangements are analyzed by employing the Atoms in Molecules and electron localization function theories. Within this context, the presence of density bond critical points is employed as a criterion for proving the existence of the hydrogen bond and it was found that these results agree with those rendered by the crystallographic geometrical analysis, with only three exceptions, for which bond critical points were not found.",

In this study, neutron time-of-flight single-crystal Laue diffraction analysis was carried out for synthetic hydrous ringwoodite. Hydrogen cations were found only in the sites in MgO 6 octahedra in the ringwoodite structure, which compensated the reduced occupancies of both magnesium and silicon cations.

It was established that the crystal undergoes a diffuse structural phase transition in the temperature range 350-380 K. The complexity of localization of such a transition over temperature was overcome by means of special analysis of systematic extinction reflections by symmetry. The transition temperature can be considered to be Tstr ≃ 370 K. The crystal has a trigonal structure in the space group P3121 at temperatures of 90-370 K, and it has a trigonal structure in the space group R32 at 375-500 K. There is one type of chain formed by the FeO6 octahedra along the c axis in the R32 phase. When going into the P3121 phase, two types of nonequivalent chains arise, in which Fe atoms are separated from the Y atoms by a different distance. Upon lowering the temperature from 500 to 90 K, a distortion of the Y(Bi)O6, FeO6, B(2,3)O3 coordination polyhedra is observed. The distances between atoms in helical Fe chains and Fe-O-Fe angles change non-uniformly. A sharp jump in the equivalent isotropic displacement parameters of O1 and O2 atoms within the Fe-Fe chains and fluctuations of the equivalent isotropic displacement parameters of B2 and B3 atoms were observed in the region of structural transition as well as noticeable elongation of O1, O2, B2, B3, Fe1, Fe2 atomic displacement ellipsoids. It was established that the helices of electron density formed by Fe, O1 and O2 atoms may be structural elements determining chirality, optical activity and multiferroicity of rare-earth iron borates. Compression and stretching of these helices account for the symmetry change and for the manifestation of a number of properties, whose geometry is controlled by an indirect exchange interaction between iron cations that compete with the thermal motion of atoms in the structure. Structural analysis detected these changes as variations of a number of structural characteristics in the c unit-cell direction, that is, the direction of the helices. Structural results for the local surrounding of the atoms in (Y0.95Bi0.05)Fe3(BO3)4 were confirmed by EXAFS and Mössbauer spectroscopies.",

The differences in melting temperatures of these structurally related compounds were rationalized in terms of the hierarchy and nature of formed noncovalent interactions, and the molecular aggregation that is influenced by molecular symmetry. The highest melting point is associated with the highly symmetric 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene isomer. The structures of less symmetrical 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene, determined at 270 and 90 K, show a distinct pattern of halogen bonds, characterized by the different numbers and types of interactions. The evolution of Cl...Cl/H distances with temperature indicates the attractive character of intermolecular interactions and their importance to the structural and thermodynamic parameters of isomeric compounds. The favoured Cl...Cl halogen bonds were found to play a decisive role in differentiating the melting temperatures of tetrachlorobenzene isomers. It was also found that, besides the molecular symmetry and ability to form specific intermolecular interactions, both the type and the distribution of interactions are the important factors responsible for the melting behaviour of the studied isomers. The observed preferences, in tetrachlorobenzenes, for the formation of specific noncovalent interactions correspond to the distribution of calculated partial atomic charges and to the magnitudes of electrostatic potential on the molecular surfaces as well as correlate with the enthalpy of melting parameters.",

The influences of Cl/Br/I and trifluoromethyl substituents on the respective interactions are examined in the presence of a strong N—H...O hydrogen bond. This exercise has resulted in the documentation of frequently occurring supramolecular synthons involving halogen atoms in the crystal packing of benzamide molecules in the solid state. In the present study, a detailed quantitative evaluation has been performed on the nature, energetics, electrostatic contributions, and topological properties of short and directional intermolecular interactions derived from the electron density on halogenated benzamides in the solid state. Besides these, the occurrence of three-, two- and one-dimensional isostructurality in halogen (Cl or Br or I) substituted benzamide analogues is also investigated. A `region of co-existence' involving halogen-based intermolecular interactions in the vicinity of the sum of the van der Waals radii has been identified. Thus, the nature of the halogen (effective size), type of interaction and the packing characteristics via presence of additional interactions establish the subtle, yet important, role of cooperativity in intermolecular interactions in crystal packing.",

Through the comparative investigation of several compounds studied in earlier literature, it is shown that this new model results in large reductions in computational effort (of up to 65%) and in significant increases in reliability.

    "abstract": "The physical properties of organic solids are altered when hydrated (and, more generally, when solvated) and this is of particular significance for pharmaceuticals in application; for instance, the solubility of a hydrate is less than that of its parent. The effective volumes of waters of crystallization for non-ionic pharmaceuticals (where the `effective' volume is the difference per water molecule between the hydrate volume and the volume of the anhydrous parent) are here examined. This investigation contrasts with our earlier study of effective volumes of waters of crystallization for ionic materials where the coulombic forces are paramount. Volumetric properties are significant since they correlate strongly with many thermodynamic properties. Twenty-nine hydrate/parent systems have been identified, and their volumetric properties are reported and analysed (apart from aspartame and ephedrine for which the structural data are inconsistent). Among these systems, the data for paracetamol are extensive and it is possible to differentiate among the volumetric properties of its three polymorphs and to quantify the effect of temperature on their volumes. The effective volumes in both ionic and non-ionic systems are similar, with a median effective volume of 22.8 Å3 for the non-ionic systems compared with 24.2 Å3 for the ionic systems, and both are smaller than the molecular volume of 30 Å3 of ambient liquid water - which appears to be an upper limit to the effective volumes of waters of crystallization under ambient conditions. These results will be supportive in checking and confirmation of hydrated crystal structures and in assessing their thermodynamic properties.",

    "abstract": "The high thermoelectric performance of cuprous selenide (Cu 2 Se) arises from its specific structures consisting of two independent sublattices, i.e. the rigid face-centered cubic (f.c.c.) Se sublattice and the flexible Cu sublattice showing a variety of ordered configurations at numerous interstitial sites. Upon increasing the temperature, the Cu sublattice undergoes an order-to-disorder transition but the details of the structural evolution have not been fully elucidated. Here, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to investigate the thermally induced structural changes of Cu 2 Se in both real and reciprocal spaces. Order–disorder transition was found to proceed in nanoblocks accompanied by the structural fluctuations between low-temperature and high-temperature phases. Electron diffraction revealed the emergence of medium-range ordering of Cu atoms in the high-temperature f.c.c. phase. By referring to the Coulomb interaction evaluations, the superstructures for the medium-range ordering were constructed. Such medium-range atomic ordering was sustained over a wide temperature range (from the phase transition temperature to over 800 K in the TEM) but gradually changed to short-range ordering as indicated by the appearance of diffuse scattering rings.",

    "abstract": "Anthracene derivative compounds are currently investigated because of their unique physical properties ( e.g. bright luminescence and emission tunability), which make them ideal candidates for advanced optoelectronic devices. Intermolecular interactions are the basis of the tunability of the optical and electronic properties of these compounds, whose prediction and exploitation benefit from knowledge of the crystal structure and the packing architecture. Polymorphism can occur due to the weak intermolecular interactions, requiring detailed structural analysis to clarify the origin of observed material property modifications. Here, two silylethyne-substituted anthracene compounds are characterized by single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction, identifying a new polymorph in the process. Additionally, laser confocal microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy confirm the results obtained by the X-ray diffraction characterization, i.e. shifting the substituents towards the external benzene rings of the anthracene unit favours π–π interactions, impacting on both the morphology and the microscopic optical properties of the crystals. The compounds with more isolated anthracene units feature shorter lifetime and emission spectra, more similar to those of isolated molecules. The crystallographic study, supported by the optical investigation, sheds light on the influence of non-covalent interactions on the crystal packing and luminescence properties of anthracene derivatives, providing a further step towards their efficient use as building blocks in active components of light sources and photonic networks.",

    "abstract": "Nylon 5T is one of the bio-based nylons, its raw material 1,5-pentanediamine is derived from biomass resources and produced by biological methods. 1,5-pentanediamine-terephthalate (PDA-TPA) is the monomeric salt for nylon 5T polymerization, and its own product quality has a significant impact on the performance of nylon 5T. PDA-TPA was prepared by anti-solvent crystallization in this study. It exists in two solid forms, a monohydrate [form (I)] and an anhydrous phase [form (II)]. The transition temperature of the two phases was around 65°C in the given ethanol–water binary (7:1) mixture. The characterization of monohydrate and anhydrate phases regarding structures and stabilities was carefully carried out using powder X-ray diffraction, single crystal X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, hot-stage microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The relationship between the molecular interactions of monohydrate and anhydrate phases under different packing architectures and their thermal behaviours was analysed and established. In addition, the relationships between the structures and thermal behaviours for the two solid forms were analysed and established. In addition, the effect of solvent on phase conversion, the relationships between the temperature and water activity, as well as the relative stability of monohydrate and anhydrate phases under different thermodynamic conditions, were investigated by solid–solid transformation and solvent-mediated transformation experiments. It was obvious that the transition temperature of monohydrate and anhydrate phases of PDA-TPA was significantly influenced by water activity, and the larger the value of water activity is, the higher is the transition temperature. These studies give insight into the transformation of nylon 5T monomer salt and contribute to the control of target crystal preparation.",

The space group is Cm , a = 5.5033 (3), b = 9.5289 (6), c = 7.3328 (5) Å, β = 104.493 (7)°, composition (Fe 2+ 2.461 Fe 3+ 0.539 )(Si 1.461 Fe 3+ 0.539 )O 5 (OH) 4 , Z = 2. Despite diffusely streaked characteristic polytype reflections, the refinement converged to R obs = 0.0242 for 1117 independent reflections. Separate R obs values of 0.0183 and 0.0553 were obtained for 415 subfamily and 702 characteristic reflections, respectively. The structure is built of one edge-sharing octahedral ( Oc ) and one corner-sharing tetrahedral ( Tet ) sheet forming the 1:1 layer by sharing apical corners of the Tet sheet. Consecutive layers are shifted by a /3 of the hexagonal cell, the polytype belongs to the subfamily (Bailey's group) A. There are two octahedral sites M 1 (at m ), M 2 (in a general position) both fully occupied by Fe. Since the M 2 octahedron is larger than M 1, the Oc sheet is meso-octahedral . The Tet sheet contains one tetrahedral position, T 1, occupied by Si and Fe in the ratio 0.731:0.269 (9). The ring of tetrahedra is strongly ditrigonalized, α = +12.7°; Franzini type A. Of three H atoms localized, two are involved in hydrogen bonds, linking OH groups of the Oc sheet with basal O atoms of the Tet sheet. The basal O atoms (acceptors) of the Tet sheet are rotated close to OH groups (donors) of the Oc sheet of an adjacent layer in order to achieve reasonable lengths and geometries of hydrogen bonds. The structure is interpreted as an example of the order–disorder (OD) structure of more than one kind of layer with a very low degree of desymmetrization.",

    "abstract": "The distortion theorem of the bond-valence theory predicts that the mean bond length 〈D〉 increases with increasing deviation of the individual bond lengths from their mean value according to the equation 〈D〉 = (D' + ΔD), where D' is the length found in a polyhedron having equivalent bonds and ΔD is the bond distortion. For a given atom, D' is expected to be similar from one structure to another, whereas 〈D〉 should vary as a function of ΔD. However, in several crystal structures 〈D〉 significantly varies without any relevant contribution from ΔD. In accordance with bond-valence theory, 〈D〉 variation is described here by a new equation: 〈D〉 = (DRU + ΔDtop + ΔDiso + ΔDaniso + ΔDelec), where DRU is a constant related to the type of cation and coordination environment, ΔDtop is the topological distortion related to the way the atoms are linked, ΔDiso is an isotropic effect of compression (or stretching) in the bonds produced by steric strain and represents the same increase (or decrease) in all the bond lengths in the coordination sphere, ΔDaniso is the distortion produced by compression and stretching of bonds in the same coordination sphere, ΔDelec is the distortion produced by electronic effects. If present, ΔDelec can be combined with ΔDaniso because they lead to the same kind of distortions in line with the distortion theorem. Each D-index, in the new equation, corresponds to an algebraic expression containing experimental and theoretical bond valences. On the basis of this study, the ΔD index defined in bond valence theory is a result of both the bond topology and the distortion theorem (ΔD = ΔDtop + ΔDaniso + ΔDelec), and D' is a result of the compression, or stretching, of bonds (D' = DRU + ΔDiso). The deficiencies present in the bond-valence theory in explaining mean bond-length variations can therefore be overcome, and the observed variations of 〈D〉 in crystal structures can be described by a self-consistent model.",

The —OH and —C=O groups of H2SQ, HSQ− and SQ2− are potent donors and acceptors, as indicated by their hydrogen-bond geometries in available crystal structures in the CSD, and by the attractive energies calculated for their dimers with acetone and methanol, which were used as model acceptors and donors. The two anions have sufficient examples in the CSD for their addition as new central groups in IsoStar. It is also shown that charge- and resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds involving H2SQ and HSQ− are similar in strength to those made by carboxylate COO− acceptors, while hydrogen bonds made by the dianion SQ2− are somewhat stronger. The study reinforces the value of squaric acid and its anions as cocrystal formers and their actual and potential importance as isosteric replacements for carboxylic acid and carboxylate functions.",

    "abstract": "One single photo-induced linkage NO isomer (PLI) is detected and characterized in the dinitrosyl pentacoordinated compound [RuBr(NO) 2 (PCyp 3 ) 2 ]BF 4 by a combination of photocrystallographic and IR analysis. In the ground state, the molecule adopts a trigonal–bipyramidal structure with the two NO ligands almost linear with angles Ru—N1—O1 = 168.92 (16), Ru—N2—O2 = 166.64 (16)°, and exactly equal distances of Ru—N = 1.7838 (17) and O—N = 1.158 (2) Å. After light irradiation of 405 nm at T = 10 K, the angle of Ru—N2—O2 changes to 114.2 (6)° by rotation of the O atom towards the Br ligand with increased distances of Ru—N2 = 1.992 (6) and N2—O2 = 1.184 (8) Å, forming a bent κ N bonded configuration. Using IR spectroscopy, the optimal wavelength and maximum population of 39 (1)% of the PLI is determined. In the ground state (GS), the two symmetric ν s (NO) and asymmetric ν as (NO) vibrations are measured at 1820 and 1778 cm −1 , respectively. Upon photo-irradiation, the detection of only one new vibrational ν(NO) stretching band at 1655 cm −1 , assigned to the antisymmetric coupled vibration mode and shifted to lower wavenumbers by −123 cm −1 , supports the photocrystallographic result. These experimental results are supported by additional DFT calculations, which reproduce the structural parameters and vibrational properties of both the ground state and the photo-induced linkage isomer well. Especially the experimentally characterized molecular structure of the PLI state corresponds to an energy minimum in the calculations; the stabilization of the bent κ N bonded configuration of the PLI state originates from specific intramolecular orbital overlap.",

Slabs perpendicular to the hexagonal axis comprise molecules Co(sepulchrate) alternating with nitrate groups A and B. Coordinated by six sepulchrate molecules, highly disordered nitrate groups C are accommodated between the slabs. Here we report the fully ordered, low-temperature crystal structure of Co(sep)(NO 3) 3. It is found to be a high-Z' structure with Z' = 12 of the 12-fold superstructure with monoclinic symmetry P2 1 (c unique). Correlations between structural parameters are effectively removed by refinements within the superspace approach. Superstructure formation is governed by a densification of the packing in conjunction with ordering of nitrate group C, the latter assuming different orientations for each of the Z' = 12 independent copies in the superstructure. The Co(sep) moiety exhibits small structural variations over its 12 independent copies, while orientations of nitrate groups A and B vary less than the orientations of the nitrate group C do. Molecular packing in the superstructure is found to be determined by short C-H...H-C contacts, with H...H distances of 2.2-2.3 Å, and by short C-H...O contacts, with H...O distances down to 2.2 Å. These contacts presumably represent weak C-H...O hydrogen bonds, but in any case they prevent further densification of the structure and strengthening of weak N-H...O hydrogen bonds with observed H...O distances of 2.4-2.6 Å.The 12-fold superstructure at T = 95 K is described as a commensurately modulated structure in superspace.

At a pressure of 2.55 GPa, distances between radical dimers shortened to 2.9 Å, which corresponds to distances observed in extended π-bonded polymers. Increasing pressure further to 6 GPa reduced the interplanar separation of the radicals to 2.75 Å. This may indicate that the covalent component of the interaction significantly increased, in accordance with the results of DFT calculations reported elsewhere [Molčanov et al. (2019), Cryst. Growth Des. 19, 391-402].",

    "abstract": "This work presents the crystal structure determination of two elusive polymorphs of furazidin, an antibacterial agent, employing a combination of crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations and an NMR crystallography approach. Two previously uncharacterized neat crystal forms, one of which has two symmetry-independent molecules (form I), whereas the other one is a Z' = 1 polymorph (form II), crystallize in P21/c and P1 space groups, respectively, and both are built by different conformers, displaying different intermolecular interactions. It is demonstrated that the usage of either CSP or NMR crystallography alone is insufficient to successfully elucidate the above-mentioned crystal structures, especially in the case of the Z' = 2 polymorph. In addition, cases of serendipitous agreement in terms of 1H or 13C NMR data obtained for the CSP-generated crystal structures different from the ones observed in the laboratory (false-positive matches) are analyzed and described. While for the majority of analyzed crystal structures the obtained agreement with the NMR experiment is indicative of some structural features in common with the experimental structure, the mentioned serendipity observed in exceptional cases points to the necessity of caution when using an NMR crystallography approach in crystal structure determination.",

    "abstract": "Neutron powder diffraction data have been collected from a series of flash-frozen aqueous solutions of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with concentrations between 25 and 66.7 mol% DMSO. These reveal the existence of three stoichiometric hydrates, which crystallize on warming between 175 and 195 K. DMSO trihydrate crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, with unit-cell parameters at 195 K of a = 10.26619 (3), b = 7.01113 (2), c = 10.06897 (3) Å, β = 101.5030 (2)° and V = 710.183 (3) Å3 (Z = 4). Two of the symmetry-inequivalent water molecules form a sheet of tiled four- and eight-sided rings; the DMSO molecules are sandwiched between these sheets and linked along the b axis by the third water molecule to generate water-DMSO-water tapes. Two different polymorphs of DMSO dihydrate have been identified. The α phase is monoclinic (space group P21/c), with unit-cell parameters at 175 K of a = 6.30304 (4), b = 9.05700 (5), c = 11.22013 (7) Å, β = 105.9691 (4)° and V = 615.802 (4) Å3 (Z = 4). Its structure contains water-DMSO-water chains, but these are polymerized in such a manner as to form sheets of reniform eight-sided rings, with the methyl groups extending on either side of the sheet. On warming above 198 K, α-DMSO·2H2O undergoes a solid-state transformation to a mixture of DMSO·3H2O + anhydrous DMSO, and there is then a stable eutectic between these two phases at ∼203 K. The β-phase of DMSO dihydrate has been observed in a rapidly frozen eutectic melt and in very DMSO-rich mixtures. It is observed to be unstable with respect to the α-phase; above ∼180 K, β-DMSO·2H2O converts irreversibly to α-DMSO·2H2O. At 175 K, the lattice parameters of β-DMSO·2H2O are a = 6.17448 (10), b = 11.61635 (16), c = 8.66530 (12) Å, β = 101.663 (1)° and V = 608.684 (10) Å3 (Z = 4), hence this polymorph is just 1.16% denser than the α-phase under identical conditions. Like the other two hydrates, the space group appears likely, on the basis of systematic absences, to be P21/c, but the structure has not yet been determined. Our results reconcile 60 years of contradictory interpretations of the phase relations in the binary DMSO-water system, particularly between mole fractions of 0.25-0.50, and confirm empirical and theoretical studies of the liquid structure around the eutectic composition (33.33 mol% DMSO).",

Both series of measurements showed a transition from the paraelectric to the ferroelectric state at nearly the same temperature, T c = 225 K. Temperature evolution of the unit-cell parameters and volume are drastically different for the synchrotron and laboratory data. The latter case corresponds to previous reports and shows an expected contraction of the cell on cooling. The data collected with the synchrotron beam show an abnormal nonlinear increase in volume on cooling. Structure analysis shows that this volume increase is accompanied by a suppression of scattering at high angles and an apparent increase of the anisotropic displacement parameters for all atoms; we therefore link these effects to radiation damage accumulated during consecutive data collections. The effects of radiation on the formation of the polar structure of ferroelectric glycinium phosphite is discussed together with the advantages and drawbacks of synchrotron experimentation with fine temperature sampling.",

The classification of perovskites has been unambiguous in the discussion of 3D and layered 2D perovskites due to the dimensional constraints. However, in 1D perovskites, the additional degrees of freedom have resulted in a large number of possible structural configurations. The new proposed notation aims to classify these structures based on the connectivity of the octahedra of the perovskite, which has a periodic repeating pattern. However, the notation should be restricted to simple 1D perovskites and haloplumbate structures as the notation would become too cumbersome when applied to an exotic framework which has 3D characteristics, such as perovskite polytypes.",

    "abstract": "The present work develops a novel unified approach to describe the crystal structure of orthorhombic martensite (α′′) in Ti alloys independent of chemical composition. By employing a straightforward yet highly instructive solid sphere model for the basic tetrahedral structural unit the crystal structures involved in the β ↔ α′′/α′ martensitic transformation are categorized into several intermediate configurations. Importantly, a new metric is introduced, δ, which unambiguously characterizes the atomic positions inside the orthorhombic unit cell depending on unit-cell geometry. Furthermore, the exclusive use of relative quantities to describe unit-cell geometry and atom positions renders the approach developed herein independent of alloy content. In this way, shortcomings of commonly suggested structural metrics for α′′ are eliminated. Subsequently, the novel methodology is applied to analyse and compare the crystal structure of α′′ across a broad range of Ti alloys based on experimentally measured unit-cell parameters. From this analysis it emerges that a large fraction of structural configurations along the b.c.c.– Cmcm –h.c.p. transformation path is not observed in quenched alloys. The threshold between the not-observed and the remaining well observed configurations is identified with an ideal Cmcm crystal structure, relative to which the experimentally found α′′ is compressed along its c axis.",

Chem. 46, 9760-9767], a simple tool for the identification and quantitative estimation of both steric and electronic factors causing deformations of the coordination sphere. The empirical bond-valence (BV) parameters in the exponential equation [Brown & Altermatt (1985). Acta Cryst.

The values of the resultant BVV were less than 0.10 v.u. for 95% of the set comprising 897 [CBO2] fragments. Analysis of the distribution of BVV components allowed for the description of subtle in- and out-of plane deviations from the `ideal' (sp(2)) geometry of boron coordination sphere. The distortions specific for distinct groups of compounds such as boronic acids, cyclic and acyclic esters, benzoxaboroles and hemiesters were revealed. In cyclic esters the direction of strains was found to be controlled by the ring size effect. It was shown that the syn or anti location of substituents on O atoms is decisive for the deformations direction for both acids and acyclic esters. The greatest strains were observed in the case of benzoxaboroles which showed the highest deviation from the zero value of the resultant BVV. The out-of-plane distortions, described by the vz component of the resultant BVV, were ascertained to be useful in the identification of weak secondary interactions on the fourth coordination site of the boron centre.",

Herein, the crystal growth behaviors of amorphous anti-inflammatory drug nimesulide (NIME) are systemically investigated in the glassy and supercooled liquid state as a function of temperature. A sudden over-tenfold increase is observed in the bulk crystal growth of NIME on cooling below its glass transition temperature (Tg). This fast growth behavior is known as a glass-to-crystal (GC) mode and has been reported in some molecular glasses. Fast surface crystal growth of NIME can persist up to Tg + 57°C with a weak jump in its growth rates at 30-40°C. In addition, surface crystal growth and GC growth of NIME exhibit an almost identical temperature dependence, supporting the view that GC growth is indeed a surface-facilitated process. Moreover, the bubble-induced fast crystal growth of NIME is observed in the interior of its supercooled liquid with approximately the same growth kinetics as surface crystal growth. These findings are relevant for a full understanding of the surface-related crystallization behaviors and physical stability of amorphous pharmaceutical formulations.",

The simplest approach provides a valuable qualitative preview, but MC and MD are becoming easily accessible to the general solid-state chemist thanks to the facilities of the newly developed Milano Chemistry Molecular Simulation (MiCMoS) platform. Their combined results offer a wealth of information on the behaviour of phenyl-methyl and phenyl-trifluoromethyl groups, almost invariably affected by rotational flipping, whose nature and consequences are discussed with respect to disorder modelling in the refinement of X-ray structures. Whole-body reorientation takes place in flat molecules, benzene being the well-known prototype, but also in a very large molecule like coronene.

Needle-like single-crystal samples up to 10 mm in length were obtained by physical vapor transport. The crystal structure was determined at 95 K and 293 K using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. With decreasing temperature, the space group P21/n does not change, but the unit-cell volume of the crystal decreases. The presence of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds was established. Melting parameters (Tm = 305.5°C, ΔHm = 52.2 kJ mol-1) and the presence of a liquid-crystalline mesophase (TLC = 336.3°C, ΔHLC = 1.4 kJ mol-1) were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and in situ thermal polarization optical microscopy studies. The presence of linear chains of hydrogen bonds ensures high stability of the crystal structure in a wide temperature range. The luminophore is characterized by a large Stokes shift (5120-5670 cm-1) and a high quantum yield of fluorescence, reaching 96% in solutions (λmax = 517 nm) and 27% in thin crystalline films (λmax = 529 nm). The calculated absorption and emission spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data. Because of the excellent optical properties and high thermal stability, the new linear luminophore has great potential for application in organic photonics and optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Neodymium iron borate NdFe3(BO3)4 is an intensively studied multiferroic with high electric polarization values controlled by a magnetic field. It is characterized by a large quadratic magnetoelectric effect, rigidity in the base plane and a rather strong piezoelectric effect. In this work, the atomic structure of (Nd0.91Bi0.09)Fe3(BO3)4 was studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction in the temperature range 20-500 K (space group R32, Z = 3). The Bi atoms found in the composition partially substitute the Nd atoms in the 3a position; they entered the structure due to the growth conditions in the presence of Bi2Mo3O12. It was shown that in the temperature range 20-500 K there is no structural phase transition R32→P3121, which occurs in rare-earth iron borates (RE = Eu-Er, Y) with an effective rare-earth cation radius smaller than that of Nd. The temperature dependence of the unit-cell c parameter reveals a slight increase on cooling below 90 K, which is similar to the results obtained previously for iron borates of Gd, Y and Ho. The atomic distances (Nd,Bi)-O, (Nd,Bi)-B, (Nd,Bi)-Fe, Fe-O, Fe-B and Fe-Fe in the iron chains and between chains decrease steadily with decreasing temperature from 500 to 90 K, whereas the B1(3b)-O distance does not change and the average B2(9e)-O distance increases slightly. There is a uniform decrease in the atomic displacement parameters with decreasing temperature, with a more pronounced decrease for the Nd(3a) and O2(9e) atoms. The O2(9e) atoms are characterized by the maximum atomic displacement parameters and the most elongated atomic displacement ellipsoids. The characteristic Debye and Einstein temperatures, and the static component in the atomic displacements were determined for cations using multi-temperature diffraction data. It was shown that the Nd cations have the weakest bonds with the surrounding atoms and the B cations have the strongest.",

    "abstract": "The crystal structure of samarium iron borate was analyzed with regard to growth conditions and temperature. The inclusion of about 7% Bi atoms in the crystals grown using the Bi2Mo3O12-based flux was discovered and there were no impurities in the crystals grown using the Li2WO4-based flux. No pronounced structural features associated with Bi inclusion were observed. The different absolute configurations of the samples grown using both fluxes were demonstrated. Below 80 K, a negative thermal expansion of the c unit-cell parameter was found. The structure of (Sm0.93Bi0.07)Fe3(BO3)4 belongs to the trigonal space group R32 in the temperature range 90-400 K. A decrease in the (Sm,Bi)-O, Sm-B, Sm-Fe, Fe-O, Fe-B and Fe-Fe distances is observed with a lowering of the temperature, B1-O does not change, B2-O increases slightly and the B2O3 triangles deviate from the ab plane. The strongest decrease in the equivalent isotropic atomic displacement parameters (Ueq) with decreasing temperature is observed for atoms Sm and O2, and the weakest is observed for B1. The O2 atoms have the highest Ueq values, the most elongated atomic displacement ellipsoids of all the atoms and the smallest number of allowed vibrational modes of all the O atoms. The largest number of allowed vibrational modes and the strongest interactions with neighbouring atoms is seen for the B atoms, and the opposite is seen for the Sm atoms. The quadrupole splitting Δ(T) of the paramagnetic Mössbauer spectra increases linearly with cooling. The Néel temperature [TN = 31.93 (5) K] was determined from the temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field Bhf(T), which has a non-Brillouin character. The easy-plane long-range magnetic ordering below TN was confirmed.",

    "abstract": "This work is devoted to an investigation of elemental composition, crystal structure and thermal expansion of natural oxoborate azoproite from the Tazheran massif (Siberia, Russia) in the temperature range 5–1650 K. Elemental composition was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Its empirical formula based on five oxygen atoms is (Mg 1.81 Fe 2+ 0.19 ) ∑2.00 (Fe 3+ 0.36 Ti 0.26 Mg 0.26 Al 0.12 ) ∑1.00 O 2 (BO 3 ). Local environment, oxidation states and ratio of Fe atoms are determined using Mössbauer spectroscopy and compared with EDX and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) data. A refinement of the crystal structure from SCXRD data collected at 293 K was provided for the first time. The structure could be described both in terms of cation- and anion-centered polyhedra. It is composed of vertex- and edge-sharing metal–oxygen [ M O 6 ] n − octahedra that form extended zigzag chains along the a axis building up a framework with the [BO 3 ] 3− triangles located in its distorted trigonal channels. From the other point of view, there are double chains consisting of oxocentred [O M 4 ] n + tetrahedra and [O M 5 ] n + tetragonal pyramids forming six-membered rings with the triangles in its cavities. Four non-equivalent M n + sites are occupied by cations as follows: M (1) (2 a ) and M (2) (2 d ) – Mg, M (3) (4 g ) – Mg and Fe 2+ , M (4) (4 h ) – Fe 3+ , Ti 4+ , Mg and Al 3+ . According to differential scanning calorimetry, low- and high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (LT- and HT-XRD) data, Mössbauer spectroscopy and magnetometry data (5 ≤ T ≤ 1650 K), there are no phase transitions obtained in the temperature range investigated. However, some anomalies in temperature dependencies of unit-cell parameters caused by a partial Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ oxidation are found in the range 873–1173 K. Azoproite melts at a temperature higher than 1600 K. Eigenvalues of the thermal expansion tensor are calculated for the oxoborate and thermal expansion is described in comparison with its crystal structure.",

Bonds in the TiO 5 polyhedron are discussed in comparison to analogous coordination polyhedra in other minerals and compounds. A review of all known compounds with Ti 4+ O 5 polyhedra shows that most of them are titanosilicates in which titanium forms a short Ti—O bond (∼1.61 to ∼1.77 Å). Poor Gladstone–Dale compatibility between chemical composition, optical characteristics and density of these compounds is explained by the anomalous contribution of [5] Ti 4+ to the optical properties as shown by calculations based on the relationship between electronic polarizabilities and refractive indices. An improved Gladstone–Dale coefficient of 0.29 is suggested for TiO 2 with [5] Ti 4+ .

X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence (PL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques are used to study the influence of thickness of AlN and GaN sublayers on strain distribution in GaN/AlN SL structures. Detailed X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate that the strain occurring in SLs generally decreases with an increase of well/barrier thickness. Fitting of X-ray diffraction curves allowed the real thicknesses of the GaN wells and AlN barriers to be determined. Since blurring of the interfaces causes deviation of calculated data from experimental results, the quality of the interfaces has been evaluated as well and compared with results of TEM measurements. For the samples with thinner wells/barriers, the presence of pinholes and threading dislocations has been observed in TEM measurements. The best quality of interfaces has been found for the sample with a well/barrier thickness of 3 nm. Finally, PL spectra show that due to the quantum-confined Stark effect the PL peak energies of the SLs decreased with increasing the width of the GaN quantum wells and AlN barriers. The effect is well modeled by ab initio calculations based on density functional theory applied for tetragonally strained structures of the same geometry using a full tensorial representation of the strain in the SLs.",

In part because crystal electric field effects are impoverished for an S-state ion, as with Gd3+ intermetallics, and Eu2+ substitution in biological and optically active materials is resourceful. The magnetic structure of EuPdSn2 is not wholly resolved. Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic structures coexist in powder neutron diffraction patterns, and compete in the ground state. Moreover, the specific heat as a function of temperature is enigmatic and indicative of J = 5/2. We present symmetry-informed analytic magnetic structure factors for single crystal resonant X-ray Bragg diffraction using Eu atomic resonances that reveal significant potential for the technique. Europium ions use Wyckoff positions that are not centres of inversion symmetry in magnetic space groups inferred from neutron diffraction. In consequence, axial and polar Eu multipoles are compulsory components of both magnetic neutron and resonant X-ray Bragg diffraction patterns. The proposed antiferromagnetic phase of EuPdSn2 supports anapoles (magnetic polar dipoles) already observed in magnetic neutron diffraction patterns presented by Gd-doped SmAl2, and several resonant X-ray diffraction patterns.",

The structure is described as a heteropolyhedral framework composed of edge- and vertex-sharing [ M O 6 ] n − ( M = Cu 2+ , Fe 3+ ) octahedra that form extended zigzag chains in the bc plane with isolated trigonal planar [BO 3 ] 3− located in triangular cavities of the cationic framework. Oxo-centered [O M 4 ] n + tetrahedra and [O M 5 ] n + tetragonal pyramids are observed and described for the first time. The structure is disordered: the Cu1 and Cu3 sites are fully occupied by the Cu 2+ ions, while the M 2 and M 4 sites are occupied by the Cu 2+ and Fe 3+ ions in ratios of 0.59:0.41 and 0.20:0.80, respectively. The O4 site is split into two sites, O4 A and O4 B , which leads to the formation of distorted [ M 2O 6 ] n − , Cu3O 6 ] n − and [ M 4O 6 ] n − polyhedra. Thermal behavior of Cu 2 FeO 2 (BO 3 ) was investigated using in situ high-temperature single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, simultaneous thermal analysis and high-temperature heat capacity measurements. Unusual behavior of the unit-cell parameters and specific heat is observed at ∼690 K. The borate is stable up to ∼1040 K, when an incomplete solid-phase decomposition begins with the formation of CuO and (Cu,Fe) 3 O 4 phases. The anisotropy of thermal expansion is weak and it is explained by (i) the preferable orientation of the most chemically rigid [BO 3 ] 3− units, (ii) the theory of shear deformations of the monoclinic ac plane and (iii) an arrangement of the oxo-centered [O 2 M 7 ] n + and [O 2 M 8 ] n + double chains. Volume expansion increases with an increase in temperature from 24.6 × 10 −6 K −1 (at 300 K) to 35.4 × 10 −6 K −1 (at 1000 K). The degree of anisotropy of the expansion of Cu 2 FeO 2 (BO 3 ) is similar to that of orthorhombic ludwigite-type oxoborates.",

    "abstract": "In recent years powder X-ray diffraction has proven to be a valuable alternative to single-crystal X-ray diffraction for determining electron-density distributions in high-symmetry inorganic materials, including subtle deformation in the core electron density. This was made possible by performing diffraction measurements in vacuum using high-energy X-rays at a synchrotron-radiation facility. Here we present a new version of our custom-built in-vacuum powder diffractometer with the sample-to-detector distance increased by a factor of four. In practice this is found to give a reduction in instrumental peak broadening by approximately a factor of three and a large improvement in signal-to-background ratio compared to the previous instrument. Structure factors of silicon at room temperature are extracted using a combined multipole-Rietveld procedure and compared with ab initio calculations and the results from the previous diffractometer. Despite some remaining issues regarding peak asymmetry, the new diffractometer yields structure factors of comparable accuracy to the previous diffractometer at low angles and improved accuracy at high angles. The high quality of the structure factors is further assessed by modelling of core electron deformation with results in good agreement with previous investigations.The present state of X-ray electron-density determination from powder-diffraction data is briefly reviewed together with the first results from a new large-diameter in-vacuum diffractometer.",

The atoms-in-molecules integrated experimental charges for Ca 2+ and F − ions are +1.40 e and −0.70 e, respectively. The derived electron-density distribution, maximum electron-density paths, interaction lines and bond critical points along Ca 2+ ...F − and F − ...F − contacts revealed the character of these interactions. The Ca 2+ ...F − interaction is clearly a closed shell and ionic in character. However, the F − ...F − interaction has properties associated with the recently recognized type of interaction referred to as `charge-shift' bonding. This conclusion is supported by the topology of the electron localization function and analysis of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals topological parameters. The Ca 2+ ...F − bonded radii – measured as distances from the centre of the ion to the critical point – are 1.21 Å for the Ca 2+ cation and 1.15 Å for the F − anion. These values are in a good agreement with the corresponding Shannon ionic radii. The F − ...F − bond path and bond critical point is also found in the CaF 2 crystal structure. According to the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals, this interaction is attractive in character. This is additionally supported by the topology of non-covalent interactions based on the reduced density gradient.",

    "abstract": "The spinel oxide AlV 2 O 4 is a unique material, in which the formation of clusters is accompanied by atomic, charge and orbital ordering and a rhombohedral lattice distortion. In this work a theory of the structural phase transition in AlV 2 O 4 is proposed. This theory is based on the study of the order-parameter symmetry, thermodynamics, electron density distribution, crystal chemistry and mechanisms of formation of the atomic and orbital structures of the rhombohedral phase. It is established that the critical order parameter is transformed according to irreducible representation k 9 (τ 4 ) (in Kovalev notation) of the Fd \\bar{3}m space group. Knowledge of the order-parameter symmetry allows us to show that the derived AlV 2 O 4 rhombohedral structure is a result of displacements of all atom types and the ordering of Al atoms (1:1 order type in tetrahedral spinel sites), V atoms (1:1:6 order type in octahedral sites) and O atoms (1:1:3:3 order type), and the ordering of d xy , d xz and d yz orbitals. Application of the density functional theory showed that V atoms in the Kagomé sublattice formed separate trimers. Also, no sign of metallic bonding between separate vanadium trimers in the heptamer structure was found. The density functional theory study and the crystal chemical analysis of V—O bond lengths allowed us to assume the existence of dimers and trimers as main clusters in the structure of the AlV 2 O 4 rhombohedral modification. The trimer model of the low-symmetry AlV 2 O 4 structure is proposed. Within the Landau theory of phase transitions, typical diagrams of possible phase states are built. It is shown that phase states can be changed as a first-order phase transition close to the second order in the vicinity of tricritical points of the phase diagrams.",

    "abstract": "Structural evolution of a La 2 Ti 2 O 7 ferroelectric compound possessing perovskite-type slabs at elevated temperatures was investigated using the single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique. The monoclinic low-temperature phase (L) transformed into the orthorhombic high-temperature phase (H) via an incommensurately modulated phase (IC) between ∼989 and ∼1080 K. The L–IC transition was considered to be of the first order, with the L+IC two-phase co-existing region between ∼989 and ∼1027 K. The structure of IC was determined from the (3+1)-dimensional superspace representation with a modulation vector q = α a o (α ≃ 0.49), where a o is the a -axis vector of the basic cell. The structural modulation originated from the variation of the tilt angle of the TiO 6 octahedra in the perovskite-type slab in association with small positional displacements of La atoms. The IC–H transition took place at ∼1080 K and was close to the second order. During the IC–H transition, nanoscale flat plate domains having either a cell twin of the L-type structural modules or a cell twin of the alternating H- and L-type structural modules began to appear in the approximant structure of IC. The thickness of the flat plate domains then grew rapidly along the modulation vector in proportion to (½ − α) −1 as α approached ½ with decreasing temperature. In the two-phase L+IC co-existing region, the IC phase consisting of the two types of cell twins was gradually replaced with the low-temperature monoclinic phase L, which is not cell twinned but rather twinned macroscopically by the L-type structural modules.",

The Bi atoms enter the composition from Bi 2 Mo 3 O 12 -based flux during crystal growth and significantly affect T str . The content of Bi was estimated by two independent methods, establishing the composition as (Ho 0.96 Bi 0.04 )Fe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 . In the low-temperature (LT) phase below T str the (Ho 0.96 Bi 0.04 )Fe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 crystal symmetry is trigonal, of space group P 3 1 21, whereas at high temperature (HT) above 365 K the symmetry increases to space group R 32. There is a sharp jump of oxygen O1 (LT) and O2 (LT) atomic displacement parameters (ADP) at T str . O1 and O2 ADP ellipsoids are the most elongated over 90–500 K. In space group R 32 specific distances decrease steadily or do not change with decreasing temperature. In space group P 3 1 21 the distortion of the polyhedra Ho(Bi)O 6 , Fe1O 6 and Fe2O 6 , B2O 3 and B3O 3 increases with decreasing temperature, whereas the triangles B1O 3 remain almost equilateral. All BO 3 triangles deviate from the ab plane with decreasing temperature. Fe–Fe distances in Fe1 chains decrease, while distances in Fe2 chains increase with decreasing temperature. The Mössbauer study confirms that the FeO 6 octahedra undergo complex dynamic distortions. However, all observed distortions are rather small, and the general change in symmetry during the structural phase transition has very little influence on the local environment of iron in oxygen octahedra. The Mössbauer spectra do not distinguish two structurally different Fe1 and Fe2 positions in the LT phase.

Each dynamic model density is used as prior in the calculation of electron density according to the maximum entropy method (MEM). We show that at the bond-critical points (BCPs) of covalent C-C and C-N bonds the IAM-HO and INV priors produce reliable MEM density maps, including reliable values for the density and its Laplacian. The agreement between these MEM density maps and dynamic MP density maps is less good for polar C-O bonds, which is explained by the large spread of values of topological descriptors of C-O bonds in static MP densities. The density and Laplacian at BCPs of hydrogen bonds have similar values in MEM density maps obtained with all four kinds of prior densities. This feature is related to the smaller spatial variation of the densities in these regions, as expressed by small magnitudes of the Laplacians and the densities. It is concluded that the use of the IAM-HO prior instead of the IAM prior leads to improved MEM density maps. This observation shows interesting parallels to MP refinements, where the use of the IAM-HO as an initial model is the accepted procedure for solving MP parameters. A deconvolution of thermal motion and static density that is better than the deconvolution of the IAM appears to be necessary in order to arrive at the best MP models as well as at the best MEM densities.",

    "abstract": "VF3-type FeF3 is generally considered as a perovskite with a completely vacant A site. The high-pressure structural evolution of FeF3 has been studied by both X-ray diffraction and theoretical simulation up to 62.0 GPa. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that VF3-type FeF3 is stable up to 50 GPa. The structural evolution presents three features at different pressure ranges. At P < 10 GPa, the volume reduction is dominated by the FeF6 octahedral rotation, and a small octahedral strain develops upon compression, which represents an elongation of FeF6 octahedra along the c axis. Between 10 and 25 GPa, the volume reduction is mainly attributed to the Fe-F bond length decreasing, and the octahedral strain gradually disappears. Between 25 and 50 GPa, an octahedral elongation along the a axis quickly develops, resulting in a substantial structural distortion. Structural instability is predicted at P > 51 GPa on the basis of a soft mode occurring in phonon calculations.

    "abstract": "Calcinaksite, KNa[Ca(H 2 O)][Si 4 O l0 ], a new natural member of the litidionite group, was found in a calcic xenolith from alkaline basalt of the Bellerberg volcano, Eastern Eifel region, Rhineland–Palatinate, Germany. The crystal structure has been studied based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Triclinic unit-cell parameters are: a = 7.021 (2), b = 8.250 (3), c = 10.145 (2) Å, α = 102.23 (2), β = 100.34 (2), γ = 115.09 (3)°, space group P \\bar 1. The structure model was determined by the `charge-flipping' method and refined to R = 0.0527 in anisotropic approximation using 3057 I &gt; 3σ( I ). Calcinaksite is a hydrous calcium-dominant litidionite-group mineral. The crystal structure of calcinaksite (like other litidionite-group minerals and related compounds) is based on a heteropolyhedral framework and is characterized by the presence of several types of channels. Calcium forms distorted CaO 5 Ø (Ø = H 2 O) octahedra while Na forms NaO 5 square pyramids. Nine-coordinated K atoms are located in a channel extending along [010]. Water molecules occupy a channel running along the [100] direction and are characterized by a rather high equivalent isotropic displacement parameter of 0.053 (2) Å 2 . In calcinaksite, there are three short distances between the water molecule and oxygen atoms, O w ...O3 [2.844 (5) Å], O w ...O9 [2.736 (4) Å] and O w ...O w [2.843 (7) Å]. These distances correspond to three hydrogen bonds detected by IR data (the bands at 3340, 3170 and 3540 cm −1 ).",

By analysing the degree of growth of the morphologically important crystal faces, a ranking of the most relevant non-covalent interactions determining the crystal structure can be inferred. The morphological information is considered with an approach opposite to the conventional one: instead of searching inside the structure for the potential key interactions and using them to calculate the crystal habit, the observed crystal morphology is used to define the preferential lines of growth of the crystal, and then this information is interpreted by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Comparison with the X-ray structure confirms the validity of the strategy, thus suggesting this top-down approach to be a useful tool for crystal engineering.",

Their structures are based on two-dimensional chiral or achiral units with the composition [(UO 2 ) 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 (H 2 O)] 2− and two types of topologies ( A or/and B ). The structural architecture of (4) is unique amongst all known uranyl-based structures, and unusual among hybrid organic/inorganic structures in general as it contains layers of identical composition, but of different topology. The unique structural configurations and non-centrosymmetry in (1) and (4) is governed by selective formation of hydrogen bonding rather than by the formation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic zones in the organic interlayer. It is shown that chiral architectures in uranyl systems may form from achiral building units as observed in (3) and (4). This is somewhat analogous to certain organic compounds, where achiral molecules are also able to form chiral layers. Within the concept of such an interpretation the structure of (3) can then be described as a racemate consisting of two A and A ′ chiral layers. In a similar approach the structure of (4) can be interpreted as being formed by four chiral layers. Layer pairs AA ′ and BB ′ can then be considered as racemic pairs and the whole structure is a co-racemate built by a combination of two racemates. Two-stage formation can be suggested for (4).",

The presence of F atoms on the aromatic core of the azobenzene increases the lifetime of the metastable cis -isomer, allowing single crystals of the cis -azobenzene to be grown. Structural analysis on the cis -azobenzene, complemented with density functional theory calculations, highlights the active role of the halogen-bond contact (N...I synthon) in promoting the stabilization of the cis -isomer. The presence of a long aliphatic chain on the azobenzene unit induces a phase segregation that stabilizes the molecular arrangement for both the trans - and cis -isomers. Due to the rarity of cis -azobenzene crystal structures in the literature, our paper makes a step towards understanding the role of non-covalent interactions in driving the packing of metastable azobenzene isomers. This is expected to be important in the future rational design of solid-state, photoresponsive materials based on halogen bonding.",

    "abstract": "The subsolidus phase relations of plagioclase feldspar solid solution have been puzzling mineralogists and petrologists for decades, mainly due to the complicated structures of intermediate plagioclase at low temperature. The crystal structures of 12 Na-rich plagioclase samples are investigated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. The samples studied cover a compositional range from An 21 to An 49 (An is anorthite, CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 ), as well as a wide variety of origins, from extremely slow-cooled gabbroic rocks to pegmatite and metamorphic rocks. The structures fall into three different types: C {\\bar 1}, e 2 and e 1, with an obviously increasing trend in the ordering states of the structures. The phase transitions from C{\\bar 1} to e 2 and e 2 to e 1 are both continuous in nature, as no abrupt structure change is required for the transformation. However, the structural difference between C \\bar 1 and e 1 is large enough to create a miscibility gap causing the Bøggild intergrowth. As the plagioclase structure becomes more and more ordered, Al–Si reorganization in the framework would occur before the ordering of Ca and Na in M sites. Dramatic variations of Na occupancy would only appear in e 1 structure with density modulation. This result confirms that Al–Si ordering is the major driving force of the formation of e -plagioclase structure. The composition of the lower end of the Bøggild intergrowth is precisely constrained to An 44 –An 45 , based on the structural differences between two samples from the same pegmatite crystal. The modulation periods and directions of e -plagioclase are dependent on the conditions at which e -ordering starts to happen, other than the composition of the plagioclase. However, the three components (δ h , δ k and δ l ) of the q vector show strong linear correlations among one another, indicating some crystallographic constraint on the modulation direction which might be independent from the composition. The detailed subsolidus phase relations among e 1, e 2 and C{\\bar 1} are illustrated with a local phase diagram, and schematic free energy curves at different temperatures are provided.",

However, the design of ideal candidates for these cocrystals remains difficult. This work compares the crystal energies of the CL-20-dinitrobenzene (DNB) and CL-20-2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) cocrystals with those of the respective pure coformers. The results indicate that the cocrystal formation is driven by the differences in the energies of the cocrystals and the coformers. Furthermore, analysis via Hirshfeld surfaces and two-dimensional fingerprint plots confirms that the O...O, O...H, O...N and C...O interactions were the main force for stabilizing the CL-20-based cocrystal structure. Based on these findings, a novel energetic-energetic cocrystal of CL-20-2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) was designed and prepared by means of a rapid method for solvent removal. The crystal structure was investigated via powder X-ray diffraction methods, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results revealed that the O-H...O hydrogen bonding interaction between the phenolic hydroxyl group of TNP and nitro groups of CL-20, as well as nitro...π, nitro...nitro and ONO2...π(N)NO2 interactions, based on the benzene ring and nitro groups, are the main interactions occurring in the cocrystal.",

Ketones (4) were successfully used as substrates for the preparation of the respective N -(2-hydroxyethyl)imidazoles (5) with yields up to 87%. The synthesized compounds were characterized by NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses, and several structures were confirmed and studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The analysis of the whole-of-molecule interactions shows that, despite the difference in the atom–atom contacts forming the crystals, dispersion energies make the largest contribution to the formation of the solids, giving an isotropic tendency in the topology of the energy framework diagrams for pairs of molecules. In addition, the in vitro antifungal activity of both families of compounds [ketones (4) and alcohols (5)] against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans was evaluated, where the 2,4-dichlorophenyl-substituted alcohol (5 f ), an isomer of the drug miconazole, showed the highest activity (IC 50 = 7.8 µg ml −1 against C. neoformans ).",

    "abstract": "Crystal growth is a classical discipline lying at the interfaces of Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science and Medicine.The research field has enjoyed an increasing number of young investigators over the past couple of decades, largely due to the burgeoning fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology which aim to fabricate nano-devices and/or to deliver nano-medicines in a process that mimics the exquisite wisdom of biologically controlled crystals.The interdisciplinary nature of these fields has posed a request for introductory monographs on the fundamental concepts of crystallization that are suitable for the diverse scientific backgrounds of young researchers.Among many of the introductory crystal growth books, the Crystal Growth for Beginners (3rd edition) by Ivan Markov is an excellent one that can serve the purpose and is worth reading.The book is well organized and is pedagogical.By discussing crystallization in pure systems, the author introduces and describes the important concepts, physical parameters and theoretical models pertaining to nucleation and growth of crystals.The book contains five chapters over 600 pages.The chapters are 1.Crystal-Ambient Phase Equilibrium, 2. Nucleation, 3. Crystal Growth, 4. Epitaxial Growth and 5.The Shoulder on Which we Stand.The current edition builds on the author's previous edition of the book with the exact same book title (Markov, 2003).The first four chapters are similar with the current version including some minor additions of topics and figures.Chapter 5 is completely new.In the first chapter, the concept of crystal formation from phase equilibrium is introduced and the importance of chemical potential in crystallization is addressed.Through the microscopic view of one-component systems, the fundamental concepts, kinetics and thermodynamics of kinks, steps, flat surfaces, rough surfaces and equilibrium crystal shapes are discussed.In addition, the derivation of the impactful pure thermodynamic Thomson-Gibbs equation (p.12) by Stranski and Kaischew utilizing a kinetic approach is elegantly presented (p.45).The thermodynamics and kinetics of nucleation via a classical pathway are addressed in the second chapter.The organization of the chapter is excellent, which makes it easy for beginners to grasp the important underlying physics involved in nucleation.For thermodynamics, homogenous and heterogenous nucleation of three-dimensional (3D) nuclei are discussed, followed by the presentation of nucleation of two-dimensional (2D) nuclei on a foreign substrate.For kinetics, the rate of nucleation is fully described.In this section, the author started the topic by first showing the general expression of the steady state rate of nucleation through a well-designed derivation with the assumptions of the model clearly delineated (pp.105-107).Based on this expression, the rates of nucleation from homogeneous, heterogeneous, 3D and 2D in solutions and melts are developed.Furthermore, the atomistic theory of heterogeneous nucleation (pp.129-143) is also described in detail.Readers with an interest in thin film deposition may find this section useful.This chapter is closed with a description of Ostwald's step rule.The third chapter is devoted to the concept of crystal growth.In the first half of the chapter, important physical parameters involved in crystal growth, such as growth rate, kinetic coefficient, critical length and their relationships to supersaturation are presented.They are described and discussed in great deal through the growth from different sources,",

Most of the identified compounds (77 cases) have been found to have two polymorphs, 14 compounds have three forms and there are only three examples of systems with four polymorphs. The analysis of density distribution within the database has revealed that only 62 out of 114 metastable polymorphs (referred to as group I) obey the `density rule' proposed by Burger and Ramberger [(1979), Mikrochim. Acta , 72 , 259–271], while the remaining 45% of the monotropic systems (group II) violate the rule. A number of physicochemical, structural and molecular descriptors have been used to find and highlight the differences between group I and group II of the polymorphs. Group II is characterized (on average) by higher values of descriptors, which are responsible for conformational flexibility of molecules. An algorithm has been proposed for carrying out bivariate statistical analysis. It implies partitioning the database into structurally related clusters based on Tanimoto similarity coefficients and subsequent analysis of each cluster in terms of the number of hydrogen bonds per molecule.",

The structures of the borates are described in terms of cation-centered and oxocentred polyhedra. There are different sequences of double chains and layers consisting of oxocentred [OM4]n+ tetrahedra and [OM5]n+ tetragonal pyramids forming a framework. Elemental composition was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Oxidation states and coordination sites of iron and tin in the oxoborates are determined using Mössbauer spectroscopy and compared with EDX and X-ray diffraction data (XRD). According to results obtained from high-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy, the Fe2+ to Fe3+ oxidation in vonsenite and hulsite occurs at approximately 500 and 600 K, respectively. According to the high-temperature XRD data, this process is accompanied by an assumed deformation of crystal structures and subsequent solid-phase decomposition to hematite and warwickite. It is seen as a monotonic decrease of volume thermal expansion coefficients with an increase in temperature. A partial magnetic ordering in hulsite is observed for the first time with Tc ≃ 383 K. Near this temperature, an unusual change of thermal expansion coefficients is revealed. Vonsenite starts to melt at 1571 K and hulsite melts at 1504 K. Eigenvalues of thermal expansion tensor are calculated for the oxoborates as well as anisotropy of the expansion is described in comparison with their crystal structures.",

LLZTO retains its cubic symmetry (space group Ia 3 d ) over the complete temperature range. When compared to other sites, the octahedral sites behave as the most rigid unit and show the smallest increase in atomic displacement parameters and bond length. The La and Li sites show similar thermal expansion in their bond lengths with temperature, and the anisotropic and equivalent atomic displacement parameters exhibit a distinctly larger increase at temperatures above 400 K. Detailed inspection of nuclear densities at the Li1 site reveal a small but significant displacement from the 24 d position to the typical 96 h position, which cannot, however, be resolved from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. The site occupation of Li I ions on Li1 and Li2 sites remains constant, so there is no change in site occupation with temperature.",

    "abstract": "The X-ray restrained wavefunction (XRW) method is a quantum crystallographic technique that allows the calculation of molecular wavefunctions adapted to minimize the difference between computed and reference structure factor amplitudes. The latter result from experimental measurements on crystals or from advanced theoretical calculations with periodic boundary conditions, and are used as external restraints in a traditional least-squares structural refinement. Detailed investigations have shown that the technique is able to reliably capture the effects of the crystal field on the molecular electron density. In a recent application, electron distributions obtained from preliminary X-ray restrained wavefunction calculations have been employed in the framework of frozen density embedding theory to embed excited state computations of well defined subsystems. Inspired by these results, it was decided to test, for the first time, the X-ray restrained extremely localized molecular orbitals (XR-ELMOs) along with the recently developed quantum mechanics/extremely localized molecular orbital multiscale embedding approach. By exploiting XR-ELMOs obtained through XRW calculations that used structure factor amplitudes resulting from periodic ab initio computations, excited state calculations of acrylamide in an environment mimicking the one of the crystal structure were performed. In all these computations, the QM region coincides with the crystal asymmetric unit and the ELMO subsystem consisted of two other acrylamide molecules involved in direct hydrogen bonds with the reference unit. The shifts of the excitation energies with respect to the corresponding gas-phase values were evaluated as a function of different parameters on which the computations with XR-ELMOs depend. For instance, the dependence on the resolution of the sets of structure factors that were used to determine the embedding XR-ELMOs were assessed in particular. The results have shown that the use of XR-ELMOs slightly (but not negligibly) improves the description of excited states compared to the gas-phase ELMOs. Once again, these results demonstrate the efficiency of the XRW approach in incorporating environment effects into the calculated molecular orbitals and, hence, into the corresponding electron densities.",

Novel phase transitions and predicted structures are presented, and apart from several interesting metastable structures, a very interesting pressure-induced phase transition is found in the TiOS compound. Furthermore, electronic properties were studied through the dependence of semiconducting properties on dopant concentration.

The magnetic properties were studied by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) (5 ≤ T ≤ 400 K) and are reported for the first time for iron-rich hulsite. Both oxoborates show a very complex magnetic behaviour. Cascades of magnetic transitions are revealed and the critical temperatures were determined. The sequences of magnetic transitions in both vonsenite and hulsite with increasing temperature were found to be as follows: magnetically ordered state → partial magnetic ordering → paramagnetic state. According to X-ray diffraction data (93 ≤ T ≤ 500 K), these processes are accompanied by anomalies in the unit-cell parameters and thermal expansion of the oxoborates at critical temperatures. A strong negative volume thermal expansion is observed for both oxoborates at temperatures below ∼120 K.",

It was found that this ligand crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, with Z' = 1. Further studies showed that - as a result of the one-pot metal-promoted reactions - three different polymorphic forms of H2L were obtained, with different numbers (1, 3 or 4) of symmetry-independent molecules depending on the lanthanide metal ion present in the reaction media: La (Z' = 3), Nd (Z' = 4), Sm, Tb, Ho and Yb (all Z' = 1); the last form is identical with that obtained by crystallization of the ligand itself. The geometrical features of all eight independent molecules of H2L are very similar. The relatively strong intramolecular O-H...N hydrogen bonds stabilize almost co-planar conformations of terminal rings and C-C=N-C linkers, at the same time strong hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors involved in these interactions cannot take part in the determination of supramolecular architecture. Therefore, weak intermolecular interactions are important and this can be regarded as one of the reasons for packing conflicts that lead to the presence of polymorphic forms and multiple molecules. The pseudosymmetries are observed in both forms with Z' > 1 and the degree of pseudosymmetry is described by the values of appropriate combinations of the coordinates. In order to elucidate the differences in crystal structures the Hirshfeld surface method was applied. It shows that there are only small differences in the surface shape and in the fingerprint plots; however, the volumes of voids in three structures are significantly different.",

A new type of twofold occupation domain is located on certain edge centers of the five-dimensional unit cell. The structure can be described in terms of a two-cluster model based on a decagonal cluster (∼ 23 Å diameter) arranged on the vertices of a pentagon-Penrose tiling (PPT) and a star-like cluster covering the remaining space. This model is used for the five-dimensional refinements, which converged to an R value of 0.126. The arrangement of clusters is significantly disordered as indicated by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). In order to check the structure and stability at higher temperatures, in-situ high-temperature (HT) single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted at 598 and 648 K (i.e. slightly below the decomposition temperature). The structure does not change significantly, however, the best quasiperiodic order is found at 598 K. The implication of these results on the stabilization mechanism of quasicrystals is discussed.",

This feature can be employed for retrieving compounds highly soluble in water from their aqueous solutions. The crystal structure is strongly stabilized by CH...O contacts. The crystal compression and thermal expansion as well as three shortest H...O distances comply with the inverse-relationship rule of pressure and temperature changes.",

The cooperative high-spin ↔ low-spin transition, centred at ca 180 K at ambient pressure, is shifted to higher temperatures as pressure is applied, showing a moderate sensitivity of the compound to pressure, since the spin transition is displaced by ca 140 K GPa(-1). The space-group symmetry (orthorhombic Pccn) remains unchanged over the pressure-temperature (P-T) range studied. The main structural consequence of the high-spin to low-spin transition is the contraction of the distorted octahedral [FeN6] chromophores, being more marked in the axial positions (occupied by the pmd units), than in the equatorial positions (occupied by four [Ag(CN)2](-) bridging ligands).",

The triclinic polymorphic form obtained due to slow evaporation of the same solution is formed due to only strong intermolecular interactions, N-H...O hydrogen bonds of two types, and stacking interactions of two types. Analysis of pairwise interaction energies showed that the monoclinic structure is columnar while the triclinic one is layered.

Their optical properties depend strongly on strain, being essential to the knowledge of the stress level to optimize the growth process. Here the structural and microstructural characteristics of sub-micron a -ZnO epilayers (12 to 770 nm) grown on r -sapphire by metal–organic chemical vapour deposition are studied. Morphological and structural studies have been made using scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution X-ray diffraction. Plastic unit-cell distortion and corresponding strain have been determined as a function of film thickness. A critical thickness has been observed as separating the non-elastic/elastic states with an experimental value of 150–200 nm. This behaviour has been confirmed from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements. An equation that gives the balance of strains is proposed as an interesting method to experimentally determine this critical thickness. It is concluded that in the thinnest films an elongation of the Zn—O bond takes place and that the plastic strained ZnO films relax through nucleation of misfit dislocations, which is a consequence of three-dimensional surface morphology.",

The compound crystallizes in trigonal space group R 3 and no phase transition was observed in the indicated pressure range. The low value of pressure bulk modulus [9.1 (5) GPa] found in this crystal is a characteristic of soft materials with predominant dispersive and electrostatic interaction forces. The nonlinear relationship between unit-cell parameters under high pressure is attributed to the influence of reduced intermolecular H...Cl contacts under pressure over 0.73 GPa. It also explains the high compression efficiency of [Rb(18-crown-6)][SbCl 6 ] crystals at relatively low pressures, resulting in a significant shift of the Rb atom to the center of the crown ether cavity. At pressures above 0.9 GPa, steric repulsion forces begin to play a remarkable role, since an increasing number of interatomic H...Cl and H...H contacts become shorter than the sum of their van der Waals (vdW) radii. Below 0.9 GPa, both unit-cell parameter dependences ( P – a and P – c ) exhibit hysteresis upon pressure release, demonstrating their influence on the disordered model of Rb atoms. The void reduction under pressure also demonstrates two linear sections with the inflection point at 0.9 GPa. Compression of the crystal is accompanied by a significant decrease in the volume of the voids, leading to the rapid approach of Rb atoms to the center of the crown ether cavity. For the Rb atom to penetrate into the center of the crown ether cavity in [Rb(18-crown-6)][SbCl 6 ], it is necessary to apply a pressure of about 2.5 GPa to disrupt the balance of atomic forces in the crystal. This sample serves as a compression model demonstrating the influence of both attractive and repulsive forces on the change in unit-cell parameters under pressure.",

The comparative solid state structural analysis of a new hydrate and 11 solvates of LAM has been undertaken in order to establish robustness of the supramolecular synthons 1 and 2 found in the crystal structure of LAM itself as well as LAM susceptibility to build methodical solid state supramolecular architecture in the given competitive surrounding of potential hydrogen bonds.

This random mixing of cations among polyhedral building blocks means that there are no channels for Na-ion conduction, rendering it electrochemically inactive.

The primitive unit cell is triclinic, P\\bar 1, Z = 4, cell parameters are a = 8.1416 (3), b = 10.6968 (3), c = 5.7835 (2) Å, α = 102.758 (3), β = 110.657 (3), γ = 101.020 (3)°, Robs = 0.0243 (Pz21), and a = 8.1372 (2), b = 10.6969 (2), c = 5.7840 (1) Å, α = 102.787 (2), β = 110.606 (2), γ = 100.983 (2)°, Robs = 0.0321 (Pz24). The structure can also be described in the non-standard pseudo-monoclinic octuple (Z = 32), F-centered (Kupčík) cell with extra points in {1\\over 4},{1\\over 4},0; {1\\over 4},{3\\over 4},{1\\over 2}; {3\\over 4},{1\\over 4},{1\\over 2}; {3\\over 4},{3\\over 4},0, with parameters a = 21.6466 (9), b = 8.1416 (3), c = 20.3824 (9) Å, α = 90.079 (4), β = 101.985 (5), γ = 89.948 (4)° (Pz21), and a = 21.6558 (5), b = 8.1372 (2), c = 20.3859 (8) Å, α = 90.028 (3), β = 101.994 (3), γ = 89.986 (2)° (Pz24). The structure is built of layers parallel to the bc plane, stacked along the a vector of the octuple cell, composed of ribbons parallel to the b vector: (i) ribbon of two strips of SbO5 flattened quadrangular pyramids, sharing apical edges; (ii) ribbon of edge-sharing corrugated lozenges SbO3S. Basal S atoms of pyramids share corners of lozenges. Sb atoms are displaced out of coordination polyhedra into the inter-layer space. The OD layer comprises adjacent halves of the structure building layers. The layer group is A(1)2/m1, the protocell is defined by b, c, (a/4)sin β. The MDO1 (4A) polytype is generated by repetition of the {\\bf t}_{(1,\\, {1\\over 4},\\,0)} [or alternatively {\\bf t}_{(1,\\,-{1\\over 4}, \\, 0)}] translation. The co-existence of two kinds of domains give rise to the twinning. The twin operation is 2[010], twin index 2. The total continuation of [. a2 .] generates the MDO2 (2M) polytype, space group A12/a1. Simulated and real diffraction patterns are presented. The important values (edges, angles) and displacements of atoms due to the desymmetrization were evaluated. The comparison with structures of stibnite, bismuthinite and aikinite is added.",

The new salt is characterized by means of thermal, spectroscopic, microscopic and powder diffraction measurements. The crystal structures of the salt and, for the first time, of pure domperidone have been determined by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In both structures, the piperidine ring of domperidone adopts the expected chair conformation, and supramolecular centrosymmetric R2(2)(8) motifs are formed by N-H...O hydrogen bonds between chlorine-substituted oxobenzimidazolyl groups. Further N-H...O hydrogen bonds occur between non-substituted oxobenzimidazolyl groups and the resulting C(4) motifs originates hydrogen-bonded chains, extending along the crystallographic b axis. In the salt, a single N-H...O hydrogen bond forms between the protonated nitrogen of the piperidine ring and the carboxylic O atom of the succinate ion. Two alternative and mutually exclusive positions for the nonsubstituted oxobenzimidazolyl group have also been observed; this disorder makes the hydrogen-bonded chains originating from the bicyclic group polar. The dissolution behaviour of the salt in dosage form is compared with two reference commercial products. The salt shows an increased solubility, a characteristic that could be of great advantage from a pharmaceutical view point.",

    "abstract": "The cooperative roles of various structural motifs associated with the presence of different intermolecular interactions in the formation of molecular crystals are investigated in a series of trifluoromethylated phenylhydrazones. Out of the six compounds analysed, two exhibit three-dimensional structural similarities with geometrically equivalent building blocks, while a third exists as two polymorphic forms crystallized from ethanol solutions at low temperature (277 K) and room temperature (298 K), respectively. The compounds were characterized via single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques and differential scanning calorimetry. In the absence of any strong hydrogen bonding, the supramolecular constructs are primarily stabilized via molecular pairs with a high dispersion-energy contribution, due to the presence of molecular stacking along the molecular backbone along with C—H...π interactions in the solid state, in preference to an electrostatic contribution. The interaction energies for the most stabilizing molecular building blocks are in the range −29 to −43 kJ mol −1 . In addition, weak N—H...F, C—H...F and N—H...C interactions and F...F, F...C, F...N and C...N contacts act as secondary motifs, providing additional stability to the crystal packing. The overall molecular arrangements are carefully analysed in terms of their nature and energetics, and the roles of different molecular pairs towards the crystal structure are delineated. A topological study using the quantum theory of atoms in molecules was used to characterize all the atomic interactions in the solid state. It established the presence of (3, −1) bond critical points and the closed-shell nature of all the interactions.",

The previously assumed positional shift of the crystallographically unique oxygen atom is confirmed. The shift is associated with a coupled rotation of symmetry-equivalent carbonate groups. It was possible to follow the shift using high-accuracy experiments under varying temperature conditions between 100 K and the critical transition temperature occurring at T c = 363 ± 3 K. The transition of the α-form (space group R {\\bar 3} c ; below T c ), which represents a superstructure of the β-form (space group R {\\bar 3} m , with c ′ = c /2; above T c ) was studied in detail. The tricritical order character of this displacive phase transition was verified by tracking the intensities of the recorded superstructure reflections ( l = 2 n + 1) from single-crystal diffraction and using high-precision lattice parameters obtained from powder diffraction in transmission geometry. Thermodynamic properties suggest both rotation of the CO 3 group and a coordination change of the BaO 12 coordination polyhedra as the order parameters driving the temperature-dependent α–β phase transition. Nevertheless, a detailed structural analysis reveals the coordination change of the barium atoms to be the main driving force for the observed transformation.",

In particular, the involvement of interactions involving fluorine in controlling the crystal packing requires appropriate attention, especially in the presence of other strong hydrogen bonds. In the present study, a detailed quantitative assessment has been performed of the nature, energetics and topological properties derived from the electron density in model compounds based on fluorinated benzamides (a total of 46 fluorine-substituted benzamides containing multiple fluorine atoms) in the solid state. The primary motivation in the design of such molecules is to enhance the acidity of the interacting H atoms in the presence of an increasing number of F atoms on the molecular scaffold, resulting in increased propensity towards the formation of intermolecular interactions involving organic fluorine. This exercise has resulted in the identification of new and frequently occurring supramolecular synthons involving F atoms in the packing of molecules in the solid state. The energetics associated with short and directional intermolecular Csp2-H...F-Csp2 interactions with significantly high electrostatic contributions is noteworthy, and the topological analysis reveals the bonding character of these ubiquitous interactions in crystal packing in addition to the presence of Csp2-F...F-Csp2 contacts.",

The deviation of the unit-cell parameters from cubic symmetry is small [ a = 11.64463 (1), c = 11.65481 (2) Å, c / a = 1.0009]. Point analyses and back-scattered electron images, obtained by electron-probe microanalysis, indicate a homogeneous composition. The Z 2 site is fully occupied, but the Z 1 site contains vacancies. The occupied Z 1 and Z 2 sites with Si atoms are surrounded by four O atoms, as in anhydrous cubic garnets. Pairs of split sites are O1 with F11 and O2 with O22. When the Z 1 site is vacant, a larger [(O 2 H 2 )F 2 ] tetrahedron is formed by two OH and two F anions in the O22 and F11 sites, respectively. This [(O 2 H 2 )F 2 ] tetrahedron is similar to the O 4 H 4 tetrahedron in hydrogarnets.

The H atom is bonded to an O3 atom [O3—H3 = 0.73 (2) Å]. Because of O2—Mn 3+ —O2 Jahn–Teller elongation of the Mn 3+ O 6 octahedron, a weak hydrogen bond is formed to the under-bonded O2 atom.

That work motivated the current investigation on the martensitic transformation, electronic structure and magnetism of D0 3 -ordered Mn 3 Al using first-principles calculations. Owing to tetragonal distortion, the martensitic transformation only occurs with tensile strain rather than with compressive strain and the half-metallic-type Mn 3 Al becomes a magnetic metal. Consequently, Mn 3 Al shows great potential for application as a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy. Moreover, not only did the martensitic transformation occur in Mn 3 Al, it was also observed in similar D0 3 -ordered Mn 3 Z ( Z = B, Ga, Ge, Sb) compounds.",

    "abstract": "Three new blue-luminescent complexes of selected imidazo[1,2- a ]pyridine derivatives and 1,2-phenylenediboronic acid have been synthesized and structurally characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Additionally, the crystal structures of two of the ( N , O )-donor compounds have been evaluated for the first time. The crystal packing and molecular motifs observed in the studied crystals have been thoroughly analysed, including computational studies, and are also discussed within the context of analogous systems reported in the literature. It appears that the new compounds form different crystal networks with regard to the asymmetric unit content and packing, although some similarities can be found. In all cases a typical centrosymmetric dimer bound via boronic acid groups is formed, characterized by an interaction energy of about −80 kJ mol −1 , while the 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2- a ]pyridine complex and its methoxy derivative form solvate structures, somewhat resembling the previously studied 8-oxyquinolinate analogues. As far as the spectroscopic properties are concerned, the lowest energy excitation observed in the studied complexes is based on the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital transition, and both these molecular orbitals are centred predominantly on the ( N , O )-donor species according to the results of time-dependent density functional theory. Thus, the charge transfer observed for the 8-oxyquinolinate equivalents does not occur in these cases. Consequently, the spectroscopic behaviour of the series is very much comparable with that of the parent imidazo[1,2- a ]pyridine derivatives, if the excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer process does not take place, as shown by the absorption and emission spectra collected in toluene and acetone solutions. Complexation causes a reduction in the Stokes shift compared with the respective ( N , O )-donor molecules.",

    "abstract": "Within the framework of the bond-valence model, one may write equations describing the valence-sum rule and the loop rule in terms of the constituent bond valences. These are collectively called the network equations , and can be solved for a specific bond topology to calculate its a priori bond valences. A priori bond valences are the ideal values of bond strengths intrinsic to a given bond topology that depend strictly on the formal valences of the ion at each site in the structure, and the bond-topological characteristics of the structure ( i.e. the ion connectivity). The a priori bond valences are calculated for selected rock-forming minerals, beginning with a simple example (magnesiochromite, = 1.379 bits per atom) and progressing through a series of gradually more complex minerals (grossular, diopside, forsterite, fluoro-phlogopite, phlogopite, fluoro-tremolite, tremolite, albite) to finish with epidote (= 4.187 bits per atom). The effects of weak bonds (hydrogen bonds, long Na + —O 2− bonds) on the calculation of a priori bond valences and bond lengths are examined. For the selected set of minerals, a priori and observed bond valences and bond lengths scatter closely about the 1:1 line with an average deviation of 0.04 v.u. and 0.048 Å and maximum deviations of 0.16 v.u. and 0.620 Å. The scatter of the corresponding a priori and observed bond lengths is strongly a function of the Lewis acidity of the constituent cation. For cations of high Lewis acidity, the range of differences between the a priori and observed bond lengths is small, whereas for cations of low Lewis acidity, the range of differences between the a priori and observed bond lengths is large. These calculations allow assessment of the strain in a crystal structure and provide a way to examine the effect of bond topology on variation in observed bond lengths for the same ion-pair in different bond topologies.",

    "abstract": "Cobalt ferrite ultrathin films with the inverse spinel structure are among the best candidates for spin filtering at room temperature. High-quality epitaxial CoFe 2 O 4 films about 4 nm thick have been fabricated on Ag(001) following a three-step method: an ultrathin metallic CoFe 2 alloy was first grown in coherent epitaxy on the substrate and then treated twice with O 2 , first at room temperature and then during annealing. The epitaxial orientation and the surface, interface and film structure were resolved using a combination of low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunnelling microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy and in situ grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction. A slight tetragonal distortion was observed, which should drive the easy magnetization axis in-plane due to the large magneto-elastic coupling of such a material. The so-called inversion parameter, i.e. the Co fraction occupying octahedral sites in the ferrite spinel structure, is a key element for its spin-dependent electronic gap. It was obtained through in situ resonant X-ray diffraction measurements collected at both the Co and Fe K edges. The data analysis was performed using FDMNES , an ab initio program already extensively used to simulate X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and shows that the Co ions are predominantly located on octahedral sites with an inversion parameter of 0.88 (5). Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy gives an estimation in accordance with the values obtained through diffraction analysis.",

Using group-theoretical methods, structural distortions in the Bi4Ti3O12 high-symmetry phase, caused by rotations of rigid octahedra and their displacements as a single unit, have been investigated, taking into account the connections between them. Within the Landau theory, a stable thermodynamic model of phase transitions with three order parameters has been constructed. It is shown that, according to the phenomenological phase diagram, the transition between the high-temperature tetragonal phase and the low-temperature ferroelectric can occur both directly and through intermediate states, including those observed experimentally. The role of improper ordered parameters and possible domain configurations in the structure formation of the low-temperature ferroelectric phase are discussed.",

Single crystals of DABOMD were obtained by slow crystallization in ethanol with water used as an antisolvent. The crystal structure shows a dihydrated salt comprising a magnesium cation coordinating two omeprazolate anions and two water molecules ( W 1) that are strongly bound to magnesium. In addition, two further water molecules ( W 2) are more weakly hydrogen-bonded to the pyridine nitrogen atom of each omeprazolate anion. The crystal structure was utilized to estimate key material properties for DABOMD, including crystal habit and mechanical properties, which are required for improved understanding and prediction of the behaviour of particles during pharmaceutical processing such as milling. The results from the material properties calculations indicate that DABOMD exhibits a hexagonal morphology and consists of a flat slip plane through the (100) face. It can be classed as a soft material based on elastic constant calculation and exhibits a two-dimensional hydrogen-bonding framework. Based on the crystal structure, habit and mechanical properties, it is anticipated that DABOMD will experience large disorder accompanied by plastic deformation during milling.",

Heat capacity and electrical conductivity of YbB 12 single crystals were studied in the temperature range 1.9–300 K. It is found that both the structural parameters and the indicated physical properties have some specific features in the temperature range 120–160 K. The unit cell of YbB 12 contracts when cooled below 160 K and expands at around 120 K. The temperature dependences of the equivalent atomic displacement parameters U eq ( T ) are no longer monotonic around 140 K and should be modeled by two Einstein curves for Yb and two Debye curves for boron atoms above and below this temperature. As follows from the temperature behavior of the specific heat, coupled oscillations of Yb ions in a double-well potential lead to the appearance of a charge gap in the density of states and gradual deterioration in conductive properties of the crystal below 150 K. This metal–insulator phase transition is accompanied by a kink in the U eq ( T ) curves and changes in the unit-cell values.",

However, this model does not give a quantitative description of the electron-density distribution. A better model that allows for modelling of aspherical charge density deformations is introduced by the Hansen–Coppens variant of the multipole model of electron density. However, the application of this model requires crystals of excellent quality and high-resolution XRD data which are quite often difficult criteria to fulfil. Therefore, Mo K α and Cu K α data of three model compounds (tricyclic imide, xylitol and methyluracil) were refined using IAM and new methods which enabled the refinement and reconstruction of charge density based on the Cu K α data. These methods were the Bond-Oriented Deformation Density (BODD) model, Hirshfeld Atom Refinement (HAR) and the Transferable Aspherical Atom Model (TAAM). The final results were compared to the model obtained from neutron diffraction experiments. Our results demonstrated not only that Cu K α data may be refined using BODD, HAR and TAAM methods, but also revealed systematic errors arising from the use of Cu K α data. These errors were a result of the limited information in the low-resolution data set that manifested as higher values for the anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) and smaller maxima and minima of the residual electron density for the Cu K α data compared to the Mo K α data. Notably, these systematic errors were much less significant than those found for the IAM. Therefore, the application of BODD, HAR and TAAM on Cu K α data has a more significant influence on the final results of refinement than for the Mo K α data.",

Multi-temperature single-crystal (15–340 K) and powder X-ray diffraction studies (100–400 K) reveal strongly anisotropic thermal expansion properties. The linear thermal expansion coefficients, α L ( l ), attain maximum values at 400 K along the a - and b -axis, with α L ( a ) = 115 × 10 −6 K −1 and α L ( b ) = 75 × 10 −6 K −1 . At 400 K a negative thermal expansion coefficient of −40 × 10 −6 K −1 is observed along the c -axis. The thermal expansion is coupled to a continuous deformation of the framework, which causes the structure to expand in two directions. Due to the rigidity of the linker, the expansion in the ab plane causes the network to contract along the c -axis. Hirshfeld surface analysis has been used to describe the interaction between the framework structure and the EMIM cation that resides within the channel. This reveals a number of rather weak interactions and one governing hydrogen-bonding interactions.",

From diffraction studies it was verified that the most commonly observed OR for the α-Al(Fe,Mn)Si dispersoids is [1\\bar 11]α // [1\\bar 11]Al, (5\\bar 2\\bar 7)α // (011)Al. This orientation could be explained by assuming that the internal Mackay icosahedron (MI) in the α-phase has a fixed orientation in relation to Al, similar to that of the icosahedral quasi-crystals existing in this alloy system. It is shown that mirroring of the normal-to-high-symmetry icosahedral directions of the MI explains the alternative orientations, which are therefore likely to be caused by twinning of the fixed MI. Only one exception was found, which was related to the Bergman icosahedron internal to the T-phase of the Al-Mg-Zn system.",

    "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising solid sorbents, showing gas selectivity and uptake capacities relevant to many important applications, notably in the energy sector. To improve and tailor the sorption properties of these materials for such applications, it is necessary to gain an understanding of their working mechanisms at the atomic and molecular scale. Specifically, it is important to understand how features such as framework porosity, topology, chemical functionality and flexibility underpin sorbent behaviour and performance. Such information is obtained through interrogation of structure-function relationships, with neutron powder diffraction (NPD) being a particularly powerful characterization tool. The combination of NPD with first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations enables a deep understanding of the sorption mechanisms, and the resulting insights can direct the future development of MOF sorbents. In this paper, experimental approaches and investigations of two example MOFs are summarized, which demonstrate the type of information and the understanding into their functional mechanisms that can be gained. Such information is critical to the strategic design of new materials with targeted gas-sorption properties.",

At 4.3 GPa the unit-cell volume had decreased by 14% compared with ambient conditions. The unit-cell contraction is highly anisotropic, with the a- and b-axes decreasing by 5.5 and 9.5%, respectively, and the c-axis compressing a mere 0.25% up to 1.7 GPa followed by a 0.2% expansion between 1.7 and 4.3 GPa. The 0.2% increase in length of the c-axis in this interval happens above the quasi-hydrostatic limit of the pressure-transmitting medium and therefore it might be a consequence of strain gradients. Under ambient conditions, two MnO 6 units are connected by two carboxylate ligands to form dimeric units. On increasing pressure, a non-bonded O atom from a bridging carboxylate group approaches the Mn atom, with the Mn - O distance decreasing from 2.866 (1) Å at 0.3 GPa to 2.482 (6) Å at 4.3 GPa, increasing the coordination environment of the Mn ion from six- to seven-coordinated.The structural response of a negatively charged metal-organic framework to pressure has been studied with single-crystal X-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell.",

    "abstract": "It was the Softenon disaster (see Wikipedia) that made the pharmaceutical industry fully aware of the importance of knowing the enantiomeric purity and chirality of drugs and their metabolites. This disaster involved the chiral drug Thalidomide (Fig. 1) that was sold in the 1950s as a racemate under various brand names such as Contergan and Softenon. It was shown in the early 1960s that only the R-enantiomer has the intended pharmaceutical effect and that the S-enantiomer, when the drug is used by pregnant females, may lead to serious miscarriages. Until the 1950s, the chirality of a compound could only be determined by chemical methods relative to the arbitrarily chosen ‘absolute configuration’ of (+)-R-glyceraldehyde (the Fischer–Rosanoff Convention). For a long time it was thought that X-rays could not be used to distinguish between enantiomeric structures (Friedel’s law). It was J. M. Bijvoet’s organic chemistry colleague, F. Kogl, working on the isolation of natural products and on a chirality-related cancer theory, who inspired Bijvoet to reinvestigate the possibility to directly determine the chirality of molecules such as natural and unnatural amino acids with X-ray diffraction techniques without reference to glyceraldehyde. Inspiration for the latter was gleaned from the largely forgotten paper by Coster et al. (1930) on the association of the two macroscopically distinguishable crystal 111 faces with the microscopic Zn and S layers in crystals of the inorganic compound zinc blende, ZnS, using X-ray techniques. Bijvoet realised that Friedel’s law did not apply when resonant scattering (anomalous dispersion) was taken into account. Not only the stacking polarity in crystals but also the chirality of molecules could be determined using X-ray techniques. The current notion of ‘absolute structure’ covers both polarity and chirality determination. The first absolute structure determination of an organic compound, as proof of the principle, was carried out for sodium rubidium (+)-tartrate in 1950 (Bijvoet et al., 1951). This assignment was based on careful measurement of the difference in intensity of Friedel pairs (i.e. hkl and h k l) of reflections. This was a significant experimental feat at that time in view of the long exposure time required for taking the Weissenberg diffraction images (over 200 h), hampered by unstable X-ray sources. The sign of the difference in intensity of a small number of Friedel pairs showing a large observed intensity difference was compared with the associated sign of the intensity difference calculated from the structure model. A Zr K X-ray source along with Rb as the heavy atom was chosen for a maximum anomalous difference signal. By pure chance, the determined absolute structure turned out to be consistent with the arbitrary choice made by Fischer & Rosanoff, which was good for science (avoiding confusion) but obviously with less impact in showing the power of the X-ray technique than when it would have been otherwise. Half a century later the absolute structure assignment to sodium rubidium (+)-tartrate was reaffirmed using state-of-the-art techniques (Lutz & Schreurs, 2008). With the advancement of the diffraction and computer hardware and the inclusion of anomalous dispersion contributions into the structure refinement software, it became customary to refine both enantiomeric models of a determined structure and keep the one with the lowest R-value as that representing the true absolute structure. Probability tests (e.g. the Hamilton test) to determine the validity of the chosen absolute structure were often problematic; neither were the possibilities of an enantiomerically impure sample or of a racemic mixture addressed. This situation was finally resolved with the introduction of the Flack parameter (Flack, 1983) that is based on the physically meaningful inversion twinning model defined in the range 0.0–1.0, where the limiting ISSN 2052-5206",

    "abstract": "Homogeneous and inclusion-free single crystals of 2:1 mullite (Al(4.8)Si(1.2)O(9.6)) grown by the Czochralski technique were examined by X-ray and neutron diffraction methods. The observed diffuse scattering together with the pattern of satellite reflections confirm previously published data and are thus inherent features of the mullite structure. The ideal composition was closely met as confirmed by microprobe analysis (Al(4.82 (3))Si(1.18 (1))O(9.59 (5))) and by average structure refinements. 8 (5) to 20 (13)% of the available Si was found in the T* position of the tetrahedra triclusters. The strong tendencey for disorder in mullite may be understood from considerations of hypothetical superstructures which would have to be n-fivefold with respect to the three-dimensional average unit cell of 2:1 mullite and n-fourfold in case of 3:2 mullite. In any of these the possible arrangements of the vacancies and of the tetrahedral units would inevitably be unfavorable. Three directions of incommensurate modulations were determined: q1 = [0.3137 (2) 0 ½], q2 = [0 0.4021 (5) 0.1834 (2)] and q3 = [0 0.4009 (5) -0.1834 (2)]. The one-dimensional incommensurately modulated crystal structure associated with q1 was refined for the first time using the superspace approach. The modulation is dominated by harmonic occupational modulations of the atoms in the di- and the triclusters of the tetrahedral units in mullite. The modulation amplitudes are small and the harmonic character implies that the modulated structure still represents an average structure in the overall disordered arrangement of the vacancies and of the tetrahedral structural units. In other words, when projecting the local assemblies at the scale of a few tens of average mullite cells into cells determined by either one of the modulation vectors q1, q2 or q3 a weak average modulation results with slightly varying average occupation factors for the tetrahedral units. As a result, the real structure of mullite is locally ordered (as previously known), but on the long-range its average is not completely disordered, the modulated structure of mullite may be denoted the true 'average structure of mullite'.",

These show that, in certain cases, the radiation damage, while not extreme in changing unit-cell values, can impact the existence of a phase transition. In particular, pressure-induced phase transitions are suppressed after a certain absorbed dose threshold is reached for the sample. This is thought to be due to partial amorphization and/or defect formation in the sample, hindering the co-operative structural distortions needed for a phase transition. The high-pressure experiments were conducted with several crystals within the sample chamber in order to measure crystals with minimal X-ray irradiation at the highest pressures, which are compared with the crystals measured continuously upon pressure increase. Ways to minimize radiation damage are also discussed within the frame of high-pressure experiments.",

The concept of a region of solid-state reaction that is the free space confined by a tile of the net tiling is introduced. These regions (tiles) form the reaction zone around a given atom A thus unambiguously determining the neighboring atoms that can interact with A during the transformation. The reaction zone is independent of the geometry of the crystal structure and is determined only by topological properties of the tiles. The proposed approach enables one to drastically decrease the number of trial structures when modeling phase transitions in solid state or generating new crystal substances. All crystal structures which are topologically similar to a given structure can be found by the analysis of its topological vicinity in the configuration space. Our approach predicts amorphization of the phase after the transition as well as possible single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations. This approach is applied to generate 72 new carbon allotropes from the initial experimentally determined crystalline carbon structures and to reveal four allotropes, whose hardness is close to diamond. Using the tiling model it is shown that three of them are structurally similar to other superhard carbon allotropes, M-carbon and W-carbon.",

In order to obtain a close insight into the docking mechanism for this family of compounds, the molecular and supramolecular structures of nine N-phenyl-4-oxo-4H-2-chromone carboxamides were determined. It was found that, in most of the secondary structures, the N(amido) and the O(carboxyl) of the carboxamide residue participate in strong intramolecular interactions, with the O atom of the chromene ring and with the H(ortho)-C (phenyl), respectively. When the phenyl ring had accessible acceptors as substituents a third intramolecular hydrogen bond was also observed. As a consequence, rotations of the chromone and phenyl rings around the N-C(alpha) and C(alpha')-C=O are constrained and the compounds were found to be more planar than would otherwise be expected. The deviation from planarity of the whole molecule can be quantified by the dihedral angles between mean planes of the aromatic rings and it was found that they were mainly affected by the degree of torsion of the phenyl ring with respect to the amide residue. The molecular conformations assumed by the secondary amides clearly contrast with that of a related tertiary amide that was also determined in this study. The unavailability of the N in this compound as a donor strongly influences the molecular isomerism and conformation. This analysis demonstrates that the molecules can be classified into four groups depending on the types of interactions formed as described above. If the secondary N(amido) of the carboximide is involved in two intramolecular interactions then this atom does not form any intermolecular contacts. In all other cases it does and the supramolecular structure formed is in most cases supplemented by weak C-H···O interactions.",

Using the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), it is shown that C—C≡C—H forms hydrogen bonds to N, O, S or halogens in 74% of structures in which these bonds can form. Additionally, the ethynyl group forms C—H⋯π interactions with itself or with phenyl groups in 23% of structures and accepts hydrogen bonds from O—H, N—H or C(aromatic)—H in 47% of structures where such bonds are possible. Overall, C—C≡C—H acts as a donor or acceptor in 87% of structures in which it occurs. These propensities for hydrogen-bond formation have been determined using quite tight geometrical constraints, and many more ethynyl groups form interactions with only slight relaxations of these constraints.

    "abstract": "Protonated crystals of glycine silver nitrate (C4H10Ag2N4O10) undergo a displacive kind of structural phase transition to a ferroelectric phase at 218 K. Glycine silver nitrate (GSN) is a light-sensitive crystal. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction investigations are difficult to perform on these crystals due to the problem of crystal deterioration on prolonged exposure to X-rays. To circumvent this problem, single-crystal neutron diffraction investigations were performed. We report here the crystal structure of GSN in a ferroelectric phase. The final R value for the refined structure at 150 K is 0.059. A comparison of the low-temperature structure with the room-temperature structure throws some light on the mechanism of the structural phase change in this crystal. We have attempted to explain the structural transition in GSN within the framework of the vibronic theory of ferroelectricity, suggesting that the second-order Jahn–Teller (pseudo-Jahn–Teller) behavior of the Ag+ ion in GSN leads to structural distortion at low temperature (218 K).",

    "abstract": "The structure of meneghinite (CuPb 13 Sb 7 S 24 ), from the Bottino mine in the Apuan Alps (Italy), has been solved and refined as an incommensurate structure in four-dimensional superspace. The structure is orthorhombic, superspace group Pnma (0β0)00 s , cell parameters a = 24.0549 (3), b = 4.1291 (6), c = 11.3361 (16) Å, modulation vector q = 0.5433 (4) b* . The structure was refined from 6604 reflections to a final R = 0.0479. The model includes modulation of both atomic positions and displacement parameters, as well as occupational waves. The driving forces stabilizing the modulated structure of meneghinite are linked to the occupation modulation of Cu and some of the Pb atoms. As a consequence of the Cu/[] and Pb/Sb modulations, three- to sevenfold coordinations of the M cations (Pb/Sb) occur in different parts of the structure. The almost bimodal distribution of the occupation of Cu/[] and Pb/Sb at M 5 conforms with the coupled substitution Sb 3+ + [] → Pb 2+ + Cu + , thus corroborating the hypothesis deduced previously for the incorporation of copper in the meneghinite structure. The very small departure (∼0.54 versus 0.50) from the commensurate value of the modulation raises the question of whether other sulfosalts considered superstructures have been properly described, and, in this light, if incommensurate modulation in sulfosalts could be much more common than thought.",

During the thermal relaxation, commensurate and incommensurate spin-state concentration waves (SSCWs) form. However, contrary to the steps forming at thermal equilibrium, associated with long-range SSCW order, the SSCWs forming during the relaxation from the PIHS phase correspond to short-range order, revealed by diffuse X-ray scattering. This is interpreted as resulting from the competition between the two types of SSCW order and another structural symmetry breaking, due to ligand ordering, occurring at low temperature and precluding long-range SSCW order.",

    "abstract": "Two different two-dimensional thiostannates (SnS) were synthesized using tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (tren) or 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperidine (1AEP) as structure-directing agents. Both structures consist of negatively charged thiostannate layers with charge stabilizing cations sandwiched in-between. The fundamental building units are Sn 3 S 4 broken-cube clusters connected by double sulfur bridges to form polymeric (Sn 3 S 7 2-) n honeycomb hexagonal layers. The compounds are members of the R-SnS-1 family of structures, where R indicates the type of cation. Despite consisting of identical structural units, the band gaps of the two semiconducting compounds were found to differ substantially at 2.96 eV (violet-blue light) and 3.21 eV (UV light) for tren-SnS-1 and 1AEP-SnS-1, respectively. Aiming to explain the observed differences in optical properties, the structures of the two thiostannates were investigated in detail based on combined X-ray diffraction, solid-state 13 C and 119 Sn MAS NMR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies. The compound tren-SnS-1 has a hexagonal structure consisting of planar SnS layers with regular hexagonal pores and disordered cations, whereas 1AEP-SnS-1 has an orthorhombic unit cell with ordered cations, distorted hexagonal pores and non-planar SnS layers. In the formation of 1AEP-SnS-1, an intramolecular reaction of the structure-directing piperidine takes place to form an N-heterobicyclic cation through in situ C-H activation. Hirshfeld surface analysis was used to investigate the interaction between the SnS layers and cations in 1AEP-SnS-1 and revealed that the most nucleophilic part of the SnS sheets is one of the two crystallographically distinct double sulfur bridges.",

    "abstract": "Labuntsovite-Fe, an Fe-dominant member of the labuntsovite subgroup, was first discovered in the Khibiny alkaline massif on Mt Kukisvumchorr [Khomyakov et al. (2001). Zap. Vseross. Mineral. Oba, 130 , 36–45]. However, no data are published about the crystal structure of this mineral. Labuntsovite-Fe from a peralkaline pegmatite located on Mt Nyorkpakhk, in the Khibiny alkaline complex, Kola Peninsula, Russia, has been investigated by means of electron microprobe analyses, single-crystal X-ray structure refinement, and IR and Raman spectroscopies. Monoclinic unit-cell parameters of labuntsovite-Fe are: a = 14.2584 (4), b = 13.7541 (6), c = 7.7770 (2) Å, β = 116.893 (3)°; V = 1360.22 (9) Å 3 ; space group C 2/ m . The structure was refined to final R 1 = 0.0467, wR 2 = 0.0715 for 3202 reflections [ I &gt; 3σ( I )]. The refined crystal chemical formula is ( Z = 2): Na 2 K 2 Ba 0.7 [(Fe 0.5 Ti 0.1 Mg 0.05 )(H 2 O) 1.3 ]{[Ti 2 (Ti 1.9 Nb 0.1 )(O,OH) 4 ][Si 4 O 12 ] 2 }·4H 2 O. The high-pressure in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of the labuntsovite-Fe has been carried out in a diamond anvil cell. The labuntsovite-type structure is stable up to 23 GPa and phase transitions are not observed. Calculations using the BM3 equation of state resulted in the bulk modulus K = 72 (2) GPa, K ′ 0 = 3.7 (2) and V 0 = 1363 (2) Å 3 . Compressing of the heteropolyhedral zeolite-like framework leads to the deformation of main structural units. Octahedral rods show the gradual increase of distortion and the wave-like character of rods becomes more distinct. Rod deformations result in the distortion of the silicon–oxygen ring which is not equal in different directions. Structural channels are characterized by a different ellipticity–pressure relationship: the cross-section of the largest channel I and channel II demonstrates the stability of the geometrical characteristics which practically do not depend on pressure: ∊ channel I ≃ 0.85 (4) (cross-section is rather regular) and ∊ channel II ≃ 0.52 (2) within the whole pressure range. However, channel III is characterized by the increasing of ellipticity with pressure (∊ = 0.40 → 0.10).",

Rietveld refinement of X-ray data for hydrothermal K2X2+Si5O12 (X = Fe2+, Co, Zn) samples shows that they crystallize in the monoclinic space group P21/c and have tetrahedral cations (Si and X) ordered onto distinct framework sites [cf. hydrothermal K2MgSi5O12; Bell et al. (1994a), Acta Cryst. B50, 560-566]. Dry-synthesized K2X2+Si5O12 (X = Co, Zn) and Rb2X2+Si5O12 (X = Mn) samples crystallize in the cubic space group Ia{\\overline 3}d and with Si and X cations disordered in the tetrahedral framework sites as typified by dry K2MgSi5O12. Both structure types have tetrahedrally coordinated SiO4 and XO4 sharing corners to form a partially substituted silicate framework. Extraframework K+ and Rb+ cations occupy large channels in the framework. Structural data for the ordered samples show that mean tetrahedral Si-O and X-O bond lengths cover the ranges 1.60 Å (Si-O) to 2.24 Å (Fe2+-O) and show an inverse relationship with the intertetrahedral angles (T-O-T) which range from 144.7° (Si-O-Si) to 124.6° (Si-O-Fe2+). For the compositions with both disordered and ordered tetrahedral cation structures (K2MgSi5O12, K2CoSi5O12, K2ZnSi5O12, Rb2MnSi5O12 and Cs2CuSi5O12 leucites) the disordered polymorphs always have larger unit-cell volumes, larger intertetrahedral T-O-T angles and smaller mean T-O distances than their isochemical ordered polymorphs. The ordered samples clearly have more flexible frameworks than the disordered structures which allow the former to undergo a greater degree of tetrahedral collapse around the interframework cavity cations. Multivariant linear regression has been used to develop equations to predict intertetrahedral T-O-T angle variation depending on the independent variables Si-O and X-O bond lengths, cavity cation ideal radius, intratetrahedral (O-T-O) angle variance, and X cation electronegativity.",

Surprisingly, given its significance in industrial and medical applications, the structure of calcium D-gluconate has not previously been reported. Unexpectedly, the gluconate crystal structure comprises coordination polymers. Unusually, the calcium coordination number is nine. Adjacent metal centres are linked by three μ-oxo bridges, with a metal–metal separation of 3.7312 (2) Å. One of the gluconate ligands contradicts a suggestion from 1974 that a straight chain conformation is associated with an intramolecular hydrogen bond. This ligand binds to three adjacent metal centres. The use of synchrotron radiation provided an improved crystal structure with respect to that previously reported for the isosaccharinate complex, allowing the location of the hydroxy hydrogen sites to be elucidated. In contrast to the gluconate structure, there are no μ-oxo bridges in the isosaccharinate coordination polymer and the isosaccharinate bridging coordination is such that the distance between adjacent metal centres, each of which is eight-coordinate, is 6.7573 (4) Å. Complementing the crystal structure determinations, modelling studies of the geometries and coordination modes for the aqueous [CaGluc] + and [CaIsa] + complexes are presented and discussed.",

A `multi-crystal' approach was used in crystal structure determination, significantly improving completeness of X-ray diffraction data attainable for such a low-symmetry system. The crystal structure consists of infinite π-stacks of PA molecules with discernible dimers, which resemble aggregates formed by pyrene derivatives in solution as well as in the solid state. A series of measurements showed that the average inter-planar distance between individual molecules within π-stacks decreases with pressure in the investigated range. This results in piezochromic properties of PA: a significant sample color change as well as a red-shift of fluorescence with pressure, as studied with UV-vis spectroscopy. Periodic DFT calculations allowed us to relate the variations in the crystal structure with pressure to the changes in the electronic structure of this material.",

    "abstract": "Four basaltic phenocryst samples of plagioclase, with compositions ranging from An 48 (andesine) to An 64 (labradorite), have been studied with single-crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction techniques. The samples were also subjected to a heating experiment at 1100°C for two weeks in an effort to minimize the Al–Si ordering in their structures. The average and the modulated structures of the samples (before and after the heating experiment) were compared, in order to understand the mechanism of the phase transition from the disordered C\\bar 1 structure to the e -plagioclase structure. A comparison between the structures from neutron and X-ray diffraction data shows that the 〈 T —O〉 distance does not solely depend on the Al occupancy as previously thought. A dramatic decrease of the Al–Si ordering is observed after heating at 1100°C for two weeks for all four samples, with an obvious change in the intensities of the satellite reflections ( e -reflections) in the diffraction pattern. Evident changes in the modulation period were also observed for the more calcic samples. No obvious change in the Ca–Na ordering was observed after the heating experiment. An in situ heating X-ray diffraction experiment was carried out on the andesine sample (An 48 ) to study the change in the satellite intensity at high temperature. A dramatic weakening of the satellite peaks was observed between 477°C and 537°C, which strongly supports the displacive nature of the initiation of e 2 ordering. Rigid-Unit Mode (RUM) analysis of the plagioclase structure suggests the initial position of the e -reflections is determined by the anti-RUMs in the framework.",

However, the polymorphism and solvates of RSV cocrystals have not been studied comprehensively. In addition, the relationship between the crystal packing modes and their physicochemical properties of RSV cocrystals remains poorly understood. In this paper, seven novel RSV cocrystals were prepared and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic vapor sorption, Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Five RSV–4,4′-vinylenedipyridine (DPE) cocrystals were synthesized with polymorphs and solvates, such as RSV–DPE (1:2) in form (I) [RSV–2DPE form (I)], RSV–DPE (1:2) in form (II) [RSV–2DPE form (II)], RSV–DPE (1:1) (RSV–DPE), RSV–DPE (2:3)·acetone (RSV–1.5DPE·0.5ACE), RSV–DPE (1:1.5)·MeOH (RSV–1.5DPE·MeOH).

RSV–2DPE form (II) can be transformed from RSV–2DPE form (I) during the heating process from single crystal to single crystal. The physicochemical properties of RSV cocrystals are closely related to their crystal packing modes. Also, the conformation and molecular packing of RSV among different cocrystals is flexible. The solubility of RSV–1.5BPE and RSV–2DPE form (II) exhibit higher than RSV in the buffer solution of pH 4.6 and 2.0, respectively. This study may provide a valuable insight into the crystal packing modes of cocrystals which may affect their physicochemical properties.",

The two heterocyclic chalcones were found to be less soluble in all solvents tested and to have higher melting points than trans-chalcone, probably due to their stronger intermolecular interactions arising from the functionalized rings. Interestingly, however, it was found that the addition of the thiophene ring in (E)-1-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-3-(thiophen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one increased both the melting point and solubility of the sample compared with (E)-3-phenyl-1-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one.

    "abstract": "Electrical and thermal transport controlled by growth mode can be used to optimize thermoelectric properties of ZnO:Al films, which was adjusted by the re-evaporation of Zn and Al via substrate temperatures. The growth modes include equiaxed crystal, columnar crystal and coexistence of both crystals. In the ZnO:Al film, equiaxed crystals improve the carrier mobility and reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Thus, the carrier mobility and thermal conductivity are tuned by the ratio of equiaxed crystals to columnar crystals. The carrier mobility is dependent on the growth-mode-related defects of oxygen vacancies, zinc interstitials and the substitutional dopant of Al. Improved thermoelectric properties with a power factor of 198.45 µW m-1 K-2 at 510 K were achieved. This study presents a film with the structure of an equiaxed-crystal buffer layer to enhance its thermoelectric properties.",

    "abstract": "A pure crystallogeometrical approach is proposed for predicting orientation relationships, habit planes and atomic structures of the interfaces between phases, which is applicable to systems of low-symmetry phases and epitaxial thin film growth. The suggested models are verified with the example of epitaxial growth of α-, γ- and β-FeSi2 silicide thin films on silicon substrates. The density of near-coincidence sites is shown to have a decisive role in the determination of epitaxial thin film orientation and explains the superior quality of β-FeSi2 thin grown on Si(111) over Si(001) substrates despite larger lattice misfits. Ideal conjunctions for interfaces between the silicide phases are predicted and this allows for utilization of a thin buffer α-FeSi2 layer for oriented growth of β-FeSi2 nanostructures on Si(001). The thermal expansion coefficients are obtained within quasi-harmonic approximation from the DFT calculations to study the influence of temperature on the lattice strains in the derived interfaces. Faster decrease of misfits at the α-FeSi2(001)||Si(001) interface compared to γ-FeSi2(001)||Si(001) elucidates the origins of temperature-driven change of the phase growing on silicon substrates. The proposed approach guides from bulk phase unit cells to the construction of the interface atomic structures and appears to be a powerful tool for the prediction of interfaces between arbitrary phases for subsequent theoretical investigation and epitaxial film synthesis.",

The crystal unit-cell dimensions, phase concentration and atomic position coordinates were determined by Rietveld refinement. The short-range structure of CaMoO4 consists of tetrahedral MoO4 and snub disphenoid deltahedral CaO8 units, while the unit cell of Er2O3 consists of two types of ErO6 octahedral units. All MoO4 units contain Mo-O bonds of equal lengths, whereas two types of slightly different Ca-O bond lengths exist in CaO8. Raman spectra of the doped samples show only Mo-O vibrational modes and the Raman peaks of Er2O3 are masked by Mo-O bond vibrations. CaMoO4 shows bluish-green emission at 500 nm, while Er-doped samples show strong green emission under UV excitation. UV irradiation (380 nm) induces down-conversion green emission at 531 nm and 552 nm and good color purity in 1 mol% Er2O3-CaMoO4 sample which makes it a potential candidate for applications in optical devices.",

We conclude that the Besnus transition is a magnetically driven transition characterised by the rotation of the moments out of the ac-plane, accompanied by small atomic displacements that lower the symmetry to triclinic at low temperatures. Based on our phase diagram, we predict related magnetically driven phase transitions at low temperatures in all the commensurate superstructures of pyrrhotite. The exact nature of the transition is determined by the symmetry of the vacancy ordered state Based on this we predict spin-flop transitions in 3C and 5C pyrrhotite and a transition akin to the Besnus transition in 6C pyrrhotite. Furthermore, we clarify that 3C and 4C pyrrhotite carry a ferrimagnetic moment whereas 5C and 6C are antiferromagnetic.",

Evidence is presented in this article indicating that typical commercial h -BN platelets (∼10–500 nm in thickness) exhibit stacks of parallel nanosheets (∼10 nm in thickness) predominantly in the AB sequence. The AB-stacked nanosheet occurs as a metastable phase of h -BN resulting from the preferred texture and lateral growth of armchair (110) planes. It appears as an independent nanosheet or unit for h -BN platelets. The analysis is supported by simulation of thin AB films (2–20 layers), which explains the unique X-ray diffraction pattern of h -BN. With this analysis and the role of pressure in commercial high-pressure high-temperature sintering (driving nucleation and parallelizing the in-plane crystalline growth of the nuclei), a growth mechanism is proposed for 2D h -BN (on a substrate) as `substrate-induced 2D growth', where the substrate plays the role of pressure.",

The studied samples are unique in their chemical features and the distribution of cations over structural sites. In particular, the sample from the Gordon Butte pegmatite is a member of the barytolamprophyllite–emmerichite solid solution series, whereas the samples from the Murun alkaline complex and from the Rocky Boy pegmatite are intermediate members of the solid solution series formed by lamprophyllite and a hypothetical Sr analogue of emmerichite. The predominance of O 2− over OH − and F − at the X site is a specific feature of sample Cha-192 from the Murun alkaline complex. New data on the Raman spectra of LGMs obtained in this work show that the wavenumbers of the O—H stretching vibrations depend on the occupancies of the M 2 and M 3 sites coordinating with (OH) − groups. Cations other than Na + and Ti 4+ (mainly, Mg and Fe 3+ ) can play a significant role in the coordination of the X site occupied by (OH) − . Data on polarized Raman spectra of an oriented sample indicate that the OH groups having different local coordinations have similar orientations with respect to the crystal. The calculated measures of similarity (Δ) for lamprophyllite and ericssonite are identical (0.157 and 0.077 for the 2 M - and 2 O -polytypes, respectively), which indicates that these minerals are crystal-chemically isotypic and probably should be considered within the same mineral group by analogy to the other mineralogical groups which combine isotypic minerals.",

The solid-state electronegativities are generally lower than the conventional (`molecular') values, due to different coordination numbers and electronic structure in a solid versus a molecule; the decrease is stronger for metals than for non-metals, hence binary compounds have a wider EN difference and higher bond polarity (ionicity) in the solid than in the molecular (gaseous) state. Under high pressure, the ENs of metals increase and those of non-metals decrease, the binary solid becomes less polar and can ultimately dissociate into elements.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the use of in situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and quantitative phase analysis using the Rietveld method to monitor the structural properties of a titania-supported iron (10% Fe/TiO2) pre-catalyst during calcination (oxidation) and activation (reduction) in the temperature range 25-900°C. The TiO2 oxidation study revealed an increase in anatase particle size before the anatase to rutile phase transformation, lending credibility to the bridging mechanism proposed by Kim et al. [(2007), Mater. Sci. Forum, 534-536, 65-68]. Pre-catalyst oxidation experiments allowed for the determination of a suitable calcination temperature (450°C) of the pre-catalyst in terms of maximum hematite concentration and appropriate particle size. These experiments also confirmed that the anatase to rutile phase transformation occurred at higher temperatures after Fe addition and that anatase was the sole donor of Ti(4+) ions, which are known to migrate into hematite (Gennari et al., 1998), during the formation of pseudobrookite (Fe2TiO5) at temperatures above 690°C. Using the results from the oxidation experiments, two pre-catalyst samples were calcined at different temperatures; one to represent the preferred case and one to represent a case where the pre-catalyst had been excessively heated. Samples of the excessively heated catalysts were exposed to different reducing gas atmospheres (5, 10 and 100% H2/N2) and heated in the in situ PXRD reactor, so that diffraction data could be collected during the activation process. The results show that reduction with gases containing low concentrations of H2 (5 and 10%) led to the formation of ilmenite (FeTiO3) and we were able to show that both anatase and rutile are consumed in the reaction. Higher concentrations of H2 led to the formation of magnetite (Fe3O4) and metallic iron (Fe(0)). We also noted a decrease in the anatase to rutile transformation temperature under reducing atmospheres when compared with the pre-catalyst heat-treatment experiment. A reduced calcination temperature prior to reduction allowed more facile Fe reduction.",

The MFI-type zeolite has two kinds of orthogonal channels: straight channels and sinusoidal channels. The mouths of the straight channels are on (010) crystal faces, while those of the sinusoidal channels are on (100) faces. The channel mouths are directly sealed by silicone resin on the (100) and (010) faces so as to restrict the entrance and diffusion pathways to straight and sinusoidal channel pathways, respectively. The locations and loadings of the guest CO 2 and DME molecules are determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction structural analysis. The loadings show the difference of the adsorption rates between the pathways. The straight channel pathway is 4.2 times faster than the sinusoidal channel pathway for the CO 2 , and the sinusoidal channel pathway is 5.1 times faster than the straight channel pathway for the DME. It reveals their dominant pathways and the anisotropy of adsorption. The dominant pathway correlates to the stability of the channel as adsorption sites.",

The model demonstrates that what we observe when the water leaves the crystal is partial transformation from the parent form to a child form (a new form, less hydrated and structurally related to the parent). Yet this `dried' structure is not a pure phase. It consists of semi-random layers of both child, parent and an interfacial layer which has a modulated structure that represents a transitory phase. Understanding the fact that a single `dried' crystal can have the disordered layer structure described as well as understanding mechanistic relationships between the phases involved can have implications in understanding the effect of common large scale bulk drying procedures. During the development of BMS-927711, difficulties did arise during characterization of the dried bulk when using only routine solid-state analysis. The material is now better understood from this diffraction study. The diffraction experiments also reveal intermodulation satellites, which upon interpretation yield even more structural information about the crystal transformation. The model suggests the mechanism of transformation is laminar in which layers of the crystal are driven to approach a stable B-centered supercell phase of lower water content.",

    "abstract": "The active pharmaceutical ingredient phloroglucinol (PHL) has been taken as an illustrative molecule to explore the intermolecular interactions which can be established with other molecular entities to build PHL pharmaceutical co-crystals. The crystal structures of five newly synthesized co-crystals are reported, where PHL is crystallized with N -heterocycles, namely 2-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine (1), 2,4-dimethyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (2), 4-phenylpyridine (3), 2-hydroxypyridine (4) and 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine (5). The structural characteristics of these co-crystals, as far as the hydrogen-bonding networks and the crystalline architectures are concerned, are strongly dependent on the chemical features of the coformer molecules, as well as on their size and shape. A detailed analysis of the intermolecular interactions established in all the PHL co-crystals of known structures has allowed the recognition of some regularities in the packing modes that can be useful in the design of new supramolecular adducts forming predictable structural motifs.",

    "abstract": "The crystal structure of a new crystalline phase, polymorph (II) of isobutyl-6-amino-5-cyano-2-methyl-4-phenyl-4 H -pyran-3-carboxylate, was accurately determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis providing a clean identification of polymorphic forms. Comparison with a known phase, referred to as polymorph (I), reveals the type of supramolecular assembly. Inter- and intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions exhibit various supramolecular architectures in crystal packing and these variations confirm well the polymorphism in isobutyl-6-amino-5-cyano-2-methyl-4-phenyl-4 H -pyran-3-carboxylate (IAPC) crystal structure. Crystal cohesion is achieved by N—H...N, N—H...O and C—H...H—C interactions, responsible for the formation and strengthening of the supramolecular assembly. The objective of this investigation is to study crystalline forms which can offer enhanced physicochemical properties, and also to recognize the molecular orientations between such forms. The conformational polymorphs of IAPC were compared spectroscopically by FT–IR and FT–Raman. The bulk phases were studied by X-ray powder diffraction patterns. External morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscopic images. The molecular interactions were quantified using Hirshfeld surface and fingerprint analysis. Density functional theory (DFT) computations were used to optimize the structure. The optimized structure is further subjected to an analysis of Mulliken population, natural population and electrostatic potential.",

Both approaches give quite similar results. The structure possesses oxygen disorder in the oxygen-rich region of the BiO layer. An extra O atom is determined in the bridging position shifted ∼ 0.6 Å from BiO towards the SrO layer. Its presence is the cause of the tremendous increase of the bismuth U(11) atomic displacement parameter in ∼ 20% of the unit cells (t = -0.05-0.15). Vacancies are determined in the oxygen site of the SrO layer, which may result in the oxygen content variation with annealing at different oxygen pressures.

According to our analysis, the two basic patterns of self-assembly of GE esters observed in their unsolvated crystals correspond to two distinct orientations of the ester groups relative to the triterpene backbone. Moreover, comparison of the self-assembly modes of GE esters in their unsolvated forms with the supramolecular organization of GE and carbenoxolone in their solvated crystals revealed that ester substituents replace solvent molecules hydrogen bonded to the COOH group at the triterpene skeleton, resulting in similar packing arrangements of these compounds.",

The analysis revolves around the resonant-scattering contribution to differences in intensity between Friedel opposites hkl and \\bar h\\bar k\\bar l. The following techniques were used: R(merge) factors on the average (A) and difference (D) of Friedel opposites; statistical estimates of the resonant-scattering contribution to Friedel opposites; plots of 2A(obs) against 2A(model) and of D(obs) against D(model); the antisymmetric D-Patterson function. Moreover it was possible to show that a non-standard atomic model was unnecessary to describe TiGePt. Two data sets are compared. That measured with Ag Kα radiation at 295 K to a resolution of 1.25 Å(-1) is less conclusive than the one measured with Mo Kα radiation at 100 K to the lower resolution of 0.93 Å(-1). This result is probably due to the fact that the resonant scattering of Pt is larger for Mo Kα than for AgKα radiation.",

Two conventional refinements (different superstructure approximations that differ in the placement of their crystallographic inversion centers) and a (3 + 1)-dimensional superspace refinement are all nearly equally successful, at least as measured by the usual agreement factors; the data integration, however, shows that the incommensurate description is preferable. The overall packing is determined by the stacking of the aromatic rings and probably by the segregation of As and Cl atoms to give short As...Cl contacts. A refinement of the average (Z' = 1) structure shows that there are two basic orientations of the C6S2 plane, but that those orientations must be correlated in several directions to avoid impossibly short intermolecular contacts. Along the modulation vector q the orientation of the C6S2 plane varies smoothly, but q is not a direction in which the molecules are in contact. Along the directions in which the molecules are in contact the orientation of the C6S2 plane alternates; there are also positional shifts. The single modulation q relieves packing problems in several different directions well enough that crystals that diffract well can be grown.",

    "abstract": "The high-temperature clinoenstatite (HT-CEn) is one of the most important MgSiO3 pyroxene polymorphs, but the details of its structure and stability have been uncertain. The single crystal of the C2/c HT-CEn end-member is firstly synthesized by rapid pressure–temperature quenching from 15–16 GPa and 1173–2173 K. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows unusual bonding distances and static disorder of the atoms frozen in this metastable structure. The degree of kinking of the silicate tetrahedral chains is 175° for HT-CEn. The chain angle for HP-CEn is substantially smaller (135°), but the angle for L-CEn is in the opposite direction at −160° (= 200°). The degree of kinking increases by being curved by more than 180° for the transition from HT-CEn to L-CEn. As for the reverse change from the expansion to the stretch, a potential barrier exists at the point of the continuity. It is suggested that the reason why a structure can be quenched under ambient conditions is as follows: the present HT-CEn single crystal has been formed by the isosymmetric phase transition from the high-pressure C2/c clinoenstatite (HP-CEn). The presence of HT-CEn from HP-CEn in natural rocks is an indicator of quenching history, which leads to the possibility that it exists in shocked meteorites and impact materials.",

For both compounds no evidence of a structural phase transition in the investigated range of temperatures was found. The thermal expansions are found to be anisotropic, with the largest thermal expansion along a direction parallel to the slabs of these layered compounds. The origin of this anisotropy is proposed to be a temperature dependence of tilts of the octahedral (Ti,Fe)O6 groups. It is likely that the same mechanism will determine similar anisotropic thermal behaviour of other compounds A(n)B(n)O(3n + 2). The crystal structures have revealed partial chemical order of Ti/Fe over the B sites, with iron concentrated towards the centers of the slabs. Local charge compensation is proposed as the driving force for the chemical order, where the highest-valent cation moves to sites near the oxygen-rich borders of the slabs. A linear dependence on the site occupation fraction by Fe of the computed valences leads to extrapolated valence values close to the formal valence of Ti(4+) for sites fully occupied by Ti, and of Fe(3+) for sites fully occupied by Fe. These results demonstrate the power of the bond-valence method, and they show that refined oxygen positions are the weighted average of oxygen positions in TiO6 and FeO6 octahedral groups.",

The strength of the halogen-bonding interactions is assessed by examining binding energies, electron charge transfer (NBO analysis) and electron density at halogen-bond critical points (AIM theory). Specifically, structural motifs having intramolecular N— X ...N ( X = Cl, Br, or I) interactions and the ability to drive molecular self-assembly via the same type of interactions are used to construct larger self-assemblies of up to three unit motifs. N— X ...N halogen-bond cooperativity as a function of the self-assembly size, and the nature of the halogen atom is also examined. The cyclic network of the halogen-bonding interactions provides a suitable cavity rich in electron density (from the halogen atom lone pairs not involved in the halogen bonds) that can potentially bind an electron-deficient species such as a metal ion. This possibility is explored by examining the ability of the N— X ...N network to bind Na + . Likewise, molecular self-assembly structures driven by the weaker C— X ...N halogen-bonding interactions are investigated and the results compared with those of their N— X ...N counterparts.",

The algorithm, which we implemented in a computer program named ChiChi, is able to compare isomeric residues based on the chiral centres that were identified. This allows for discrimination between enantiomers, diastereomers and constitutional isomers that are present in crystallographic databases. ChiChi was used to process 254 354 organic entries from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).

The compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction and the first hyperpolarizability and the second-order susceptibility were obtained from theoretical calculations. Furthermore, a new method to measure the second-harmonic (SH) efficiency on a small quantity of powder at different wavelengths of excitation was optimized and an attempt was made to assess the reduction of the SH intensity for small quantities of nano-crystals, in order to ascertain the possibility of applications in biological systems.

Four complexes of (PyH)z[M(mnt)2]z-, where M = Ni or Cu, z = 2 or 1 and PyH+ = C5NH6+, were studied in order to clarify whether such one-electron oxidation-reduction, [M(mnt)2]2-/[M(mnt)2]1-, is taking place at the metal or the ligand site.

The bonding characters in terms of topological properties associated with the bond critical points are compared between the oxidized form [ML]- and the reduced form [ML]2-.

    "abstract": "In statistics, the index of dispersion (or variance-to-mean ratio) is unity (σ 2 /〈 x 〉 = 1) for a Poisson-distributed process with variance σ 2 for a variable x that manifests as unit increments. Where x is a measure of some phenomenon, the index takes on a value proportional to the quanta that constitute the phenomenon. That outcome might thus be anticipated to apply for an enormously wide variety of applied measurements of quantum phenomena. However, in a photon-energy proportional radiation detector, a set of M witnessed Poisson-distributed measurements { W 1 , W 2 ,… W M } scaled so that the ideal expectation value of the quantum is unity, is generally observed to give σ 2 /〈 W 〉 &lt; 1 because of detector losses as broadly indicated by Fano [ Phys. Rev. (1947), 72 , 26]. In other cases where there is spectral dispersion, σ 2 /〈 W 〉 &gt; 1. Here these situations are examined analytically, in Monte Carlo simulations, and experimentally. The efforts reveal a powerful metric of quanta broadly associated with such measurements, where the extension has been made to polychromatic and lossy situations. In doing so, the index of dispersion's variously established yet curiously overlooked role as a metric of underlying quanta is indicated. The work's X-ray aspects have very diverse utility and have begun to find applications in radiography and tomography, where the ability to extract spectral information from conventional intensity detectors enables a superior level of material and source characterization.",

Two of the structure types identified are based on dinuclear rare earth units that differ in their crystal chemistries, particularly with respect to the role of fluorine as a structural director. The broad study of rare earth ions provides greater insight into understanding structural variations within silicate frameworks and the nature of f -block incorporation in oxyanion frameworks. The single crystals are grown from high-temperature ( ca 953 K) hydrothermal fluids, demonstrating the versatility of the technique to access new phases containing recalcitrant rare earth oxides, enabling the study of structural trends.",

Crystal packing of IsI and HyI shows weak I...N and I...π halogen bonds, whereas the hydrogen bonds are dominant in the brominated scaffolds IsBr and HyBr. Although the calculated I...N interaction strength appears almost three times weaker than the O—H...N contacts in the isoniazid-based hydrazones, the higher directionality of the halogen bonds induces a linear and planar architecture of self-complementary tectons, observed only with the help of a bridging water molecule in the case of IsOH. Finally, the X-ray structure of HyOH is characterized by an unexpected linear arrangement of clathrated dichloromethane molecules bound through type I and II halogen bonds.

Unfortunately, ion-migration pathways could not be mapped by modelling anharmonic ion displacement or by inspecting the scattering-length density that was reconstructed via maximum-entropy methods. However, analyses of the topology and bond-valence site energies derived from the high-temperature structure reveal that the anions can migrate roughly along the edges of the LiF 6 coordination octahedra with an estimated migration barrier of ∼0.64 eV (if a vacancy permits), whereas the lithium ions are confined to their crystallographic positions. This finding is not only valid for the title compound but for ion migration in all perovskites with Goldschmidt tolerance factors near unity.",

    "abstract": "A new film material capable of transforming UV radiation into visible light was obtained from a highly anisometric EuIII complex with organic ligands in a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) matrix and then structurally characterized. An important advantage of the synthesized complex is its good solubility in organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, THF, toluene, etc. The ligand environment (flexible alkyl and cyclohexyl substituents) of the EuIII complex was selected to prevent crystallization, to inhibit the formation of defects in the structure of films and to provide its uniform distribution in the polymer during polymerization. As a result we obtain an EuIII complex of the film with remarkable thermal behavior: the complex melts to isotropic liquid without decomposition, it supercools at ambient temperature and it forms a stable amorphous material at low (up to -30°C) temperatures. The films were prepared by two methods: bulk polymerization and spin coating. A comparison of the differences of luminescent and optical characteristics of micro- and nanosized PMMA films doped with the anisometric EuIII complex is given. Based on X-ray powder diffraction and small-angle scattering data, it has been supposed that the association of EuIII complex molecules occurs in the voids of the PMMA matrix and is accompanied by the formation of a nanocrystalline phase. For films obtained by spin coating, a deeper microphase separation is demonstrated than by bulk polymerization. The dimensional characteristics of the nano-associates were determined and a correlation between the method of preparation and the type of distribution of the EuIII complex in the PMMA matrix is established.",

In response, the environment of a NWire experiences a NWire stress response which may lead to propagated strain and a change in the shape and size of the NWire cross section. Here, geometric number series are deduced for zincblende- (zb-) and diamond-structured NWires of diameter d Wire to obtain the numbers of NWire atoms N Wire ( d Wire [ i ]), bonds between NWire atoms N bnd ( d Wire [ i ]) and interface bonds N IF ( d Wire [ i ]) for six high-symmetry zb NWires with the low-index faceting that occurs frequently in both bottom-up and top-down approaches of NWire processing. Along with these primary parameters, the specific lengths of interface facets, the cross-sectional widths and heights and the cross-sectional areas are presented. The fundamental insights into NWire structures revealed here offer a universal gauge and thus could enable major advancements in data interpretation and understanding of all zb- and diamond-structure-based NWires. This statement is underpinned with results from the literature on cross-section images from III–V core–shell NWire growth and on Si NWires undergoing self-limiting oxidation and etching.

As such, the phase rarely appears on phase diagrams of the group VB transition metal carbides. There is currently renewed interest in this phase, as tantalum carbide composites exhibit high fracture toughness in the presence of this phase. This work extends the initial computational study using density functional theory of the phase stability of the zeta phase in the tantalum carbide system, where the tantalum carbide zeta-phase crystal structure and stability were determined, to the niobium and vanadium carbides. It is shown that the zeta phases in the three systems share the same crystal structure and it is an equilibrium phase at low temperatures. The carbon atom ordering in the three different phases is explored and it is demonstrated that the zeta phase in the tantalum carbides prefers to order carbon atoms differently than in the niobium and vanadium carbide zeta phases. Finally, the properties of this crystal are computed, including elastic constants, electronic densities of states and phonon dispersion curves, to illustrate that this crystal structure is similar to other transition metal carbides.",

    "abstract": "Labradorite feldspars of the plagioclase solid solution series have been known for their complicated subsolidus phase relations and enigmatic incommensurately modulated structures. Characterized by the irrationally indexed e -reflections in the diffraction pattern, e -labradorite shows the largest variation in the incommensurate ordering states among the e -plagioclase structures. The strongly ordered low-temperature e -labradorite is one of the last missing pieces of the e -plagioclase puzzle. Nine plutonic and metamorphic labradorite feldspar samples from Canada, Ukraine, Minnesota (USA), Tanzania and Greenland with compositions ranging from An 52.5 to An 68 were studied with single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Two crystals from Labrador, Canada, and Duluth, MN, USA, with wide enough twin lamellae were analyzed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The incommensurately modulated structures of e -plagioclase are refined for the first time with neutron diffraction data, which confirmed that the T—O distance modulation in the low-temperature e -plagioclase results from the Al–Si ordering in the framework. Detailed configurations of the M site are also observed in the structures refined from neutron diffraction data, which were not possible to see with X-ray diffraction data. The relation between the q -vectors and the mole% An composition is revealed for the entire compositional range of e -plagioclase, from An 25 to An 75 . The previously proposed two-trend relation depending on the cooling rate and phase transition path is confirmed. A new classification of e -plagioclase ( e α , e β and e γ ) is proposed based on the q -vector of the structure, which makes it an independent character from the presence/absence of density modulation. New parameters are proposed to quantify the ordering states of these complicated aperiodic structures of e -plagioclases, such as the difference between 〈T 1 o—O〉 and 〈T 1 m—O〉 at phase t = 0.2 or the normalized intensity of the (071\\bar 1) reflection.",

    "abstract": "Statistical analysis of data from crystal structures extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) has shown that S and Se atoms display a similar tendency towards specific types of interaction if they are part of a fragment that corresponds to the side chains of cysteine (Cys), methionine (Met) selenocysteine (Sec) and selenomethionine (Mse). The most numerous are structures with C—H...Se and C—H...S interactions (∼80%), notably less numerous are structures with Se...Se and S...S interactions (∼5%), and Se...π and S...π interactions are the least numerous. The results of quantum-chemical calculations have indicated that C—H...Se (∼−0.8 kcal mol −1 ) and C—H...S interactions are weaker than the most stable parallel interaction (∼−3.3 kcal mol −1 ) and electrostatic interactions of σ/π type (∼−2.6 kcal mol −1 ). Their significant presence can be explained by the abundance of CH groups compared with the numbers of Se and S atoms in the crystal structures, and also by the influence of substituents bonded to the Se or S atom that further reduce their possibilities for interacting with species from the environment. This can also offer an explanation as to why O—H...Se (∼−4.4 kcal mol −1 ) and N—H...Se interactions (∼−2.2 kcal mol −1 ) are less numerous. Docking studies revealed that S and Se rarely participate in interactions with the amino acid residues of target enzymes, mostly because those residues preferentially interact with the substituents bonded to Se and S. The differences between Se and S ligands in the number and positions of their binding sites are more pronounced if the substituents are polar and if there are more Se/S atoms in the ligand.",

    "abstract": "Manufacturing high-quality zinc oxide (ZnO) devices demands control of the orientation of ZnO materials due to the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarity perpendicular to the c-plane. However, flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices are mostly built on polymers or glass substrates which lack suitable epitaxy seeds for the orientation control. Applying cubic-structure seeds, it was possible to fabricate polar c-plane and nonpolar m-plane aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) films epitaxially on flexible Hastelloy substrates through minimizing the lattice mismatch. The growth is predicted of c-plane and m-plane AZO on cubic buffers with lattice parameters of 3.94-4.63 Å and 5.20-5.60 Å, respectively. The ∼80 nm-thick m-plane AZO film has a resistivity of ∼11.43 ± 0.01 × 10-4 Ω cm, while the c-plane AZO film shows a resistivity of ∼2.68 ± 0.02 × 10-4 Ω cm comparable to commercial indium tin oxide films. An abnormally higher carrier concentration in the c-plane than in the m-plane AZO film results from the electrical polarity along the c-axis. The resistivity of the c-plane AZO film drops to the order of 10-5 Ω cm at 500 K owing to the semiconducting behaviour. Epitaxial AZO films with low resistivities and controllable orientations on flexible substrates offer optimal transparent electrodes and epitaxy seeds for high-performance flexible ZnO devices.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen bonds, aromatic stacking contacts and σ-hole interactions are all noncovalent interactions commonly observed in biological systems. Structural data derived from the Protein Data Bank showed that methionine residues can interact with oxygen atoms through directional S...O contacts in the protein core. In the present work, the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was used in conjunction with ab initio calculations to explore the σ-hole interaction properties of small-molecule compounds containing divalent sulfur. CSD surveys showed that 7095 structures contained R1-S-R2 groups that interact with electronegative atoms like N, O, S and Cl. Frequencies of occurrence and geometries of the interaction were dependent on the nature of R1 and R2, and the hybridization of carbon atoms in C,C-S, and C,S-S fragments. The most common interactions in terms of frequency of occurrence were C,C-S...O, C,C-S...N and C,C-S...S with predominance of Csp2. The strength of the chalcogen interaction increased when enhancing the electron-withdrawing character of the substituents. The most positive electrostatic potentials (VS,max; illustrating positive σ-holes) calculated on R1-S-R2 groups were located on the S atom, in the S-R1 and S-R2 extensions, and increased with electron-withdrawing R1 and R2 substituents like the interaction strength did. As with geometric data derived from the CSD, interaction geometries calculated for some model systems and representative CSD compounds suggested that the interactions were directed in the extensions of S-R1 and S-R2 bonds. The values of complexation energies supported attractive interactions between σ-hole bond donors and acceptors, enhanced by dispersion. The interactions of R1-S-R2 with large VS,max and nucleophiles with large negative VS,min coherently provided more negative energies. According to NBO analysis, chalcogen interactions consisted of charge transfer from a nucleophile lone pair to an S-R1 or S-R2 antibonding orbital. The directional σ-hole interactions at R1-S-R2 can be useful in crystal engineering and the area of supramolecular biochemistry.",

Increasing Fe content causes elongation in the octahedral units of the lattice, accompanied by distortion in the octahedral coordination.

Above ∼510 K, the cubic Fm 3 m δ-K 3 GaF 6 structure is stabilized, with a lattice parameter of a = 8.6649 (1) Å at 550 K.

In both salts, the TCNQF4 is reduced to the radical anion state, and is associated through short C-I...NC halogen bonds to two EDT-TTF-I2 molecules. The two polymorphs differ in the solid-state association of these trimeric D-A-D motifs. In polymorph (I) the trimeric motif is located on an inversion centre, and hence both EDT-TTF-I2 molecules have +0.5 charge. Together with segregation of the TTF and TCNQ derivatives into stacks, this leads to a charge-transfer salt with high conductivity. In polymorph (II) two crystallographically independent EDT-TTF-I2 molecules bear different charges, close to 0 and +1, as deduced from an established correlation between intramolecular bond lengths and charge. Overlap interactions between the halogen-bonded D(0)-A-∙D+∙ motifs give rise, in a perpendicular direction, to diamagnetic A2(2-) and D(0)-D2(2+)-D(0) entities, where the radical species are paired into the bonding combination of respectively the acceptor LUMOs and donor HOMOs. The strikingly different solid-state organization of the halogen-bonded D-A-D motifs provides an illustrative example of two modes of face-to-face interaction between π-type radicals, into either delocalized, uniform chains with partial charge transfer and conducting behaviour, or localized association of radicals into face-to-face A2(2-) and D2(2+) dyads.",

This melting-point difference is consistent with the molecular symmetry, as described by Carnelley's rule, and with the frequency of Br...Br halogen bonds. The lowest melting point of 1,3-dibromobenzene correlates with its two symmetry-independent molecules, indicating their inability to pack closely. Single crystals of 1,2- and 1,3-dibromobenzene have been grown under isochoric conditions in a diamond-anvil cell and at isobaric conditions in a glass capillary. Their structures have been determined in situ by X-ray diffraction. At 295 K 1,2-dibromobenzene crystallizes at 0.2 GPa as orthorhombic, space group Pbca, Z' = 1, and 1,3-dibromobenzene at 0.3 GPa as orthorhombic, space group P212121, Z' = 2. The same crystal phases are formed at ambient pressure by freezing these liquids below 256.15 and 248.45 K, respectively.

The single-crystal X-ray diffraction pattern consists of a difficult-to-disentangle mix of Bragg diffraction superimposed on rods of diffuse scattering which impede the estimation of accurate Bragg intensities. Two average monoclinic structure models with the same unit-cell dimensions, but different extents of disorder in the layers and different space groups seem plausible, one with the non-conventional space group setting B2(1)/g (No. 14, Z' = 2) and one in P2(1)/a (No. 14, Z' = 4). Disordered molecules related by a translation of 0.158b are present in all layers of the B2(1)/g model and in every second layer of the P2(1)/a model. Layer-to-layer contacts are practically the same in both models. According to order-disorder theory, both models are valid superposition structures. Structure-factor calculations show that the pattern of strong and weak Bragg reflections is very similar for the two models. R factors indicate that the B2(1)/g model is the most economic representation of the average structure. However, given the limitations in data processing, the P2(1)/a model should not be discarded and further insight sought from a detailed analysis of the experimental diffuse scattering. The difficulties encountered in this analysis raise the question of whether or not the concept of an average structure is applicable in practice to β-P.R. 170.",

Multiple linear regression models were fitted with the water OH bond length and bond angle as response variables. Other variables describing the position and nature of the acceptors and ions coordinated to the waters were taken as explanatory variables.

Accompanying density functional theory (DFT) calculations have yielded interaction energies and bond orders for the sulfur-metal interactions.",

The crystal structure, which in principle has 28 possible degrees of freedom, was determined in three stages by a combination of simulated annealing, partial Rietveld refinement with dummy atoms replacing the solvent molecules and further simulated annealing. The phase not being of commercial interest, additional experiments were not economically feasible and additional dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations were employed to confirm the correctness of the crystal structure. After the correctness of the structure had been ascertained, the bond lengths and valence angles from the DFT-D minimized crystal structure were fed back into the Rietveld refinement as geometrical restraints (`polymorph-dependent restraints') to further improve the details of the crystal structure; the positions of the H atoms were also taken from the DFT-D calculations. The final crystal structure is a layered structure with an elaborate network of hydrogen bonds.",

Iterative heating and cooling above and below 1155 K induce phase transitions between a low-temperature h.c.p. (hexagonal close packed) (6/m mm) and a high-temperature b.c.c. (body centred cubic) (m3m) structure. The crystallography of the two phases has been found to be related by the Burgers Orientation Relationship (Burgers OR). The transitions are accompanied by changes in texture, as an ever-increasing number of crystallographically equivalent variants occur with every cycle. Identifying their multiplicity is important to relate the textures before and after the transformation, in order to predict the resultant one and refine its microstructure. The four-dimensional Frank space was utilized to describe both h.c.p. and b.c.c. structures within the same orthogonal framework, and thus allow for their easy numerical manipulation through matrix algebra. Crystallographic group decomposition showed that the common symmetry maintained in both groups was that of group 2/m; therefore, the symmetry operations that generated the variants were of groups 3m and 23 for cubic and hexagonal generations, respectively. The number of all potential variants was determined for the first three variant generations, and degeneracy was indeed detected, reducing the number of variants from 72 to 57 and from 432 to 180 for the second and third generations, respectively. Degeneracy was attributed on some special alignments of symmetry operators, as a result of the Burgers OR connecting the relative orientation of the two structures.",

Layers of hydrophobic cations alternate with layers containing most of the anions and solvent molecules. All nine cations have the same basic conformation, which is distorted by the presence of the methyl substituents on the two 1,10-phenanthroline ligands. Four pairs of enantiomeric cations within a layer are related by approximate inversion centers; the ninth cation, which shows no sign of disorder, makes the layer chiral. Within the cation layers stripes parallel to [110] of six cations alternate with stripes of three; the local symmetry and the cation orientations are different in the two stripes. These stripes are reflected in the organization of the anion/solvent layer. The ca 80:20 inversion twinning found indicates that enantiomeric preference is transmitted less perfectly across the anion/solvent layer than within the cation layer.

The Rietveld refinement reduced χ 2 and overall R ( F 2 ) values are 1.840 and 0.0647, respectively. The sample, with the general garnet formula [8] X 3 [6] Y 2 [4] Z 3 [4] O 12 , contains an intergrowth of two cubic phases that occur initially as oscillatory growth zoning, and patchy intergrowths arise later from fluid-enhanced dissolution and re-precipitation. The two compositions obtained with electron-probe microanalyses (EPMA) are Ca 3.00 (Zr 1.31 Ti 4+ 0.46 Fe 3+ 0.22 Mn 3+ 0.01 ) ∑2 [Al 0.76 Fe 3+ 1.01 Si 1.23 ] ∑3 O 12 for phase 1 a and Ca 2.99 (Zr 1.48 Ti 4+ 0.37 Fe 3+ 0.15 ) ∑2 [Al 0.87 Fe 3+ 0.98 Si 1.15 ] ∑3 O 12 for phase 1 b .

    "abstract": "Due to their optical, photo-luminescence (PL), and afterglow properties, barium titanosilicates are compounds of great interest for functional materials and light-emitting devices. Among them, BaTiSi2O7 (BTS2) is certainly one of the most intriguing; it displays peculiar properties (e.g. PL orange emission) whose exhaustive explanation has been hampered to date by the lack of a structure model. In this work, BTS2 and the related compound BaTiSi4O11 (BTS4) were synthesized through conventional solid-state reaction methods. BTS2 invariably shows complex twinning patterns. Thus, its structure solution and Rietveld structure refinement were attempted using synchrotron powder diffraction. BTS2 was found to be an intergrowth of monoclinic and triclinic crystals. The monoclinic phase has the space group P21/n and unit cell a = 7.9836 (3), b = 10.0084 (4), c = 7.4795 (3) Å, and β = 100.321 (3)º, whereas the triclinic phase has the space group and unit cell a = 7.99385 (4), b = 10.01017 (5), c = 7.47514 (3) Å, α = 90.084 (8), β = 100.368 (8) and γ = 89.937 (9)º. These lattices can be seen as a distortion of that of tetragonal synthetic β-BaVSi2O7 with Ti in place of V. The structure models obtained from this study confirm the presence of fivefold coordinated Ti atoms in a distorted pyramidal configuration. The proposed solution supports existing theories for the explanation of the PL orange colour in BTS2.",

LiNaSO4 is pyroelectric, nonferroelectric and an optically uniaxial insulator which crystallizes in the space group P31c. Least-squares refinement (MOLLY) was based on 13,026 reflections. The asymmetric unit contains Li(+), Na(+) and three SO4(2-) ions, where one O and S lie on a threefold axis about which three O atoms are related with a threefold symmetry in each sulfate ion. Two of the O-S-O groups suffer from disorder. The net charges of the atoms in three independent sulfate ions were determined under ionic charge constraints. The S atoms have positive net electric charges and O atoms are negative. The components of the significant electric multipole moments in the principal axis directions are determined from the distribution of net atomic charges in each sulfate ion. Electric moments in the unit cell generate macroscopic electric moments in the crystal which interact with light. This interaction results in two axial vectors of second rank associated with an optical indicatrix. The ratio of the calculated axial vector components in the principal axis directions originating from the asymmetric unit is 1.0061 (1), which compares well with the ratio of 1.006 for the corresponding optical refractive indices of LiNaSO4 for λ(Na) = 589.29 nm.",

    "abstract": "The M2O-Al2O3-WO3 (M = alkaline metals) system has attracted the attention of the scientific community because some of its members showed potential applications as single crystalline media for tunable solid-state lasers. These materials behave as promising laser host materials due to their high and continuous transparency in the wide range of the near-IR region. A systematic investigation of these phases is nonetheless hampered because it is impossible to produce large crystals and only in a few cases a pure synthetic product can be achieved. Despite substantial advances in X-ray powder diffraction methods, structure investigation on nanoscale is still challenging, especially when the sample is polycrystalline and the structures are affected by pseudo-symmetry. Electron diffraction has the advantage of collecting data from single nanoscopic crystals, but it is frequently limited by incompleteness and dynamical effects. Automated diffraction tomography (ADT) recently emerged as an alternative approach able to collect more complete three-dimensional electron diffraction data and at the same time to significantly reduce dynamical scattering. ADT data have been shown to be suitable for ab initio structure solution of phases with large cell parameters, and for detecting pseudo-symmetry that was undetected in X-ray powder data. In this work we present the structure investigation of two hitherto undetermined compounds, K5Al(W3O11)2 and NaAl(WO4)2, by a combination of electron diffraction tomography and precession electron diffraction. We also stress how electron diffraction tomography can be used to obtain direct information about symmetry and pseudo-symmetry for nanocrystalline phases, even when available only in polyphasic mixtures.",

Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) is an effective building block used in the construction of promising functional materials. The parallel packing of the neutral TTF–TTF system was studied previously using the high-level quantum chemical method, advancing it as a valuable model system. The recently developed tight-binding quantum chemical method GFN2-xTB and local coupled-cluster method DLPNO-CCSD(T) were used to investigate the stacking interactions of TTF and selected derivatives deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database. Using the interaction energy of the TTF–TTF dimer calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level as the reference, the accuracies of the two methods are investigated. The energy decomposition analysis within the DLPNO-CCSD(T) framework reveals the importance of dispersion interaction in the TTF-related stacking systems. The dispersion interaction density plot vividly shows the magnitude and distribution of the dispersion interaction, providing a revealing insight into the stacking interactions in crystal structures. The results show that the GFN2-xTB and DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods could achieve accuracy at an affordable computational cost, which would be valuable in understanding the nature of parallel stacking in supramolecular systems.",

The three-dimensional thermal expansions of these polycrystalline powder samples were measured by in situ synchrotron powder diffraction from 25°C to 1600°C in air, nearly 600°C higher than other in situ thermal expansion studies. The high temperatures in synchrotron experiments were achieved with a quadrupole lamp furnace. Neutron powder diffraction measured the monoclinic phases from 25°C to 1150°C. The La 2 Ti 2 O 7 member of the rare earth di-titanates undergoes a monoclinic to orthorhombic displacive transition on heating, as shown by synchrotron diffraction in air at 885°C (864°C–904°C) and neutron diffraction at 874°C (841°C–894°C).",

The salamo-based ligand [ R -CH=N—O—(CH 2 ) n —O—N=CH— R ] is a new type of salen-based analog.

Complex (3) crystallizes in monoclinic space group Cc and consists of two Cu II cations, one incompletely deprotonated ligand (H L ) 2− unit and one coordinated ethanol molecule, and forms a novel homo-binuclear Cu II complex structure due to Br − counter anions. Complexes (1)–(3) have zero-dimensional cluster-based structures and are further assembled into three-dimensional frameworks via intermolecular interactions. Because of the different solvents and counter anions which have a significant influence on the structures of complexes (1)–(3), the interactions were quantitatively evaluated by Hirshfeld surfaces analyses. Complexes (1)–(3) have been characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectra, UV–vis spectra and X-ray crystallography analyses. In addition, fluorescence properties are evaluated and DFT calculations are performed.",

    "abstract": "The synergy between theory and experiment found in X-ray wavefunction refinement (XWR) makes it one of the most compelling techniques available for chemical physics. The foremost benefit of XWR – obtaining wavefunctions constrained to experimental data – is at the same time its Achilles heel, because of the dependence of the results on the quality of both empirical and theoretical data. The purpose of this work is to answer the following: What is the effect of the refinement strategy and manipulation of input data on the physical properties obtained from XWR? With that in mind, cutoffs based on data resolution and F /σ( F ) ratios were applied for both steps of XWR, the Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) and the X-ray constrained wavefunction fitting (XCW), for four selected systems: sulfur dioxide, urea, carbamazepine and oxalic acid. The effects of changing the weighting scheme or the method to transform σ( F 2 ) to σ( F ) were also analysed. The results show that while HAR always reaches the same result, XCW is extremely sensitive to crystallographic data manipulation. This is a result of the variability of the experimental uncertainties for different resolution shells, and of not having proper standard uncertainties. Therefore, the use of distinct constraints for each resolution interval in XCW is proposed to fix this instability.",

According to a previously reported investigation [Malpicci et al. (2021). Inorg. Chem. Front. 8 , 1312–1323], Ag I CPs showed both fluorescence and multiple ligand-centred room-temperature phosphorescences, whereas Cu I CPs displayed non-thermally equilibrated halogen and metal-to-ligand charge transfer and two ligand-centred phosphorescences, the latter observed only by their selective activation. Analysis of both local and integral QTAIM descriptors, including delocalization indices and source function, of the Ag—N and Cu—N bonds reveals a higher covalent and local character for the latter, explaining the greater metal–ligand electronic communication observed for the Cu compounds. Moreover, IQA investigation shows that the Cu—N bond is characterized by higher interaction energy, due to both higher electrostatic and exchange-correlation contributions. Analysis on the M — X ( M = Ag, Cu; X = I, Cl) bonds, also present in these structures, highlights a much higher covalent and local character with respect to the M —N bonds.",

The set of amino acids involved in Co II binding is similar to that observed for catalytic Zn II sites, i.e. with a large fraction of carboxylate O atoms from aspartate and glutamate and aromatic N atoms from histidine. The computed Co II –donor bond lengths were found to depend strongly on structure resolution, an artifact previously detected for other metal–donor distances. Small corrections are suggested for the target bond lengths to the aromatic N atoms of histidines and the O atoms of water and hydroxide. The available target distance for cysteine (Scys) is confirmed; those for backbone O and other donors remain uncertain and should be handled with caution in refinement and modeling protocols.

One phase shows monoclinic symmetry, Cc, while the other is orthorhombic Pmc21. The structures may be considered as two different modes of superstructure ordering of an underlying, disordered structure. Considered in the same metrically orthorhombic unit cell a = 37.8883, b = 4.7233, c = 11.6835 Å, the two can be conveniently distinguished by their non-standard centering, Cc being represented as Xc with the centering vectors (0 0 0); (½ 0 ½); (¼ ½ ¾); (¾ ½ ¼); and Pmc21 as Xmc21 with the centering vectors (0 0 0); (½ 0 0). The difference between the allotwin domains lies only in the relationship between next-nearest neighbors along the stacking direction 100 and hence the conformations and packing efficiencies are identical for both phases and all three domains. The stacking sequences for the two phases correspond to ABAB for the orthorhombic stacking and ABA'B'/AB'A'B for the two (equivalent) monoclinic stackings. The monoclinic phase dominates comprising ca 80% of the total volume. Within the monoclinic phase, the ratio between the two possible orientations is highly unbalanced (6:1) indicating relatively large domains. The allotwinning detected in this sample may appear exotic in molecular compounds, but we suggest that the rarity of such examples in the literature is a reflection of the paucity of software that can identify and handle such cases. It is easy to overlook the possibility that a complex diffraction pattern originates from allotwinning and assume that normal mono-component twinning is the cause. The underlying mechanism in this case is the formation of two-dimensional layers of molecules that allow for two equivalent, but in terms of absolute geometry, different, ways of stacking.",

The experimentally measured crystal lattice energies (ΔH(0)sub) decrease in the order: CH3 > F > CF3. The calculated lattice energies using the PIXEL approach are in good agreement with the experimental values, and the partitioned intermolecular interaction energies suggest that dispersion contributions dominate the crystal structures of all three compounds.

The ELF analysis confirms the idea that the O atom, in the linear geometry of (H3C)3-Si-O-Si-(CH3)3, is isolobal with the isoelectronic -CH3(+)- and -BH3- groups, the bonding in the Si-O-Si group being described as a two-electron, three-center (2e, 3c) bond. At the same time, the three oxygen lone pairs mirror the three C-H and B-H bonds, respectively. On the contrary, in the angular geometry the same O atoms form two Si-O bonds and its lone pairs mimic the geometry of the -CH2- group. In this model the O atoms would play the same role as the formally present O(2-) anions in the `so-called' ionic solids, such as in the skeletons of aluminate and silicate polyanions, thereby connecting molecular and solid-state chemistry as formulated by the `fragment formalism' or the `molecular unit-cell approach'. This unifying concept as well as the calculations we have carried out fully agree and also give support to earlier ideas developed by Bragg and Bent, among other authors. Bonding in the series of compounds P4, P4O6, P4O10, N4(CH2)6 (hexamethylenetetramine) and (CH)4(CH2)6 (adamantane) is discussed in the context of the isolobal model.",

These illustrate how the MIL-53 structure is able to distort to accommodate the bulk of the various substituents on the pyridine ring. The bulkiest pendant ligand, 4-phenylpyridine- N -oxide, results in a distortion of the diamond-shaped channels in an opposite sense to that seen previously in expanded forms of the parent MIL-53 structure. By comparison with published crystal structures for MIL-53 with various occluded guests, the structural distortions that take place to accommodate the pendant ligands are quantified and it is shown how a twisting of the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate ligand, instead of a hinging about the μ 2 -carboxylate-metal connection, allows the new structures that are observed.",

The Ge [6] atoms together with the NH 4 + groups act as true cations, transferring their 6 valence electrons to the acceptor Ge 2 O 5 moiety, so converting it into the [Ge 6 O 15 ] 6− [triple-bond]3(Ψ-As 2 O 5 ) ion (where Ψ refers to a pseudo-lattice) and yielding threefold connectivity.

(2009). Acta Cryst. B 65 , 11–21] as well as the compound FeLiPO 4 [Vegas (2011). Struct. Bond. 138 , 67–91]. This new insight conforms well to previous (differential thermal analysis) DTA–TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) experiments [Cascales et al. (1998). Angew. Chem. Int. Ed . 37 , 129–131], which show endothermic loss of NH 3 and H 2 O to give rise to the metastable structure Ge 7 O 14 , which further collapses to the rutile-type GeO 2 structure. We analyze the stability change in terms of ionic strength, I , and so provide a means of rationalizing the driving force behind this concept capable of explaining the atomic arrangements found in these types of crystal structures. Although the concept was formulated in 2003, later than the publication of the germanate structure, it was not used or else ignored by colleagues who solved this crystal structure.",

The doping of the samples allowed us to obtain two polymorphic forms, α and β, of LiNH 4 SO 4 (LAS). By means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) in single crystals, we determined the crystal structures of two new α-polytypes, which we have named α 1 - and α 2 -LAS. They present the same space group P 2 1 / c and the following relation among their lattice parameters: a 2 = − c 1 , b 2 = − b 1 , c 2 = −2 a 1 − c 1 . In order to evaluate the stability of the new α-polytypes, we performed thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction and dielectric spectroscopy on single crystals and polycrystalline samples over the cyclic temperature range: 190 → 575 → 190 K. The results obtained by all the techniques used in this study demonstrate that α-polytypes are stable across a wide range of temperatures and they show an irreversible phase transition to the paraelectric β-phase above 500 K. In addition, a comparative study of α- and β-polytypes shows that both polymorphic structures have a common axis, with a possible intergrowth that facilitates their coexistence and promotes the reconstructive α → β transition. This intergrowth was related to small anomalies detected between 240 and 260 K, in crystals with an α-habit.",

At room temperature, 2A3NP-HS crystallizes as a non-centrosymmetric disordered phase (I) in the orthorhombic Pna21 space group. On cooling below 298 K, 2A3NP-HS undergoes a reversible phase transition to phase (II) with the monoclinic non-centrosymmetric P21 space group. This transition might be classified as an `order-disorder' type. The structural details in both phases are analysed. Additionally, for phase (I), in the 304-365 K temperature range, diffuse scattering was found to be present in the form of elongated streaks parallel to the a* direction. This can be unravelled when implementing a short-range order affecting anionic cationic ribbons occurring in the structure, with correlations acting both in the a-direction and in the bc-plane. The results of Monte Carlo simulations, adapting a two-dimensional Ising-type model, reveal the formation of domains, which are b-elongated and thin along a. Locally, the stacking of the ribbons in the domains reflects the ordered arrangement observed in the low-temperature monoclinic phase (II).",

    "abstract": "The ability to intentionally construct, through different types of interactions, inorganic-organic hybrid materials with desired properties is the main goal of inorganic crystal engineering. The primary deformation, related to intrinsic interactions within inorganic substructure, and the secondary deformation, mainly caused by the hydrogen bond interactions, are both responsible for polyhedral distortions of halogenidoantimonates(III) with organic cations. The evolution of structural parameters, in particular the Sb-I secondary- and O/N/C-H...I hydrogen bonds, as a function of temperature assists in understanding the contribution of those two distortion factors to the irregularity of [SbI6]3- polyhedra. In tris(piperazine-1,4-diium) bis[hexaiodidoantimonate(III)] pentahydrate, (C4H12N2)3[SbI6]2·5H2O (TPBHP), where the isolated [SbI6]3- units were found, distortion is governed only by O/N/C-H...I hydrogen bonds, whereas in piperazine-1,4-diium bis[tetraiodidoantimonate(III)] tetrahydrate, (C4H12N2)[SbI4]2·4H2O (PBTT), both primary and O-H...I secondary factors cause the deformation of one-dimensional [{SbI4}n]n- chains. The larger in spatial dimensions piperazine-1,4-diium cations, in contrast to the smaller water of crystallization molecules, do not significantly contribute to the octahedral distortion, especially in PBTT. The formation of isolated [SbI6]3- ions in TPBHP is the result of specific second coordination sphere hydrogen bond interactions that stabilize the hybrid structure and simultaneously effectively separate and prevent [SbI6]3- units from mutual interactions. The temperature-induced changes, further supported by the analysis of data retrieved from the Cambridge Structural Database, illustrate the significance of both primary and secondary distortion factors on the deformation of octahedra. Also, a comparison of packing features in the studied hybrids with those in the non-metal containing piperazine-1,4-diium diiodide diiodine (C4H12N2)I2·I2 (PDD) confirms the importance and hierarchy of different types of interactions.",

The observed phase transitions were confirmed to be reversible first-order transitions as indicated by the sharp endothermic and exothermic peaks in the differential scanning calorimetry measurement. The three-molecule aggregate of HBA and HMBA consists of a hexamethylenetetramine molecule and two benzoic acid or two 4-methylbenzoic acid molecules, respectively. The acid molecules are ordered at the low-temperature phase and are equally disordered over two positions, which are related by a mirror symmetry, at the high-temperature phase. The two-dimensional supramolecular constructs common to both co-crystals are formed by three-molecule aggregates via weak intermolecular C—H...O and C—H...π interactions into molecular trilayers parallel to the ac plane with small XPac dissimilarity indices and parameters. The PIXEL interaction energies of all corresponding molecular contacts were calculated and the results are comparable between HBA and HMBA co-crystals, resulting in similar lattice energies and transition temperatures despite their two-dimensional isostructural relationship. The observed phase transitions of these two energetically similar co-crystals are triggered by similar mechanisms, i.e. the molecular rotator ordering and structural order–disorder transformation, which induced non-merohedral twinning with similar twin matrices in the low-temperature crystal form of both co-crystals.",

    "abstract": "The ditopic organic molecule 3-(pyridin-4-yl)acetylacetone (HacacPy) acts as a pyridine-type ligand towards HgX2 (X = Cl, Br, I). The nature of the anion and the ligand-to-cation ratio dominate the outcome of the reaction. Two different coordination compounds form with HgCl2, namely a ligand-rich mononuclear complex, HgCl2(HacacPy)2, and a ligand-deficient one-dimensional chain polymer, [Hg(μ-Cl)2(HacacPy)]1∞, with five-coordinated HgII cations. Two compounds are also observed for HgBr2, a molecular complex isomorphous to the chloride derivative and a chain polymer with the composition [Hg(μ-Br)Br(HacacPy)]1∞, in which the cations are four-coordinated. The ligand-rich mononuclear and ligand-deficient polymeric chloride and bromide complexes may be interconverted via thermal degradation and mechanochemical synthesis. In contrast to the chloride and bromide compounds, the reaction product with HgI2 does not depend on the ligand-to-cation ratio but corresponds to [Hg(μ-I)I(HacacPy)]1∞, isomorphous to the bromide derivative. The N-coordinated HacacPy complexes could not be deprotonated and further crosslinked with a second cation. Synthesis of mixed-metal products could be achieved, however, by deprotonation of the acetylacetone moiety in HacacPy and formation of tris-chelated Fe(acacPy)3 and Al(acacPy)3 complexes in the first step. These mononuclear building blocks act as bridging poly(pyridine) ligands towards HgII halides and form two structure types. The first represents a one-dimensional ladder, with the tris(ligand) complexes acting as triconnected nodes and the HgII halides acting as linkers. In the alternative unprecedented product, both the tris(ligand) complexes and the [HgX2(μ-X)HgX] groups act as equivalent triconnected nodes. They form a uninodal two-dimensional coordination network with vertex symbol 4.82 and fes topology.",

Understanding the solid-state supramolecular structure is crucial for predicting the properties and biological activity of the material. Several crystalline phases of DMSO-coordinated iridium anions with different cations, potassium (1 a ) and n -butylammonium (1 b ), were obtained and their structures determined by X-ray crystallography. Compound (1 a ) is present in two solvatomorphic forms: α and β; the β form contains disordered solvent water. In addition, the structures exhibit different rotamers of the trans -[IrCl 4 (DMSO) 2 ] − anion with the trans -DMSO ligands being oriented in anti and gauche conformations. In consideration of these various conformers, the effects of the crystallized solvent and intermolecular interactions on the conformational preferences of the anion are discussed. In addition, density functional theory calculations were used to investigate the energies of the anions in the different conformations. It was found that hydrogen bonds between water and the DMSO complex stabilize the gauche conformation which is the least stable form of the trans -DMSO complex. Consequently, by controlling the number of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors and the amount of water, it may be possible to obtain different solvatomorphs of clinically significant metallodrugs.",

Diffraction patterns of the α- and β-phases frequently show diffuse streaks parallel to c *, which indicates a stacking disorder of the layers. A symmetry analysis was carried out to derive possible stacking sequences. Lattice-energy minimizations by force fields and by dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) were performed on a set of ordered model structures with Z = 4, 8 and 16 with different stacking sequences. The calculated energies depend not only on the arrangement of neighbouring double layers, but also of next-neighbouring double layers. Stacking probabilities were calculated from the DFT-D energies. According to the calculated stacking probabilities large models containing 100 double layers were constructed. Their simulated diffraction patterns show sharp reflections for h + k = 2 n and diffuse streaks parallel to c * through all reflections with h + k = 2 n + 1. Experimental single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that at 173 K norleucine exists in the β-phase with stacking disorder.

Solid HacacPy exists as the enol tautomer with a short intramolecular hydrogen bond. At 100 K, its donor···acceptor distance is 2.450 (8) Å and the compound adopts space group C 2/ c , with the N and para -C atoms of the pyridyl ring and the central C of the acetylacetone substituent on the twofold crystallographic axis. As a consequence of the axial symmetry, the bridging hydrogen is disordered over two symmetrically equivalent positions, and the carbon–oxygen bond distances adopt intermediate values between single and double bonds. Upon cooling, a structural phase transition to the t 2 subgroup P \\bar 1 occurs; the resulting twins show an ordered acetylacetone moiety. The phase transition is fully reversible but associated with an appreciable hysteresis in the large single crystal under study: transition to the low-temperature phase requires several hours at 2.5 K and heating to 80 K is required to revert the transformation. No significant hysteresis is observed in a powder sample, in agreement with the second-order nature of the phase transition.",

Compound (I) can be described in terms of dinuclear [Eu2(H2O)4](6+) units bonded through mta(3-) ligands to form a two-dimensional framework with topology corresponding to a (6,3)-connected binodal (4(3))(4(6)6(6)8(3))-kgd net, where the dinuclear [Eu2(H2O)4](6+) units are considered as a single node. Compounds (II) and (III) have distinct three-dimensional topologies, namely a (4(12)6(3))(4(9)6(6))-nia net for (II) and a (4(10)6(5))(4(11)6(4))-K2O2; 36641 net for (III). The crystal density of (III) is greater than that of (II), consistent with the increase of temperature, and thereby autogeneous pressure, in the hydrothermal synthesis.",

    "abstract": "One century of modern crystallography, celebrated in this year, 2014, has brought about many developments, some of which have involved the use of 'non-ambient conditions', which in their most severe form can be described as 'extreme-conditions' crystallography.In addition to recognizing this increasingly vibrant research field, this special edition also represents a refocusing of Acta Crystallographica Section B to become the journal of choice when it comes to publishing high-quality results from non-ambient crystallographic studies.The first low-and high-temperature structural determinations were performed soon after the inception of X-ray diffraction structural analysis.One of the first lowtemperature determinations was the structure of benzene by Cox (1932).About the same time the first reports on high-pressure powder diffraction experiments were published by Cohen (1933).The high-pressure studies required strong elaborate equipment, and highpressure diffraction on single-crystal diffraction was carried out over 20 years later by Vereshchagin et al. (1958).Those high-pressure experiments yielded results of low precision due to the thick walls of the pressure vessels.In fact, the inception of X-ray diffraction methods coincided with considerable progress in high-pressure techniques developed by Percy W. Bridgman.At that time mainly piston and cylinder pressure chambers were used, or chambers pressurized by gas pumped through a capillary from an external pressure generator, as well as opposed-anvils (still called Bridgman anvils), belt or multi-anvil presses of various designs, all of considerable dimensions and weight and not suited for diffraction experiments.About that time, the first synthetic diamonds were made.Also in 1959, Jamieson et al. (1959) and independently Weir et al. (1959) invented the main device for high-pressure crystallography -the diamond-anvil cell (DAC).This simple but ingenious apparatus still continues today to break all records of pressure, exceeding that at the centre of the Earth (364 GPa).The DAC is relatively simple yet it allows precise high-pressure diffraction measurements under laboratory conditions.Soon after the DAC was later developed by the introduction of a metal gasket between the opposed anvils and by the invention of ruby-fluorescence and other spectroscopic methods for precisely calibrating pressure inside the tiny volume of the DAC chamber.The miniature DAC can now be mounted on any single-crystal diffractometer in a home laboratory, and thanks to area detectors high-pressure diffraction measurements can be run relatively easily.One of the first high-pressure structural determinations were those on chloroform by Fourme (1968) and on the high-pressure phase of benzene by Piermarini et al. (1969).High-pressure techniques are constantly being developed and presently laboratory X-ray diffraction studies can be complemented by spectroscopy, also on the same sample in the DAC, as well as by experiments in specialized large-facility stations at synchrotrons, and at neutron spallation and nuclear reactor sources (Katrusiak, 2008).Internally and externally heated DACs are available, as well as laser heating allowing temperatures well over 1000 C. Other types of high-pressure devices have also been developed for various specific purposes, including physical, chemical, biological and most of all materials studies.There the samples can be cooled (either in cryostats or in the stream of cold gas) or heated, and various types of measurements can be performed for the same specimen.But most importantly, high pressure can now be used in laboratories and is now routinely applied to freezing protein crystals before diffraction studies.Variable-temperature studies have benefitted for some decades now from the commercial availability of a number of sample chambers or environments.In many cases, particularly for powder diffraction studies, these utilize a metallic heating strip on which the sample is placed and is then heated electrically, or some kind of heated chamber in which the sample is contained.In reality, the gas cryostats now routinely used in single-",

Nanoindentation tests are consistent with excellent integration between coating and substrate. Structural similarities between the eutectic components within the coating, as well as between these and the substrate, are consistent with the crystallographic concepts proposed by Vegas (Ramos-Gallardo & Vegas, 1997), where cation sub-arrays play an important role governing metal oxide structures.

Mineral. 97, 1849-1857], has been re-examined with the aim of determining the nature of the superstructure noted in their study. The composition corresponds to a 1:1 combination of KMg2Si2O7H and K2Mg2Si2O7 end-members, but it is not a solid solution. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data for one of the original K1.5Mg2Si2O7H0.5 crystals synthesized at 16 GPa/1573 K, has been collected using a much longer exposure time in order to improve the intensity statistics of weak superlattice reflections identified by Welch et al. (2012). The superstructure has been determined using a superspace approach as having the superspace group Cmcm(0,β,0)00s and t0 = 1/16 with refined parameters a = 8.7623 (10), b = 5.0703 (7), c = 13.2505 (11) Å, V = 588.69 (12) Å3. This structure corresponds to one with the conventional space group Pbnm and unit-cell parameters a = 8.7623 (10), b = 20.281 (3), c = 13.2505 (11) Å, V = 2354.7 (5) Å3 and is based upon a super-sheet motif in which ordering involves rows of pairs of vacant interlayer K sites. This is the third topologically distinct structure type for the KMg2Si2O7H-K2Mg2Si2O7 join and suggests that there is very limited solid solution, and so it can be expected that each of the three structures (P63cm, P\\bar 3 1m and Pbnm) has its own stability field, rather than being part of a continuous compositional series based upon a single structure type. As such, K1.5Mg2Si2O7H0.5 should be considered as a potentially significant host of K in the Earth's mantle.",

NISac·py crystallizes in the monoclinic system (space group B 2 1 / e ). The unconventional setting of the space group is adopted (the conventional setting is P 2 1 / c , No. 14) to emphasise the strongly pseudo-orthorhombic symmetry of the lattice, with a β angle very close to 90°. The crystal structure contains one molecule each of N -iodosaccharin (NISac) and pyridine (py) in the asymmetric unit ( Z ′ = 1), linked via an N sac ...I...N′ py halogen-bonding motif. A gradual modification of this motif is observed under pressure as a result of changes in the crystalline environment. Mechanical twinning is observed under compression and the sample splits into two domains, spanning an unequal volume that is mapped by a twofold rotation about the [100] direction of the B 2 1 / e unit cell. The twinning is particularly significant at high pressure, being reversible when the pressure is released. The structure of the twinned sample reveals the continuity of a substantial substructure across the composition plane. The presence of this common substructure in the two orientations of the twinned individuals can be interpreted as a structural reason for the formation of the twin and is the first observed example in a molecular crystal. These results indicate that the anisotropy of intermolecular interactions in the crystal structure results in an anisotropic strain generated upon the action of hydrostatic compression. Periodic density functional theory calculations were carried out by considering an isotropic external pressure, the results showing good agreement with the experimental findings. The bulk modulus of the crystal was obtained from the equations of state, being 7 (1) GPa for experimental data and 6.8 (5) GPa for theoretical data.",

    "abstract": "Bond valence analysis has been applied to various copper chalcogenides with copper valence excess, i.e. where the formal valence of copper exceeds 1. This approach always reveals a copper bond valence excess relative to the unit value, correlated to an equivalent ligand bond valence deficit. In stoichiometric chalcogenides, this corresponds to one ligand electron in excess per formula unit relative to the valence equilibrium considering only CuI. This ligand electron in excess is 50/50 shared between all or part of the Cu-atom positions, and all or part of the ligand-atom positions. In Cu3Se2, only one of the two Cu positions is involved in this sharing. It would indicate a special type of multicentre bonding (`one-electron co-operative bonding'). Calculated and ideal structural formulae according to this bond valence distribution are presented. At the crystal structure scale, Cu-ligand bonds implying the single electron in excess form one-, two- or three-dimensional subnetworks. Bond valence distribution according to two two-dimensional subnets is detailed in covellite, CuS. This bond valence description is a formal crystal-chemical representation of the metallic conductivity of holes (mixing between Cu 3d bands and ligand p bands), according to published electronic band structures. Bond valence analysis is a useful and very simple prospective approach in the search for new compounds with targeted specific physical properties.",

B77, 861], we extend our analytic description of the regular cross sections of zincblende- and diamond-structure nanowires (NWires) by introducing cross section morphing to arbitrary convex shapes featuring linear interfaces as encountered in experiment. To this end, we provide add-on terms to the existing number series with their respective running indices for zinc-blende- (zb-) and diamond-structure NWire cross sections. Such add-on terms to all variables yield the required flexibility for cross section morphing, with main variables presented by the number of NWire atoms NWire(dWire[i]), bonds between NWire atoms Nbnd(dWire[i]) and interface bonds NIF(dWire[i]). Other basic geometric variables, such as the specific length of interface facets, as well as widths, heights and total area of the cross section, are given as well. The cross sections refer to the six high-symmetry zb NWires with low-index faceting frequently occurring in the bottom-up and top-down approaches of NWire processing. The fundamental insights into NWire structures revealed here offer a universal gauge and thus enable major advancements in data interpretation and the understanding of all zb- and diamond-structure-based NWires with arbitrary convex cross sections. We corroborate this statement with an exact description of irregular Si NWire cross sections and irregular InGaAs/GaAs core-shell NWire cross sections, where a radially changing unit-cell parameter can be included.",

    "abstract": "Single crystals of molybdenum-incorporated tris(thiourea)zinc(II) sulfate (MoZTS) are grown by the slow evaporation solution growth technique. Crystal composition as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that it belongs to the orthorhombic system with space group Pca21 and cell parameters a = 11.153 (2), b = 7.7691 (14), c = 15.408 (3) Å, V = 1335.14 (4) Å(3) and Z = 4. The surface morphological changes are studied by scanning electron microscopy. The vibrational patterns in FT-IR are used to identify the functional group and TGA/DTA (thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis) indicates the stability of the material. The structure and the crystallinity of the material were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction analysis and the simulated X-ray diffraction (XRD) closely matches the experimental one with varied intensity patterns. The band gap energy is estimated using diffuse reflectance data by the application of the Kubelka-Munk algorithm. The relative second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency measurements reveal that MoZTS has an efficiency comparable to that of tris(thiourea)zinc(II) sulfate (ZTS). Hirshfeld surfaces were derived using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Investigation of the intermolecular interactions and crystal packing via Hirshfeld surface analysis reveal that the close contacts are associated with strong interactions. Intermolecular interactions as revealed by the fingerprint plot and close packing could be the possible reasons for facile charge transfer leading to SHG activity.",

    "abstract": "Tranexamic acid (TNA) is an anti-fibrinolytic hemostatic drug widely used in various medical treatments. Six new salts and five cocrystals of TNA are reported here and the crystal structures of the obtained multicomponent compounds were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) techniques. TNA formed salts with coformers maleic acid (MEA), nicotinic acid, DL-mandelic acid and saccharin. Salt formation with MEA resulted in three different solid forms, namely TNA-MEA (1:1), TNA-MEA (2:1) and TNA-MEA-H2O (1:1:1). All synthesized TNA salt structures were crystallized as anhydrous except for TNA-MEA-H2O (1:1:1). TNA formed cocrystals with phenolic coformers such as catechol (CAT), resorcinol, hydroquinone, pyrogallol (PRG) and phloroglucinol. All cocrystal structures crystallized as hydrates except for TNA-PRG (1:1). The detailed structural investigation using SC-XRD revealed the presence of robust N-H...O and O-H...O hydrogen bonds in TNA salts and cocrystals. In TNA cocrystals, except for TNA-CAT-H2O (1:1:1), the coformer molecules interact with TNA molecules via bridged water molecules. In all the salt structures, TNA exists as cations, in which both carboxylic and amino groups are protonated (-COOH and -NH3+), while in cocrystals TNA exists as zwitterions with total charge zero. All synthesized multicomponent compounds were further characterized by differential scanning calorimetric, thermogravimetric and Fourier transform infrared analyses, and the formation of new multicomponent compounds were assessed based on the melting temperatures, percentage weight loss and stretching frequencies, respectively, corresponding to TNA/coformer molecules. A powder X-ray diffraction study confirmed the bulk purity of the synthesized crystalline multicomponent compounds.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the solvation and desolvation of pharmaceutical materials is an important part of materials discovery and development. In situ structural data are vital to understand the changes to crystal form that may occur in the system. In this study, the isolation and characterization of seven solvates of the L-type calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine, is described using variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction so that the structural evolution as a function of temperature can be followed. The solvates reported herein can be split into those that are structurally similar to the previously reported dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dioxane solvates and those that have a novel packing arrangement. Of particular note is the solvate with tetrahydrofuran (THF) which has a hydrogen-bonding motif between the nifedipine molecules very similar to that of metastable β-nifedipine. In addition to variable-temperature X-ray diffraction, the stability of the solid forms was assessed using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis and indicates that in all cases desolvation results in the thermodynamically stable α-polymorph of nifedipine even with the THF solvate. From the diffraction data the pathway of desolvation during heating of the DMF solvate showed conversion to another likely 1:1 polymorph before desolvation to α-nifedipine. The desolvation of this material indicated a two-stage process; first the initial loss of 90% of the solvent before the last 10% is lost on melting. The methanol solvate shows interesting negative thermal expansion on heating, which is rarely reported in organic materials, but this behaviour can be linked back to the winerack-type hydrogen-bonding pattern of the nifedipine molecules.",

Different types of hydrogen bonding are discussed within the framework of the method of visualization and molecular Voronoi–Dirichlet polyhedra. Good correlations are found between calculated and experimental data for several cases, such as the agreement between π stacking and polymorphic transition temperatures as well as between the area of a contact and the energy of conjugation.

    "abstract": "This paper reports an investigation of the chemistry, crystal structure refinement and thermal behavior (80–1650 K) of ludwigite from the Iten'yurginskoe deposit (Eastern Chukotka, Russia). Its chemical composition was determined by electron microprobe analysis, giving an empirical formula (Mg 1.70 Fe 2+ 0.29 Mn 0.01 ) Σ2.00 (Fe 3+ 0.90 Al 0.08 Mg 0.02 ) Σ1.00 O 2 (BO 3 ). A refinement of the crystal structure from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data (SCXRD) was provided for the first time for ludwigite from this deposit ( R = 0.047). The structure can be described as a framework composed of [ M O 6 ] n − octahedra and isolated [BO 3 ] 3− triangles located in triangular interstices of the framework. Based on a comprehensive analysis of SCXRD and Mössbauer spectroscopy data, the M 1 site is occupied by Mg, M 2 and M 3 by Mg and Fe 2+ , M 4 by Fe 3+ , Mg and Al. There are also oxo-centered [O4 M 4 ] n + and [O2 M 5 ] n + polyhedra building up a framework with the [BO 3 ] 3− triangles located in its hexagonal interstices. No indications of magnetic ordering are found in the temperature range investigated. The Fe 2+ → Fe 3+ oxidation occurs above 600 K, and is accompanied by a decrease of the unit-cell parameters and subsequent incomplete solid-phase decomposition with the formation of hematite, warwickite and magnetite. The mineral melts at temperatures above 1582 K. The thermal expansion of ludwigite is slightly anisotropic, which is explained by a dense packing of the [ M O 6 ] n − octahedra as well as a virtually perpendicular orientation of the oxo-centered double chains to each other. At room temperature, maximum expansion is along the c axis (α c = 9.1 × 10 −6 K −1 ) and minimum expansion is in the ab plane (α a = 8.6 × 10 −6 , α b = 7.6 × 10 −6 K −1 ), which is due to the preferred orientation of the [BO 3 ] 3− triangles. A comparison of the thermal behavior of three oxoborates of the ludwigite group, namely azoproite (Mg,Fe 2+ ) 2 (Fe 3+ ,Ti,Mg,Al)O 2 (BO 3 ), vonsenite (Fe 2+ ,Mg) 2 (Fe 3+ ,Mn 2+ ,Sn,Al)O 2 (BO 3 ) and ludwigite (Mg , Fe 2+ , Mn) 2 (Fe 3+ , Al , Mg)O 2 (BO 3 ), is provided.",

    "abstract": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients is a key technique in the confirmation of molecular connectivity, including absolute stereochemistry, as well as the solid-state form. However, accessing single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient can be experimentally laborious, especially considering the potential for multiple solid-state forms (solvates, hydrates and polymorphs). In recent years, methods for the exploration of experimental crystallization space of small molecules have undergone a `step-change', resulting in new high-throughput techniques becoming available. Here, the application of high-throughput encapsulated nanodroplet crystallization to a series of six dihydropyridines, calcium channel blockers used in the treatment of hypertension related diseases, is described. This approach allowed 288 individual crystallization experiments to be performed in parallel on each molecule, resulting in rapid access to crystals and subsequent crystal structures for all six dihydropyridines, as well as revealing a new solvate polymorph of nifedipine (1,4-dioxane solvate) and the first known solvate of nimodipine (DMSO solvate). This work further demonstrates the power of modern high-throughput crystallization methods in the exploration of the solid-state landscape of active pharmaceutical ingredients to facilitate crystal form discovery and structural analysis by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",

The compound undergoes a first-order reversible phase transition at Theat = 318.0 (1) K, Tcool = 300.0 (1) K, as assessed by the coexistence of both phases in the vicinity of the transition and the abrupt changes observed in the unit-cell parameters with temperature. The process is accompanied by clear thermosalient behaviour, with a conspicuous movement of the samples. On cooling, the transformation leads from a P212121 symmetry (Z' = 1) to P21, with an abrupt change in β [90 ↔ 94.78 (1)°] and duplication of the asymmetric unit contents (Z' = 2). The main structural differences observed across the transition are extremely small, with almost no changes in the stronger, non-covalent interaction scheme involving the `conventional' (N-H...Cl, O-H...Cl) hydrogen bonds.",

Polymorphic modifications of fluoro- and bromo-substituted 2-(N-arylimino)coumarin-3-carboxamides belong to different crystal types mainly due to different arrangement of basic structural motifs separated out using quantum chemical calculations.",

The crystal structure was solved using a single-crystal experiment and the purity of the bulk material was proved by the Rietveld method. This borate crystallizes in the monoclinic C 2/ c space group with unit-cell parameters a = 7.2386 (3), b = 9.3412 (5), c = 11.1013 (4) Å and β = 103.2240 (10)°. IR and Raman spectroscopic analyses confirmed the monoclinic structure of SmAl 3 (BO 3 ) 4 . Under 532.1 nm excitation, luminescence spectra exhibit bands assignable to the transitions from 4 G 5/2 to 6 H 5/2 , 6 H 7/2 , 6 H 9/2 and 6 H 11/2 . The similarity of the luminescence spectra of the trigonal and monoclinic polymorphs is explained by the minor role of Sm—O bond distortion and the primary role of rotational distortion of SmO 6 octahedra. The smaller covalency of the Sm—O bond in alumoborates is deduced in comparison with galloborates. Calorimetric measurements did not reveal high-temperature structural phase transitions up to a temperature of 720 K.",

Altering the concentration of piperazine (pip, ancillary ligand) enables control over the dimensionality of the compound by switching between the 0D [H 2 pip][Hpip][Pr(pydc) 3 ]·4H 2 O ( I ) and the 1D {[Pr(pydc)(Hpydc)(H 2 O) 2 ]·4H 2 O} n ( II ) coordination polymer (CP).

Compound IV shows high stability in the absence of uncoordinated solvent molecules and is stable up to 400°C, even in the presence of humidity. Therefore, IV was utilized for iodine adsorption in the vapour phase and in the presence of humidity. The results confirm the remarkable potential of IV for reversible adsorption of iodine vapour.",

The asymmetric unit of the complex comprises an octahedral coordination for the Ni II with two L-tyrosine-based ligands, a water molecule and one O atom of the carbonate bridge. The Ni 3 –μ 3 -CO 3 core in this compound is the first reported of this kind according to the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). The supramolecular structure is mainly sustained by hydrogen bonds developed by the phenolic functionality of the L-tyrosine moiety of one ligand and the carboxylate group of a neighbouring ligand. The crystal packing is then characterized by three interpenetrated supramolecular helices associated with a diastereoisomer of the type R - sup P , which is essential for the assembly process. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization data support weak ferromagnetic exchange interactions within the novel Ni 3 –μ 3 -CO 3 core. The Ni II complex obtained under the same synthetic conditions but using the analogous ligand derived from the amino acid L-phenylalanine instead of L-tyrosine gives rise to to a mononuclear octahedral system. The results obtained for the different complexes demonstrate the role of the supramolecular structure regarding the CO 2 uptake property for these Ni II –amino-acid-based systems.",

Trends in the unit-cell dimensions and yet unreported trends in other structural properties (interatomic distances and the fractional occupation of three Ca/RE sites) for these compounds are demonstrated as a function of RE ionic radius. The unit-cell volume and a unit-cell parameter present a linear dependence, while the b and c unit-cell parameters change in a nonlinear manner. For the whole series, the RE atoms are present at all three cationic sites (labelled as M 1, M 2 and M 3), but the fractional occupancies depend on the RE ionic radius. The small rare-earth atoms tend to enter mainly the M 3 site; for the larger rare earths, the occupancy of this site decreases sharply. The occupancy of the M 1 site by RE atoms is around 0.5 and tends to increase with increasing RE ionic radius. The M 2 site is the least preferentially occupied by RE ions, but the occupancy discernibly increases with rising radius as well. These findings are assembled with properties of isostructural strontium and barium borates, allowing prediction of occupancy schemes for not yet investigated compounds from the A 3 RE 2 (BO 3 ) 4 ( A = Ca, Ba, Sr).",

Single-crystal X-ray analysis shows that the molecule possesses both Sb···S and C-H···S interactions, which results in a supramolecular association in the absence of hydrogen-bonding functionality on the R group. The co-existence in the title compound of such interactions is a unique character of known dimeric antimony(III) alkyl and/or aryl dithiocarbamate complexes. The literature reveals that the species where the alkyl and/or aryl dithiocarbamates carry the following groups: R = methyl (chloroform solvated), ethyl, n-propyl, pyrrolidine, morpholine, piperidine, azepane, benzyl, methylphenyl, are not capable of forming significant hydrogen-bonding interactions. However, either Sb···S or C-H···S intermolecular interactions dominate between two centrosymmetrically related molecules leading to a supramolecular aggregation. In the species where the R group carries hydrogen-bonding functionality, i.e. 2-hydroxylethyl, the C-H···S interactions are subverted by O-H···O hydrogen bonding. In addition, the title compound does not have steric hindrance or any hydrogen-bonding group but is stabilized with the co-existence of Sb···S and C-H···S interactions. Analysis of the secondary interactions of a series of analogues previously reported reveals that steric bulk is unnecessary for the mitigation of Sb···S interactions and for the establishment of C-H···S secondary bonding.",

After isothermal heating at 1273 K for around 28 h, a single-phase α-cordierite (high-temperature hexagonal polymorph) was synthesized. All materials were investigated using X-ray powder diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The crystal structure and microstructure were determined from X-ray diffraction patterns. Rietveld refinement confirmed the formation of magnesium-cobalt cordierite solid solutions. The unit-cell volume increased with the increase of cobalt content in the starting glass. The crystalline microstructure of the cordierites was interpreted using a mathematical model of a polycrystalline material and characterized by prevalent crystallite shape, volume-weighted crystallite size distribution and second-order crystalline lattice-strain distribution. Hexagonal prismatic was the prevalent shape of α-cordierite crystallites. Bimodality in the size distribution was observed and interpreted as a consequence of two paths of the crystallization: the nucleation from glass of μ-cordierite, which transformed into α-cordierite with annealing, or the nucleation of α-cordierite directly from glass at high temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy images agreed well with crystalline microstructure characteristics determined from the X-ray diffraction line-profile analysis.",

To optimize the positions of the 64 atoms in the monoclinic computational cell the PBESOL and hybrid PBE0 functionals were used. The crystal structure of the title compound, which is liquid at room temperature, is built of antiparallel pairs of molecules assembled into molecular columns stacked along the a axis. Dominating the crystal-building forces are weak intermolecular dispersion interactions. Bonding conditions in the structure were analysed by theoretical molecular calculations of representative next-neighbor molecular dimers carried out using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) functionals and the SCS-MP2 wavefunction method. The largest interaction energy is of the order of ∼ 21 kJ mol(-1), above the interaction energy of a benzene dimer (11.3 kJ mol(-1)) and close to that of a water dimer (20.9 kJ mol(-1)). The interaction energy for the second most stable dimer can be compared with either that of a benzene dimer or of a C-H...π hydrogen bond. The remaining five weakly interacting dimers (∼ 4.2-8.4 kJ mol(-1)) can be characterized as having stronger interactions than those of methane dimers (-2.2 kJ mol(-1)), but weaker than those of benzene molecule pairs or weak C-H...C interactions for instance.",

    "abstract": "Ten new crystal structures of cis and trans bicyclic diketopiperazines (DKPs) of thia-pipecolic acid (with sulfur in the β, γ or δ position) or thia-proline (with sulfur in the β or γ position) and N -methyl phenylalanine [(NMe)Phe]: cyclo [(β-S)Pip-(NMe)Phe], cyclo [(γ-S)Pip-(NMe)Phe], cyclo [(δ-S)Pip-(NMe)Phe], cyclo [(β-S)Pro-(NMe)Phe] and cyclo [(γ-S)Pro-(NMe)Phe] were determined with X-ray crystallography. Density functional theory calculations of these molecules in the gas phase succeed in reproducing the observed molecular conformations in the crystal remarkably well. This illustrates the weak to moderate impact of intermolecular packing forces in the absence of classical N—H...O hydrogen bonds. The effect of sulfur on the geometry of the DKP ring and details of amide bond non-planarity are discussed. Molecular flexibility of the DKP ring, as estimated from the calculated deformation energies of its endocyclic ring torsion angles, is not in general the decisive factor for the occurrence of multiple symmetry independent molecules in the unit cell ( Z ′ &gt; 1), though in some cases a correlation is observed.",

    "abstract": "The concept of the Source Function (SF) for the reconstruction of the electron density first appeared in the seminal study published by Bader & Gatti, where it was unambiguously shown how the density at any given point is the effect of the action of the cause at all other points weighted by the influence function. One of the most important elements of the SF is the fact that it only depends on the value of the Laplacian of the density. This enables comparison of results from theoretical calculations with electron density studies based on high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In the featured paper by Gatti it is indisputably illustrated, by resorting to clever choices of chemical systems, how the SF approach applied to experimental data is able to clearly reveal electron delocalization effects in aromatic systems. Of particular significance in the introduction is the rebuttal of previously voiced criticism of the SF approach claiming that the SF approach will produce similar results if based on the physically meaningless promolecule density. Gatti and colleagues enhance the position of the SF as a key property that holds absolutely vital information about chemical bonding in molecular systems.",

Its molecular structure in the crystal has been determined by X-ray diffraction, and its gas phase structure was obtained by quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. In order to understand the dynamics of the molecule, two presumably soft degrees of freedom associated with the relative orientation of the planar benzoxazolone system and its substituent at the N atom were varied systematically. Five conformers have been identified as local minima on the resulting two-dimensional potential energy surface within an energy window of 27 kJ mol(-1). The energetically most favourable minimum closely matches the conformation observed in the crystal. Based on high-resolution diffraction data collected at low temperature, the experimental electron density of the compound was determined. Comparison with the electron density established by theory for the isolated molecule allowed the effect of intermolecular interactions to be addressed, in particular a moderately strong O-H...O hydrogen bond with a donor...acceptor distance of 2.6177 (9) Å: the oxygen acceptor is clearly polarized in the extended solid. The hydrogen bond connects consecutive molecules to chains, and the pronounced charge separation leads to stacking between neighburs with antiparallel dipole moments perpendicular to the chain direction.",

Pure tetragonal phase partially stabilized zirconia powders are synthesized through the co-precipitation method by incorporating 4% Eu(3+). The powder is subjected to compression cycles to promote the tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation. The Rietveld analysis of the X-ray powder diffraction patterns, recorded after each compression cycle, gives information about the lattice parameters and monoclinic phase content. The determination of europium content in the residual tetragonal phase is accomplished considering the unit cell volume of t-ZrO2 using Vegard's law. Using this information the compositional fluctuations over the sample were determined by considering two possible distributions of lanthanide ion content in the powders: a Gaussian and a Log-normal one. It was found that the Gaussian distribution better fits the experimental data. It was eventually demonstrated that these results are physically meaningful.",

An analysis of the relationship between symmetry and diffuse scattering for the studied system has been undertaken. The symmetry of the system explains the extinction pattern, taking the form of curves, on the diffuse scattering planes. We have also tested the relationship between the average structure model and scattering intensities. Two models, differing in their representation of overlapping atoms, were used. In the case of diffuse scattering the difference between resulting intensities is immense, while for the Bragg intensities it is much smaller. This sensitivity of diffuse scattering could potentially be used to improve the description of the average structure.",

The interactions between phosphines and boranes were classified into three types; two types depend on groups on the boron atom, whereas the third one involves frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). The data enabled geometric parameters in structures to be compared with phosphine–borane FLPs with classical Lewis pairs. Most of the crystal structures (78.1%) contain BH 3 as the borane group. In these systems, the boron–phosphorus distance is shorter than systems where the boron atom is surrounded by groups other than hydrogen atoms. The analysis of the CSD data has shown that FLPs have a tendency for the longest boron–phosphorus distance among all phosphine–borane pairs, as well as different other geometrical parameters. The results show that most of the frustrated phosphine–borane pairs found in crystal structures are bridged ones. The minority of non-bridged FLP structures contain, beside phosphorus and boron atoms, other heteroatoms (O, N, S for instance).",

Three distinct phases have been identified. The high-temperature α and low-temperature γ phases share the same space group Pbca, whereas the intermediate β phase is in the Pb21a subgroup of Pbca. In all phases molecules of (1) form well defined double layers, with PEt3 groups interlocking in planes perpendicular to c. On the molecular level, both phase transitions involve almost uniquely a conformational change of triethylphosphine: a gear-like rotation around the P-Au axis and concerted flips of the ethyl moieties. The mechanism of these transitions may be imagined as initiated by a rotation of a single PEt3 group in a double layer (a single gear movement), followed by adjacent phosphines adjusting their conformations as a result of steric strain. The structural changes underlying phase transitions are sequential, occurring layer-wise, the γ→β transition involving approximately every other layer in the crystal lattice, the β→α yielding a total conformation change. The sequence of phase transitions results in a noticeable contraction of the crystal cell volume.",

The quantum-chemical calculations combined with electron-transfer theory reveal that the incorporation of sulfur-linked side chains decreases reorganization energy associated with hole transfer and optimizes intermolecular π–π stacking, which results in excellent ambipolar charge-transport properties (μ h = 1.15 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and μ e = 0.08 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ); in comparison, addition of dibutylamino side chains increases intermolecular steric interactions and hinders perfect intermolecular π–π stacking, which results in the weak electronic couplings and finally causes the low intrinsic hole mobility (μ h = 0.01 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ). Furthermore, electronic spectra of butyl-IFD, butylthio-IFD and dibutylamino-IFD were simulated and compared with the reported experimental data.

Gd2O3 was grown at low (250°C) and high (850°C) temperatures with different oxygen partial pressure as well as a temperature ramp up during growth. At low temperature, the cubic bixbyite type of crystal structure with space group Ia{\\bar 3} was grown at low oxygen partial pressure. The layers consist of two domains oriented orthogonal to each other. The epitaxial relationships for the two domains were found to be Gd2O3(110)[001]||Si(001)[110] and Gd2O3(110)[001]||Si(001)[{\\bar 1}10], respectively. Applying additional oxygen during growth results in a change in crystal and domain structures of the grown layer into the monoclinic Sm2O3-type of structure with space group C2/m with (20\\bar 1) orientation and mainly two orthogonal domains with the epitaxial relationship Gd2O3(20\\bar 1)[010]||Si(100)〈110〉 and a smooth surface morphology. Some smaller areas have two intermediate azimuthal orientations between these variants, which results in a six-domain structure. The change in crystal structure can be understood based on the Gibbs-Thomson effect caused by the initial nucleation of nanometre-sized islands and its variation in diameter with a change in growth conditions. The crystal structure remains stable even against a temperature ramp up during growth. The layers grown at high temperature exhibit a nanowire-like surface morphology, where the nanowires have a cubic crystal structure and are aligned orthogonal to each other along the 〈110〉 in-plane directions. An increase in oxygen supply results in a reduced length and increased number of nanowires due to lower adatom mobility. The results clearly indicate that both kinetic and thermodynamic factors have a strong impact on the crystal structure, epitaxial relationship and morphology of the grown layers.",

    "abstract": "The photovoltaic perovskite, methylammonium lead triiodide [CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (MAPbI 3 )], is one of the most efficient materials for solar energy conversion. Various kinds of chemical and physical modifications have been applied to MAPbI 3 towards better understanding of the relation between composition, structure, electronic properties and energy conversion efficiency of this material. Pressure is a particularly useful tool, as it can substantially reduce the interatomic spacing in this relatively soft material and cause significant modifications to the electronic structure. Application of high pressure induces changes in the crystal symmetry up to a threshold level above which it leads to amorphization. Here, a detailed structural study of MAPbI 3 at high hydrostatic pressures using Ne and Ar as pressure transmitting media is reported. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments with synchrotron radiation at room temperature in the 0–20 GPa pressure range show that atoms of both gaseous media, Ne and Ar, are gradually incorporated into MAPbI 3 , thus leading to marked structural changes of the material. Specifically, Ne stabilizes the high-pressure phase of Ne x MAPbI 3 and prevents amorphization up to 20 GPa. After releasing the pressure, the crystal has the composition of Ne 0.97 MAPbI 3 , which remains stable under ambient conditions. In contrast, above 2.4 GPa, Ar accelerates an irreversible amorphization. The distinct impacts of Ne and Ar are attributed to differences in their chemical reactivity under pressure inside the restricted space between the PbI 6 octahedra.",

The synthesis of a-TiO 2 nanocrystals and their properties have been heavily scrutinized, but there exists a clear gap between the scientific literature, and the scale and price expectation of industrial application. Here it is demonstrated that the industrially most attractive Ti precursor, titanyl sulfate (TiOSO 4 ), can be combined with the green, scalable and fast supercritical flow method to produce phase pure and highly crystalline a-TiO 2 nanoparticles with high specific surface area. Control of the nanocrystal morphology is important since it is known that certain facets substantially promote catalytic activity. It is, however, in itself challenging to determine nanocrystal morphology to provide a rational basis for the synthesis control. Here we advocate the use of advanced Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data including anisotropic size broadening models in aiding to establish the sample three-dimensional morphology. This relatively quick and robust method assists in overcoming the often encountered ambiguity inherent in two-dimensional to three-dimensional reconstruction of selected particle morphologies with transmission electron microscopy and tomography techniques.",

Their crystal structures have been studied by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction; all three structures comprise borophosphate chain anions with a B:P ratio of 1:2. The unique construction of (I) is based on four-membered-ring chains running parallel to the [010] direction. These protonated borophosphate chains are linked via hydrogen-bond interactions to form a 3D framework with caesium cations incorporated. (II) is the first Cs and Mn 2+ ,Mn 3+ member of a known family characterized by [BP 2 O 8 ] ∞ helical chains running along [001]. These chains are connected through MnO 4 (H 2 O) 2 octahedra to form a 3D framework. The caesium cations are disordered over two independent positions in the channels, which they occupy together with water molecules. An additional MnO 2 (H 2 O) 3 bipyramid statistically shares a common edge and two corners with three main Mn octahedra to form tetrameric clusters. The topological relation between the chain anionic fragments of (I) and (II) as well as the structural relation between (I) and previously studied boro- and berillophosphates are discussed. Compound (III) presents the first Mn member of the A I M III [BP 2 O 8 (OH)] family and is characterized by a 3D framework built by open-branched borophosphate chains and MnO 5 semi-octahedra sharing vertices.

The commensurate structure with a modulation wavevector q = 5c*/6 was analyzed in a conventional manner in 3D space, while a structure model in (3+1)-dimensional superspace was used for the other two crystals with modulation wavevectors slightly differing from 5c*/6. The superstructure of the commensurate phase was described using the space group P4/n and a common superspace group I4/m(00γ)00 was used for the (3+1)D structures of all three crystals. The whole structure of each crystal consists of two substructures. Basis vectors a and b are common, but c is different for the two substructures. The first substructure is a host framework constructed by (Li/Al)O4 tetrahedra sharing edges. A linear connection of cavities is seen to be channel-like, in which Sr ions locate as guest cations forming the second substructure. The crystal of q = 5c*/6 contains five Sr ions per six cavities in a channel. Sr ions are distributed at seven sites, some of which are partially occupied. Statistical disorder of local structure models for the location of Sr ions in the channel was assumed to explain the results. Such a partially disordered character was also seen in the incommensurate phases and properly embodied by a (3+1)D model containing an atomic domain of the Sr ion with occupational modulation. Plots of the occupation factor, interatomic distances and the bond valence sum at each metal site as functions of t (= x4 - q·r) are roughly identical in the three crystals, which are considered as members of the same series of composite crystals.",

A combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, powder Raman spectroscopy and first-principle calculations in both crystalline and gaseous phases has shown that changes in the O—H...O hydrogen-bond geometry can be followed by changes in the corresponding spectral modes. Vibrational properties of moderate hydrogen bonds can be estimated from correlations based on statistical analysis of several compounds [Novak (1974). Struct. Bond. 18 , 177–216]. However, frequencies related to very short O—H...O bonds can only be predicted by relationships built from a subset of structurally similar systems. Moreover, the way in which hydrogen bonds affect the polarizability of donor and acceptor groups depends on their strength. Moderate interactions enhance the polarizability and make it more anisotropic. Shorter hydrogen bonds may decrease the polarizability of a group as a consequence of the volume restraint implied by the neighbour molecule within a hydrogen-bonded aggregate. This is significant for evaluation of the electric susceptibility in crystals and, therefore, for estimation of refractive indices and birefringence.",

The Rietveld refinement provided the average structure and gave no indication of a long-range ordering. The refinement to the PDF turned out to be very sensitive to small structural details, giving insight into the local structure. The lattice-energy minimizations revealed a significantly preferred local ordering of neighbouring molecules along the [0\\bar 11] direction.

Experimentally measured structure factors have been used to determine and characterize charge density via the multipole model (MM) and the maximum entropy method (MEM). Theoretical investigation of the electron density and the electronic structure has been performed in the finite basis set density functional theory (DFT) framework. Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM), deformation densities and Laplacians maps have been used to compare theoretical and experimental results. MM experimental results and predictions from theory differ with respect to the sign and/or magnitude of the Laplacian at the N-O bond critical point (BCP), depending on the treatment of n values of the MM radial functions. Such Laplacian differences in the N-O bond case are discussed with respect to a lack of flexibility in the MM radial functions also reported by Rykounov et al. [Acta Cryst. (2011), B67, 425-436]. BCP Hessian eigenvalues show qualitatively matching results between MM and DFT. In addition, the theoretical analysis used domain-averaged fermi holes (DAFH), natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and localized (LOC) orbitals to characterize the N-O bond as a single σ bond with marginal π character. Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) has been employed to compare to the MM refinement results and/or neutron dataset C-H bond lengths and to crystal or single molecule geometry optimizations, including considerations of anisotropy of H atoms. Our findings help to understand properties of molecules like MTTOTHP as progenitors of free oxygen radicals.",

    "abstract": "The present paper reports a theoretical investigation based on first-principles density functional theory calculations to predict the external morphology of the tetragonal GdVO 4 crystal from its internal structure. The Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker (BFDH) method, attachment energy (AE) method and surface energy (SE) method were used in this study. Slice energies (cohesive, attachment and specific surface) of the three main crystal faces having (110), (101) and (200) orientation and their d hkl thicknesses were computed using CRYSTAL17 code, in the frame of a 2D periodic slab model. The relative growth rate ( R hkl ) and the morphological importance (MI hkl ) for each unrelaxed and relaxed ( hkl ) face of interest were determined. Consequently, the crystal shapes predicted based upon BFDH, AE and SE methods were represented by the Wulff construction. The results of the morphology crystal predictions, based on the above methods, were compared both against each other and against the experimentally observed morphologies. A quite satisfactory agreement between the predicted and observed crystal morphologies is noticed.",

    "abstract": "The synthetically modified green fluorescent protein chromophore analogue 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylidene imidazolinone ( 1 ) yielded five polymorphs (I, II, III, IV, V) concomitantly irrespective of the solvent used for crystallization. The pentamorphic modification of 1 is solely due to the interplay of iso-energetic weak intermolecular interactions in molecular associations as well as the conformational flexibility offered by a C—C single bond, which connects the electron-deficient moiety imidazolinone with the electron-rich trimethoxybenzylidene group. A common structural feature observed in all the polymorphs is the formation of a `zero-dimensional' centrosymmetric dimeric unit through a short and linear C—H...O hydrogen bond engaging phenyl C—H and imidazolinone carbonyl oxygen. However, the networking of these dimeric units showed a subtle difference in all the polymorphs. The 2D isostructurality was observed between polymorphs I, II and III, while the other two polymorphs IV and V revealed only `zero-dimensional' isostructurality. The different fluorescence emissions of Form I (blue) and Forms II to V (yellow) were attributed to the differences in π-stacking interactions. It shows that one can modulate the photophysical properties of these smart materials by slightly altering their crystal structure. Such an approach will aid in developing new multi-colour organic fluorescent materials of varying crystal structures for live-cell imaging and fluorescent sensing applications.",

The coformers used in this study were benzoic acid, p -hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, γ-resorcylic acid and gallic acid. In each of the cocrystals distinct structural features have been found, including a variable amount of water and different heterosynthons, indicating that there is more than one type of intermolecular interaction preferred by the linezolid molecule. Basing on the frequency of the observed supramolecular synthons, the proposed hierarchy of the hydrogen-bond acceptor sites of linezolid (LIN) is C=O amide &gt; C=O oxazolidone &gt; C—O—C morpholine &gt; C—N—C morpholine &gt; C—O—C oxazolidone . In addition, aromatic–aromatic interactions were found to be important in the stabilization of the analyzed structures. The obtained cocrystals show modified thermal properties, with four of them having melting points lower than the temperature of the phase transition from linezolid form II to linezolid form III. Such a change in this physicochemical property allows for the future application of melting-based techniques of introducing linezolid into drug delivery systems. In addition a change in water solubility of linezolid upon cocrystalization was evaluated, but only in the case of the cocrystal with protocatechuic acid was there a significant (43%) improvement in solubility in comparison with linezolid.",

Dibenzoylmethane was isolated from Hottonia palustris L. (Primulaceae). The compound was crystallized in two polymorphic forms: in monoclinic space group P 2 1 / c and orthorhombic space group Pbca . Crystal structures of the polymorphs were solved and refined against diffraction data measured at 100 and 293 K. In both crystal structures, the chalcone occurs in its keto–enol tautomeric form with the hydroxyl H atom mutually bound by two oxygen atoms rather than covalently attached to a particular oxygen atom. To explain this phenomenon in more detail, density functional theory and quantum theory of atoms in molecules based quantum chemistry calculations were applied. Additionally, high-resolution experimental data of very high quality measured for the monoclinic and orthorhombic crystals at 100 K allowed the engagement of the quantum crystallography method, based on Hirshfeld atom refinement, to determine the position of each individual H atom. It is suggested that the presence of the particular tautomeric form of dibenzoylmethane with a centred H atom position results from the π-stacking interaction between the phenyl ring and the malondialdehyde quasi-ring causes delocalization of the electron density in the latter.",

Semiconductors from this group of materials are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. Their properties strongly depend on point defects, in particular related to cation order-disorder. However, Cu+, Zn2+ and Fe2+ have very similar scattering factors and are all but indistinguishable in usual X-ray diffraction experiments. Anomalous diffraction utilizes the dependency of the atomic scattering factors f' and f'' of the energy of the radiation, especially close to the element-specific absorption edges. In the MEAD technique, individual Bragg peaks are tracked over an absorption edge. The intensity changes depending on the structure factor can be highly characteristic for Miller indices selected for a specific structural problem, but require very exact measurements. Beamline KMC-2 at synchrotron BESSY II, Berlin, has been recently upgraded for this technique. Anomalous X-ray powder diffraction and XAFS compliment the data. Application of this technique confirmed established cation distribution in Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) and Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS). In contrast to the literature, cation distribution in Cu2ZnSiSe4 (CZSiSe) is shown to adopt a highly ordered wurtz-kesterite structure type.",

    "abstract": "4-Methylhippuric acid {systematic name: 2-[(4-methylbenzoyl)amino]ethanoic acid}, a p -xylene excreted metabolite with a backbone containing three rotatable bonds (R-bonds), is likely to produce more than one stable molecular structure in the solid state. In this work, we prepared polymorph I by slow solvent evaporation (plates with Z ′ = 1) and polymorph II by mechanical grinding (plates with Z ′ = 2). Potential energy surface (PES) analysis, rotating the molecule about the C—C—N—C torsion angle, shows four conformational energy basins. The second basin, with torsion angles near −73°, agree with the conformations adopted by polymorph I and molecules A of polymorph II , and the third basin at 57° matched molecules B of polymorph II . The energy barrier between these basins is 27.5 kJ mol −1 . Superposition of the molecules of polymorphs I and II rendered a maximum r.m.s. deviation of 0.398 Å. Polymorphs I and II are therefore true conformational polymorphs. The crystal packing of polymorph I consists of C (5) chains linked by N—H...O interactions along the a axis and C (7) chains linked by O—H...O interactions along the b axis. In polymorph II , two molecules ( A with A or B with B ) are connected by two acid–amide O—H...O interactions rendering R 2 2 (14) centrosymmetric dimers. These dimers alternate to pile up along the b axis linked by N—H...O interactions. A Hirshfeld surface analysis localized weaker noncovalent interactions, C—H...O and C—H...π, with contact distances close to the sum of the van der Waals radii. Electron density at a local level using the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and the Electron Localization Function (ELF), or a semi-local level using noncovalent interactions, was used to rank interactions. Strong closed shell interactions in classical O—H...O and N—H...O hydrogen bonds have electron density highly localized on bond critical points. Weaker delocalized electron density is seen around the p -methylphenyl rings associated with dispersive C—H...π and H...H interactions.",

    "abstract": "A novel analytical approach is proposed for the characterization of organic molecular crystal structures where close packing is an important factor. It requires the identification of a unique reference axis within the crystal, along which three-dimensional space is divided into close-packed blocks (CPB) and junction zones (JZ). The degree of close packing along the reference axis is quantified by a two-dimensional packing function, ϕ2D, of symmetry determined by the space group. Values of ϕ2D reflect the degree of area-filling in planes perpendicular to this axis. The requirement of close packing within CPB allows the planar structures perpendicular to the reference axis to be analysed as tessellations of area-filling molecular-based cells (MBC), which are generally hexagonal. The form of these cells reflects the molecular shape in the cross-section, since their vertices are given by the centres of the voids between molecules. There are two basic types of MBC, Type 1, of glide or pseudo-glide symmetry, and Type 2, which is formed by lattice translations alone and generally requires a short unit-cell axis. MBC at layers of special symmetry are used to characterize the structures in terms of equivalent ellipses with parameters aell, bell and χell. The ratio aell/bell allows the established α, β, γ classification to be integrated into the current framework. The values of parameters aell and bell arising from all the structures considered, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), substituted anthracenes and anthraquinones (SAA) and 2-benzyl-5-benzylidene (BBCP) are mapped onto a universal curve. The division of three-dimensional space into CPB and JZ is fundamentally useful for crystal engineering, since the structural perturbations brought about by substitution at hydrogen positions located within JZ are minimal. A contribution is also made to ongoing debate concerning the adoption of polar space groups, isomorphism and polymorphism.",

The aluminate slabs are further linked by chains of edge-sharing [CuO4] square planes to form a mixed anionic three-dimensional framework with Cs(+) cations in channels and cavities.

The crystal structures and their molecular packing have been analyzed for a series of dialkyl succinates with 1-4 C atoms in the alkyl side chain. The energy difference (ΔE) between the optimized and observed molecular conformations, density, Kitaigorodskii packing index (KPI) and C-H...O interactions are considered to rationalize this behavior. In contrast to the dialkyl oxalates where a larger number of moderately strong C-H...O interactions were characteristic of oxalates with elevated melting points, here the molecular packing and the density play a major role in raising the melting point. On moving from oxalate to succinate esters the introduction of the C2 spacer adds two activated H atoms to the asymmetric unit, resulting in the formation of stronger C-H...O hydrogen bonds in all succinates. As a result the crystallinity of long-chain alkyl substituted esters improves enormously in the presence of hydrogen bonds from activated donors.",

    "abstract": "3-Furylfulgides are photochromic compounds showing high thermal stability in their closed forms. However, their photochromic properties in the solid state should be improved further to fabricate molecular devices. Understanding how the size and the flexibility of the non-aromatic alkylidene moiety alter the crystalline state photochromic properties is also important here, as the alkylidene group is directly involved in the photochromic ring closing and opening reactions. The synthesis of four 3-furylfulgides composed of different alkylidene groups (rigid isopropyl, flexible 2-butyl, rigid cyclopentyl and flexible cyclohexyl), their crystal structures and structure-photochromic property correlation in the crystalline state are reported here. Crystallographic data along with reaction cavity volumes calculated using the program CAVITY [Ohashi et al. (1981), J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, 5805-5812] disclosed that fulgides with flexible groups at the ring closing site have more free volume around the reactive area in the crystal lattice, which can provide more space for the atomic movements in the reaction and flexibility can reduce the strain built up in the closed C-isomers by making conformations. According to UV-vis spectroscopic data, a higher yield of C-isomers and a better fatigue resistance were obtained for the 3-furylfulgide with the largest and flexible cyclohexyl group showing greater photochromic properties in the crystalline state than the fulgide containing the smallest and rigid isopropyl group.",

In order to underline this structural relationship, topological properties of the electron density in VB, V3B4 and VB2 reconstructed from high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction data as well as derived from quantum chemical calculations, are analysed in terms of Bader's Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules [Bader (1990). Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory, 1st ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press]. The compounds VB, V3B4 and VB2 are characterized by a charge transfer from the metal to boron together with two predominant atomic interactions, the shared covalent B-B interactions and the polar covalent B-M interactions. The resembling features of the crystal structures are well reflected by the respective B-B interatomic distances as well as by ρ(r) values at the B-B bond critical points. The latter decrease with an increase in the corresponding interatomic distances. The B-B bonds show transferable electron density properties at bond critical points depending on the respective bond distances.",

A comparison shows that the known differences in the mechanical properties between the `strong' biogenic and `brittle' abiotic material should be attributed to the mesoscopic architecture of the crystal rather than to a modification of the calcite crystal structure. The data are rationalized by comparing them to the results of ab initio model calculations of lattice dynamics. For the mesocrystal, they are augmented by the evaluation of the faceting of the constituent nanocrystals.",

    "abstract": "A size-strain line-broadening analysis of the XRPD patterns and Raman spectra for two anatase/brookite (TiO2)-based nanocomposites with carbon (C) was carried out and the results compared with those of a similar sample free of carbon. The crystal structures and microstructures of anatase and brookite, as well as their relative abundance ratio, have been refined from XRPD data by the Rietveld method (the low amount of carbon is neglected). The XRPD size-strain analysis resulted in reliable structure and microstructure results for both anatase and brookite. The experimental Raman spectra of all the samples in the region 100-200 cm-1 are dominated by a strong feature primarily composed of the most intense modes of anatase (Eg) and brookite (A1g). The anatase crystallite sizes of 14-17 nm, estimated by XRPD, suggest the application of the phonon confinement model (PCM) for the analysis of the anatase Eg mode, whereas the relatively large brookite crystallite size (27-29 nm) does not imply the use of the PCM for the brookite A1g mode. Superposition of the anatase Eg mode profile, calculated by the PCM, and the Lorentzian shape of the brookite A1g mode provide an appropriate simulation of the change in the dominant Raman feature in the spectra of TiO2-based nanocomposites with carbon. Raman spectra measured in the high-frequency range (1000-2000 cm-1) provide information on carbon in the investigated nanocomposite materials. The results from field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nitrogen physisorption measurements support the XRPD and Raman results.",

As a result of the reaction at high pressure, crystals of the pure product were obtained, which allowed for monitoring of the reaction until its completion. The initial increase in the unit-cell volume caused by the reaction under ambient conditions was reduced at high pressure due to the decrease in the void volume. Despite the smaller size of the void volume at high pressure, dimer molecules formed during the reaction changed the orientation of the monomer molecules in the crystal structure. The size of the voids above the terminal rings of the monomers correlates with the position of the terminal rings in the dimer. The reaction rate increased at high pressure, indicating that the decrease in the distance between adjacent monomers caused by pressure dominates over the decrease in the void volume. This distance is statistically constant as the reaction progresses, contrary to the reaction at ambient pressure.",

Whereas the latter is well known for being incommensurately modulated at ambient conditions, neither krennerite nor sylvanite present any modulation. This is attributed to the presence of relatively strong Te-Te bonds (bond distances < 2.9 Å) in the two minerals, which are absent in calaverite (bond distances > 3.2 Å). In both tellurides, trivalent gold occurs in slightly distorted square planar coordination, whereas monovalent gold, partly substituted by monovalent silver, presents a 2+2+2 coordination, corresponding to distorted rhombic bipyramids. The differentiation between bonding and non-bonding contacts is obtained by computation of the Effective Coordination Number (ECoN). The CHARge DIstribution (CHARDI) analysis is satisfactory for both tellurides but suggests that the Te-Te bond in the [Te3]2- anion is not entirely homopolar. Both tellurides can therefore be described as Madelung-type compounds, despite the presence of Te-Te in both structures.",

Amongst them, six groups were formed based on similarities in unit-cell dimensions, space group and molecular assembly of the crystal. The analysis reveals that all the crystal structures contain robust N-H...O hydrogen bonds which are the primary building blocks with ancillary interactions such as C-H...O, C-H...π, C-H...F/Cl/Br/I, F...F, F...π, I...π, Br...π, I...O and Br...O. The role of short and directional C-H...O and C-H...π interactions providing significant stabilization to the densely packed crystalline arrangement is discussed. The contribution of these interactions in stabilizing the crystalline assembly was deduced via computing total interaction energy between dimers and the overall lattice energies using the computer programs Crystal Explorer 17.5 and PIXELC, respectively. Additionally, the occurrence of 3D isostructurality in phosphoradimates and their halogenated analogs was investigated using the XPac program. A comparison of the magnitudes of the torsion angles in the compounds substantiates the role of conformational flexibility in the solid state.",

In the November 2019 version of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), there are 2592 organic, P1, R ≤ 0.050 structures; complete, unique entries are available for 1407 Z = Z' > 1 and 1049 Z = Z' = 1 structures. All the Z > 1 structures can have approximate symmetry; the Z = 1 structures were scanned to find those composed of molecules or ions that might lie on a special position and those that have two or more large molecules or ions that are very similar. The number of Z = 1 structures so identified was 285, of which 49 were grouped with the Z > 1 structures because Zeffective > 1. The packing in each of the 1407 + 285 = 1692 structures was investigated. The 144 that should almost certainly have been described in a smaller or higher-symmetry unit cell were removed from the list; 120 of the 144 are composed of achiral or racemic material. (About half of the Z = 1 and 89% of the Z > 1 structures are composed of enantiopure material.) Approximate periodic symmetry was found in 86% of the 1337 remaining Z > 1 structures and in 72% of the 211 remaining Z = 1 structures. About a third of the enantiomerically pure structures mimic inversion symmetry; 38% have approximate rotational symmetry. For the structures of achiral and racemic material, distorted glide or mirror symmetry is more common than is distorted inversion symmetry. Approximate rotational and glide symmetry was found to be periodic in two dimensions considerably more often than in three. In 4% of the structures, different layer types alternate or layers are related by approximate local rotations, as well as by small translations. In 5% of the structures, different parts of the molecule are segregated into two-dimensional regions that have different approximate symmetries. More than a third of the structures that are a distorted version of a higher-symmetry structure were determined at T ≥ 288 K.",

    "abstract": "Validation of a method for distinguishing between salts and cocrystals based on dispersion-corrected density functional theory is presented. Existing related works (van de Streek &amp; Neumann, 2010; LeBlanc et al. , 2018) indicate that this approach is problematic and leads to incorrect results in multiple situations. The method suggested here is based on the geometry optimization of an artificially constructed wrong structure (hydrogen atom placed in salt position near the potential acceptor for cocrystals and vice versa cocrystal position with hydrogen atom placed near the potential donor of the salts). The verification of the method is based on comparison of the results with an experimentally confirmed correct hydrogen position. Calculations were performed on 173 selected structures of salts and 96 cocrystals with Δp K a in the critical 〈−1, 4〉 range. The range was chosen to test the method on the most problematic structures. When the artificial wrong model did not converge to the correct one (salt to cocrystal and vice versa), it was tested whether the correct model converged to the correct one in addition. The results confirmed that the most widely used functional (PBE) tends to generate false salt results. All salts converged to the salt from cocrystal initial models. Sixteen cocrystals showed local energy minima for both the salt and cocrystal states. Eighteen cocrystals always converged to salt. Rules were identified under which the results can be considered reliable: when a cocrystal starting model converges to cocrystal, the structure is certainly cocrystal. When both the cocrystal and salt models converge to salt for a long hydrogen-bond (longer than 2.613 Å) the structure is most likely salt. For short hydrogen bonds it is not possible to distinguished reliably between salt and cocrystal using the dispersion-corrected PBE functional. Additional calculations were performed with more advanced functionals for 18 problematic structures detected in the screening as well as for four more mentioned in the literature. The results show that the rSCAN functional (Bartók &amp; Yates, 2019) improves the agreement with the experiment. Further improvement was observed by using hybrid functionals (PBE0, PBE50), which were tested on structures that gave incorrect results with rSCAN. The described method for distinguishing salts from cocrystals can be useful for enhancing the information given by structure solutions from powder, the verification of structure solutions from single crystals and studies related to crystal structure prediction.",

    "abstract": "Cocrystallization is a promising method for generating new energetic materials with improved performances. Herein, a novel energetic cocrystal composed of 1 H -tetrazole/sodium perchlorate was prepared using the solvent evaporation method. This cocrystal is characterized as containing organic azole derivatives and an ionic perchlorate salt, which is used as an oxidizer in pyrotechnics. The crystal structure was determined via single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The as-prepared crystal exhibited a lamellar structure consisting of 1 H -tetrazole and sodium perchlorate layers. A molecular structure comparison between the cocrystal and pristine ingredients revealed variations in the bond lengths and angles owing to the cocrystallization. The hydrogen bond formed by adjacent tetrazole rings was strengthened. The 1 H -tetrazole/sodium perchlorate cocrystal was structurally compared with crystals previously reported to the Cambridge Structural Database including sodium perchlorate in lamellar structures. The lamellar structure of the cocrystal exhibited weak layer-to-layer interactions compared with those of the other crystals. Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy analyses were conducted, and the relationship between the spectroscopy results and the crystal/molecular structure are discussed. The results of the spectroscopic analyses exhibited peak shifts that indicate structural changes in bond lengths and angles owing to the cocrystallization.",

The results of structure refinement using three different models (a harmonic with and without disorder, and an anharmonic) were compared. The temperature dependencies of anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) and Ueq, which can be calculated directly from ADPs, for the low-temperature PE phase indicate clearly the dynamic nature of disorder of the K1 atoms. The structures of the low-temperature and the high-temperature PE phases are compared for the first time at multiple temperatures for each phase based on diffraction data collected from the same single crystal. The data indicate that the high-temperature and the low-temperature paraelectric phases are probably not two different phases, as was assumed in earlier works, but are structurally the same phase at different temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Traditional X-ray methods are extensively applied to commercial cement samples in order to determine their physical and chemical properties. Powder patterns are routinely used to quantify the composition of these phase mixtures, but structure determination becomes difficult because of reflection overlapping caused by the high number of different crystal structures. The fast-growing 3D electron diffraction technique and its related automated acquisition protocols arise as a potentially very interesting tool for the cement industry, since they enable the fast and systematic acquisition of diffraction data from individual particles. In this context, electron diffraction has been used in the investigation of the different crystalline phases present in various commercial clinkers for cement. Automated data collection procedures and subsequent data processing have enabled the structural characterization of the different crystal structures from which the α′ H polymorph of Ca 2 SiO 4 (belite) exhibited satellite reflections. Its average crystal structure has been known since 1971 and satellite reflections have been reported previously, yet the modulation was never fully described by means of the superspace formalism. Here, the incommensurately modulated structure is solved and refined using harmonic and crenel functions in the superspace group Pnma (α00)0 ss , showing the potential of 3D electron diffraction for systematic crystallographic characterizations of cement. A full description of the different belite polymorphs is provided considering this modulated structure.",

This work provides insights into the complex interplay of hydrogen-bonding and halogen-bonding interactions resulting in the formation of multiple trimeric motifs in the crystal structure of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives. Analysis of the crystal packing of these isostructural crystal structures revealed that the molecular arrangement in these molecules is primarily stabilized by the formation of different trimeric motifs stabilized by N-H...N hydrogen bonds, N-H...X (X = Cl/Br) halogen bonds and C-X...X halogen-bonding interactions. Computational studies further revealed that all these trimers are energetically stable. A crystallographic database search further reveals that while the cyclic trimers reported in this study are present in other molecules, structures analyzed in this study are the sole instances where all are present simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Results of the neutron powder diffraction measurements carried out for R 5 Pt 2 In 4 ( R = Tb–Tm) are reported. The compounds crystallize in an orthorhombic crystal structure of the Lu 5 Ni 2 In 4 -type with the rare earth atoms occupying three different sublattices. Neutron diffraction data reveal that at low temperatures the rare earth magnetic moments order below the critical temperature equal to 105, 93, 28, 12 and 3.8 K for R = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Tm, respectively. With decreasing temperature the rare earth magnetic moments at the 2 a and 4 g 2 sites order first, while the moments at the 4 g 1 site order at lower temperatures. Ferrimagnetic order along the c axis, described by the propagation vector k 1 = [0, 0, 0], develops in Tb 5 Pt 2 In 4 below the Curie temperature ( T C = 105 K). At lower temperatures, an antiferromagnetic component in the ab plane appears. The component is incommensurate with the crystal structure ( k 2 = [0, 0.66, ½]), but it turns into a commensurate one ( k 3 = [0, 0, ½]) with decreasing temperature. Antiferromagnetic order along the c axis, described by k 4 = [½, 0, 0], is found in Dy 5 Pt 2 In 4 below the Néel temperature ( T N = 93 K). The k 4 -related component disappears below 80 K and the magnetic structure transforms into a ferro/ferrimagnetic one described by k 1 = [0, 0, 0]. Further decrease in temperature leads to the appearance of an incommensurate antiferromagnetic component within the ab plane below 10 K ( k 2 = [0, 0.45, ½]), which finally turns into a commensurate one ( k 5 = [0, ½, ½]). In Ho 5 Pt 2 In 4 , a sine-modulated magnetic structure with moments parallel to the c axis ( k 6 = [⅓,0,0]) is observed below 28 K. With a decrease in temperature, new components, related to k 1 = [0, 0, 0] ( bc plane) and k 4 = [½, 0, 0] ( c axis), appear. The coexistence of two orderings – in the ab plane ( k 1 = [0, 0, 0]) and a modulated one with moments along the b axis ( k 7 = [ k x , 0, 0]) – is found in Er 5 Pt 2 In 4 below 12 K. Decreasing temperature leads to the order–order transformation of the k 1 -related component to another one with magnetic moments still constrained to the ab plane and preserved value of the propagation vector ( i.e. k 1 = [0, 0, 0]). Tm 5 Pt 2 In 4 orders antiferromagnetically below T N = 3.8 K. Thulium magnetic moments lie in the ab plane, while the magnetic structure is described by k 5 = [0, ½ , ½]. The direction of magnetic moments depends on the rare earth element involved and indicates an influence of single ion anisotropy resulting from interaction with the crystalline electric field.",

    "abstract": "The crystal structure of the incommensurate modulated phase of potassium guaninate monohydrate has been solved on the basis of high-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. The modulated structure was described as a `mosaic' sequence of three different local configurations of two neighbouring guaninate rings. In contrast to known examples of incommensurate modulated organic compounds, the modulation functions of all atoms are discontinuous. This is the first example of the experimental detection of an incommensurate modulated crystal structure that can be modelled using the special `soliton mode' modulation function proposed by Aramburu et al. [(1995), J. Phys. Condens. Matter, 7, 6187-6196].",

    "abstract": "A novel approach to computationally enhance the sampling of molecular crystal structures is proposed and tested. This method is based on the use of extended variables coupled to a Monte Carlo based crystal polymorph generator. Inspired by the established technique of quasi-random sampling of polymorphs using the rigid molecule constraint, this approach represents molecular clusters as extended variables within a thermal reservoir. Polymorph unit-cell variables are generated using pseudo-random sampling. Within this framework, a harmonic coupling between the extended variables and polymorph configurations is established. The extended variables remain fixed during the inner loop dedicated to polymorph sampling, enforcing a stepwise propagation of the extended variables to maintain system exploration. The final processing step results in a polymorph energy landscape, where the raw structures sampled to create the extended variable trajectory are re-optimized without the thermal coupling term. The foundational principles of this approach are described and its effectiveness using both a Metropolis Monte Carlo type algorithm and modifications that incorporate replica exchange is demonstrated. A comparison is provided with pseudo-random sampling of polymorphs for the molecule coumarin. The choice to test a design of this algorithm as relevant for enhanced sampling of crystal structures was due to the obvious relation between molecular structure variables and corresponding crystal polymorphs as representative of the inherent vapor to crystal transitions that exist in nature. Additionally, it is shown that the trajectories of extended variables can be harnessed to extract fluctuation properties that can lead to valuable insights. A novel thermodynamic variable is introduced: the free energy difference between ensembles of Z ′ = 1 and Z ′ = 2 crystal polymorphs.",

    "abstract": "Hydrothermal synthesis led to four novel 3D pillared-layer metal–organic frameworks: [Cu 4 (4,4′-bipy) 4 (MoO 4 ) 4 ·0.3H 2 O] n ( 1 ), [Cu(4,4′-bipy) 0.5 (MoO 4 )·0.25H 2 O] n ( 2 ), [Cu(4,4′-bipy)(MoO 4 )·0.1H 2 O] n ( 3 ), and [{Cu(4,4′-bipy)} 2 (Mo 8 O 26 ) 0.5 ] n ( 4 ). These compounds exhibit diverse supramolecular isomerism within their 3D coordination networks, each incorporating bimetallic {CuMoO} layers linked by 4,4′-bipyridine, demonstrating a remarkable structural diversity. Compound 1 features a 3D network derived from conformational supramolecular isomerism. Its bimetallic layer comprises fused 16-membered {Cu 4 Mo 4 O 8 } and eight-membered {Cu 2 Mo 2 O 4 } rings, with varying O—Cu—O bond angles affecting the network puckering and Cu–Cu distances. In contrast, the coordination networks observed in 2 , 3 , and 4 correspond to structural supramolecular isomers from the earlier stated networks. In 2 , centrosymmetric Cu 2+ dimers with distorted square-pyramidal geometry are linked along the c axis by 4,4′-bipyridine, forming 1D {Cu 2 (4,4′-bipy)} n chains with a Cu–Cu distance of 2.95 Å. Its oxide substructure comprises bilayers of fused 12-membered {Cu 3 Mo 3 O 6 } rings. Crystal structures 3 and 4 are particularly notable for their construction at the Cu + centers. In compound 4 , this isomerism is further influenced by the interplay between the distortion of the coordination geometry of both the Cu and Mo ions. The propensity to form these supramolecular isomers primarily stems from the flexible coordination environment of copper ions. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements corroborated the structural descriptions of the paramagnetic compounds 1 and 2 .",

Although two polymorphs, i.e. metastable monoclinic and high-density orthorhombic, have been reported for xylitol, only the latter is in practical use. Under high pressure, the same orthorhombic phase has been obtained by both isothermal and isochoric recrystallization. The stability of the orthorhombic xylitol phase to 5.0 GPa has been correlated with a uniform compression of all hydrogen bonds and some flexibility of the molecular conformation, which cushion the pressure-induced local strains. The anisotropic compressibility of xylitol and its thermal expansion are consistent with the rule of inverse effects of pressure and temperature. This inverse strain relationship has been correlated with the dimensions and orientation of xylitol molecules in the crystal structure.",

In glycerine or oil, α-SeC(NH 2 ) 2 transforms into phase β at 0.21 GPa; however in water, phase α initially increases its volume and can be compressed to 0.30 GPa due to the formation of α-SeC(NH 2 ) 2 · x H 2 O.

    "abstract": "Even though there has been a lot of studies on the magnetic properties of Fe x TiS 2 and their corresponding atomic structures at different Fe concentrations, the dependency of the properties on the Fe atomic arrangement has not been fully clarified yet. In this study, Fe x TiS 2 structures, synthesized by chemical vapor transport technique at Fe concentrations of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 0.25 and 0.33, were observed three-dimensionally using a transmission electron microscope and their corresponding magnetization values were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device. The results show a switch from local in-plane two-dimensional (2D) ordering of \\sqrt 3 a and 2 a at concentrations below 0.15 to three-dimensional (3D) ordering of 2 a × 2 a × 2 c at x = 0.20 and 0.25, as well as \\sqrt 3 a × \\sqrt 3 a × 2 c superstructures at x = 0.33, although it should be noted that the x = 0.20 sample only had partial ordering of Fe atoms. The type of Fe ordering present in Fe x TiS 2 could be explained by the balance of cohesive energy of neighboring Fe atoms and local strain energy imposed on the host structure due to the formation of Fe clusters. It is also found that the switch from 2D to 3D Fe order coincides with the magnetic measurements, which reveal spin-glass behavior below x = 0.15 and ferromagnetic behavior above x = 0.20. This suggests that the magnetic properties of the Fe x TiS 2 structure are highly influenced by the ordering of Fe atoms between planes.",

The positron lifetime spectra reveal the presence of both open volumes and shallow traps regardless of the sample composition. In particular, both average and bulk lifetimes are found to be much higher in ternary alloys (CdZnTe) than those in binary systems (CdTe and ZnTe). This originates from distinct differences in average electron densities and the nature of open-volume defects between binary and ternary samples. Competition in positron trapping with increasing Zn content is observed between defects characteristic for both structural systems. Moreover, a clear correlation is shown between defects and the lattice thermal conductivity of studied samples. The applicability of the positron trapping model to CdTe-based materials is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Alkali copper sulfates form a rapidly developing family of inorganics. Herein, we report synthesis and crystal structure, and evaluate possible ion migration pathways for a novel Na-K-Cu anhydrous sulfate, K(Na,K)Na 2 [Cu 2 (SO 4 ) 4 ]. The CuO 7 and SO 4 polyhedra share common vertices and edges to form [Cu 2 (SO 4 ) 4 ] 4− wide ribbons, which link to each other via common oxygen atoms forming the host part of the structure. Four guest alkali sites are occupied by solely K + , mixture of K + and Na + , and solely Na + , which agrees well with the size of the cavities. The crystal structure of K(Na,K)Na 2 [Cu 2 (SO 4 ) 4 ] contains two symmetry-independent Cu sites with [4+1+(2)] coordination environments. The overall coordination polyhedra of Cu 2+ can be considered as `octahedra with one split vertex'. A similar coordination mode was observed also in some other multinary copper sulfates, mostly of the mineral world. These coordination modes were reviewed and five types of CuO 7 polyhedra are identified. CuO 7 polyhedra are almost restricted to copper sulfates and phosphates. It was found that a larger amount of the smaller SO 4 2− and PO 4 3− anions can cluster around a single Cu 2+ cation; in addition, for such relatively small anions, both mono (κ 1 ) and bidentate (κ 2 ) coordination modes to the Cu 2+ are possible. The correlation between crystallographic characteristics and bond valence energies showed that the new copper sulfate framework, [Cu 2 (SO 4 ) 4 ] 4− , contains one interconnected path suitable for Na + mobility at tolerable activation energies and that K(Na,K)Na 2 [Cu 2 (SO 4 ) 4 ] can be considered as a potential candidate for novel Na-ion conductors.",

    "abstract": "The method of Ionic Network Analysis (INA) is defined by reference to the known crystal structures of olivine minerals. It is based on a reversible transformation between two alternative representations of ionic crystal structures: ( a ) the crystallographic and ( b ) the interactional. Whereas the former encompasses unit-cell parameters and atomic coordinates, the latter consists of selected interaction vectors between ions. Since the lengths and orientations of these vary only slightly between crystal structures obtained under systematically varying ( p , T , X ) conditions, they may be used to predict the crystal structures at intermediate ( p , T , X ) values by interpolation. Two interactional networks are constructed, one for the anions and the other for cations. As both networks lead to independent calculated values of the unit-cell parameters, it is possible to exploit the known, continuous ( p , T , X ) variations of cell parameters as normative constraints for the prediction of atomic coordinates within a predictive structural refinement procedure. Continuously varying structurally based parameters such as the volumes of cation coordination polyhedra may likewise be used. The choice of olivines for developing the method has been guided by the availability of pressure, temperature and compositional structural data for them. However, the ideas are expounded sufficiently generally for the method to be applied to other minerals.",

The re-crystallization of (1S) in toluene at 277 K resulted in a concomitant formation of a solvent-free polymorph, Co II(3,5-DBSQ) 2(DBPy) 2 (1). Thermally induced valence tautomerism (VT) is observed only in (1S), (1) and (2S) [hs-Co II(3,5-DBSQ) 2L 2 ↔ ls-Co III(3,5-DBSQ)(3,5-DBCat)L 2 (hs = high spin, ls = low spin, 3,5-DBCat = 3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholate)], whereas (3) and (4) remain locked in the hs-Co II(3,5-DBSQ) 2 state during cooling of the sample. Multi-temperature single-crystal studies demonstrate the change in cobalt coordination environment during the VT conversion. The non-solvated compound (1) shows a sharp VT transition (T 1/2 ~ 245 K with ΔT ~ 10 K) from hs-Co II(3,5-DBSQ) 2(DBPy) 2 to ls-Co III(3,5-DBSQ)(3,5-DBCat)(DBPy) 2 oxidation state, whereas the other polymorph with lattice solvent (1S) results in a broad transition (T 1/2 ~ 150 K with ΔT ~ 100 K). This increase in the VT transition temperature for (1) relative to (1S) illustrates the effect of lattice solvent on the VT transition mechanism. Additionally, the influence of halogen substitutions on the pyridine ring is discussed with respect to observed VT behaviour in the studied compounds. Thermal valence tautomerism in the cobalt-bis(dioxolene) molecular complexes is evaluated using variable-temperature crystal structure studies. In the present study, the effects of lattice solvent and substitution of halogens on the pyridine ligand to the valence tautomerism are demonstrated in cobalt bis(dioxolene) molecular complexes.",

For the refinement of a superspace model in the superspace group Pbam (α0½)0 ss different scale factors for main and satellite reflections were used in order to describe an ordered mullite structure embedded in a disordered polymorph. The ordered fraction of the mullite sample exhibits a completely ordered vacancy distribution and can be described as a block structure of vacancy blocks (VBs) that alternate with vacancy-free blocks (VFBs) along a and c . The incommensurate nature of mullite originates from a modulation of the block size, which depends on the composition. The displacive modulation is analyzed with respect to the vacancy distribution and a possible Al/Si ordering scheme is derived, although the measurement itself is not sensitive to the Al/Si distribution. An idealized, commensurate approximation for 2/1 mullite is also presented. Comparison of the ordered superspace model with different preceding models reconciles many key investigations of the last decades with partly contradicting conclusions, where mullite was usually treated as either ordered or disordered instead of considering simultaneously different states of order.",

The density calculated using the empirical formula is 3.903 g cm −3 . The crystal structure was refined to R = 0.0217 for 776 reflections with I &gt; 2σ( I ). OH-Gad is isostructural with gadolinite-(Y) and it is characterized by the predominance of OH − over O 2− at the anionic Ø-site.

The possible orientation and local environment of the hydroxyl group were suggested based on bond-valence sum calculations and geometrical analysis of the crystal structure. The infrared spectrum confirms disordering of H atoms. OH-Gad seems to be a potentially new mineral, the first simultaneously hydroxyl- and iron-dominant member of the gadolinite subgroup.

The microparticles are characterized by optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, flow particle image analysis and particle charge density. X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigations showed that calcite polymorph content increased with an increase in crystallization time, even if the electrostatic interactions between Ca(2+) and polyanionic sites of P(NVP-MA-Ox) structure conduct to an increased vaterite phase stability. The strong particle size increase after 6 h of ageing can be ascribed to partially vaterite recrystallization and adsorption of nano-scaled calcite crystallite nuclei at microparticles surfaces. The pH stability of the particles was shown by zeta potential changes and their adsorption capacity as a function of their composition, and characteristics were tested using methylene blue. The sorption capacity of composite materials was strongly influenced by the ratio between polymorphs in the composites, and increased with the increase of calcite content and ageing time.",

The primary interaction between the acid and base happens via N—H...O hydrogen bonds in (II) and (III), and via water-mediated N—H...O W and O W —H W ...S in (I). The water molecules present in compound (I) form a (H 2 O) 12 water cluster via water–water interactions. In all three compounds (I)–(III), thiobarbiturate anions form self-complementary pairs with a robust R 2 2 (8) motif via a pair of N—H...O/N—H...S hydrogen bonds. They mimic the nucleobase base pairs by utilizing the same groups (thymine/uracil uses N3—H and C4=O8 groups during the formation of Watson–Crick and Hoogsteen base pairs with adenine). Compound (I) forms a water-mediated base pair through N—H...O W hydrogen bonds and forms an R 4 2 (12) motif. The formation of N—H...S hydrogen bonds, water-mediated base pairs and water–water interactions in these crystal systems offers scope for these systems to be considered as a model in the study of hydration of nucleobases and water-mediated nucleobase base pairs in macromolecules.",

There is a group–subgroup relationship linking (I)–(II), due to cell doubling and the disappearance of a number of symmetry operations. In addition to X-ray diffraction, the transition has been monitored by Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, the latter disclosing an enthalpy change of 0.72 (6) kJ mol −1 . Variations of the unit-cell parameters with temperature between 170 and 293 K are presented. The evolution of diffraction spots in the vicinity of the transition temperature shows the coexistence of both phases, confirming the first-order character of the transition. Structural details of both phases are analyzed and intermolecular interactions compared in order to investigate the mechanism of the phase transition.

The geometries of the VO 4 and VO 5 building units are rigid and it is mainly slight rotations of these polyhedra and small variation of the intermediate K—O distances that are modulated. Prolonged exposure to the high-brilliance synchrotron beam suppresses the incommensurate phase. The previously postulated phase transition to the incommensurate phase in Rb 2 V 3 O 8 at 270 K was not observed. One of the reasons could be that the intense radiation also affects the modulation in this material.

    "abstract": "Ultra-thin rare earth iron garnet (RIG) films with a narrow ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) line width and a low damping factor have attracted a great deal of attention for microwave and spintronic applications. In this work, 200 nm Y 3 (GaAlFe) 5 O 12 garnet (GaAl-YIG) films were prepared on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates by liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) with low saturation magnetization. The microstructural properties, chemical composition, and magnetostatic and dynamic magnetization characteristics of the films are discussed in detail. According to the structural analysis, these films exhibit a low surface roughness of less than 0.5 nm. The GaAl-YIG films show an obvious temperature dependence of lattice parameter and strain state, and the film's parameter is perfectly matched with that of the GGG substrate at 810°C. There is a clear variation in the Pb level, which brings about a gradual enhancement of the coercivity and a diminution of the squareness ratio of magnetic hysteresis loops as the growth temperature is reduced. Slight changes in surface roughness, strain condition and content of Pb induce the FMR line width and damping factor to vary on a small scale. The line width is less than 10.17 Oe at 12 GHz and the damping factor is of the order of 10 −4 . All these properties demonstrate that these ultra-thin GaAl-YIG films are of benefit for the development of devices operated at lower frequencies and in lower fields.",

Despite the small size of the single crystals and the weak diffraction, it was possible to determine the positions of the non-hydrogen atoms reliably.

    "abstract": "Like many complex intermetallic phases, the crystal structures of REZn 5+ x compounds (RE = lanthanide or Group 3 element) based on the EuMg 5 type have gradually unfolded. The original reports described a complex hexagonal structure with an unusual combination of tetrahedrally close-packed regions and open spaces, as well as observations of superstructure reflections. More recently, we reinvestigated the structure of YZn 5 , reclassifying it as the EuMg 5+ x -type compound YZn 5+ x ( x ≃ 0.2), in which disordered channels run along c through the spaces formerly considered open. In addition, DFT-chemical pressure (DFT-CP) analysis of ordered models of YZn 5+ x highlighted paths for communication between neighboring channels setting the stage for superstructure formation. Herein, the experimental elucidation of this effect is presented with the synthesis and structure determination of a modulated form of YZn 5+ x . By slow-cooling samples of YZn 5+ x from the annealing temperature, crystals were obtained that exhibit satellite reflections with the modulation wavevector q = {1\\over 3} a* + {1\\over 3} b* + 0.3041 c* . Structure solution and refinement using a (3+1)D model in superspace group P 3 1 c ({1\\over 3}\\,\\!{1\\over 3}σ 3 )00 s reveals incommensurate order in the structure's channels. Here, two Zn sites associated with the channels are present, each with discontinuous atomic domains that are slanted in the x 3 x 4 plane. Their slanting corresponds to adjustments along the c axis for the presence or absence of close neighbors along that axis, while the occupation patterns of neighboring channels are shifted by {1\\over 3} of the modulation period. These features follow earlier predictions from CP analysis, highlighting how this approach can be used predictively in search of new phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Spin-crossover (SCO) compounds are promising materials for a wide variety of industrial applications. However, the fundamental understanding of their nature of transition and its effect on the physical properties are still being fervently explored; the microscopic knowledge of their transition is essential for tailoring their properties. Here an attempt is made to correlate the changes in macroscopic physical properties with microscopic structural changes in the orthorhombic and monoclinic polymorphs of the SCO compound Fe(PM-Bia) 2 (NCS) 2 (PM = N -2′-pyridylmethylene and Bia = 4-aminobiphenyl) by employing single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetization and DSC measurements. The dependence of macroscopic properties on cooperativity, highlighting the role of hydrogen bonding, π–π and van der Waals interactions is discussed. Values of entropy, enthalpy and cooperativity are calculated numerically based on the Slichter–Drickamer model. The particle size dependence of the magnetic properties is probed along with the thermal exchange and the kinetic behavior of the two polymorphs based on the dependence of magnetization on temperature scan rate and a theoretical model is proposed for the calculation of the non-equilibrium spin-phase fraction. Also a scan-rate-dependent two-step behavior observed for the orthorhombic polymorph, which is absent for the monoclinic polymorph, is reported. Moreover, it is found that the radiation dose from synchrotron radiation affects the spin-crossover process and shifts the transition region to lower temperatures, implying that the spin crossover can be tuned with radiation damage.",

This fact allows one to consider experimentally obtained helices as periodic approximants of helices from the four-dimensional {3, 3, 5} polytope and its derivative constructions. For the tetrahedral Coxeter–Boerdijk helix (tetrahelix) with a 30/11 axis from the {3, 3, 5} polytope, approximants with 11/4 and 8/3 axes in three-dimensional Euclidean space {\\bb E}^{3} are considered. These determine the structure of rods composed of deformed tetrahedra in close-packed crystals of α-Mn and β-Mn. In the {3, 3, 5} polytope, highlighted here for the first time, is a 40-vertex helix with a 20/9 axis composed of seven-vertex quadruples of tetrahedra (tetrablocks), whose 7/3 approximants determine in a crystal of an α-Mn rod of deformed tetrablocks with the same period as the 11/4 approximant of the tetrahelix. In the spaces of the three-dimensional sphere and {\\bb E}^{3}, the parameters of 20/9, 40/9 and 40/11 helices, as well as of their 20- and 40-vertex approximants, are calculated. The parameters of the approximant of the 40/11 helix in {\\bb E}^{3} correspond to experimentally determined parameters of the α-helix, which allows us to explain the versatility of the α-helix in proteins by the symmetry of the polytope. The set of fractional axes of all periodic approximants of helices with 30/11, 20/9, 40/9, 40/11 axes, as well as the powers of these axes, are combined into a tetrahedral-polytope class of 50 basic axes.

    "abstract": "The role of different intermolecular interactions in the crystal structures of halogen-substituted indoles which are fused with six-membered or seven-membered cyclic rings is investigated here. Several crystal structures show isostructural characteristics due to the presence of similar supramolecular motifs. In the absence of any strong hydrogen bonds, the molecular packing of reported structures is primarily stabilized by the presence of non-classical N—H...π and C—H...π interactions in addition to C—H... X ( X = F/Cl/Br) interactions. The nature and energetics of primary and secondary dimeric motifs are partitioned into the electrostatics, polarization, dispersion and exchange–repulsion components using the PIXEL method. Short and directional N—H...π interactions are further explored by a topological analysis of the electron density based on quantum theory of atoms in molecules.",

    "abstract": "Two novel definitions of chemical coordination numbers – valence entropy coordination number n VECN and valence diversity coordination number n VDCN – are proposed. Their originality stems from the fact that they are the first definitions based solely on bond valences. The expressions for them are derived from their definitions and their properties are studied. The unexpected close relationship of n VECN to Shannon entropy and n VDCN to diversity are revealed and the names of the new coordination numbers are taken therefrom. Finally, as an example, a study of arsenic(III) lone electron pair stereoactivity with respect to As III coordination number is carried out to demonstrate the usefulness and advantages of the new definitions as well as to compare them with the existing ones.",

The structure refinement of petzite reported long ago [Frueh (1959). Am. Mineral. 44 , 693–701] did not provide any information about the absolute structure. A new single-crystal X-ray diffraction refinement has now been performed on a sample from Lake View Mine, Golden Mile, Kalgoorlie, Australia, which has resulted in a reliable absolute structure [a Flack parameter of 0.05 (3)], although this corresponds to the opposite enantiomorph reported previously. The minimum Te–Te distance is 3.767 (3) Å, slightly shorter than the van der Waals bonding distance, which suggests a weak interaction between the two chalcogens. XANES spectra near the Au and Te L III edges suggest that the chemical-bonding character of Au in petzite is more metallic than in other gold minerals.",

    "abstract": "The interactions of nucleic acid bases with non-coordinated and coordinated water molecules were studied by analyzing data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and by quantum chemical calculations. The analysis of the data in the crystal structures from the PDB indicates that hydrogen bonds involving oxygen or nitrogen atoms of nucleic acid bases and water molecules are shorter when water is bonded to a metal ion. These results are in agreement with the quantum chemical calculations on geometries and interaction energies of hydrogen bonds; the calculations on model systems show that hydrogen bonds of nucleic acid bases with water bonded to a metal ion are stronger than hydrogen bonds with non-coordinated water. These calculated values are similar to the strength of hydrogen bonds between nucleic acid bases. The results presented in this paper may be relevant to understand the role of water molecules and metal ions in the process of replication and stabilization of nucleic acids and also to understand the possible toxicity of metal ion interactions with nucleic acids.",

HT iron oxidation associated with dehydroxylation starts at 450°C, similar to other ferrous-hydroxy-rich heterophyllosilicates such as astrophyllite and bafertisite. A prominent feature of lobanovite HT crystal chemistry is the redistribution of Fe and Mg+Mn cations over the M(2), M(3), M(4) sites of the octahedral (O) layer that accompanies iron oxidation and dehydroxylation. This HT redistribution of cations has not been observed in titanosilicates until now, and seems to be triggered by the need to maintain bond strengths at the apical oxygen atom of the TiO5 pyramid in the heteropolyhedral (H) layer during oxidation-dehydroxylation. Comparison of the HT behaviour of lobanovite with five-coordinated Ti and astrophyllite with six-coordinated Ti shows that the geometry of the Ti polyhedron plays a key role in the HT behaviour of heterophyllosilicates. The thermal expansion, geometrical changes and redistribution of site occupancies which occur in lobanovite under increasing temperature are reported. A brief discussion is given of minerals in which the cation ordering (usually for Fe and Mg) occurs together with iron oxidation-dehydroxylation at elevated temperatures: micas, amphiboles and tourmalines. Now this list is expanded by the inclusion of titanosilicate minerals.",

Novel salts of clofazimine are reported with fumaric, succinic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic and terephthalic acids and with saccharin. The salt structures were obtained by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The salts with 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and with saccharin are solvated (methanol and acetonitrile, respectively). The reaction of clofazimine with terephthalic acid led to two salt cocrystals, one solvated and one non-solvated. These new clofaziminium salts are compared with the currently known ones in terms of crystal packing and clofazimine/ium conformation. Clofaziminium hydrogen succinate presents isostructurality with clofaziminium hydrogen malonate, an already described salt. In the structure of clofaziminium terephthalate terephthalic acid salt cocrystal, solvent evaporation leads to packing and hydrogen-bonding modifications. In all the new structures, the clofaziminium conformation is quite well conserved and steric hindrance is observed around the protonated site. Conformational optimization of clofaziminium reveals that this steric-hindrance energy penalty is compensated for by hydrogen-bond interactions with the salt counter-ions.",

Topological analysis of the electron density shows the charge concentration/depletion of hippuric acid bonds in the crystal structure. Electrostatic parameters such as atomic charges and dipole moments were calculated. The mapping of atomic basins and the calculation of respective charges show the atomic volumes of each atom as well as their charge contributions in the hippuric acid crystal structure. The dipole-moment calculations show that the molecule is very polar in nature. Calculations of the electrostatic potential show that the chain part of the molecule has a higher concentration of negative charge than the ring, which might be instrumental in its strong binding with the polar residues of site II of human serum albumin.",

The title compound in centrosymmetric space group Cmcm contains dimers of two ScO 6 octahedra sharing corners with three bridging WO 4 tetrahedra. Three pairs of opposite terminal WO 4 tetrahedra are additionally linked by AgO 2 dumbbells to form {Ag 3 [Sc 2 (WO 4 ) 9 ]} 9− groups, which together with some rubidium ions are packed in pseudohexagonal glaserite-like layers parallel to (001), but stacking of the layers is different in these three structures. In the title structure, the layers stack with a shift along the b axis and their interlayer space contains disordered Rb + cations partially substituted by Ag + ions. Almost linear chains of incompletely filled close Rb3a–Rb3d positions (the shortest distances Rb–Rb are 0.46 to 0.64 Å) are found to locate approximately along the b axis. This positional disorder and the presence of wide common quadrangular faces of Rb2 and Rb3a–Rb3d coordination polyhedra favor two-dimensional ionic conductivity in the (001) plane with Rb + and Ag + carriers, which was confirmed with bond valence sum (BVS) maps. Electrical conductivity measurements on Rb 9 Ag 3 Sc 2 (WO 4 ) 9 ceramics revealed a first-order superionic phase transition at 570 K with a sharp increase in the electrical conductivity.

    "abstract": "In his article, Krivovichev (2020) examines the emerging class of polyoxometalatebearing minerals and the origins of their unusual complexity in terms of information content.The 42 minerals in this class constitute less than 1% of recognized mineral species, but their descriptions mostly require the current generation of X-ray diffractometers, and it is likely that many more will be discovered by new mineral hunters in the future.Indeed, this is a rapidly growing class with 34 (81%) of its species described within the past two decades.The average complexity of mineral crystal structures is about 220 bits per unit cell, and all 42 polyoxometalate-bearing minerals exhibit much higher than average complexity owing to the presence of nanoscale metal oxide clusters in their structures.The information content of the most complex of these, the uranyl carbonate ewingite, is more than 100 times higher than average.The structure of ewingite is also the most complex known mineral structure.In 1783, Carl Wilhelm Scheele provided the first surviving written report of blue waters in the Idaho Springs (USA) region, but undoubtedly these had been observed previously.The blue waters are thought to be colored by soluble molybdenum oxide clusters (Mo 3 O 8 ÁnH 2 O) that crystallize as ilsemannite (and related species), which was first described in 1871.The mineral is inadequately characterized even today, in part because of its poor crystallinity and likely corresponds to several different species containing a variety of molybdenum oxide clusters that are examples of natural polyoxometalates.Dissolution of so-called ilsemannite in water produces a greenish-blue solution that later deepens to a typical molybdenum blue.Under the right conditions, metal oxide clusters spontaneously self-assemble in aqueous solution.These anionic clusters can contain several hundred atoms and have dimensions ranging up to several nanometres.These have been extensively studied by inorganic chemists, who have revealed the impressive range in cluster structures and compositions.Owing to their lower charge densities and well defined structures, metal oxide clusters behave very differently in solution than simpler metal-bearing species, and high solubility is a hallmark of such clusters.There are many potential and realized applications of metal oxide clusters, and they are excellent model systems for studying structure-composition-size-property relations.Differences in chemical bonding distinguish self-assembling metal oxide clusters in aqueous solutions that persist at the nanoscale, as compared to nucleation of nanoscale clusters that continue to grow and become crystals.Polyoxometalates are generally defined as the class of metal oxide clusters that contain multiple bonds between metal cations and oxygen.Such bonds are common in the case of d 0 transition metals of groups V (V 5+ , Nb 5+ , Ta 5+ ) and VI (Mo 6+ , W 6+ ), as well as the actinides U, Np and Pu in their pentavalent and hexavalent oxidation states.The doubly or triply bonded oxygen atoms tend not to bridge to other metal centers and instead serve to stabilize the surface of the polyoxometalate.As such, polyoxometalates are inherently nanoscale materials and they have no macroscale analogs.Other types of nanoscale metal oxide clusters have surfaces that are stabilized by different chemical features, including protonation of oxygen atoms and capping by organic ligands.Synthetic transition metal and actinide-based polyoxometalates have been extensively studied both in solution and the solid state.These clusters have been definitively",

Grain misorientation analysis has shown that about one third of all grains contain {101} twin boundaries (TBs). The majority of these grains are contact twins, whereas a small fraction of grains are multiple, mainly cyclic twins. A procedure was developed in MTEX [Bachmann, Hielscher &amp; Schaeben (2010). Solid State Phenom. 160 , 63–88] for automated identification of crystallographically different types of cyclic twins and found two main types: coplanar twins composed of three or four domains with a common [010] axis and alternating twins composed of three to seven domains oriented along the [111] axis. Both types of cyclic twins have a characteristic common origin (nucleus) of all TBs, which is positioned eccentric relative to the grain section and the cycle is closed with a shorter non-crystallographic contact between the first and the last twin domain. The morphology of cyclic twins suggests that they form by nucleation in the initial stages of grain growth. The average size of twinned grains increases with the number of twin domains indicating the influence of TBs formation on the growth of composite grains.",

    "abstract": "Two distinct approaches, that of energy and that of force , are adopted in quantum mechanics to get insights on chemical processes. In the second one, the net forces acting on the electrons and nuclei in a system (Ehrnefest and Hellmann–Feynman forces, respectively) are determined and a local version of the approach, in terms of force density fields rather than forces, has also been proposed for electrons. This is the path followed by Tsirelson &amp; Stash (2020) in this issue of Acta Crystallographica Section B , to study for the first time the spatial distribution of the electronic forces of different nature acting in stable crystals. Interestingly, by relying on approximations taken from orbital-free DFT, all components of the inner-crystal force can be easily retrieved from multipole-model refined experimental electron densities and their derivatives. No less important is that these calculations are becoming easily doable for any X-ray density crystallographer thanks to a new version of the computer program WinXPRO , purposely developed in the study which is discussed in this commentary.",

    "abstract": "NaSICON (Na Super-Ionic CONducting) structured materials are among the most promising solid electrolytes for Li-ion batteries and `beyond Li-ion' batteries ( e.g. Na and K) due to their superior ionic conductivities. Although this material has been well known for decades, its exact phase behaviour is still poorly understood. Herein, a starting material of Na 3 Sc 2 (PO 4 ) 3 single crystals is used, grown by flux methodology, where Na is subsequently chemically replaced by Ag, in order to take advantage of the higher scattering contrast of Ag. It is found that the NaSICON-type compound shows two phase transitions from a low-temperature monoclinic α-phase to a monoclinic β-phase at about 180 K and to a rhombohedral γ-phase at about 290 K. The framework of [Sc 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ] 3− is rigid and does not change significantly with temperature and change of symmetry. The main driving force for the phase transitions is related to order–disorder phenomena of the conducting cations. The sensitivity of the phase behaviour on the ordering of these ions suggests that small compositional changes can have a great impact on the phase behaviour and, hence, on the ionic conductivity of NaSICON-structured materials.",

The pyridonate O atom bridges two or three metal ions in each case. Nitrogen is also involved in coordination to the heavier metals; it bonds to a single ion in (3) and (4), but has an almost unprecedented bridging role in (5) and (6). As a result of the extensive bridging by ligands, coordination numbers between 6 and 8 are achieved for the metal ions. In each structure, all solvent OH groups form hydrogen bonds to pyridonate O and, in some cases, N atoms.

Crystal structure analysis of the monoclinic phase III shows an increase of proton ordering with decreasing temperature in the (SO4)H(SO4) dimer. Moreover, the NH4(+) groups on a general position begin ordering in this phase. The monoclinic unit cell of TAHS-IV doubles in the b direction and a slight distortion of SO4(2-) and NH4(+) tetrahedra is observed. The order parameter introduced by Landau was determined for the second-order II/III and III/IV phase transitions from the intensities of the superstructure reflections. TAHS-V has a triclinic space group and the crystal structure seems to be completely ordered according to a structure analysis by single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. In addition, the decisive role of the dynamical disorder of different ammonium groups on successive phase transitions is discussed. Additional peaks were observed by X-ray powder diffraction measurements at ∼ 70 K on cooling, which refers to the V/VII phase transition. These additional peaks remained up to ∼ 85 K on heating. They were described with a doubling of the unit cell along all three principal crystallographic directions.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphism in Molecular Crystals which the late Professor Bernstein wrote in 2002.This second edition describes major progress in the understanding of polymorphism, from the experimental procedures to show this important property, to applications in fundamental crystallography, structure-properties relationships, material sciences and pharmacology.Many well selected examples are discussed which guide a new researcher into the field.It is also a fantastic source of historical, fundamental and up to date papers and reviews (110 pages of references).This book then can be read by a beginner in the field but also by an active researcher in polymorphism, crystal engineering or crystal chemistry.The author took care to allow the reader to go directly to the information with a well documented index.Even if it is not defined like that by J. Bernstein, this book is divided into five parts: the first part (chapters 1 to 5) is devoted to fundamentals, analytical and modelling techniques, followed by one general chapter entitled Polymorphism and Structure-Property relations.Then comes the applications to pharmaceuticals, pigments and dyes, highenergy materials.The book ends with the important topic of polymorphism and patents.Some comments on chapters: Chapter 2 Fundamentals.This chapter is very chemistry oriented: this is understandable, but some physics about phase transitions could have been useful.Many figures have been reproduced from papers or reviews but sometimes the legends or/and the corresponding text do not help for fully understanding the information of the figure (for example, Figures 2.4 to 2.8).Chapter 3 Exploring the crystal landscape describes the challenge to discover and control the characterizing polymorphism (including disappearing polymorphs) from a thermodynamic and kinetic point of view.Paragraphs on solvent choice, non-traditional techniques and high throughput are especially interesting.Chapter 4 Analytical Techniques: the most relevant techniques and methods to characterize polymorphs are described: not extensively (it is not the aim of the book) for the usual ones such as X-ray powder or single-crystal diffraction, thermal methods, NMR, IR, Raman spectroscopies, microscopies, but enough to understand which technique should be used for which characterization.The section on optical hot-stage microscopy is very informative.The combination of X-ray diffraction with other methods, such as timeresolved diffraction are also introduced; these new methods (not technologies as written in the book) should have been more developed.Chapter 5 Computational aspects.First a thorough discussion on conformational polymorphs is given, then methods to calculate ÁU and ÁG are proposed with selected examples.The chapter on prediction of polymorphs describes very honestly all blind tests made in collaboration with the Cambridge Structural Database.A large chapter is devoted to Hirshfeld surfaces, which in my opinion, is too long as most information given by Hirshfeld surfaces can be retrieved quantitatively not qualitatively from critical inspection of intermolecular distances and angles.A paragraph on the experimental analysis of the molecular interactions using Bader's Atoms in Molecules theory from high-resolution X-ray diffraction results and/or DFT would have been welcome.",

Imidazolium in salts with dicarboxylic acids have been found to have a well ordered hydrogen-bond network and only in Im-MAL [Pogorzelec-Glaser et al. (2006). Mater. Sci.-Pol. (2006), 24 , 245–252] were two types of cation observed: ordered Im-I and disordered Im-II. Im-I is involved in hydrogen bonds with malonic acid molecules, whereas Im-II is disordered between two symmetrically equivalent positions with occupancy of 0.5. NMR studies by Mizuno et al. [ Hyperfine Interact. (2015), 230 , 95–100] showed an 180° flip of ordered Im-I and calculated contribution of Im-I flipping to proton conductivity of Im-MAL. Ławniczak et al. [ Solid State Ionics (2017), 306 , 25] reported that temperature variation of the proton conductivity by impedance spectroscopy yielded the conductivity value higher than that calculated by Mizuno for Im-I. Moreover these detailed structure studies at 240 K and 280 K excluded any phase transition. Repeated X-ray studies from 14 K to 360 K show a continuous increase in anisotropic displacement factors. The half-occupied hydrogen bonds linking the Im-II nitrogen atoms with hydroxyl oxygen atoms may be considered as electric dipoles and the interbond proton transfer as dipolar switching. It assumed here a coherent switching at low temperatures and a decrease of the coupling at higher temperatures with the disappearance at cross-over temperature at 318 K. The possible proton pathway in the crystal structure is determined and the contribution of the proton dynamics of Im-II to phonon-assisted proton diffusion in the ordered substructure is estimated.",

After separation and purification, acetone is used as a solvent to obtain light-yellow crystals at room temperature. The molecular structure of cis -HNS is determined through analysis of Fourier transform infrared, 13 C NMR and 1 H NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. The thermal decomposition properties of cis and trans -HNS are studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). When the heating rate is low, cis -HNS will undergo a crystal transformation after melting, from liquid cis -HNS to liquid trans -HNS, and then it will solidify and release heat.

The N atoms of the putrescine(2+) dication form three direct hydrogen bonds with the N7_G atoms of three different Z-DNA molecules, plus three water-mediated hydrogen bonds with cytosine, guanine and phosphate acceptors. A unique potassium cation was also unambiguously identified in the structure, albeit at a ∼0.5 occupation site shared with a water molecule, providing the first example of such a complex with Z-DNA. The K + cation has coordination number of eight and an irregular coordination sphere, formed by four water molecules and four O atoms from two phosphate groups of the Z-DNA, including ligands present at fractional occupancy. The structural disorder of the Z-DNA duplex is manifested by the presence of alternate conformations along the DNA backbone. Comparison of the position and interactions of putrescine(2+) in the present structure with other ultra-high-resolution structures of Z-DNA in complexes with Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ ions shows that the dicationic putrescinium moiety can effectively substitute these metal ions for stabilization of Z-type DNA duplexes.

To elucidate the mechanism of this process, a series of experiments were conducted in which a dilute polymer solution was sprayed onto a mica substrate to form a single-crystal film through liquid gating technology to study the effect of the crystallization time on the morphology of a thiol PEO (mPEO-SH) crystal.

A new salt of 1 H -pyrazole-1-carboxamidine, (HPyCA)NO 3 , for guanylation reaction was obtained in a crystalline form. The compound crystallizes in monoclinic space group P 2 1 / c and a phase transition at 174 K to triclinic modification P 1 was found. An unusual increase of the unit-cell volume was observed just after transition. Although the volume decreases upon cooling, it remains higher down to 160 K in comparison to the unit-cell volume of phase (I). The mechanism of the phase transition is connected with a minor movement of the nitrate anions. The triclinic phase was unreachable at room-temperature high-pressure conditions up to 1.27 GPa. On further compression, delamination of the crystal was observed. Phase (I) exhibits negative linear compressibility, whereas abnormal behaviour of the b unit-cell parameter upon cooling was observed, indicating negative thermal linear expansion. The unusual nature of the compound is associated with the two-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network, which is less susceptible to deformation than stacking interactions connecting the layers of hydrogen bonds. Infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry measurements were used to investigate the changes of intermolecular interactions during the phase transition.",

This paper presents models of the local order of polymorphs (I) and (II), and compares the single-crystal diffuse scattering (SCDS) computed from the models with that observed from real crystals. TPA shows relatively weak and less-structured diffuse scattering than some other polymorphic materials, but it does appear that the SCDS is less well modelled by a purely harmonic model in polymorph (I) than in polymorph (II), according to the idea that the diffuse scattering is sensitive to anharmonicity that presages a structural phase transition. The work here verifies that displacive correlations are strong along the molecular chains and weak laterally, and that it is not necessary to allow the —COOH groups to librate to successfully model the diffuse scattering – keeping in mind that the data are from X-ray diffraction and not directly sensitive to H atoms.",

The three-dimensional X-ray crystal structures of (1) at the low-temperature phase (LTP) (100, 140 and 142 K) and the high-temperature phase (HTP) (143, 150, 200, 250 and 300 K) were solved and refined as a simple non-disordered model with final R[F2 > 2σ(F2)] ≃ 0.05. The asymmetric unit of (1) consists of crystallographically independent 4-methoxybenzoic acid (A) and isonicotinamide (B) molecules in both enantiotropic phases. Molecule A adopts a `near-hydroxyl' conformation in which the hydroxyl and methoxy groups are positioned on the same side. Both `near-hydroxyl' and `near-carbonyl' molecular conformations possess minimum conformational energies with an energy difference of < 0.15 kJ mol-1 from a potential energy surface scan. In the crystal, molecules are joined into linear ABBA arrays by intermolecular N-H...O and O-H...N hydrogen bonds which were preserved in both phases. However, these ABBA arrays are displaced from planarity upon LTP-to-HTP transition and the changes in inter-array interactions are observed in two-dimensional fingerprint plots of their Hirshfeld surfaces. The PIXEL energies of each molecular pair in both phases were calculated to investigate the difference in intermolecular interaction energies before and after the displacement of ABBA arrays from planarity, which directly leads to the single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase transition of (1).",

This calculated superposition structure agrees excellently with an (incomplete) experimental structure determined from single-crystal data. From the optimized ordered models, the stacking probabilities and the preferred local arrangements were derived.

The most interesting feature is the presence of a moderate though still strong O—H...N/O...H—N hydrogen bond. Its bridging H atom was found to be disordered over two positions in the temperature interval 290–220 K, with the larger occupation towards the O atom. The occupation in the latter position decreased with decreasing temperature, though not monotonously. At 210 K and below, the difference electron-density maps showed just one maximum which was closer to the N atom. Though difference scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed no anomaly in the interval 303–93 K, the dependence of the length of the unit-cell axes b and c on temperature showed a kink in the slope at about 190 K. The N...O distance of the mentioned hydrogen bond or the occupational parameter of the electron density of the disordered H atom indicate less pronounced anomalies for the temperatures 270 and 230 K. The cation and the anion, as well as the water molecules, form layers which are parallel to (10\\overline{1}) and which are interconnected by O—H...N (in the interval 290–220 K), N—H...O and O—H...O hydrogen bonds of moderate strength. The layers are arranged into centrosymmetric double layers in which the F atoms are directed outwards. The layers are interconnected by water–acid O—H...O hydrogen bonds, weak N—H...F interactions and π-electron ring...π-electron ring interactions. The dependence of P—F bond lengths on bonding properties of the trioxofluorophosphate or hydrogen trioxofluorophosphate anions is discussed. It has been recognized that a carbon-bonded F atom avoids participation in a hydrogen-bond pattern; however, this property seems to be also common to fluorine bonded to P, As and S, especially if an oxygen ligand is also present in a molecule. The deposited material contains an overview of the determined structures with trioxofluorophosphate or hydrogen trioxofluorophosphate anions.",

Crystals were grown at either 0.05 or 0.20 mm min-1. The hypothesis is that multicomponent compounds with large AIR will form secondary phases as the single-RE aluminum garnets formed by larger Tb3+ or Gd3+; this will result in crystals of poor optical quality. Crystals with large AIR have a central opaque region in optical microscopy images, which is responsible for their reduced transparency compared to crystals with small AIR. Slow pulling rates suppress the formation of the opaque region in crystals with intermediate AIR. Powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction and electron probe microanalysis results indicate that the opaque region is a perovskite phase. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy measurements reveal eutectic inclusions at the outer surface of the crystals.

Using high-resolution neutron powder diffraction data, the crystal structure of α-ammonium carbamate (ND 4 ·ND 2 CO 2 ) has been refined [space group Pbca , Z = 8, with a = 17.05189 (15), b = 6.43531 (7), c = 6.68093 (7) Å and V = 733.126 (9) Å 3 at 4.2 K] and the thermal expansivity of α-ammonium carbamate has been measured over the temperature range 4.2–180 K. The expansivity shows a high degree of anisotropy, with the b axis most expandable. The ab initio computational studies were carried out on the α- and β-polymorphs of ammonium carbamate using density functional theory. Fitting equations of state to the P ( V ) points of the simulations (run athermally) gave the following values: V 0 = 744 (2) Å 3 and bulk modulus K 0 = 16.5 (4) GPa for the α-polymorph, and V 0 = 713.6 (5) Å 3 and K 0 = 24.4 (4) GPa for the β-polymorph. The simulations show good agreement with the thermoelastic behaviour of α-ammonium carbamate. Both phases show a high-degree of anisotropy; in particular, α-ammonium carbamate shows unusual compressive behaviour, being determined to have negative linear compressibility (NLC) along its a axis above 5 GPa. The thermodynamically stable phase at ambient pressure is the α-polymorph, with a calculated enthalpy difference with respect to the β-polymorph of 0.399 kJ mol −1 ; a transition to the β-polymorph could occur at ∼0.4 GPa.",

Ab initio calculations model thermal motion within a harmonic or sometimes quasi-harmonic approximation and must be complimented by experimental data on temperature-dependent vibrational frequencies. Here multi-temperature atomic displacement parameters (ADPs), derived from a single-crystal synchrotron diffraction experiment, are used to characterize low-frequency lattice vibrations in the α-FOX-7 layered structure. It is shown that despite the limited quality of the data, the extracted frequencies are reasonably close to those derived from inelastic scattering, Raman measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Vibrational anharmonicity is parameterized by the Grüneisen parameters, which are found to be very different for in-layer and out-of-layer vibrations.",

Using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and lattice dynamical calculations, we show that the observed diffuse scattering is well described in terms of (i) non-statistical anion distributions, (ii) local lattice relaxations accompanying Cl/Br substitution, and (iii) the contribution from low-energy phonons. It is found that a tendency for compositional domain formation broadens the thermal diffuse scattering by splitting and softening the acoustic phonon branches. This effect, which is strongest for intermediate compositions, is seen in both experiment and calculation alike. These results establish a link between local compositional order and unconventional lattice dynamics in this system, and reinforce emerging design principles of exploiting compositional fluctuations to tailor physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, that depend on phonon broadening.",

The effect of pressure on the hydrogen bonds linking the H 2 PO 3 tetrahedra into zigzag chains along the c axis was different from that on the hydrogen bonds connecting the glycinium cations with the H 2 PO 3 tetrahedra in the ( b × c ) plane. The discontinuous changes in the geometries of selected hydrogen bonds at about 1.21 GPa may be evidence of a phase transition, e.g. into an ordered ferroelectric phase (with ordered positions of protons).

All of these coformers are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) molecules. The five reported crystal structures are sustained predominantly by intermolecular N + −H...O − , N—H...O − and N—H...O hydrogen-bonding interactions; in addition intramolecular O—H...O and intermolecular O—H...O, O—H...O − and C—H...O interactions contribute to the formation of various networks. Five 1:1 salts [NH 2 C 6 H 4 NH 3 ] + ·[COOHC 6 H 4 COO] − (1); [NH 2 C 6 H 4 NH 3 ] + ·[OHC 6 H 4 COO] − (2); [{NH 2 C 6 H 4 NH 2 } 2 ·{OHC 6 H 4 COOH} 2 ·{NH 2 C 6 H 4 NH 3 } + 2 ·{OHC 6 H 4 COO} − 2 ] (OPDPHB) (3); [NH 2 C 6 H 4 NH 3 ] + ·[NO 2 C 6 H 4 COO] − (4) and [NH 2 C 6 H 4 NH 3 ] + ·[(NO 2 ) 2 C 6 H 4 COO] − (5) were isolated as single crystals by the slow evaporation method and were characterized using spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic techniques. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the formation of salts. The p K a difference between the amine and respective acid favours the transfer of a proton from the acid to the amine, which leads to the formation of the anion and the cation. The interactions between these ions resulted in a stable heterosynthon in each case. The asymmetric units of salts (1), (2), (4) and (5) contain one anion and one cation each, but salt (3) consists of two anions, two cations and two neutral species in its asymmetric unit. A polymorph of salt (3) was also isolated from the crystallization of the ground material from liquid-assisted grinding [{NH 2 C 6 H 4 NH 2 }·{NH 2 C 6 H 4 NH 3 } + ·{OHC 6 H 4 COO} − ] (OPDPHB 3P). The polymorph crystallized in the monoclinic non-centrosymmetric space group P 2 1 . The liquid-assisted grinding experiments using a 1:1 ratio also revealed the formation of the expected salts, except salt (3), where this product matches with polymorph (OPDPHB 3P).",

A mimic was synthesized by preserving the main molecular functionalities responsible for creating the most probable structural arrangements in the solid state. Calculated molecular electrostatic potentials on both erlotinib and the mimic showed very comparable values indicating that the latter would be able to form hydrogen bonds of similar probability and strength as those of erlotinib. In order to establish the binding preference in co-crystallization experiments, the mimic molecule was co-crystallized with US Food and Drug Administration approved dicarboxylic acids. The crystal structures of the mimic and of four co-crystals thereof were obtained. The mimic forms hydrogen bonds in a way that closely resembles those found in the crystal structure of erlotinib. The four co-crystals display self-consistent hydrogen-bond interactions. Thermal and solubility data for the co-crystals demonstrate that by making systematic and controllable changes to the solid forms of the mimic, it is also possible to alter the behaviour and properties of the new solid forms. The use of a suitable structural mimic can allow for a systematic structural examination of a compound that is otherwise not amenable to such investigations by facilitating the elucidation and mapping out of a closely related structural landscape.",

    "abstract": "The structure factors of diamond were determined by synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction at 800 K at sin θ/λ ≤ 2.2 Å −1 reciprocal resolution. The structure factors were estimated using six powder profiles measured on beamline BL02B2 at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). A high reciprocal resolution at sin θ/λ ≤ 2.2 Å −1 was required to reveal the temperature dependence of the charge density, due to the high Debye temperature of θ D = 1860 K of diamond. Wide 2θ angle data with the highest counting statistics are crucial for accurate data analysis. The periodic noise of every six-pixel step was observed in the highest counting statistics imaging plate (IP) data scanned by a BAS2500 IP scanner. It was found that the noise originated from the six-sided polygonal mirror in the scanner. The intensity fluctuation at every six-pixel step was also found in the Fourier series expansion of the powder profiles. The ratio of the maximum fluctuation was estimated as 0.4% by summing all six-pixel step data. The powder profiles were corrected by multiplying the ratios. The intensity fluctuation in the background region was reduced to less than 50% of the uncorrected data. The weak 888 Bragg reflection, with an intensity of 0.005% of that of the 111 Bragg reflection at 800 K, was readily observed in the corrected data. Finally, the structure factors determined at 800 K were successfully applied to a charge-density study by multipole modelling. The reliability factors and multipole parameters at 800 K are in agreement with those at 300 K. The differences in the charge density at the bond midpoint and ∇ 2 ρ at the bond-critical point were less than 1% and 2%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "A mechanism is proposed for the nucleus formation at the mutual transformation of austenite and cementite crystals. The mechanism is founded on the interpretation of the considered structures as crystallographic tiling onto non-intersecting rods of triangulated polyhedra. A 15-vertex fragment of this linear substructure of austenite (cementite) can be transformed by diagonal flipping in a rhombus consisting of two adjacent triangular faces into a 15-vertex fragment of cementite (austenite). In the case of the mutual austenite–cementite transformation, the mutual orientation of the initial and final fragments coincides with the Thomson–Howell orientation relationships which are experimentally observed [Thompson &amp; Howell (1988). Scr. Metall. 22 , 229–233] in steels. The observed orientation relationship between f.c.c. austenite and cementite is determined by a crystallographic group–subgroup relationship between transformation participants and noncrystallographic symmetry which determines the transformation of triangulated clusters of transformation participants. Sequential fulfillment of diagonal flipping in the 15-vertex fragments of linear substructure (these fragments are equivalent by translation) ensures the austenite–cementite transformation in the whole infinite crystal. The energy barrier for diagonal flipping in the rhombus with iron atoms in its vertices has been calculated using the Morse interatomic potential and is found to be equal to 162 kJ mol −1 at the face-centered cubic–body-centered cubic transformation temperature in iron.",

    "abstract": "Classical crystallography is based on the translational periodicity of crystals and the analysis of discrete Bragg reflections. However, it is inadequate for determining disordered structures, of which the diffuse scattering is vital to evaluate the disorder level. The correlated disorder of IM-18 presents as zigzag chains arranged in translational periodicity and the double four-ring units randomly distributed along two dimensions. Supercell models regulated by multiple probabilities were systematically built to simulate the single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction patterns in order to ascertain the specific disorder configuration in the single-crystal or polycrystalline samples of IM-18. The presence of defects in the polycrystalline sample was proved by combining 29 Si magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and 1 H– 1 H double quantum MAS NMR spectra, and was quantitatively explored by the simulation method. The method could also elucidate other disordered structures in polycrystalline or single-crystal samples, despite the presence of defects or multidimensional disorder.",

The propyl-substituted DPP derivative (PR3C) has three polymorphic forms, each showing a different colour (red, orange and yellow). All polymorphs could be obtained concomitantly under various crystallization conditions. The results of the crystal structure analysis indicate that PR3C adopts different conformations in each polymorph. The packing effect caused by the difference in the arrangement of neighbouring molecules was found to play an important role in the occurrence of the observed polymorphism. The thermodynamic stability relationship between the three polymorphs was identified by thermal analysis and indicates that the yellow polymorph is the thermally stable form. The results indicate that the yellow form and orange form are enantiotropically related, and the other polymorph is monotropically related to the others.",

Among the 263 structures with the shortest Ch...X contact, there are four crystals where no contacts shorter than the sums of van der Waals radii are present (so-called loose crystals).

    "abstract": "Polymorphism of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is of significance in the pharmaceutical industry because it can affect the quality, efficacy and safety of the final drug product. In this regard, polymorphic behavior of cocrystals is no exception because it can influence the development of cocrystals as potential drug formulations. The current contribution aims to introduce two novel polymorphs [forms (III) and (IV)] of agomelatine–hydroquinone (AGO-HYQ) cocrystal and to describe the thermodynamic relationship between the cocrystal polymorphs. All polymorphs were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, hot-stage microscopy and solubility measurements. In addition, the crystal structure of form (II), which has been previously solved from powder diffraction data [Prohens et al. (2016), Cryst. Growth Des. 16 , 1063–1070] and form (III) were determined from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Thermal analysis revealed that AGO-HYQ cocrystal form (III) exhibits a higher melting point and a lower heat of fusion than those of form (II). According to the heat of fusion rule, the polymorphs are enantiotropically related, with form (III) being stable at higher temperatures. Our results also show that the novel form (IV) is the most stable form at ambient conditions and it transforms into form (II) on heating, and therefore, the two polymorphs are enantiotropically related. Furthermore, solubility and van't Hoff plot results suggest that the transition points are approximately 339 K for the pair form (IV)–(II) and 352 K for the pair form (II)–(III).",

    "abstract": "Despite the high profile of aconine in WuTou injection, there has been no preparative technology or structural studies of its salt as the pharmaceutical product. The lack of any halide salt forms is surprising as aconine contains a tertiary nitrogen atom. In this work, aconine was prepared from the degradation of aconitine in Aconiti kusnezoffii radix (CaoWu). A green chemistry technique was applied to enrich the lipophilic-poor aconine. Reaction of aconine with hydrochloride acid resulted in protonation of the nitrogen atom and gave a novel salt form (C 25 H 42 NO 9 + ·Cl − ·H 2 O; aconine hydrochloride monohydrate, AHM), whose cation in the crystal structure was elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analyses. The AHM crystal had a Z ′ = 3 structure with three independent cation–anion pairs, with profound conformational differences among the aconine cations. The central framework of each aconine cation was compared with that of previously reported aconitine, proving that protonation of the nitrogen atom induced the structure rearrangement. In the crystal of AHM, aconine cations, chloride anions and water molecules interacted through inter-species O—H...Cl and O—H...O hydrogen bonds; this complex hydrogen-bonding network stabilizes the supramolecular structure. The seriously disordered solvent molecules were treated using the PLATON SQUEEZE procedure [Spek (2015). Acta Cryst. C 71 , 9–18] and their atoms were therefore omitted from the refinement. Bioactivity studies indicated that AHM promoted in vitro proliferative activities of RAW264.7 cells. Molecular docking suggested AHM could target cardiotoxic protein through the hydrogen-bonding interactions. The structural confirmation of AHM offers a rational approach for improving the pharmaceutical technology of WuTou injection.",

In the same interval, the temperature dependences of the unit-cell parameters and volume show stepwise changes. According to the X-ray diffraction data, the crystal structure consists of nonpolar and polar domains with different local symmetries. The structure is a three-dimensional framework consisting of alternating (Hf,Fe)O 6 octahedra connected by MoO 4 tetrahedra.

The possible paths of ion transport are analyzed.

Its structure consists of [B4O10]8- polyanions (isostructural to P4O10) embedded in an Ag matrix. According to the standard valences Ag+, B3+ and O2-, the formula has an excess of eight e- which the above authors proposed were located, pairwise, in four Ag4 tetrahedra within the silver substructure. That conclusion was based on the semiconducting and diamagnetic properties, as well as the very small `attractors' of the Electron Localization Function (ELF) found at the centre of these Ag4 tetrahedra. However, a large overlap of the projected density of states (DOS) of silver and oxygen indicated possible dispersion interactions between both atomic species. In this article, an alternative description is proposed based on the extended Zintl-Klemm concept. The anion [B4O10]8- can be formulated as Ψ-[N4O10] P4O10, if it is assumed that the eight e- are transferred to the four B atoms, so converting them into Ψ-N, this then makes sense of its similarity with P4O10, [N4(CH2)6], adamantane and tetraisopropyladamantane. When the Ag atoms connect to the O atoms, they arrange as the H atoms do in hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). If the two lone pairs of each of the bridging O atoms in Ψ-[N4O10] are equated to the C-H bonds in HMTA, then, this same equivalence exists between the C-H bonds and the O-Ag bonds in the compound Ag16B4O10. The 24 Ag atoms surrounding each [B4O10]8- group prolong the sphalerite structure of the borate anion by means of Ag-O bonds which also fit the sphalerite structure formed of AgO. The eight excess electrons might then be distributed between the Ag and the O atoms, so making sense of the mixing of the Ag and O states. The Ag atoms bonded to the O atoms of the [B4O10]8- groups form a coat that interconnects the borate anions through Ag-O bonds. To establish the validity of this new proposal, the study needs to be extended to the compound Ag3B5O9.",

The distortion leads to the formation of different discrete anions, like Te 2− , Te 2 2− and Te 3 2− , similar to previously reported structures for RE X 2–δ compounds ( RE = trivalent rare earth metal, X = S, Se, Te). The Te–Te distances in the modulated [Te] layer are found in a narrow range as compared to those in the corresponding sulfides and selenides.",

The average structure of the low-temperature twinned phase is determined and the phase transition is attributed to the formation of a CDW. The diffuse streaking, present in X-ray diffraction patterns above and below the transition at T = 282 K, is shown to be a projection of diffuse concentric rings perpendicular to the c* direction. The simulated patterns, based on a mismatch model between infinite NbSe4 chains, correlated by I atoms, are in good accordance with the experimental patterns. In addition to the experiments, the electronic properties of the high- and the low-temperature phases are calculated with the extended Hückel tight-binding method. The Fermi surfaces of the average structures above and below the phase transition appear very similar. Their shapes support a nesting instability and a CDW formation. The weak incommensurate CDW satellites, present below the phase transition, are at 100 K properly described by a modulation wavevector q = [0.06 (1), 0, 0.55 (1)].",

The structures are built up by a combination of fluorite-related Bi-O units and isolated (SO4)(2-) tetrahedra (new phase I) or both (SO4)(2-) and (AsO4)(3-) tetrahedra (new phase II). Owing to the effect of stereoactive lone pairs of Bi(3+), Bi-O units in both the structures can be suitably described in terms of oxo-centered OBi4 tetrahedra. The structure of Bi14O16(SO4)5 is based upon one-dimensional [O16Bi14](10+) ribbons formed by six chains of edge-sharing OBi4 tetrahedra extending along [010]. In the structure of Bi30O33(SO4)9(AsO4)2 the same ribbon type coexists with another one-dimensional ribbon formed by seven chains of edge-sharing OBi4 tetrahedra and with the composition [O17Bi16](14+). Ribbons of the same type are joined by (SO4)(2-) and (AsO4)(3-) tetrahedra along [010] – if a reduced triclinic unit-cell setting is considered – so forming two different (001) slabs which alternate to each other along [001] and are joined by additional (SO4)(2-) tetrahedra.

In view of future exploitation of IJJs, high-quality superconducting YBCO tape-like single crystals (whiskers) have been synthesized from Ca–Al-doped precursors in the presence of Te. The main aim of this paper is to determine the importance of the simultaneous use of Al, Te and Ca in promoting YBCO whiskers growth with good superconducting properties ( T c = 79–84 K). Further, single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) refinements of tetragonal YBCO whiskers ( P 4/ mmm ) are reported to fill the literature lack of YBCO structure investigations. All the as-grown whiskers have also been investigated by means of X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Our results demonstrate that the interplay of Ca, Te and Al elements is clearly necessary in order to obtain superconducting YBCO whiskers. The data obtained from SC-XRD analyses confirm the highly crystalline nature of the whiskers grown. Ca and Al enter the structure by replacing the Y and the octahedral coordinated Cu1 site, respectively, as in other similar orthorhombic compounds, while Te does not enter the structure of whiskers but its presence in the precursor is essential to the growth of the crystals.",

Comparison along the series, including the previously reported n = 10 and n = 16 derivatives, shows a clear metric trend (b and c essentially fixed along the series and a growing linearly with n), in spite of some subtle differences in space groups and/or packing modes. A uniform packing pattern for the aliphatic chains has been found for the n = 12 to 18 homologues, which slightly differs from that of the n = 10 derivative. The crystalline structures of all the higher homologues (n = 10-18) seem to arise from van der Waals interchain interactions and, to a lesser extent, type II Br...Br interactions. The dominant role of interchain interactions provides direct structural support for the usual interpretation of melting point trends like that found along this series.

The ligands were chosen to probe (i) the electronic effects of inverting the positions of the O-atom donor groups ( i.e. A1 versus B1) and (ii) the electronic and steric effects of the addition of a second methyl group in different positions on the pyridine ring. Two axially coordinated water molecules resulting in a six-coordinated symmetrical octahedron complement the bis-ligand complex of A1. Ligands A2 and A3 form five-coordinated trigonal bipyramidal complexes with one additional water molecule in the coordination sphere, which is a rarely reported geometry for Zn II complexes. Ligand B1 shows a dimeric structure, where the two Zn 2+ dications have slightly distorted octahedral geometry and the pyridinolate O atom of the neighbouring complex bridges them. The coordination spheres of the Zn 2+ dications and the supramolecular structures are discussed in detail. The packing arrangements of 1 – 3 are similar, having alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers, however the similarity is broken in 4 . The obtained coordination geometries are compared with their previously determined Cu II analogues. The study of the individual complexes is complemented with a comprehensive analysis of Zn II complexes with oxygen donor ligands with data from the Cambridge Structural Database.",

The strongly withdrawing nitro group presented a switch of the halogen bond from a lateral to a linear motif. Surprisingly, this appears to be influenced by a net positive shift in charge distribution around the lateral edges of the σ-hole, making the lateral I...I bonding motif less preferable. A channel of amphoteric I...I type II halogen bonds is observed for a chalcone molecule, which was not previously reported in chalcones, alongside an example of the common synthon involving extended linear chains of I...O 2 N donor–acceptor halogen bonds. This work shows that halogenated chalcones may be an interesting target for developing halogen bonding as a significant tool within crystal engineering, a thus far underexplored area for this common structural motif.",

To delineate the different intermolecular interactions and the respective interaction energies in the crystal architectures, energy framework analyses were carried out using the CE-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method implemented in the CrystalExplorer software. In the structures the different molecules are linked by C—H...O, C—H...N and N—H...O hydrogen bonds. Together with these hydrogen bonds, C—H...π and C—O...π interactions are involved in the formation of a three-dimensional crystal network. A Hirshfeld surface analysis allows the visualization of the two-dimensional fingerprint plots and the quantification of the contributions of H...H, H...C/C...H and H...O/O...H contacts throughout the different crystal structures. To obtain additional information on the intrinsic properties of our targets and to compare the experimental crystal structures with their respective conformations in the gas phase, quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP-D3BJ/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory, including Grimme's D3 correction term and BJ damping functions, were carried out to account for intramolecular dispersion interactions. The identified energy gaps between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO–LUMO gap) of our targets in the gas phase and in two implicit solvents (methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide) allow us to quantify the impact of different substituents on the reactivity of mackinazolinone derivatives.",

The crystal structure is built of sheets of nearly regular corner-sharing [MgO 6 ] and [TeO 6 ] octahedra. Half of the bridging O atoms are connected to disordered H atoms, which are located in rhomboidal voids (long and short diameters of ∼5.0 and ∼2.5 Å, respectively) of these layers. Moreover, the Te VI atom connects to two OH − ions and the Mg II atom to two H 2 O molecules. The OH − ions and H 2 O molecules connect adjacent layers forming a disordered hydrogen-bonding network. In a given layer, an adjacent layer may be positioned in four ways, which can be characterized by one of two origin shifts and one of two orientations with respect to [100]. The crystals feature a disordered stacking arrangement, leading to rods of diffuse scattering in the diffraction pattern. The polytypism is explained by application of the order–disorder (OD) theory. Different refinement models are compared and the diffuse scattering is evaluated with structure factor calculations. The correlation coefficient of subsequent origin shifts is ∼ −0.33, whereas the orientation of the layers is essentially random. Determining the latter is particularly difficult owing to a small contribution to the diffraction pattern and virtually indistinguishable diffraction patterns for pairs of correlations with the same absolute value.

    "abstract": "A detailed description of the structure of the amphibole-supergroup minerals is very challenging owing to their complex chemical composition that renders the process of cation partition extremely difficult, particularly because of the occurrence of multivalent elements. Since amphiboles naturally occur under a fibrous morphology and have largely been used to produce asbestos, there is a growing demand for detailed and accurate structural data in order to study the relationships between structure, composition and toxicity. The present study proposes a recommended refinement procedure for both X-ray single-crystal structure refinement (SREF) and Rietveld analysis for tremolite, selected as a test case. The corresponding structural results are compared to estimate the `degree of confidence' of the Rietveld refinement with regard to SREF. In particular, it is shown that the interpretation of the electron density of the tremolite structure by SREF is model dependent. By assuming that the site-scattering values from SREF should be as close as possible to those from electron microprobe analysis, as a crucial constraint for the correct description of the final crystal-chemical model, it is found that it is best satisfied by using partially ionized scattering curves (SCs) for O and Si, and neutral SCs (neutral oxygen curves or NOCs) for other atoms. This combination leads to the best fit to the diffraction data. Moreover, it is found that Rietveld refinement using NOCs produces the best structural results, in excellent agreement with SREF. It is worth noting that, due to the complexity of the diffraction pattern and the fairly large number of freely refinable parameters, refinements with different combinations of SCs produce results almost indistinguishable from a statistical point of view, albeit showing significant differences from a structural point of view.",

Deferiprone is an anti-thalassemia drug known to exhibit polymorphic behaviour. Previously, three polymorphs were reported out of which one of them exhibited Z ′ &gt; 1. In the present manuscript, a fourth polymorph of deferiprone was identified and it also possessed Z ′ &gt; 1. All the four polymorphs showed similar hydrogen bonding features and differed in crystal packing. The ability of deferiprone to crystallize as Z ′ &gt; 1 prompted us to investigate the hydrogen bonding and synthon variation upon cocrystallization of deferiprone with hydroxyl-group-containing coformers such as catechol, hydroquinone, phloroglucinol, resorcinol and pyrogallol. Crystallization attempts along with PXRD analysis aided in obtaining 11 new cocrystal structures which involve different stoichiometric cocrystals and some polymorphs. Synthon analysis, crystal packing as well as thermal behaviour were assessed and compared. The presence of multiple phases in each cocrystal system in its respective bulk powders was identified and quantified using PXRD and Rietveld analysis. Homosynthons were observed in three co-crystal systems, while a heterosynthon was observed in five systems. The combination of both homo- and heterosynthon was observed in three cocrystal systems. The phase transformation events were observed in most of the systems. In nine co-crystal systems, the melting points were observed intermediate between those of the API and the coformers.",

Each I 8 2− unit is built of two triiodides bridged with one diiodine molecules. This system was subjected to compression up to 5.9 GPa under hydrostatic conditions. Pressure alters the supramolecular architecture around I 8 2− , leading to bending of the triiodide units away from their energetically preferred geometry ( D ∞h ). Short I 2 ...I 3 − contacts compress significantly, reaching lengths typical for the covalently bonded polyiodides. Unlike in reported structures at ambient conditions, pressure-induced catenation proceeds without symmetrization of the polyiodides, pointing to a different electron-transfer mechanism. The structure is shown to be half as compressible [B 0 = 12.9 (4) GPa] than the similar CsI 3 structure. The high bulk modulus is associated with higher I—I connectivity and a more compact cationic net, than in CsI 3 . The small discontinuity in the compressibility trend around 3 GPa suggests formation of more covalent I—I bonds. The potential sources of this discontinuity and its implication on the electronic properties of Cs 2 I 8 are discussed.",

There are two NA–PY units in the asymmetric unit. The experimental results are compared with the results obtained from theoretical structure factors modeled using periodic boundary DFT calculations. Both refinements were carried out using the Hansen and Coppens multipolar formalism (in MoPro program). The non-centrosymmetric and polar nature of the crystal system rendered the multipolar refinement challenging which was addressed by involving the transferability principle. This study highlights the significance of the transferability principle in electron density modeling in non-routine situations. The 2:2 cocrystal of NA–PY exhibits a zigzag, brickwall and sheet-like layered structure in three dimensions and is stabilized by strong intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding through N—H...O and O—H...O bonds, some of them due to the zwitterion nature of NA as well as weak interactions between the PY molecules. Ranking these interactions via topological analysis of the electron density shows the leading role of the NA–NA substructure which drives the organization of the cocrystals. These strong interactions between the NA zwitterions may explain why Z ′ = 2.",

Crystals for both enantiomers [(1 a ) and (1 b )] were obtained with high enantiometric excess and examined. An extended network of strong, charge-assisted hydrogen bonding of the + N—H...O − type (also O—H...O and O—H...S for hydrates) is most likely the main factor defining crystal packing and the variable conformation of the cations. The formation of chiral hydrogen-bond motifs – distorted cubans – seems to induce the formation of chiral solid-state structure from achiral components in the case of (4). Diaminium thiosulfates with an odd number of C atoms in the alkyl chain [compounds (1), (2) and (4)] form three-dimensional supramolecular networks, while in the case of diaminium salts with an even number of C atoms [(3) and (5)], two-dimensional layers of hydrogen-bond domains are observed.

Phase-pure polycrystalline and small single-crystal material was obtained all over the series, representing a complete solid-solution series. Differential thermal analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize phase stability, phase changes and structural alterations induced by the substitution of Cu 2+ with Zn 2+ . Whereas pure CaCuGe 2 O 6 exhibits P 2 1 / c symmetry with a strong distortion of the M 1 octahedra and two different Ge sites, one of them with an unusual fivefold coordination, the replacement of Cu 2+ by Zn 2+ induces a chemically driven phase change to the C 2/ c symmetry. The phase change takes place around Zn 2+ contents of 0.12 formula units and is associated with large changes in the unit-cell parameters. Here, the increase of c by as much as 3.2% is remarkable and it is mainly controlled by an expansion of the tetrahedral chains. Further differences between the P 2 1 / c and C 2/ c structures are a more regular chain of edge-sharing M 1 octahedra as a consequence of more and more reduced Jahn–Teller distortion and a less kinked, symmetry-equivalent tetrahedral chain. The coordination of the Ca site increases from sevenfold to eightfold with large changes in the Ca—O bond lengths during the phase change. Raman spectroscopy was mainly used to monitor the P 2 1 / c to C 2/ c phase change as a function of composition, but also as a function of temperature and to follow changes in specific Raman modes throughout the solid-solution series.",

However, [C 4 H 10 NO] + [BF 4 ] − does not develop ferroelectric properties because the incommensurate phase below T c,I = 153 K is centrosymmetric with superspace group Pnam (σ 1 00)00 s and σ 1 = 0.42193 (12) at T = 130 K; the threefold superstructure below T c,II = 117–118 K possesses the acentric but non-ferroelectric space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 . At ambient conditions, [C 4 H 10 NO] + [BF 4 ] − comprises orientationally disordered [BF 4 ] − anions accommodated in cavities between four morpholinium cations. A structure model for the incommensurately modulated phase, which involves modulated orientational ordering of [BF 4 ] − together with modulated distortions and displacements of the morpholinium ions is reported. A mechanism is proposed for the phase transitions, whereby at low temperatures morpholinium cations are shaped around the tetrafluoroborate anion in order to optimize the interactions with one orientation of this anion and, thus, forcing [BF 4 ] − into this orientation. This mechanism is essentially different from a pure order–disorder phase transition. It is supported by consideration of the transition entropy. The difference in configurational entropy between the disordered and incommensurate phases has been computed from the structure models. It is shown to be much smaller than the experimental transition entropy reported by Owczarek et al. [ Chem. Phys. (2011), 381 , 11–20]. These features show that the order–disorder contribution is only a minor contribution to the transition entropy and that other factors, such as conformational changes, play a larger role in the phase transitions.",

Solid State Sci. 61 , 220–224] on the pressure-induced Ni 2 In phase of Li 2 S, at 30 GPa, three concepts related to high-pressure phase transitions are reviewed here. This paper firstly reviews evidence that chemical oxidation (by inclusion of oxygen atoms) can produce a similar effect to the application of physical high pressure and temperature, in an effect labelled as the oxidation–pressure concept. Secondly, the pressure-induced Ni 2 In phase of Li 2 S is the final phase in the double transition antifluorite → anticotunnite → Ni 2 In, as is observed in other alkali metal sulfides. This new phase for Li 2 S could be expected after knowledge of the high-pressure Cmcm phase of Li 2 SO 4 , which is a distortion of the hexagonal I-Na 2 SO 4 phase, both having M 2 S subarrays of the Ni 2 In-type. Thirdly, in order to clarify these links, a simple methodology is proposed for gauging the level of increased stability (by defining a stability enhancement ratio, S ) when the extended Zintl–Klemm concept (EZKC) has been applied. The method uses relative values of the lattice potential energies estimated for Li 2 S and for the pseudo-lattice Ψ-BeS derived by applying the EZKC to Li 2 S, after which, Li 2 S can be reformulated as Li + [LiS] − ≡ Li + [Ψ-BeS].",

    "abstract": "It may be argued that the remarkable properties of the high-temperature superconducting cuprates such as the insulator–metal transition (IMT) and the metal–superconductor transition (MST) originate from competition and interplay between the interlayer ionic interaction and the intralayer covalent bonds in these materials. It is proposed here that the microscopic order parameter is the local field estimated from the ionic polarization at the sub-unit cell level, and it is demonstrated that it shows a strong temperature as well as chemical doping dependence. The out-of-plane ionicity induces an interlayer electron transfer that reduces the ionicity of the layers and leads to IMT, while the in-plane covalency induces in-plane intersite hole transfer that increases the out-of-plane ionicity. It is suggested that this competition leads to a local field catastrophe at a critical temperature T c that drives the compound to MST. The asymmetry of the free charge carrier density breaks locally the mirror reflection symmetry of the order parameter, leading to a pairing between the real current and the polarization current.",

Cesbronite is orthorhombic, space group Cmcm , with a = 2.93172 (16), b = 11.8414 (6), c = 8.6047 (4) Å and V = 298.72 (3) Å 3 . The chemical formula of cesbronite has been revised to Cu II 3 Te VI O 4 (OH) 4 from Cu II 5 (Te IV O 3 ) 2 (OH) 6 ·2H 2 O. This change has been accepted by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the International Mineralogical Association, Proposal 17-C. The previously reported oxidation state of tellurium has been shown to be incorrect; the crystal structure, bond valence studies and charge balance clearly show tellurium to be hexavalent. The crystal structure of cesbronite is formed from corrugated sheets of edge-sharing CuO 6 and (Cu 0.5 Te 0.5 )O 6 octahedra. The structure determined here is an average structure that has underlying ordering of Cu and Te at one of the two metal sites, designated as M , which has an occupancy Cu 0.5 Te 0.5 . This averaging probably arises from an absence of correlation between adjacent polyhedral sheets, as there are two different hydrogen-bonding configurations linking sheets that are related by a ½ a offset. Randomised stacking of these two configurations results in the superposition of Cu and Te and leads to the Cu 0.5 Te 0.5 occupancy of the M site in the average structure. Bond-valence analysis is used to choose the most probable Cu/Te ordering scheme and also to identify protonation sites (OH). The chosen ordering scheme and its associated OH sites are shown to be consistent with the revised chemical formula.",

The structural refinements of Černok et al. [Z. Kristallogr. (2014), 229, 761-773] are taken as the starting point for applying the method. Its purpose is to predict the unit-cell parameters and atomic coordinates at (p-T-X) values in-between those of diffraction experiments. The essential development step for tectosilicates is to define a pseudocubic parameterization of the O4 cages of the SiO4 tetrahedra. The six parameters aPC, bPC, cPC, αPC, βPC and γPC allow a full quantification of the tetrahedral structure, i.e. distortion and enclosed volume. Structural predictions for coesite require that two separate quasi-planar networks are defined, one for the silicon ions and the other for the O4 cage midpoints. A set of parametric curves is used to describe the evolution with pressure of these networks and the pseudocubic parameters. These are derived by fitting to the crystallographic data. Application of the method to monoclinic feldspars and to quartz and cristobalite is discussed. Further, a novel two-parameter quantification of the degree of tetrahedral distortion is described. At pressures in excess of ca 20.45 GPa it is not possible to find a self-consistent solution to the parametric curves for coesite, pointing to the likelihood of a phase transition.",

This gives rise to quite different packing schemes, in the form of simple dimers in (I) but water-mediated hydrogen-bonded chains in (II). The dehydration behaviour of form (II) is highly dependent on the heating rate, with slow rates leading to a clear endothermic dehydration step, towards anhydrous (I), with subsequent melting of this latter phase. Increased heating rates result in a more unclear behaviour ending in a structural collapse (melting of the hydrated phase), at temperatures significantly lower than the melting point of the anhydrous phase. The eventual relevance of the water link in the structure of (II) is discussed in regard to this behaviour.",

Its vanadosilicate framework, consisting of sheets of silicate tetrahedra connected by vanadyl-type square-based pyramids, closely resembles that of the mineral cavansite, Ca(VO)(Si 4 O 10 )·4H 2 O. Due to the disorder in the orientation of the short apical vanadyl groups, the topological symmetry of VSH-13Na was originally described in space group Imma . However, when analysing the systematic absences in our dataset, only the 2 1 screw axis along b was strictly fulfilled suggesting monoclinic space group P 12 1 1. The resulting structure in P 2 1 with a = 14.364 (4), b = 9.134 (2), c = 10.373 (3) Å, β = 90.056 (7)°, V = 1360.9 (7) Å 3 was interpreted as a case of allotwinning of two polytypes with topologically idealized orthorhombic symmetry: A (∼62%) with antiparallel orientation of the vanadyl groups in adjacent (100) layers and B (∼38%) with all vanadyl groups in adjacent layers oriented in the same way. At 398 K, the structure of VSH-13Na became fully dehydrated and adopted the unit-cell parameters a = 12.584 (16), b = 9.525 (13), c = 9.696 (14) Å, β = 90.10 (4)°, V = 1162 (3) Å 3 (space group P 2 1 ). Release of H 2 O caused severe contraction of T —O— T angles and the unit-cell volume decreased by ∼15%. Despite their structural similarity, the VSH-13Na framework seems to be more flexible upon dehydration compared with cavansite, whose structure collapsed before removal of the last H 2 O molecule. Thus, the presence of monovalent or divalent extraframework cations plays a key role in the dehydration process of natural and synthetic vanadosilicates.",

In addition, both the differences and changes in the axial thermal expansion coefficients in the region 100-290 K can be explained by the changes involving both the hydrogen bonding and the secondary I...O halogen bonds.",

    "abstract": "Many members of the complex crystalline fluorite supercell structures (e.g. zirconolite, pyrochlore and murataite polytypes) have been considered/studied for possible long-term radioactive-waste immobilization. The eight-coordinated sites in these crystals are of particular importance because they are preferred for the accommodation of trivalent rare earths and actinides present in radioactive waste from fuel element processing. The fluorite-type supercell structures include the murataites, M3, M5, M7, M8, having those numbers of repeating fluorite sub-cell units. One simple technique, as shown here, namely the substitution of Hf into the Zr site, is very helpful for structural analysis in these very complex cases in order to further illuminate the site preference of the Zr ion. Three M3 murataite samples, Ca-Mn-Ti-Zr-Al-Fe-O (regular M3), Ca-Ti-Zr-Al-Fe-O (Mn-free M3) and Ca-Mn-Ti-Hf-Al-Fe-O (Hf-substituted M3) are investigated and, through techniques described for larger cells, show that the Zr is very likely not to be hosted in the [6]Ti site in the M3 murataite structure, as suggested by Pakhomova et al. [(2013), Z. Kristallogr. Cryst. Mater. 228, 151-156], but more likely replaces the [8]Ca1 site and less likely the [8]Ca2 site. This adjusted site preference for each cation from the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy electron energy-loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) methods, agrees well with the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image.",

A variety of parameters/conditions have been probed using the general Co II / X − / L H or L ′H ( X − = Cl − , Br − , I − , NO 3 − , NCS − , ClO 4 − , SO 4 2− ) reaction system. Interestingly, X-ray analyses reveal two distinct groups of complexes: reactions with L H only lead to tetrahedral or quasi-tetrahedral complexes { i.e . [CoCl 2 ( L H) 2 ] ( 1 ), [CoI 2 ( L H) 2 ] ( 2 ), [Co(NO 3 ) 2 ( L H) 2 ] ( 3 ), [Co(NCS) 2 ( L H) 2 ] ( 4 )}, whereas L ′H favours octahedral coordination { i.e. [Co( L ′H) 4 (MeCN)(H 2 O)]I 2 ( 5 ), [Co( L ′H) 4 (MeCN)(H 2 O)](NO 3 ) 2 ( 6 ) and [Co(NCS) 2 ( L ′H) 4 )]·2MeOH ( 7 ·2MeOH)}.

The supramolecular assembly is firmly directed, in all types of complexes, by robust N—H... X ( X = Cl, I, O or S) motifs, leading to varying dimensionalities (1D, 2D or 3D) and packing arrangements. The formation of these motifs has been activated by choosing appropriate anions X , acting as terminal ligands or counterions. At a second level of organization, additional subordinate C—H... X ( X = Cl, I, O or S), C—H...π and π...π intermolecular interactions complement the rigidity of the complexes' packing towards compact 3D assemblies. Hirshfeld surface analyses provided insight into the intermolecular interactions, allowed quantification of the individual contact types and comparison between the complexes.",

Heating of NH 4 SCN leads to a range of new carbon nitride compounds, which have been structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Heating at ambient pressure to 175°C leads to guanidinium thiocyanate, H 6 CN 3 SCN ( 1 ), and when maintaining that temperature for about 12 h a water-insoluble carbon nitride product is formed, which is a co-crystal between melamine and melamium thiocyanate, [H 6 C 3 N 6 ]·[H 10 C 6 N 11 ] + ·[SCN] − ( 2 ). In situ powder X-ray diffraction measurements of this material reveal a gradual transformation from ( 2 ), via two intermediate products, to a final melon-like end product.

Mikrochim. Acta, 72, 259-271], though it is unstable in high-humidity conditions. The monohydrate structure (II), in turn, dehydrates by heating and topotactically transform into anhydrate (III). This latter form appears as less stable than anhydrate (I), to which it is linked via a monotropic relationship. For these three different forms, the crystal structure has been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structures and molecular conformations of forms (II) and (III) are quite similar, as expected from the topotactic transformation linking them; furthermore, under high-humidity conditions, form (III) shows changes compatible with a transformation into form (II) within 24 h. The crystal structure of form (I) is different from the other two. The remaining polymorphic form (IV) could only be obtained as a powder, from which its crystalline structure could not be determined. The relative thermodynamic stability of the different crystalline forms was determined by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetrical studies, and their stability under different humidity conditions analysed.",

The conditions of the crystallization experiments for TPT-I and TPT-II are the dominant factors that determine the final crystalline products. The crystals of TPT-II are long needles. They exhibit bending behaviour along the crystallographic b direction when a mechanical force is imposed perpendicular to it, and regain their original shape after the external stress is removed.

Upon cooling, tetragonal Rb2TaF7 undergoes a first-order phase transition at 145 K and the seven-coordinated polyhedron transforms into a regular CTP. The seven-coordinated polyhedron in (NH4)2TaF7 approaches the PB configuration as the temperature decreases. Cubic elpasolite-like Rb3TaOF6 is characterized by the simultaneous two-state coexistence of TaOF63- of the PB shape as rigidly reoriented and as fluxional.

Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the title compound undergoes a sequence of three reversible phase transitions, which has been verified by variable-temperature X-ray diffraction analysis during cooling-heating cycles over the temperature ranges 290-100-290 K. In the room-temperature phase (I), space group C2/c, oxygen atoms from the closest Fe-atom environment (octahedral) were disordered over two equivalent positions around a twofold axis. Two intermediate phases (II), (III) were solved and refined as incommensurately modulated structures, employing the superspace formalism applied to single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Both structures can be described in the (3+1)-dimensional monoclinic X2/c(α,0,γ)0s superspace group (where X is ½, ½, 0, ½) with modulation wavevectors q = (0.2943, 0, 0.5640) and q = (0.3366, 0, 0.5544) for phases (II) and (III), respectively. The completely ordered low-temperature phase (IV) was refined with the twinning model in the triclinic P{\\overline 1} space group, revealing the existence of two domains. The dynamics of the disordered anionic substructure in the 4apFeS crystal seems to play an essential role in the phase transition mechanisms.

Lett. 22 , 2584–2589] but the twin characterization was not published. This twinning presents several interesting features. The crystal structure is monoclinic, but its lattice is metrically strongly pseudo-orthorhombic and underpins a strongly pseudo-hexagonal sublattice. Several possible twin laws are compatible with these metric specializations, among which the one found experimentally corresponds to a trichromatic point group. Twinning is by reticular pseudo-merohedry with twin index 2 and zero obliquity but a non-zero twin misfit. The twin lattice coincides with the pseudo-hexagonal sublattice of the individual domain, which justifies the adoption of the unconventional setting B 2 1 of the space group.",

The compounds crystallize in the space group R 3 c and are isostructural with the sodium-ion conductor II-Na 3 Fe 2 (AsO 4 ) 3 and yurmarinite, Na 7 (Fe 3+ , Mg, Cu) 4 (AsO 4 ) 6 ; their basic structural units are flat polyhedral clusters of the central M 1O 6 octahedron sharing edges with three surrounding M 2O 6 octahedra, which combine with single NaO 6 octahedra and bridging MoO 4 tetrahedra to form open three-dimensional (3D) frameworks where the cavities are partially occupied by disordered potassium (sodium) ions. The split alkali-ion positions in K 3– x Na 1+ x M 4 (MoO 4 ) 6 ( M = Ni, Mg, Co) give their structural formulae as [(K,Na) 0.5 □ 0.5 )] 6 (Na)[ M 1][ M 2] 3 (MoO 4 ) 6 , whereas the lithium-containing compound (K 0.5 □ 0.5 ) 6 (Mg 0.89 K 0.11 )(Li 0.89 Mg 0.11 )Mg 3 (MoO 4 ) 6 shows an unexpected (Mg, K) isomorphism, which is similar to (Mn, K) and (Co, K) substitutions in isostructural K 3+ x Li 1– x M 4 (MoO 4 ) 6 ( M = Mn, Co). The crystal chemistry of the title compounds and related arsenates, phosphates and molybdates was considered, and the connections of the cationic distributions with potential 3D ionic conductivity were shown by means of calculating the bond valence sum (BVS) maps for the Na + , Li + and K + ions. Electrical conductivity measurements gave relatively low values for the triple molybdates [σ = 4.8 × 10 −6 S cm −1 at 390°C for K 3 NaCo 4 (MoO 4 ) 6 and 5 × 10 −7 S cm −1 at 400°C for K 3 LiMg 4 (MoO 4 ) 6 ] compared with II-Na 3 Fe 2 (AsO 4 ) 3 (σ = 8.3 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at 300°C).

A complex trigonal structure with a high-volume unit cell of 12987 Å 3 was found, with a very long a (= b ) [52.8790 (14) Å] and a very short c [5.36308 (13) Å] unit-cell parameter (hexagonal setting). The detailed analysis of the intermolecular interactions observed in the crystal structure of 1 highlights its potential towards the implementation of this core as a semiconductor in organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) devices. Since the molecule has a flat configuration reflecting its π-conjugated system, neighbouring molecules are found to stack atop each other in a slipped parallel fashion via π–π stacking interactions between planes of ca 3.30 Å, with a centroid–centroid distance between the aromatic rings corresponding to the shortest axis of the unit cell ( i.e. c ). The alkylation of the three N atoms proves to be a decisive feature since it favours the presence of C—H...π interactions in all directions, which strengthens the crystal packing. As a whole, PXRD proves to be a valuable option for the resolution of otherwise inaccessible organic crystal structures of interest in different areas.",

    "abstract": "The crystal structure of Blatter's radical (1,3-diphenyl-1,4-dihydrobenzo[ e ][1,2,4]triazin-4-yl) has been investigated between ambient pressure and 6.07 GPa. The sample remains in a compressed form of the ambient-pressure phase up to 5.34 GPa, the largest direction of strain being parallel to the direction of π-stacking interactions. The bulk modulus is 7.4 (6) GPa, with a pressure derivative equal to 9.33 (11). As pressure increases, the phenyl groups attached to the N1 and C3 positions of the triazinyl moieties of neighbouring pairs of molecules approach each other, causing the former to begin to rotate between 3.42 to 5.34 GPa. The onset of this phenyl rotation may be interpreted as a second-order phase transition which introduces a new mode for accommodating pressure. It is premonitory to a first-order isosymmetric phase transition which occurs on increasing pressure from 5.34 to 5.54 GPa. Although the phase transition is driven by volume minimization, rather than relief of unfavourable contacts, it is accompanied by a sharp jump in the orientation of the rotation angle of the phenyl group. DFT calculations suggest that the adoption of a more planar conformation by the triazinyl moiety at the phase transition can be attributed to relief of intramolecular H...H contacts at the transition. Although no dimerization of the radicals occurs, the π-stacking interactions are compressed by 0.341 (3) Å between ambient pressure and 6.07 GPa.",

Since then, there has only been limited discussion on this topic with reference to several real structures and an efficient method for finding homometric structures for a known three-dimensional structure is still lacking today. In this work, a method was developed to create a set of structures with the same interatomic distances as an original structure, which can then be identified as powder X-ray diffraction or single-crystal X-ray diffraction homometric structures. This method was applied to the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and homometric structures for 37 reported structures were found. Also it was found that homometric structures are encountered frequently in solving crystal structures when building initial models with only heavy atoms, which indicates that special caution is needed in interpreting XRD data with heavy-atom methods.",

The thorough study of polymorphic structures before and after crystal structure transformation has revealed some pre-conditions for a polymorphic transition and regularities of changes in molecular and crystal structure. In metastable polymorph 1a , the conformationally flexible molecule adopts a conformation with the higher energy and forms a less preferable linear supramolecular synthon. Additional energy imparted to a crystal structure during the grinding process proved to be enough to overcome low energy barriers for the nitrogen inversion and rotation of the oxazole ring around the sp 3 – sp 2 single bond. As a result, polymorph 1b with a molecule adopting conformation with lower energy and forming a more preferable centrosymmetric supramolecular synthon was obtained. The study of pairwise interaction energies in the two polymorphs has shown that metastable polymorph 1a is organized by molecular building units and has a columnar-layered structure. A centrosymmetric dimer should be recognized as a complex building unit in more stable polymorph 1b , which has a layered structure.",

    "abstract": "A number of Lu 2 O 3 -based materials were reported to present efficient capability of trapping excited charge carriers in metastable excited states formed either by specific dopants or naturally occurring defects. Over the years, abundant experimental data have been collected, which were taken as a solid ground to treat the problem using computational chemistry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with an advanced meta generalized gradient approximation (mGGA) functional were used to analyze electron trapping in cubic Lu 2 O 3 doped with Hf. Individual ions of dopant and nearest-neighbor dopant ion pairs were considered. The effects of interstitial anions such as O 2− and Cl − were analyzed. In most of the analyzed cases the additional electron charge is localized at the dopant site. However, in many of the studied cases, the dopant/defect states overlap with the conduction band and cannot correspond to electron trapping. The Hf 3+ ion in the Lu site of C 3i local symmetry ({\\rm Hf}^{\\times}_{{\\rm Lu}-C_{\\rm 3i}}) corresponds to a moderate trap depth of 0.8–0.9 eV. Several composite defects corresponding to deeper (1.1–1.4 eV) traps also exist. Unambiguous deep traps (1.5–1.8 eV) correspond to systems with Hf dopant in the cationic void, accompanied by two interstitial oxygen atoms. The results thus indicate that basic `Hf-substitutes-Lu' doping is unlikely to correspond to the deep traps observed experimentally in Lu 2 O 3 :Tb,Hf andLu 2 O 3 :Pr,Hf and more complex defects must be involved.",

The observation of diffuse scattering in a synthetic β-VOSO 4 provides a microscopic interpretation of the underlying correlated disorder, which is linked to the inversion of the short–long V—O distance pairs along VO 6 chains, forming a local defect state. Direct Monte Carlo modeling indicates that such defects form thin layers with a positive inter-layer correlation, forming small domains with inverted vanadyl bonding patterns. Two-dimensional defects in anisotropic magnetic systems may perturb, or even destroy, long-range magnetic ordering leading to unusual interactions. In particular, the lack of inversion symmetry in the defect layers opens up the possibility for the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) and, consequently, chiral magnetism localized in the defect planes. The defect β-VOSO 4 structure, therefore, opens up new possibilities for the study of low-dimensional magnetic systems.",

    "abstract": "Solar thermochemical hydrogen production (STCH) via redox-active metal oxides is an approach for direct solar-driven hydrogen generation typically using a high-temperature redox cycle involving refractory oxides and steam. Typical cycles involve high-temperature reduction of oxides to form oxygen vacancies, followed by lower temperature reaction between oxygen vacancies and steam where the oxide is re-oxidized and the steam is reduced to hydrogen. Only a few materials have demonstrated reversible cycling under the typically harsh STCH conditions ( e.g. 1500°C reduction, 900°C re-oxidation) and critical questions remain on the true reversibility of non-stoichiometric multi-cation oxide systems, significantly hampered by the lack of single-phase samples for these material systems. To date, most STCH processes have relied on CeO 2 as a benchmark active material, but more recently, the 12R phase of BaCe 0.25 Mn 0.75 O 3 (BCM) has demonstrated greater hydrogen-generation potential at lower peak temperatures. However, previous reports of 12R-BCM have included large fractions, &gt; 10 wt%, of secondary phases, which complicate analysis of the stability and performance. A comprehensive understanding of the redox mechanism and reversibility of the process in BCM can only be achieved with nearly single-phase samples which, to date, have been difficult to produce. Here two approaches to BCM synthesis are reported: solid state and sol–gel-based routes. It is demonstrated that both routes can be tuned to produce the 12R structure with &gt; 97 wt% yield when annealed ≥1450°C. Herein synchrotron-based diffraction measurements of rhombohedral 12R-BCM enabled characterization of the anisotropy between thermal expansion along the c -axis and within the ab plane. The impact of high-temperature redox cycling on the stability and phase fraction of the 12R-BCM polytype was also investigated. These results offer two viable routes for synthesis of high-purity 12R-BCM critically needed for evaluating the efficacy of BCM as a STCH material and validate its ability to split water at lower temperatures over extended numbers of redox cycles.",

    "abstract": "‘Introduction to Nanofiber Materials’ is interesting as it is written for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as research scientists in material engineering, bioengineering and especially nanotechnology. The book is very well planned and well written, with a comprehensive introduction to nanosize scale materials and the chemistry of polymeric materials. An in-depth explanation of the basic properties of polymers helps the reader to refresh knowledge acquired during university courses, and is a very good introduction to further content, especially various methods of fiber formation, with understandable and clear schematics which are essential to fully understand nanofiber formation and their advantages and limits. The chapter on nanofiber technology describes briefly methods of nanofiber production, with special focus on the electrospinning method, and emphasis placed on the influence of process parameters on fiber formation and diameter. Comprehensive knowledge about process parameters is essential when using the electrospinning method. Fiber formation by electrospinning depends on many various parameters, interacting together in many combinations. The work presented updates progress on understanding these dependencies and gives an explanation of the methodology of modelling and electrospinning simulation which still have not been fully understood. The authors of this work focus on the methods of characterization and test nanofibrous materials which have been divided very intuitively. The reader will learn about ways of characterizing polymeric materials with a number of useful examples of satisfying or unsatisfying results like spectra, visualizations and graphs. The principles of every method described in the book are also explained in a very approachable way. Characterization methods are presented in accordance with recent research, which shows the reader how to apply those methods in the laboratory and how to interpret the results. Electrospun polymeric fibers have been investigated extensively for the last decade. A large number of various polymeric materials were used to create nanofibrous sheets in various forms. In this work, the authors summarized the most recent research in bioactive nanofibers, electroactive fibers and nanocomposite fibrous materials. Fiber research has been extensively studied in recent years, and has a high potential for commercialization in the near future. In particular, the presented bioactive properties of nanofibers showed the methodology and possible future areas of development that researchers may be interested in. Nevertheless, the drug delivery section could be extended by including the electrospraying technique, which becomes a complementary method of creating polymeric drug delivery systems. The electroactive properties of nanofibers result from their chemical composition and dimensions. The discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 revealed a huge potential for the production of electroconductive and supermagnetic materials. The simultaneous development of electrospinning and characterization techniques of nanomaterials brought a wide range of possible applications of these materials, which are described in-depth by the authors. The combination of various materials leads to the formation of a completely novel and promising group of nanocomposite fibrous textiles. Similar to previously mentioned components, authors emphasize the production of nanocomposites and their advantages and limitations, which may be a valuable guide for the experienced reader.

Crystallization of (1) yields two inclusion compounds containing tetrahydrofuran (THF): (1)4·THF is obtained from a mixture of THF and methanol, whereas (1)2·THF is obtained from pure THF. The X-ray crystal structures reveal that the two compounds are extremely similar and that their host arrangements are essentially identical. They differ, however, in the proportion, orientation and host-guest interaction of the included THF molecules. The disordered guest molecules in (1)4·THF are oriented along the guest channel direction, whereas in (1)2·THF they lie across the channel. This unusual solvent-guest control of inclusion structures has implications relating to the formation of polymorphic structures and other competing crystal forms.",

    "abstract": "Following the discovery of spectacular phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance, transition metal compounds have been at the forefront of solid-state research for the past three decades.The research inspired by these discoveries is extremely diverse, ranging from fundamental studies of model Hamiltonians with strong electronic correlations all the way to the synthesis and characterization of next-generation electronic devices.The result is a massive body of knowledge that even insiders often find bewildering.In the course of a long and distinguished career, Daniel Khomskii has made leading contributions to many aspects of research on transition metal compounds.Due to his overview of the field and his pedagogical skill, he is much sought after as a lecturer at summer schools, and his typewritten lecture notes have been circulating among researchers for some time.The book lives up to this reputation and offers a comprehensive yet highly readable introduction to the field.The introductory Chapter 1 exposes the dichotomy between the itinerant electronic states treated in standard textbooks on solid-state physics and the localized states that are required to describe the strongly correlated electron systems in transition metal compounds.It also introduces the Hubbard model and the concept of a Mott insulator.Chapter 2 summarizes basic concepts of atomic physics including Hund's rules and the spin-orbit coupling.The next two chapters describe issues that are germane to transition metal compounds, starting from a description of the most common lattice architectures and the steric constraints that underlie their formation.Chapter 3 also outlines the interactions of transition metal ions with the surrounding lattice, including charge transfer between the ionic species and crystal fields acting on the transition metal ions, as well as their interplay with the intra-atomic interactions.Chapter 4 discusses the hybridization between transition metal and ligand states and its consequences for the basic electronic structure of transition metal compounds.These include issues such as the classification of insulating metal oxides into Mott Hubbard and charge transfer insulators and the formation of Zhang-Rice singlets, which are still very much debated in the field.Chapters 5-8 address electronic ordering phenomena that are widely observed in transition metal compounds.Magnetic order and the exchange interactions driving its formation are topics of Chapter 5. Starting from a basic discussion of superexchange and double-exchange interactions, the subsequent discussion also covers issues of current interest such as geometrical frustration, collective singlet states and spin-state transitions.Chapter 6 describes orbital ordering in insulators and its impact on magnetism, moving on to the Kugel-Khomskii Hamiltonian and the quantum dynamics of orbitals that have been subjects of intense recent research.Charge order and its interplay with orbital and magnetic order are reviewed in Chapter 7.Here as elsewhere, the author first discusses the key factors driving charge ordering in well known materials such as magnetite and manganese oxides, and then draws interesting parallels to other compounds such as silver and gold compounds that have been less widely studied.Chapter 8 covers ferroelectricity and its combination with different forms of collective order.The discussion of the different origins of multiferroicity, which builds on the understanding of spin, charge and orbital order carefully developed in the previous chapters, is one of the highlights of this book.",

    "abstract": "As the title indicates, the book ‘Nanoparticles’ by R. Jelinek deals with objects at the nanometric scale. As nanoscience and nanotechnology devoted to nanoparticles represent an ‘enormous scope’, carboneous nanomaterials and preparation processes like lithography are excluded from the content. The aim of this book is to give an overview of nanoparticles to a reader who is not necessarily active or an expert in this discipline. This overview is given through selected examples of nanoparticle applications, with a preference given to biomedical ones. With such a generic title as ‘Nanoparticles’ (NPs), the reader may be misled about its contents. Indeed, does it just talk about objects with a nanometric scale or objects for which a specific property arises from their nanometric size? That is the first question to ask when nanoparticles are concerned. In the first case, all kinds of solid nanoscale compounds are concerned whereas in the second one, only the compounds related to the nanosciences and nanotechnology fields fall under the scope of this book. The aim of this book is to serve as a ‘starting point’ for further investigation in the field of nanoparticles ‘with a methodical summary of the field – how concepts, synthesis schemes and applications of NPs have been developed and implemented’. So a clear definition of the term ‘nanoparticles’ can rightly be expected, but in the introduction we learn that ‘the precise definition of NPs may be somewhat fluid’. Then the term ‘nanoparticles’ is defined as ‘atomic and molecular aggregates which are generally smaller than tens of nanometers’. It is worth noting that in the preface this definition concerns only ‘atomic aggregates’ presenting unique properties due to their nanometric dimensions. After a brief introduction of the book and description of ‘historical context and early work’ (Chapter 1), the next three chapters deal with inorganic nanoparticles and constitute the main part of the book with 177pp. Chapter 2 introduces bandgap theory with the size-dependence of electronic structure and ‘Semiconductor nanoparticles’. Different chemical compositions and morphologies of nanoparticles are presented through applications in biosensing, solar cells and photonics fields. However, different points like solar cell efficiency, interest of NPs’ chemical composition or morphology are not discussed in detail and do not allow the reader to really appreciate the impact of nanoparticles on these specific fields. Chapter 3, which is the most prominent one (85 pp), deals with metallic nanoparticles and focuses mainly on gold nanoparticles. The choice of gold nanoparticles allows the introduction of the concept of localized surface plasmon resonance in an easy way. The synthesis of spherical gold nanoparticles is briefly presented, followed by the application of gold nanoparticles in different fields such as sensing and catalysis. Then, gold nanorods/nanowires are rapidly introduced, followed by a survey of other morphologies of gold nanoparticles–nanoprisms and polyhedral, hollow and branched nanoparticles. The reader has to wait until section 3.2 about silver nanoparticles and section 3.3 about noble metal and transition metal nanoparticles to obtain a better understanding of metallic nanoparticle synthesis thanks to figures depicting the formation of different nanoparticle shapes during the nanoparticles’ growth process. The last section, 3.4 ‘Hybrid nanoparticles’, shows a large range of possibilities, namely alloy, core-shell metal and Janus nanoparticles. Metal and metalloid oxide nanoparticles are introduced in Chapter 4 (45 pp), which is easy to follow thanks to its structure: the different sub-sections start with the presentation of the type of metal oxide, followed by an explanation of how nanoparticles can be prepared and finish with examples of their potential applications.

    "abstract": "Despite being one of the most common minerals in the earth's crust the crystal structure of intermediate e-plagioclase remains only partially understood, due in a large part to its complex diffraction patterns including satellite reflections. In this article we present a detailed analysis of the structure of e-plagioclase (An44) using single-crystal X-ray diffraction measured at ambient and low temperature (T = 100 K), in which the full modulated structure is successfully refined. As in earlier studies, the diffraction pattern exhibits strong main a-reflections and weak e-satellite reflections. The average structure could be solved in terms of an albite-like basic cell with the triclinic centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric space groups P \\bar 1 and P1 (treated in its C \\bar 1 and C1 setting, respectively, to follow conventions in the literature), while the incommensurately modulated structure was modeled in (3 + 1)D superspace, employing both the centro- and non-centrosymmetric superspace groups X \\bar 1(αβγ)0 and X1(αβγ)0, where X refers to a special (3 + 1)D lattice centering with centering vectors (0 0 ½ ½), (½ ½ 0 ½), and (½ ½ ½ 0). Individual positional and occupational modulations for Ca/Na were refined with deeper insights being revealed in the non-centrosymmetric structure model. Through the structural details emerging from this model, the origin of the modulation can be traced to the communication between Ca/Na site positions through their bridging aluminosilicate (Si/Al)O4 tetrahedra.",

    "abstract": "Two examples of contact twins in pyrite from Peru are described. The first one, from Pasto Bueno ore deposit, shows the pyritohedron {120} as principal form, accompanied by the {111} octahedron and {100} cube as secondary forms, giving a lenticular aspect. (111) is the composition plane, and the twin operation is any one of the three binary axes 〈110〉 within this plane. The second one (unknown ore deposit) presents two forms, the octahedron {111} and the pyritohedron {120}; the two crystals in the twin are elongated along [101] and [011], respectively, producing a V profile. It is a reflection twin where the twin plane (110) coincides with the composition plane. These twins are by merohedry. Another contact twin is known in the literature, reported by Gaubert [ Bull.

The occurrence of these twins as well as the doubtfulness of the spinel twin in pyrite shows a direct relationship with the structural interpretation based on the pseudo-symmetry of the crystallographic orbits.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, significant advances have been made in the precise control of the physical properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) via the linker-modulated method in which modulators compete with linkers and impose kinetic limitations through crystal growth. In this regard, the structure of a new barium-organic framework [Ba(H2BTC)2(H2O)4]n, BaBTC (BTC = 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid) is introduced, which allows the competitive coordination strategy and growth orientation of an alkaline-earth metal-organic framework (AEMOF) to be probed without sacrificing phase purity, porosity and crystallinity. The modulator effect of an assortment of amino acids on the particle size and morphology of BaBTC is investigated. Additionally, another new MOF [Ba(BTC)2(H2O)3]n.nH2O, BaBTC-2, is synthesized through a change in the ligand concentration. This work gives a successful example of a modulation method for AEMOF synthesis by amino acids that may contribute towards targeting future avenues of nanomaterial synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Amongst the derivatives of 4-biphenylcarboxylic acid and amino acid esters, the crystal structure of 4-biphenylcarboxy-(L)-phenylalaninate is unusual owing to its monoclinic symmetry within a pseudo-orthorhombic crystal system. The distortion is described by a disparate rotational property around the chiral centers (φ chiral ≃ −129° and 58°) of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Each of these molecules comprises planar biphenyl moieties (φ biphenyl = 0°). Using temperature-dependent single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments we show that the compound undergoes a phase transition below T ∼ 124 K that is characterized by a commensurate modulation wavevector, q = δ(101), δ = ½. The (3+1)-dimensional modulated structure at T = 100 K suggests that the phase transition drives the biphenyl moieties towards noncoplanar conformations with significant variation of internal torsion angle (φ max biphenyl ≤ 20°). These intramolecular rotations lead to dimerization of the molecular stacks that are described predominantly by distortions in intermolecular tilts (θ max ≤ 20°) and small variations in intermolecular distances (Δ d max ≃ 0.05 Å) between biphenyl molecules. Atypical of modulated structures and superstructures of biphenyl and other polyphenyls, the rotations of individual molecules are asymmetric (Δφ biphenyl ≈ 5°) while φ biphenyl of one independent molecule is two to four times larger than the other. Crystal-chemical analysis and phase relations in superspace suggest multiple competing factors involving intramolecular steric factors, intermolecular H—C...C—H contacts and weak C—H...O hydrogen bonds that govern the distinctively unequal torsional properties of the molecules.",

Kemi (1955), 8 , 245–256], intercalate NH 4 Cl·As 2 O 3 ·0.5H 2 O ({\\bf Y_{{NH}_{4}Cl}}) is not isostructural with compound KCl·As 2 O 3 ·0.5H 2 O. This is very unlikely because both NH 4 Br·2As 2 O 3 and KBr·2As 2 O 3 as well as NH 4 I·2As 2 O 3 and KI·2As 2 O 3 are isostructural. Hence, intercalate {\\bf Y_{{NH}_{4}Cl}} has been studied using single-crystal X-ray diffraction in addition to attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and 15 N solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopies. These techniques indicate that revising the previous crystal structure model is necessary. Compound {\\bf Y_{{NH}_{4}Cl}} crystallizes in space group P 6/ mmm with unit-cell parameters a = 5.25420 (10) Å and c = 12.6308 (3) Å and is isostructural with KCl·As 2 O 3 ·0.5H 2 O. The presence of two symmetry-independent ammonium cations in the structure has been unequivocally confirmed using 15 N ssNMR spectroscopy. The 15 N ssNMR spectrum of intercalate {\\bf Y_{{NH}_{4}Cl}} has been compared with analogous spectra of NH 4 Br·2As 2 O 3 and NH 4 I·2As 2 O 3 which allowed for a probable assignment of signals to ammonium cations occupying particular sites in the crystal structures. Thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and variable-temperature ATR-FTIR spectra have revealed that intercalate {\\bf Y_{{NH}_{4}Cl}} is dehydrated between 320 and 475 K. Upon cooling or standing in moist air water is re-absorbed. Dehydration leads to significant shortening of the c unit-cell parameter as revealed by powder X-ray diffraction [ c = 12.1552 (7) Å at 293 K].

    "abstract": "Aluminium alloy 7005 is widely used for structural purposes because of its attractive properties such as good weldability and age-hardening capability. However, since the workability of this alloy falls after a short period of natural aging, the application of cold rolling for the production of strain-hardened sheets of this alloy is a challenge. Two solutions proposed to overcome this challenge are as follows: ( a ) immediate rolling of the alloy after solution treatment and ( b ) rolling of the alloy after artificial aging. However, there is no comprehensive study comparing the effect of pre-rolling aging treatments on the evolutions of microstructure and texture of the alloy through heavy cold rolling. This subject is the aim of the present study. For this purpose, different pieces of the alloy are subjected to three different heat treatments before rolling, and afterward, they are rolled to obtain a thickness reduction of 80%. Scanning electron microscopy with electron backscattered diffraction observations are applied to study the evolutions of the microstructure and the texture of the alloy. Results show that the progression of pre-rolling aging decreases the incidence of micro-scaled shear bands by rolling. In addition, the rolling texture intensity decreases with the advancement of pre-rolling aging. Mechanisms responsible for this effect are discussed.",

Using trifluoromethanesulfonate instead of perchlorate(VII) affects the self-assembly of the X-shaped units and the breathing function of the resulting crystals. The latter are not breathing crystals. Copper(I) trifluoromethanesulfonate with N -[4-(bromobenzylidene)-4 H -1,2,4-triazol-4-amine crystallizes in two forms: open (with the presence of 1D channels) and closed (without 1D channels). Both are characterized by the presence of X-shaped binuclear cationic units and the trigonal coordination sphere of copper(I) ions. The open form has the ability to engage in reversible sorption. The desorption process is associated with the large reorientation of the binuclear units and the reorganization of the intermolecular interactions leading to the closure of the channels. The post-synthetically obtained channel-less form differs from the channel-less form obtained by direct crystallization, the latter being incapable of sorption. The mechanism of the desorption process of the open form is governed by the general principle of dense packing, and the main reason for the sorption process is the formation of directional halogen–halogen interactions. The halogen atom in the para position of the ligands influences the formation of different crystalline forms and also a different mechanism for the desorption process.",

    "abstract": "Human tooth enamel (HTE) is the hardest tissue in the human body and its structural organization shows a hierarchical composite material. At the nanometric level, HTE is composed of approximately 97% hydroxyapatite [HAP, Ca 10 (PO 4 ) 6 (OH) 2 ] as inorganic phase, and of 3% as organic phase and water. However, it is still controversial whether the hexagonal HAP phase crystallizes in P 6 3 / m or another space group. The observance in HTE of Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ and Na + ions using X-ray characteristic energy-dispersive spectroscopy in the scanning electron microscope has been explained by substitutions in the HAP unit cell. Thus, Ca 2+ can be replaced by Na + and Mg 2+ ions; the PO 4 3− group can be replaced by CO 3 2− ions; and the OH − ions can also be replaced by CO 3 2− . A unit-cell model of the hexagonal structure of HTE is not fully defined yet. In this work, density functional theory calculations are performed to study the hexagonal HAP unit cell when substitution by OH − , CO 3 2− , Mg 2+ and Na + ions are carried out. An approach is presented to study the crystallographic unit cell of HTE by examining the changes resulting from the inclusion of these different ions in the unit cell of HAP. Enthalpies of formation and crystallographic characteristics of the electron diffraction patterns are analysed in each case. The results show an enhancement in structural stability of HAP with OH defects, atomic substitution of Mg 2+ , carbonate and interstitial Na + . Simulated electron diffraction patterns of the generated structures show similar characteristics to those of human tooth enamel. Hence, the results explain the indiscernible structural changes shown in experimental X-ray diffractograms and electron diffraction patterns.",

The two metals are among the dopants used to achieve thermoluminescence and energy storage in phosphors based on cubic lutetium oxide (c-Lu 2 O 3 ). The presence of oxygen vacancies is anticipated in those phosphors. If the dopant is located outside the immediate surroundings of the vacancy site, the resulting optical trap depth is similar to that of the isolated oxygen vacancies (1.6–1.7 eV versus 1.7 eV). If the dopant is one of the four metal cations surrounding the vacancy site, the corresponding trap depth is 2.0–2.1 eV. Using time-dependent density-functional theory calculations, it was found that the excitation of the vacancy-trapped electrons can take two forms: a local excited state at the vacancy site can be formed, or an electron transfer to Hf might occur. With charge compensation in mind, several structures with three defects were analyzed: the dopant cation, the vacancy and an interstitial oxygen (Hf/Zr plus a Frenkel pair). These last two systems with the dopant in a +4 oxidation state and a single electron trapped at the vacancy site correspond to zero total charge, while another electron can be trapped. The vacancy site is expected to trap the electron, not the dopant. The composite defects of the dopant and Frenkel pair are thus considered the most likely electron traps in cubic Lu 2 O 3 :Hf and cubic Lu 2 O 3 :Zr.",

    "abstract": "The magnetic structure of chromium arsenide CrAs is studied with neutron powder diffraction at ambient pressure in the temperature range 1.5–300 K as well as with neutron single-crystal diffraction at 2 K and 0.12 GPa. The material undergoes an anti-isostructural phase transition at T N = 267 K and atmospheric conditions, in which both orthorhombic phases have the same space-group symmetry ( Pnma , Z = 4) but different distortions of the parent hexagonal structure of the NiAs type ( P 6 3 / mmc , Z = 2). The magnetic structure below T N is incommensurate with the propagation vector k = (0, 0, k c ). At ambient pressure, the component k c decreases from k c = 0.3807 (7) at 260 K to k c = 0.3531 (6) at 50 K. Below this temperature, it is basically constant. With increasing pressure at 2 K, k c is also constant within standard uncertainties [ k c = 0.353 (2)]. For the analysis of the magnetic structure, a group-theoretical approach based on the space group of the nuclear structure and its subgroups is used. To avoid falling into false minima in the refinements, a random search for magnetic moments in the models is implemented. In the literature, the magnetic structure has been determined on the basis of powder diffraction data as a double helix propagating along the c axis. Although this double-helical model leads to satisfactory agreement factors for our powder data, it does not reproduce the intensities of the magnetic satellite reflections measured on single-crystal data in a satisfactory way and can therefore be discarded. Instead, several other models are found that lead to better agreement. Each of them is spiral-like with directional components in all three directions and with no spin-density wave character that would cause a non-constant magnetic moment. In all these models, the ordering of the spins is neither a pure helix nor a pure cycloid. Instead, the unit vectors of the spin rotation planes make an angle α, 0° &lt; α &lt; 90°, with respect to the c * direction. The model in superspace group P 2 1 .1′(α0γ)0 s yields the best agreement factors in the refinements of the neutron single-crystal and powder diffraction data. This model is unique as it is the only one in which all the magnetic moments rotate with the same chirality.",

A further split in 1983 yielded three journals, namely Section A: Foundations of Crystallography, Section B: Structural Science and Section C: Crystal Structure Communications. The possibilities for depth and breadth of structural description and discussion have been important features available to authors in Acta Crystallographica Section B. The journal publishes scientific articles related to the structural science of compounds and materials in the widest sense. Knowledge of the arrangements of atoms, including their temporal variations and dependencies on temperature, pressure and other conditions, is often the key to understanding physical and chemical phenomena and is crucial for the design of new compounds, materials and supramolecular devices. Acta Crystallographica Section B is the forum for publication of contributions on these topics. The journal covers scientific developments based on experimental studies as well as those based on theoretical approaches, including crystal structure prediction, structure–property relationships and database analysis.",

However, its validity on other polar materials is still unknown. In this paper we extensively investigated its potential applicability onto 11 AB-type semiconductors by dynamical simulations of CBED. Two key factors during the simulation, the difference between A and B atomic numbers and the sample thickness, are discussed in detail. It was found that this method is efficient to determine the polarity for a sphalerite structure under certain conditions, and, reversely, limited to determine the polarity for a wurtzite structure even though it is very similar to the sphalerite structure.",

The ionic strength, I , for 25 silicate lattices is calculated taking into account both formulations, and the results show that, in every single one of the examples, the ionic strength of the Zintl polyanion is higher than that of the classical model which assigns a formal charge of 4+ for silicon. Our earlier study, firstly applied to the germanate (NH 4 ) 2 Ge [6] [Ge [4] 6 O 15 ] [Vegas &amp; Jenkins (2017). Acta Cryst. B 73 , 94–100] and to the polyanion [Ge [4] 6 O 15 ] 6− equivalent to the pseudo-As 2 O 5 derived from it, explained satisfactorily the charge transfer that takes place in the Zintl compounds. The value of I = ½∑ n i z i 2 for the Zintl polyanion was greater than for the compound as formulated in the classical way. In that article, a meaningful relationship was found between the electron transfers as defined by the EZKC and the ionic strength I of the anion [Ge [4] 6 O 15 ] 6− ≡ Ψ-As 2 O 5 . Because the ionic strength, I , of a lattice is directly proportional to the lattice potential energy, U POT , the higher the I the greater the U POT ; thus it is harder to break up the lattice into its constituent ions and hence the lattice itself is more stable, giving support to the idea that the application of the EZKC and the resulting electron shifts yields structures which are inherently thermodynamically more stable than the starting configuration.",

NaOEt crystallizes in space group P 4 2 1 m , with Z = 2, and the other alkoxides crystallize in P 4/ nmm , with Z = 2. To resolve space-group ambiguities, a Bärnighausen tree was set up, and Rietveld refinements were performed with different models. In all structures, the Na and O atoms form a quadratic net, with the alkyl groups pointing outwards on both sides (anti-PbO type). The alkyl groups are disordered. The disorder becomes even more pronounced with increasing chain length. Recrystallization from the corresponding alcohols yielded four sodium alkoxide solvates: sodium ethoxide ethanol disolvate (NaOEt·2EtOH), sodium n -propoxide n -propanol disolvate (NaO n Pr·2 n PrOH), sodium isopropoxide isopropanol pentasolvate (NaO i Pr·5 i PrOH) and sodium tert -amylate tert -amyl alcohol monosolvate (NaO t Am· t AmOH, t Am = 2-methyl-2-butyl). Their crystal structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. All these solvates form chain structures consisting of Na + , –O − and –OH groups, encased by alkyl groups. The hydrogen-bond networks diverge widely among the solvate structures. The hydrogen-bond topology of the i PrOH network in NaO i Pr·5 i PrOH shows branched hydrogen bonds and differs considerably from the networks in pure crystalline i PrOH.",

The experimental diffraction data in the forms of static structure factors and pair distribution functions are analyzed in reciprocal and real spaces and compared with results of model-based simulations. A new approach to modeling the structure of the disordered phases, taking into account the intermolecular scattering contribution in the form of sharp Bragg peaks, the slowly varying intensity associated with intramolecular correlations and the diffusive component resulting from structural disorder, is applied. In the case of the LQ and OG samples, reverse Monte Carlo simulations are also used. The PC and OTG phases show long-range ordering of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp)-type structure up to 120 Å with random orientation of the molecules. Assuming a rigid molecular skeleton, isotropic free rotations of the molecules about their geometrical center in full and limited angular ranges are generated in theoretical models of the structure. It is demonstrated that the adoption of free rotations of the molecules leads to the best fits to experimental data for each studied phase of levoglucosan. The diffraction patterns of the LQ and OG samples show a relatively sharp first peak originating from quasi-Bragg planes of the densely packed face-centered cubic (fcc) type molecular arrangement. Moreover, the slowly varied intensity component of LQ and OG is practically the same as that of PC and OTG, suggesting that the intramolecular structure of these four phases does not change. Interestingly, structural correlations for the disordered LQ and OG states extend surprisingly far, up to about 50 Å. In addition, for all levoglucosan phases investigated, the paracrystalline disorder imposed on the generated models resulted in better compliance with the experimental data.",

Solid 1 with the space group P 2 1 / n and unit-cell parameters a = 22.160 (6), b = 14.209 (3), c = 24.641 (4) Å, β = 99.10 (2)° and V = 7661 (3) Å 3 resulted in the same crystal structure as that synthesized previously under different conditions by Sun et al. [ J. Mol. Struct. (2005), 741 , 149–153]. Factors directing the reaction, such as product composition and phase stability, were monitored by analysis of the PXRD patterns of the bulk solids obtained under different experimental conditions. The relative proportions of the mixed phases 1 – 3 or their stabilization are highly dependent on the initial Co:Mo molar ratio and the reaction temperature. In particular, an increase in temperature induces the transformation of 1 – 3 into more thermodynamically stable phases formed by one-dimensional coordination polymers [Co(bpy) 2 (β-Mo 8 O 26 ) 0.5 ] n ( 4 ) and [(MoO 3 )(bpy)] n ( 5 ). The crystal structures of 1 – 3 correspond to molecular salts self-assembled by C—H...O—Mo, C...H and H...H intermolecular contacts. A Hirshfeld surface analysis for 1 showed that the C...H and H...H interactions represent an average of 51.8% of the total cation–cation intermolecular contacts. In contrast, these interactions are vastly reduced in 2 (23.0%) and 3 (average 28.5% for both isomers). EPR experiments indicated that the crystal structures of 1 and 3 are paramagnetic, and that for 2 is diamagnetic. The paramagnetism of 3 stems from the in situ formation of [Co(bpy) 3 ] 3+ in a high-spin configuration. The structure-directing properties of the [Co(bpy) 3 ] n + cations in the isolation and self-assembly of concomitant octamolybdate isomers are also described from the viewpoint of crystal engineering.",

The polymorphs are comprised of (Hphen) 2 [H 2 Fe(CN) 6 ] trimers and (Hphen)[(phen) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ][H 3 Fe(CN) 6 ] hexamers connected into two-dimensional (2D) hydrogen-bonded networks through strong hydrogen bonds between the [H 2 Fe(CN) 6 ] 2− and [H 3 Fe(CN) 6 ] − anions.

Aside from the identical 2D hydrogen-bonded networks, the two polymorphs share phenazine stacks comprising both protonated and neutral phenazine molecules. On the other hand, the polymorphs differ in the conformation, placement and orientation of the hydrogen-bonded trimers and hexamers within the hydrogen-bonded networks, which leads to different packing of the hydrogen-bonded layers, as well as to different hydrogen bonding between the layers. Thus, aside from an exceptional number of symmetry-independent units (nine in total), these two polymorphs show how robust structural motifs, such as charge-assisted hydrogen bonding or π-stacking, allow for different arrangements of the supramolecular units, resulting in polymorphism.",

    "abstract": "X-ray diffraction, one of the best techniques to study thermal expansion of crystalline materials, has made it easy to rationalize various properties exhibited by different compounds.Advanced X-ray diffraction techniques significantly contribute to the endeavor of crystal engineers to design a new material with desired properties.Indeed, a crystallographic database is the foremost important tool for a crystal engineer to understand intermolecular interactions between the molecules in crystals.The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) is presently the depository of more than one million crystal structures of organic and metal-organic compounds mostly determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.The CSD is routinely used for different purposes by the crystal engineering community and materials scientists worldwide.This scientific commentary provides a brief insight into thermal expansion of organic molecular crystals with reference to the recent article by Andrew Bond (2021) published in Acta Crystallographica Section B on a CSD survey of thermal expansion in organic molecular crystals.Expansion of material upon heating is a general phenomenon which is commonly known as Positive Thermal Expansion (PTE).This can be simply explained by anharmonic vibration of a diatomic bond with increasing temperature (Evans, 1999).However, an unusual phenomenon occurs when a material contracts upon heating -known as Negative Thermal Expansion (NTE).Unusual thermal expansion may also occur in cases of neither expansion nor contraction of a material which is known as Zero Thermal Expansion (ZTE).While the study of thermal expansion is extremely important to understand the structural safety and accuracy in many engineering fields such as aerospace, civil, electronic engineering and precision instruments, design of materials with desired thermal expansion is highly challenging because the underlying mechanism for NTE varies from material to material.A database study may help in understanding thermal expansion behavior of materials in general.In this context, the article by Bond (2021) addresses the general distribution of coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of specifically organic crystalline compounds by systematic analysis of variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction data available in the CSD.Although the thermal expansion of a large number of inorganic and hybrid materials is known, this study by Bond (2021) focuses on organic crystalline materials for which crystal structures are determined.In order to extract the crystal structures of organic compounds deposited in the CSD, determined at a minimum of two different temperatures, the author has used a Python API and some constraints to focus only on organic molecular crystals.Some of the crystal structures in the extracted data set are inconsistent with the calculation of thermal expansion.This inconsistency arises probably due to the wrong temperature of data collection being reported.It may also happen that the reported structures were determined using different crystals at different temperatures.To avoid this inconsistency it is, therefore, necessary to use the same crystal in the same instrument for data collection by variable-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction to study the thermal expansion of crystalline materials.Bond has used the PASCal program (Cliffe & Goodwin, 2012) to calculate CTE (both volumetric and axial) of non-orthogonal crystal systems.This survey revealed both volumetric and axial PTE of organic compounds in general.There are few exceptions which show unusual thermal expansion including NTE and large PTE (Das et al., 2010).Applying linear fit methodology, this study shows a mean volumetric expansion coeffi-",

B 74 , 165–181] is applied to quartz (SiO 2 ) and its structural analogue germanium dioxide (GeO 2 ). In α-quartz and GeO 2 , the pseudocubes are defined by three length parameters, a PC , b PC and c PC , together with an angle parameter α PC . In β-quartz, α PC has a fixed value of 90°. For quartz, the temperature evolution of parameters for the pseudocubes and the silicon ion network is established by reference to the structural refinements of Antao [ Acta Cryst. (2016), B 72 , 249–262]. In α-quartz, the curve-fitting employed to express the non-linear temperature dependence of pseudocubic length and Si parameters exploits the model of a first-order Landau phase transition utilized by Grimm &amp; Dorner [ J. Phys. Chem. Solids (1975), 36 , 407–413]. Since values of tetrahedral tilt angles about 〈100〉 axes also result from the pseudocubic transformation, a curve for the observed non-monotonic variation of α PC with temperature can also be fitted. Reverse transformation of curve-derived values of [Si+PC] parameters to crystallographic parameters a , c , x Si , x O , y O and z O at interpolated or extrapolated temperatures is demonstrated for α-quartz. A reverse transformation to crystallographic parameters a , c , x O is likewise carried out for β-quartz. This capability corresponds to a method of structure prediction. Support for the applicability of the approach to GeO 2 is provided by analysing the structural refinements of Haines et al. [ J. Solid State Chem. (2002), 166 , 434–441]. An analysis of trends in tetrahedral distortion and tilt angle in α-quartz and GeO 2 supports the view that GeO 2 is a good model for quartz at high pressure.",

    "abstract": "A detailed analysis of the recently published deformation potentials for application in orbital-free density functional theory is given. Since orbital-free density functional theory is a purely density-based description of quantum mechanics, it may in the future provide itself useful in quantum crystallography as it establishes a direct link between experiment and theory via a single meaningful quantity: the electron density. In order to establish this goal, sufficiently accurate approximations for the kinetic energy have to be found. The present work is a further step in this direction. The so-called deformation potentials allow the interaction between the atoms to be taken into account through the help of their electron density only. It is shown that the present ansatz provides a systematic pathway beyond the recently introduced atomic fragment approach.",

For these complex molecular and supramolecular species, single-crystal X-ray crystallography has proved to be the optimal technique for determining full three-dimensional structures in the solid state. These structures are curated and placed in structural databases, the most comprehensive of which (for organic and metallo–organic structures) is the Cambridge Structural Database. A question of increasing importance is how users can search such databases effectively for these structures. Here some of the classes of complex molecules and supramolecules and the challenges associated with searching for them are highlighted. The idea of substructure searches that involve topological searches as well as searches for molecular fragments is developed, and significant enhancements are proposed to substructure search programs that are both achievable and highly beneficial for both the database user community and the broader chemistry community.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical property improvement of M 7 C 3 carbides in hypereutectic Fe–Cr–C hardfacing coating is required for its widespread application and longer service life. Vanadium is a frequently used alloying element, while the effects of V doping on the stability and tensile properties of M 7 C 3 carbide have been rarely reported. In this article, the formation enthalpy, structural stability, anisotropic tensile properties and electronic structure of V-doped M 7 C 3 (Fe 3 Cr 4 C 3 ) carbide were calculated by the first-principles method. The mechanism by which the tensile property of Fe 3 Cr 4 C 3 carbide can be improved by V-atom doping is discussed. The results show that the formation enthalpy (−0.24 eV/atom) of Fe 3 Cr 3 VC 3 carbide is lower than that (0.48 eV/atom) of Fe 3 Cr 4 C 3 carbide, which indicates that the formation of Fe 3 Cr 3 VC 3 carbide is more facile. The absence of an imaginary frequency in the phonon dispersion spectra reveals that the Fe 3 Cr 3 VC 3 carbide model is stable. Compared with Fe 3 Cr 4 C 3 carbide, the tensile strength of Fe 3 Cr 3 VC 3 carbide in the (0001) crystal face is increased from 44.42 to 48.46 GPa and that in the (11 1 1) crystal face is also increased, from 28.99 to 34.19 GPa. The reasons that the tensile property of Fe 3 Cr 4 C 3 can be improved by V doping are the electron redistribution and the formation of stronger bonds in Fe 3 Cr 3 VC 3 carbide.",

The 1/1 cAP, in contrast, was found to be isostructural to the binary 1/1 cAP, YbCd 6 , which is composed solely of the RTH cluster. The refined structure models of the three cAPs exhibit substitutional disorders due to the Mg content that enters into Cd sites of the parent binary cAPs. In addition, in the 2/1 cAPs, the Y3(Er3) site on the third icosahedron shell of the RTH cluster and two positions inside DFP, Y5(Er5) sites, are partially mixed with Mg. Moreover, characteristic positional disorders owing to orientational disorder in the first shell of the RTH cluster is observed in all the three cAPs. A close relationship between the occupational disorder of the Y3(Er3) and Y5(Er5) sites in 2/1 cAPs and the elemental distribution in their first coordination shells is revealed.",

Acta Cryst. E 71 , 281–283; Gaydamaka et al. (2019). CrystEngComm , 21 , 4484–4492]. Both sodium and potassium salt hydrates have channels. However, the structure of the channels, the cation coordination, the protonation (and, respectively, the charge) of the guanine anions, as well as the role of water molecules in the crystal structure are different for the two salt hydrates. In the crystal structures of the potassium salt, the guanine anions are linked via hydrogen bonds into quartets that form open cylindrical channels in a honeycomb framework. Water molecules `line the walls' of the channels, whereas the potassium cations fill the intra-channel space. This contrasts with the structure of the sodium salt hydrate in which guanine anions form channels with water molecules filling in the channel space together with sodium cations coordinating them. The 1D anionic assembly generated through numerous hydrogen bonds and cation interactions with guanine anions and water molecules is energetically the most distinctive part of the structure of the potassium salt hydrate. In the case of the guanine sodium salt, the structure contains purely inorganic polymeric fragments – sodium cations coordinated to a water molecule forming a 1D polymeric structure and guanine anions interconnecting these polymers via hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The structural differences account for the difference in the anisotropy of strain on temperature variation for the two salt hydrates: whereas in both structures the values of the bulk thermal expansion coefficients are similar in the two structures and the major expansion is observed along the channel axes, the degree of anisotropy for the K salt is more than four times higher than that for the Na salt.",

Attention has been paid to propose the simplest possible model, which obeys the necessary N -representability conditions, while accurately reproducing all available experimental data. The deconvolution of thermal effects makes it possible to obtain an experimental static density matrix, which can directly be compared with theoretical 1-RDM (reduced density matrix). It is found that above a 1% statistical noise level, the role played by Compton scattering data becomes negligible and no accurate 1-RDM is reachable. Since no thermal 1-RDM is available as a reference, the quality of an experimentally derived temperature-dependent matrix is difficult to assess. However, the accuracy of the obtained static 1-RDM, through the performance of the refined observables, is strong evidence that the Semi-Definite Programming method is robust and well adapted to the reconstruction of an experimental dynamical 1-RDM.",

This new program is based either on the well known Hansen–Coppens multipolar model ( MOLLYNX -mult) or on a new expansion over a set of atomic orbitals ( MOLLYNX -orb). The main difference between the two models is the basis of the expansion: in MOLLYNX -mult the expansion is over atom centered real spherical harmonics, in MOLLYNX -orb the expansion is over a set of atomic orbitals with which mono and bicentric contributions are calculated. This new approach of MOLLYNX -orb can also be applied to nonmagnetic crystals.

An equimolar mixture of unreacted heliamine and in-situ -generated dicarboxylic acid crystallized in space group P 2 1 / c . The comprehensive study of the obtained crystals shows that the peculiarities of the crystallization process lead to the formation of the salt-cocrystal structure where the dianion interacts simultaneously with two cations forming a chain as the primary structural motif. The neutral molecules of dicarboxylic acid link the dianions of the neighbouring chains, forming a layer as the secondary structural motif. As a result, the stronger hydrogen bonds formed by the neutral molecules play a secondary role in the crystal structure formation.",

By the investigation of single-crystal structures, the synthons, acid–ammonium heterodimer and N ammonium —H...N pyridine between functional groups of 1,2-diphenylethylenediammonium and NA are revealed and further identified using Hirshfeld surface analysis. The utility of the synthons is further demonstrated by making salts with the NA isomer, isonicotinic acid. Here the synthon occurrences in cocrystals/salts of NA (including NA derivatives) and diamine coformers reported in the Cambridge Structure Database (CSD) are compared. The robustness of acid–ammonium heterodimer and N ammonium —H...N pyridine is investigated by a search of the CSD. The NA salts also show their improved solubility in pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 buffer mediums compared with pure NA material.",

The effects of on-site Coulomb interaction, uniform strain and spin–orbit coupling were added to examine the stability of its multiple Dirac cones and half-metallic behavior. Moreover, the thermodynamic properties under different temperatures and pressures were investigated, including the normalized volume, thermal volume expansion coefficient, heat capacity at constant volume and Debye temperature. The thermal stability and the phase stability of this material were also studied via ab initio molecular dynamic simulations and the formation energy of the material, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Multi-component crystals (or redundantly, multi-component co-crystals, as the term is sometimes found in the literature, in spite of the fact that any co-crystal is, by definition, built from several components) is actually a broad area of research.Modification of the physical and chemical properties of the solid phase of a main component by co-crystallization with one or several co-formers is exploited in an increasing number of applications.In this context, those concerning the pharmaceutical industry are (by number, efforts and invested financial resources) the most significant.Less exploited (but no less important) are applications in other fields of research, such in materials science and supramolecular chemistry.It seems quite natural from the synergetic development of fields that, in the near future, advantage will be taken of the advances achieved in crystal engineering, a relatively young field of research where the area of multi-component crystals develops.Hence, getting insights into the relationship between the electronic properties of molecular systems and their organization in space is expected to lead to the deep understanding of molecular recognition and molecular assembling.These are the quantum crystallographic bases of crystal engineering and, therefore, of the future applications of multi-component crystals, going beyond trial-and-error procedures for synthesizing crystals with tailored properties.Under the title of Multi-Component Crystals, the book edited by Tiekink and Zukerman-Schpector aims at providing an overview of some of the theoretical and practical aspects, ranging from fundamentals to applications.It spans over 347 pages and is divided in 14 chapters.Chapters 1 and 2 are devoted to the principles of co-crystal formation (mainly in relation to the pharmaceutical industry) and how this approach can be exploited to overcome the problem of poor solubility of drugs, respectively.Chapter 3 introduces electronic descriptors and tools derived from charge density analysis that, pushing crystal engineering towards a quantum crystallography approach, permit the analysis to go well beyond that based on standard determination of molecular structure and molecular packing.Chapter 4 is dedicated to the use of multi-component crystals to tune photochromism of the N-salicylideneaniline chromophore by varying its molecular conformation under the effect of the intermolecular environment, which changes with coformers.Chapter 5 concerns the self-assembling of quinoline-based compounds to guide the connection of multiple components.Their use in multi-component syntheses is suitable, as they drive their formation through different kinds of interactions (involving competitive synthons) and are effective in the selection of partners.Chapter 6 deals with the formation of multi-component crystals involving N-oxides, which provide a useful range of architectures spanning bifurcated hydrogen-bonding interactions, halogenbonding interactions and bridges between metal ions (to form coordination polymers or metal-organic frameworks).Their polar nature makes them very useful for strengthening the interactions they are involved in and, therefore, for driving molecular assembly.In Chapter 7, several aspects of multi-component crystals, such as synthesis and intermolecular interactions, are discussed upon the application of non-ambient conditions (mainly variable low temperature and/or high pressure).Chapter 8 describes solid-state reactivity and thermal expansion by making use of multi-component crystals.In particular, intermolecular [2+2] photo-dimerization is introduced to discuss how the crystalline proximity of reactive components stimulated by UV light permits the formation of",

The results suggest that, unless there are strong arguments for a different strategy, a good routine procedure might be to optimize the conditions necessary to get the best data from single scans, and then choose a multiplicity of observations (MoO) to utilize the available time fully. Different strategies may be required if the crystal is highly absorbing, is larger than the incident beam, is enclosed in a capillary tube or is unusual in some other way. The signal-to-noise ratio should be used with care, as collecting data for longer or at higher multiplicity appears to give a systematic underestimate of the intensity uncertainties. Further, the results demonstrate that including poor-quality data in a refinement may degrade the result and, in the general case, the accidental omission of reflections has a very small impact on the refinement as long as they are omitted at random. Systematic omission of reflections needs a convincing procedural justification.",

    "abstract": "Ammonium fluoride salts of seven- and eight-coordinated tantalum were grown in the form of well shaped single crystals at different pH of solutions, and their crystal structures were determined by X-ray diffraction. The first one, (NH4)3TaOF6, belongs to elpasolite-type structure (Fm{\\overline 3}m, Z = 4) and is characterized by strong dynamic disorder. The ligand atoms (O and F) are each distributed in three positions (one 24e and two 96j). The tantalum atom is seven-coordinated in the form of a pentagonal bipyramid (PB) and occupies the 4a position without leaving the symmetry center of the polyhedron during its fast reorientation. One of the ammonium groups is tetrahedrally disordered (the nitrogen atom is shifted from the 8c into the 32f site), while the other group in the 4b site forms eight spatial orientations due to disordering of hydrogen atoms in the 96k and 32f positions. Strong dynamic disorder of [TaOF6]3- as a flexible unit is reflected in the IR spectrum at 736 cm-1 and in the 19F MAS NMR spectrum at -51 ppm, indicating a state with synchronous stretching vibrations of Ta-O and Ta-F bonds. Two double ammonium fluoride salts of tantalum, which are formed concomitantly, differ slightly in composition but their crystal structures contain the same polyhedra in the form of a mono-capped trigonal prism (CTP or TPRS-7) and a distorted cube (CU or CU-8) with one vacant vertex. The latter tantalum polyhedron is detected for the first time. The CU polyhedron in one of the modifications of the tantalum double salt splits into two CTPs during a phase transition with decreasing temperature. The presence of oxygen in the compounds is confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy.",

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that ZCP is a two-dimensional porous CP, [Zn 2 (pzdc) 2 (bpy)(H 2 O) 2 ] n , with van der Waals forces as the dominant interaction within its layers forming a 6 3 network. Employing energetic ultrasound irradiation, nanoscale ZCP (nZCP) was successfully synthesized and Eu 3+ ions were incorporated within its host lattice ( Eu@nZCP ). The resulting platform exhibits superior fluorescence characteristics and demonstrates notable optical durability. Therefore, it was used as a dual detection fluorescent sensing platform for the detection of mercury and L-cysteine (L-Cys) in aqueous media through a turn-off/on strategy. In the turn-off process, the fluorescence emission of Eu@nZCP progressively quenches by the addition of Hg II via a photo-induced electron transfer (PET) mechanism. The fluorescence of Eu@nZCP is quenched to establish a low fluorescence background through the incorporation of Hg II . This devised turn-on fluorescent system is suitable for the recognition of L-Cys (based on the strong affinity of L-Cys to the Hg II ion) through a quencher detachment mechanism. This method attained a relatively wide linear range, spanning from 0.001 to 25 µM, with the low detection limit of 5 nM for the sensing of Hg II . Also, the corresponding limit of detection (LOD) for L-Cys is 8 nM in a relatively wide linear range, spanning from 0.001 to 40 µM.",

    "abstract": "Synthesis experiments were conducted in the quaternary system K 2 O–Na 2 O–CaO–SiO 2 , resulting in the formation of a previously unknown compound with the composition K 0.72 Na 1.71 Ca 5.79 Si 6 O 19 . Single crystals of sufficient size and quality were recovered from a starting mixture with a K 2 O:Na 2 O:CaO:SiO 2 molar ratio of 1.5:0.5:2:3. The mixture was confined in a closed platinum tube and slowly cooled from 1150°C at a rate of 0.1°C min −1 to 700°C before being finally quenched in air. The structure has tetragonal symmetry and belongs to space group P 4 1 22 (No. 91), with a = 7.3659 (2), c = 32.2318 (18) Å, V = 1748.78 (12) Å 3 , and Z = 4. The silicate anion consists of highly puckered, unbranched six-membered oligomers with the composition [Si 6 O 19 ] and point group symmetry 2 ( C 2 ). Although several thousands of natural and synthetic oxosilicates have been structurally characterized, this compound is the first representative of a catena -hexasilicate anion, to the best of our knowledge. Structural investigations were completed using Raman spectroscopy. The spectroscopic data was interpreted and the bands were assigned to certain vibrational species with the support of density functional theory at the HSEsol level of theory. To determine the stability properties of the novel oligosilicate compared to those of the chemically and structurally similar cyclosilicate combeite, we calculated the electronegativity of the respective structures using the electronegativity equalization method. The results showed that the molecular electronegativity of the cyclosilicate was significantly higher than that of the oligostructure due to the different connectivities of the oxygen atoms within the molecular units.",

    "abstract": "The magnetic structure adopted by a material relies on symmetry, the hierarchy of exchange interactions between magnetic ions and local anisotropy. A direct pathway to control the magnetic interactions is to enforce dimensionality within the material, from zero-dimensional isolated magnetic ions, one-dimensional (1D) spin-chains, two-dimensional (2D) layers to three-dimensional (3D) order. Being able to design a material with a specific dimensionality for the phenomena of interest is non-trivial. While many advances have been made in the area of inorganic magnetic materials, organic compounds offer distinct and potentially more fertile ground for material design. In particular magnetic metal-organic frameworks (mMOFs) combine magnetism with non-magnetic property functionality on the organic linkers within the structural framework, which can further be tuned with mild perturbations of pressure and field to induce phase transitions. Here, it is examined how neutron scattering measurements on mMOFs can be used to directly determine the magnetic structure when the magnetic ions are in a 2D layered environment within the wider 3D crystalline framework.

The sample was a single-phase orthorhombic kagome-staircase-Ni 3 (VO 4 ) 2 -type structure (space group Cmca ) at both temperatures. The phase purity and morphology was studied using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The refined unit-cell parameters at 299 (3) K are a = 5.93384 (4) Å, b = 11.38318 (7) Å and c = 8.23818 (5) Å, and at 1323 (8) K are a = 6.02077 (7) Å, b = 11.48838 (7) Å and c = 8.32611 (9) Å.

A key feature of the quadruple perovskite structural framework is the complex interplay of multiple magnetic sublattices via frustrated exchange topologies and competing magnetic anisotropies. It is shown that in Er 2 CuMnMn 4 O 12 , this phenomenology gives rise to multiple spin-reorientation transitions driven by the competition of easy-axis single ion anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction; both within the manganese B -site sublattice. At low temperature, one Er sublattice orders due to a finite f - d exchange field aligned parallel to its Ising axis, while the other Er sublattice remains non-magnetic until a final, symmetry-breaking phase transition into the ground state. This non-trivial low-temperature interplay of transition metal and rare-earth sublattices, as well as an observed k = (0, 0, ½) periodicity in both manganese spin canting and Er ordering, raises future challenges to develop a complete understanding of the R 2 CuMnMn 4 O 12 family.",

The diffraction data of a quercetin dihydrate crystal have been measured at 20 (2) K to ultrahigh resolution (0.30 Å) using a synchrotron X-ray source. After meticulous multipolar refinement of the charge density, Fourier residual electron density peaks were identified, particularly at the position of hydrogen atom H15 of the catechol ring. This observation revealed a subtle disorder in the molecule, prompting the modelling of the catechol ring in two positions with occupancy percentages of 98.4% and 1.6% in the anti and syn conformations, respectively. Intermolecular interactions are analysed using Hirshfeld fingerprint plots and enrichment ratios. With the presence of numerous O—H...O hydrogen bonds, the packing shows good electrostatic complementarity between the quercetin molecule and its surroundings. The parallel displaced stacking interaction between two anti -quercetin molecules related by a translation along the a axis is, however, not attractive for its electrostatic contribution. The syn conformation shows more attractive quercetin dimers than the anti one. On the other hand, electrostatic interactions between quercetin and the two water molecules are stronger in the anti conformation. The electrostatic interactions of quercetin with human inositol polyphosphate multikinase were analysed in the structure of the complex found in the Protein Data Bank and compared with those the take place in the quercetin crystal packing.",

The crystal structures have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In agreement to the previous observations, the organic template may contribute to the formation of thiosulfates both as mono- and diprotonated species, but this is the first case where both products are reported for the same organic compound. In both structures 1 and 2 , complex nets of hydrogen bonds involve all cations, anions and water molecules. Comparisons are made to the structures of other thiosulfates containing mono- or diprotonated diamine species.",

    "abstract": "New cocrystals and a salt–cocrystal intermediate system involving the antifungal drug flucytosine (FCY) and various coformers including caffeic acid (CAF), 2-chloro-4-nitrobenzoic acid (CNB), hydroquinone (HQN), resorcinol (RES) and catechol (CAL), are reported. The crystal structures of the prepared multicomponent systems were determined through SC-XRD analysis and characterized by different solid-state techniques. All FCY multicomponent systems crystallize in anhydrous form with different stoichiometric ratios. The cocrystals FCY–HQN, FCY–RES and FCY–CAL crystallize in 2:0.5, 2:0.5 and 3:2 stoichiometric ratios respectively. In contrast, FCY–CAF and FCY–CNB crystallize in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. The FCY–CAF cocrystal is formed via an acid–pyrimidine heterosynthon. Due to the partial proton transfer from the acid group of CNB to FCY, a three-point homosynthon is observed between two FCY molecules and the molecules interact via an N—H...O hydrogen bond between FCY and CNB. In FCY phenolic cocrystals, a single-point O—H...O hydrogen bond is observed. The formation of cocrystals and salt–cocrystal intermediate was further confirmed by difference Fourier map analysis and bond angle differences. Except for FCY–CAL, all the multicomponent systems were reproduced in the bulk scale for further characterization. A detailed Crystal Structural Database search was carried out on the multicomponent systems of FCY with acid coformers and we evaluated the formation of cocrystals/salt based on the Δp K a values, the difference in the bond distances and bond angles. Additionally, the prepared multicomponent systems exhibited hydration stability for one month under accelerated conditions [40 (2) °C and relative humidity 90–95 (5)%].",

The chemical compositions of the crystals are reported from X-ray fluorescence analysis. The crystal structures of EuFe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 and Eu 0.82 La 0.18 Fe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction in the temperature range 25–500 K. A structural phase transition is observed in EuFe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 below 89 K which is related to distortions in the interatomic distances and angles. The most significant of which are for R —O, R —B, R —Fe, Fe—O and Fe—Fe distances, and the angles between the BO 3 triangles and the ab plane. There is no structural phase transition in lanthanum-doped EuFe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 based on specific heat measurements (2.2–101.3 K) and structure analysis (25–500 K), and the temperature dependences of the interatomic distances and angles are smooth. The lengths of the superexchange paths needed for the appearance of a structural phase transition in R Fe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 have been proposed. Negative thermal expansion is observed for both compounds below 90 K, resulting from a growth of the interatomic Fe—Fe distances in the iron chains during cooling. The largest atomic displacement parameters are observed for O atoms (O2), indicating that they have the highest mobility. The magnetic properties of EuFe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 and Eu 0.82 La 0.18 Fe 3 (BO 3 ) 4 were analyzed using Mössbauer spectroscopy in the temperature range 4.5–298 K. Néel temperatures ( T N ) of 34.57 (1) and 32.22 (1) K are obtained based on Mössbauer spectroscopy for the pure and doped crystals, respectively. The maximum specific heat capacity temperature dependence related to the magnetic phase transition for the doped crystal is observed at 31.2 K. A violation of the strict arrangement of antiferromagnetic ordering in the ab plane in the La-doped crystals at low temperatures is suggested. The magnetic contributions of the two structural positions of the iron ions to the Mössbauer spectra could not be distinguished in either pure and doped compounds, regardless of whether they are in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions.",

    "abstract": "The structure of eudidymite is described in light of the extended Zintl-Klemm concept which considers that Na and Be atoms transfer their six valence electrons to the six Si atoms, converting them into Ψ-P which forms a skeleton characteristic of pentels (Group 15 elements) and is similar to that described in the compound (NH4)2Ge[6][Ge[4]6O15] when analysed in the same manner. The Si[4] skeleton is formed of bilayers that are connected through Be2O6 groups which are in fact fragments of the β-BeO structure which bridge the two contiguous Si-bilayers by sharing O atoms. In this context, the Be atoms play a dual role, i.e. on the one hand converting the Si atoms into Ψ-P, on the other hand replicating fragments of its own β-BeO structure. The Be atoms partially reproduce their own structure despite it being enclosed in a more complex network such as in Na2Be2[Si[4]6O15]·H2O. Calculations of the ionic strength I considering Si as Ψ-P is energetically more favourable than when I is calculated on the basis of tetravalent Si in the silicate, justifying this new approach of developing the theory of pseudo-structure generation. This approach offers a major new development in the study of crystal structures.",

The AC conductivity was measured using impedance spectroscopy, in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 1 MHz, at temperatures 260 K < T < 400 K and pressures 0.1 MPa < p < 500 MPa. On the basis of the impedance spectra, carefully analyzed at different thermodynamic conditions, the p-T phase diagram of the crystal is constructed. It is found to be linear in the pressure range of the experiment, with the pressure coefficient value dTs/dp = -0.023 K MPa-1. The hydrostatic pressure effect on proton conductivity is also presented and discussed. Measurements of the electrical conductivity versus time were performed at a selected temperature T = 352.3 K and at pressures 0.1 MPa < p < 360 MPa. At fixed thermodynamic conditions (p = 302 MPa, T = 352.3 K), the sluggish solid-solid transformation from low conducting to superionic phase was induced. It is established that the kinetics of this transformation can be described by the Avrami model with an effective Avrami index value of about 4, which corresponds to the classical value associated with the homogeneous nucleation and three-dimensional growth of a new phase.",

The molecular conformation, particularly the torsion angle between aromatic rings has been extensively studied both in the solid as well as in the liquid state. The results show that the compounds appearing as rigorously planar in the solid present instead a twisted conformation in the melt. The solid versus melt issue strongly suggests that the reasons for planarity are to be found in the packing restraints.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals a 26-membered butterfly-type metallomacrocycle [Zn2(didp)2]. One m-bdc2- ligand bridges [Zn2(didp)2] units to form a laterally non-symmetric [Zn2(didp)2(m-bdc)] metallocryptand with an exo-exo conformation. Another crystallographically independent m-bdc2- functions as a secondary synthon to bridge discrete metallocryptands into a 1D zigzag chain architecture. Undoubtedly, the choice of two matched ligands in this work is crucial for metallocryptand construction and structure expansion. Interestingly, a rare helical chain with two flexures in one single L and/or R strand is observed. Another important feature is the C-O...π interactions, by which the dimensionality extension of (1) can be induced. Fluorescence measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the emission of (1) can probably be attributed to ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT).",

The crystal structure, determined at 100 K, reveals that the complex occupies 422 site symmetry, which is compatible with the molecular symmetry of the container but not of the fullerene molecule, which has only 222 symmetry. The additional crystallographic symmetry leads to a complicated but discrete disorder, which could be resolved and modelled using advanced features of the existing refinement software. Solid-state NMR measurements at 184-333 K indicate that the thermal motion of C60 in this temperature range is fast but has different activation energies at different temperatures, which was attributed to a phase transition, which was confirmed by DSC. Intriguingly, the activation energy for reorientations of C60 in the solid state is very similar for the free and encaged molecules. Also, the rotational diffusion coefficients seem to be very similar or even slightly higher for the encaged fullerene compared to the free molecule. We also found that chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) is not the main relaxation mechanism for the 13C spins of C60 in the studied complex.",

Natural Quasicrystals: The Solar System's Hidden Secrets, by Luca Bindi, tells the story of the search for quasicrystals that occur naturally as minerals, and proposes a plausible explanation for how, and surprisingly where, they may have formed.Allow me to begin with a quick recap of post-Shechtman terminology.A crystal is a structure possessing long-range order in the positions of its atoms, indicated by the presence of Bragg peaks in its diffraction diagram (p.928 in IUCr, 1992;Lifshitz, 2007).Crystals may or may not be periodic.Quasicrystals are quasiperiodic crystals (Levine & Steinhardt, 1986) that are explicitly aperiodic (Lifshitz, 2003).They lack periodicity, but they are crystals nevertheless.Icosahedral or decagonal crystals cannot be periodic.Cubic crystals, on the other hand, may or may not be periodic.The simplest icosahedral crystals, those whose Bragg peaks are indexed by six integers, are classified into three Bravais classes (Rokhsar et al., 1987): simple (or primitive) icosahedral (si), bodycentered icosahedral (bci), and face-centered icosahedral (fci).How surprising is the existence of quasicrystals in general?When Dan Shechtman discovered the first quasicrystal (Shechtman et al., 1984) it shattered the prevailing paradigm that all crystals were periodic, and ushered a bona fide Kuhnian scientific revolution (Kuhn, 1962).Today, almost four decades later, aperiodic crystals are found almost everywhere, and while their realization in new contexts and novel physical systems is exciting as ever, and often provides important insight, it is hardly surprising.It is in this context that one should consider the search for quasicrystalline minerals.Years ago, a group of scientists led by Paul Steinhardt, who would eventually become the author's collaborators, embarked on a quest to find such minerals, by searching through scientific databases and issuing a public call to curators of mineral collections worldwide.The search eventually led to a 4 mm rock in the collection of Bindi's home institute, the Museo di Storia Naturale of the Universita `degli Studi di Firenze (in Italy).The sample originated from the Khatyrka region of the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia.It consisted of light-colored material on its exterior, surrounding a dark substance, consisting mainly of khatyrkite and cupalite (metallic alloys of copper and aluminium), with tiny granules of the sought-after quasicrystal, which was given the mineral name 'icosahedrite' for its icosahedral point-group symmetry.Ensuing analysis established that the granules were face-centered icosahedral (fci) crystals with the familiar composition of Al 63 Cu 24 Fe 13 -the first thermodynamically stable quasicrystal ever discovered (Tsai et al., 1987, Calvayrac et al., 1990).Further analysis of the sample showed traces of stishovite, a polymorph of SiO 2 that usually forms at very high pressures and temperatures, as well as a distribution of oxygen isotopes that indicated that the sample might be of extraterrestrial origin.These and other details led to the hypothesis that the quasicrystalline mineral was formed through a high-pressure and high-temperature shock, generated by a hypervelocity impact of asteroids in outer space -a truly spectacular event that may have taken place as early as when the solar system itself was forming, around 4.5 billion years ago, hence the title of the book.",

Inclusion of 4f electrons near the Fermi level may boost the Seebeck coefficient, which is essential for high thermoelectric performance. In this study, Ce was successfully substituted for Ba on the guest atom sites in the type-I clathrate Ba8-x Ce x Au y Si46-y and the material was characterized using high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data measured from 100 14;K to 1000 14;K to investigate potential structural implications of the inclusion of a 4f element. The thermal expansion and bonding of the host structure are not affected by the presence of Ce, as seen from the linear coefficient of unit-cell thermal expansion of 7.30 14;(8) 14;× 14;10-6 K-1 and the average host Debye temperature of 404 14;(7) 14;K determined from the multi-temperature atomic displacement parameters, both of which are similar to values obtained for pure Ba8Au y Si46-y. The anisotropic atomic displacement parameters on the guest atom site in the large clathrate cage populated by Ba surprisingly reveals isotropic behavior, which is different from all other clathrates reported in literature, and thus represents a unique host-guest bonding situation.",

Orthogonal domains of the modulated structure were revealed by a selected-area electron diffraction pattern and the corresponding dark-field transmission electron microscopy images.

Structural analysis and property studies were performed using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, spectroscopic and electrochemical experiments and DFT calculations. The analysis of the molecular and supramolecular architectures showed that the non-covalent interactions developed in the systems, together with the identity of the metal and the amino acid backbone, are determinants for the formation of the complexes and the stabilization of the resultant geometries. The Cu II complexes were tested as candidates for the electrochemical conversion reduction of nitrite to NO, finding that the five-coordinate L-phenylalanine complex is the most suitable. Finally, some insights into the rational design of ligands for the construction of biomimetic complexes are suggested.",

Detailed analysis on the growth of TiO2 on pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti and HfO2 (HFO) surfaces is also given. For Si/TiN/Ti, a pre-annealing procedure led to the transformation of Ti to a TiO2 layer which acts as a seed for aligned growth of TiO2 nanorods. In contrast, Si/HFO does not provide a nucleation site for the formation of aligned nanorods. Various samples were prepared by varying the synthesis conditions, i.e. pre- and post-annealing temperatures and hydrothermal reaction time to figure out the optimum conditions which lead to unidirectional and highly aligned nanorods. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to study structural, morphological and optical properties of synthesized samples. It is found that TiO2 nanorods exhibit a rutile phase on the Si/Ti/TiN and Si/HFO substrates, but highly oriented vertical growth of nanorods has been observed only on pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti substrates. On the other hand, TiO2 nanorods form dandelion-like structures on Si/HFO substrates. Growth of vertically oriented TiO2 nanorods on Si/TiN/Ti is attributed to the TiO2 seed layer which forms after the process of pre-annealing of substrates at a suitable temperature. Variation in hydrothermal reaction time and post-annealing temperature brings further improvement in crystallinity and morphology of nanorods. This work shows that the pre-annealed Si/TiN/Ti substrate is the optimal choice to achieve vertically oriented, highly aligned TiO2 nanorods.",

The first target is to obtain the required dimensional criteria and second, to achieve the ideal mechanical response toward the application. This is currently accomplished through years of knowhow combined with an academic background of materials science and engineering. Since metals are polycrystalline materials, the several rotations of the crystals, the preferred orientation also known as texture, and their interactions, are crucial characteristics that are directly correlated to the final response of the material, and one could apprehend its thermomechanical prehistory as well as predict is behavior. Different atomic arrangements act differently texture-wise therefore in the current review article, the evolution of the microstructure and the crystallographic texture through the thermomechanically rolling process especially of Al alloys for packaging applications is analyzed. The crystallographic texture evolution in 3xxx Al alloys in different processing routes is presented and compared to the anisotropic effects occurring during deep drawing. The earing phenomena in Al alloys are correlated to the produced texture and therefore their understanding is crucial in order to highlight the importance of texture control throughout the thermomechanical process.",

The indirect band gap of the Mo 2 CF 2 semiconductor can be engineered by controlling the number of layers where the band gap energy changes from 0.278 eV for the monolayer to 0.249 eV for the trilayer nanosheet. The decrease in band gap energy in the multilayer is due to interlayer coupling, which splits the bands according to the number of layers. Mo 2 CF 2 behaves as a metal with an anomalous dispersion and high optical conductivity at incident photon energies of 0.68–2.19, 3.49–6.68 and 7.30–8.31 eV. It has a relatively low reflectivity and is absorbing over a broad range of photon energies from about 0.429 (2890), 0.387 (3204) and 0.345 eV (3594 nm) for the monolayer, bilayer and trilayer nanosheets, respectively, achieving peak absorption in the vacuum ultraviolet region at about 7.9 eV (157 nm). The optical properties of Mo 2 CF 2 can likewise be tuned by varying the number of layers.

The anion channel is defined by a face-sharing array of nearly regular Ca octahedra, which run along c , together with flat O3 trigonal antiprisms that are concentric with the Ca octahedra and highly oblate in [001]. The position of the channel anion in Ca 5 (VO 4 ) 3 Cl is split into two at [0, 0, ±0.1691 (6)] with half occupancies. Dynamic disorder among these two positions is suggested from a saddle-shaped electron density distribution through the Ca regular triangle, i.e. the shared face of the Ca octahedra at z = ¼. The position of Cl − was too close to Ca 2+ under bond-valence consideration.

    "abstract": "Pseudoatom databanks, collections of parameters from the multipole model of electron densities for various atom types, are used to replace the Independent Atom Model with the more accurate Transferable Aspherical Atom Model (TAAM) in crystal structure refinements. The databanks are also employed to reconstruct the electron density of a molecule, crystal or biomacromolecular complex in a fast yet accurate way and compute various properties such as the energy of electrostatic interactions, for example. A even faster but similarly accurate model for estimations of electrostatic energy exists called aug-PROmol [Bojarowski, Kumar &amp; Dominiak (2016). ChemPhysChem , 17 , 2455–2460]. A model analogous to aug-PROmol cannot be built from the current pseudoatom databanks, as they perform badly when truncated to the monopole level. Here, new strategies for multipole model refinements were sought, leading to better parametrization at the monopole level. This would allow the creation of a pseudoatom databank in a single route of model parametrization, which would be suitable for both crystal structure refinement and rapid electrostatic energy calculations. Here it is shown that the cumulative approach to multipole model refinements, as opposed to simultaneous or iterative refinements of all multipole model parameters ( P v , κ, P lm , κ′), leads to substantially different models of electron density. Cumulative refinement of two blocks of parameters, the first with P v and κ and then the second with P lm and κ′, leads to the P v κ| P lm κ′ model having promising properties. The P v κ| P lm κ′ model is as good as the University at Buffalo DataBank (UBDB) in X-ray structure TAAM refinements and electrostatic energy estimations, especially for less polar molecules. When truncated to the monopole level, the P v κ model has a chance to replace aug-PROmol in fast yet accurate electrostatics energy calculations, although some improvements in κ parametrization for polar functional groups are still needed. The P v κ model is also a source of point charges which behave similarly to restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charges in electrostatic interaction energy estimations.",

The monoclinic MBE and MIE crystals are found to be isostructural. They are stable, in the investigated regimes, i.e. down to 100 K/0.1 MPa and up to ∼295 K/3.7 GPa, without undergoing any symmetry or phase change. Both the contraction and compression is mainly noted for the intermolecular separation distances. The Hirshfeld surface analysis of intermolecular contacts clearly shows the nature of occurrence and hierarchy of interactions pointing out the role played by Br/I...Br/I contacts, in particular at ambient temperature and high-pressure conditions. The preferences for the formation of intermolecular contacts in MIE are more pronounced and do not require such extreme conditions as in the case of MBE . It is notable that the Br/I...Br/I and Br/I...H contacts could be basically classified as type-I interactions.",

    "abstract": "A rationalization of the alternative crystal structures adopted by a given molecular compound or by a set of substitutionally related molecular compounds is provided by reference to the five known polymorphs of sulfathiazole and 16 substituted 2-benzyl-5-benzylidene cyclopentanones (BBCPs), respectively. Two-dimensional (2D) packing fractions (φ 2D ) take space-group symmetry into account, with a clear demarcation of closed-packed zones (CPZ) and molecular junction zones (JZ) in all Z ′ = 1 structures. Representation of the molecules as two linked rods allows a concise treatment of conformation and rapid visualization of crystal packing. Combined with calculations of intermolecular potential energies, the rod method provides insight into the stabilization mechanisms of alternative polymorphs. In sulfathiazole, the primary factor is to obtain satisfactory hydrogen bonding, with close packing a secondary consideration. In BBCP derivatives, by comparison, close packing is the primary mechanism of stabilization. Whereas the 2D structures arising in CPZ can be analysed as tessellations of molecular-based cells, a method based on 2D Dirichlet cells is required for the JZ. These are calculated from the centroids of the molecular envelopes in high-symmetry planes. It is shown that these centroid coordinates, when combined with space-group symmetry and unit cell coordinates, provide a concise parameterization of all structures containing JZ. It is anticipated that this parameterization may be exploited to predict such crystal structures from powder diffraction data.",

    "abstract": "Solid State Materials Chemistry is a very welcome book written by four of the most renowned solid-state chemists of our time, with undergraduate and graduate chemistry students in mind.This makes the book a unique resource to enter into the complex and fascinating chemistry and physics of matter in the solid state without having to deal with the most complex physical and mathematical details.The book offers intuitive explanations of some of the most complex phenomena of the solid state, relating them to simpler molecular chemistry observations, which are closer to the knowledge of an average chemistry undergraduate or recent graduate.Its fifteen chapters (see details below) cover from the basics of crystal structure and physico-chemical properties of the solid state to many of the most relevant applications that are under development nowadays based on solid materials.Each chapter discusses very didactically one specific topic; this is introduced and intuitively expanded to allow the reader to understand the main concepts, without resorting to detailed mathematical description, unless unavoidable.In order to keep the interest of the reader without perturbing the line of reasoning of the chapters, the text is adorned with short 1-2 page boxes containing details of one specific material (Materials Spotlight), a synthesis procedure (Synthetic Methods), a characterization technique (Characterizations), or a difference between nanoscale and bulk properties (Nanoscale Concepts) where interesting facts related to the chapter are introduced.In addition to the discussed topics, completed with mostly up-to-date references to relevant scientific literature, a section on further reading is provided, for the interested reader to delve deeper into the topics of each chapter.Many of these reading suggestions allow entry into the physical and mathematical details of the topic, avoided in the main text, or into more details of very specific systems.The authors explicitly highlight that students learn by practice; accordingly, each chapter ends with a list of no less than a dozen of problems and exercises that in some cases allow the reader to expand their understanding of topics discussed lightly in the text.Solutions to the problems and digital versions of the figures are also provided online for lecturers to use.The first six of the 15 chapters are devoted to describing basic and general concepts that are used sparingly in the following nine chapters, targeting specific properties of the materials.Chapters 7 to 15 also have a specific introduction where some in-depth discussion is included to allow the reader to catch the essence of the main topic discussed.Appendices A to J expand on some very specific but important ideas such as molecular and crystallographic symmetry, specific nomenclature, bond-valence parameters, magnetic properties and behavior of matter under a magnetic field.Chapter 1 deals with the structure of crystalline materials.It starts by describing translational and rotational symmetry in a periodic crystal in order to later define crystallographic point groups, Bravais lattices and finally space groups.The approach emphasizes the periodic nature of crystals and how this periodicity influences atomic connectivity and ultimately stoichiometry.Crystal structures are grouped based on closest packings and bonding networks; modifications caused by ordering different atomic species or expanding the networks of connected atoms are used to describe binary and ternary compounds.Databases devoted to crystal structures are mentioned.Appendices A and B expand on the Introduction in Chapter 1 with more details on point and space groups, respectively.Unfortunately, the 5th (print)",

The known 1 k -structures based on the single propagation vector [½ ½ ½] for the parent paramagnetic space group Fm 3 m are forced to have monoclinic magnetic symmetry and are not possible in rhombohedral symmetry. However, the monoclinic distortions from the rhombohedral crystal metric allowed by symmetry are very small, and the explicit monoclinic splittings of the diffraction peaks have not been experimentally observed. We analyse the magnetic crystallographic models metrically compatible with our experimental data in full detail by using isotropy subgroup representation approach, including rhombohedral solutions based on the propagation vector star {[½ ½ ½], [−½ ½ ½], [½−½ ½], [½ ½ −½]}. Although the full star rhombohedral R I 3 c structure can equally well fit our diffraction data for NiO, we conclude that the best solution for the crystal and magnetic structures for NiO and MnO is the 1 k monoclinic model with the magnetic space group C c 2/ c (Belov–Neronova–Smirnova No. 15.90, UNI symbol C 2/ c .1′ c [ C 2/ m ]).",

    "abstract": "Plasmonics is a field of study that explores the interaction of light waves and metallic surfaces, and the resulting electron density waves that can be generated from this interaction.The resulting electron density wave that propagates along the surface of the metal is referred to as a surface plasmon polariton, or a surface plasmon.Surface plasmons present many applications.They can be used to control colours of materials, as illustrated by the historic stained glass of medieval cathedrals.In this case, the colour is given by metal nanoparticles which interact with light.Surface plasmons also play a role in Wood's anomalies in light reflection from a metal diffraction grating, observed in 1902, or in surface-enhanced Raman scattering, observed in 1974.Later, the field of plasmonics exploded when it was shown that tiny metallic structures can enable optical circuitry at the nanoscale, and that an array of nanoscale holes in a thin metal film can exhibit extraordinary optical transmission.New exciting pathways to control light in ultra-compact geometries have been opened by implementation of active plasmonic devices in addition to passive metallic lightconcentration structures.Among these recent achievements are plasmonic nanolasers or spasers, as well as plasmon-enhanced light-emitting diodes, detectors, solar cells and single quantum emitters.All these applications rely on the effects of light-matter coupling in nanostructures, including semiconductors and metals, or other conducting materials such as degenerate semiconductors, semimetals or graphene.Furthermore, strong coupling between surface plasmons and excitons has been observed in plasmonic cavity structures, including both organic and inorganic semiconductors.The book Plasmonic effects in metal-semiconductor nanostructures focuses on the performance of plasmonics related to semiconductor metal nanostructures.The purpose is to give a general view of electromagnetic and quantum phenomena emerging in metalsemiconductor plasmonic structures, ranging from basic physical theory to the practical engineering applications such as single-photons sources, nanolasers, ultra-compact modulators, and so on.After a first chapter which describes the milestones of plasmonics and the scope of the book, the content is divided into three parts.The first part (fundamentals) starts with the foundations of metal-semiconductor plasmonics.It contains general information on plasmonic effects in metal structures, as well as electronic and optical properties of semiconductor structures, acting as building blocks of the devices of active plasmonics.The second part (materials) describes characteristics of particular materials, both conducting and semiconducting, which can be of value for the design of hybrid plasmonic structures.The third part (metal-semiconductor nanostructures) describes the existing theoretical approaches to the description of light-matter coupling in metal-semiconductor structures and presents proof-of-concept experimental observations.This part is essentially devoted to the practical applications of active plasmonics.Chapter 2 (electrodynamics of metal structures) outlines basic ideas and definitions of classical electrodynamics, focusing on the propagation of plane waves, the boundary conditions between two media, and the derivation of the dielectric function of the free electron gas in the framework of the Lorentz oscillator model and the Drude theory.A detailed presentation of the various types of plasmons is given, including the bulk",

    "abstract": "This book compiles 30 300 acronyms and abbreviations from the three fields of: (1) physical analytical methods, and equipment; (2) preparation techniques, building units, and structures; (3) crystals and materials. The acronyms are listed in alphabetical order in tabular form within the three columns ‘acronym’, ‘code’ and ‘english translation; german translation’. The code (greek letters d, , ) allows for the assignment to the categories ‘analytical methods and phenomena’, ‘equipment’, ‘terms’ for the field (1), ‘preparation techniques and phenomena’, ‘functional and structural units’, ‘electronic signal processing and techniques’ for field (2), and ‘crystals’, ‘materials’ for field (3). Some acronyms have more than one distinct meaning which are all listed in alphabetic order, e.g. for the acronym AP one finds 42 translations, ranging from ‘absorbable organic halogen; absorbierbares organisches Halogen’ to ‘all points; alle Punkte’ and ‘azimuthal projection; azimutale Projektion’ all in the category ‘terms’. As can be inferred from this example, the author does not want to prioritize or critically evaluate the acronyms, but has the intention to simply list them and provide a database for the helpless reader in front of (sometimes certainly useless) abbreviations. Completeness is not claimed by the author acknowledging the ever increasing number of such acronyms. However, the listing is quite extensive and there is a good chance of finding the acronym one is puzzled by. I agree with the author that compared to searching online for the meaning of an acronym, which often returns a flood of results, the book has the advantage of limiting explanations to those relevant to the three fields listed above. Furthermore, due to the alphabetical organization access within the book is fast. Overall this book is certainly useful to those who repeatedly encounter unexplained acronyms. It might be especially helpful for researchers needing to access literature outside their own discipline and thus often confronted with unfamiliar ‘language’.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, interest in minerals is widespread and the results of mineral sciences are a necessary background not only in classical Earth science but also in materials, biological, forensic, geophysical and other branches of sciences. The author is well known for his ‘molecular scale studies of mineral surfaces including interactions with microbial species, and applications of such studies to problems of Earth resources (including mineral extraction technologies) and the environment’, as one can read on the web site of the School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at the University of Manchester (http://www.seaes.manchester.ac.uk/people/staff/profile/?ea=david. vaughan). In this pocket book David J. Vaughan has done an outstanding job presenting complex notions in simple terms and providing examples to which the reader can relate. Following his research interests, he combines classic mineralogy together with aspects such as the role of minerals in the living world and environment, going through modern aspects of analytical methods. The output is an unconventional but very appealing presentation of mineralogy aimed at the amateurs and anyone interested in minerals, even if some basic knowledge of chemistry and physics is required. This introduction to mineralogy could also be a quick and easy lecture for those students looking for inspiration to focus their attention on different aspects of modern mineral sciences. The book, well illustrated with greyscale drawings and images, is divided into seven chapters, and throughout terms are defined in an exhaustive way. Unfortunately, any colour image is used to better illustrate thin section photos, crystal structures and geological sketches; the quality of the book would have been improved using a few colour images. The first chapter presents the basics of mineralogy and crystallography. It serves as a quick refresher if the reader’s notions of mineralogy are rusty. Chapter 2 reviews analytical methods currently used to characterize mineral species, going from the principle of classic polarizing microscopy to more recent and powerful techniques, such as electron microscopy; some principles of X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy are also refreshed. Chapter 3 is a very short course on geodynamics, relating minerals to their genesis and their impact on different tectonic environments; a short part is dedicated to high-pressure experiments that allow scientists to understand the behaviour of minerals under conditions not directly accessible, such as those occurring in the Earth’s interior. Chapter 4 introduces the cycling of minerals at, or very near, the surface of the Earth, particularly under weathering conditions. This is used as a starting point to present the latest frontiers of mineral sciences touching biological and environmental aspects, such as the role of nano-particles, nano-minerals and aerosols, including their peculiar physical and chemical properties in terms of surface and interface interactions. Chapter 5 approaches other very relevant and fashionable arguments, such as biominerals and bio-mineralogy. The author’s approach is extremely clear and the descriptions of how the biological world (organisms) can produce mineral phases not belonging to the classic geological processes are clearly defined. Chapter 6 discusses minerals as resources, taking into consideration all the major aspects of different mineral sources and properties, how mineral deposits form and how and why these resources are exploited.

    "abstract": "Almost three centuries have passed since Henckel's monumental work on pyrite (Henckel, 1725(Henckel, , 1757)).The new book by David Rickard, world authority on sulfide chemistry, geochemistry, geomicrobiology, biogeochemistry and ore geology, is a most welcome state-of-the-art report about this humble but fascinating mineral.As stated in the preface, the book targets a popular rather than an academic audience; the latter is referred to the impressive research monograph on sulfides published three years before (Rickard, 2012).Nevertheless, a wide-ranging basic education spanning from chemistry to physics, from geology to biology, is necessary to get the most from this comprehensive text in which the author has summarized an impressive amount of data and knowledge.The preface is followed by a prologue, which sets the landscape where pyrite will be hunted in all its aspects in the ten chapters which compose the book.Each chapter is complemented by a series of notes that go beyond the simple bibliography.The journey ends with an epilogue, followed by an extensive (17 pages) index.The book also includes the colour versions of 16 figures printed as four colour plates just before page 203.As clearly stated in the Prologue, this book aims at demonstrating a thesis: pyrite has accompanied and even shaped our civilization since its beginning, not only in the extractive metallurgy, to recover the various metal impurities, but also for its use as a source of sulfur for the black powder (army industry) and of sulfuric acid used in chemicals (e.g.fertilisers), the textile industry (vitriols used as mordants) and pharmaceuticals (alums).It has even contributed to the evolution of early life, as described by the iron-sulfur world model (Wa ¨chtersha ¨user, 1992); it keeps providing us with fundamental pieces of information about the history of the Earth and can be used to predict the future changes in the environment, noting that human activity has increased the rate of pyrite oxidation, making the environment more acidic.These may overall sound like overstatements, but the journey in the sulfidic ocean that the reader undertakes by opening this book should convince him of the primary role played by this mineral in the major events of our planet.The analysis is really a 360 approach, including an historical analysis of pyrite nickname 'Foole's Gold' (the archaic spelling emphasizing the ancient root of this naming) that dates back to the false attribution of pyrite crystals as gold already at the time of the Sumerian civilization.More recently, this same confusion led to the first European settlement in the New World, which was established precisely in the quest for gold, which turned out to be pyrite.This historical approach is complemented by detailed philological analyses -which include the reasons why sulfur has changed to sulfur -of the Sumerian, Arabic, Akkadian, Persian, Greek and Chinese names.The origin of the name pyrite is traced back to the clay tablets produced by the Sumerians and emphasis is put on the long confusion with the term marcasite, often used in jewellery to indicate pyrite, but which indicates the polymorph (actually, polytype) metastable at ambient conditions.We learn that up to Henckel (1725, 1757) the presence of iron escaped to most investigators, even Agricola mentioning an ore of sulfur and 'stone'.The alchemical description is taken only in its literal meaning, and thus obviously severely criticized, ignoring its role of secret language under which ancestral esoteric practices were hidden to escape the Catholic repression (Evola, 1931(Evola, , 1999)).",

    "abstract": "Crystallography and Mineralogy (kesshogaku kobutsugaku), 11th volume in the series Introduction to Modern Earth Science published by the Japanese company Kykoritsu, is a small textbook composed of 11 chapters, three appendices, two appendix tables and one plate, that clearly targets students and young researchers in Earth and Planetary Sciences with a practical approach to the investigation of mineral samples. Given the small size of the book, the topics are necessarily presented in a rather concise way and selected from what could have been a wider choice. The text is well written with a pedagogical approach: a beginner reading this book will have a rather clear idea of the general features of the samples and of what information (s)he may get from the main experimental techniques: for a more in-depth approach one will however need to move to more specialistic textbooks. The first two chapters, which span only seven pages, summarize the type of samples that are the focus of the treatment and the techniques used for their chemical and structural investigation. Geometric crystallography is the object of chapter 3 (‘geometry and symmetry of a crystal’, 18 pages), which is the weakest in this book. It makes constant reference to the 1972 edition of International Tables for X-ray Crystallography; for a text appearing in 2015, the choice of such an outdated reference is hard to understand and certainly not justified. A number of imprecisions affect this chapter which, because of the very limited space, reduces to little more than a list of definitions. Note in Table 3.1 we read about a ‘trigonal lattice’ (sampo koshi), which simply does not exist, trigonal being a word reserved for a crystal system: the ‘other’ lattice in the hexagonal family is rhombohedral (hishigata koshi). On the same page, we read that the symmetry of the lattice leads to a classification in a crystal system (shkokei), which is untrue, the result being lattice systems (koshikei). The same mistakes are repeated on page 18, whereas the figure on p. 19 correctly shows a rhombohedral cell: the contradiction should be selfevident. On p. 12 the definition of geometric element is incorrectly applied to the symmetry element. In the next page a curious listing of eight ‘independent symmetry elements’ is given, which does not make much sense. Firstly, if the list really concerns symmetry elements, as suggested by the fact that 3 and 6 are missing (being considered the combination of 3 and 1 and of 3 and m perpendicular to it, respectively), then the identity should not appear because it obviously has no ‘element’. Secondly, if the list includes symmetry operations instead, as suggested by the presence of the identity, then one could list only 6 and 1, the repeated application of either or both of them generating all the ten types of operations in crystallography point groups. Whatever interpretation is adopted, the statement remains incorrect. Fig. 3.5 in the following two pages gives the stereographic projection of the 32 types of crystallographic point groups where, however, the cubic centrosymmetric groups are given as m3 and m3m instead of m3 and m3m (same problem in Table 1 of the appendix): an unjustifiable remnant of prehistoric times when typographical issues primed over consistency (3 includes 3 as even powers, whereas the opposite is not true). Table 3.3 in the next page gives [100] instead of [110] as the tertiary symmetry direction of tetragonal crystals; furthermore, only one direction (square brackets) is given instead of a representative set of equivalent directions (angular brackets) for cubic and uniaxial crystals, and the direction chosen does not follow international standards: this certainly comes from the questionable decision of choosing as a reference an old mineralogy book by Morimoto et al. (1975) instead of International Tables. No time to breathe, another imprecision follows immediately: the orthographic ISSN 2052-5206",

The ammonium ion and the carboxylate ion in the helix are connected by three hydrogen bonds, the fourth hydrogen bond being formed between the ammonium ion and an external acetyl amino group of the neighboring helical column. The fourth hydrogen bond is formed between the ammonium ion and an external acetyl amino group of the neighboring 2 1 column. Ammonium N -acetyl-DL-alloisoleucinate was revealed to exist as an unstable racemic compound due to conformational similarity between the racemic and optically active compounds in the solid state and was optically resolved by fractional crystallization at 293 K.",

    "abstract": "According to the author, the book 'should find its place in any year of the degree studies in the physical and biochemical sciences' and it 'presumes a background in science and mathematics of approximately A-level standard'.In fact, some more than basic knowledge of chemistry, physics and mathematics is required, such as integral calculus, symmetry notations and thermodynamics (free energy, entropy, enthalpy etc.).Also, many rather special terms are expected to be known, such as 'Fourier space', 'dimension of an irreducible representation' and 'relativistic contraction'.Quantum theory is explained from scratch in Chapter 2 (117 pages), beginning with black-body radiation, Planck's theory, the De Broglie equation and Heisenberg's principle and then becoming quite elaborate with wavefunctions.This is well understandable, provided the reader is well grounded in mathematics.It continues elaborately with molecular orbitals, including delocalized -bonds, multicentre bonds, ligand-field theory, character tables (without explaining the meaning of the character symbols) and briefly with VSEPR theory.Less satisfactory is that explanations are given quite a few times using terms that have not yet been introduced.This is a general didactic deficiency throughout the book.For example, knowledge of the terms p electron and -bonding is required to understand Example 2.6 on p. 47, but the terms are only explained later on pages 70ff.In this case, the mentioned terms can be expected to be known to the reader in the first place, so there is no point in explaining them at all.Chapter 3 (68 pages), 'Molecular compounds', begins with polarization, dipole interactions and intermolecular potentials, again with lots of mathematical formulae, including very briefly some related physical properties like the refractive index.There is a superfluous section on 'vibrational bonding'.After a short discussion of the structure of liquids follows Section 3.12 on the structures of molecular solids.This is restricted to a small, unsystematic and arbitrary selection of a few solid-state structures; organic compounds are essentially presented by overcrowded figures and a superfluous table of bond lengths.The reader is referred to two structure databases, leaving unmentioned the Inorganic Structural Database and Pearson's Crystal Data.The reader is left at a loss with this Section 3.12; it should have been deleted.Chapter 4 (62 pages) is dedicated to ionic compounds, with a main focus on crystal energetics and related topics such as electron affinities, solubilities, ionic radii and heat capacities.The alkali halide and MX 2 structures and their relations to ionic radius ratios are worked out clearly (although in Fig. 4.14 the alleged relationship between the TiO 2 and NaCl type is not perceivable).A section on silicate structures points out their main structural principles, but not going into detail (e.g. the chrysotile structure is mentioned, but not that its silicate sheets are curled to tubes); nothing more recent than W. L. Bragg (1933) is cited (e.g.Libau's systematic book on silicates).Point defects, doping and electrical properties are subjects, including an explanation of how image plates work.Chapter 5 (65 pages), 'metallic compounds', is something for physicists, hardly understandable for chemists.It is focused on physical properties and bonding theory.In parts (e.g.wave-mechanical free-electron theory, p. 291), the reader will have a hard time understanding much unless he or she already knows what is being explained.There are more obscurities, for example: 'species such as Ti 3+ should be a better conductor than...' (p.289); is Ti 3+ a single ion or a solid or what?The chapter also deals with semi-",

    "abstract": "This book, which collects much data at several levels -history, extraction, treatment, production, economy, uses, recycling -for a great number of industrial inorganic substances, starts with a short 2-page introduction, presented as Chapter 1, which includes the significance of distinction of materials as a function of their origin.The first substance of interest, sulfuric acid, is the subject of Chapter 2. Sulfur, its oxides, and the different compounds in which it is present, are listed with selected data attached (history, uses, chemical reactions . . .).Chapter 3 considers several industrial gases (oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, rare gases . . .), and different inorganic compounds involving nitrogen are discussed in Chapter 4, with the same type of data as previously mentioned.Fertilizers based on nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are thereafter discussed in Chapter 5, with particular emphasis on geographic information.Chapters 6 and 7 concern calcium and sodium, respectively, and the compounds involving each of them.Note in the body of Chapter 7, which is devoted to sodium, the curious presence of a paragraph dealing with titanium oxide.This insertion is obviously an error and should be moved to Chapter 14.The case of materials involving fluorine and its compounds (acids, Teflon . . . ) is treated in Chapter 8, while Chapter 9 deals with some substances and materials which are difficult to classify as inorganic or organic (such as carbon black, borax or asphalt).The case of water and its treatments is addressed in Chapter 10.Metals are treated in the following chapters: Chapter 11 for iron and steels (why not cast irons?), Chapter 12 for aluminium and its alloys, Chapter 13 for copper and associated alloys (brass and bronze notably), Chapter 14 for titanium (it is here that the infamous paragraph is lacking), chromium, mercury, gold, silver, lead, tin, the platinum group metals, technetium, tantalum and niobium.Chapters 11-13 are the most substantial in terms of history; the corresponding ore, the industrial techniques of production and refinement, geographic and economic data, the alloys based on the element of interest, and the recycling are all reviewed.Chapters 15 and 16 address the case of the rare or rare-earth elements (e.g.yttrium) and the case of radioactive elements (uranium, thorium).Chapters 17 and 18 concern silicon, and metals and alloys with low density (aluminium, magnesium, titanium, beryllium), aerogels of various types, zeolites, fullerenes, with the same points of interest as before (production, use, recycling).In the two following Chapters (19 and 20) ceramics and hard materials (diamond, nitrides of silicon, boron and carbon, metal borides) are discussed.At the end is only an index, curiously without any general conclusions.Thus this book is interesting, easy to read and illustrated by the presence of tables, graphs, schemes and photographs.A lot of inorganic materials are listed, with short texts and accompanying data of various nature: geographic, economic, schemes of processes, chemical reaction equations and so on (but the information provided is unfortunately often of a different nature material by material, e.g.only geographic, economic . . .for one of the materials and only fabrication processes, chemical reactions . . .for another).However, with only 200 pages of small size with large spaces between lines, and then a",

The bornane and myo -inositol moieties aggregate in distinct layers extending parallel to (001). The myo -inositol rings are connected by a complex hydrogen-bonding network extending in two dimensions, which is disordered in the basic structure and (mostly) ordered in the actual modulated structure.

On heating, the σ 2 -component of the modulation wave vector decreases from σ 2 = 0.1486 (3) at 100 K to σ 2 = 0.1405 (6) at 430 K, which means that the periodicity of the modulation wave increases.

Due to the denser packing, the six-membered ring in the trimer structure should be energetically more stable than the four-membered ring. The triclinic structure is stable at low temperatures.

    "abstract": "Revisiting the structure of uranyl arsenate mineral hügelite provided some corrections to the available structural data. The previous twinning model (by reticular merohedry) in hügelite has been corrected. Twinning of the monoclinic unit cell [ a = 7.0189 (7) Å, b = 17.1374 (10) Å, c = 8.1310 (10) Å and β = 108.904 (10)°], which can be expressed as a mirror in [100], leads to a pseudo-orthorhombic unit cell ( a = 7.019 Å, b = 17.137 Å, c = 61.539 Å and β = 90.02°), which is eight times larger, with respect to the unit-cell volume, than a real cell. Moreover, the unit cell of chosen here and the unit cell given by the previous structure description both lead to the same supercell. A new structure refinement undertaken on an untwinned crystal of hügelite resulted in R = 4.82% for 12 864 reflections with I obs &gt; 3σ( I ) and GOF = 1.12. The hydrogen-bonding scheme has been proposed for hügelite for the first time.",

The crystal structure of the cobaltate is accurately described based on the superspace group C 2/ m (α0γ)00, wherein the positions of Na atoms are most significantly modulated in the monoclinic a direction to form an ordered arrangement. Such a displacive modulation causes a quasi-periodic shift of Na atoms from the centers of the NaO 6 polyhedra between undulated CoO 2 sheets, changing the form of the NaO 6 polyhedron from an octahedral coordination (O) to a trigonal prismatic (P) one, via an intermediate capped trigonal prismatic NaO 7 coordination (C). At the positions where the Na atoms are most significantly shifted, the neighboring Na atoms are located at almost touching distances. However, the occupation factor of Na atoms becomes zero at such positions, yielding Na-deficient sites V Na , sandwiched either between C and P, or C and C-type polyhedra.",

These products are formed in different proportions (D &gt; P &gt;&gt; Z). The path and kinetics of the reaction were monitored step-by-step using crystallographic methods, both under ambient and high-pressure conditions. The reactivity of S-PEATPBB depends strongly on the geometry of the reaction centre and the volume of the reaction cavity. Due to the geometrical preferences making the cyclization reaction easier to proceed, product D dominates over the other products, while the formation of product Z becomes difficult or almost impossible at high pressure. The reaction proceeds with an increase of the unit-cell volume, which, suppressed by high pressure, results in a significant decrease of the reaction rate. The crystal lattice of S-PEATPBB shows high elasticity. The quality of the partially reacted crystal remains the same after decompression from 0.75 GPa to 0.1 MPa.",

In the course of the temperature-dependent single-crystal diffraction experiments, a phase transformation of β-K 3 YbSi 2 O 7 to a novel low-temperature orthorhombic phase (β′-K 3 YbSi 2 O 7 , space group Cmcm ) has been observed at about 210 K. β-K 3 YbSi 2 O 7 is isostructural with K 3 ErSi 2 O 7 , whereas β′-K 3 YbSi 2 O 7 adopts a new type of structure. Both compounds can be built up from a regular alternation of layers of two types, which are parallel to the (001) plane. In the octahedral layer, YbO 6 octahedra are isolated and linked by K1O 6+3 polyhedra. The second, slightly thicker sorosilicate layer is formed by a combination of Si 2 O 7 dimers and K2O 6+3 polyhedra. The boundary between the layers is a pseudo-kagome oxide sheet based on 3.6.3.6 meshes. The phase transition is due to a tilt of the two SiO 4 tetrahedra forming a single dimer which induces a decrease of the Si—O—Si angle between bridging Si—O bonds from 180° (dictated by symmetry in space group P 6 3 / mmc ) to ≃164°. Magnetic characterization indicates that K 3 YbSi 2 O 7 remains paramagnetic down to 2 K, showing no apparent influence of the phase transformation on its magnetic properties. Analysis of the magnetization data revealed the positions of the three lowest crystal field levels of the Yb 3+ cations, as well as the corresponding projections of their angular momentum on the direction of the magnetic field.",

The hybrid crystals 1 – 4 , containing relatively large but different organic cations, are composed of four distinct anionic substructures. They are built up from isolated [BiCl 6 ] 3− octahedra in 1 , from face-sharing bioctahedral [Bi 2 Cl 9 ] 3− units in 3 , from polymeric corner-sharing {[BiCl 5 ] 2− } n chains in 2 and from edge-sharing {[BiCl 4 ] − } n chains in 4 . The distortions shown by the single [BiCl 6 ] 3− polyhedra in 1 – 4 are associated with intrinsic interactions within the anionic substructures and the organic...inorganic substructures interactions, namely, N/C—H...Cl hydrogen bonds. The first factor is the stronger, which is evident in comparison of the experimentally determined geometrical and calculated distortion parameters for the isolated octahedron in 1 to the more complex inorganic substructures in 2 – 4 . The formation of N—H...Cl hydrogen bonds, in terms of their number and strength, is favoured for 1 and 3 containing relatively easily accessed hydrogen-bond acceptors of isolated [BiCl 6 ] 3− and [Bi 2 Cl 9 ] 3− units. The studies of the deviations from regularity of the [BiCl 6 ] 3− octahedra within inorganic substructures were supported by a survey of the Cambridge Structural Database, which confirmed the role played by different factors in the variations in geometry of the inorganic anions.",

The obtained results showed hydrogen bonds with a character intermediate between closed-shell and shared-shell in both crystal structures. The most important hydrogen bonds in (I) are formed between sulfonamide groups, whereas in (II), water molecules play a crucial role as they interconnect 2-aminopyridine and hydrochlorothiazide molecules. Calculations of the optical properties revealed that both materials exhibit large linear birefringence, twice that of calcite. The theoretically predicted second harmonic generation efficiency is four times and five times larger than that of KH 2 PO 4 for (I) and (II), respectively.

    "abstract": "Section B, Michal Kaz ´mierczak and Ewa Patyk-Kaz ´mierczak (2021) provide a comprehensive survey of high-pressure crystal structural depositions in the Cambridge Structural Database (Groom et al., 2016) and offer a valuable perspective on the status of high-pressure research within the field of crystal chemistry.For structural chemists, X-ray crystallographic techniques have been recognized as providing an extremely powerful method for the determination of the structure of matter and, specifically, the arrangement of atoms of a crystalline solid in three-dimensional space.The origin of the field comes from the theoretical work of Paul Ewald who, in collaboration with Max von Laue examined the propagation of X-rays through crystals.Encouraged by Laue, Walter Friedrich and Paul Knipping carried out an experiment where they shone a beam of X-rays at a crystal of zinc blende (ZnS) with a photographic film placed behind it to record the diffraction spots.The interpretation of the diffraction images was determined fully by Lawrence Bragg, who inferred that the diffraction events could be understood in terms of mirror-like reflections from planes within the crystal, which he formulated as the now very familiar 'Bragg's law'.For their work on translating the information recorded on diffraction images to crystal structure determination at atomic resolution Max von Laue and Lawrence Bragg (with his father William Bragg) won the Nobel Prize for Physics on consecutive years, 1914years, and 1915years, respectively (Woolfson, 2018)).This brief period unlocked the use of X-ray crystal structure analysis for scientists working in disparate fields and by 1929 the output of the fledgling X-ray crystallography community was of sufficient volume for the founding of Strukturberichte, to provide a regularly published source of recent crystal structure determinations.Strukturberichte eventually became Structure Reports as an official publication of the International Union of Crystallography until the 1990s.The period also marked the evolution of X-ray crystallography and crystal structure analysis away from its origins in inorganic chemistry.Long-standing questions on the nature of chemical bonding and interactions in organic chemistry were addressed and the structures of a wide range of natural and synthesized molecules were determined.The biological and life sciences also embraced X-ray crystallography and went on to address several dauntingly complex challenges which, in turn, have revolutionized our understanding of life at the molecular level (Groom & Allen, 2014).From 1929 to the early 1960s, crystal structure compilations and references were print based, with both Strukturberichte and Structure Reports joined by several other publications, and by the late 1940s there were growing concerns about the plethora of sources for primary scientific material, which was dubbed 'the information explosion'.In 1964, when computer-based systems became feasible, Olga Kennard was invited to create a 'Crystallographic Data Centre' with funding from the new UK Office for Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) and by the following year she had established the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) at the University of Cambridge.The remit of CCDC was to establish a comprehensive and retrospective database of organic and metal-organic structures determined by both X-ray and neutron diffraction methods.As well as including the bibliographic, chemical and overall crystallographic information, it was, crucially, to include the three-dimensional atomic coordinate data.The resulting Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), the first fully electronic numerical data depository, was later joined by other databases in the early 1970s, such as the Inorganic Crystal",

The molecular structure, characterized by a hexagonal ring of alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms with three hydroxymethyl groups attached to the carbon atoms, could not be unambiguously determined by elemental analysis and 1 H/ 13 C/ 15 N NMR. The molecular structure and conformation were further determined using a combination of vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) and real-space pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. The crystal structure was determined ab initio from laboratory X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) with orthorhombic space group Ama 2 (No. 40) and unit-cell parameters a = 12.1054 (2) Å, b = 13.5537 (2) Å and c = 5.20741 (8) Å. Consistent structure models could be obtained by symmetry-independent PDF and PDF-Rietveld co-refinements. Independent local structure refinements indicate that the most likely deviations from the average structure consist of small tilting and translational distortions of hydrogen-bonded molecular stacks. Thermal analysis (TG/DTA) and temperature-dependent XRPD measurements were also performed to determine the thermal behavior.",

    "abstract": "Quantum refinement has repeatedly been shown to be a powerful approach to interpret and improve macromolecular crystal structures, allowing for the discrimination between different interpretations of the structure, regarding the protonation states or the nature of bound ligands, for example. In this method, the empirical restraints, used to supplement the crystallographic raw data in standard crystallographic refinement, are replaced by more accurate quantum mechanical (QM) calculations for a small, but interesting, part of the structure. Previous studies have shown that the results of quantum refinement can be improved if the charge of the QM system is reduced by adding neutralizing groups. However, this significantly increases the computation time for the refinement. In this study, we show that a similar improvement can be obtained if the original highly charged QM system is instead immersed in a continuum solvent in the QM calculations. The best results are typically obtained with a high dielectric constant (ɛ). The continuum solvent improves real-space Z values, electron-density difference maps and strain energies, and it normally does not affect the discriminatory power of the calculations between different chemical interpretations of the structure. However, for structures with a low charge in the QM system or with a low crystallographic resolution (&gt;2 Å), no improvement of the structures is seen.",

    "abstract": "The book is intended as a problem text for students in inorganic chemistry at the senior undergraduate and beginning graduate level. It is a compilation of 300 problems that had been designed by the authors for teaching inorganic chemistry courses, either as take-home assignments or examination questions. Notwithstanding the focus on structural aspects of inorganic chemistry indicated in the title the scope is much broader. The topics covered comprise Atomic and Molecular Electronic States, Atomic Orbitals, Hybrid Orbitals, Molecular Symmetry, Molecular Geometry and Bonding, Crystal Field Theory, Molecular Orbital Theory, Vibrational Spectroscopy, and Crystal Structure. Yet the central theme running through these topics is symmetry, molecular or crystalline. Helpful appendices, a bibliography with 150 citations, and a subject index complete the text. The origins of the book go back to the early 80s when the first version of this compilation, entitled Problems in Inorganic and Structural Chemistry, was published by T. C. W. Mak, K. Y. Hui, O. W. Lan and W.-K. Li. During decades of practical use it has been revised and updated. The renowned senior authors Thomas Chung Wai Mak and Wai-Kee Li are now Emeritus Professors of Chemistry. In this sequel book their great expertise in inorganic and physical chemistry is complemented by Yu-San Cheung and Kendrew Kin Wah Mak who are teaching physical and organic chemistry at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Indeed, the optimization by generations of students and the extension to further aspects of chemistry resulted in a wide range of clearly formulated, challenging problems along with their solutions and helpful explanations. This mature workbook allows students to profoundly test their knowledge in several essential fields of chemistry. The outstanding quality of the content, the high quality printing and the affordable paperback edition make Problems in Structural Inorganic Chemistry highly attractive for students and instructors especially in inorganic and physical chemistry.",

    "abstract": "This study comprehensively explores the nanostructural properties of two diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP)-based small molecules with different alkyl side groups and their blends with the fullerene derivative PC71BM, using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering synchrotron techniques. Preferentially relative face-on orientation within the larger and more ordered stacking phase of SM1 with its shorter side group (ethylhexyl) was observed in the majority of both pristine and blend thin films, whereas SM2 crystals showed strictly perpendicular orientation. These contrasting crystalline characteristics led to significant differences in the results, from which crystalline structure-performance property correlations are proposed. Thus, the results not only demonstrate important scientific insights into the relationship between molecular structure and crystalline formation but also provide molecular design directions that will facilitate further improvement to the morphology and performance of DPP-based small-molecule solar cells.",

Its low-temperature behaviour has been studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Down to 45 K, the irrational component α of the modulation wavevectors is quite constant varying from 0.2982 (4) (RT), through 0.2955 (8) (120 K), 0.297 (1) (90 K), 0.298 (1) (75 K), to 0.299 (1) (45 K). At 25 K it approaches the commensurate value of one-third [ i.e. 0.332 (3)]: thus indicating that the incommensurate–commensurate phase transition takes place between 45 K and 25 K. The commensurate lock-in phase of K 2 Sc[Si 2 O 6 ]F has been solved and refined with a 3 × 3 × 1 supercell compared with the tetragonal incommensurately modulated structure stable at room temperature. This corresponds to a 3 × 1 × 3 supercell in the pseudo-orthorhombic monoclinic setting of the low-temperature structure, space group P 2/ m , with lattice parameters a = 26.786 (3), b = 8.245 (2) c = 26.824 (3) Å, β = 90.00 (1)°. The structure is a mixed tetrahedral–octahedral framework composed of chains of [ScO 4 F 2 ] octahedra that are interconnected by [Si 4 O 12 ] rings with K atoms in fourfold to ninefold coordination. Distorted [ScO 4 F 2 ] octahedra are connected to distorted Si tetrahedra to form octagonal arrangements closely resembling those observed in the incommensurate structure of fresnoite- and melilite-type compounds.",

    "abstract": "According to the Preface, 'the book aims to be useful for undergraduates', and its title and the list of contents give the impression that this is a textbook for advanced students of chemistry.But that is not the case.Essential concepts of crystal chemistry are not covered at all, such as ionic radius ratios, Pauling's rules, lattice energy, phase diagrams and chemical bonding in solids.Some classes of compounds such as silicates, intermetallics and Zintl phases are completely missing.The conception is not a general building up of knowledge in crystal chemistry, but a notional view at coordination polyhedra and their joining with increasing complexity, reflecting predilections of the author and culminating in results of the author's research.It is inconsistent that some basic crystallographic terms are explained, such as rotations, rotoinversions, screw rotations and glide reflections, while other crystallographic topics are expected to be known.The terms 'symmetry operation' and 'symmetry element' are used frequently, but not explained, and sometimes confused.Crystallographic group theory, cell settings and cell transformations are not a subject.Point groups and their symbols are not really explained and it is (wrongly) claimed that their number is restricted to 32.Space groups, Hermann-Mauguin symbols and Miller indices are explained in a rather terse way.Rotation axes are termed A 2 , A 3 , . . .and rotoinversion axes A 3 3 , A 4 4 , . . . in lieu of the usual symbols.The use of mathematics is restricted to the calculation of interatomic distances.Chapter 1 begins with Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra and how they are joined in simple crystal structures (detailed geometric data follow in an appendix).The primitive cubic packing and the close-packings of spheres are explained together with their interstices.An approach that is repeatedly used throughout the book is to insert atoms at the points of contact of the spheres; this is called a decoration or a substitution of joined polyhedra for spheres, 'keeping the topology'.'Topology' is the all-dominant term in the book, and yet never explained, now and then ambiguous and not quite in accordance with its mathematical definition.The elaborate Chapter 3 (45 pages) gives instructions on how to interpret perspective drawings, projections and crystal data (lattice parameters, atomic coordinates including symmetry-equivalent positions).This illuminating chapter begins with a lengthy explanation of the rutile structure, which is described as a distorted hexagonal arrangement of 'oxygens' with octahedral interstices occupied by Ti atoms.It is not mentioned that the packing of the oxygen atoms is a tetragonal close packing with the coordination number 11.The structure types of CaF 2 , NaCl, NiAs, cubic and hexagonal ZnS, -Al 2 O 3 , -Ga 2 O 3 , CdCl 2 , CdI 2 , MgAl 2 O 4 (spinel), K 2 NiF 4 , ReO 3 , MoO 3 , tungsten bronzes and several others are explained in detail.That includes their space groups, lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, coordination polyhedra, many figures and the description as packings of spheres with occupied interstices.Ample attention is given to the kinds of connectivity of the coordination polyhedra.The superconductors YBa 2 Cu 3 O 8-serve as examples to explain the concept of vacancies.",

A novel phase, with a strongly pseudo-orthorhombic structure, is described as a monoclinic crystal structure established by the study of a pseudomerohedric microtwin. It was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, microprobe analysis and low-temperature X-ray diffraction. The composite crystal structure represents an original framework assembled from Cu-centered polyhedra, AlO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra with channels, which incorporate the Na/Li salt component [(Na,Li)3(Cl,OH)]2+ that ensures electroneutrality of the compound. Layers of strongly corrugated chains of Cu-centered octahedra with shared edges and linked by PO4 tetrahedra are shown to be topologically identical with the layers also built from Cu-centered polyhedra and AsO4/VO4 tetrahedra forming the crystal structure of a fumarolic mineral aleutite, (M0.5Cl)[Cu5O2(AsO4)(VO4)] [Siidra et al.

    "abstract": "The aggregation of molecules is usually associated with a specific type of interaction, which can be altered by thermodynamic conditions. Under normal conditions, the crystal structure of selenourea, SeC(NH 2 ) 2 , phase α is trigonal, space group P 3 1 , Z = 27. Its large number of independent molecules ( Z α ′ = 9) can be associated with the formation of an NH...N hydrogen bond substituting one of 36 independent NH...Se hydrogen bonds, which prevail among intermolecular interactions. Phase α approximates the trigonal structure with a threefold smaller unit cell ( Z = 9), which in turn approximates another still threefold smaller unit cell ( Z = 3). The temperature-induced transformations of selenourea have been characterized by calorimetry and by performing 21 single-crystal X-ray diffraction structural determinations as a function of temperature. At 381.0 K, phase α undergoes a first-order displacive transition to phase γ, with space group P 3 1 21 and Z reduced to 9, when the NH...N bond is broken and an NH...Se bond is formed in its place. Previously, an analogous competition was observed between NH...N and NH...O hydrogen bonds in high-pressure phase III of urea. The lattice vectors along the (001) plane in low- and high-temperature phases of selenourea are related by a similarity rule, while the lattice dimensions along direction c are not affected. This similarity rule also applies to the structures of phase γ and hypothetical phase δ ( Z = 3). The thermally controlled transition between enantiomorphic phases of selenourea contrasts with its high-pressure transition at 0.21 GPa to a centrosymmetric phase β, where both the NH...Se and NH...N bonds are present. The compression and heating reduce the number of independent molecules from Z ′ = 9 in phase α, to Z ′ = 2 in phase β and to Z ′ = 1.5 in phase γ.",

The effects of lanthanum concentration on the phase formation, microstructure and cycloidal spin ordering were studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The crystal structure of the La-doped bismuth ferrite transformed from rhombohedral R3c (x ≤ 0.05) to a mixture of R3c and cubic Pm3m (0.07 ≤ x ≤ 0.15) and finally to a mixture of R3c, Pm3m and orthorhombic Pbam (0.20 ≤ x ≤ 0.30). The Pbam phase, with characteristic porous microstructure shown by microscopy images, was observed in Bi1-xLaxFeO3 compounds for the first time. Based on the Mössbauer spectroscopy, it was found that the cycloidal spin ordering started to disappear at x = 0.07. With increasing La concentration the share of the cycloid decreased from 100% at 0.00 ≤ x ≤ 0.05 to 0% at x = 0.30. At the beginning, for x ≤ 0.02, the anharmonicity parameter, m, of the cycloidal spin ordering was about 0.5, which is typical of a pure BiFeO3 compound. In the range 0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.25, the m parameter was of the order of 0.1, which indicated the practically harmonic character of the cycloid. The structural transition at x = 0.07 was accompanied by a substantial increase in magnetization.",

It shows a paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transition at 253 K and has an incommensurately modulated ferroelectric phase below 137 K. High-resolution synchrotron X-ray data were collected at 160 K to model the experimental electron-density distributions, and derived topological properties from the electron density were used to quantify the weak interactions responsible for the origin of the ferroelectric phase. The structure and non-covalent interactions are analysed using Hirshfeld surfaces and energy frameworks. The topological properties, energies, atomic charges and molecular electrostatic potential surfaces are determined from the experimental data, further supported by theoretical calculations. The results from the ferroelectric phase are compared with the paraelectric phase. Although the structural descriptions indicate neutral phenazine and chloroanilic acid molecules in the ferroelectric phase, the topological properties of the electron density indicate a considerable amount of proton transfer in the O—H...O hydrogen bond. Indeed, the displaced H atom in the O—H...O hydrogen bond suggests a mixed covalent/polar nature of chemical bonding. Subtle changes in the chemical bonding and proton-transfer pathways could be detected from the high-resolution electron-density studies.",

The seven phases investigated correspond to n = 0 (tetradymite), 2 (aleksite-21R and -42R), 4 (saddlebackite-9H and -18H), 6 (unnamed Pb 6 Bi 4 Te 4 S 8 ), 8 (unnamed Pb 8 Bi 4 Te 4 S 10 ), 10 (hitachiite) and 12 (unnamed Pb 12 Bi 4 Te 4 S 14 ). These seven phases correspond to nine single- or double-module structures, each comprising an odd number of atom layers, 5, 7, (5.9), 9, (7.11), 11, 13, 15 and 17, expressed by the formula: S ( M p X p +1 )· L ( M p +1 X p +2 ), where M = Pb, Bi and X = Te, S, p ≥ 2, and S and L = number of short and long modules, respectively. Relaxed structures show a and c values within 1.5% of experimental data; a and the interlayer distance d sub decrease with increasing PbS content. Variable Pb—S bond lengths contrast with constant Pb—S bond lengths in galena. All phases are n -fold superstructures of a rhombohedral subcell with c /3 = d sub *. Electron diffraction patterns show two brightest reflections at the centre of d sub *, described by the modulation vector q F = ( i / N ) · d sub *, i = S + L . A second modulation vector, q = γ · c sub *, shows a decrease in γ, from 1.8 to 1.588, across the n = 0 to n = 12 interval. The linear relationship between γ and d sub allows the prediction of any theoretical phases beyond the studied compositional range. The upper PbS-rich limit of the series is postulated as n = 398 (Pb 398 Bi 4 Te 4 S 400 ), a phase with d sub (1.726 Å) identical to that of trigonal PbS within experimental error. The aleksite series is a prime example of mixed layer compounds built with accretional homology principles.",

    "abstract": "Four new coordination polymers, including 1D, 2D and 3D structures, were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using Cd2+/Zn2+/Cu2+ metal salts as nodes. These polymers were formed through self-assembly of four different dicarboxylic acid ligands, namely adamantane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (H2adc), glutaric acid (H2glu), 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid (H2hip) and fumaric acid (H2fum), in conjunction with the auxiliary ligand [1,4-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)piperazine (bpmp). The corresponding formulae are [Cd3(adc)2(bpmp)Cl2(H2O)2]n (1), {[Cd2(glu)2(bpmp)2(H2O)2]·8H2O·2CH3OH}n (2), [Zn(hip)(bpmp)(H2O)]n (3) and [Cu(fum)(bpmp)(H2O)2]n (4). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the Cd2+ centers in complex 1 all adopt a six-coordinate mode but two distinct {CdO2N2Cl2} and {CuO5Cl} units. The 3D network of complex 1 can be simplified to a binodal (4.6)-connected underlying net with the point symbol (3·42·5·62)4(32·62·72·88·10). Each Cd2+ cation in complex 2 adopts a seven-coordinate {CdO5N2} center, forming an asymmetric pentagonal bipyramidal coordination. Its stacking structure is formed by the interaction of hydrogen bonds between 2D supramolecular layers, with the adjacent layers exhibiting mirror symmetry. Each Zn2+ ion in complex 3 displays a {ZnO3N} four-coordinate unit. Its stacking structure is formed by one-dimensional [Zn(hip)(bpmp)(H2O)]n chains connected through hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, complex 4 features a Jahn-Teller distorted {CuO4N2} octahedral coordination. Subsequently, the thermal stability of these complexes was investigated. The solid-state fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to analyze complexes 1, 2 and 3. Additionally, a Hirshfeld surface analysis was performed on complex 3.",

The structure remains unchanged within the structural type of thortveitite when x = 0.25. In order to establish structural models for performing a Rietveld refinement to the derivative structure, symmetry relations between space groups connecting the basic and derivative structures were used. The higher contrast to X-rays of Fe 3+ , In 3+ and Y 3+ as well as by the behaviour during the refinements of the isotropic thermal displacements, the values of interatomic distances and calculated bond-valence sums for each atom in the asymmetric unit, were helpful for elucidating the relocation of cations in the different available crystallographic sites generated by the symmetry reduction.",

Six- and five-coordinated octahedral models (four planar N with two and one axial CO molecules, respectively) are constructed to simulate the local structures of the Co 2+ centers at different temperatures. Because of the Jahn–Teller effect of the Co 2+ centers, the C 2 –Co–N 4 and C–Co–N 4 combinations undergo different tetragonal elongation distortions along the C 4 axis, characterized by the relative elongation Δ Z and displacement Δ Z ′ of Co 2+ at different temperatures. Given the agreement between the calculated and experimental EPR parameters, as well as the adsorption properties, the six- and five-coordinated models are regarded as suitable for low- and high-temperature systems, respectively. These studies may be helpful to understand the properties of similar MOFs with adsorbed molecules under the effect of ambient temperature.",

This phenomenon is obviously related to the non-ideal behaviour of the crystal. The normal interpretation is disorder in the stacking of weakly interacting 2D layers, known also for a number of other racemates of amino acids with linear hydrophobic side chains, as well as 1:1 complexes between different L- and D-enantiomers (quasi-racemates). Presented here is the first attempt to extract the information hidden in the diffuse scattering for this group of compounds by applying Monte Carlo simulations to the site distributions of two polymorphs in a block of 48 × 48 × 48 unit cells (four sites in each unit cell, 442 368 in total). The results demonstrate that it is indeed possible to model the diffuse scattering and relate it to processes expected to take place during phase transitions, characterized by slipping of molecular bilayers (or parts of them) relative to their neighbours. The understanding of the (intermediate) mixed phases in terms of domain size and defect density is consequently brought to a new level.",

    "abstract": "CsCoO2, featuring a two-dimensional layered architecture of edge- and vertex-linked CoO4 tetrahedra, is subjected to a temperature-driven reversible second-order phase transformation (α → β) at 100 K, which corresponds to a structural relaxation with concurrent tilting and breathing modes of edge-sharing CoO4 tetrahedra. In the present investigation, it was found that pressure induces a phase transition, which encompasses a dramatic change in the connectivity of the tetrahedra. At 923 K and 2 GPa, β-CsCoO2 undergoes a first-order phase transition to a new quenchable high-pressure polymorph, γ-CsCoO2. It is built up of a three-dimensional cristobalite-type network of vertex-sharing CoO4 tetrahedra. According to a Rietveld refinement of high-resolution powder diffraction data, the new high-pressure polymorph γ-CsCoO2 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I41/amd:2 (Z = 4) with the lattice constants a = 5.8711 (1) and c = 8.3214 (2) Å, corresponding to a shrinkage in volume by 5.7% compared with the ambient-temperature and atmospheric pressure β-CsCoO2 polymorph. The pressure-induced transition (β → γ) is reversible; γ-CsCoO2 stays metastable under ambient conditions, but transforms back to the β-CsCoO2 structure upon heating to 573 K. The transformation pathway revealed is remarkable in that it is topotactic, as is demonstrated through a clean displacive transformation track between the two phases that employs the symmetry of their common subgroup Pb21a (alternative setting of space group No. 29 that matches the conventional β-phase cell).",

    "abstract": "Despite the exponential explosion of the number of research papers dealing with organic and metal-organic compounds (e.g.metal-organic frameworks, polymorphism of organic crystals, crystal engineering, etc.), inorganic crystalline materials continue to attract attention from material scientists, crystallographers, condensed matter physicists, solid state chemists and mineralogists.However, there have been very few books published so far in the XXI century that provide an overview of structural correlations existing between various classes of inorganic compounds based upon the analysis of their structural architecture.The book by A ´ngel Vegas is a comprehensive (yet provocative and quite original, see below) treatise on crystal chemistry, where the author unifies a large amount of data to construct a coherent conceptual framework for understanding the large family of inorganic structures usually interpreted through the ionic model.The very basic question the author asks is 'Why do atoms occupy the positions they have in the structures?', which is given as the title of the Chapter 16.Which factors govern the arrangement of ions in ionic crystals?What is the best way to describe the structure of an inorganic crystal so that correlations to related compounds are immediately seen and understood?The subtitle of the book provides a partial answer: 'from the elements to the compounds'.In general, the idea that structures of many inorganic oxides, halogenides and chalcogenides can be described as derivatives of parent metals or intermetallides is not new (and the author provides detailed historical notes here and there).However, Vegas wants to demonstrate how these analogies arise from the nature of interatomic interactions in ionic crystals, gathering evidence from different fields of modern research in condensed matter physics, materials and solid state chemistry.The author develops his approach point-by-point in a manner quite accessible to the reader with a primary knowledge of crystallography and inorganic chemistry.The book contains 18 chapters, which are subdivided into 151 subchapters, each with an average length of three book pages.The first three chapters are devoted to the description of the basic concept of crystal chemistry of the compounds that are usually called 'ionic'.Vegas sharpens his analysis against the 'ionic model' that ' . . .describes the structures as closestpacked arrays of bulky anions with small cations occupying interstices of that anionic array' (p.13).Chapter 4 points out the necessity of alternative approaches, providing some historical examples of structural and geometrical correlations between the cation arrays in the structures of oxides and their parent metals and alloys.This theme is continued in Chapters 6 and 7, where the author comes to the conclusion that 'oxides are real oxygen-stuffed alloys (my italics) whenever we take into account the high-pressures phases ' (p.143).We note the rather strange title for subchapter 7.6 'Cations are not isolated entities . . .', a somewhat incorrect statement, taking into account the range of interactions that cations in oxides are involved in.However, before this conclusion Chapter 5 introduces Zintl phases and the Zintl-Klemm concept with the idea of electron delocalization between metal atoms (e.g. the [Al 2 ] 2À subarray in SrAl 2 ).The author wants us to start to believe that cation-cation interactions in oxides have something in common with metal-metal interactions in Zintl phases.The idea is further promoted in Chapters 8 to 10 that continue to add examples of similarities (or even geometrical identities) of cation arrays in oxides and elemental structures.Therefore, the reader is not surprised",

Under normal conditions the dihydrate easily transforms into the sesquihydrate (ZnAsp 2 ·1.5H 2 O). The dihydrate crystal structure is triclinic, space group P 1 , and the sesquihydrate is monoclinic, space group C 2/ c . However, their structures are closely related and similarly consist of zinc aspartate ribbons parallel to pores accommodating water molecules. These porous structures can breathe water molecules in and out depending on the temperature and air humidity. High pressure above 50 MPa favours the sesquihydrate, as shown by recrystallizations under pressure and compressibility measured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction up to 4 GPa. This preference is explained by the reduced volume of the sesquihydrate and water compressed separately, compared with the dihydrate. The sesquihydrate undergoes an isostructural phase transition when the voids collapse at 0.8 GPa, whereas no phase transitions occur in the dihydrate, because its pores are supported by increased water content.",

(2020) report the chemical design of a metal-organic compound with an outstanding iodine (I 2 ) sorption capability.Sequestration of I 2 , an extremely volatile gas, has important applications in terms of controlling radioactive gases, as various radionuclides of I 2 are released during the fission of nuclear fuels.Thus, the preparation of porous materials that can efficiently capture and store I 2 is of importance not only from an academic point of view, but also for real-life applications.In their report, the authors nicely illustrate the process that has been followed to prepare the final material, demonstrating the importance of careful evaluation of the different crystal structures obtained.In other words, Moghzi and co-workers show an example of the crystal engineering process, i.e. the understanding of intermolecular interactions in the context of crystal packing and the utilization of such understanding in the design of new solids with desired physical and chemical properties.In this sense, they have fine-tuned the synthetic conditions in order to control the dimensionality of the product, from discrete units (0D), to chains (1D) and layers (2D).More specifically, the authors show that the dimensionality of the final coordination polymer is dependent on the coordination mode of the N-heterocyclic polycarboxylic acid used (pyridine-2,6dicarboxylic acid or pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid).This, in turn, depends on the pH of the initial solution, which is varied with the addition of piperazine, a base that also acts a second ligand.These findings, key for the successful chemical design, have been made possible thanks to a detailed analysis of the crystal structures.In order to further expand the dimensionality of the coordination polymers to form a 3D metal-organic framework (or MOF), Moghzi and co-workers replaced the Nheterocyclic polycarboxylic acid for a Zn-based metalloligand, with the aim of connecting the 2D layers in the third direction thus forming a 3D structure.The combination of the metalloligand with a praseodymium salt results in a bimetallic crystalline material which expands in the three dimensions, as was anticipated by the authors.In addition, this structure is thermally stable (up to 400 C), an important aspect for applications.",

    "abstract": "This study uses theoretically methods to investigate, for metal diiodides MI2 (M = Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cd, Pb) with CdI2 (2H polytype) structure, the mutual correlation between the structure-characterizing parameters (the flatness parameter of monolayers f, the Madelung constant A, and bonding angle I-M-I) and correlation of these parameters with contributions of the Coulomb and covalent energies to cohesive energy. The energy contributions to cohesive energy are determined with the use of empirical atomic potentials. It is demonstrated that the parameters f and A, and the bonding angle I-M-I are strictly correlated and increase in the same order: FeI2 < PbI2 < MnI2 < CdI2 < MgI2 < CaI2. It is found that with an increase of parameter A and bonding angle I-M-I the relative contribution of the Coulomb energy to cohesive energy increases, whereas the relative contribution of the covalent energy decreases. For a hypothetical MX2 layered compound with the CdI2 (2H polytype) structure, composed of regular MX6 octahedra (angle X-M-X = 90°), the flatness parameter and the Madelung constant are found to be freg = 2.449 and Areg = 2.183, respectively. Correlation of the covalent energy with the type of distortion of MI6 octahedra (elongation or compression) with respect to regular configuration (angle I-M-I = 90°) is also analyzed.",

Analysis of the difference electron-density maps revealed that the most appropriate model is the twelve-orientation model with the Cs, N, O1 and O2 atoms situated on the Wyckoff positions 1a, 6f, 6f and 24l, respectively, rather than the eight-orientation aragonite model with the Cs, N and O atoms situated on the Wyckoff positions 1a, 8g and 24m, respectively. Both models, however, show close similarities if the large anisotropic displacement parameters of the O atoms in the eight-orientation aragonite model are taken into account.

A structural phase transition is observed at 1.8 GPa and 6.8 GPa in BaCoAs2O7 and BaCoP2O7, respectively. Sharp jumps are observed in their unit-cell volumes and in Raman mode frequencies, thus confirming the first-order nature of their phase transition. These transitions involve the disappearance of the modulation from the ambient-pressure polymorph with clear spectroscopic fingerprints, such as reduction of the number of Raman modes and change of shape on some peaks. The relation between the evolution of the Raman modes along with the structure are presented and supported by density functional theory structural relaxations.",

The monoclinic polymorph crystallized from ethyl acetate is formed due to a large number of very weak C—H...O and C—H...π interactions as well as one strong stacking interaction. The triclinic polymorph crystallized from N , N -dimethylformamide is formed due to a small number of weak specific interactions and a maximal number of strong stacking interactions. The stacked dimer is a complex building unit in both polymorphic structures. Further analysis showed that the monoclinic structure is layered while the triclinic one is columnar. The two polymorphic structures also differ in their biological activity (antidiuretic and analgesic). The monoclinic polymorph possesses very high biological activity while the triclinic polymorph is almost inactive. The polymorphic transition of the biologically active metastable monoclinic structure into the inactive stable triclinic one within four weeks of grinding is caused by orientational factors rather than conformational ones and is accompanied by a change in the redistribution of interaction energies in the crystal from anisotropic to more isotropic. Thus, a slow polymorphic transition after grinding results in a loss of the biological activity.",

    "abstract": "Framboids are microscopic, subspherical aggregates of pyrite microcrystals, where the sulfide is mainly microbiological in origin: a framboid may contain fewer than 100 or more than 500 000 microcrystals.The sizes of the microcrystals span however a much smaller interval.Framboids are ubiquitous but require unique conditions to form.The book by David Rickard, world authority on sulfide chemistry, geochemistry, geomicrobiology, biogeochemistry and ore geology, opens the doors of this fascinating world.The importance of these minuscule aggregates cannot be underestimated, if we consider that pyrite nanoparticles contribute a significant component of the nanoparticulate budget of the oceans [ . . .] and may contribute up to 10% of the dissolved iron emanating from black smoker hydrothermal vents (page 109).The book consists of 13 chapters, preceded by a very useful synopsis (nine pages) presenting the main results in a nutshell, and followed by a list of symbols and abbreviations, a list of units, a glossary (12 pages), a rich bibliography (26 pages) and a detailed index (eight pages).It is a small encyclopedia of all that is known to date about framboids.Chapter 1 (20 pages) is the Introduction which presents the study of framboids, whose principal features are detailed: microscopic size, spheroidal shape, equant and equidimensionality of the microcrystals building up a framboid, their ubiquitous distribution, as well as a short history of their discovery and investigation.Chapter 2 (26 pages) presents the Framboid Sizes, whose distribution is log-normal and varies between less than 2 and more than 200 mm in diameter, although 95% lie between 2.9 and 12.3 mm.As the reliability of the measurement of the size of such small objects is an issue, a detailed discussion describes various errors occurring in the literature in particular the stereological error (error in converting the measure of 2D sections in 3D spheres).Although 99% of framboids are between 2.0 and 17.7 mm in diameter, a statistically significant difference in size is observed between freshwater and marine framboids.Chapter 3 (16 pages) deals with Framboids Shapes.After an introduction on how to evaluate the sphericity and the deviations from it, the effects of gravity are briefly presented, followed by a detailed discussion of the results of these effects, namely the polyhedral morphology which could be revealed only once the microscope technology was sufficiently advanced.Chapter 4 (28 pages) is devoted to Microcrystal Morphology, which is composed, essentially, of modified octahedra and cubes.Because framboid microcrystals seem stable over geologic time periods, no correlation exists between the size of the constituent microcrystal and the geological age of the framboid.After a reminder about the various crystal forms known for pyrite, where the symbol hi is incorrectly used instead of {} for the indices of the forms (Table 4.3; note that the correct symbol is used instead in Table 6.1), we learn that the most common form of pyrite microcrystals in framboids is the octahedron, the least common of the three basic forms (cube, pyritohedron and octahedron), suggesting a peculiar formation mechanism (which is presented in the second part of the book).Detailed analysis shows that the habit is actually that of a truncated octahedron, reflecting a decrease in the degree of supersaturation towards the end of the crystal growth.The association of framboids with organic material is discussed next, showing that the relation is quite complex.The sentence 'the object being observed is two dimensional' (page 73) is imprecise: it is the image of the object that is two dimensional, not the object itself.",

    "abstract": "Contact and multiple cyclic twins of cassiterite commonly form in SnO2-based ceramics when SnO2 is sintered with small additions of cobalt and niobium oxides (dual doping). In this work, it is shown that the formation of twins is a two-stage process that starts with epitaxial growth of SnO2 on CoNb2O6 and Co4Nb2O9 seeds (twin nucleation stage) and continues with the fast growth of (101) twin contacts (twin growth stage). Both secondary phases form below the temperature of enhanced densification and SnO2 grain growth; CoNb2O6 forms at ∼700°C and Co4Nb2O9 at ∼900°C. They are structurally related to the rutile-type cassiterite and can thus trigger oriented (epitaxial) growth (local recrystallization) of SnO2 domains in different orientations on a single seed particle. While oriented growth of cassiterite on columbite-type CoNb2O6 grains can only result in the formation of contact twins, the Co4Nb2O9 grains with a structure comparable with that of corundum represent suitable sites for the nucleation of contact and multiple cyclic twins with coplanar or alternating morphology. The twin nucleation stage is followed by fast densification accompanied by significant SnO2 grain growth above 1300°C. The twin nuclei coarsen to large twinned grains as a result of the preferential and fast growth of the low-energy (101) twin contacts. The solid-state diffusion processes during densification and SnO2 grain growth are controlled by the formation of point defects and result in the dissolution of the twin nuclei and the incorporation of Nb5+ and Co2+ ions into the SnO2 matrix in the form of a solid solution. In this process, the twin nuclei are erased and their role in the formation of twins is shown only by irregular segregation of Co and Nb to the twin boundaries and inside the cassiterite grains, and Co,Nb-enrichment in the cyclic twin cores.",

One-dimensional diffuse scattering of a crystal with particularly strong disorder was modelled with closed-form expressions derived from a growth model. A range of interaction of s = 2 was necessary to satisfactorily describe the observed diffraction intensities. The crystal can be described as a disordered analogue of an allotwin, that is an intergrowth of the Pca 2 1 or Pna 2 1 polytypes with a distinct preference for the former.",

    "abstract": "Various lattice defects in the α I -phase of quinacridone (C 20 H 12 N 2 O 2 ) were simulated using lattice-energy minimizations. α I -Quinacridone forms a chain structure in P 1 , Z = 1. The molecules are connected by hydrogen bonds along [010], by π-stacking along [100] and by weak van der Waals interactions along [001]. α I -Quinacridone is inherently nanocrystalline. Lattice defects were calculated in correspondingly large supercells with up to 4464 atoms, using a previously evaluated force field. Vacancies, vacancy aggregates and interstitial molecules are energetically very unfavourable. A misorientation of a single molecule (flip around [010] by 180°) causes an energy increase of 243.7 kJ mol −1 . Various edge and screw dislocations were investigated. A screw dislocation along [010] causes an energy increase of Δ E = 38.0 kJ mol −1 per molecule, all other line dislocations are even worse. In contrast, the rotation of an entire chain around the chain axis [010] by 180° leads to only a very small energy increase (Δ E = 1.6 kJ mol −1 ) and the real crystals probably contain a high number of such defects. Various planar defects were calculated, including different stacking disorders and misfit-layer structures with two different types of layers having different lateral periodicities. Stacking faults along [001] with herringbone stacking instead of parallel stacking are energetically quite favourable (Δ E = 2.2 kJ mol −1 ); the same is true for domains with misoriented molecules in the [001] direction. As an example for a bulk defect, domains are calculated in which blocks of 4 × 4 chains are rotated by 180° around [010], which leads to an energy increase of only 1.1 kJ mol −1 . Twinning by mirroring at the (001) plane is energetically favourable (Δ E = 0.9 kJ mol −1 ). This twinning was observed in an HRTEM image. It is probable that the crystallites also contain rotations of chains, layers or blocks around [010] by 180°, but these defects cause only a very slight modification of the molecular packing, which was not observable in the HRTEM image. The lattice defects in α I -quinacridone investigated here provide an insight into lattice defects, their energies and local structures. Similar lattice defects are expected to occur also in other similar organic chain structures.",

    "abstract": "The article by Brock (2022) is the result of an ambitious 3+ year long project to study the occurrences of approximate symmetries in the space group P1.Brock selected the November 2019 version of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD; Groom et al., 2016) where 2592 reports of organic crystal structures (based on Z, Z 0 and an R value 0.05) were found.Using a number of criteria this set was distilled down to 1407 Z = Z 0 > 1 and 1049 Z = Z 0 = 1.In the former group, molecules (including cations and anions) within asymmetric units were evaluated for possible approximate symmetries: 2, 2 1 , 3, 3 1 , translations, inversions or glides.Entries in the latter group were retained if some possible approximate symmetry was detected within the molecule(s).A subset of crystal structures was removed from both sets if the symmetry indicated these would be better described in a higher-symmetry space group.Brock's conclusion is that approximate symmetry is pervasive in P1 crystal structures.There are a number of notable findings that are worth considering.About five-sixths of the Z = Z 0 > 1 group and three-quarters of the Z = Z 0 = 1 display evidence of some approximate symmetry.Enantiopure materials mimic inversion symmetry about onethird of the time.Approximate rotational symmetry is found about two-fifths of the time.Perhaps more of a surprise, for achiral and racemic materials, approximate glide or mirror symmetry is found more often than approximate inversion symmetry.Wherever possible Brock points out if the approximate symmetry leads to a better description as a two-dimensional structure with a corresponding layer group designation.For these p2 1 11 and c211 are the most common with p112 as a distant third.In the Results section, the lead observation is that overlooked crystallographic symmetry is common for crystal structures composed of achiral or racemic materials, but is uncommon for enantiopure materials.About 8% of the achiral or racemic structures are better described in a different unit cell or higher-symmetry space group.This is precisely the same conclusion as found by Richard Marsh in the past generation (Marsh, 2009).The statistics presented on recent publications versus the previous decades is not encouraging with the overall trend remaining about the same.Many readers perhaps perused this article when it first appeared, but did not dive into the deposited materials Brock used to determine the results and conclusions.There is a wealth of information within these six files including additional commentary on all crystal structures considered, illustrations of selected structures by approximate symmetry, illustrations of the aforementioned selected structures, a spreadsheet of the P1 Z > 1 structures, a spreadsheet of the P1 Z = 1 structures and a spreadsheet showing cell transformations and calculations of layer offsets.There is an enormous amount of data presented in the files to be gleaned.For example, I found one memorable crystal structure of mine (CSD refcode QUPBIN;Ha & Young, 2009) in the listing, where I learned it had a layer group designation of pba2.It will be interesting to see if this article will inspire better software tools to assist the experimental crystallographer with some additional information when there is approximate symmetry within the crystal structure.When I started my career some 30 years ago it seemed rare in my experience to have any crystal structure with more than one molecule in the asymmetric unit.That observation has changed considerably in recent years.Just this spring and summer I had a period where most of the crystal structures completed in my laboratory had two or more molecules per asymmetric unit, or Z 0 > 1, with several being Z 0 = 8.This phenomenon appears to be due in part to the complexity of",

As commonly observed, the V 10 O 28 6− anion lies on an inversion center. Charge is balanced by two H 2 Met 2+ dications and two monocations, one HGU + and one H 3 O + , substitutionally disordered about another inversion center. The HGU + cation is further positionally disordered by rotation of 26.3 (4)° about an axis approximately along the direction of the three essentially collinear N atoms of the cation, thereby hydrogen bonding to two adjacent rows of cluster O atoms running diagonally across the equatorial plane of the V 10 O 28 6− anion. The highly concerted nature of the HGU + ...cluster interaction in each orientation suggests a synthon that likely preexisted in solution and perhaps, along with heat, contributes to the degradation of the metformin to HGU + . The structure of the salt exhibits a complex charge-stabilized hydrogen-bonded network involving extended C 4 4 (8) chains of the water molecules and the H 2 Met 2+ cations linking the chains into two-dimensional sheets parallel to the bc plane, and V 10 O 28 6− anions linking those sheets into a three-dimensional structure through O w —H...O, N—H...O and C—H...O intermolecular interactions.

The Zr–C system is a typical refractory and hard transition-metal carbide, and its structural integrity and stability under extreme conditions are critical for practical applications. Here, a computational study focusing on the structural stability and crystal evolution pattern of Zr 2 C under ambient and high-pressure conditions was performed using a particle-swarm optimization algorithm, in combination with first-principles calculations. The calculations identified seven viable stable or metastable crystalline phases of Zr 2 C, exhibiting Fd 3 m , R 3 m , Cmcm , Cmca , Pbcn , Pnma and I 4/ mcm symmetries; further, a series of structural phase transitions were determined as the pressure increased: Fd 3 m → R 3 m → Cmcm → Cmca . In addition, the mechanical and dynamical stabilities of these phases were verified, and their structural properties were investigated. Overall, this work reveals valuable information concerning the structural, mechanical and electronic properties of Zr 2 C, providing key insights into the mechanisms underlying its crystal evolution behavior.",

Aside from the known tetragonal–orthorhombic (240 K) and orthorhombic–monoclinic (69 K) phase transitions, in the 130 &lt; T ≤ 295 K range the overall structure can be viewed as a host–guest (H–G) composite. The BaS 3 matrix is the host, while the V-chains form the guest. The two subsystems lock in at T LOCK = 130 ± 20 K. This temperature is marked by a symmetry change from orthorhombic to monoclinic. This results in the formation of twins, implying a structural phase transition identified here for the first time. From the refined structural data, it is possible to follow, starting already at 295 K downwards, the stepwise transformation of VS 6 octahedra into VS 5 tetragonal pyramids as the origin of the structure evolution. The new findings will yield a better understanding of the complex electronic phase diagram of BaVS 3 .",

Na 6 [Al 3 P 5 O 20 ], with a strongly pseudo-orthorhombic lattice, is described by the monoclinic crystal structure established in the study of a pseudomerohedric microtwin. The design of Na 6 [Al 3 P 5 O 20 ] can be interpreted as an alternative to sodalite, with a monoclinic (pseudo-orthorhombic) 2×4×1 super-structure and unit-cell parameters multiples of those of sodalite: a ≃ 2 a s , b ≃ 4 b s and c ≃ c s . The triperiodic framework is built by AlO 6 , AlO 4 and PO 4 polyhedra having vertex-bridging contacts. While all the oxygen vertices of the Al-centred octahedra and tetrahedra are shared with phosphate groups, some of the PO 4 tetrahedra remain `pendant', e.g. containing vertices not shared with other polyhedra of the aluminophosphate construction. Na atoms occupy framework channels and cavities surrounded by eight-, six- and four-membered windows with maximal effective pore widths of 4.86 × 3.24 and 4.31 × 3.18 Å. The generalized framework density is equal to 19.8, which means that the compound may be classified as a microporous zeolite. The Na 6 [Al 3 P 5 O 20 ] crystal structure is discussed as being formed from octahedral rods arranged in two perpendicular directions, similar to the rods elongated in one direction in the NASICON-type compounds, which have been intensively investigated as promising materials for batteries. Analogous properties can be expected for phases with a modified composition of the Na 6 Al 3 P 5 O 20 topology, where the Al atoms at the centres of octahedra are replaced by Fe, V or Cr.",

Upon subsequent cooling, two structural phase transitions at about 323 and 319 K are observed, where the crystal adopts orthorhombic symmetry.

X-ray photoelectron studies with a combination of magnetic measurements demonstrate that Cr adopts the 3+ oxidation state. Based on the Curie–Weiss analysis of magnetic susceptibility data, the Néel temperature is found to be around 2.2 K and the effective moment (μ eff ) of Cr 3+ in [CrBr 2 (NCCH 3 ) 4 ](Br 3 ) is ∼3.8 µ B , which agrees with the theoretical value for Cr 3+ . The direct current magnetic susceptibility of the molecule shows a broad maximum at ∼2.3 K, which is consistent with the theoretical Néel temperature. The maximum temperature, however, shows no clear frequency dependence. Combined with the observed upturn in heat capacity below 2.3 K and the corresponding field dependence, it is speculated that the low-temperature magnetic feature of a broad transition in [CrBr 2 (NCCH 3 ) 4 ](Br 3 ) could originate from a crossover from high spin to low spin for the split d orbital level low-lying states rather than a short-range ordering solely; this is also supported by the molecular orbital diagram obtained from theoretical calculations.",

The compounds crystallize in a tetragonal crystal structure of the Mo 2 FeB 2 type (space group P 4/ mbm ). At low temperatures, the magnetic moments, localized solely on the rare earth atoms, form antiferromagnetic structures described by the propagation vector k = [ k x , k x , ½], with k x equal to ¼ for R = Er and Tm or 0.3074 (4) for R = Ho. The magnetic moments are parallel to the c axis for R = Ho or lie within the (001) plane for R = Er and Tm. The obtained magnetic structures are discussed on the basis of symmetry analysis. The rare earth magnetic moments, determined from neutron diffraction data collected at 1.6 K, are 6.5 (1) μ B (Er) and 6.09 (4) μ B (Tm), while in the incommensurate modulated magnetic structure in Ho 2 Ni 1.78 In the amplitude of modulation of the Ho magnetic moment is 7.93 (8) μ B .

The reduction of rare earth magnetic moments in the ordered state in R 2 Ni 1.78 In ( R = Tb, Ho, Er and Tm) and the change in direction of the moments indicate the influence of the crystalline electric field (CEF) on the stability of the magnetic order in the investigated compounds.",

    "abstract": "In the past few issues of Acta Crystallographica Section B, including the current one, several articles have reported research work on quantum crystallography.Collectively they comprise a virtual special issue on the subject, the first on such an extended concept in the IUCr journals.Previously, a special issue, dedicated to Philip Coppens (1930Coppens ( -2017)), was published in Acta Crystallographica Section B (August 2017).It contained many contributions in the field of charge density (as well as photo-crystallography).Originally intended to celebrate his retirement with contributions on two of the main topics developed during his career, the issue appeared just a few weeks after Professor Coppens passed away and became a kind of memorial issue.The occasion of the present special issue is the principal authors' participation in the first online quantum crystallography meeting (QCrOM2020) held in August 2020.It was organized (and mostly improvised) to replace the sessions on this subject initially programmed for the IUCr Congress in Prague, which, as we know, was postponed to 2021.Its virtual modality (and its subsequent free of charge registration) made it possible to attract attendees from a wider range of expertise.It was the opportunity to present the latest results and reviews on the field and share opinions during fruitful discussion sessions that normally do not take place at large scale and tightly scheduled meetings like those of the IUCr Congress.Despite all the difficulties caused by the pandemic the field is currently blooming, and the community is undergoing a generational turnover with many new young researchers involved and new groups established.The field's momentum is testified by the rather broad spectrum of studies published in this special issue, with a variety of research themes and many topics analyzed or reviewed in detail.Quantum crystallography is a modern name for a field that started when quantum mechanics itself was put forward, coinciding with the early days of X-ray crystallography.In keeping with Peter Debye's early intuition (Debye, 1915), the discovery of X-ray diffraction offered a whole new possibility 'to establish by experiment the particular arrangement of the electrons in the atoms'.Many studies became possible thanks to the interplay between crystallographic techniques and quantum physics.For example, experimental crystallography was used to unveil the nature of electrons (waves and corpuscles; see De Broglie, 1929), to investigate the electronic structures of metals (Weiss & Demarco, 1958), to map the charge density around atoms to form bonds and molecules or solids (Coppens, 1967), and the electron polarization upon application of external stimuli (such as the electric field, see Hansen et al., 2004) or upon temperature changes.Quite remarkably, these kinds of studies are those that originally attracted the interest of quantum physicists for the emerging field of X-ray crystallography in the 1920s.At the same time, chemists also envisaged the exceptional outcome from crystallographic studies and the vast array of details useful in developing theories of chemical bonding (Pauling, 1939).This sentiment has always accompanied studies on accurate charge density, which has become the favourite observable for revealing the nature of chemical bonding and the supramolecular interactions, especially -but not only -within the paradigm of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (Bader, 1990) that becomes, in the crystallographic framework, the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals (Gatti, 2005).",

    "abstract": "High-resolution X-ray diffraction experiments, theoretical calculations and atom-specific X-ray absorption experiments were used to investigate two nickel complexes, (MePh 3 P) 2 [Ni II (bdtCl 2 ) 2 ]·2(CH 3 ) 2 SO [complex (1)] and (MePh 3 P)[Ni III (bdtCl 2 ) 2 ] [complex (2)]. Combining the techniques of nickel K - and sulfur K -edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy with high-resolution X-ray charge density modeling, together with theoretical calculations, the actual oxidation states of the central Ni atoms in these two complexes are investigated. Ni ions in two complexes are clearly in different oxidation states: the Ni ion of complex (1) is formally Ni II ; that of complex (2) should be formally Ni III , yet it is best described as a combination of Ni 2+ and Ni 3+ , due to the involvement of the non-innocent ligand in the Ni— L bond. A detailed description of Ni—S bond character (σ,π) is presented.",
