    "abstract": "Abstract Professor Pavel Štys (1933–2018) was an eminent specialist in morphology, taxonomy, systematics, biology and behaviour of Heteroptera, and the Commissioner of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. All his career was connected with the Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, where he educated several generations of Czech biologists and teachers. Here we provide his short biography, personal memories of his colleagues, bibliography currently comprising 386 papers, and annotated list of the taxa he described, which includes two families (Stemmocryptidae and Medocostidae), 11 subfamilies, 4 tribes, 54 genus-group and 129 species-group names, all of them in Heteroptera, except one species and one subspecies of Syrphidae (Diptera). Within the list the grammatical gender of the genera Chauliops Scott, 1874 and Neochauliops Štys, 1963 is corrected to masculine in accordance with ICZN (1999: Article 30.1.4.3) affecting the gender agreement in the following species: Chauliops conicus Gao &amp; Bu, 2009, Ch. lobatulus Breddin, 1907, Ch. petiolatus (Germar, 1837), Ch. quaternarius Gao &amp; Bu, 2009, and Neochauliops laciniatus (Bergroth, 1916).",

    "abstract": "The family Anthomyzidae (Diptera: Acalyptrata) is recorded from China for the first time based on 11 species, 6 of them new to science. A distinctive new genus Marshallya gen. nov. is described, based on single peculiar species, M. platythorax sp. nov. (both sexes) from Sichuan. Other new species, viz. Amygdalops sevciki sp. nov. (Hainan I.) (both sexes), Epischnomyia tkoci sp. nov. (Sichuan) (male only), Anthomyza ornata sp. nov. (Sichuan) (female only), Anthomyza sulphurea sp. nov. (Yunnan) (both sexes) and Arganthomyza hyperseta sp. nov. (Shaanxi) (male only) are described and illustrated in detail. Male-female association of two Amygdalops species is clarified by means of molecular barcoding and the female of A. bisinus Roháček, 2008 is correctly identifi ed and described. Relationships of all these taxa are discussed. Five species, viz. Amygdalops bisinus (Hainan I.), Epischnomyia merzi Roháček, 2009, Anthomyza cuneata Roháček, 1987, Anthomyza trifurca Sueyoshi &amp; Roháček, 2003 (all from Sichuan) and Arganthomyza versitheca Roháček, 2009 (Shaanxi, Sichuan) are new additions to the Chinese fauna of Anthomyzidae. DNA sequences of the barcoding region of COI have been obtained for 3 species, Amygdalops bisinus, Amygdalops sevciki and Marshallya platythorax. Biology and distribution of all 11 species are discussed. First photographs of living Anthomyzidae from East Asia are presented. Based on knowledge of Anthomyzidae from neighbouring areas the diversity of the Chinese fauna of the family is estimated to include 50-60 species.",

Chaetarthria is considered to consist of three groups differing in the morphology of male genitalia and surrounding sclerites: (1) large Old World Chaetarthria which seems to stand apart of the remaining groups, and (2) European Chaetarthria plus (3) American Chaetarthria which both share the male sternite 8 with a long median projection with Thysanarthria . The reduced mesal part of male sternite 9 is shared by European Chaetarthria and Thysanarthria , supporting their close relationship proposed by previous molecular analyses. Sixteen species are recognized within Thysanarthria which differ in the details of the morphology of the aedeagus illustrated for all species. Seven species are described as new: T. bifida sp. nov. (Thailand), T. cardamona sp. nov. (India: Kerala), T. chui sp. nov. (Taiwan), T. persica sp. nov. (southern Iran), T. saurahana sp. nov. (Nepal), T. trifida (Laos), and T. wadicola sp. nov. (Oman).

The unexpected first record of Helotrephes from India expands their distribution more than 1,000 kilometres westward. The new species belongs to the H. australis species-group which is widespread in southern China and Southeast Asia. Helotrephes nainamalaii sp. nov. can be identified by the presence of a sub-basal protrusion on the genal plate, a characteristic apical hook on the aedeagus, and peculiarly shaped ventromedian carinae. The description is supplemented by a key to the species of the Helotrephes australis species-group. Tiphotrephes indicus (Distant, 1910) is recorded from Meghalaya for the first time. A check-list of Helotrephidae in India is given.",

Luperomorphella Chûjô, 1964 is removed from the synonymy with Taumacera and proposed as a new synonym of Cerophysa Chevrolat, 1836. As a result of the examination of extensive type material, the following new combinations are proposed: Cerophysaalbomaculata (Chûjô, 1964) comb. nov.

(from Auchenia ). New substitute names are proposed for preoccupied taxa which are newly transferred to Taumacera from other genera: Taumacera kimotoi nom. nov. (for Acroxena femoralis Kimoto, 1989, nec Platyxantha femoralis Allard, 1889, synonym of T. fulvicollis (Jacoby, 1881)); Taumacera indicola nom. nov. (for Acroxena indica Jacoby, 1896, nec Taumacera indica (Jacoby, 1889)); Taumacera medvedevi nom. nov. (for Acroxena nigricornis Medvedev, 1992, nec Taumacera nigricornis (Baly, 1864)). The following new synonyms are established: Fleutiauxia chinensis (Maulik, 1933) = Fleutiauxia mutifrons Gressitt &amp; Kimoto, 1963 syn. nov.; Hoplosaenidea abdominalis (Jacoby, 1884) = Platyxantha wallacei Jacoby, 1895 syn. nov.; Metrioidea grandis (Allard, 1889) = Platyxantha robusta Jacoby, 1895 syn. nov.; Taumacera lewisi (Jacoby, 1887) = Aenidea hirtipennis Jacoby, 1887 syn. nov.; Taumacera indica (Jacoby, 1889) = Palpoxena yunnana Medvedev, 2015 syn. nov.; Taumacera sumatrensis (Jacoby, 1884) = Ozomena intermedia Jacoby, 1899 syn. nov. Platyxantha quadraticollis Jacoby, 1896 is confirmed as a synonym of Theopella bodjoensis (Duvivier, 1885). The name Hyphaenia tibialis Medvedev &amp; Romantsov, 2013 is fixed by the act of the first reviewer principle. Based on the structure of antennae, seven species-groups are recognized (the antennata -group, the cervicornis -group, the deusta -group, the insignis -group, the nasuta -group, the nigricornis -group, and the viridis -group). Lectotypes are designated for Platyxantha balyi Jacoby, 1895 and Dorydea indica Jacoby, 1889, which is important since each of their syntype series consists of two different species",

    "abstract": "Oxyporinae are a visually attractive and highly specialized mycophagous subfamily of rove beetles (Staphylinidae) with enigmatic origins and a largely unknown evolutionary history. Our knowledge of their immature stages and biology, valuable for solving questions about their phylogeny, is still very fragmentary. Here, we describe for the first time the larval morphology of Oxyporus (s. str.) procerus Kraatz, 1879 and O. (Pseudoxyporus) melanocephalus Kirschenblatt, 1938, both from the Russian Far East. We redescribe the larval morphology of the widespread O. (s. str.) maxillosus Fabricius, 1775 based on material, also from the Russian Far East. All larvae are identified based on the combined evidence from rearing and cox1 barcoding. For O. maxillosus, O. procerus and O. (P.) melanocephalus we provide some new field and laboratory-based data on feeding, mating, oviposition, female brood care, duration of larval development, and behavior. We applied the Atheta-based system of Ashe &amp; Watrous (1984) to describe and compare the chaetotaxy of these Oxyporus larvae. We extract the most essential comparable data for all species of Oxyporus with known larvae from poorly compatible published larval descriptions with dubious homology assessments for their chaetotaxy. In addition, data on fungal hosts and beetle biology is summarized for the genus and provided for each species. New morphological traits are revealed for the Oxyporus larvae. Significant differences in larval morphology, reproduction behavior and cox1 barcoding region between the subgenera Oxyporus s. str. and Pseudoxyporus Nakane &amp; Sawada, 1956 correspond to the morphological distance between their adults and suggest that they may be potentially elevated to genus rank.",

The single specimen that was found is most likely the result of unintentional release. Successful spreading of H. axyridis in Saudi Arabia will be limited because of high temperatures during summer and scarcity of prey (aphids). New records from Iran and Turkey suggest fast spreading of H. axyridis in these parts of the Middle East. In addition, we also present new records from Iran and Turkey for H. quadripunctata (Pontoppidan, 1763), the other species in the genus that occurs in the Middle East region.

Males of the two species and the queen of A. fiorii were never described. The scarcity of information contained in the original description led to several misunderstandings by subsequent authors: for example, A. sicula was later elevated to species-rank on the basis of misidentified material of A. fiorii stat. nov. We redescribe the two species, adding the descriptions of their missing castes and designating their lectotypes. We also describe a third related species of the genus: A. trinacriae sp. nov. from Sicily. The ecology and distribution of the three are illustrated. Their relationship with the other congeneric species of the Mediterranean basin is discussed considering the morphology of all three castes, with attention to the often-overlooked males. Despite the fact that A. fiorii and A. sicula were lately believed to be close relatives of A. subterranea (Latreille, 1798), the morphological elements available suggest that they probably belong to a separate, hitherto unrecognized clade from the Maghreb (North-Western Africa), together with A. trinacriae sp. nov.",

Habitus of males and females and male genitalia of both species and female genitalia of A. oenderi sp. nov. are illustrated. Additionally, 10 Heteroptera species are recorded from Turkey for the first time: Campylomma miyamotoi Yasunaga, 2001, Compsidolon ( Compsidolon ) elegantulum Reuter, 1899, Hallodapus concolor (Reuter, 1890), Maurodactylus kukuensis V.

In this part of the catalogue dealing with the Staphylinini subtribe Philonthina (Staphylinidae: Staphylininae) we present information on types of 278 species level taxa. Except for the general collection, the type material comes mostly from the recently acquired collection of the late Lubomír Hromádka. A new substitute name, Philonthus acervulus nom. nov., is proposed for Philonthus zosterops Hromádka, 2013, a junior primary homonym of Philonthus zosterops Hromádka, 2011. One new combination is established: Eccoptolonthus terezae (Hromádka, 2016) comb. nov. from Pseudohesperus Hayashi, 2008. Philonthus zosterops Hromádka, 2011 is synonymized with P. mesophoyx Hromádka, 2016, syn. nov. Correct original spellings of Philonthus terathopius Hromádka, 2012 and Philonthus crecopsis Hromádka, 2013 are fixed. The type locality and distribution of Philonthus camelus Hromádka, 2008 is corrected from Tanzania: Kilimandjaro to the Republic of the Congo: Bouansa.",

The publication date of that paper is fixed as March 20, 1893, affecting these taxa: Reduviidae: Coranopsis Horváth, 1893, Coranopsis vittata Horváth, 1893, Cosmolestes fulvus Horváth, 1893, Edocla albipennis Horváth, 1893, Harpactor (Diphymus) dudae Horváth, 1893, Oncocephalus angustatus Horváth, 1893, Phonoctonus validus Horváth, 1893, Reduvius reuteri Horváth, 1893, Staccia inermis Horváth, 1893; Blissidae: Ischnocoridea Horváth, 1893, Ischnocoridea elegans Horváth, 1893; Rhyparochromidae: Aphanus (Graptopeltus) dilutus Horváth, 1893 [= Naphiellus dilutus (Horváth, 1893)], Pamera bergrothi Horváth, 1893 [= Horridipamera bergrothi (Horváth, 1893)]; Coreidae: Homoeocerus fuscicornis Horváth, 1893, Hypselonotus balteatus Horváth, 1893 [= Hypselonotus interruptus Hahn, 1833]; Plataspidae: Niamia Horváth, 1893, Niamia angulosa Horváth, 1893; Scutelleridae: Cantao africanus Horváth, 1893, Cryptacrus princeps Horváth, 1893 [= Cryptacrus comes comes (Fabricius, 1803)], Polytodes Horváth, 1893 [= Polytes Stål, 1867], Polytodes ochraceus Horváth, 1893 [= Polytes tigrinus (Vollenhoven, 1868)]; Dinidoridae: Dinidor vicarius Horváth, 1893; Pentatomidae: Caura modesta Horváth, 1893, Diploxys (Paracoponia) holubi Horváth, 1893 [= Coponia holubi (Horváth, 1893)], Paracoponia Horváth, 1893 [= Coponia Stål, 1865], Mecosoma spinosum Horváth, 1893 [= Macrorhaphis acuta Dallas, 1851], Menida distanti Horváth, 1893 [= Menida transversa transversa (Signoret, 1861)], and Stollia crucifera Horváth, 1893. Only the following type specimens bearing Horváth’s original type label and deposited in HNHM are recognized and their status elucidated: Coranopsis vittata (1 syntype), Cosmolestes fulvus (holotype), Edocla albipennis (holotype), Harpactor (Diphymus) dudae (1 syntype), Oncocephalus angustatus (1 syntype), Reduvius reuteri (1 syntype), Homoeocerus fuscicornis (1 syntype), Hypselonotus balteatus (1 syntype), Niamia angulosa (1 syntype), Cryptacrus princeps (1 syntype), Polytodes ochraceus (holotype), Dinidor vicarius (holotype), Caura modesta (lectotype), Diploxys (Paracoponia) holubi (lectotype), and Menida distanti (1 syntype). The syntype(s) of Cantao africanus and holotype of Stollia crucifera could not be located; a specimen in NMPC presumably from the same series is designated here as neotype of Stollia crucifera.

Rhynocoris katangensis Schouteden, 1929 (Reduviidae), erroneously considered as junior synonym of Rhynocoris dudae by MALDONADO CAPRILES (1990), must be considered valid species.

The recent dis- covery of Cretogerris albianus Perrichot, Nel & Neraudeau, 2005 from the Lower Cretaceous shows that all families were present in the Mesozoic, and phylogenetic and biogeographic evidence suggest that most - perhaps all - extant subfamilies were also present at that time. By comparison, the fossil record of the families Hydrometridae and Gerridae is far richer than that of any other family, which allows a more detailed interpretation of the phylogenetic relationships among extinct and extant taxa of these two groups.",

The new species is similar to Airaphilus filiformis (Rosenhauer, 1856), however it can be distinguished by long antennae reaching about body midlength; anterior margin of pronotum about as wide as head; elytra without a humeral tooth, rounded to base and more to apices; and long metaventrite. Only five specimens have been found and these were collected in 1992 at Kokeyachi bog in the far north of Honshu. This bog and the adjacent wetlands have begun to dry out and are undergoing a transition to grassland. These factors, together with the apparently very limited distribution and the possibly restricted mobility due to lack of hind wings, suggest that at least in this locality the new species may be endangered.",

    "abstract": "The morphology and taxonomy of the genus Pseudorygmodus Hansen, 1999 endemic to Chile is reviewed based on freshly collected material and museum specimens. Two species are recognized: P. flintispangleri (Moroni, 1985) widespread from Los Lagos Region to Magallanes Region, and P. versicolor sp. nov. which is only known from Parque Nacional Nahuelbuta in La Araucania Region. A phylogenetic analysis is performed to reveal the position of the genus within Hydrophilidae, based on four genes (cox1, cox2, 18S and 28S). The results reveal that Pseudorygmodus is a member of the tribe Anacaenini of the subfamily Chaetarthriinae, which is supported by both adult and larval morphology. Within Anacaenini, it was placed in the Anacaena Thomson, 1859 clade, which is supported by the morphology of the nasale of the larva. The phylogenetic analysis performed here as well as the morphological comparison of larvae of the Anacaenini brought additional evidence supporting the internal topology of the tribe, including the polyphyly of Anacaena in the current sense. The genus Crenitulus Winters, 1926, stat. restit., is hence reestablished for the former Anacaena suturalis group, containing the following species: C. attiguus (Orchymont, 1942) comb. nov., C. hirsutus (Komarek, 2005) comb. nov., C. nitens (Gentili, 1993) comb. nov., C. paleodominicus (Fikacek & Engel, 2011) comb. nov., C. perpennus (Orchymont, 1942) comb. nov., C. solstitialis (Kirsch, 1873) comb. nov., C. schoedli (Komarek, 2005) comb. nov., and C. suturalis (LeConte, 1866). The genus Gentilina Hebauer, 2003, syn. nov., is synonymized with Crenitulus. A potential distribution is modelled for five hydrophilid genera endemic to southern South America (Andotypus Spangler, 1979, Anticura Spangler, 1979, Cylorygmus Orchymont, 1933, Hydramara Knisch, 1925 and Pseudorygmodus) using the high-resolution climatic data and the maximum entropy approach, in order to focus the future collecting effort to the areas where the genera likely occur. Biology and distribution of Pseudorygmodus and other endemic austral genera is briefly discussed, as well as problems that should be focused in future phylogenetic studies of the Chaetarthriinae and Anacaenini.",

The biology of the species was studied in Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. Common Stork’s-bill (Erodium cicutarium) (Geraniaceae) is identified as a host plant of both larvae and adults of this weevil. The weevil is very likely monophagous, and previous records of thyme (Thymus sp., Lamiaceae) as the host plant hence appear incorrect. Coniocleonus nigrosuturatus prefers dry, sunny places in grassland habitats, with sparse vegetation, bare ground and patchily growing host plants. Overwintering beetles emerge in early spring (March), feed and mate on the host plants. The highest activity of adults was observed from mid-April to mid-May. Larvae live in the soil in a vertical tunnel near the host plant and feed externally on the base of the stem. Usually, a single larva was observed at an attacked plant, however, sometimes up to 3 larvae were found. At the beginning of July, the larvae pupate in a closed earthen cell. A reared adult emerged in the laboratory at the end of July. We suppose that part of the population overwinters in pupation cells, although some adults leave the cells at the end of summer. They then most likely spend some time feeding on the host plants and look for suitable shelters in which to overwinter later.",

New records of 48 species are presented, while two previously described species, Dineutus arabicus Regimbart, 1907 and Hydaticus arabicus Guignot, 1951, are diagnosed and illustrated. Four species of Dytiscidae are recorded from Oman for the first time; twelve species (one Gyrinidae, 11 Dytiscidae) are recorded from Yemen for the first time – eight from continental Yemen and four from Socotra; in addition two other Dytiscidae species are recorded from Socotra for the first time, and the occurrence of another Gyrinidae species previously known from a doubtful record is confirmed. Habitat information is provided for recently collected species. The zoogeographical patterns of the region are briefly summarized.",

    "abstract": "Epimetopidae are a small beetle family of the superfamily Hydrophiloidea, comprising 72 described species in three genera: the American Epimetopus Lacordaire, 1854 (56 species), Asian Eumetopus Balfour-Browne, 1949 (eight species) and African Eupotemus Ji &amp; Jäch, 1998 (eight species, of which six are described as new here). In this study we illustrate and compare the adult morphology of all three genera and generate the first DNA sequences for Eumetopus and Eupotemus. The morphological data and sequences of four genes (cox1, 16S, 18S and 28S) are used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among genera. Both strongly support the monophyly of Epimetopidae, reveal Eumetopus as the earliest diverging taxon and Epimetopus + Eupotemus as a strongly supported clade with numerous synapomorphies. The reciprocal monophyly of Epimetopus and Eupotemus is strongly supported by DNA data but not in the morphological analysis which reveals Epimetopus paraphyletic. Eumetopus, despite being the earliest branching clade, is characterized by many unique derived structures, e.g. by the presence of the sperm pump in males (unique in Hydrophiloidea). The available data on the biology of Epimetopidae indicate that most species inhabit sandy to muddy margins of streams or rivers. Females of all three genera carry egg cases; Epimetopidae hence are one of three independent lineages of Hydrophiloidea in which this behavior evolved. Larvae are only known for Epimetopus and are characterized by morphological adaptations for feeding by piercing and sucking, a closed tracheal system and abdominal gills; larvae of Eumetopus and Eupotemus remain unknown and further research is needed to confirm whether they show the same adaptations as Epimetopus. The taxonomy of the African genus Eupotemus is re­vised, with six species described as new: E. bilobatus sp. nov. (Nigeria), E. cameroonensis sp. nov. (Cameroon), E. ophioglossus sp. nov. (Gabon, Togo), E. smithi sp. nov. (Côte d’Ivoire), E. taianus sp. nov. (Côte d’Ivoire) and E. uluguru sp. nov. (Tanzania). Eupotemus limicola Delève, 1967 is fixed as the type species of the genus according to ICZN (1999: Art. 70.3). New records of Eumetopus species are provided (E. acutimontis Ji &amp; Jäch, 1998 from Vietnam, E. bullatus (Sharp, 1875) from India: Maharashtra, E. flavidulus (Sharp, 1890) from India: Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, E. maindroni (Régimbart, 1903) from India: Maharashtra and Gujarat, and E. weigeli Skale &amp; Jäch, 2003 from India: Uttarakhand). The habitus of all species is illustrated. An updated checklist of the Epimetopus species is provided, and records of two specimens of the E. costatus group from Zambia and Saudi Arabia are considered to result from either accidental introductions or mislabelling.",

This species is found to not be congeneric with the rest of Tolumnia Stål, 1868, including the type species. This verifies the original opinion of Breddin (1909), which was subsequently rejected by Distant (1918) but without argumentation. As a result, the monotypic genus Mormoschema Breddin, 1909, stat. restit., is removed from synonymy with Tolumnia, and the combination Mormoschema immaculatum (Distant, 1900) is restituted. The male and female genitalia of Mormoschema immaculatum are described in detail. The tribal placement of Mormoschema is discussed; the genus is excluded from Cappaeini and transferred to Eysarcorini. Buddleja asiatica and Scrophularia sp.

The majority of the name-bearing types of the group were revised. The neotype for P. tridens is suggested herein. The following junior subjective synonymies are recognized: P. frankenbergeri Balthasar, 1939 = P. tridens Castelnau, 1840, P. tricornis Olsoufieff, 1924 = P. herbeus Bates, 1887, and P. babori Balthasar, 1939 = P. nimrod Harold, 1863; while P. furcosus Felsche, 1901 = P. furiosus Bates, 1887 is recognized as a junior objective synonymy. The species within the P. tridens species group are diagnosed by the morphology of the pronotum and elytra, while the genital morphology of males is found to be homogeneous and uninformative for species delimitation. Most species within the group show a wide diversity of colouration (showing green, red, and blue chromatic phases). This probably led to taxonomical confusion by previous authors. Here, we present a new identification key, species distribution models. Habitus photographs and character illustrations for all the species within the group are provided. The climatic niches overlap widely in P. herbeus and P. daphnis, but the other species within the group show a reduced overlap in their climatic niches. Consequently, the P. tridens species group is proposed as a case of morphological stasis that might be explained by a trade-off between the evolution of pronotal structures and genitalia, while differences in the ecological niche might promote speciation.",

Type specimens of Cicindela morio Klug, 1834, Cicindela denticulata Klug, 1834, Cicindela acompsa Chaudoir, 1852, Cicindela egena Chaudoir, 1854, Cicindosa inaequalis Motschulsky, 1864 and Cicindosa obliquealba Motschulsky, 1864 were examined; types of Cicindela ocskayi Gistl, 1837 are unknown. These aligned taxa were inconsistently treated in literature either as infrasubspecific or infraspecific taxa of Cicindela morio, or recently as junior synonyms of Cylindera (Cylindera) morio. As a result of the present revision of the species-complex, Cicindela acompsa and C. denticulata proved to be separate species. The former is treated here as Cylindera (Cylindera) acompsa (Chaudoir, 1852), comb. nov. Because Cicindela denticulata Klug, 1834 proved to be a primary junior homonym of Cicindela denticulata T. W. Harris, 1828, it must be replaced by its next oldest synonym, Cicindela ocskayi Gistl, 1837. Lectotypes of the relevant taxa are designated, with the lectotype of Cicindela denticulata Klug, 1834 simultaneously designated as the neotype of Cicindela ocskayi Gistl, 1837, which makes these names objective synonyms; consequently, the taxon is treated here as Cylindera (Cylindera) ocskayi (Gistl, 1837) comb. nov. Cicindela egena is confirmed here as a junior synonym of Cylindera (Cylindera) morio, while Cicindosa inaequalis is a junior synonym of Cylindera (Cylindera) acompsa. Cylindera (Cylindera) amayai sp. nov. is described as new for science from Bolivia. Cicindosa obliquealba is provisionally treated here as Cylindera (Cylindera) obliquealba (Motschulsky, 1864) comb. nov., as its synonymy with Cylindera (Cylindera) acompsa could not be proved. Due to the absence of specimens with preserved DNA, the revision could not be supported by molecular research within these generally very rare taxa. Habitus and diagnostic characters of all the type and other examined specimens are illustrated here in colour photographs for the first time.

Paprika gen. nov. exhibits a unique combination of the characters in wing venation that distinguish it from both extant and extinct Ameletopsidae. Although the new genus is assigned to Ameletopsidae based on imaginal morphological characters, it cannot be placed within the existing subfamilies due to the absence of male or caudal appendage characters. This discovery represents the oldest imaginal Ameletopsidae fossil discovered so far and provides the first fossil record of the family in Asia. The finding supports a broader, possibly Pangean, distribution and origin of Ameletopsidae during the Mesozoic and contributes to the understanding of the evolutionary history and paleobiogeography of Siphlonuroidea.

    "abstract": "Abstract Hyocephalidae (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Pentatomomorpha) is a small family of true bugs containing two genera and three species endemic to Australia. For the first time, we examine here selected structures of their external morphology using scanning electron microscopy – the external structures associated with the metathoracic and dorsoabdominal scent glands, the strainer organ on the sternite III, as well as the trichobothrial pattern and ultrastructure. The following character states are confirmed (i, ii, iii) or newly recognised (iv, v) as autapomorphies of Hyocephalidae: i) apically projected scimitar-shaped peritreme of the metathoracic scent glands; ii) presence of a strainer organ on sternite III in both sexes; iii) trichobothria on sternite V placed immediately ventrad of spiracle, iv) trichobothria on each of abdominal segments III–VII all grouped together within a common trichome, and v) presence of crocus-like structures within the trichome. Of particular interest is the presence of a shallow open bothrium (type B) surrounded by a trichome in Hyocephalidae, a probably derived character state shared with Pyrrhocoroidea and most Lygaeoidea, while Stenocephalidae (previously considered to be closely related to Hyocephalidae and used here for comparison) and the remaining Coreoidea possess a recessed bothrium of type A2, lacking the trichome. The morphology of trichobothria in Hyocephalidae may thus suggest either their closer relationship to Lygaeoidea + Pyrrhocoroidea than to Coreoidea, or a parallel evolution of the open bothrium with trichome in Eutrichophora. We highlight the importance of Hyocephalidae for a better understanding of the phylogeny of Eutrichophora and the urgent need to obtain phylogenomic data for future research. A taxonomic catalogue of Hyocephalidae is supplemented. The neotype designation for Hyocephalus aprugnus Bergroth, 1906 made by Š TYS (1964) and supported by G RANT &amp; Š TYS (1970) is found invalid.",

The fossil subfamily Propreocorinae Popov, Dolling &amp; Whalley, 1994, recently excluded from Ochteridae by other authors, is formally raised to family rank as Propreocoridae stat. nov. The fossil genus Meropachys Popov, 1986 is found to be a junior homonym of Meropachys Burmeister, 1835 (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Coreidae) and is replaced by a new substitute name, Yuripachys nom. nov., resulting in one new combination: Yuripachys dubius (Popov, 1986) comb. nov. Neochterus Mahner, 1993 (originally proposed as subgenus of Ochterus Latreille, 1807) is considered an unavailable name. Ochterus papaceki Kment &amp; Carapezza sp. nov. is described and illustrated as a new species from the island of Socotra (Yemen) and Tanzania. Gender agreement in Ochterus paucistriata Baehr, 1990 is corrected to O. paucistriatus Baehr, 1990. The name Ochterus perbosci (Guérin-Méneville, 1843), an incorrect subsequent spelling of O. perboscii in prevailing usage, is fixed according to Article 33.3.1 of the ICZN (1999). The spelling of Angulochterus quadrimaculatus Yao, Zhang &amp; Ren, 2011 is corrected according to Article 32.5.1 of ICZN (1999). The original publication of Ochterus barberi Schell, 1943, O. bidentatus Schell, 1943, O. hungerfordi Schell, 1943, and O. parvus Schell, 1943 is clarified. The name bearing types of Ochterus barberi, O. bidentatus, O. hungerfordi, O. parvus, O. perbosci, and Pelogonus splendidulus Montandon, 1898 (= Ocyochterus victor (Bolívar, 1879)) are considered as lectotypes. The family Ochteridae currently includes 3 recent genera and 88 described species group taxa (84 species and 4 subspecies): Megochterus Jaczewski, 1934 (2 species from Australia), Ochterus (80 species and 4 subspecies distributed worldwide), and Ocyochterus Drake &amp; Gómez-Menor, 1954 (2 species from NW South America). The fossil record of Ochteridae currently includes 4 genera and 5 species: Angulochterus Yao, Zhang &amp; Ren, 2011 (1 species from Early Cretaceous of China), Floricaudus Yao, Ren &amp; Shih, 2011 (1 species from Early Cretaceous of China), Pristinochterus Yao, Cai &amp; Ren, 2007 (2 species from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous of China), and Riegerochterus Popov &amp; Heiss, 2014 (1 species from Miocene Dominican amber). In addition the fossil genus Yuripachys (1 species from Early Creatceous of Mongolia) is classified as Ochteridae incertae sedis, Propreocoris Popov, Dolling &amp; Whalley, 1994 (1 species from Early Jurassic of England) as common ancestor of Ochteridae and Gelastocoridae in its own family Propreocoridae, and Grimaldinia Popov &amp; Heiss, 2014 (1 species from Burmese Amber) and Heterochterus Evans, 1971 (1 species based on an isolated wing, Late Triassic of Australia) as Ochteroidea incertae sedis.

On the contrary, the Blattaria, Psocoptera, and Mecoptera are defi nitely paraphyletic (with respect of the Isoptera, Phthiraptera, and Siphonaptera, respectively), and the Phthiraptera are possibly diphyletic. Small relictual subclades that are closely related to the Isoptera, Phthiraptera, and Siphonaptera were identifi ed (Cryptocercidae, Lipo- scelididae, and Boreidae, respectively), which provides an enormous amount of evidence about the origin and early evolution of the highly apomorphic eusocial or parasitic ex-groups. Position of the enigmatic 'zygentoman' Tricholepidion Wygodzinsky, 1961, remains uncertain. Possible non-monophyly of the Megalo- ptera (with respect of the Raphidioptera) and the Phasmatodea (with respect of the Embioptera) are shortly discussed.",

Ochthebius capicola (s. str.) is apparently restricted to the Benguela Ecoregion on the west coast, being replaced by Ochthebius mlamboi sp. nov., in south and east coast localities influenced by the Agulhas Current, including areas of the Eastern Cape province well outside the previous known range of these beetles. The distribution and ecology of the two species is discussed, with reference to biogeographic breaks in southern African coastal taxa, and the emerging view that many ‘widespread’ coastal rock pool Ochthebius may actually be (semi-) cryptic species complexes.",

The examination of the voucher specimens identifi ed as Halyomorpha timorensis by Mayr, a syntype of Halys timorensis, and syntypes of Pentatoma halys Stål, 1855 revealed that: i) Halyomorpha timorensis (Westwood), stat. restit., must be reinstated as a valid species, and not considered as a junior subjective synonym of H. picus; ii) Mayr’s specimens belong to two different species, Halyomorpha halys (Stål) and H. picus. The problem of double misidentification of the type species of Halyomorpha is resolved by action of the first revising author(s) according to the Article 70.3 of the ICZN (1999): we fi x here Pentatoma halys Stål, 1855 (= Halys timorensis sensu Mayr, nec Westwood) as the type species of Halyomorpha Mayr, 1864. A list of 36 valid species currently placed in Halyomorpha and their synonyms is compiled. We also issue a warning concerning the use of the citizen science approach for monitoring H. halys in Southeast Asia (which may also apply to other taxa): It is necessary to keep in mind that H. halys belongs to a group of habitually similar species (distributed from Pakistan and southern China to Indonesia and the Philippines) which cannot be identified with certainty without examination of their male genitalia; records merely based on observations or habitus photographs cannot be accepted as reliable.",

    "abstract": "We here present the first integrative revision of the subgenus Quedius Stephens, 1829 sensu stricto where taxonomic decisions are based on morphology, genomic phylogeny (published elsewhere) and single locus DNA evidence. The subgenus is restricted to the Holarctic region and includes some of the largest, most robust members of the genus Quedius. For species delimitation, a total of 200 COI barcodes covering nearly all species within the subgenus were evaluated through phylogenetic, cluster and network analysis. Taxonomic, distributional and bionomic data, all hitherto published and new are synthesized and an identification key is constructed for all species. All 20 species of Quedius s. str. are divided into five species groups based on genomic phylogeny, morphology, distributional patterns and practical considerations. Overall, there was good congruence among various lines of evidence. As exceptions, high COI barcode variability was found within the wingless and patchily distributed Q. unicolor Kiesenwetter, 1847 and Q. sundukovi Smetana, 2003 (3 and 5 BOLD BINs, respectively) from the Q. molochinus-group without corresponding morphological or geographic patterns. On the contrary, in the Q. pallipes-group very little divergence in the COI barcode was found between clearly morphologically separated species. From the taxonomically challenging Nearctic Quedius molochinoides-group, Quedius altanai Hansen &amp; Brunke sp. nov. is described as new species from the central and southern Rockies, rendering Q. lanei Hatch, 1957 to be restricted to the eastern foothills of the Cascades, Sierra Nevada and Blue Mountains. In the case of Q. subunicolor and Q. altaicus, continuous morphological and COI variation firmly established the earlier suspected synonymy Quedius subunicolor Korge, 1961 = Quedius altaicus Korge, 1962 syn. nov. Other new synonyms established here are: Quedius pallipes Lucas, 1849 = Quedius simplicifrons Fairmaire, 1861 syn. nov. = Quedius levasseuri Coiffait, 1964 syn. nov.; Quedius hispanicus Bernhauer, 1898 stat. reinstituted = Quedius cobosi Coiffait, 1964 syn. nov.; Quedius fuliginosus (Gravenhorst, 1802) = Quedius latus Hochhuth, 1851 syn. nov. = Quedius viduus Sawada, 1965, syn. nov. Quedius gracilis Stephens, 1832 syn. rev. is moved from synonymy with Q. fuliginosus and placed into synonymy with Q. curtipennis Bernhauer, 1908, the younger being the valid name due to prevailing usage in accordance with the ICZN Article 23.9; Quedius hammianus Sharp, 1911 syn. revid., Q. secundus Last, 1952 syn. revid., and Q. rufulus Blümml, 1898 syn. revid., are moved from synonymy with Q. simplicifrons and placed into synonymy with Q. hispanicus Bernhauer, 1898; Quedius sardous Gridelli, 1924 syn. revid., and Q. leonhardi Bernhauer, 1914 syn. revid., are moved from synonymy with Q. molochinus (Gravenhorst, 1806) to synonymy with Q. pallipes. Human mediated dispersals, most likely through the historical transport of ship ballast, are noted as regular phenomenon for some members of the subgenus. Quedius fuliginosus, Q. curtipennis and Q. molochinus, introduced from the Palearctic to the Nearctic, are the most noticeable examples.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The flower- or hoverflies (Syrphidae) and particularly the subfamily Eristalinae, are known by their importance as pollinators in both natural and agro-ecosystems. Similar to other saprophagous eristalines, the larvae of Eristalis Latreille, 1804 are characterized by an elongated anal segment and a telescopic breathing tube. These features have given them the common name of rat-tailed maggots and allow them to develop in liquid or semi-liquid media loaded with decaying organic material. This paper presents the first description of the egg and the third-instar larva of the boreal species Eristalis fratercula (Zetterstedt, 1838). Morphological studies are presented based on cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM). After comparison with all other known species of the genus Eris-talis with described preimaginal morphology, we conclude that main diagnostic character of E. fratercula is the presence of long branched spicules located in the upper margin on the lateral lips. Finally, we provide an updated key that includes the 15 Eristalis species whose third larval stages have already been described.",

Adult females of D. sinuata excavate holes with their mandibles on intermediate-sized internodes of recently dead culms of the bamboo Sinobambusa sat (Balansa) C. S.

    "abstract": "The genus Satonius Endrody-Younga, 1997, is revised. Three new spe- cies are described from China: Satonius schoenmanni sp. nov. (Hunan province), S. stysi sp. nov. (Yunnan province), and S. wangi sp. nov. (Zhejiang province). Two additional new species from the Chinese provinces Fujian and Anhui are left undescribed pending the collection of complete specimens and males, respecti- vely. Metathoracic wing venation of S. stysi sp. nov. is shown to differ from the remaining Myxophaga in the presence of the bifurcation of AA 3+4 , which updates the venation groundplan of the suborder. Anterolateral spine-like projection of the metaventrite and the increased number of apical setae on parameres are defi ned as adult autapomorphies of the genus. Larvae of S. stysi sp. nov. are described and compared with the larvae of the Japanese S. kurosawai (Sato, 1982). Characters shared by larval Satonius and Ytu Reichardt, 1973 (extremely fl attened body covering legs, and modifi ed orientation and unusual morphology of legs) are supposed as parallel adaptations for the larval environment - very thin fi lm of water in seepage habitats. Interspecifi c wing polymorphism of Satonius is briefl y discussed and possible reasons of the wide distribution of the apterous S. kuro- sawai are hypothesized.",

The last instar larva of O. depressa exhibits the characters traditionally recognized as diagnostic of the genus, i.e. the tip of the mandible obtuse, and the fourth maxillary palpomere long, almost as long as third palpomere. Ora depressa is characterized by a broadly elliptical body, which is widest at the metanotum, being brownish testaceous in color with several brown spots, having the dorsal surface mostly covered with numerous grooved scale-like setae and also several ungrooved scale-like setae, hair-like setae, club-like setae and pore-like sensilla distributed in a specific pattern, and the femur and tibiotarsus bearing a row of natatorial setae. The last instar larva of Ora depressa can be distinguished from those of the other known species of the genus by lobes of clypeolabrum being as long as wide and socket bristles with 2–6 inner teeth. The pupa of O. depressa differs from those of the other known species of the genus in the absence of pronotal horns and by the place where pupation occurs. Ora depressa pupates underwater, hanging from water’s surface with the aid of the laterally expanded pronotum which bears hydrophobic setation along the lateral margins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Entomological collections are the target of various insect pests, e.g. carpet beetles (Dermestidae) and booklice (Psocoptera) which can damage and completely destroy dry specimens in a relatively short time. Collections in the National Museum, Czech Republic (NMP) including the entomological ones are protected by fumigation using commercially available smoke shells ‘Cytrol Super SG’; fumigation is performed twice a year. The active insecticidal substance of these smoke shells is cypermethrin (6.25%). We tested whether the repeated cypermethrin fumigation of the NMP entomological collections negatively affects the quality of mitochondrial DNA in dry specimens and prevents the subsequent use of these samples for molecular analyses required for identification, taxonomy, systematics, and phylogenetic studies. We used 32 freshly fixed specimens of the flower chafer Oxythyrea funesta (Poda von Neuhaus, 1761) and 32 freshly fixed specimens of the brown-tailed cockroach Supella longipalpa (Fabricius, 1798). One half of specimens of both species was stored outside NMP and not fumigated (negative control), and the other half was deposited in collection hall with the NMP insect collection and directly exposed to the fumigation. Subsequently, all specimens were processed in a molecular laboratory under a standardized protocol using one leg as the source tissue after each fumigation, and the 658 bp long barcoding region of the cytochrome oxidase I ( cox1 ) as the testing gene fragment. Results of the PCR product electrophoresis and the sequences acquired confirmed that the repeated fumigation had no negative effect on tested samples.",

    "abstract": "The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, 1909, is an important structural pest in Mainland China, Japan, Taiwan, Bahamas, and the United States. Coptotermes formosanus was first described in Japanese, and the morphological description was too simple for congeneric species differentiation, resulting in confusion in species identification. To date, ten junior synonyms of C. formosanus have been reported. To avoid further confusion, we redescribed C. formosanus based on the type specimen and the specimens from the type locality, Taiwan. Most of the Coptotermes Wasmann, 1896 taxonomy has been clarified worldwide and the Chinese case remains an outlier, with many species that need to be revised. We further examined the taxonomic statuses of four Chinese species, C. chang­taiensis Xia &amp; He, 1986, C. hekouensis Xia &amp; He, 1986, C. shanghaiensis Xia &amp; He, 1986, and C. suzhouensis Xia &amp; He, 1986. We proposed that C. changtaiensis, C. hekouensis, and C. suzhouensis are the junior synonyms of C. formosanus. Even though the morphological characters of C. shanghaiensis are similar to C. formosanus, the body size of the former is significantly smaller. Additional Coptotermes samples collected from the Shanghai area would be required for the taxonomic status of C. shanghaiensis to be confirmed.",

Montina calarca sp. nov. is distinguished by the reddish coloration with black head and legs; densely setose pronotum; connexival margin rounded on segments 4, 5, and 6 without protuberances, connexivum black with a narrow red band on margin; and translucent yellow membrane with hyaline cells and darkened veins. Montina gladiator sp. nov. is distinguished by the red coloration, with black legs, scutellum, and abdomen; connexival margin 4–5 lobed, 6 straight, segments 2–4 with acute posterior process on each segment, connexivum dark brown to black with a narrow red band on its margin. Montina tikuna sp. nov. is distinguished by the reddish-brown coloration, with black scutellum and abdomen; connexival margin nearly straight, segments 2–4 with small posterior acute process, 5–6 with obtuse process, connexivum black; ventral laterotergites only with black scattered erect setae.

One species occurs from Central Europe into Transcaucasia and agrees with the taxon O. brevicornis of Loew (1843). The second species, O. atlantica Żóralski &amp; Van de Meutter sp. nov., has its main distribution range in the Atlantic parts of Europe and is described here. We provide a redescription of O. brevicornis and designate a neotype from the type locality (Poland, Posen [= Poznań] vicinity). The most important characters for distinguishing males of these two closely related species are in the structures of the terminalia. A diagnosis and identification key to European black-legged Orthonevra species is given as well as new sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), also known as DNA barcodes, for most of the species of this group. Some new information and changes to the known ranges of Orthonevra species are provided as a result of this revisionary work: O. frontalis (Loew, 1843) is removed from the list of species occurring in Poland; O. gemmula Violovitsh, 1979 is confirmed from Hungary; O. incisa (Loew, 1843) is confirmed from its locus typicus (Poland, Posen vicinity); and O. montana Vujić, 1999 is reported from Poland and Austria for the first time and confirmed for Germany.

    "abstract": "The genus Dicyphus Fieber, 1858 (Miridae: Bryocorinae: Dicyphini) comprises small plant bugs well known for their zoophytophagous diet and predatory activity, making them useful in biological control. Despite their importance in plant protection, many species remain difficult or impossible to identify. This is the case of both species Dicyphus (Dicyphus) bolivari Lindberg, 1934 and Dicyphus (Dicyphus) tamaninii Wagner, 1951, commonly found in vegetable crops in Western Europe. We have conducted a taxonomic study integrating morphological (including male and female genitalia), molecular, biogeographical, and biological data. The following new synonymy is proposed: Dicyphus bolivari Lindberg, 1934 = Dicyphus tamaninii Wagner, 1951, syn. nov. The synonymies established by Sanchez &amp; Cassis (2018), Dicyphus bolivari Lindberg, 1934 = Dicyphus bolivari atlanticus Wagner, 1951 = D. maroccanus Wagner, 1951, are confirmed. Dicyphus bolivari is compared to closely related species. The following country records are added to D. bolivari range: Channel Islands: Guernsey, Italy: Sardinia, Monaco, Asian part of Turkey and Cyprus.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated sexual dimorphism in puparia of four whiteflies, viz., Aleyrodes sp. on Oxalis corniculata (Oxalidaceae), Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius, 1889) on Solanum melongena (Solanaceae), Dialeurodes delhiensis David & Sundararaj, 1992 on Ficus virens (Moraceae), and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood, 1856) on Phaseolus vulgaris (Fabaceae), based on a set of ten morphometric characters analysed by univariate and multivariate statistics. Differences between males and females in means of the selected ten characters and in several character ratios were highly significant. The multivariate analyses including principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) revealed that sex can be reliably identified in puparia in these species based on a combination of characters such as the length and width of puparia irrespective of species; length of caudal furrow for Aleyrodes sp., D. delhiensis and T. vaporariorum; length of the seventh abdominal segment for D. delhiensis and T. vaporariorum; width of operculum alone for Aleyrodes sp.; and length of vasiform orifice (LVO) alone for B. tabaci; and the combination of some of their ratios. Identification of puparium sex is important for studies in taxonomy, biology and pest management of whiteflies. The results of this study show that morphometrics can provide a useful tool for its diagnosis and accurate identification.",

As with a number of primarily northern temperate lineages, the genus has colonised the Afrotropical Region, with species described from the Ethiopian Highlands and southern Africa. Here, the Afrotropical Helophorus fauna is revised, based on a study of all primary types and additional material, including extensive recent collections from South Africa. The known Afrotropical fauna is shown to be comprised of six species, only three of which were previously described: H. aethiopicus Régimbart, 1907, from southern highland areas of Ethiopia, H. aethiops J. Balfour-Browne, 1954 known from summer and year-round rainfall areas of South Africa and Namibia and H. cooperi Orchymont, 1948, stat. nov., described as a subspecies of H. aethiopicus and still only known from the type locality in Ethiopia. To these, three new species are added: H. brumopluvialis sp. nov., widespread in winter rainfall areas of the Western and Northern Cape Provinces of South Africa, H. nyandaruaensis sp. nov. from mountains of the East African Rift in Kenya and H. simiensis sp. nov. from the Simien Mountains of northern Ethiopia. All species are (re)described in detail and illustrated with high-resolution photos. Known distributions are mapped and a key to species provided. It is suggested that the two South African species may have speciated allochronically, due to seasonal shifts in life cycle associated with the development of the winter rainfall regime in the Cape during the Plio-Pleistocene. Helophorus are hypothesised to have colonised the Afrotropics on at least two occasions from separate Palaearctic ancestors.",

Larvae were obtained by laboratory rearing and field collecting; field collected larvae were identified by morphological comparison with those reared in the laboratory. Larval morphology of C. abnormalis corresponds with that of C. nitescens (Fauvel, 1883) except for the serrate margin of the nasale in C. abnormalis. We confirm that Crephelochares does not construct the usual egg case, and report active behaviour of its larvae, possibly indicating they are not ambush predators. Larval morphology of P. atropiceus corresponds with that of P. foveicollis; on the other hand, we conclude that the larvae previously described as Peltochares from Madagascar belong to Tritonus Mulsant, 1844 of the tribe Laccobiini. The egg-carrying behaviour of Peltochares is confirmed. We briefly summarize the state of the knowledge of immature stages of the Acidocerinae, indicating that a special effort in discovering and describing immature stages from northern South America and Brazil is needed.",

    "abstract": "A new species of scarab beetle, Termitotrox icarus sp. nov., is described from central Myanmar, being the third representative of the genus Termitotrox Reichensperger, 1915 from the Indo-Chinese Subregion of the Oriental Region. The majority of the type series was collected from the walls of fungus garden chambers built in the nests of the termite Odontotermes proformosanus Ahmad, 1965. Termitotrox icarus sp. nov. can be easily distinguished from the known Termitotrox as it possesses wing-shaped trichomes on the elytra, the more elongate habitus shape in dorsal view, the basomedian section of pronotum not protruding backwards, a pair of distinct costae on the pronotal basomedian section strongly developed, a median costa on anterior pronotal margin strongly developed, the elytral striae narrower than interstriae, the lack of trichomes at the base of elytral sutural stria, and a mid-range body length of 1.5–1.9 mm. The ‘carrying behavior’ by the host termites is reported for the first time for Termitotrox and a strategy for the dispersal of flightless termitophilous scarabs is hypothesized.",

The history of Plecoptera research in the Czech Republic is briefl y summarized. Altogether 95 species are recorded from the Czech Republic (85 species from Bohemia, 81 species from Moravia). In comparison with the previous checklist of Plecoptera, 13 species were added, 8 previously mentioned species were not confirmed, and some misidentifi cations are discussed. The distribution of species in eight districts based on main river basins, and species frequencies of occurrence and ranges of altitude and stream order of their localities are presented. Evaluation of data on species distribution from the past century enabled re-evaluation of threatened species. The new red list includes 5 regionally extinct, 6 critically endangered, 3 endangered, 10 vulnerable and 12 near threatened species. A special attention is paid to 8 species described from the present territory of the Czech Republic. Their type material, type localities and nomenclature are given and discussed.

This genus comprises 17 described species divided in four species groups: H. quadridens, H. oxyacanthus, H. triangularis, and H. balteatus species group. Also, there is a large number of new species yet to be described. The H. balteatus species group is diagnosed by: pronotum with posterior stripe smoky brown to black with black punctures within, sometimes these punctures are surrounded by small dark spots; punctures of the pronotal disc smaller and paler than those of the posterior stripe; anterolateral margin of pronotum yellow; anterior half of scutellum with punctures large, sparse, and also on dark spots; connexivum uniformly green, without dark spots; thorax ventrally with two pairs of brown to black rounded spots; apex of pseudosutures with black to brown round spots. This species group included so far only H. balteatus (Walker, 1868). Here we describe and assign 15 new species to this group: H. amyoti sp. nov. (Suriname: Powakka; French Guiana), H. aspilogaster sp. nov. (Brazil: Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro), H. belenensis sp. nov. (Brazil: Pará), H. bergrothi sp. nov.

Specifi c host associations for T. saundersi in Iceland previ- ously were unknown. Larvae and adults fed mainly on leaves and stems of their graminoid hosts; during cloudy weather, the bugs were observed in thatch beneath host plants. An adult fed on nectar from a fl ower of arctic sea rocket, Cakile arctica (Brassicaceae). Larvae and adults fed occasionally as predators or scavengers on small Diptera and pierced human skin. Observations on zoophagy further docu- ment the use of animal matter by species of Teratocoris Fieber, 1858, whereas adventitious biting by T. saundersi is reported for the fi rst time. The zoophagous tendencies of T. saundersi might contrast with the feeding habits of stenodemines that are regarded as strict phytophages, for example, most species of Stenodema Laporte, 1833 and Trigonotylus Fieber, 1858.",

An additional species, Acartophthalmites clusioides sp. nov., is described based on a well preserved male in a Baltic amber inclusion from Kaliningrad: Yantarny (Russia). It distinctly differs from A. tertiaria in a number of characters demonstrating that the genus Acartophthalmites is morphologically more diverse than considered previously. Moreover, the study of A. clusioides resulted in finding that Acartophthalmites is obviously not related to Acartophthalmidae (where it was originally affiliated), but seems to be closer to Clusiidae, although surely not belonging to the latter family as currently delimited. Therefore a revision of all available specimens of Acartophthalmites is suggested to gain a more complete set of morphological data of this genus, enabling analysis of its phylogenetic relationships.",

Hypocaccus virescens Thérond, 1963 is transferred from the subgenus Baeckmanniolus Reichardt, 1926 to Hypocaccus s. str. Thomson, 1867 based on external morphology. Most taxa, albeit determined only up to their (sub)generic rank, are recorded from Socotra for the first time. Due to poor understanding of their taxonomy, or lack of determination keys to the following (sub)genera: Tribalus Erichson, 1834, Plegaderus ( Plegaderus ) Erichson, 1834, Acritus ( Acritus ) LeConte, 1853, and Teretrius ( Teretrius ) Erichson, 1834, their representatives from Socotra are left without identification pending revisions. The Socotran histerid fauna has been found to consist mainly of widely distributed African, Arabian/Near Eastern taxa, as well as local endemics. The occurrence of the (predominantly Holarctic) genus Plegaderus and the exclusively southeast Asian genus Liopygus Lewis, 1891 in Socotra is highly interesting.",

There is some taxonomic obscurity concerning the distinction between two of the three valid species, C. sauteri (Forel, 1913) and C. costatus (Bharti &amp; Wachkoo, 2013), resulting from previous unavailability of C. sauteri type material and inconsistency in descriptions provided in previous literature. In the present study, we examined the C. sauteri syntype and the C. costatus holotype as well as newly collected material and vouchers used in previous literature. Although both of the species agreed well with each other in most morphological characters of the worker, we tentatively retain the separation of these species based on differences in the head sculpture, eye and ocelli sizes. The worker, queen, and male of C. sauteri , and the worker of C. costatus are here redescribed with the first provision of COI DNA barcode data. In addition, C. merimbunensis Yamada &amp; Eguchi sp. nov. is described from Brunei based on workers and males from a single colony. A key to valid Chrysapace species is also provided.",

Externally, these species share many characters with members of the SE Asian, Sundaland group within the genus. However, male genitalic structures of some of them resemble aedeagi of Australian Paraneseuthia , supporting previous phylogeographic hypotheses that assumed the origins of both north-eastern (Far Russian and Japanese) and south-eastern (Australian and Melanesian) Paraneseuthia from a Sundaland ancestor. The aedeagus of P. morobensis sp. nov. shows intermediary shape and structures between those of P. quadrifoveata Jałoszyński, 2010 of Borneo, Sabah, and that of P. levigata Jałoszyński, 2010 of eastern Papua New Guinea. The aedeagus of P. tanimbariana sp. nov., in turn, shows a striking similarity to that of the northern Australian P. angustifurculata Jałoszyński, 2013 and other species known to occur in Australia. The male genitalia of P. luzonica sp. nov. (the first species discovered in the Philippines), and especially of P. kaibesariana sp. nov., add unique features to the already known, great morphological diversity of the SE Asian members of Paraneseuthia that occupy the presumable evolutionary cradle of this genus.",

    "abstract": "The trictenotomid genus Autocrates Thomson, 1860 is remarkable for its large and robust adults, but its larval morphology and bionomics have been unknown over the last 160 years. Here, we describe and illustrate in detail the eggs, and also the first and last instar larva and the pupa of Autocrates maqueti Drumont, 2006, based on specimens reared from identiﬁed adults collected in South Korea. The first instar larva is very similar to the known trictenotomid larvae of the genus Trictenotoma Gray, 1832, sharing the following features: distinctly flattened and parallel-sided, well-sclerotized head and largely unpigmented postcephalic body, lyre-shaped frontal arms, very short coronal suture, five pairs of stemmata, asymmetrical and tridentate mandibles with mola, simple and apically upturned urogomphi, and absence of longitudinal ridges on the thorax and abdomen. Differences occur in the primary chaetotaxy. The last instar larva is almost identical with Trictenotoma in general appearance, but the longitudinal tergal ridges of Autocrates are much denser and more widely distributed than those of Trictenotoma. Our preliminary assessment of features of immature stages confirms a close relationship of Trictenotomidae with the “salpingid group”, i.e. Salpingidae, Boridae, Pyrochroidae and Pythidae. A sister group relationship with Pythidae is likely. The putative synapomorphy is the subdivision of the ventral element of tergites IX, even though this condition is not visible in the first instars of Autocrates, and quite indistinct (but recognizable) in the last larval stage. The complete mitochondrial genome of A. maqueti is provided. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis of trictenotomid species is presented using two mitochondrial genes (16S and COI). The morphology of eggs and biological information on feeding and oviposition behaviors are also provided with photographs of adults and eggs.",

    "abstract": "We use DNA sequence data to generate the first phylogenetic hypothesis for the weevil tribe Lymantini. These are leaf litter inhabiting beetles generally regarded as restricted to the New World and taxonomically arranged in two subtribes, 11 genera and some 150 named species. An additional genus of questionable affinities to the tribe, Devernodes Grebennikov, 2018, has five described species in Southeastern Asia. All these beetles are flightless and some have eyes reduced in size or absent, traits normally associated with limited dispersal capacity. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of 153 terminals (50 of them belong to Lymantini representing Devernodes and all but three named genera) based on 4,174 bp alignment of one mitochondrial (cox1) and two nuclear fragments (ITS2 and 28S). We find that both Lymantini subtribes Lymantina and Caecossonina are monophyletic, the latter sister to the amphi-Atlantic tribe Anchonini. The Asian genus Devernodes is deeply nested among American Lymantina. The clade of Anchonini plus Lymantini is consistently recovered outside of the CCCMS clade of “higher” weevils (Curculioninae, Conoderinae, Cossoninae, Molytinae and Scolytinae). We hypothesize that the polished head capsule of adult beetles is an apomorphy of Anchonini and Lymantini, the 8-segmented antennal funicle is an apomorphy of Anchonini plus Caecossonina. We attribute the origin of the currently observed amphi-Pacific distribution of Lymantina to normal ecological dispersal facilitated by the warmer periods of the Cenozoic such as the Eocene, and by presently submerged Arctic land bridges. Using parsimony we hypothesize a North American origin for the Anchonini plus Lymantini crown group, as well as that of Lymantina. We argue that Bronchotibia adunatus Poinar &amp; Legalov, 2021, a Dominican amber adult weevil fossil, is not a member of Lymantini and re-classify it as Curculionidae incertae sedis. We present an image gallery of 28 Lymantini specimens to document the morphological diversity of the tribe. We hypothesize the existence of unnamed American genera of Lymantina and make public the DNA-barcode dataset of 89 Lymantini specimens.",

    "abstract": "Several names of Gyrinidae taxa have been found in the literature which are given with incorrect publishing dates. The correct data could be assigned to these taxa by specifying the true publishing dates mainly of five important works: Aube’s ‘Species general’ is dated September 29, 1838, and the third part of his ‘Iconographie’ December 31, 1838; Hatch’s ‘Phylogeny of Gyrinidae’ is dated 1926 instead of 1925; Modeer’s work on Gyrinidae is dated 1780 instead of 1776; Ochs’ works on Dineutini are dated again 1926 instead of 1927. Incorrectly cited publishing data of a few further works are also rectified. Nomenclatural notes on several names in the family Gyrinidae are provided. These are on generic level Potamobius Stephens, 1829b, and Potamobius Hope, 1838, which are both junior subjective synonyms of Orectochilus Dejean, 1833 as well as junior primary homonyms of Potamobius Samouelle, 1819 (Decapoda), and thus they are permanently invalid. Five specific names were found to be junior primary homonyms. One of them, Gyrinus orientalis Regimbart, 1883 is replaced by Gyrinus mauricei nom. nov. Three names are not only junior homonyms, but also junior subjective synonyms, and thus no replacement name is currently needed: Gyrinus striatus Olivier, 1795, Gyrinus urinator Drapiez, 1819, and Gyrinus lineatus Lacordaire, 1835. Gyrinus oblongus Boisduval, 1835 is another junior primary homonym, but this name is conserved by application of Articles 23.9.1 and 23.9.2 of the ICZN (1999). The lectotype of Dytiscus natator Linnaeus, 1758 (currently in Gyrinus Geoffroy, 1762) is designated as the neotype of Gyrinus pygolampis Modeer, 1780 for stabilising the nomenclature; Gyrinus pygolampis thus becomes a junior objective synonym of G. natator.

Balfour-Browne, 1939, described from Vanuatu and the Solomons, currently considered a junior subjective synonym of P. semperi Régimbart, 1899, is reinstituted as a valid species based on its morphology and a molecular analysis by Toussaint et al. (2017). The paratypes of P. insularis from the Solomons are shown to belong to a new species – P. owaraha sp. nov., and, thus, the distribution of P. insularis is restricted to Vanuatu. Habitus and male genitalia are illustrated for all seven new species and P. insularis. A checklist of Dytiscidae so far recorded from the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu is appended.",

All specimens were sampled by sifting, and Hydraena mulanje sp. nov. and Ochthebius erinaceus sp. nov. appear to be terrestrial, in forest litter.

Here we describe two new sympatrically distributed species from Mount Fanjing, Guizhou Province, Southwest China. Songius brevisetus sp. nov. is characterized by the relatively parallel-sided body with a densely setose integument, and different forms of the spines/projections of the legs and the aedeagus. Songius hubenqii sp. nov. differs in the shiny, almost asetose body segments and antennomeres 1–6, the mesofemora lacking tubercles and bearing long bristles on the ventral margins, and a different form of the aedeagus. A re-examination of the types and additional material supported the conclusion that S. hlavaci Zhao, Yin &amp; Li, 2010 is a widely distributed species in eastern, central and southwestern China, leading to the placement of S. pseudohlavaci Yin &amp; Li 2015, syn. nov. from Hunan as its junior synonym; and the species is newly recorded from Fujian and Chong­qing.

A total of 19 species are recognized based on unique DNA sequences, of which 13 are described as new to science: Planetella adami Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. aestivalis Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. antennata Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. atrobrunnea Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. attilai Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. csabai Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. davidi Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. galiciensis Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. hlisnikovskyi Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. muranica Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. riparia Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., P. submontana Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov., and P. thermophila Ševčík & Hippa sp. nov. Four previously described species are recognized in the collected material: Planetella arenariae (Rübsaamen, 1899b), P. fasciata (Meigen, 1818) sp. restit., P. gallarum (Rübsaamen, 1899a), and P. granifex (Kieffer, 1898). For each of these species, DNA sequences are provided, as well as detailed illustrations of the male terminalia and male flagellomeres. Four additional species are represented only with larva, female or incomplete specimens. The phylogeny of European Planetella is tentatively reconstructed based on the combined analysis of three gene markers (28S, 16S, COI), but without providing any new infrageneric classification. The phylogenetic placement of the genus Planetella within the subfamily Cecidomyiinae is reconstructed based on four gene markers (18S, 28S, 16S, COI). The monophyly of Planetella is well supported, as well as its placement in the supertribe Cecidomyiidi. The genera Acodiplosis Kieffer, 1895 and Putoniella Kieffer, 1896 appear as the closest relatives of Planetella. The delimitation of the tribe Hormomyiini is discussed.",

Without fine structure analysis of large population samples there is no hope to discover speciation traits and there is no chance to delineate young incipient sibling species with subtle but stable shape divergences. Phylogenetic species complexes of these incipient species are frequently mistaken with species polymorphism. However, historical polymorphism is a sympatric phenomenon based on discontinuous variation inside a panmictic population and not between geographically isolated populations. I continue to consider Potamophylax mista (Navas, 1918) a valid species following the evidence given by Oláh et al. (2013).",

They have been previously recorded from eight pentatomomorphan families belonging to Coreoidea, Lygaeoidea and Pyrrhocoroidea (Hemiptera: Heteroptera), found either in males, females or both sexes, and were thought to be absent in Pentatomoidea. We report here the first instance of uradenia in a pentatomoid genus, the African Dismegistus Amyot &amp; Serville, 1843 (Parastrachiidae). Only the male adult possesses uradenia located on the intersegmental membrane of segments VIII-IX. The only other genus of the family, Parastrachia Distant, 1883, as well as other examined genera belonging to pentatomoid families possibly related to Parastrachiidae (Cydnidae, Thyreocoridae), do not possess uradenia. The uradenia of Dismegistus exhibit the same fundamental structure as in other trichophoran families but differ by their dorso-lateral position (instead of ventral), and also by the paired orifices (instead of unpaired and median). The implications of the presence of uradenia within member of a pentatomoid genus are briefly discussed.",

Based on morphology and examination of type specimens, Catoclastus jaumesi Soula, 2010 is a new synonym of C. chevrolatii Solier, 1851, while Catoclastus rabinovichi Martínez, 1971 is transferred to the genus Mecopelidnota Bates, 1904, leading to Mecopelidnota rabinovichi (Martínez) as a new combination. Characters that characterize the genus, natural history, and distribution data are given. Implications and problems associated with intraspecific variability of C. chevrolatii are discussed.

The new species is otherwise easily distinguished from its two southern African relatives by the peculiarly shining and coarsely punctuated elytral surface, smaller average body sizes, narrower and at base much more acutely toothed tarsal claws, and the different male and female genitalia, more like those of Aristogethes rufofuscus. The larval hostplant of the new species is represented by Hermannia (Mahernia) paniculata Franch., a small eremic southern Arabian and Northeast African species, typically growing at low altitude in stony sub-desert habitats, close to the sea.

One species previously thought to be a member of Picrotus is transferred to a new genus: Callichrotus gimmeli gen. &amp; sp. nov. The largest species, T. michauxi, is endemic to the subantarctic islands while the rest are mainland. Four species of Thortus have eyes consisting of a single ommatidium. We determined the origin of microphthalmy and attempt to reconstruct the biogeography of Thortus with a morphological cladistic analysis that included Callichrotus and Picrotus as outgroups. Thortus michauxi was sister to remaining species with largely unresolved relationships and included two monophyletic clusters. Thortus amoenus (Broun, 1912), T. lobatus, and T. sulcatus formed a group based on the presence of a complete parasutural striae, and within it, the latter two species have parameres with posterior membranous extensions, which supports them as sister species. In some trees, T. bullerensis, T. parallelus, and T. ovalis are supported by a narrowly constricted frons, a character that is variable within the genus. Microphthalmy evolved multiple times in Thortus. Eye reduction in other New Zealand beetles is reviewed. Based on number of collection events and specimen counts, most species would be considered as rare, with six newly described species known from single locations, three species of which are known from singletons. Despite classed as rare, it is likely that most species may be protected from extinction because they live in reserves or national parks.",

Here, we describe and illustrate their early larval instars in details and compare them with the other Chauliognathini. The larvae are remarkably characterised especially by a long and thick pubescence, conspicuous roughness on the head and thoracic terga, and head with sharp lateral projections. These features are unique amongst the known Cantharidae larvae and do not confirm a previous hypothesis of close affinity between Psilorrhynchus Gemminger &amp; Harold, 1869 and bromeliad-inhabiting Chauliognathini species.",

A new species, E. matatiele sp. nov., in the previously monotypic subgenus Elaphinis s. str. and closely related to E. (E.) cinereonebulosa (De Geer, 1778), is described from the southern Drakensberg area near Matatiele (Eastern Cape, South Africa). Within Parelaphinis, two new species, P. umtamvuna sp. nov. and P. drakensbergica sp. nov. are described and compared with P. moesta (Gory &amp; Percheron, 1833) – hitherto the only member of the genus. The former is a mid- to lowland dweller, currently known only from the KwaZulu-Natal side of the Umtamvuna River valley (South Africa). The latter is a montane species apparently distributed across the eastern portion of the Drakensberg Escarpment, from the north-eastern Free State (South Africa) to eSwatini (formerly Swaziland). A review of the enigmatic species E. (Micrelaphinis) pumila Boheman, 1857, also presumably originating from the same broader region, reveals that only five specimens, three of which belong to the type series, are currently still traceable to accessible collections, while no further specimens have been found since the 19th century. It is here established that the type series collected by Wahlberg during the period 1838–1845 most likely originated from the Orange River valley, either in the Eastern Cape, Free State or Lesotho. As this area has been extensively transformed by agricultural and mining activities, as well as human settlements, it is hypothesized that the species may already be extinct. All the species analysed in detail are illustrated, and dichotomic keys to all species of both genera are provided to facilitate their identification.",

The latter two were later synonymized with P. sahlbergi. While observations in nature find both P. sahlbergi and P. multisignata co-occurring on the same host plant, subtle morphological differences suggested they may be distinct species. We tested the validity of the original species separation using additional morphological characters and available molecular sequence data. The new evidence supports Boheman’s original separation of species. Accordingly we remove P. multisignata stat. restit. and P. scenica stat. restit. from synonymy with P. sahlbergi and restore their species status. Mitochondrial gene sequence data suggest that P. sahlbergi and P. multisignata bear a closer relationship to other sympatric Plagiometriona species than they do to one another, raising the possibility that these two species have convergent morphologies due to their shared food plant. Biological and ecological notes are also given for these two sympatric species.",

    "abstract": "Nomenclatural notes on the names of several species in the family Gyrinidae are provided. Six specific names are found to be junior homonyms. Three of them are replaced by nomina nova: Aulonogyrus marginatus (Aubé, 1838) by Aulonogyrus charlesaubei nom. nov., Gyrinus dubius Wallis, 1926 by Gyrinus suspectus nom. nov., and Macrogyrus (Andogyrus) colombicus australis (Brinck, 1977) by Macrogyrus (Andogyrus) colombicus brincki nom. nov. The other three junior homonyms were never considered congeneric with senior homonyms after the year 1899, and thus cannot not be replaced by new names: Gyretes dorsalis (Brullé, 1837), Macrogyrus australis (Brullé, 1835), and Andogyrus glaucus (Aubé, 1838); it is proposed that these names will be conserved by a ruling of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. It is found that Enhydrus sulcatus (Forsberg, 1821) is a primary homonym and a junior subjective synonym of Enhydrus sulcatus (Wiedemann, 1821) in Wiedemann &amp; Germar (1821). The neotype is designated for Gyrinus striatus Fabricius, 1792, which is a senior primary homonym and a senior subjective synonym of G. striatus Olivier, 1792 (both currently in Aulonogyrus Motschulsky, 1853). Gyrinus striatus was published by Olivier not only in 1792, but again in the year 1795 (so far treated as the correct publishing year). To stabilise the nomenclature, one and the same specimen is designated simultaneously as the neotype for Gyrinus striatus Olivier, 1792, and G. striatus Olivier, 1795, and thus both names become objective synonyms. Gyrinus ovatus Klug, 1829 is a senior subjective synonym of Gyrinus gibbus Aubé, 1838 syn. nov. and of Gyrinus apicalis Sharp, 1878 syn. nov. Gyrinus racenisi Ochs, 1953 must be used as the valid name for Gyrinus ovatus sensu Aubé (1838b) (nec Klug 1829). Lectotypes are designated for Gyrinus apicalis Sharp, 1878, Gyrinus gibbus Aubé, 1838, Gyrinus ovatus Klug, 1829, and Gyrinus paykulli Ochs, 1927b. Type specimens and diagnostic characters are illustrated for G. striatus Fabricius, G. striatus Olivier, G. ovatus Klug, G. racenisi and G. paykulli.",

    "abstract": "The Immature Beetles Meeting is a traditional two-day get-together of the international coleopterologist community, aimed mainly at beetle larvae. Despite the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, the meeting took place on 30 September and 1 October in Prague. This year, the special pandemic conditions forced us to bring the meeting partially to the online space to make the attendance possible for all colleagues from all over the world. Therefore, the meeting went on in a hybrid – both personal and online – form. The meeting took place, as traditional, at the Faculty of Science, Charles University, and was co-organized by the Department of Entomology, National Museum in Prague, the Crop Research Institute in Prague and the Czech Entomological Society. In total, 22 participants attended the meeting in person (see Fig. 1), while another 11 participants presented their talks in the online meeting form. Many other colleagues also attended the meeting online, but unfortunately, we are not able to provide the full list of these participants. Most of the attendees who arrived personally were from the Czech Republic and other European countries; in the online session, also colleagues from Asia and South America attended the meeting as they presented their talks or posters, but we are also aware of people from North America, or Australia, who appeared in the online space as well. A total number of 14 contributions were presented, including 4 posters and 10 talks. The topics presented in the meeting covered a large spectrum of beetle families, including Cerambycidae, Coccinellidae, Hydrophilidae, Lucanidae, Lycidae, Phengodidae, Silphidae, Staphylinidae, Tenebrionidae and Trictenotomidae. Topics of general studies of beetle larvae were presented as well, including the modern methods of next-generation sequencing used in barcoding, biological sequence databases, and ecology. Moreover, the meeting continued as usual also in the evening after the session closure, in the informal “Larval Pub”, with discussions about beetles and life over a glass of the famous Czech beer. Although the meeting was largely affected by the specific conditions caused by the epidemic situation, we are happy that the pandemic couldn’t prevent the coleopterists from meeting and sharing interesting research topics again. Hopefully, next years will allow all colleagues to come to Prague in person again, to meet fully with a lot of fascinating presentations and nice (not only) beetle talks during the evening pub gatherings.

Similarly as two years ago, it took place at the Faculty of Science of the Charles University in Prague and was organized in the cooperation with the Department of Entomology of the National Museum and the Crop Research Institute in Prague. In total, 55 participants from Europe, North and South America and Asia attended the meeting (Fig. 1), including a large Brazilian delegation comprising students and scientists from three different universities. Nearly half of the participants attended the meeting for the first time, and we were again pleased to host not only the leading experts in beetle systematics (e.g., Pawel Jaloszynski, Jolanta Świetojanska, Josef Jelinek, Eugenio Nears, Nathan Lord and others), but also many pregraduate students. Seventeen oral lectures and two posters were presented, covering a wide spectrum of topics concerning nearly all major clades of beetles (Adephaga, Hydrophiloidea, Staphylinoidea, Scarabaeoidea, Elateroidea, Coccinelloidea, Cucujoidea, Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea), as well as possible Palaeozoic beetle larvae and methodologies of larval studies. As in previous years, the discussion about beetle topics continued even over the glass of Czech beer during both evenings. We hope that the meeting again served well its main purpose – to get together people with an interest in beetle systematics and start or maintain contacts and cooperation between coleopterologists across countries and generations.",

Here we describe a striking new species, Rhithrodytes pantaleonii sp. nov., discovered during recent fieldwork in southwestern Sardinia. The new species differs markedly from the only previously known Rhithrodytes from the Tyrrhenian Islands, R. sexguttatus (Aubé, 1838). The pale, flattened appearance of R. pantaleonii sp. nov., together with its small eyes and scarcity during collecting, all point to it being semisubterranean. A combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, obtained non-destructively from the holotype, allow us to reconstruct the evolutionary history and historical biogeography of this taxon and take the opportunity to publish the mitogenome of the new species. Rhithrodytes pantaleonii sp. nov. is shown to be sister to R. sexguttatus, these taxa apparently having diverged during the Miocene, when the Sulcis-Iglesiente region of southwestern Sardinia was separated from the rest of Corsico-Sardinia by the Sardinian Seaway. Our discovery adds to our understanding of the biogeography of the Tyrrhenian Islands, and further highlights the importance of the Sulcis-Iglesiente region as an area of endemism in its own right.",

    "abstract": "The knowledge of the diversity of leaf litter cerambycid fauna is limited, particularly in the Neotropics, where several species likely remain unreported. Most of these small and apterous beetles commonly belong to the tribe Apomecynini (Cerambycidae: Lamiinae). Herein, one new genus and two new species of Apomecynini are described and illustrated from material collected in leaf litter and subcortical habitats in Mexico: Enochlisi tlaloque sp. nov., from Cofre de Perote mountain, Veracruz, and Folilectia muye gen. &amp; sp. nov., from Xochicoatlán, Hidalgo. The new genus differs from related taxa in divided eyes, antennomere IV longer than scape, and elytra not vermiculated or tuberculated, elongate in the apical third. Enochlisi tlaloque differs from E. micri Santos-Silva 2022 mainly in size of antennae, pronotum coarsely punctate, and elytra weakly vermiculate, with distinctive pubescent color pattern.",

Based on comparison with melyrid species, the degree of miniaturization, dormancy behaviour, adaptation to the tropical and subtropical climates and the adaptive significance of a large first instar larva are all discussed.
